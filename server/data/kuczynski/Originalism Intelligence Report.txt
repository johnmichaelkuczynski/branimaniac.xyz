## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

1. **Primary Formulation:** Originalism is fundamentally flawed because the concept of "the intentions of the framers" is an idealization that cannot be empirically grounded, leading to circularity and triviality in constitutional interpretation.

2. **Secondary Formulation:** The intentions of the framers, when understood as a collective entity, are inseparable from the socio-historical role of the Constitution, which undermines the originalist position.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Idealization of Intentions:**
   - **Explanation:** The text argues that speaking of "the intentions of the framers" involves an idealization rather than an empirical reality. The framers had diverse and distinct psychologies, making it impossible to aggregate their intentions into a singular, collective intention.
   - **Supporting Evidence:** The text cites the different minds of Adams, Jefferson, and Washington, suggesting that their intentions could not be identical.

2. **Collective Entity Problem:**
   - **Explanation:** If originalism is to be viable, the intentions of the framers must be understood as those of a collective entity. However, the text argues that this collective intention cannot be understood purely in psychological terms.
   - **Supporting Evidence:** The text posits that the intentions must be understood in terms of their socio-historical role, which is inseparable from the Constitution itself.

3. **Circularity and Triviality:**
   - **Explanation:** The text argues that originalism leads to circularity because the intentions of the framers are to be understood in terms of the socio-historical role of the Constitution, which is itself the subject of interpretation.
   - **Supporting Evidence:** The text suggests that this circularity renders originalism trivial, as it does not provide a meaningful basis for constitutional interpretation.

4. **Counterfactual Reasoning:**
   - **Explanation:** The text critiques the use of counterfactuals in originalism, arguing that they are based on idealizations of the framers' values rather than empirical realities.
   - **Supporting Evidence:** The example of Jefferson's potential stance on gay marriage is used to illustrate that counterfactuals about the framers' intentions are not empirically grounded but are a priori propositions.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Psychological vs. Institutional Intentions:**
   - **Explanation:** The text distinguishes between psychological and institutional intentions, arguing that the latter are necessary for originalism but cannot be empirically derived.
   - **Supporting Evidence:** The text uses the analogy of "the average man" and "frictionless planes" to illustrate that collective intentions are idealizations.

2. **Temporal and Cultural Parochialism:**
   - **Explanation:** The text argues that the framers' views were influenced by their temporal and cultural context, which must be idealized away to make their intentions relevant to contemporary issues.
   - **Supporting Evidence:** The text cites examples such as the framers' potential views on African American voting rights and women in higher office to illustrate this point.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Empirical vs. Theoretical Constructs:** The text assumes a clear distinction between empirical realities and theoretical constructs, with the latter being necessary for constitutional interpretation.

2. **Relevance of Historical Context:** The text assumes that the historical context of the framers' lives is relevant to understanding their intentions but must be transcended for contemporary application.

3. **Value of Idealization:** The text assumes that idealization is a necessary tool for legal and philosophical analysis, particularly in the context of constitutional interpretation.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

1. **Premise 1:** The intentions of the framers are an idealization, not an empirical reality.
2. **Premise 2:** If originalism is to be viable, the intentions of the framers must be understood as those of a collective entity.
3. **Premise 3:** The intentions of the collective entity cannot be understood purely in psychological terms but must be understood in terms of their socio-historical role.
4. **Premise 4:** The socio-historical role of the framers' intentions is inseparable from the socio-historical role of the Constitution.
5. **Conclusion:** Originalism leads to circularity and triviality because it cannot provide a meaningful basis for constitutional interpretation based on the framers' intentions.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

1. **Primary Formulation:** The text argues that the originalist position in constitutional interpretation is undermined by a circularity inherent in the concept of "Jefferson's values," which is often invoked to justify originalist interpretations.

2. **Secondary Formulation:** The text posits that any attempt to derive a correct conception of constitutionality from counterfactuals about what historical figures like Jefferson would have said is doomed to fail due to the necessity of idealizing those figures, which in turn presupposes a conception of constitutionality.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Argument 1: Circularity in Jefferson's Values**
   - **Explanation:** The text argues that the concept of "Jefferson's values" is circular because it requires an idealization of Jefferson that is itself derived from a conception of constitutionality. This idealization cannot be used to justify an originalist interpretation without presupposing the very conception of constitutionality it is meant to support.
   - **Key Passage:** "But in that case, we are using the term 'Jefferson' not to refer to the actual Jefferson, but to some idealization of Jefferson that corresponds to a certain conception of how the country should be run and therefore, presumably, of how Constitutional issues are to be settled."

2. **Argument 2: Irrelevance of Actual Historical Figures' Views**
   - **Explanation:** The text contends that the actual views of historical figures like Jefferson are irrelevant to constitutional interpretation because those views are inevitably marred by cultural biases and limitations. Therefore, any attempt to base constitutional interpretation on those views is flawed.
   - **Key Passage:** "Even the finest minds are marred by ugly biases. For all we know, Jefferson might have thought that any expression of homosexuality should be illegal or, on the contrary, he might have secretly thought that men should be legally required to abstain from relations with women and to marry other men."

3. **Argument 3: Idealization and A Priori Propositions**
   - **Explanation:** The text argues that when we idealize historical figures like Jefferson, we replace empirical propositions about their psychology with a priori propositions about values. This shift undermines the empirical basis of originalism and introduces a circularity into the argument.
   - **Key Passage:** "Once we start dealing with an idealization of Jefferson's psyche, as opposed to his actual psyche, we have replaced empirical propositions about the Jefferson's psychology with a priori propositions about values."

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Subsidiary Claim 1: Small Government as an Independent Concept**
   - **Explanation:** The text acknowledges that Jefferson's belief in small government can be understood independently of constitutional interpretation, but argues that this does not resolve the circularity problem.
   - **Key Passage:** "Jefferson believed in certain things. For example, he believed that, with some obvious qualifications, people should be allowed to do as they wish and that, consequently, government should have a minimal regulatory role."

2. **Subsidiary Claim 2: Cultural Baggage and True Values**
   - **Explanation:** The text suggests that when we attribute certain views to Jefferson, we often do so by distinguishing between his "true" values and the cultural baggage that influenced his actual views. This distinction is problematic because it relies on an idealization of Jefferson.
   - **Key Passage:** "We effect this reconciliation by telling ourselves that, in answering that way, Jefferson was not being true to his core values. It wasn't the true Jefferson speaking. Rather, it was a Jefferson whose inner goodness was marred by cultural baggage that was extrinsic to his character."

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Assumption 1: Historical Figures' Views Are Inherently Flawed**
   - The text assumes that the views of historical figures like Jefferson are inevitably influenced by cultural biases and limitations, making them unreliable for contemporary constitutional interpretation.

2. **Assumption 2: Idealization Is Necessary for Constitutional Interpretation**
   - The text assumes that any attempt to use historical figures' views for constitutional interpretation requires idealizing those figures, which introduces circularity into the argument.

3. **Assumption 3: A Priori Propositions Cannot Ground Empirical Claims**
   - The text assumes that a priori propositions about values cannot serve as a basis for empirical claims about historical figures' psychology, undermining the originalist position.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

1. **Premise 1:** The concept of "Jefferson's values" is often used to justify originalist interpretations of the Constitution.

2. **Premise 2:** "Jefferson's values" refers to an idealization of Jefferson, not his actual views.

3. **Premise 3:** This idealization is derived from a conception of constitutionality.

4. **Premise 4:** Using an idealization derived from a conception of constitutionality to justify that conception is circular.

2. **Constitutionality:** The text repurposes the concept of constitutionality, arguing that it is presupposed in the idealization of historical figures like Jefferson, leading to circularity in the originalist position.

## SECTION 8: ARGUMENTATIVE STRUCTURE

### 8.1 Overall Organization of the Argument

1. **Introduction of the Problem:** The text begins by addressing a potential objection to its critique of originalism, specifically the claim that Jefferson's values can be understood independently of constitutional interpretation.

2. **Development of the Circularity Argument:** The text then develops its main argument by showing how the concept of "Jefferson's values" involves an idealization that presupposes a conception of constitutionality, leading to circularity.

3. **Use of Science Fiction Example:** A science fiction scenario is introduced to illustrate the problem of idealization and its implications for constitutional interpretation.

4. **Critique of Historical Figures' Views:** The text further develops its argument by critiquing the relevance of historical figures' actual views, arguing that they are inevitably flawed and thus cannot serve as a basis for constitutional interpretation.

5. **Conclusion and Summation:** The text concludes by summarizing its main points and reiterating the circularity problem inherent in the originalist position.

### 8.2 Logical Dependencies Between Claims

1. **Claim 1:** The concept of "Jefferson's values" is often used to justify originalist interpretations of the Constitution.
   - **Dependency:** This claim is a premise for the text's main argument about the circularity of the originalist position.

2. **Claim 2:** "Jefferson's values" refers to an idealization of Jefferson, not his actual views.
   - **Dependency:** This claim depends on the text's analysis of the concept of "Jefferson's values" and its distinction between the actual and idealized Jefferson.

3. **Claim 3:** This idealization is derived from a conception of constitutionality.
   - **Dependency:** This claim depends on the text's argument that the idealization of Jefferson incorporates a certain conception of constitutionality.

4. **Claim 4:** Using an idealization derived from a conception of constitutionality to justify that conception is circular.
   - **Dependency:** This claim depends on the text's logical argument about the circularity of using an idealized Jefferson to justify an originalist interpretation.

5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the originalist position is undermined by a circularity inherent in the concept of "Jefferson's values."
   - **Dependency:** The conclusion depends on all of the above claims and their logical relationships.

### 8.3 Progression from Premises to Conclusions

1. **Premise 1:** The concept of "Jefferson's values" is often used to justify originalist interpretations of the Constitution.

2. **Premise 2:** "Jefferson's values" refers to an idealization of Jefferson, not his actual views.

3. **Premise 3:** This idealization is derived from a conception of constitutionality.

4. **Premise 4:** Using an idealization derived from a conception of constitutionality to justify that conception is circular.

5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the originalist position is undermined by a circularity inherent in the concept of "Jefferson's values."

### 8.4 Use of Examples, Illustrations, or Case Studies

1. **Science Fiction Scenario:** The text uses a science fiction scenario involving going back in time to ask Jefferson about women's suffrage as an example to illustrate the problem of idealization and its implications for constitutional interpretation.

2. **Jefferson's Views on Small Government:** The text uses Jefferson's belief in small government as an example to address the objection that his values can be understood independently of constitutional interpretation.

3. **Counterfactuals About Gay Marriage:** The text uses counterfactuals about what Jefferson might have said about gay marriage as an example to support its argument that the actual views of historical figures are irrelevant to constitutional interpretation.

### 8.5 Anticipation and Response to Objections

1. **Objection 1:** Jefferson's values can be understood independently of constitutional interpretation.
   - **Response:** The text argues that this objection fails because the concept of "Jefferson's values" itself involves an idealization that presupposes a conception of constitutionality, leading to circularity.

2. **Objection 2:** The actual views of historical figures like Jefferson are relevant to constitutional interpretation.
   - **Response:** The text argues that this objection fails because the actual views of historical figures are inevitably flawed due to cultural biases and limitations, making them unreliable for constitutional interpretation.

### 8.6 Dialectical Structure

1. **Thesis:** The originalist position is undermined by a circularity inherent in the concept of "Jefferson's values."

2. **Antithesis:** Jefferson's values can be understood independently of constitutional interpretation, and the actual views of historical figures are relevant to constitutional interpretation.

3. **Synthesis:** The text synthesizes its arguments by showing that the concept of "Jefferson's values" involves an idealization derived from a conception of constitutionality, leading to circularity, and that the actual views of historical figures are irrelevant due to their inherent biases.

## SECTION 9: CRITICAL EVALUATION INDICATORS

### 9.1 Strengths of the Argument

1. **Logical Coherence:** The text's argument is logically coherent, using a clear structure of premises and conclusions to support its main thesis about the circularity of the originalist position.

2. **Conceptual Clarity:** The text provides clear conceptual analysis and distinctions, particularly in its discussion of the concept of "Jefferson's values" and the idealization of historical figures.

3. **Engagement with Objections:** The text engages dialectically with potential objections to its critique of originalism, strengthening its argument by addressing and refuting those objections.

4. **Use of Examples:** The text effectively uses examples, such as the science fiction scenario and counterfactuals about Jefferson's views, to illustrate its arguments and make them more concrete.

### 9.2 Potential Weaknesses or Gaps

1. **Overreliance on Jefferson:** The text focuses heavily on Jefferson as a case study, potentially limiting the generalizability of its arguments to other historical figures and contexts.

2. **Lack of Empirical Evidence:** The text's rejection of empirical evidence about historical figures' psychology may be seen as a weakness, as it relies solely on conceptual analysis and logical arguments.

3. **Assumption of Idealization:** The text assumes that any attempt to use historical figures' views for constitutional interpretation requires idealizing those figures, which may not be universally accepted.

### 9.3 Unstated Assumptions That Could Be Challenged

1. **Assumption 1:** Historical figures' views are inherently flawed due to cultural biases and limitations.
   - **Challenge:** This assumption could be challenged by arguing that some historical figures' views may be less influenced by cultural biases than others, or that those biases can be accounted for in constitutional interpretation.

2. **Assumption 2:** Idealization is necessary for constitutional interpretation.
   - **Challenge:** This assumption could be challenged by arguing that constitutional interpretation can be based on historical figures' actual views, without idealizing them.

3. **Assumption 3:** A priori propositions cannot ground empirical claims.
   - **Challenge:** This assumption could be challenged by arguing that a priori propositions about values can be used to support empirical claims about historical figures' psychology, particularly in the context of constitutional interpretation.

### 9.4 Alternative Interpretations or Objections Not Addressed

1. **Alternative Interpretation 1:** The concept of "Jefferson's values" can be understood as a shorthand for the values that Jefferson explicitly endorsed, rather than an idealization derived from a conception of constitutionality.
   - **Objection:** The text does not address this alternative interpretation, which could potentially undermine its argument about the circularity of the originalist position.

2. **Alternative Interpretation 2:** The originalist position can be based on the collective views of the Founding Fathers, rather than the views of individual figures like Jefferson.
   - **Objection:** The text does not address this alternative interpretation, which could potentially provide a way to avoid the circularity problem by focusing on the collective rather than the individual.

3. **Objection Not Addressed:** The text does not address the objection that the idealization of historical figures like Jefferson may be necessary for constitutional interpretation, as it allows us to focus on the enduring values and principles that those figures represent, rather than their specific views on particular issues.

### 9.5 Scope and Limitations of the Claims

1. **Scope:** The text's claims are primarily focused on the originalist school of constitutional interpretation and the use of historical figures' views, particularly Jefferson's, to justify that interpretation.

2. **Limitations:** The text's arguments may be limited in their applicability to other schools of constitutional interpretation, such as living constitutionalism, and to other historical figures and contexts beyond Jefferson and the Founding Fathers.

3. **Scope of Circularity Argument:** The text's argument about the circularity of the originalist position is limited to the specific case of using an idealized version of Jefferson's values to justify constitutional interpretations, and may not apply to other forms of originalism that do not rely on such idealizations.
