IF 
it 
is 
of 
importance 
to 
study 
by 
what 
means 
a 
nation 
may 
acquire 
wealth 
and 
power, 
it 
is 
not 
less 
so 
to 
discover 
by 
what 
means 
wealth 
and 
power, 
when 
once 
acquired, 
may 
be 
preserved. 


The 
latter 
inquiry 
is, 
perhaps, 
the 
more 
important 
of 
the 



two; 
for 
many 
nations 
have 
remained, 
during 
a 
long 
period, 
virtuous 
and 
happy, 
without 
rising 
to 
wealth 
or 
greatness; 
but 
there 
is 
no 
example 
of 
happiness 
or 
virtue 
residing 
amongst 
a 
fallen 
people. 


In 
looking 
over 
the 
globe, 
if 
we 
fix 
our 
eyes 
on 
those 
places 
where 
wealth 
formerly 
was 
accumulated, 
and 
where 
commerce 
flourished, 
we 
see 
them, 
at 
the 
present 
day, 
peculiarly 
desolated 
and 
degraded. 


From 
the 
borders 
of 
the 
Persian 
Gulf, 
to 
the 
shores 
of 
the 
Baltic 
Sea; 
from 
Babylon 
and 
Palmyra, 
Egypt, 
Greece, 
and 
Italy; 
to 
Spain 
and 
Portugal, 
and 
the 
whole 
circle 
of 
the 
Hanseatic 
League, 
we 
trace 
the 
same 
ruinous 
[end 
of 
page 
#iii] 
remains 
of 
ancient 
greatness, 
presenting 
a 
melancholy 
contrast 
with 
the 
poverty, 
indolence, 
and 
ignorance, 
of 
the 
present 
race 
of 
inhabitants, 
and 
an 
irresistible 
proof 
of 
the 
mutability 
of 
human 
affairs. 


As 
in 
the 
hall, 
in 
which 
there 
has 
been 
a 
sumptuous 
banquet, 
we 
perceive 
the 
fragments 
of 
a 
feast 
now 
become 
a 
prey 
to 
beggars 
and 
banditti; 
if, 
in 
some 
instances, 
the 
spectacle 
is 
less 
wretched 
and 
disgusting; 
it 
is, 
because 
the 
banquet 
is 
not 
entirely 
over, 
and 
the 
guests 
have 
not 
all 
yet 
risen 
from 
the 
table. 


From 
this 
almost 
universal 
picture, 
we 
learn 
that 
the 
greatness 
of 
nations 
is 
but 
of 
short 
duration. 
We 
learn, 
also, 
that 
the 
state 
of 
a 
fallen 
people 
is 
infinitely 
more 
wretched 
and 
miserable 
than 
that 
of 
those 
who 
have 
never 
risen 
from 
their 
original 
state 
of 
poverty. 
It 
is 
then 
well 
worth 
while 
to 
inquire 
into 
the 
causes 
of 
so 
terrible 
a 
reverse, 
that 
we 
may 
discover 
whether 
they 
are 
necessary, 
or 
only 
natural; 
and 
endeavour, 
if 
possible, 
to 
find 
the 
means 
by 
which 
prosperity 
may 
be 
lengthened 
out, 
and 
the 
period 
of 
humiliation 
procrastinated 
to 
a 
distant 
day. 


Though 
the 
career 
of 
prosperity 
must 
necessarily 
have 
a 
termination 
amongst 
every 
people, 
yet 
there 
is 
some 
reason 
to 
think 
that 
the 
degradation, 
which 
naturally 
follows, 
and 
which 
has 
always 
followed 
hitherto, 
may 
be 
[end 
of 
page 
#iv] 
averted; 
whether 
it 
may 
be, 



or 
may 
not 
be 
so, 
is 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
following 
Inquiry; 
which, 
if 
it 
is 
of 
importance 
to 
any 
nation 
on 
earth, 
must 
be 
peculiarly 
so 
to 
England; 
a 
nation 
that 
has 
risen, 
both 
in 
commerce 
and 
power, 
so 
high 
above 
the 
natural 
level 
assigned 
to 
it 
by 
its 
population 
and 
extent. 
A 
nation 
that 
rises 
still, 
but 
whose 
most 
earnest 
wish 
ought 
to 
be 
rather 
directed 
to 
preservation 
than 
extension; 
to 
defending 
itself 
against 
adversity 
rather 
than 
seeking 
still 
farther 
to 
augment 
its 
power. 


With 
regard 
to 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
Inquiry, 
there 
cannot 
be 
two 
opinions; 
but, 
concerning 
its 
utility 
and 
success, 
opinions 
may 
be 
divided. 


One 
of 
the 
most 
profound 
and 
ingenious 
writers 
of 
a 
late 
period, 
has 
made 
the 
following 
interesting 
observation 
on 
the 
prosperity 
of 
nations. 
{1} 


"In 
all 
speculations 
upon 
men 
and 
human 
affairs, 
it 
is 
of 
no 
small 
moment 
to 
distinguish 
things 
of 
accident 
from 
permanent 
causes, 
and 
from 
effects 
that 
cannot 
be 
altered. 
I 
am 
not 
quite 
of 
the 
mind 
of 
those 
speculators, 
who 
seem 
assured, 
that 
necessarily, 
and, 
by 
the 
constitution 
of 
things, 
all 
states 
have 
the 
same 
period 
of 
infancy, 
manhood, 
and 
decrepitude, 
that 
are 
found 
in 
the 
individuals 
who 
compose 
them. 
The 
objects 
which 
are 


{1} 
Mr 
Burke. 
-=[
end

attempted 
to 
be 
forced 
into 
an 
analogy 
are 
not 
founded 
in 
the 
same 
classes 
of 
existence. 
Individuals 
are 
physical 
beings, 
subject 
to 
laws 
universal 
and 
invariable; 
but 
commonwealths 
are 
not 
physical, 
but 
moral 
essences. 
They 
are 
artificial 
combinations, 
and, 
in 
their 
proximate 
efficient 
cause, 
the 
arbitrary 
productions 
of 
the 
human 
mind. 



We 
are 
not 
yet 
acquainted 
with 
the 
laws 
which 
necessarily 
influence 
that 
kind 
of 
work, 
made 
by 
that 
kind 
of 
agent. 
There 
is 
not, 
in 
the 
physical 
order, 
a 
distinct 
cause 
by 
which 
any 
of 
those 
fabrics 
must 
necessarily 
grow, 
flourish, 
and 
decay; 
nor, 
indeed, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
does 
the 
moral 
world 
produce 
any 
thing 
more 
determinate 
on 
that 
subject 
than 
what 
may 
serve 
as 
an 
amusement 
(liberal 
indeed, 
and 
ingenious, 
but 
still 
only 
an 
amusement) 
for 
speculative 
men. 
I 
doubt 
whether 
the 
history 
of 
mankind 
is 
yet 
complete 
enough, 
if 
ever 
it 
can 
be 
so, 
to 
furnish 
grounds 
for 
a 
sure 
theory 
on 
the 
internal 
causes, 
which 
necessarily 
affect 
the 
fortune 
of 
a 
state. 
I 
am 
far 
from 
denying 
the 
operation 
of 
such 
causes, 
but 
they 
are 
infinitely 
uncertain, 
and 
much 
more 
obscure, 
and 
much 
more 
difficult 
to 
trace 
than 
the 
foreign 
causes 
that 
tend 
to 
depress, 
and, 
sometimes, 
overwhelm 
society." 


The 
writer 
who 
has 
thus 
expressed 
his 
scepticism 
on 
this 
sort 
of 
inquiry, 
speaks, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
of 
the 
im-[end 
of 
page 
#vi] 
portance 
of 
distinguishing 
between 
accidental 
and 
permanent 
causes. 
He 
doubts 
whether 
the 
history 
of 
mankind 
is 
complete 
enough, 
or, 
if 
ever 
it 
can 
be 
so, 
to 
furnish 
grounds 
for 
a 
sure 
theory, 
on 
the 
internal 
causes 
which 
necessarily 
affect 
the 
fortune 
of 
a 
state. 
Thus, 
he 
not 
only 
admits 
the 
existence 
of 
permanent 
causes, 
but 
says, 
clearly, 
that 
it 
is 
from 
history 
they 
are 
discoverable, 
if 
ever 
their 
discovery 
can 
be 
accomplished. 
This 
is 
going 
as 
far 
as 
we 
could 
wish, 
and, 
as 
for 
the 
sure 
theory, 
we 
join 
issue 
with 
him 
in 
despairing 
of 
ever 
obtaining 
one 
that 
will 
deserve 
the 
name 
of 
sure. 


The 
meaning 
of 
the 
word, 
sure, 
in 
this 
place, 
appears 
to 
be 
intended 
in 
a 
sense 
peculiarly 
strict. 
It 
seems 
to 
imply 
a 
theory, 
that 
would 
be 
certain 
in 
its 
application 
to 
those 
vicissitudes 
and 
fluctuations 
to 
which 
nations 
are 
liable, 
and 
not 
merely 
to 
explaining 
their 
rise 
and 
decline. 
As 
to 
such 
fluctuations, 
it 
would 
be 
absurd 
to 
enter 
into 
any 
theory 
about 
them; 
they 
depend 
on 
particular 
combinations 
of 
circumstances, 
too 
infinite, 
in 
variety, 
to 
be 
imagined, 
or 
subjected 
to 
any 
general 
law, 
and 
of 
too 
momentary 
an 
operation 
to 
be 
foreseen. 


That 
Mr. 
Burke 
alludes 
to 
such 
fluctuation 
is, 
however, 
evident, 
from 
what 
that 
fanciful 
but 
deeply-read 
man 
says, 
immediately 



after: 
"We 
have 
seen 
some 
states 
which 
have 
spent 
their 
vigour 
at 
their 
commencement. 
Some 
have 
[end 
of 
page 
#vii] 
blazed 
out 
in 
their 
glory 
a 
little 
before 
their 
extinction. 
The 
meridian 
of 
some 
has 
been 
the 
most 
splendid. 
Others, 
and 
they 
the 
greatest 
number, 
have 
fluctuated, 
and 
experienced, 
at 
different 
periods 
of 
their 
existence, 
a 
great 
variety 
of 
fortune. 
The 
death 
of 
a 
man 
at 
a 
critical 
juncture, 
his 
disgust, 
his 
retreat, 
his 
disgrace, 
have 
brought 
innumerable 
calamities 
on 
a 
whole 
nation; 
a 
common 
soldier, 
a 
child, 
a 
girl, 
at 
the 
door 
of 
an 
inn, 
have 
changed 
the 
face 
of 
fortune, 
and 
almost 
of 
nature." 


From 
this 
it 
is 
abundantly 
evident, 
that 
the 
theory 
he 
wished 
for, 
but 
despaired 
of 
ever 
establishing, 
was 
one 
that 
would 
explain 
such 
effects; 
but 
the 
object 
of 
this 
Inquiry 
is 
totally 
different. 


When 
the 
Romans 
were 
in 
their 
vigour, 
their 
city 
was 
besieged 
by 
the 
Gauls, 
and 
saved 
by 
an 
animal 
of 
proverbial 
stupidity; 
but 
this 
could 
not 
have 
happened 
when 
Attila 
was 
under 
the 
walls, 
and 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
citizens 
was 
gone. 
The 
taking 
or 
saving 
the 
city, 
in 
the 
first 
instance, 
would 
have 
been 
equally 
accidental, 
and 
the 
consequences 
of 
short 
duration; 
but, 
in 
the 
latter 
days, 
the 
fall 
of 
Rome 
was 
owing 
to 
PERMANENT 
causes, 
and 
the 
effect 
has 
been 
without 
a 
remedy. 


It 
is, 
then, 
only 
concerning 
the 
permanent 
causes, 
(that 
is 
to 
say, 
causes 
that 
are 
constantly 
acting, 
and 
produce 
[end 
of 
page 
#viii] 
permanent 
effects) 
that 
we 
mean 
to 
inquire; 
and, 
even 
with 
regard 
to 
those, 
it 
is 
not 
expected 
to 
establish 
a 
theory 
that 
will 
be 
applicable, 
with 
certainty, 
to 
the 
preservation 
of 
a 
state, 
but, 
merely 
to 
establish 
one, 
which 
may 
serve 
as 
a 
safe 
guide 
on 
a 
subject, 
the 
importance 
of 
which 
is 
great, 
beyond 
calculation. 


There 
remains 
but 
one 
other 
consideration 
in 
reply 
to 
this, 
and 
that 
is, 
whether 
states 
have, 
necessarily, 
by 
the 
constitution 
and 
nature 
of 
things, 
the 
same 
periods 
of 
infancy, 
manhood, 
and 
decrepitude, 
that 
are 
found 
in 
the 
individuals 
that 
compose 
them? 
Mr. 
Burke 
thinks 
they 
have 
not; 
and, 
indeed, 
if 
they 
had, 
the 
following 
Inquiry 
would 
be 
of 
no 
sort 
of 
utility. 
It 
is 
of 
no 
importance 
to 
seek 
for 
means 
of 
preventing 
what 
must 
of 
necessity 
come 
to 
pass: 
but, 
if 
the 
word 



necessity 
is 
changed 
for 
tendency 
or 
propensity, 
then 
it 
becomes 
an 
Inquiry 
deserving 
attention, 
and, 
as 
all 
states 
have 
risen, 
flourished, 
and 
fallen, 
there 
can 
be 
no 
dispute 
with 
the 
regard 
to 
their 
tendency 
to 
do 
so. 


However 
much, 
at 
first 
sight, 
Mr. 
Burke's 
opinion 
may 
appear 
to 
militate 
against 
such 
an 
Inquiry, 
when 
duly 
considered, 
it 
will 
be 
found, 
not 
only 
to 
approve 
of 
the 
end, 
but 
to 
point 
out 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
the 
inquiry 
ought 
to 
be 
conducted; 
namely, 
by 
consulting 
history.

If 
it 
is 
allowed 
that 
any 
practical 
advantage 
is 
to 
be 
derived 
from 
the 
history 
of 
the 
past, 
it 
can 
only 
be, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
applicable 
to 
the 
present 
and 
the 
future; 
and, 
if 
there 
is 
none, 
it 
is 
melancholy 
to 
reflect 
on 
the 
volumes 
that 
have 
been 
written 
without 
farther 
utility 
than 
to 
gratify 
idle 
curiosity. 
Are 
the 
true 
lessons 
of 
history, 
because 
they 
are 
never 
completely 
applicable 
to 
present 
affairs, 
to 
be 
ranked 
with 
the 
entertaining, 
but 
almost 
useless, 
pages 
of 
romance? 
No, 
certainly. 
Of 
the 
inheritance 
possessed 
by 
the 
present 
generation, 
the 
history 
of 
those 
that 
are 
gone 
before, 
is 
not 
the 
least 
valuable 
portion. 
Each 
reader 
now 
makes 
his 
application 
in 
his 
own 
way. 
It 
is 
an 
irregular 
application, 
but 
not 
an 
useless 
one; 
and 
it 
is, 
therefore, 
hoped, 
that 
an 
Inquiry, 
founded 
on 
a 
regular 
plan 
of 
comparison 
and 
analogy, 
cannot 
but 
be 
of 
some 
utility. 


But 
why 
do 
we 
treat 
that 
as 
hypothetical, 
of 
which 
there 
can 
be 
no 
doubt? 
Wherefore 
should 
there 
be 
two 
opinions 
concerning 
the 
utility 
of 
an 
inquiry 
into 
those 
mighty 
events, 
that 
have 
removed 
wealth 
and 
commerce 
from 
the 
Euphrates 
and 
the 
Nile, 
to 
the 
Thames 
and 
the 
Texel? 
Does 
not 
the 
sun 
rise, 
and 
do 
not 
the 
seasons 
return 
to 
the 
plains 
of 
Egypt, 
and 
the 
deserts 
of 
Syria, 
the 
same 
as 
they 
did 
three 
thousand 
years 
ago? 
Is 
not 
[end 
of 
page 
#x] 
inanimate 
nature 
the 
same 
now 
that 
it 
was 
then? 
Are 
the 
principles 
of 
vegetation 
altered? 
Or 
have 
the 
subordinate 
animals 
refused 
to 
obey 
the 
will 
of 
man, 
to 
assist 
him 
in 
his 
labour, 
or 
to 
serve 
him 
for 
his 
food? 
No; 
nature 
is 
not 
less 
bountiful, 
and 
man 
has 
more 
knowledge 
and 
more 
power 
than 
at 
any 
former 
period; 
but 
it 
is 
not 
the 
man 
of 
Syria, 
or 
of 
Egypt, 
that 
has 
more 
knowledge, 
or 
more 
power. 
There 
he 
has 
suffered 
his 
race 
to 
decay, 
and, 



along 
with 
himself, 
his 
works 
have 
degenerated. 


When 
those 
countries 
were 
peopled 
with 
men, 
who 
were 
wise, 
prudent, 
industrious, 
and 
brave, 
their 
fields 
were 
fertile, 
and 
their 
cities 
magnificent; 
and 
wherever 
mankind 
have 
carried 
the 
same 
vigour, 
the 
same 
virtues, 
and 
the 
same 
character, 
nature 
has 
been 
found 
bountiful 
and 
obedient. 


Throughout 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
earth, 
we 
see 
the 
same 
causes 
producing 
nearly 
the 
same 
effects; 
why 
then 
do 
we 
remain 
in 
doubt 
respecting 
their 
connection? 
Or, 
if 
under 
no 
doubt, 
wherefore 
do 
we 
not 
endeavour 
to 
trace 
their 
operation, 
that 
we 
may 
know 
how 
to 
preserve 
those 
advantages 
we 
are 
so 
eager 
to 
obtain? 


If 
an 
Inquiry 
into 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
revolutions 
of 
nations 
is 
more 
imperfect 
and 
less 
satisfactory 
than 
when 
[end

directed 
to 
those 
of 
individuals, 
and 
of 
single 
families, 
if, 
ever 
it 
should 
be 
rendered 
complete, 
its 
application 
will, 
at 
least, 
be 
more 
certain. 
Nations 
are 
exempt 
from 
those 
accidental 
vicissitudes 
which 
derange 
the 
wisest 
of 
human 
plans 
upon 
a 
smaller 
scale. 
Number 
and 
magnitude 
reduce 
chances 
to 
certainty. 
The 
single 
and 
unforeseen 
cause 
that 
overwhelms 
a 
man 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
prosperity, 
never 
ruins 
a 
nation: 
unless 
it 
be 
ripe 
for 
ruin, 
a 
nation 
never 
falls; 
and 
when 
it 
does 
fall, 
accident 
has 
only 
the 
appearance 
of 
doing 
what, 
in 
reality, 
was 
already 
nearly 
accomplished. 


There 
is 
no 
physical 
cause 
for 
the 
decline 
of 
nations, 
nature 
remains 
the 
same; 
and 
if 
the 
physical 
man 
has 
degenerated, 
it 
was 
before 
the 
authentic 
records 
of 
history. 
The 
men 
who 
built 
the 
most 
stupendous 
pyramid 
in 
Egypt, 
did 
not 
exceed 
in 
stature 
those 
who 
now 
live 
in 
mean 
hovels 
at 
its 
immense 
base. 
If 
there 
is 
any 
country 
in 
the 
world 
that 
proves 
the 
uniformity 
of 
nature, 
it 
is 
this 
very 
Egypt. 
Unlike 
to 
other 
countries, 
that 
owe 
their 
fertility 
to 
the 
ordinary 
succession 
of 
seasons, 
of 
which 
regular 
registers 
do 
not 
exist, 
and 
are 
never 
accurate, 
it 
depends 
on 
the 
overflowing 
of 
the 
waters 
of 
a 
single 
river. 
The 
marks 
that 
indicated 
the 
rising 
of 
the 
Nile, 
in 
the 
days 
of 
the 
Pharaos, 
and 
of 
the 
Ptolemies, 
do 
the 
same 
[end 
of 
page 
#xii] 
at 
the 
present 
day, 
and 
are 



a 
guarantee 
for 
the 
future 
regularity 
of 
nature, 
by 
the 
undeniable 
certainty 
of 
it 
for 
the 
past. 


By 
a 
singular 
propensity 
for 
preserving 
the 
bodies 
of 
the 
dead, 
the 
Egyptians 
have 
left 
records 
equally 
authentic, 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
human 
frame. 
{2} 
Here 
nothing 
is 
fabulous; 
and 
even 
the 
unintentional 
errors 
of 
language 
are 
impossible. 
We 
have 
neither 
to 
depend 
on 
the 
veracity 
nor 
the 
correctness 
of 
man. 
The 
proofs 
exhibited 
are 
visible 
and 
tangible; 
they 
are 
the 
object 
of 
the 
senses, 
and 
admit 
of 
no 
mistake. 


But 
while 
that 
country 
exhibits 
the 
most 
authentic 
proofs 
of 
the 
uniform 
course 
of 
nature, 
it 
affords 
also 
the 
most 
evident 
examples 
of 
the 
degradation 
of 
the 
human 
mind. 
It 
is 
there 
we 
find 
the 
cause 
of 
those 
ruins 
that 
astonish, 
and 
the 
desolation 
that 
afflicts. 
Had 
men 
continued 
their 
exertions, 
the 
labour 
of 
their 
hands 
would 
not 
have 
fallen 
to 
decay. 


It 
is 
in 
the 
exertion 
and 
conduct 
of 
man, 
and 
in 
the 
information 
of 
his 
mind, 
that 
we 
find 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
mutability 
of 
human 
affairs. 
We 
are 
about 
to 
trace

Most 
part 
of 
the 
mummies 
found 
in 
Egypt, 
instead 
of 
being 
of 
a 
larger 
size, 
are 
considerably 
under 
the 
middle 
stature 
of 
the 
people 
of 
England. 
Those 
dead 
monuments 
of 
the 
human 
frame 
give 
the 
direct 
lie 
to 
Homer 
and 
all 
the 
traditions 
about 
men's 
degenerating 
in 
size 
and 
strength.

them 
through 
an 
intricate 
labyrinth; 
but, 
in 
this, 
we 
are 
not 
without 
a 
guide. 


The 
history 
of 
three 
thousand 
years, 
and 
of 
nations 
that 



have 
risen 
to 
wealth 
and 
power, 
in 
a 
great 
variety 
of 
situations, 
all 
terminating 
with 
a 
considerable 
degree 
of 
similarity, 
discovers 
the 
great 
outline 
of 
the 
causes 
that 
invigorate 
or 
degrade 
the 
human 
mind, 
and 
thereby 
raise 
or 
ruin 
states 
and 
empires. 
{3}

The 
utility 
of 
this 
Inquiry 
is 
considerably 
strengthened 
by 
the 
opinion 
of 
a 
writer 
of 
great 
information 
and 
first-rate 
abilities. 
{*} 
An 
historical 
review 
of 
different 
forms 
under 
which 
human 
affairs 
have 
appeared 
in 
different 
ages 
and 
nations 
naturally 
suggests 
the 
question, 
whether 
the 
experience 
of 
former 
times 
may 
not 
now 
furnish 
some 
general 
principles 
to 
enlighten 
and 
direct 
the 
policy 
of 
future 
legislators? 
The 
discussion, 
however, 
to 
which 
the 
question 
leads 
is 
of 
singular 
difficulty; 
as 
it 
requires 
an 
accurate 
analysis 
of 
by 
far 
the 
most 
complicated 
class 
of 
phenomena 
that 
can 
possibly 
engage 
our 
attention; 
those 
which 
result 
from 
the 
intricate 
and 
often 
from 
the 
imperceptible 
mechanism 
of 
political 
society 
--a 
subject 
of 
observation 
which 
seems 
at 
first 
view 
so 
little 
commensurate 
to 
our 
faculties, 
that 
it 
has 
been 
generally 
regarded 
with 
the 
same 
passive 
emotions 
of 
wonder 
and 
submission 
with 
which, 
in 
the 
material 
world, 
we 
survey 
the 
effects 
produced 
by 
the 
mysterious 
and 
uncontroulable 
operation 
of 
phisical 
=sic= 
causes. 
It 
is 
fortunate 
that 
upon 
this, 
as 
on 
many 
other 
occasions, 
the 
difficulties 
which 
had 
long 
baffled 
the 
effort 
of 
solitary 
genius 
begin 
to 
appear 
less 
formidable 
to 
the 
united 
exertions 
of 
the 
race; 
and 
that, 
in 
proportion 
as 
the 
experience 
and 
the 
reasonings 
of 
different 
individuals 
are 
brought 
to 
bear 
on 
the 
objects, 
and 
are 
combined 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
as 
to 
illustrate 
and 
to 
limit 
each 
other, 
the 
science 
of 
politics 
assumes 
more 
and 
more 
that 
systematical 
form 
which 
encourages 
and 
aids 
the 
labours 
of 
future 
inquirers.

IN 
the 
following 
Inquiry 
I 
have 
inserted 
four 
engraved 
Charts, 
in 
order 
to 
illustrate 
the 
subjects 
treated 
of 
in 
the 
Book, 
by 
a 
method 
approved 
of 
both 
in 
this 
and 
in 
other 
countries. 
{4} 


The 
Chart, 
No. 
1, 
representing 
the 
rise 
and 
fall 
of 
all 
nations 
or 
countries, 
that 
have 
been 
particularly 
distinguished 
for 
wealth 
or 
power, 
is 
the 
first 
of 
the 
sort 
that 
ever 
was 
engraved, 
and 
has, 
therefore, 
not 
yet 
met 
with 
public 
approbation. 


It 
is 
constructed 
to 
give 
a 
distinct 
view 
of 
the 
migrations 
of 
commerce 
and 
of 
wealth 
in 
general. 
For 
a 
very 
accurate 
view, 
there 
are 
no 
materials 
in 
existence; 
neither 
would 
it 
lead 
to 
any 
very 
different 
conclusion, 
if 
the 
proportional 
values 
were 
ascertained 
with 
the 
greatest 
accuracy. 


I 
first 
drew 
the 
Chart 
in 
order 
to 
clear 
up 
my 
own 
ideas 
on 
the 
subject, 
finding 
it 
very 
troublesome 
to 
retain 
a 
distinct 
notion 
of 
the 
changes 
that 
had 
taken 
place. 
I 
found 
it 
answer 
the 
purpose 
beyond 
my 
expectation, 
by 
bringing 
into 
one 
view 
the 
result 
of 
details 
that 
are 
dispersed 
over 
a 
very 
wide 
and 
intricate 
field 
of 
universal 
history; 
facts 
sometimes 
connected 
with 
each 
other, 
sometimes 
not, 
and 
always 
requiring 
reflection 
each 
time 
they 
were 
referred 
to. 
I 
found 
the 
first 
rough 
draft 
give 
=sic= 
me 
a 
better 


{4} 
The 
Charts, 
Nos. 
3 
and 
4, 
were 
copied 
in 
Paris, 
before 
the 
revolution, 
and 
highly 
approved 
of 
by 
the 
Academy 
of 
Sciences. 
No. 
2, 

though 
of 
late 
invention, 
has 
been 
copied 
in 
France 
and 
Germany. 
Of 
No. 
1, 
the 
public 
has 
yet 
to 
judge, 
and, 
perhaps, 
it 
will 
treat 
me 
with 
indulgence 
and 
good 
nature, 
as 
on 
former 
occasions.

comprehension 
of 
the 
subject, 
than 
all 
that 
I 
had 
learnt 
from 
occasional 
reading, 
for 
half 
of 
my 
lifetime; 
and, 
on 
the 
supposition 
that 
what 
was 
of 
so 
much 
use 
to 
me, 
might 
be 
of 
some 
to 
others, 
I 
have 
given 
it 
with 
a 
tolerable 
degree 
of 
accuracy. 


No. 
2, 
relates 
entirely 
to 
the 
present 
state 
of 
nations 
in 
Europe, 
and 
the 
extent, 
revenue, 
and 
population, 
as 
represented, 
are 
taken 
from 
the 
most 
accurate 
documents. 
Where 
statistical 
writers 
differed, 
I 
followed 
him 
who 
appeared 
to 
me 
the 
most 
likely 
to 
be 
right. 


Nos. 
3 
and 
4, 
relate 
entirely 
to 
England, 
and 
are 
drawn 
from 
the 
most 
accurate 
documents. 


Opposite 
to 
each 
Chart 
are 
descriptions 
and 
explanations. 


The 
reader 
will 
find, 
five 
minutes 
attention 
to 
the 
principle 
on 
which 
they 
are 
constructed, 
a 
saving 
of 
much 
labour 
and 
time; 
but, 
without 
that 
trifling 
attention, 
he 
may 
as 
well 
look 
at 
a 
blank 
sheet 
of 
paper 
as 
at 
one 
of 
the 
Charts. 


I 
know 
of 
nothing 
else, 
in 
the 
Book, 
that 
requires 
previous 
explanation. 


I 
think 
it 
well 
to 
embrace 
this 
opportunity, 
the 
best 
I 
have 
had, 
and, 
perhaps, 
the 
last 
I 
ever 
shall 
have, 
of 
making 
some 
return, 
(as 
far 
as 
acknowledgement 
is 
a 
return,) 
for 
an 
obligation, 
of 
a 
nature 
never 
to 
be 
repaid, 
by 
acknowledging 
publicly, 
that, 
to 
the 
best 
and 
most 



affectionate 
of 
brothers, 
I 
owe 
the 
invention 
of 
those 
Charts. 


At 
a 
very 
early 
period 
of 
my 
life, 
my 
brother, 
who, 
in 
a 
most 
examplary 
manner, 
maintained 
and 
educated 
the 
family 
his 
father 
left, 
made 
me 
keep 
a 
register 
of 
a 
thermometer, 
expressing 
the 
variations 
by 
lines 
on 
a 
divided 
scale. 
He 
taught 
me 
to 
know, 
that, 
whatever 
can 
be 
expressed 
in 
numbers, 
may 
be 
represented 
by 
lines. 
The 
Chart 
of 
the 
thermometer 
was 
on 
the 
same 
principle 
with 
those 
given 
here; 
the 
application 
only 
is 
different. 
The 
brother 
to 
whom 
I 
owe 
this, 
now 
fills 
the 
Natural 
Philosophy 
Chair 
in 
the 
University 
of 
Edinburgh.

Wealthy 
and 
Powerful

ONE 
of 
the 
most 
solid 
foundations 
on 
which 
an 
enquirer 
can 
proceed 
in 
matters 
of 
political 
economy, 
as 
connected 
with 
the 
fate 
of 
nations, 
seems 
to 
be 
by 
an 
appeal 
to 
history, 
a 
view 
of 
the 
effects 
that 
have 
been 
produced, 
and 
an 
investigation 
of 
the 
causes 
that 
have 
operated 
in 
producing 
them. 


Unfortunately, 
in 
this 
case, 
the 
materials 
are 
but 
very 
scanty, 
and 
sometimes 
rather 
of 
doubtful 
authority; 
nevertheless, 
such 
as 
they 
are, 
I 
do 
not 
think 
it 
well 
to 
reject 
the 
use 
of 
them, 
and 
have, 
therefore, 
begun, 
by 
taking 
a 
view 
of 
the 
causes 
that 
have 
ruined 
nations 
that 
have 
been 
great 
and 
wealthy, 
beginning 
with 
the 
earliest 
records 
and 
coming 
down 
to 
the 
present 
time.

Dr. 
Robertson 
very 
truly 
says, 
"It 
is 
a 
cruel 
mortification, 
in 
searching 
for 
what 
is 
instructive 
in 
the 
history 
of 
past 
times, 
to 
find 
that 
the 
exploits 
of 
conquerors 
who 
have 
desolated 
the 
earth, 
and 
the 
freaks 
of 
tyrants 
who 
have 
rendered 
nations 
unhappy, 
are 
recorded 
with 
minute, 
and 
often 
disgusting 
accuracy, 
while 
the 
discovery 
of 
useful 
arts, 
and 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
most 
beneficial 
branches 
of 
commerce 
are 
passed 
over 
in 
silence, 
and 
suffered 
to 
sink 
in 
oblivion."

I 
divide 
this 
space 
into 
three 
periods, 
because 
in 
each 
is 
to 
be 
seen 
a 
very 
distinct 
feature. 


During 
the 
first 
period, 
previous 
to 
the 
fall 
of 
the 
Roman 
empire, 
the 
order 
of 
things 
was 
such 
as 
had 
arisen 
from 
the 
new 
state 
of 
mankind, 
who 
had 
gradually 
increased 
in 
numbers, 
and 
improved 
in 
sciences 
and 
arts. 
The 
different 
degrees 
of 
wealth 
were 
owing, 
at 
first, 
to 
local 
situation, 
natural 
advantages, 
and 
priority 
in 
point 
of 
settlement, 
till 
the 
causes 
of 
decline 
begun 
to 
operate 
on 
some; 
when 
the 
adventitious 
causes 
of 
wealth 
and 
power, 
producing 
conquest, 
began 
to 
establish 
a 
new 
order 
of 
things. 


The 
second 
period, 
from 
the 
fall 
of 
the 
Roman 
government 
till 
the 
discovery 
of 
America, 
and 
the 
passage 
to 
the 
East 
Indies, 
by 
the 
ocean, 
has 
likewise 
a 
distinct 
feature, 
and 
is 
treated 
of 
by 
itself. 


The 
rulers 
of 
mankind 
were 
not 
then 
men, 
who 
from 
the 
ease 
and 
leisure 
of 
pastoral 
life, 
under 
a 
mild 
heaven, 
had 
studied 
science, 
and 
cultivated 
the 
arts; 
they 
were 
men 
who 
had 
descended 
from 
a 
cold 
northern 
climate, 
where 
nature 
did 
little 
to 
supply 
their 
wants, 
where 
hunger 
and 
cold 
could 
not 
be 
avoided 
but 
by 
industry 
and 
exertion; 
where, 
in 
one 
word, 
the 
sterility 
of 
nature 
was 
counteracted 
by 
the 
energy 
of 
man. 



The 
possessors 
of 
milder 
climates, 
and 
of 
softer 
manners, 
falling 
under 
the 
dominion 
of 
such 
men, 
inferior 
greatly 
in 
numbers, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
arts, 
intermixed 
with 
them, 
and 
formed 
a 
new 
race, 
of 
which 
the 
character 
was 
different; 
and 
it 
is 
a 
circumstance 
not 
a 
little 
curious, 
that 
while 
mankind 
were 
in 
a 
state 
at 
which 
they 
had 
arrived 
by 
increasing 
population, 
and 
by 
the 
arts 
of 
peace, 
slavery 
was 
universal: 
but 
that 
when 
governed 
by 
men 
who 
were 
conquerors, 
and 
owed 
their 
superiority 
to 
force 
alone, 
where 
slavery 
might 
have 
been 
expected 
to 
originate, 
it 
was 
abolished. 
{6} 


{6} 
This 
fact, 
which 
is 
indisputable, 
has, 
at 
first 
sight, 
a 
most 
extraordinary 
appearance, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
seems 
difficult 
to 
account 
for; 
but 
a 
little 
examination 
into 
circumstances 
will 
render 
it 
easily 
understood. 
In 
warm 
and 
fertile 
countries, 
the 
love 
of 
ease 
is 
predominant, 
and 
the 
services 
wanted 
are 
such 
as 
a 
slave 
can 
perform. 
The 
indolent 
habits 
of 
people 
make 
them 
consider 
freedom 
as 
an 
object 
of 
less 
importance 
than 
exemption 
from 
care. 
While 
the 
rulers 
of 
mankind 
were 
indolent 
and 
luxurious, 
they 
were 
interested 
in 
continuing 
slavery, 
which 
must 
have 
[end 
of 
page 
#2] 
originated 
in 
barbarism 
and 
ignorance. 
But 
the 
northern 
nations 
were 
different; 
with 
them, 
neither 
the 
moral 
character, 
the 
physical 
powers, 
or 
the 
situation 
of 
things, 
favoured 
slavery. 
The 
services 
one 
man 
wanted 
of 
another 
were 
not 
such 
as 
a 
slave 
could 
be 
forced 
to 
perform: 
neither 
are 
men 
who 
are 
fitted 
for 
performing 
such 
offices 
disposed 
to 
submit 
to 
slavery. 
Shepherds 
may 
be 
reduced 
to 
the 
situation 
of 
slaves, 
but 
hunters 
will 
not 
be 
likely 
to 
submit 
to 
such 
a 
situation, 
even 
if 
their 
occupation 
admitted 
of 
it. 
Slaves 
can 
only 
be 
employed 
to 
perform 
labour 
that 
is 
under 
the 
eye 
of 
an 
overseer 
or 
master, 
or 
the 
produce 
of 
which 
is 
nearly 
certain: 
but 
the 
labour 
of 
a 
hunter 
is 
neither 
the 
one 
nor 
the 
other, 
it 
is, 
therefore, 
not 
of 
the 
sort 
to 
be 
performed 
by 
slaves. 
The 
athletic 
active 
life 
necessary 
for 
a 
hunter 
is, 
besides, 
unfriendly 
to 
slavery, 
if 
not 
totally 
at 
variance 
with 
it. 
What 
does 
a 
slave 
receive 
in 
return 
for 
his 
service? 
Lodging, 
nourishment, 
and 
a 
life 
free 
from 
care. 
A 
hunter 
is 
obliged 
to 
provide 
the 



two 
former 
for 
himself, 
and 
the 
latter 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
him 
to 
enjoy. 
The 
same 
thing 
goes 
even 
to 
hired 
servants. 
In 
the 
rudest 
state 
of 
shepherds, 
there 
are 
hired 
servants, 
but 
men 
in 
a 
rude 
state 
never 
hunt 
for 
wages: 
they 
are 
their 
own 
masters: 
they 
may 
hunt 
in 
society 
or 
partnership, 
but 
never 
as 
slaves 
or 
hired 
servants. 


-=


The 
progress 
towards 
wealth 
in 
this 
new 
state 
of 
things 
was 
very 
slow, 
but 
the 
equality 
that 
prevailed 
amongst 
feudal 
barons, 
their 
love 
of 
war 
and 
glory, 
and 
the 
leisure 
they 
enjoyed, 
by 
degrees 
extended 
the 
limits 
of 
commerce 
very 
widely, 
as 
the 
northern 
world 
never 
could 
produce 
many 
articles 
which 
its 
inhabitants 
had 
by 
their 
connection 
with 
the 
south 
learnt 
to 
relish 
and 
enjoy. 


The 
intermediate 
countries, 
that 
naturally 
formed 
a 
link 
of 
connection 
between 
the 
ancient 
nations 
of 
the 
east 
and 
the 
rough 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
north, 
profited 
the 
most 
by 
this 
circumstance; 
and 
we 
still 
find 
the 
borders 
of 
the 
Mediterranean 
Sea, 
though 
no 
longer 
the 
seat 
of 
power, 
the 
places 
where 
wealth 
was 
chiefly 
concentrated. 


The 
impossibility 
of 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
northern 
countries 
transporting 
their 
rude 
and 
heavy 
produce, 
in 
order 
to 
exchange 
it 
for 
the 
luxuries 
of 
the 
south, 
gave 
rise 
to 
manufactures 
as 
well 
as 
fishing 
on 
the 
southern 
confines 
of 
the 
Baltic 
Sea; 
from 
whence 
arose 
the 
wealth 
of 
Flanders, 
Holland, 
and 
the 
Hans 
Towns. 
This 
forms 
an 
epoch 
entirely 
new 
in 
its 
nature 
and 
description, 
and 
its 
termination 
was 
only 
brought 
on 
by 
the 
great 
discovery 
of 
the 
passage 
to 
Asia, 
by 
the 
Cape 
of 
Good 
Hope, 
and 
to 
America, 
by 
sailing 
straight 
out 
into 
the 
Atlantic 
Ocean. 


The 
nations 
that 
had 
till 
those 
discoveries 
been 
the 
best 
situated 
for 
[end

commerce 
no 
longer 
enjoyed 
that 
advantage; 
by 
that 
means 
it 
changed 
its 
abode; 
but 
not 
only 
did 
it 
change 
its 
abode, 
it 
changed 
its 
nature, 
and 
the 
trifling 
commerce 
that 
had 
hitherto 
been 
carried 
on 
by 
the 
intervention 
of 
caravans 
by 
land, 
or 
of 
little 
barks 
coasting 
on 
the 
borders 
of 
the 
Mediterranean 
Sea, 
(never 



venturing, 
without 
imminent 
danger, 
to 
lose 
sight 
of 
the 
shore,) 
{7} 
was 
dropt 
for 
that 
bold 
and 
adventurous 
navigation, 
connecting 
the 
most 
distant 
parts 
of 
the 
world; 
between 
which 
since 
then 
large 
vessels 
pass 
with 
greater 
expedition 
and 
safety 
than 
they 
formerly 
did 
between 
the 
Grecian 
Islands, 
or 
from 
Italy 
to 
Africa. 


Three 
inventions, 
two 
in 
commerce 
and 
the 
other 
in 
war, 
nearly 
of 
equal 
antiquity, 
formed 
this 
into 
one 
of 
these 
epochs 
that 
gives 
a 
new 
feature 
to 
things. 


The 
discovery 
of 
the 
magnetic 
power 
of 
the 
needle 
improved 
and 
totally 
altered 
navigation. 
The 
art 
of 
printing 
gave 
the 
means 
of 
extending 
with 
facility, 
to 
mankind 
at 
large, 
the 
mode 
of 
communicating 
thoughts 
and 
ideas, 
which 
had 
till 
then 
been 
attended 
with 
great 
difficulty, 
and 
confined 
to 
a 
few. 
This 
placed 
men 
nearer 
upon 
an 
equality 
with 
respect 
to 
mind, 
and 
greatly 
facilitated 
commerce 
and 
the 
arts. 
The 
invention 
of 
gun-powder 
nearly 
at 
the 
same 
time 
changed 
the 
art 
of 
war, 
not 
only 
in 
its 
manner, 
but 
in 
its 
effect, 
a 
point 
of 
far 
greater 
importance. 
While 
human 
force 
was 
the 
power 
by 
which 
men 
were 
annoyed, 
in 
cases 
of 
hostility, 
bodily 
strength 
laid 
the 
foundation 
for 
the 
greatness 
of 
individual 
men, 
as 
well 
as 
of 
whole 
nations. 
So 
long 
as 
this 
was 
the 
case, 
it 
was 
impossible 
for 
any 
nation 
to 
cultivate 
the 
arts 
of 
peace, 
(as 
at 
the 
present 
time), 
without 
becoming 
much 
inferior 
in 
physical 
force 
to 
nations 
that 
preferred 
hunting 
or 
made 
war 
their 
study; 
or 
to 
such 
as 
preferred 
exercising 
the 
body, 
as 
rude 
nations 
do, 
to 
gratifying 
the 
appetites, 
as 
practised 
in 
wealthy 
ones. 
To 
be 
wealthy 
and 
powerful 
long 
together 
was 
then 
impossible. 


Since 
this 
last 
invention, 
the 
physical 
powers 
of 
men 
have 
ceased 
to 
occupy 
any 
material 
part 
in 
their 
history; 
superiority 
in 
skill 
is 
now 
the 
great 
object 
of 
the 
attainment 
of 
those 
who 
wish 
to 
excel, 
{8} 
and 


{7} 
It 
was 
forbidden 
by 
law, 
formerly, 
in 
Spain, 
to 
put 
to 
sea 
from 
the 
11th 
of 
November 
to 
the 
10th 
of 
March.

In 
the 
divine 
poem 
of 
the 
Iliad, 
Nestor, 
for 
experience 
and 
wisdom, 
and 
Ulysses, 
for 
[end 
of 
page 
#4] 
cunning, 
are 
the 
only 
two 
heroes 
whose 
minds 
gave 
them 
a 
superiority; 
but 
they 
make 
no 
figure 
compared 
to 
Achilles 
and 
Hector, 
or 
even 
the 
strong, 
rough, 
and 
ignorant 
Ajax. 
To 
bear 
fatigue, 
and 
understand 
discipline, 
is 
the 
great 
object 
at 
present; 
for 
though, 
of 
late 
years, 
the 
increased 
use 
of 
the 
bayonet 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
slight 
approximation 
to 
the 
ancient 
mode 
of 
contending 
by 
bodily 
strength, 
it 
is 
to 
be 
considered, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
that 
artillery 
is 
more 
than 
ever 
employed, 
which 
is 
increasing 
the 
dissimilarity. 
Again, 
though 
the 
bayonet 
is 
used, 
it 
is 
under 
circumstances 
quite 
new. 
Great 
strength 
enabled 
a 
single 
man, 
by 
wearing 
very 
thick 
armour, 
and 
wielding 
a 
longer 
sword 
or 
spear, 
to 
be 
invulnerable 
to 
men 
of 
lesser 
force, 
while 
he 
could 
perform 
what 
feats 
he 
pleased 
in 
defeating 
them. 
As 
gun-powder 
has 
destroyed 
the 
use 
of 
heavy 
armour, 
though 
with 
the 
sabre 
and 
bayonet 
men 
are 
not 
equal, 
they 
are 
all 
much 
more 
nearly 
so. 
No 
one 
is 
invulnerable, 
even 
in 
single 
combat, 
with 
the 
arme 
blanche, 
and 
with 
fire 
arms 
they 
are 
nearly 
on 
an 
equality. 
The 
changes 
that 
this 
makes, 
through 
every 
department 
of 
life, 
are 
too 
numerous 
to 
be 
enlarged 
upon, 
or 
not 
to 
be 
visible 
to 
all. 
-=


men 
may 
devote 
themselves 
to 
a 
life 
of 
ease 
and 
enjoyment 
without 
falling 
under 
a 
real 
inferiority, 
provided 
they 
do 
not 
allow 
the 
mind 
to 
be 
degraded 
or 
sunk 
in 
sloth, 
ignorance, 
or 
vice. 


Those 
discoveries, 
then, 
by 
altering 
the 
physical 
powers 
of 
men, 
by 
changing 
their 
relations 
and 
connections, 
as 
well 
as 
by 
opening 
new 
fields 
for 
commerce, 
and 
new 
channels 
for 
carrying 
it 
on, 
form 
a 
very 
distinct 
epoch 
in 
the 
history 
of 
wealth 
and 
power, 
and 
alter 
greatly 
their 
nature 
in 
the 
detail; 
though, 
in 
the 
main 
outline 
and 
abstract 
definition, 
they 
are 
still 
the 
same; 
having 
always 
the 
same 
relation 
to 
each 
other, 
or 
to 
the 
state 
of 
things 
at 
the 
time. 


This 
last 
period 
is 
then 
very 
different 
in 
its 
nature, 
and 
much 
more 
important 
than 
either 
of 
the 
others 
that 
preceded 
it; 
yet, 
in 



one 
thing, 
there 
is 
a 
similarity 
that 
runs 
through 
the 
whole, 
and 
it 
is 
a 
very 
important 
one. 


The 
passions 
and 
propensities 
of 
mankind, 
though 
they 
have 
changed 
their 
objects, 
and 
the 
means 
of 
their 
gratification, 
have 
not 
changed 
their 
nature. 
The 
desire 
of 
enjoyment; 
and 
of 
enjoyment 
with 
the 
least 
trouble 
possible, 
appears 
to 
be 
the 
basis 
of 
all 
the 
passions. 
Hence, 
envy, 
jealousy, 
friendship, 
and 
the 
endless 
train 
of 
second-rate 
effects, 
appear 
all 
to 
be 
produced 
by 
that 
primary 
passion; 
{9} 
and 
as 
from 


{9} 
The 
very 
learned 
and 
ingenious 
author 
of 
the 
Inquiry 
into 
the 
Origin 
and 
Causes 
of 
the 
Wealth 
of 
Nations, 
traces 
all 
this 
to 
an 
innate 
propensity 
to 
barter. 
But 
barter 
is 
only 
a 
means, 
and 
not 
even 
the 
means 
to 
which 
mankind 
shew 
the 
greatest 
pro-[end 
of 
page 
#5] 
pensity; 
for, 
wherever 
they 
have 
power 
to 
take 
by 
force 
or 
pillage, 
they 
never 
barter. 
This 
is 
seen 
both 
in 
an 
infantine 
and 
adult 
state; 
children 
cry 
for 
toys, 
and 
stretch 
at 
them 
before 
they 
offer 
to 
exchange; 
and, 
conquerors 
or 
soldiers 
never 
buy 
or 
barter, 
when 
they 
can 
take, 
unless 
they 
are 
guided 
by 
some 
other 
motive 
than 
mere 
natural 
propensity. 
A 
highwayman 
will 
pay 
for 
his 
dinner 
at 
an 
inn, 
as 
willingly 
as 
a 
traveller, 
because 
he 
acts 
from 
other 
motives 
than 
propensity, 
but 
he 
will 
strip 
the 
inn-keeper 
when 
he 
meets 
him 
on 
the 
road. 
-=


this 
originate 
the 
wealth 
as 
well 
as 
the 
decline 
of 
nations, 
the 
history 
of 
the 
revolutions 
in 
wealth 
and 
power, 
during 
the 
two 
first 
periods, 
are 
by 
no 
means 
unimportant; 
besides, 
as 
their 
duration 
was 
much 
longer 
than 
that 
of 
the 
latter, 
they 
lead 
to 
a 
more 
certain 
conclusion. 


The 
review 
of 
what 
has 
taken 
place 
will 
occupy 
the 
first 
book; 
and 
serve 
as 
a 
data 
for 
an 
inquiry 
into 
the 
nature 
and 
causes 
of 
the 
fall 
of 
nations. 



The 
first 
part 
of 
the 
second 
book 
will 
be 
dedicated 
to 
investigating 
the 
internal 
causes 
of 
decline; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
all 
those 
causes 
which 
arise 
from 
the 
possession 
of 
wealth 
and 
power, 
operating 
on 
the 
habits, 
manners, 
and 
minds 
of 
the 
inhabitants; 
as 
also 
on 
the 
political 
arrangements, 
laws, 
government, 
and 
institutions, 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
connected 
with 
the 
prosperity 
or 
decline 
of 
nations. 


The 
latter 
part 
of 
the 
same 
book 
will 
treat 
of 
the 
exterior 
causes 
of 
decline, 
arising 
from 
the 
envy 
of 
other 
nations; 
their 
advancement 
in 
the 
same 
arts 
to 
which 
the 
nations 
that 
are 
rich 
owe 
their 
wealth, 
or 
their 
excelling 
them 
in 
other 
arts, 
by 
which 
they 
can 
be 
rivalled, 
reduced, 
or 
subdued. 


After 
having 
inquired 
into 
external 
and 
internal 
causes; 
and 
the 
operation 
of 
each 
and 
of 
both, 
(though 
they 
never 
act 
quite 
separately,) 
accidental 
causes, 
will 
make 
an 
object 
for 
consideration, 
which 
will 
bring 
the 
general 
inquiry 
to 
a 
conclusion. 


The 
third 
book 
will 
begin 
with 
an 
application 
of 
the 
information 
obtained 
to 
the 
present 
state 
of 
England: 
by 
comparing 
its 
situation 
with 
that 
of 
nations 
that 
were 
great; 
and, 
by 
endeavouring 
to 
point 
out 
a 
means 
by 
which 
its 
decline 
may 
be 
prevented. 


Though 
we 
know 
that, 
in 
this 
world, 
nothing 
is 
eternal, 
particularly 
in 
the 
institutions 
of 
man; 
yet, 
by 
a 
sort 
of 
fiction 
in 
language, 
when 
the 
final 
term 
is 
not 
fixed, 
and 
the 
end 
desirable, 
what 
is 
known 
to 
be 
[end 
of 
page 
#6] 
temporary 
is 
considered 
as 
perpetual. 
Thus, 
the 
contract 
between 
the 
king 
and 
the 
people, 
the 
constituent 
laws 
of 
a 
country, 
&c. 
are 
considered 
as 
permanent 
and 
of 
eternal 
duration. 


In 
this 
case, 
though 
the 
final 
decline 
of 
a 
nation 
cannot 
be 
prevented; 
though 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
will 
either, 
by 
that 
regular 
chain 
of 
causes 
which 
admits 
of 
being 
traced, 
or 
by 
their 
regular 
operation 
of 
coincident 
causes 
which 
is 
termed 
accidental, 
sooner 
or 
later 
put 
an 
end 
to 
the 
prosperity 
of 
every 
nation, 
yet 
we 
shall 
not 
speak 
of 
prolonging 
prosperity, 
but 
of 
preventing 
decline, 
just 
as 
if 
it 
were 
never 
to 
happen 
at 
any 
period. 



Before 
entering 
upon 
this 
Inquiry, 
it 
may 
be 
well, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
being 
explicitly 
understood, 
to 
define 
what 
I 
mean 
by 
wealthy 
and 
powerful 
nations. 


In 
speaking 
of 
nations, 
wealth 
and 
power 
are 
sometimes 
related 
to 
each 
other, 
as 
cause 
and 
effect. 
Sometimes 
there 
is 
between 
a 
mutual 
action 
and 
re-action. 
In 
the 
natural 
or 
ordinary 
course 
of 
things, 
they 
are, 
at 
first, 
intimately 
connected 
and 
dependent 
on 
each 
other, 
till, 
at 
last, 
this 
connection 
lessening 
by 
degrees, 
and 
they 
even 
act 
in 
opposite 
directions; 
when 
wealth 
undermines 
and 
destroys 
power, 
but 
power 
never 
destroys 
wealth. 
{10} 


Though 
wealth 
and 
power 
are 
often 
found 
united, 
they 
are 
sometimes 
found 
separated. 
Wealth 
is 
altogether 
a 
real 
possession; 
power 
is 
comparative. 
Thus, 
a 
nation 
may 
be 
wealthy 
in 
itself, 
though 
unconnected 
with 
any 
other 
nation; 
but 
its 
power 
can 
only 
be 
estimated 
by 
a 
comparison 
with 
that 
of 
other 
nations. 


Wealth 
consists 
in 
having 
abundance 
of 
whatever 
mankind 
want 
or 
desire; 
and 
if 
there 
were 
but 
one 
nation 
on 
earth, 
it 
might 
be 
wealthy; 
but 
it 
would, 
in 
that 
case, 
be 
impossible 
to 
measure 
its 
power. 


Wealth 
is, 
however, 
not 
altogether 
real; 
it 
is 
in 
a 
certain 
degree 
comparative, 
whereas 
power 
is 
altogether 
comparative. 


The 
Romans, 
for 
example, 
may 
very 
justly 
be 
called 
the 
most 


{10} 
Till 
a 
nation 
has 
risen 
above 
its 
neighbours, 
and 
those 
to 
whom 
it 
compares 
itself, 
wealth 
and 
power 
act 
in 
the 
same 
direction; 
but, 
after 
it 
has 
got 
beyond 
that 
point, 
they 
begin 
to 
counteract 
each 
other.

powerful 
nation 
that 
ever 
existed, 
yet 
a 
single 
battalion 
of 
our 
present 
troops, 
well 
supported 
with 
artillery, 
would 
have 
probably 
destroyed 
the 
finest 
army 
they 
ever 
sent 
into 
the 
field. 
A 
single 
ship 
of 
the 
line 
would 
certainly 
have 
sunk, 
taken, 
or 
put 
to 
flight, 
all 
the 
fleets 
that 
Rome 
and 
Carthage 
ever 
sent 
to 
sea. 
The 
feeblest 
and 
least 
powerful 
of 
civilized 
nations, 
with 
the 
present 
means 
of 
fighting, 
and 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
present 
day, 
would 
defeat 
an 
ancient 
army 
of 
the 
most 
powerful 
description. 
Power 
then 
is 
entirely 
relative; 
and 
what 
is 
feebleness 
now, 
would, 
at 
a 
certain 
time, 
have 
been 
force 
or 
power. 


It 
is 
not 
altogether 
so 
with 
wealth, 
which 
consists 
in 
the 
abundance 
of 
what 
men 
desire. 
The 
Egyptians, 
Greeks, 
and 
Romans, 
had 
wealth; 
and 
this, 
though, 
perhaps, 
not 
consisting 
in 
the 
same 
objects, 
was, 
perhaps, 
not 
inferior 
to 
ours 
at 
the 
present 
time; 
but 
as 
wealth, 
purely 
and 
simply, 
no 
comparison 
between 
different 
nations 
was 
necessary, 
farther 
than 
that 
men's 
desires 
are 
augmented, 
by 
seeing 
the 
abundance 
possessed 
by 
others; 
and 
therefore 
they 
become 
comparative, 
as 
to 
wealth. 
Without, 
however, 
entering 
into 
a 
long 
examination 
respecting 
the 
various 
possible 
combinations 
of 
wealth 
and 
power, 
which 
are 
something 
similarly 
connected 
in 
states, 
as 
health 
and 
strength 
are 
in 
the 
animal 
body, 
{11} 
let 
both 
be 
considered 
only 
in 
a 
comparative 
way; 
the 
comparison 
either 
being 
made 
with 
other 
nations 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
or 
with 
the 
same 
nation 
at 
different 
times. 
Thus, 
for 
example, 
in 
comparing 
the 
wealth 
and 
power 
of 
Britain 
now, 
with 
what 
they 
were 
at 
the 
latter 
end 
of 
Queen 
Elizabeth's 
reign, 
we 
find 
that 
the 
merchants 
of 
Liverpool, 
during 
the 
first 
three 
years 
of 
last 
=sic= 
war, 
fitted 
out 
a 
force 
of 
privateers 
equal 
to 
the 
Spanish 
armada; 
and 
consequently 
superior 
to 
the 
whole 
naval 
force 
of 
England 
at 
that 
time; 
there 
can 
be 
no 
doubt, 
then, 
that 
both 
the 
wealth 
and 
power 
of 
the 
nation 
are 
increased. 
Again, 
if 
we 
find 
that 
our 
ships 
block 
up 
the 


{11} 
A 
man 
may 
be 
very 
feeble, 
yet 
in 
very 
good 
health 
for 
his 
whole 
life-time. 
He 
may 
also 
have 
great 
strength, 
though 
he 
may 
not 
enjoy 
a 
very 
good 
state 
of 
health; 
yet 
nevertheless, 
health 
and 
strength 

are 
very 
intimately 
connected, 
and 
never 
can 
be 
completely 
separated.

ports 
of 
Holland, 
and 
prevent 
their 
navy 
from 
venturing 
to 
sea, 
we 
must 
conclude, 
that 
the 
relative 
power 
of 
the 
two 
nations 
is 
altered, 
since 
the 
time 
that 
the 
Dutch 
fleet 
rode 
triumphant 
in 
the 
river 
Thames. 
But, 
if 
we 
want 
to 
make 
a 
comparison 
between 
the 
naval 
power 
of 
England 
and 
that 
of 
France 
and 
Spain, 
we 
must 
not 
compare 
it 
with 
the 
strength 
of 
their 
navies 
in 
the 
year 
1780, 
when 
they 
bid 
us 
defiance 
at 
Plymouth, 
but 
take 
things 
actually 
as 
they 
are 
at 
this 
present 
time. 


When 
a 
nation 
is 
upon 
an 
equality 
with 
others, 
for 
wealth, 
it 
may 
be 
considered 
as 
neither 
deserving 
the 
name 
of 
a 
rich 
or 
a 
poor 
nation, 
whatever 
its 
real 
wealth 
or 
poverty 
may 
be. 
The 
same 
thing 
holds 
with 
power. 
When 
a 
nation 
is 
merely 
able 
to 
protect 
itself, 
but 
fully 
equal 
to 
that, 
though 
unable 
to 
make 
conquests, 
or 
aggrandize 
itself, 
against 
the 
will 
of 
other 
nations, 
it 
may 
be 
said 
to 
be 
neither 
weak 
nor 
strong. 
Thus, 
for 
example, 
Denmark 
as 
a 
nation 
is 
upon 
a 
par 
with 
others; 
and 
neither 
to 
be 
called 
wealthy 
and 
powerful, 
nor 
weak 
and 
poor, 
though 
it 
certainly 
has 
both 
more 
actual 
wealth 
and 
power 
than 
it 
had 
in 
the 
eighth 
century, 
when 
the 
Danes 
burnt 
London, 
Paris, 
and 
Cologne. 


Thus, 
then, 
with 
respect 
to 
my 
reasoning, 
the 
whole 
is 
to 
be 
considered 
as 
applying 
to 
other 
nations 
at 
the 
same 
time; 
and 
the 
degree 
they 
are 
above 
or 
below 
par, 
is 
the 
measure 
of 
wealth 
and 
power, 
poverty 
and 
weakness. 
{12} 


But, 
with 
respect 
to 
a 
nation 
itself, 
wealth 
is 
comparative 
in 
the 
progression 
of 
time. 
In 
speaking 
of 
power, 
we 
compare 
nations 
at 
the 
same 
period, 
and, 
in 
speaking 
of 
wealth, 
we 
may 
either 
compare 
a 
nation 
with 
itself 
at 
different 
periods, 
or 
with 
others 
at 
the 
same 
time. 


We 
shall 
not 
find 
any 
example 
of 
a 
nation's 
becoming 
less 
wealthy 
whilst 
it 
increased 
in 
power; 
but 
we 
shall 
find 
many 



instances 
of 
nations 
becoming 
wealthy 
whilst 
they 
were 
losing 
their 
power, 
though, 


{12} 
According 
to 
this 
definition, 
if 
all 
the 
nations 
on 
earth 
were 
to 
increase 
in 
wealth 
and 
power 
equally, 
they 
would 
be 
considered 
as 
stationary; 
their 
relative 
situations 
would 
remain 
the 
same; 
like 
those 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
or 
those 
of 
soldiers 
who 
march 
in 
a 
regiment 
with 
perfect 
regularity, 
and 
retain 
their 
relative 
portion 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
if 
they 
stood 
still. 
But 
this 
case, 
among 
nations, 
is 
only 
an 
imaginary 
one; 
therefore, 
the 
definition 
given 
answers 
the 
true 
purpose 
of 
investigation.

together 
with 
the 
power, 
the 
wealth 
always, 
a 
little 
sooner 
or 
a 
little 
later, 
vanishes 
away. 


Sometimes 
nations 
owe 
their 
wealth 
and 
greatness 
to 
accidental 
causes, 
that, 
from 
their 
nature, 
must 
vanish 
away; 
and 
sometimes 
to 
causes 
which, 
depending 
upon 
the 
nations 
themselves, 
may 
be 
prolonged. 
In 
general, 
both 
the 
two 
sorts 
of 
causes 
have 
united 
to 
render 
every 
nation 
great 
that 
has 
been 
distinguished 
amongst 
others 
for 
riches 
or 
power. 


The 
causes, 
then, 
divide 
themselves 
into 
two 
of 
distinct 
kinds;--those 
which 
are 
independent 
of 
the 
nation 
itself, 
and 
those 
over 
which 
it 
has 
some 
degree 
of 
influence 
and 
controul. 


In 
early 
ages, 
when 
knowledge 
was 
but 
little 
advanced, 
and 
when 
the 
small 
stock 
that 
had 
been 
accumulated 
was 
confined 
nearly 
to 
a 
single 
spot, 
the 
first 
description 
of 
causes 
were 
the 
principal 
ones. 
--Local 
situation, 
priority 
in 
discovery, 
or 
in 
establishment, 
gave 
to 
one 
nation 
a 
superiority 
over 
others, 
and 
occasioned 
the 
accumulation 
of 
wealth, 
and 
the 
acquisition 
of 
power 
and 
territory. 
{13} 
As 
in 
the 



early 
stages 
of 
human 
life, 
a 
few 
years 
more 
or 
less 
occasion 
a 
greater 
difference, 
both 
in 
physical 
powers 
and 
mental 
faculties, 
than 
any 
difference 
of 
innate 
genius, 
or 
adventitious 
circumstances; 
so, 
in 
the 
early 
days 
of 
the 
world, 
when 
it 
was 
young 
in 
knowledge, 
and 
scanty 
in 
population, 
priority 
of 
settlement 
gave 
a 
great 
advantage 
to 
one 
nation 
over 
others, 
and, 
of 
consequence, 
enabled 
them 
to 
rule 
over 
others; 
thus 
the 
Assyrian 
and 
Egyptian 
empires 
were 
great, 
powerful, 
and 
extensive, 
while 
the 
nations 
that 
were 
beyond 
their 
reach 
were 
divided 
into 
small 
states 
or 
kingdoms, 
on 
the 
most 
contemptible 
scale. 


Time, 
however, 
did 
away 
the 
advantages 
resulting 
from 
priority 
of 
establishment. 


Local 
situation 
was 
another 
cause 
of 
superiority, 
of 
a 
more 
permanent 
nature; 
but 
this, 
also, 
new 
discovery 
has 
transferred 
from 
one 
na


{13} 
It 
is 
not 
meant, 
by 
any 
means, 
to 
enter 
into 
an 
inquiry, 
much 
less 
controversy, 
respecting 
the 
antiquity 
of 
mankind; 
but 
it 
is 
very 
clear 
that 
the 
knowledge 
of 
arts 
and 
sciences 
can 
be 
traced 
to 
an 
infant 
state 
about 
two 
thousand 
years 
before 
the 
Christian 
aera.

tion 
to 
another. 
Qualities 
of 
the 
soil 
and 
climate 
are 
counteracted 
by 
the 
nature 
and 
habits 
of 
the 
inhabitants, 
which 
frequently, 
in 
the 
end, 
give 
the 
superiority 
where 
there 
was 
at 
first 
an 
inferiority. 


If 
ever 
the 
nations 
of 
the 
world 
come 
to 
a 
state 
of 
permanence, 
(which 
in 
all 
probability 
will 
never 
be 
the 
case,) 
it 
must 
be 
when 
population 
is 
nearly 
proportioned 
to 
the 
means 
of 
subsistence 
in 
different 
parts; 
when 
knowledge 
is 
nearly 
equally 
distributed 
and 
when 
no 
great 
discoveries 
remain 
to 
be 
made 
either 
in 
arts, 
science, 
or 
geography. 



While 
the 
causes 
from 
which 
wealth 
and 
power 
rise 
in 
a 
superior 
degree, 
are 
liable 
to 
change 
from 
one 
nation 
to 
another, 
wealth 
and 
power 
must 
be 
liable 
to 
the 
same 
alterations 
and 
changes 
of 
place; 
so 
long 
any 
equal 
balance 
among 
nations 
must 
be 
artificial. 
But 
when 
circumstances 
become 
similar, 
and 
when 
the 
pressure 
becomes 
equal 
on 
all 
sides, 
then 
nations, 
like 
the 
particles 
of 
a 
fluid, 
though 
free 
to 
move, 
having 
lost 
their 
impulse, 
will 
remain 
at 
rest. 


If 
such 
a 
state 
of 
things 
should 
ever 
arrive, 
then 
the 
wealth 
and 
power 
would 
be 
only 
real, 
not 
comparative. 
The 
whole 
might 
be 
very 
rich, 
very 
affluent, 
and 
possess 
great 
abundance 
of 
every 
thing, 
either 
for 
enjoyment 
or 
for 
defence, 
without 
one 
nation 
having 
an 
advantage 
over 
another: 
they 
would 
be 
on 
an 
equality. 


But 
this 
state 
of 
things 
is 
far 
from 
being 
likely 
soon 
to 
take 
place. 
Population 
is 
far 
from 
come 
to 
its 
equilibrium, 
and 
knowledge 
{14} 
is 
farther 
distant 
still. 
Russia 
and 
America, 
in 
particular, 
are 
both 
behind 
in 
population, 
and 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
latter 
country 
are 
far 
from 
being 
on 
a 
par 
in 
knowledge 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
Europe; 
when 
they 
become 
so, 
the 
balance 
will 
be 
overturned, 
and 
must 
be 
re-established 
anew. 


The 
great 
discoveries 
that 
have 
taken 
place 
in 
knowledge 
and 
geography 
have 
been 
connected. 


While 
navigation 
was 
little 
understood, 
the 
borders 
of 
the 
Mediterranean 
Sea, 
and 
the 
islands 
in 
it, 
were 
naturally 
the 
first 
places 
for 
wealth 
and 
commerce. 


The 
discovery 
of 
the 
compass, 
and 
others 
that 
followed, 
rendered 


{14} 
By 
knowledge 
is 
only 
meant 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
arts 
that 
make 
men 
useful,

such 
as 
agriculture, 
manufactures, 
legislation, 

&c.

the 
navigation 
of 
the 
open 
ocean, 
more 
easy 
and 
safe 
than 
that 
of 
the 
circumscribed 
seas. 
This 
laid 
a 
great 
foundation 
for 
change 
and 
discovery; 
it 
brought 
Britain 
into 
importance, 
ruined 
Italy, 
Genoa, 
Venice, 
&c. 
and 
has 
laid 
the 
foundation 
for 
further 
changes 
still. 


As 
for 
discoveries 
in 
arts, 
it 
would 
be 
bold 
and 
presumptuous 
indeed 
to 
attempt 
to 
set 
any 
bounds 
to 
them. 
Discoveries, 
however, 
that 
alter 
the 
relations 
of 
mankind 
very 
materially, 
are 
probably 
near 
at 
an 
end. 
In 
arts 
they 
give 
only 
a 
temporary 
preference. 


{15} 
If 
a 
method 
should 
be 
discovered 
to 
cultivate 
a 
field 
with 
half 
the 
trouble, 
and 
to 
double 
the 
produce, 
which 
seems 
very 
possible, 
it 
would 
be 
a 
great 
discovery, 
and 
alter 
the 
general 
state 
of 
mankind 
considerably; 
but 
it 
would 
soon 
be 
extended 
to 
all 
nations, 
as 
the 
use 
of 
gunpowder 
has 
been. 
New 
produce, 
or 
means 
of 
procuring 
the 
old 
more 
easily, 
are 
the 
things 
chiefly 
sought 
after. 
Potatoes, 
coffee, 
tea, 
sugar, 
cotton, 
silk, 
distilled 
spirits, 
are 
new 
productions, 
unknown 
to 
the 
Romans. 
Glass, 
gunpowder, 
printing, 
windmills, 
watermills, 
steam-
engines, 
and 
the 
most 
part 
of 
spinning 
and 
weaving 
machines, 
are 
new 
inventions, 
but 
they 
can 
be 
extended 
to 
all 
countries. 
The 
mariners 
compass 
changed 
the 
relative 
position 
of 
places, 
and 
no 
new 
invention 
of 
the 
same 
importance, 
as 
to 
its 
effects 
on 
nations, 
probably 
can 
take 
place. 
Navigation 
does 
not 
admit 
of 
a 
similar 
improvement 
to 
that 
which 
it 
has 
received. 
If 
goods 
could 
be 
conveyed 
for 
a 
quarter 
of 
the 
present 
price 
it 
would 
not 
produce 
the 
same 
sort 
of 
effect. 
To 
render 
navigating 
the 
ocean 
practicable 
was 
a 
greater 
thing 
than 
any 
possible 
improvement 
on 
that 
practicability. 
As 
for 
new 
discoveries 
in 
geography, 
they 
are 
nearly 
at 
an 
end. 
The 
form 
and 
the 
extent 
of 
the 
earth 
are 
known, 
and 
the 
habitable 
regions 
are 
nearly 
all 
explored. 


We 
have, 
then, 
arrived 
at 
a 
state 
of 
things 
where 
many 
of 



the 
causes 
that 
formerly 
operated 
on 
reducing 
wealthy 
nations 
can 
never 
again 
produce 
a 
similar 
effect. 
But 
still 
there 
are 
other 
causes 
which

The 
end 
of 
all 
discovery 
is 
to 
supply 
men 
with 
what 
they 
want; 
and, 
accordingly, 
all 
nations 
that 
are 
considered 
as 
civilised 
find 
the 
means 
of 
participating 
in 
the 
advantage 
of 
a 
new 
discovery, 
by 
imitating 
that 
which 
possesses 
the 
invention 
first, 
and 
that 
is 
done 
almost 
immediately. 
It 
was 
very 
different 
formerly.

rate 
as 
they 
did 
formerly; 
accordingly, 
wealth 
and 
power 
are 
very 
unequally 
distributed 
amongst 
nations 
at 
this 
moment; 
and, 
in 
Europe, 
there 
is 
not 
one 
nation 
that 
is 
not 
either 
rising 
or 
on 
its 
decline.

The 
purpose 
of 
the 
present 
Inquiry 
is, 
by 
tracing 
those 
causes 
that 
still 
continue 
to 
operate, 
to 
discover 
how 
nations 
that 
now 
stand 
high 
may 
be 
prevented 
from 
sinking 
below 
their 
level: 
a 
thing 
to 
which

shews

have 
a 
natural 
tendency, 
and 
which 
history 
shews

distressing 
consequences. 


We 
do 
not 
labour 
in 
Utopia 
on 
schemes, 
but 
in 
Britain 
on 
real 
business; 
and 
the 
inquiry 
is, 
how 
a 
nation, 
situated 
as 
this 
is, 
and 
having 
more 
than 
its 
share 
of 
power, 
importance, 
and 
wealth, 
may 
prolong 
their 
possession? 


In 
this 
Inquiry 
we 
shall 
begin 
with 
taking 
a 
lesson 
from 
history, 
which 
will 
serve 
as 
some 
guide. 


As 
to 
the 
rise 
of 
other 
nations, 
we 
neither 
can 
nor 
should 
attempt 
to 
impede 
that; 
let 
them 
rise 
to 
our 
level, 
but 
let 
us 
not 
sink 
down 
to 
theirs.

CHAP. 
II. 


Of 
the 
General 
Causes 
that 
operate, 
both 
externally 
and 
internally, 
in 
bringing 
down 
Nations 
that 
have 
risen 
above 
their 
Level 
to 
that 
assigned 
to 
them 
by 
their 
Extent, 
Fertility, 
and 
Population; 
and 
of 
the 
Manner 
in 
which 
Wealth 
destroyed 
Power 
in 
ancient 
Nations. 


WITHOUT 
considering 
the 
particular 
causes 
that 
have 
raised 
some 
nations 
greatly 
above 
others, 
there 
are 
some 
general 
causes 
of 
decline 
which 
operate 
in 
all 
cases; 
but 
even 
the 
general 
causes 
are 
not 
always 
similar, 
they 
vary 
their 
way 
of 
producing 
the 
effect, 
according 
to 
circumstances. 


If 
a 
nation 
excels 
in 
arts 
and 
manufactures, 
others 
acquire 
a 
taste 
for 
what 
they 
make, 
and 
imitate 
them. 
If 
they 
excel 
in 
the 
art 
of 
war, 
they 
teach 
their 
enemies 
to 
fight 
as 
well 
as 
themselves. 
If 
their 
territories 
are 
large, 
the 
unprotected 
and 
far 
distant 
parts 
provoke 
attack 
and 
plunder. 
They 
become 
more 
difficult 
and 
expensive 
to 
govern. 
If 
they 
owe 
their 
superiority 
to 
climate 
and 
soil, 
they 
generally 
preserve 
it 
but 
a 
short 
time. 
Necessity 
acts 
so 
much 
more 
powerfully 
on 
those 
who 
do 
not 
enjoy 
the 
same 
advantages, 
that 
they 
soon 
come 
to 
an 
equality. 
-In 
whatever 
the 
superiority 
exists, 
emulation 
and 
envy 
prompt 
to 
rivalship 
in 
peace, 
and 
to 
frequent 
trials 
of 
strength 
in 
war. 
The 
contempt 
and 
pride 
which 
accompany 
wealth 
and 
power, 
and 
the 
envy 
and 
jealousy 
they 
excite 
amongst 
other 
nations, 
are 
continual 
causes 
of 
change, 
and 
form 
the 
great 
basis 
of 
the 
revolutions 
amongst 
the 
human 
race. 


The 
wants 
of 
men 
increase 
with 
their 
knowledge 
of 
what 
it 
is 
good 
to 
enjoy; 
and 
it 
is 
the 
desire 
to 
gratify 
those 
wants 
that 
increases 
necessity, 
and 
this 
necessity 
is 
the 
spur 
to 
action. 



There 
are 
a 
few 
natural 
wants 
that 
require 
no 
knowledge 
in 
order 
to 
be 
felt; 
such 
as 
hunger 
and 
thirst, 
and 
the 
other 
appetites 
which 
men 
have 
in 
common 
with 
all 
animals, 
and 
which 
are 
linked, 
as 
it 
[end 
of 
page 
#14] 
were, 
to 
their 
existence. 
{16} 
But 
while 
nations 
satisfy 
themselves 
with 
supplying 
such 
wants, 
there 
is 
neither 
wealth 
nor 
power 
amongst 
them. 
Of 
consequence, 
it 
is 
not 
into 
the 
conduct 
of 
such 
that 
we 
are 
to 
inquire. 


Excepting, 
however, 
those 
wants 
which 
are 
inseparable 
from 
our 
existence, 
all 
the 
others 
are, 
more 
or 
less, 
fictitious, 
and 
increase 
with 
our 
knowledge 
and 
habits; 
it 
is, 
therefore, 
evident 
that 
the 
nation 
that 
is 
the 
highest 
above 
others 
feels 
the 
fewest 
wants; 
or, 
in 
other 
words, 
feels 
no 
wants. 
She 
knows 
nothing 
that 
she 
does 
not 
possess, 
and 
therefore 
may 
be 
said 
to 
want 
nothing; 
or 
which 
is 
the 
same 
thing, 
not 
knowing 
what 
she 
does 
want, 
she 
makes 
no 
effort 
to 
obtain 
it. 


Thus 
necessity 
of 
rising 
higher, 
does 
not 
operate, 
on 
a 
nation 
that 
sees 
none 
higher 
than 
itself; 
at 
least, 
it 
does 
only 
operate 
in 
a 
very 
slender 
degree. 
{17} 
Whereas, 
in 
the 
nation 
that 
is 
behind 
hand 
with 
other 
nations 
around, 
every 
one 
is 
led 
by 
emulation 
and 
envy, 
and 
by 
a 
feeling 
of 
their 
own 
wants, 
to 
imitate 
and 
equal 
those 
that 
are 
farther 
advanced. 


{16} 
A 
child 
cries 
for 
food 
without 
knowing 
what 
it 
is; 
and 
all 
the 
other 
natural 
appetites, 
though 
they 
may 
be 
increased 
by 
habit, 
by 
knowledge, 
and 
fancy, 
are 
independent 
of 
the 
mind 
in 
its 
first 
state. 
{17} 
The 
necessity, 
no 
doubt, 
continues 
to 
preserve 
what 
they 
have; 
and, 
therefore, 
tends 
to 
keep 
them 
in 
a 
permanent 
state. 
Some 
individuals 
again, 
in 
less 
affluence 
than 
others, 
endeavour 
to 
equal 
them; 
by 
which 
means 
some 
progress 
is 
still 
making 
in 
the 
nation 
that 
possesses 
the 
greatest 
share 
of 
wealth 
and 
power; 
but 
it 
is 
only 
partial 
and 
feeble. 
Those 
who 
live 
in 
the 
nation 
that 
is 
the 
most 
advanced 
are 
contented 
and 
have 
all 
they 
wish; 
they 
possess 
every 
thing 
of 
which 
they 
know, 
they 
can 
have 
no 
particular 
desire 
for 
any 
thing 
they 
have 
not 
got, 

that 
will 
produce 
great 
energy 
and 
exertion. 
A 
man 
may 
wish 
for 
wings, 
or 
for 
perpetual 
youth; 
but, 
as 
he 
can 
scarcely 
expect 
to 
obtain 
either, 
he 
will 
make 
little 
exertion. 
With 
things 
really 
attainable, 
but 
not 
known, 
the 
case 
is 
less 
productive 
of 
energy 
still. 
The 
people 
of 
Asia 
found 
silk 
a 
natural 
produce 
of 
their 
country; 
till 
the 
Europeans 
saw 
it, 
they 
never 
attempted 
to 
produce 
so 
rich 
a 
material; 
but 
no 
pains 
has 
since 
been 
spared 
to 
try 
to 
produce 
it, 
in 
almost 
every 
country, 
where 
there 
was 
the 
least 
chance 
of 
success. 
We 
imitated 
the 
silk 
mills 
of 
Italy, 
and 
the 
Italians 
(as 
well 
as 
many 
other 
nations) 
are 
now 
imitating 
our 
cotton 
mills. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
a 
nation 
that 
follows 
others, 
it 
always 
knows 
what 
it 
wants, 
and 
may 
judge 
whether 
it 
can 
obtain 
it; 
but 
the 
nation 
the 
most 
advanced, 
gropes 
in 
the 
dark.

Thus 
it 
is, 
that 
necessity 
acts 
but 
in 
a 
very 
inferior 
degree 
on 
the 
nation 
that 
is 
the 
farthest 
advanced; 
while 
it 
operates 
in 
a 
very 
powerful 
way 
on 
those 
that 
are 
in 
arrear; 
and 
this 
single 
reason, 
without 
the 
intervention 
of 
wars 
or 
any 
sort 
of 
contest 
or 
robbery, 
would, 
in 
the 
process 
of 
time, 
bring 
nations 
to 
a 
sort 
of 
equality 
in 
wealth 
and 
refinement; 
that 
is, 
it 
would 
bring 
them 
all 
into 
possession 
of 
the 
means 
of 
gratifying 
their 
wants. 


War, 
excited 
by 
the 
violent 
and 
vile 
passions,--by 
the 
overbearing 
pride 
and 
insolence 
of 
one, 
and 
the 
envy 
and 
villainy 
of 
another, 
derange 
this 
natural 
and 
smooth 
operation, 
which, 
nevertheless, 
continues 
to 
act 
in 
silence 
at 
all 
times, 
and 
in 
every 
circumstance, 
and 
which, 
indeed, 
is 
in 
general 
the 
chief 
cause 
of 
those 
very 
disorders 
by 
which 
its 
operations 
are 
sometimes 
facilitated; 
sometimes 
apparently 
interrupted; 
sometimes, 
their 
effect 
for 
a 
moment 
reversed; 
but 
their 
action 
never, 
for 
one 
instant, 
totally 
suspended. 


The 
desire 
of 
enjoyment 
makes 
all 
mankind 
act 
as 
if 
they 
were 
running 
a 
race. 
They 
always 
keep 
the 
goal 
in 
view, 
though 
they 
attempt 
to 
be 
the 
foremost 
to 
arrive 
at 
it 
by 
various 
means. 
But 
the 
greatest 
exertions 
are 
never 
made 
by 
those 
who 
have 
got 
the 
advance 
of 



their 
competitors. 
Amongst 
the 
wants 
of 
mankind, 
ease 
is 
one 
of 
very 
permanent 
operation; 
and 
whenever 
the 
necessity 
of 
supplying 
other 
wants 
ceases, 
the 
desire 
of 
supplying 
that, 
leads 
to 
a 
state 
of 
inaction 
and 
rest. 
{18} 
To 
seek 
ease, 
however, 
does 
not 
imply 
necessarily 
to 
seek 
total 
inaction 
or 
rest; 
a 
diminished 
exertion 
is 
comparative 
ease; 
and 
this 
is 
always 
observable 
in 
a 
state 
of 
prosperity, 
either 
of 
an 
individual 
or 
of 
a 
nation, 
after 
the 
prosperity 
has 
been 
long 
enough 


{18} 
The 
truth 
of 
this 
may 
be 
disputed 
by 
those 
who 
look 
at 
mankind 
in 
an 
artificial 
state; 
because 
a 
variety 
of 
their 
actions 
seem 
without 
any 
particular 
motive. 
But 
not 
the 
smallest 
exertion 
is 
ever 
made 
without 
it. 
The 
man 
who 
walks 
out 
and 
takes 
exercise, 
wants 
health 
or 
amusement 
as 
much 
as 
the 
working 
man 
does 
bread. 
Even 
those 
who 
toil 
in 
the 
rounds 
of 
pleasure, 
are 
always 
in 
pursuit 
of 
something. 
Their 
not 
finding 
the 
object 
is 
another 
part 
of 
the 
consideration; 
but 
they 
always 
have 
one 
in 
view. 
As 
to 
savages, 
and 
the 
poorer 
classes 
of 
people, 
they 
shew 
their 
propensity 
by 
a 
more 
simple 
process; 
that 
is, 
merely 
by 
resting 
inactive, 
when 
they 
are 
not 
compelled 
to 
labour.

enjoyed 
to 
create 
a 
certain 
degree 
of 
lassitude 
and 
indifference, 
which 
it 
does 
on 
every 
nation. 
{19} 


Whatever 
may 
be 
the 
accidental 
circumstance 
which 
first 
raises 
one 
nation 
above 
others, 
or 
the 
train 
of 
adventitious 
ones 
that 
increase 
for 
a 
while 
and 
continue 
that 
superiority, 
nothing 
can 
be 
more 
clear 
and 
certain, 
than, 
that 
they 
have 
a 
natural 
tendency 
to 
come 
back 
to 
a 
level, 
merely 
by 
the 
exertions 
of 
men 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
acquiring 
wealth 
by 
industry, 
and 
without 
any 
of 
those 
causes 
which 
arise 
out 
of 
war, 
or 
interrupting 
the 
career 
of 
each 
other. 


When, 
from 
the 
conduct 
of 
one 
nation 
towards 
another, 
or 
from 
whatever 
other 
cause 
war, 
=sic= 
becomes 
the 
means 
by 
which 



the 
superiority 
of 
two 
nations 
is 
to 
be 
decided, 
there 
are 
many 
things 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
least 
wealthy 
nation. 


It 
has 
less 
to 
protect 
and 
to 
lose, 
and 
more 
to 
attack 
and 
to 
gain; 
the 
task 
is 
much 
easier 
and 
more 
alluring. 
There 
is 
a 
sort 
of 
energy 
in 
attempting 
to 
obtain, 
that 
is 
not 
to 
be 
found 
in 
those 
who 
are 
only 
exerting 
themselves 
to 
keep, 
of 
which 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
explain 
the 
cause, 
but 
of 
which 
the 
existence 
is 
very 
certain. 


Where 
natural 
strength, 
and 
the 
struggle 
with 
want 
is 
great, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
with 
nations 
who 
have 
made 
but 
little 
progress 
in 
acquiring 
wealth, 
the 
contest 
with 
a 
people 
more 
enervated 
by 
ease, 
and 
less 
inured 
to 
toil 
is 
very 
unequal, 
and 
does 
more 
than 
compensate 
those 
artificial 
aids 
which 
are 
derived 
from 
the 
possession 
of 
property. 
{20} 
From 
this 
cause, 
the 
triumph 
of 
poorer 
over 
more 
wealthy 
nations 
has 
generally 
arisen, 
and, 
in 
most 
cases, 
has 
occasioned 
the 
contest 
to 
end 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
more 
hardy 
and 
poorer 
people. 


Of 
the 
revolutions 
that 
took 
place 
in 
the

and

Doctor 
Garth,

his 
admirable 
poem 
of 
the 
Dispensary,

Even 
health 
for 
want 
of 
change 
becomes

This 
is 
the 
case 
with 
nations 
sunk 
in 
prosperity.

Why 
men 
should 
have 
been 
less 
tenacious 
to 
keep 
that 
which 
is 
fairly 
theirs, 
than 
rapaciously

a 
strange 
thing;

nothing

more

very 
great,

nerally 
traced 
as 
the 
causes. 
In 
those 
ancient 
nations 
any 
considerable 
degree 
of 
luxury 
and 
military 
success 
were 
incompatible 
with 
each 
other; 
but, 
in 
the 
present 
age, 
the 
case 
is 
greatly 
altered. 
Military 
discipline 
is 
not 
near 
so 
severe 
as 
formerly, 
and 
bodily 
strength 
has 
but 
little 
effect, 
while 
the 
engines 
of 
war 
can 
only 
be 
procured 
by 
those 
resources 
which 
wealth 
affords; 
by 
this 
means, 
the 
decline 
of 
nations 
is, 
at 
least, 
now 
become 
a 
less 
natural 
and 
slower 
progress 
than 
formerly; 
the 
operations 
of 
war 
have 
now 
a 
quite 
different 
tendency 
from 
what 
they 
formerly 
had, 
and 
this 
effect 
is 
produced 
by 
the 
introduction 
of 
cannon, 
and 
a 
different 
mode 
of 
attack 
and 
defence; 
to 
carry 
on 
which, 
a 
very 
considerable 
degree 
of 
wealth 
is 
necessary. 
{21} 


In 
former 
times, 
the 
character 
and 
situation 
of 
the 
people, 
the 
object 
they 
had 
in 
view, 
their 
bravery 
and 
the 
skill 
of 
their 
leaders, 
did 
every 
thing; 
but 
now 
the 
skill 
of 
leaders 
and 
the 
command 
of 
money 
are 
the 
chief 
objects; 
for 
there 
is 
not 
sufficient 
difference 
between 
any 
two 
nations 
in 
Europe 
as 
to 
counterbalance 
those: 
and, 
indeed, 
(except 
so 
far 
as 
military 
skill 
is 
accidental,) 
it 
is 
to 
be 
found 
principally 
in 
nations 
who 
have 
a 
sufficient 
degree 
of 
wealth 
to 
exercise 
it 
and 
call 
it 
into 
action. 


We 
shall 
see 
that 
the 
first 
revolutions 
in 
the 
world 
were 
effected 
by 
the 
natural 
strength, 
energy, 
and 
bravery 
of 
poor 
nations 
triumphing 
over 
those 
that 
were 
less 
hardy, 
in 
consequence 
of 
the 
enjoyment 
of 
wealth, 
until 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Romans; 
who, 
like 
other 
nations, 
first 
triumphed 
by 
means 
of 
superior 
energy 
and 
bravery; 
and, 
afterwards 
by 
making 
war 
a 
trade, 
continued, 
by 
having 
regular 
standing 
armies, 
to 
conquer 
the 
nations 
who 
had 
only 
temporary 
levies, 
or 
militias, 
to 
fight 
in 
their 
defence. 


The 
triumph 
of 
poor 
nations, 
over 
others 
in 
many 
respects 
their 
superiors, 
continued 
during 
the 
middle 
ages, 
but 
the 
wealth 
acquired 
by 
certain 
nations 
then 
was 
not 
wrested 
from 
them 
by 
war, 
but 
by 
an 
accidental 
and 
unforeseen 
change 
in 
the 
channel 
through 
which 
it 



{21} 
An 
idea 
has 
gone 
abroad, 
since 
the 
successes 
of 
the 
French 
armies, 
that 
money 
is 
not 
necessary 
to 
war, 
even 
in 
the 
present 
times. 
It 
will 
be 
shewn, 
in 
its 
proper 
place, 
that 
the 
French 
armies 
were 
maintained 
at 
very 
great 
expense, 
and 
that 
a 
poor 
country 
could 
not 
have 
done 
what 
France 
did. 
-=


flowed. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
that 
this 
change 
took 
place, 
without 
the 
intervention 
of 
force, 
the 
art 
of 
war 
changed 
in 
favour 
of 
wealthy 
nations, 
but 
the 
changes 
took 
place 
by 
slow 
degrees, 
and 
the 
power 
of 
nations 
now 
may 
almost 
be 
estimated 
by 
their 
disposable 
incomes. 


This 
change, 
however, 
has 
by 
no 
means 
secured 
the 
prosperity 
of 
wealthy 
nations; 
it 
has 
only 
prevented 
poor 
ones, 
unable 
by 
means 
of 
fair 
competition 
to 
do 
by 
conquest 
what 
they 
could 
not 
effect 
by 
perseverance 
in 
arts 
and 
industry; 
for, 
in 
other 
respects, 
though 
it 
makes 
the 
prosperity 
of 
a 
nation 
more 
dependant 
=sic= 
on 
wealth, 
and 
more 
independent 
of 
violence; 
it 
prevents 
any 
nation 
from 
preserving 
its 
political 
importance 
after 
it 
loses 
its 
riches. 
It 
does 
not 
by 
any 
means 
interrupt 
that 
progress 
by 
which 
poor 
nations 
gradually 
rise 
up 
and 
rival 
richer 
ones 
in 
arts. 
It 
has 
not 
done 
away 
the 
advantages 
that 
arise 
from 
superior 
industry 
and 
attention 
to 
business, 
or 
from 
the 
gradual 
introduction 
of 
knowledge 
amongst 
the 
more 
ignorant, 
thereby 
lessening 
their 
inferiority, 
and 
tending 
to 
bring 
nations 
to 
a 
level; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
by 
increasing 
the 
advantages, 
and 
securing 
the 
gradual 
triumphs 
gained 
by 
arts 
and 
industry, 
from 
the 
violence 
of 
war, 
it 
makes 
wealth 
a 
more 
desirable 
object, 
and 
the 
loss 
of 
it 
a 
greater 
misfortune. 
It 
tends 
to 
augment 
the 
natural 
propensity 
that 
there 
is 
in 
poor 
nations 
to 
equal 
richer 
ones 
{22}, 
although 
it, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
augments 
the 
difficulty 
of 
accomplishing 
their 
intentions. 


The 
superior 
energy 
of 
poverty 
and 
necessity 
which 
leads 
men, 
under 
this 
pressure, 
to 
act 
incessantly 
in 
whatever 
way 
they 
have 
it 



in 
their 
power 
to 
act, 
and 
that 
seems 
likely 
to 
bring 
them 
on 
a 
level 
with 
those 
that 
are 
richer, 
is 
then 
the 
ground-work 
of 
the 
rise 
and 
fall 
of 
nations, 
as 
well 
as 
of 
individuals. 
This 
tendency 
is 
sometimes 
favoured 
by 
particular 
circumstances, 
and 
sometimes 
it 
is 
counteracted 
by 
them; 
but 
its 
operation 
is 
incessant, 
and 
it 
has 
never 
yet 
failed 
in 
producing 
its 
effect, 
for 
the 
triumph 
of 
poverty 
over 
wealth 
on 
the 
great 
scale 
as 
on 
the 
small, 
though 
very 
irregular 
in 
its 
pace, 
has 
continued 
without 
interruption 
from 
the 
earliest 
records 
to 
the 
present 
moment. 


{22} 
The 
present 
inferiority 
of 
Poland, 
Denmark, 
Sweden, 
Spain, 
and 
Portugal, 
compared 
with 
the 
rank 
they 
held 
in 
former 
times, 
is 
easily 
accounted 
for 
by 
looking 
at 
the 
scale 
of 
their 
revenues.

CHAP. 
III. 


Of 
the 
Nations 
that 
rose 
to 
Wealth 
and 
Power 
previously 
to 
the 
Conquests 
in 
Asia 
and 
Africa, 
and 
the 
Causes 
which 
ruined 
them. 


PREVIOUS 
to 
the 
conquests 
made 
by 
Alexander 
the 
Great, 
the 
history 
of 
ancient 
nations 
is 
confused, 
incomplete, 
and 
inaccurate. 


During 
the 
contests 
of 
his 
successors, 
the 
intricacy 
and 
confusion 
are 
still 
continued, 
but 
materials 
are 
more 
plentiful, 
more 
accurate, 
and 
more 
authentic. 


During 
the 
first 
period, 
excepting 
what 
is 
contained 
in 
sacred 
history, 
a 
few 
detached 
facts, 
collected 
by 
writers 
long 
after, 
are 



our 
only 
guides 
in 
judging 
of 
the 
situation 
of 
ancient 
states, 
some 
of 
which 
consisted 
of 
great 
empires, 
and 
others 
of 
single 
cities 
possessed 
of 
a 
very 
small 
territory. 


Add 
to 
this, 
that 
great 
and 
striking 
events 
occupied 
almost 
exclusively 
the 
attention 
of 
historians. 
The 
means 
by 
which 
those 
events 
were 
produced 
were 
considered 
as 
of 
lesser 
importance. 


So 
far, 
however, 
as 
the 
present 
inquiry 
can 
be 
elucidated, 
although 
materials 
are 
few, 
yet, 
by 
adhering 
to 
a 
distinct 
plan, 
and 
keeping 
the 
object 
always 
before 
us, 
we 
may 
arrive 
at 
a 
conclusion. 


The 
countries 
that 
appear 
to 
have 
been 
first 
inhabited 
were 
Syria 
and 
Egypt, 
{23} 
both 
of 
them 
situated 
on 
the 
borders 
of 
the 
Mediterranean 
Sea; 
and 
as 
early 
as 
any 
authentic 
records 
extend, 
those 
were 
great 
and 
powerful 
countries 
in 
which 
agriculture 
and 
population 
had 
made 
great 
progress, 
and 
into 
which 
commerce 
had 
already 
brought 
many 
of 
the 
luxuries 
of 
the 
East. 


The 
Phoenicians, 
a 
people 
differing 
in 
name 
from 
those 
who 
were 
subjected 
to 
the 
Assyrian 
monarchs, 
occupied 
that 
part 
of 
Syria, 
now 
called 
the 
Levant, 
directly 
on 
the 
borders 
of 
the 
Mediterranean 
Sea; 
they 
were 
the 
first 
who 
rose 
to 
wealth 
and 
power 
by 
arts 
and 
com


{23} 
Reasons 
have 
been 
given 
in 
the 
preface 
for 
not 
taking 
any 
view 
of 
the 
situation 
of 
India, 
though, 
by 
its 
produce, 
it 
appears, 
at 
least 
of 
equal 
antiquity.

Tyre 
and 
Sidon 
were 
the 
abodes 
of 
commerce 
long 
before 
the 
arrival 
of 
the 
Jews 
in 
the 
land 
of 
Canaan, 
situated 
in 
the 
adjacent 
country, 
with 
whom, 
in 
the 
days 
of 
David 
and 
Solomon, 
the 
Phoenicians 



were 
on 
terms 
of 
friendship 
and 
alliance, 
{24} 
assisting 
the 
latter 
to 
carry 
on 
commerce, 
and 
enrich 
his 
people. 
(See 
Appendix 
B.) 
=sic 
there 
is 
none= 


The 
whole 
coast 
of 
the 
Mediterranean 
lay 
open 
to 
them 
for 
navigation, 
as 
did 
also 
the 
Grecian 
islands, 
and 
as 
their 
own 
soil 
was 
barren, 
they 
purchased 
the 
necessaries 
of 
life, 
giving 
in 
exchange 
the 
rich 
stuffs 
they 
had 
manufactured, 
and 
the 
produce 
of 
the 
East 
of 
which 
they 
almost 
exclusively 
possessed 
the 
commerce. 


The 
Egyptians 
were 
possessed 
of 
the 
most 
fertile 
soil 
in 
the 
world, 
bounded 
by 
the 
Mediterranean 
Sea 
on 
the 
north, 
and 
on 
the 
east 
and 
west 
by 
barren 
deserts. 
Their 
country 
was 
of 
a 
triangular 
form, 
and 
watered 
by 
the 
Nile, 
which, 
passing 
through 
it 
in 
its 
greatest 
extent, 
runs 
nearly 
down 
the 
middle. 


Thus 
situated, 
in 
the 
country 
depending 
on 
the 
Nile 
for 
its 
fertility, 
and 
on 
all 
sides 
protected 
from 
enemies, 
it 
was 
exceedingly 
natural 
to 
cultivate 
the 
arts 
of 
peace, 
and 
it 
was 
not 
possible 
that 
it 
should 
be 
divided 
into 
many 
different 
nations, 
as 
in 
other 
countries 
in 
early 
times 
was 
the 
case, 
when 
sovereignty 
rose 
from 
parental 
authority, 
and 
when 
there 
was 
no 
natural 
bond 
between 
the 
heads 
of 
different 
families. 


The 
great 
abundance 
with 
which 
the 
inhabitants 
were 
supplied, 
in 
years 
when 
the 
Nile 
overflowed 
in 
a 
favourable 
manner, 
and 
the 
uncertainty 
of 
future 
plenty 
were 
inducements 
for 
accumulation 
and 
foresight, 
which 
are 
not 
equally 
necessary 
in 
countries 
where 
the 
important 
circumstances 
of 
plenty 
or 
want 
do 
not 
depend 
on 
one 
single 
event 
over 
the 
whole 
face 
of 
a 
country, 
separated, 
besides, 
from 
others 
by 
a 
sea, 
which 
they 
could 
not 
navigate, 
and 
by 
deserts 
not 
very 
easy 
to 
pass 
over. 


The 
difficulties 
of 
transporting 
corn, 
which 
were 
sufficient 
to 
deter 
the 
Egyptians 
from 
depending 
on 
a 
supply 
from 
other 
parts, 
did 
not, 
however, 
prevent 
other 
nations 
from 
applying 
to 
them 
in 
times 
of 
scarcity, 
and 
accordingly 
it 
was 
the 
granary 
of 
the 
ancient 



world.

To 
those 
natural 
advantages, 
the 
Egyptians 
added 
some 
others, 
different 
in 
their 
nature, 
but 
not 
less 
precious. 


They 
enjoyed 
a 
mild 
government, 
and 
an 
admirable 
and 
simple 
code 
of 
laws. 
Their 
docility 
and 
obedience 
have 
never 
been 
equalled, 
and 
as 
one 
maxim, 
was, 
to 
admit 
of 
no 
person 
being 
idle, 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
the 
population 
must 
have 
increased 
rapidly, 
and 
that 
there 
must 
have 
been 
an 
impossibility 
to 
employ 
the 
whole 
labour 
of 
so 
many 
hands 
on 
the 
means 
of 
providing 
subsistence 
in 
a 
country, 
where 
the 
manners 
were 
simple, 
the 
soil 
fertile, 
and 
the 
wants 
few. 


The 
surplus 
of 
the 
industry 
of 
Egypt 
appears 
to 
have 
been 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
the 
sovereigns 
to 
whom 
all 
the 
lands 
belonged, 
and 
for 
which 
they 
exacted 
a 
rent 
in 
kind, 
as 
is 
the 
custom 
among 
the 
native 
powers 
on 
both 
peninsulas 
of 
India 
to 
this 
day. 
By 
that 
means, 
they 
were 
enabled 
to 
produce 
those 
stupendous 
works 
which 
have 
been 
the 
admiration 
and 
wonder 
of 
all 
succeeding 
generations, 
and 
of 
every 
nation. 
The 
city 
of 
Thebes, 
with 
the 
labyrinth; 
Memphis, 
the 
canals, 
and 
the 
pyramids 
would 
all 
be 
incredible, 
had 
not 
their 
singular 
structure 
preserved 
those 
latter 
efforts 
of 
industry 
from 
the 
ravages 
of 
time, 
and 
left 
them 
nearly 
entire 
to 
the 
present 
day. 


The 
Phoenicians 
were 
a 
colony 
from 
that 
great 
country; 
for 
the 
Egyptians 
in 
general 
had 
a 
dislike 
to 
the 
sea. 
It 
is 
well 
known, 
however, 
that 
people 
who 
live 
immediately 
on 
the 
coast 
have 
a 
propensity 
to 
navigation, 
and 
it 
is 
probable 
that 
those 
Egyptians 
who 
left 
their 
own 
fruitful 
land 
to 
settle 
on 
the 
barren 
borders 
of 
Syria, 
were 
from 



the 
delta 
of 
Lower 
Egypt, 
which 
lies 
on 
the 
sea 
coast, 
and 
is 
intersected 
by 
a 
number 
of 
branches 
of 
the 
river 
Nile. 
{25} 


It 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
such 
a 
colony, 
following 
the 
natural 
propensity 
to 
naval 
affairs, 
and 
carrying 
with 
it 
the 
arts 
of 
dying 
and 
weaving, 
together 
with 
whatever 
else 
the 
Egyptians 
knew, 
should 
become 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
necessity, 
and 
in 
a 
favourable 
situation 
for 
arts 
and 
commerce, 
as 
much 
celebrated 
for 
commercial 
riches, 
as 
their 
mother 
country 
had 
long 
been 
for 
agriculture 
and 
the 
cultivation 
of 
the 
sciences. 


{25} 
That 
the 
Phoenicians 
were 
from 
Egypt 
is 
not 
doubted, 
and 
their 
becoming 
a 
totally 
different 
people 
from 
being 
on 
a 
different 
soil 
and 
in 
a 
different 
situation, 
is 
a 
strong 
proof 
of 
the 
influence 
of 
physical 
circumstances 
on 
the 
characters 
of 
nations.

Tyre 
accordingly 
is 
the 
first 
example 
of 
a 
city 
becoming 
rich 
and 
powerful 
by 
arts 
and 
commerce, 
and 
though 
few 
details 
are 
known, 
yet 
those 
are 
of 
a 
very 
decided 
character. 


The 
pride 
of 
the 
Tyrians 
appears 
to 
have 
been 
the 
cause 
of 
their 
fall, 
and 
that 
pride 
was 
occasioned 
by 
the 
possession 
of 
wealth, 
far 
beyond 
that 
of 
any 
other 
people 
then 
in 
the 
world. 
While 
they 
were 
great 
they 
aimed 
at 
monopoly, 
and 
were 
partly 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
rapid 
decay 
of 
Jerusalem. 
After 
the 
death 
of 
Solomon, 
they 
founded 
a 
colony, 
well 
situated 
for 
the 
extention 
of 
their 
own 
trade, 
which 
consisted 
chiefly 
in 
bringing 
the 
rich 
produce 
of 
Arabia, 
and 
India, 
into 
the 
western 
world. 
Carthage 
was 
placed 
on 
the 
south 
coast 
of 
the 
Mediterranean 
to 
the 
west 
of 
Egypt, 
so 
as 
never 
to 
have 
any 
direct 
intercourse 
with 
India 
itself, 
while 
it 
lay 
extremely 
well 
for 
distributing 
the 
merchandize, 
brought 
by 
the 
Tyrians, 
from 
thence 
in 
the 
interior 
of 
Africa, 
Spain, 
Sicily, 
Italy, 
and 
the 
parts

From 
the 
extent 
of 
its 
territory 
and 
situation, 
Tyre 
could 
only 
be 
wealthy; 
it 
never 
could 
be 
powerful, 
as 
the 
great 
Assyrian 
monarchy, 
which 
lay 
immediately 
to 
the 
eastward, 
prevented 
the 
possibility 
of 
its 
extention; 
and, 
as 
to 
power 
at

there 
was

at 
that

the 
most 
then 
that 
could 
be 
expected 
was, 
that 
it 
should 
have 
sufficient 
strength 
to 
protect 
itself, 
which, 
being 
on 
a 
small 
island, 
very 
near 
the

was 
not 
difficult.

Tyre 
could 
never

been

some 
other

nicated 
with 
the 
eastern 
part 
of 
Asia, 
by 
the 
river 
Euphrates, 
and 
by 
the 
Persian 
Gulf 
with 
India, 
was, 
as 
Memphis, 
of 
Egypt, 
a 
capital; 
but 
the 
Assyrians 
were 
not 
protected 
on 
all 
sides, 
like 
the 
Egyptians, 
from 
foreign 
inroads; 
they 
consequently 
did 
not 
cultivate 
the 
arts 
of 
peace 
and 
the 
sciences 
so 
much. 
On 
the 
east, 
were 
the 
Medes 
and 
Persians; 
on 
the 



north, 
the 
Scythians 
and 
Partheans; 
but, 
as 
the 
territory 
was 
fertile 
and 
extensive, 
under 
one 
of 
the 
finest 
climates 
of 
the 
world, 
the 
monarchs 
became 
rich 
and 
luxurious, 
which 
was 
the 
cause 
of 
their 
subjection, 
and 
they 
were 
always 
subdued 
by 
people 
less 
advanced 
in 
luxury 
than 
themselves. 


The 
whole 
of 
these 
countries, 
Egypt, 
Syria, 
Phoenicia, 
and 
Greece, 
fell 
under 
the 
arms 
of 
Alexander. 
This 
was 
the 
first 
great 
and 
general 
revolution 
in 
that 
part 
of 
the 
world, 
from 
which 
Carthage 
alone, 
of 
all 
the 
ancient 
seats 
of 
wealth 
and 
greatness, 
escaped. 


The 
triumph 
of 
Alexander 
was, 
no 
doubt, 
that 
of 
a 
great 
captain; 
but, 
except 
the 
destruction 
of 
Tyre, 
and 
the 
foundation 
of 
Alexandria, 
which 
changed 
the 
principal 
seat 
of 
commerce, 
there 
was 
nothing 
durable 
in 
his 
conquests. 
The 
reigning 
families 
were 
destroyed, 
and 
the 
dynasties 
altered; 
but, 
under 
his 
immediate 
successors, 
the 
Egyptians, 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
Syria, 
and 
the 
Greeks, 
had 
different 
masters. 


It 
was 
after 
the 
foundation 
of 
Alexandria, 
and 
under 
the 
successors 
of 
Alexander, 
that 
Egypt 
became 
really 
a 
commercial 
country. 
Its 
wealth 
had 
hitherto 
arisen 
rather 
from 
the 
great 
population 
and 
fertility 
of 
the 
country, 
than 
from 
any 
participation 
in 
the 
trade 
to 
the 
East; 
but 
after 
Alexandria 
was 
founded, 
the 
seat 
of 
empire, 
which 
had 
always 
been 
in 
Upper 
Egypt, 
was 
established 
in 
Lower 
Egypt, 
canals 
were 
dug, 
and 
every 
means 
taken 
to 
make 
the 
passage 
from 
the 
Red 
Sea 
to 
the 
Mediterranean 
as 
commodious 
as 
possible. 


Carthage 
began 
then 
to 
decline. 
Tyre 
was 
no 
more: 
and 
Alexandria 
was 
situated 
on 
the 
same 
side 
of 
the 
Mediterranean 
Sea, 
in 
a 
much 
more 
advantageous 
position 
for 
receiving 
the 
productions 
of 
the 
East, 
and 
equally 
advantageous 
for 
distributing 
them. 


The 
Phoenicians 
never 
recovered 
their 
importance; 
and 
indeed 
it 
was 
not 
the 
interest 
of 
the 
Persian 
monarch 
to 
encourage 
trade 
by 
[end 
of

#24] 
the 
old 
channel 
of 
the 
Red 
Sea 
and 
Rhinocolura, 
but 
rather 
to 
come 
directly 
through 
the 
Persian 
Gulf, 
ascend 
the 



Euphrates, 
and 
cross 
the 
country 
to 
the 
borders 
of 
the 
Mediterranean, 
which 
was 
a 
way 
not 
much 
more 
expensive 
than 
by 
the 
old 
rout 
=sic=. 
As 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
produce 
imported 
was 
to 
be 
consumed 
at 
the 
luxurious 
court 
of 
Persia, 
and 
in 
the 
numerous 
rich 
cities 
with 
which 
that 
empire 
was 
filled, 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
the 
way 
by 
the 
Persian 
Gulf 
was 
by 
much 
the 
least 
expensive; 
for 
even 
Solomon, 
King 
of 
Jerusalem, 
long 
before, 
though 
he 
lived 
at 
one 
extremity 
of 
the 
journey, 
and 
had 
ships 
for 
trading 
by 
the 
other 
channel, 
had 
carried 
on 
trade 
by 
this 
way; 
and, 
in 
order 
to 
facilitate 
it, 
had 
laid 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
magnificent 
city 
of 
Palmyra, 
nearly 
in 
the 
middle 
between 
the 
Mediterranean 
Sea 
and 
the 
Gulf 
of 
Persia. 


Whilst 
those 
revolutions 
were 
effecting 
amongst 
the 
ancient 
nations 
on 
the 
continents 
of 
Asia 
and 
Africa, 
the 
Greeks, 
who 
had 
been 
the 
most 
barbarous 
of 
all, 
became, 
by 
degrees, 
the 
most 
refined; 
their 
learning 
and 
arts 
were 
all 
founded, 
originally, 
on 
the 
Egyptian 
learning; 
and 
though 
at 
last 
they 
carried 
them 
to 
a 
higher 
pitch 
than 
their 
masters; 
yet 
Egypt, 
for 
many 
centuries, 
was 
looked 
up 
to, 
even 
by 
the 
Greeks, 
as 
they 
were 
afterwards 
for 
a 
number 
of 
centuries 
by 
the 
Romans, 
and 
the 
other 
nations 
of 
the 
world. 


The 
education 
of 
the 
Greeks; 
very 
different 
in 
some 
of 
the 
states 
from 
what 
it 
was 
in 
others, 
had, 
however, 
the 
same 
tendency 
in 
all; 
that 
tendency 
was 
to 
invigorate 
the 
body, 
and 
instruct 
and 
strengthen 
the 
mind. 
While 
this 
continued, 
we 
see 
them 
at 
first 
resist 
the 
Persians, 
though 
in 
very 
unequal 
numbers; 
and, 
at 
last, 
the 
Grecian 
vigour, 
discipline, 
and 
skill, 
subdue 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
then 
civilized 
world. 


After 
the 
conquests 
of 
Alexander, 
the 
wealth 
and 
luxury 
of 
Asia 
were 
introduced 
into 
Greece, 
and 
indeed 
the 
Greeks 
refined 
on 
that 
luxury. 
At 
Athens 
and 
the 
other 
cities 
which 
might 
be 
said 
to 
give 
manners 
to 
the 
rest, 
shews, 
and 
theatrical 
representations 
were 
after 
that 
more 
attended 
to 
than 
the 
military 
art; 
and 
cabal, 
intrigue, 
and 
corruption, 
were 
introduced 
in 
the 
place 
of 
that 
manly, 
pure, 
and 
admirable 
love 
of 
their 
country, 
for 
which, 
in 
less 
wealthy, 
but 
in 
better 
[end

times, 
they 
had 
been 
so 
highly 
distinguished 
above 



every 
other 
people. 


This 
was 
the 
situation 
of 
things 
when 
a 
nation, 
less 
advanced 
in 
arts, 
and 
uncorrupted 
with 
the 
possession 
of 
wealth, 
but 
which 
was 
still 
considered 
by 
the 
Greeks 
as 
barbarous, 
prepared 
at 
once 
to 
subdue 
the 
whole 
of 
them, 
and 
give 
a 
still 
more 
striking 
proof 
of 
the 
triumph 
which 
vigour 
and 
energy 
obtain 
over 
those 
who 
have 
only 
wealth; 
the 
possession 
of 
which, 
undoubtedly, 
gives 
a 
certain 
means 
of 
defence, 
though 
one 
very 
unequal 
to 
resisting 
a 
nation 
when 
excited 
by 
the 
desire 
of 
sharing 
its 
possessions, 
and 
yet 
vigorous 
and 
strong, 
not 
being 
unnerved 
by 
the 
enjoyment 
of 
ease 
and 
luxury.

CHAP. 
IV. 


Of 
the 
Romans. 
--the 
Causes 
of 
their 
Rise 
under 
the 
Republic, 
and 
of 
their 
Decline 
under 
the 
Emperors. 
--the 
great 
Error 
generally 
fallen 
into 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
Comparison 
between 
Rome 
and 
Carthage; 
Proofs 
that 
it 
is 
wrong, 
and 
not 
at 
all 
applicable 
to 
France 
and 
England. 


IN 
the 
rise 
and 
greatness 
of 
Rome, 
there 
was 
nothing 
accidental, 
all 
was 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
most 
unremitting 
perseverance 
in 
a 
plan, 
at 
first, 
of 
petty 
robbery; 
which, 
as 
it 
extended, 
was 
honoured 
with 
the 
title 
of 
conquest; 
and, 
as 
it 
succeeded, 
has 
been 
considered 
as 
deserving 
the 
appellation 
of 
great. 


It 
is 
true, 
that 
there 
were 
talents 
exercised, 
and 
methods 
practised, 
which 
deserve 
the 
highest 
praise, 
and 
are 
worthy 
of 
imitation. 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
withhold 
admiration 
at 
the 
recital, 
but 
the 
end 
in 
view, 
from 
the 
beginning, 
cannot 
be 
justified. 


Although 
neither 
the 
end 
in 
view, 
nor, 
generally 
speaking, 
the 
means 
employed, 
are 
deserving 
of 
imitation, 
yet 
we 
shall 
find 
more 
advantage 
from 
examining 
them 
than 
from 
the 
history 
of 
any 



other 
nation. 


In 
the 
first 
place, 
so 
far 
as 
prosperity 
depends 
on 
good 
conduct, 
and 
good 
conduct 
depends 
on 
the 
state 
of 
the 
mind, 
the 
Romans 
are 
a 
most 
striking 
example. 
While 
they 
preserved 
the 
manners 
that 
first 
occasioned 
their 
rise, 
they 
continued 
to 
become 
more 
powerful; 
as 
they 
forsook 
these 
manners, 
their 
power 
abandoned 
them; 
and 
they, 
after 
having 
conquered 
all 
with 
whom 
they 
ever 
contended, 
because 
they 
had 
more 
skill 
or 
less 
corruption, 
were 
themselves 
overcome, 
by 
men 
infinitely 
inferior 
to 
what 
they 
had 
been, 
before 
they 
became 
enervated 
and 
corrupt. 


The 
smallness 
of 
the 
territory, 
which 
the 
Romans 
at 
first 
possessed, 
laid 
them 
under 
the 
necessity 
of 
extending 
it, 
and 
drawing 
resources 
from 
their 
neighbours; 
who, 
being 
brave 
and 
hardy, 
could 
not 
be 
easily 
either 
robbed 
or 
subdued. 
[end 
of 
page 
#27] 


The 
Romans 
began 
with 
robbing, 
and 
finished 
with 
subduing 
them 
all, 
but 
the 
modes 
they 
practised 
deserve 
attention. 


It 
is 
in 
vain 
to 
think 
that 
superior 
bravery 
or 
skill 
would 
alone 
have 
done 
the 
business; 
those 
are 
often 
triumphant, 
but 
occasionally 
defeated. 
The 
Romans 
owed 
their 
gradual 
aggrandizement 
to 
a 
line 
of 
conduct 
that, 
whether 
in 
good 
or 
ill 
fortune, 
tended 
to 
make 
them 
the 
sovereigns 
of 
the 
world. 
A 
line 
of 
conduct 
in 
which, 
if 
it 
had 
been 
in 
human 
nature 
to 
persevere, 
they 
would 
have 
preserved 
the 
situation 
to 
which 
they 
had 
elevated 
themselves. 


Along 
with 
this 
decided 
conduct, 
which 
seems 
to 
have 
arisen 
from 
something 
innate 
in 
themselves, 
or 
to 
have 
been 
occasioned 
by 
some 
circumstance 
that 
is 
not 
known, 
the 
Romans 
possessed 
a 
number 
of 
methods, 
in 
addition 
to 
personal 
bravery, 
by 
which 
they 
advanced 
the 
end 
they 
had 
in 
view. 


When 
the 
kings 
were 
abolished, 
Rome 
was 
only 
a 
small, 
rude, 
irregular 
place, 
and 
a 
receptacle 
for 
plunder; 
inhabited, 
however, 
by 
men 
who 
had 
great 
strength 
of 
mind, 
and 
who 
possessed 
a 
great 



command 
over 
themselves. 


Their 
moral 
code 
was 
suitable 
to 
their 
situation. 
To 
rob, 
plunder, 
and 
destroy 
an 
enemy 
was 
a 
merit; 
to 
betray 
a 
trust, 
or 
to 
defraud 
a 
fellow 
citizen, 
was 
a 
crime 
of 
the 
greatest 
magnitude. 
With 
the 
Romans, 
oaths 
were 
inviolable; 
and 
attachment 
to 
the 
public 
was 
the 
greatest 
virtue. 


As 
they 
had 
neither 
arts 
nor 
commerce, 
and 
but 
very 
little 
territory, 
plunder 
was 
their 
means 
of 
subsistence; 
it 
was 
to 
them 
a 
regular 
source 
of 
wealth, 
and 
it 
was 
distributed 
with 
perfect 
impartiality; 
they 
were 
in 
fact 
an 
association; 
the 
wealth 
of 
the 
public, 
and 
of 
the 
individual, 
were, 
to 
a 
certain 
degree, 
the 
same; 
they 
were 
as 
an 
incorporated 
company, 
in 
which 
private 
interest 
conspired 
with 
the 
love 
of 
their 
country 
to 
forward 
the 
general 
interest. 


Plundering 
and 
pillage, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
modes 
of 
dividing 
the 
spoil, 
were 
reduced 
to 
system 
and 
method; 
and 
the 
religious 
observation 
of 
oaths 
was 
conducive 
to 
the 
success 
of 
both. 
Every 
soldier 
was 
sworn 
to 
be 
faithful 
to 
his 
country, 
both 
in 
fighting 
its 
battles, 
and 
in 
giving 
a 
rigid 
account 
of 
whatever 
might 
be 
the 
fruits 
of 
the 
contest.

The 
moveables 
and 
lands 
taken 
from 
an 
enemy 
were 
sold 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
public; 
the 
former 
went 
wholly 
for 
that 
purpose, 
and 
the 
latter 
were 
divided 
into 
two 
equal 
portions; 
one 
of 
which, 
like 
the 
moveables, 
went 
into 
the 
general 
stock, 
the 
other 
was 
distributed 
to 
the 
poorer 
citizens, 
at 
the 
price 
of 
a 
small 
acknowledgement. 


The 
consequence 
of 
this 
system 
was, 
a 
perpetual 
state 
of 
warfare; 
in 
which 
it 
was 
clear 
that 
the 
armies 
must 
obtain 
a 
superiority 
over 
neighbours, 
who 
but 
occasionally 
employed 
themselves 
in 
acts 
of 
hostility. 


From 
such 
a 
plan 
of 
operations 
it 
naturally 
followed 
that 
they 
must 
either 
have 
been 
subdued 
altogether, 
or 
come 
off 
in 
general 
with 
some 
advantage, 
otherwise 
it 
would 
have 
been 
impossible 
to 



proceed. 
Of 
this 
they 
seem 
to 
have 
been 
fully 
sensible; 
for, 
with 
them, 
it 
was 
a 
maxim 
never 
to 
conclude 
peace 
unless 
they 
were 
victorious, 
and 
never 
to 
treat 
with 
an 
enemy 
on 
their 
own 
territory. 


Acting 
in 
this 
manner, 
and 
engaging 
in 
wars 
with 
different 
nations, 
unconnected 
with 
each 
other 
by 
treaties 
of 
alliance; 
without 
any 
common 
interest, 
or 
even 
any 
knowledge 
of 
each 
others 
=sic= 
affairs; 
ignorant, 
in 
general, 
even 
of 
what 
was 
going 
on, 
the 
Romans 
had, 
in 
most 
cases, 
a 
great 
advantage 
over 
those 
with 
whom 
they 
had 
to 
contend. 


There 
were 
in 
Italy 
some 
very 
warlike 
people, 
and 
those 
were 
nearest 
to 
Rome 
itself. 
The 
contest 
with 
those 
was 
long 
obstinate, 
and 
repeatedly 
renewed; 
but 
still 
the 
system 
of 
conquest 
was 
followed; 
and 
at 
last 
prevailed. 


The 
consular 
government 
was 
favourable, 
also, 
for 
perpetual 
warfare. 
Those 
temporary 
chief 
magistrates 
did 
not 
enjoy 
their 
dignity 
long 
enough 
to 
become 
torpid 
or 
careless, 
but 
were 
interested 
in 
distinguishing 
themselves 
by 
the 
activity 
of 
their 
conduct 
while 
in 
office; 
whereas, 
in 
hereditary 
power, 
or 
elective 
monarchy, 
the 
personal 
feelings 
of 
the 
chief, 
which 
must 
have 
an 
influence 
upon 
the 
conduct 
of 
a 
nation, 
must 
sometimes, 
happily 
for 
mankind, 
lead 
him 
to 
seek 
peace 
and 
quietness.

During 
the 
interruption 
of 
consular 
government, 
by 
the 
decemvirs, 
though 
they 
did 
not 
reign 
long, 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
people 
was 
suspended, 
and 
their 
enemies 
found 
them 
much 
less 
difficult 
to 
resist.

Even 
when 
the 
Gauls 
burned 
the 
city, 
the 
Romans 
yielded 
no 
advantages 
in 
treaty; 
they 
abandoned 
it 
to 
its 
fate, 
retired 
to 
Veii,

renewed 
the
