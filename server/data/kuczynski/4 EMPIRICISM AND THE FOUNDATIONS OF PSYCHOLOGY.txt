Q A 
paraperception is sub-personal truth-awareness embodied in personal object- awareness. The delight one takes in listening to a Bach fugue embodies subpersonal awareness of truths about the structural properties of the sounds one is hearing, and those subpersonal awarenesses are expressed at the personal level in the form of phenomenological episodes. 
We've made heavy use of the assumption that there is such a thing as subpersonal mentation. It is now time to discharge this assumption.

Q A 
ultimately, de-repression does involve the movement in propria persona of the repressed conceit into consciousness. 
But subpersonal knowledge is never transferred from one mental stratum to another. By reading Chomsky and Marr, I acquire conscious knowledge of the subpersonal knowledge they describe. But the former is merely an analogue of the latter. Also, whereas the conscious conceit implanted by the psychoanalyst in the mind of the patient is qualitatively identical with the corresponding represed conceit, the subpersonal knowledge described by Chomsky et al. is qualitatively very different from its conscious analogues. That conscious knowledge is not a bona fide duplicate, but a conceptualization, of the corresponding subpersonal knowledge. The former is schematic and theoretical, like our knowledge of the nature and behavior of electrons. By contrast, the conceit that the psychoanalyst implants in his patient's consciousness is a bona fide duplicate of its repressed counterpart. Both conceits consist of the very same concepts (hatred, father, etc.), arranged in the very same way. Those conceits differ only in the (numerical, as opposed to qualitative) sense in which my knowledge that 1 + 1 = 2 differs from your knowledge of that fact. 
2.0 Some, e.g. Searle (1992, 1994, 2004), argue that sub-personal processes are strictly physiological; they embody no intelligence; they are purely reflexive. 
This view is indefensible. You hear a long sentence of your native tongue. You've

Q A 
never before heard that sentence or one much like it. But you understand it. Let's start 
with those facts. 
The English language is a collection of rules. The simplest ones have the form: x refers to y. Most such rules are not so straightforward. But even those that have the form x refers to y have a rather complicated form. To say that 
"x refers to y" 
is to say that 
in virtue of having the form "........,” a given sentence is true just in 
case...y... 
So to say that "Socrates" refers to some object O is to say that, in virtue of having the form "Aristotle admired Socrates,” a given sentence means that Aristotle admired O. In fact, even this definition of what it is for x to refer to y is incomplete, given that not all sentences are in the indicative mood. A more accurate definition would be: 
x refers to y exactly if, in virtue of having the form "......" a sentence encodes a proposition (not necessarily one that it affirms) to the effect that...y... Thus semantic rules of the form x refers to y are highly complex, and any semantic rule of any other kind is even more complex. Consider the word "because." It won't do to say that "because" picks out a relation of some kind. The statement "John is tall because John ate lots of vegetables as a child" isn't synonymous with "John is tall, the relation that P bears to Q if P is a consequence of Q, John ate lots of vegetables as a

complicated. 
Q A 
And yet people absorb and apply these rules without the slightest difficulty. Any given instances of such linguistic competence is naturally characterized as a case of somebody's having a mastery of such and such semantic rules. Supposing such characterizations to be correct, the rules in question are not access-conscious, and they're obviously not access-unconscious in the same way as your antipathy towards your best friend. So either they're access unconscious in some deeper sense or they don't exist. Those who take the latter view have to say that there is a physiological characterization of our linguistic competence. But this is not a viable view, as we're 
about 
to see. 
2.1 Having heard the sentence, "either Julie will be coming to the party tonight or Mary won't let us go for a boat ride with her," you understand what you have heard, and you do so instantaneously and flawlessly. But if you're like me, you can't give a creditable definition of even one of that sentence's constituents. 
Also, were you to have conscious, discursive knowledge of the meanings of "or" etc., that knowledge wouldn't operate quickly enough for it to result in your hearing meaning in the noises mediating the relevant occurrence of "either Julie will be

that mentality and conscousness are identical. 
Q A 
It is inherent in what propositional attitudes are that they cannot be constituents of consciousness and, therefore, that, when they are "conscious,” it is in the sense that they are access-conscious. And there is no a priori reason why anything that is accessconscious must be so. This follows from the fact that there is nothing of which one is conscious of which one must be conscious. Any given consciousness must be distinct from its object - the two must not be numerically identical and neither must be a constituent of the other. Distinct objects are ipso facto such that the existence of the one is not logically dependent (though it may be causally dependent) on the 
existence of the other. 
In any case, to make a more modest claim, for which more specific grounds will presently be cited, there is no a priori reason why propositional attitudes must be access-conscious. I believe that Greenland is larger than Iceland. I've believed that for years. But it wasn't until a moment ago that my consciousness accessed it. 
Why is it incoherent to suppose that my consciousness might have trouble accessing a given a propositional attitude? Your IBM sometimes has trouble accessing its own contents. You lose a document. You do a search. You can't find the document. But it's there, that being why the FBI has forensic computer-specialists. Why is it so absurd to assume that, on occasion, your mind is similarly incapable of retrieving information buried within its recesses?

Q A 
Also, it often takes considerable intellectual resources to be consciously aware of just what it is one believes. Brown believes that Smith is a liar. Brown believes this because he has other beliefs, e.g. Brown believes (because he knows) that Smith's smiles, and his facial gestures in general, lack the muscular accompaniments that they would have if they were sincere; that Smith is oddly unresponsive to data that, were he telling the truth, would be cause for intense joy or intense distress; etc. 
Supposing that none of these beliefs is repressed, will Brown necessarily be automatically aware that he has them? It seems that, even if these various beliefs are accessconscious - in other words, even if they aren't repressed or otherwise withdrawn from his consciousness - there's a good chance that Brown doesn't have the wherewithal to conceptualize them properly or, therefore, to know that he has them. 
My visual perception of the contents of my room is obviously conscious. It's conscious in every sense of the word. But, because I have no artistic talent, I couldn't produce a visual representation of that representation. 
It's one thing to have the cognitive wherewithal to have a first-order representation, e.g. a perception, or a belief that doesn't itself concern a belief. It's quite another to have the cognitive wherewithal to correctly conceive of that cognitive wherewithal. And without such meta-cognitive wherewithal, one can't know what one's propositional attitudes are.

SV is logically false. SV# isn't logically false. But it's false, as we'll now see. 
Searle's contention that: 
(MC127) Mentality is identical with consciousness 
entails that 
(MC#) Whatever is a part of your mind, but not of your consciousness, exists only qua disposition on your part to have conscious experiences of a certain kind. 
And, taken in conjunction with the fact that 
(AD) Any dispositions that you have are mediated by physiological structures, 
MC also entails that: 
< 
144/476 
Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
Q A 
(MC*) Any such disposition is identical with, or mediated by, a physiological structure of some kind. 
Searle knows that MC entails MC#. So he accepts MC#, and he is thus a dispositionalist about non-consciousness-constitutive mental entities. So according to Searle, your belief that 1 + 1 = 2 is constituted by with your disposition to judge that Jim must have two cars, given that he has one car in Iowa and and one car in Nebraska and no other cars. (More accurately, it is, if Searle is right, constituted by your disposition to have the consciousness-constitutive concomitants of a judgment of the just-mentioned kind.) Of course, that one disposition isn't all there is to that belief. But the latter, Searle holds, is identical with that disposition plus innumerable 
other similar ones. 
Given his acceptance of MC, Searle has no choice but to take this view, and to take the same view mutatis mutandis of each one of a given person's propositional

So none of the information embodied in the pre-sleep belief-system did anything in the way of giving you a legitimate reason to believe that Smith is in the barn. Given obvious extensions of this reasoning, there is many a knowledge-constitutive belief K such that dispositionalism has the false consequence that K is nothing more than an arbitrary opinion. 
Given how widely accepted dispositionalism is, and how wrong it is, another illustration of its erroneousness is in order. 
I intend to be a Senator, and I'm currently running for that office. To win the election I need a tremendous amount of financial support. One day I hear that Company X, which had been financing my campaign, has decided to finance a rival candidate. I immediately become angry, fret about how to generate the needed revenue, and so on. According to the view in question, my intention to be a Senator is dead except upon my being stimulated in certain ways. But if that's so, why would P bolt into action under circumstances like the one just described? Why would my hearing the bad news about Company X result in P's being roused, and not some other physiological structure? How would I, or any part of my mind, know that I ought to respond to this bad news in a way characteristic of somebody who had an intention to be Senator? If,

functioning as such attitudes, we wouldn't have dispositions of the kind that the advocate of the dispositionalist view identifies with such states. The same is obviously true of all non-occurrent mental structures. They are functioning as mental entities in between bouts of generating consciousness-constitutive states and overt behaviors. 
4.0 Given only that each boy is liked by some girl, it doesn't follow that some girl likes each boy. In other words, given only that, for each boy x, there is some girl y such that y likes x, it doesn't follow that there is some girl y such that, for each boy x, y likes x. To think otherwise is to commit the so-called "quantifier-shift" fallacy. (In this case, the quantifiers in question are "for each boy x" and "there is some girl y.") 
SV# is guilty of that fallacy. Suppose that, for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), there is some rule R1 such that act A, accords with R1. It doesn't follow that there is some one rule R1, such that, for any i, A, accords with R1. 
To be sure, if n is finite, we can always contrive some rule, if only a patently artificial one, with respect to which each of A1... A is complying with R*. But there are infinitely many sentences that you understand. There are infinitely many (derived, not primitive) semantic rules. Ceteris paribus two English speakers assign the same

meaningassignments agree with y's, but that this is no cause for alarm since 
physiologically it's no coincidence. 
Searle doesn't distinguish the statement that: 
(1) For any number n, it can be a coincidence that, for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), each of x and y assigns mi to s1. 
from the similar-seeming, but very different statement that: 
(2) It can be a coincidence that, for any number n, for each i, (1 ≤ i ≤ n) each of x and y assigns mi to s1. 
(1) is coherent. But (2) is incoherent. The statement: 
(3) for any n that you choose, no matter how high, each of x and y assigns meanings mi...m to si...s, respectively, 
is equivalent to: 
(4) for any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), it is a foregone conclusion that each of x and y will assign 
dy (i) There is some one body of semantic rules r,... such that each of x and y 
accepts r....r, and such that, assuming m, to be the meaning of s, (1 ≤i≤n), 
it is by virtue of his delineating the logical consequences of r... that each person takes s, to have m, for its meaning;

from the non-equivalent statement that: 
Q A 
(ii*) X-internal events are to be explained in terms of the same principles as Yinternal 
events. 
Just as Searle believes, cognitive processes are realized by physiological processes. But it doesn't follow, and it's a priori improbable, that the psychological relations between physiological events can be understood in physiological terms. 
Here we must remember the points made in Chapter 1, Sections 1.2.1-1.2.4. Qua punch-card automaton, Babbage's calculator is adding numbers. Qua heap of molecules, it's doing something else. Qua calculator, your calculator is doing the same thing as Babbage's machine. Qua heap of molecules it's doing something else. Considered in strictly physical terms, those two computing machines bear no resemblance to each other. Considered in functional terms, they are identical. 
This is not to say that calculators think: they do not. But the points just made are easily mapped onto physical structures that do mediate thought. Let M be the part of

sentencecollections are (relative to the constraints set by the syntactic rules of English), three conditions would have to be met: 
(a*) x's cognitive properties would have to be perfectly aligned with his physiological properties; 
(b*) The same would have to hold of y; 
(c*) The way in which x's physiological and cognitive properties were aligned would have to coincide with the way in which y's physiological and cognitive properties were aligned. 
The a priori likelihood of their psychologies being so perfectly aligned to their respective physiologies is small, and the actual likelihood is even smaller. 
We must also remember that medical science individuates brain-centers on the 
basis of their presumptive cognitive functions. So brain-physiology is not done innocently: it is done in light of our knowledge of psychophysical concomitances. In keeping with this tradition, we have defined M and B as those physiological structures that mediate Mozart's and Beethoven's respective musical competencies. This stacks the deck in Searle's favor. And yet, relative even to these Searle-friendly provisions, M and B differ physiologically much more different than they do cognitively.

Q A 
Hume grants that sentences like “Bill's throwing water on the Lucy is what caused her to wake up" are sometimes true. But he holds that such a sentence is true only if taken to say of some pair of spatiotemporally adjacent events that it instantiates a regularity. Such a statement is false, according to Hume, if taken to mean that some event disposed some other event to occur. 
130. Wittgenstein (1922), Ayer (1934), Frank (1949), Hempel (1965), Carnap (1966). 131. Like C. J. Ducasse (1969), I myself do not believe that empiricism is committed to the view that nothing makes anything happen, or therefore to the explanations of explanation to which that doctrine has given rise. But that view is one that view has always been a central component of empiricism. We will set aside the question of whether empiricism really is committed to that view and simply accept that empiricists have accepted that view.

2.0 There are many problems with HC. First of all, HC doesn't distinguish actual from epiphenomenal causality. 133 Let e1 be some event that causes both e2 and e3, which are otherwise mutually independent, and suppose that e2 immediately precedes and is adjacent with e3. In that case, HC has the false consequence that e2 causes e3. E.g.

Q A 
the rotation of the Earth with respect to Sun causes day to follow (and be adjacent with) night, etc. But day doesn't cause night. (Thomas Reid made this very point.) The agitated behavior of the farm animals immediately follows and (we may suppose) is adjacent with the jagged readings on the seismographs. But it's the incipient earthquake that causes both; the animals aren't responding to the seismographs- readings.134 
But this criticism is far from definitive, some will say:135 
(DH136) Time weeds out cases of pseudo-causation (also known as "epiphenomenal causation"), thereby distinguishing them from cases of bona fide causation. Earthquakes aren't always preceded by agitated behaviors on the part of animals or on the part of needles on seismographs. In other cases, where the pseudo-causal process is a bona fide concomitant of the actual causal process, the pseudo-causal process can be shown to be part of a more comprehensive genuinely causal process. DH doesn't adequately deal with the night-following-day problem, since, even if HA is supposed true, it has the false consequence that night causes day to follow. But there is a more important fact. We know that, if HA, is right, night causes day and vice versa. But we don't for a second let that fool us into thinking that night does in fact cause day. Our intuitions as to what causes what are not, evidently, what they would be if HA were correct (and our intuitions were hewed to it). 
As for the fact that many a pseudo-causal process (or kind of process) is ephemeral,

Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
Q A 
behavior of the needle on the seismograph, aren't responsible for the earthquake, even though they immediately precede/are adjacent with it (and their likes immediately precede/are adjacent with other, similar tectonic disturbances). We know this because any given case of pseudo-causation proves, on inspectionion, to involve discontinuities not involved in their real counterparts. constant conjunctions tip off us to continuities, to causal mechanisms. but it's the mechanism, the continuity, that is the sine qua non of causality, that being why there are confluences of events that are not related as cause and effect but that, if HA were right, would be so related. 
To the extent that an investigator's methodology is that of an empiricist, he is blind to anything that isn't either depicted or itself a depiction. The invisible is, for him, truly invisible. 
For this reason, empiricist philosophers of science, Hume being the first and the greatest such philosopher, deny that anything makes anything happen; and they deny, consequently, that anything disposes anything to happen. (x "disposes" y to happen iff x tends to make y happen.) They deny the existence of causes. 
First we know what causes what. Only then do we look for regularities. 
3.0 HA analyses causality in terms of space-time: e1 causes e, if e, immediately precedes and is adjacent with e2, and the sequence ex-e, instantiates a regularity.

our saying that x had gotten closer to y. Even if events ordinarily unknown to us because of interference effects are included in this statement, there would be no event that if (per impossibile) known would warrant a reappraisal of x's causal relation to y. 
Similar points hold with regard to the time-interval between two events. Let x and y be one pair of non-simultaneous events and let x* and y* be another such pair. If each of the intervals coincides with the other in respect of how many iterations of any given period process can occur during it; if ceteris paribus each the intervals coincides with the other in respect of how many how much energy is needed to keep a process going (e.g. a factory assembly line); if ceteris paribus in each coincides with the other respect of how much work must be done for an event starting with the first of the two events to have a given effect on the second event: if any of these conditions is met, there will be neither apparent nor actual grounds for supposing there to be a difference in length between the two intervals. 
There can be no spatiotemporal changes without causal changes. The reason: spatiotemporal changes are causal changes. 
Also, notions such as displacement and occupancy are to be understood in causal terms. To say that A has been moved from one place to another is to say nothing if it isn't to make a statement about how things have changed in respect of what would-be occupants of A's new place must do to occupy that place.

Q A 
3.0.1 The points just made enable us to a answer a difficult question: What exactly is wrong with Hume's answer to the question: On what basis is one justified in saying that x causes y? Hume's answer to this question, though false, is an extremely plausible one. First of all, it's partly right: just as Hume says, if x and y are disjoint, or y-like events sometimes fail to follow x-like events, then x cannot possibly be y's 
cause. 
But Hume's analysis is false. It's false because it makes a false assumption, and it's plausible because that assumption seems incontestable. 
That assumption: Changes consist of events. 
The truth: They don't. 
There are events, but the spatiotemporal world doesn't consist of them. 
More precisely: The spatiotemporal world obviously undergoes change, and any such change is an event; but such events are of a very different kind from those described by the statements in terms of which both scientists and laymen describe the world. 
Let us suppose for the time being that the external world consists of events and that those events correspond to the structures of true statements, such as (so we let us suppose) “John punched Fred." Events are discrete, isolable entities. They are to the 
< 
154/476 
Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
Q A 
of truths. The world consists of facts, not of truths – not, that is to say, of true propositions. Truths hold in virtue of facts, but are not identical with them. Events are nominalizations of truths. The event consisting of Smith's killing Brown is the 
nominalization of the truth that Smith killed Brown. 
A pig is thrown off a rooftop and it splatters upon hitting the ground. This process can't be atomized. It isn't like the whole-number series (0, 1, 2, ...). It isn't a sequence of any sort, and it therefore isn't a sequence of events. The redistributions of massenergy that constitute change do not have a digital structure. The world has an an analogue, not a digital structure. Hume's analysis assumes otherwise, and that is why it's wrong. 
Let ME be the the mass-energy displacement mediating the pig's being thrown off the rooftop and subsequently splattering. Observation not only doesn't represent ME as consisting of discrete parts; it represents it as not consisting of such parts; it represents, not as homogenous, but as seamless. 
It is only with considerable artifice that ME is represented as consisting of some event x and some adjacent event y such such that y-like events never fail to follow x- like events. But anyone witnessing ME knows that he is witnessing an instance of causation. Such a person knows this because he knows that he is witnessing an instance of continuity. 
So why does Hume counter-empirically attribute his having such knowledge to his 
< 
155/476 
Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
: Q A 
in space-time. Given an event E, each of its three spatial coordinates is given by a number, and so is its one time-coordinate. So E's space-time location is given by some ordered four-tuple of numbers.) Each statement falsely identifies articulations in our 
beliefs about the world with articulations in the world itself. So far as those beliefs are 
correct, the former articulations can be mapped onto the latter. But the mapping- relation isn't identical with the identity-relation. We will now justify this last claim; doing so will involve our repeating some points that we made a moment ago and that we justified in Chapter 1, Section 1.2.2. 
The world doesn't consist of truths; it consists of facts. Truths hold in virtue of facts, but they aren't identical with facts. Supposing that P were the shortest conjunction consisting of every truth, there would be no event E such that E's occurrence wasn't a logical consequence of P. (In this context, "event" is short for "event or state of affairs.") Given P, there is nothing about the universe that remains unsettled. But it would be a mistake to say, for that reason, that events were constituents of the world; and this mistake would not just resemble the one just cited, but would be a version of 
it. 
Smith has a stroke. Let E be that event; let R be the space-time region occupied by E, and let D be the mass-energy displacement(s) mediating E. Setting aside events that occupy proper sub-regions of R, more than one event has occurred in R. At least one biological, non-psychological event (E*) has occurred; and at least one physical,

Q A 
word, even if x and y are not identical.) Our only conceivable reason for distinguishing space-time regions R and R* is that one of those regions hosts, or could host, an event not hosted by the other; and our only reason for identifying those two regions is that neither hosts, or could host, an event not also hosted by the other. E's modal properties are different from E*'s. Supposing E and E* to be constituents of the external world, they are, by supposition, spatiotemporally coincident with each other. A consequence of that supposition, therefore, is that some region of space-time isn't self-identical. That supposition being an absurd one, the conclusion to draw is that events aren't constituents of the external world. This is no absurdity. It's a truism. For it is a corollary of the truism that true propositions (truths) are distinct from the facts in virtue of which they hold. We thus see the justification for our earlier claim that events are to be thought of, not as constituents of the external world, but as nominalizations of truths. (In the process of making a point distinct from the one we are currently making, Russell (1903) that the event of Caesar's being killed by Brutus is the nominalization of the truth that Brutus killed Caesar.) 
A consequence of our stipulating that 'E' and 'D' co-referred would therefore be that some region space-time wasn't identical with itself. Therefore, it is not a matter of convention that those expressions don't co-refer; it is a matter of substantive, albeit non-empirical fact. 
Hume's analysis of causation involves a failure to distinguish facts from truths. This

spatiotemporal changes are oftentimes thwarted by the causal changes associated with other spatiotemporal changes: the ball's movement towards me is thwarted by forces counteracting the changes in myself. We will leave it open whether all causal changes that don't involve relative changes in position can be identified with thwarted spatiotemporal changes in relative position. 
3.2 Hume assumes that the concepts of precedence in time and adjacency in space can be understood in non-causal terms. In making that assumption, he's assuming that a given event's space-time location isn't constituted by its optical and, more generally, causal relations to other events; and he is therefore assuming that there is some non- relational way of understanding space-time position. But there isn't, and his analysis of causality is therefore defective. 137 
In defense of Hume's position, a device known as the "Hume world" is used.138 This is a world in which the same events happen that happen in our world, in the same space-time order, but in which nothing makes anything happen. Such a world would be indistinguishable from ours, Humeans say, showing that there is no empirical foundation for the belief that we ourselves don't live in a Hume world or, therefore, that in our world anything makes anything happen. 
The problem is that this supposed Hume-world is replete with instances of causation. Any instance of persistence, or indeed of occupancy, is an instance of

and it therefore wouldn't exist at all. Suppose that B's state at t (Bt) isn't responsible to any degree for B's state at t* (Bt*). In that case, what grounds have we for saying that Bt and Bt* jointly constitute some one ball? Why not just say that B winked out of existence at t, to be replaced by some other ball at t*? 
Of course, given only that, were it not for causal ties, the ball wouldn't persist, it doesn't follow that, were it not for such ties, the ball wouldn't move along the surface of the pool table. But once it's granted that such ties exist, and consequently that it is coherent to posit such ties, it is an empirical question whether the ball's describing a given trajectory is to be explained in terms of them. And, the empirical data being what it is, that question is to be answered affirmatively. 
4.0 A transcendental argument for a proposition P is one to the effect that, unless P were true, it couldn't even be asked whether P were true. 139 What follows is a transcendental argument for the existence of instances of causation, that is, of things' making other things happen.

misapplication of empiricism. You say that instances of occupancy and persistence are ipso facto instances of causality. You also suggest that one sees instances of occupancy and persistence as instances of causation. I don't know whether you are right about this. But assuming for argument's sake that you are, an empirical conception of causality is the right one. For, relative to that assumption, we see instances of things making things happen, and we see them as such instances; so that, if we stick with what our senses tell us, we'll come to the right verdict - namely, that causality is compulsion, as opposed to regularity-instantiation.” 
Supposing this true, it follows that empiricism is incoherent. If questions about how to interpret our observations have to be settled before observational data can be logged, then empirical reportage necessarily embodies non-empirical, meta- observational assumptions, a straightforward corollary being that empiricism is false. 
And whether or not the present author's views about persistence and occupancy are correct, empiricism is incoherent in the way just mentioned. There is no such thing as a conceptually innocent observation-report. To be sure, some observationreports are more theoretically committed than others. But if purged of their theoretical commitments, our observation-reports would be stilted and useless. One couldn't talk about "radios" or "telescopes," obviously. One couldn't even talk about "space" and "time," since one doesn't observe such things. One observes events that are so interrelated that it is natural to suppose that space and time exist.

we must avail ourselves of ex parte, Hume-ulterior knowledge means that Hume's analysis is wrong (or so revisionist as to be presumed wrong, other things being equal). 
Further proof of the erroneousness of Hume's analysis, and of the correctness of our positive analysis of explanation, is found in a famous puzzle due to Nelson Goodman. 142 Any given green emerald confirms: 
(EG) All emeralds are green. 
Let something be "grue" if it's either examined before t and it's green or it's examined after t and it's blue. 
In that case, supposing the present to be t, EG has exactly as much support no more, no less than 
(EB) All emeralds examined after t are blue. 
But surely something has gone wrong. the last 20 green emeralds I saw didn't provide a whit of support for EB, but they provided plenty of support for EB. 
5.1 Goodman's puzzle is easily adapted to show that any body of data can provide any

Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
:: Q A 
emeralds (examined before t) don't confirm EB the way they confirm EG. EB itself posits discontinuities - many objectual discontinuities, and some nomic discontinuities. (And it's hard to calculate all of the objectual and nomic discontinuities involved in those explicitly mentioned in EB.) So far as EB is confirmed, otherwise non-existent anomalies come into existence. But a hypothesis is confirmed in so far as otherwise non-existent anomalies are pushed out of existence. EB, if true, is an endless source of anomalies. So anything that confirms EB, and therefore disconfirms its negation, is anomaly-productive. Therefore, EB is such that it cannot be confirmed without being disconfirmed. 
Simon Blackburn ( 984) says that what counts as continuity is “relative to our linguistic practices." This is not true. First of all, 'grue' and 'bleen' are not colors; they are color-related predicates, as any date-stamped photographs show, and a consequence of EB's being correct is the world is replete with otherwise non-existent discontinuities. 
What Goodman's puzzle shows is that explanation isn't about finding regularities and subsuming events under them. What it shows is that certain regularities are broken, explanatorily useless, whereas others are not, and it identifies the broken ones - they are the discontinuity-generators. It therefore tells us which ones are not broken: the ones that destroy more discontinuities than they create. Which means that, even in the case of a non-broken regularity, it's not the regularity per se that is

Q A 
explanatorily important; it is the various hyper-continuities constitutive of that regularity. The regularity is a class of hyper-continuities. It's the hyper-continuities that make the regularity a good one, not the regularity that makes the hyper- continuities good. We are interested in regularities only in so far as they are hyper- continuity-conducive, only in so far as, unlike EG, they don't fracture reality, like EB, which means we're interested in continuities, ultimately, the regularities being of interest only in so far as they may help us find the continuities. 
5.3 There is change; change in the manner of change; change in the manner of the manner of change; and so on. What we typically refer to as conditions of changelessness are teeming with lower-order changes; they are conditions of (very) high-order changelessness. The apparent exceptions to our analysis of explanation (‘to explain is to eliminate discontinuities') vanish when we take into account the different levels of change(lesness). A hypothetical, continuous series of events, linking a and b, may be non-explanatory; but, if so, that's because, while staving off an n-level change, it permits the occurrence of n+ -level changes. 
Green emeralds (examined before t) provide no support for EB. They provide no support for the hypothesis that there exists some property of emeralds in virtue of which they're blue if examined after t. data supports regularity-generating mechanisms; it doesn't directly support regularities.

To sum up: green emeralds don't support EB; they support EG. Second, although there is evidence that would support EB, it would be very different from that which supports EG. Third, so far as EB were worthy of consideration, supposing it true would have to lead to fewer anomalies than supposing it false. 
6.0 In Chapter 5, Section 4.1, we considered Wittgenstein's feeble attempt to show that a given person doesn't have the right to conclude that the mental concomitants of other people's behaviors resemble those of one's own; one doesn't even have the right to hold that other people's behaviors have such concomitants. Wittgenstein's argument: One cannot make an inference about a plurality of objects on the basis of just one instance of that plurality. In Chapter 1, Section 8.2, we saw that B. F. Skinner put forth a similar argument. 
The points just made reinforce our earlier critique of Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein's argument assumes that probability is a statistical, not an explanatory notion. We'll see that empiricists have no choice but to make this assumption. But that assumption is false. 
You've held over 30,000 first-editions in your own hands. Every single one of them smelled like pipe-tobacco. You knows all of this. Does that knowledge entitle you to believe that first editions always smell like pipe-tobacco, or even that they're prone to?

"axiom of diversity": given two instances of phi that are also instances of psi, the less those instances of phi otherwise resemble one anther, the more they confirm all phi's are psi's. 
This axiom is easily explained and therefore shouldn't be an axiom. To the extent that those phi-instances resemble each other, you have no assurance that it is by virtue of their being phi's that they are psi's. Given two cancer-stricken methamphetamine addicts who eat only fatty foods, you don't know whether to blame their cancer on their recreational or their dietary habits. 
In any case, it is only relative to a jejune, purely statistical conception of probability that Wittgenstein's argument works. At the same time, the empiricist cannot distinguish between statistical and explanatory probability. This is because explanatory probability is a causal notion - Your uncle's pipe smoking causes his books to smell like-pipe tobacco, Fred's drug habit caused him to get cancer and empiricists deny that anything makes anything happen. 
6.1 Empiricists have tried to statisticalize the explanatory probability, their position being:

The "problem of the priors" - how to pick the right reference-classes when interpreting a formal probability-calculus - cannot be solved on statistical grounds; it has to be solved on grounds of causality and, therewith, of continuity. 
7.0 In Section 4.0, we put forth a transcendental argument to the effect that genidentical thought-episodes are ipso facto the relata of bona fide instances causation. We can use this point to rebut Hume's two attempts to show that there is no such thing as the self or, what is the same, that selves are identical with the mental activity they mediate. 
Hume says that (this is a paraphrase): 
(H1) When I introspect, he encounters only various tickles, itches, etc. - various qualia - but nothing corresponding to a self. So, since introspection yields no self, there is, I must conclude, no empirical evidence that there is a self. Since "empirical evidence" is a pleonasm, like "unmarried bachelor," it follows that there is no evidence support the contention that I have a self (or, more accurately, that I have a self unless my self is constituted in its entirety by the various aforementioned tickles, etc.).

Hume then provides a very different, and much more powerful argument - this one being conceptual, not empirical in nature (this is a paraphrase):

Let b be the confluence of mental events occurring right when you began reading the last sentence, and let b* be the corresponding confluence occurring right when you finished (Let S be the just-mentioned sentence.) Obviously you didn't have to be reading S for your psyche to endure during that interval. But it was sufficient for b*'s being identical with b, although it wasn't necessary for it, that the thought-process initiated by b was brought to a close by b*. It isn't because b and b* belonged to the same mind that b initiated a thought-process that b* concluded. It is because b initiated a thought-process that b* concluded that b and b* belong to the same mind. In general, it isn't because two segments of a thought process belong to the same mind that they constitute one, unbroken thought process. It is because they constitute one unbroken thought-process that they belong to the same mind. 
The self endures by virtue of the relations of cohesion that endure among the particulars that it hosts. The self has those cohesion-relations to thank for its 
existence, not vice versa.

[ Q A 
"The bottommost constituents of the mind," it is tempting to think, “must respond only to local, as opposed to systemic, pressures; for those constituents are the system and therefore fall outside its scope. So to the extent that there are any nuclei of mental activity, they must consist of renegade mental structures, and the mind must ultimately be like a swarm of wasps." 
This involves a non-sequitur. It is possible for all of the constituents of a given system to fall within its scope. The United States is a democracy, and everyone composing that democracy is subject to its laws. There isn't a stratum of people who can do what they want. 
There are two ways that a system can be organized: horizontally and vertically. Horizontal organization consists of the separation of activities into different strata. Vertical organization consists in the existence of structures that coordinate those strata. A society governed by an omnipotent dictator would be a better example than a democracy of a horizontal organization: everyone falls under the dictator's dominion, except the dictator himself, and he falls under nobody's dominion. But actual dictatorships are not perfect instances of horizontal organization; for even the dictator himself needs the cooperation of some of the people he governs, and to that extent he falls within the scope of the system he presides over.

In this respect, I cannot compare the soul more properly to any thing than to a republic or commonwealth, in which the several members are united by the reciprocal ties of government and subordination, and give rise to other persons, who propagate the same republic in the incessant changes of its parts. And as the same individual republic may not only change its members, but also its laws and constitutions; in like manner the same person may vary his character and disposition, as well as his impressions and ideas, without losing his identity. Whatever changes he endures, his several parts are still connected by the relation of causation. And in this view our identity with regard to the passions serves to corroborate that with regard to the imagination, by the making our distant perceptions influence each other, and by giving us a present concern for our past or future pains or pleasures.

8.0 Nothing makes anything happen. 
QA 
Let's refer to this four word slogan as "NC" short for "no cause." 
NC is Hume's legacy to the philosophy of science. 
NC entails either that nothing causes anything to happen. But Hume takes it as a given that there are instances of causation; and for the reasons discussed earlier, he concludes that, supposing NC to be true, the only way to validate statements of the form "e1 causes e2 to occur" (i.e. the only way to interpret in such a way that they come out true) is to say: 
(HC147) e1 causes e2 to occur iff e1 precedes and is spatiotemporally adjacent with e2 and the sequence consisting of e1 and e2, in that order, instantiates a regularity. Hume is probably right to say that, given NC, EC is the only interpretation of causal 
statements that validates them. 
If correct, HC has far-reaching consequences as to what it is to explain an event. Let's start with a platitude: To explain is to find causes; to explain an event is to identify its cause. 148 A vase breaks at time t*. Let B be that event. This vase collided with the ground at t, this being right before t. (Let us set aside subtleties relating to the vagueness of the term "right before.") Let C be that event. (Mentally infill the

8.3 This position is unacceptable. The reason we believe EM to support counterfactuals, and thus to qualify as a natural law, is that we have independent knowledge of many an instance of some metal object's being heated and expanding for that reason. So independently of EM (or of any other natural law, by obvious extensions of what we're saying), we know the cause of many a case of some metal object's expanding; wherefore, we know the explanation of each of those events. So a prerequisite for our being able to distinguish natural laws from non-nomic universal generalizations is our having explained at least one event, an obvious consequence being that DN is false.

another. Assume it a truth that:

8.4 To show that x is an instance of a regularity is to show that it is but one member of a whole class of events we can't explain. To explain Bill's ability to speak by saying "everybody Bill's age can talk" is to say: "I have no idea why Bill can talk or why Ethel or Larry or anyone else can do so." Regularities sometimes tell us where to look for causes. (If I know that everyone who has entered house X in the last 10 hours has died, even though each was previously healthy, I certainly know where to look for the causes of the those ten people's deaths.) But regularities are but shadows cast by underlying causal mechanisms.

But advocates of DN deny this, saying that the real explanation is given by (the likes of) the following: 
(1) All pious people go to Church every Sunday. (2) Bill is pious. 
Therefore 
(3) Bill goes to Church every Sunday. 
But it is neither necessary nor helpful to cite some uniformity of which Bill's going to Church is an instance. Not necessary, because if you know that Bill thinks he'll burn in Hell unless he goes to Church, you've got your explanation right there. Not helpful, because even if you know that all and only pious people go to Church, you don't know whether it's Bill's piety that's the cause of his doing so. Maybe it's a concomitant of the actual cause. Maybe pious people are evildoers and rightly feel guilty about that fact; and maybe they go to Church because they know that, thanks to the token acts of expiation they perform there, they can continue their evil ways while being at ease with themselves.

It has been said, by inter alia some very great physicists and philosophers, that reality comprises nothing but events, and that "forces" are but "mathematical fictions” with the help of which we state in an abbreviated, tractable form truths that would otherwise be hard to express in a way that served the interests of science (or of ordinary communication). Such thinkers have also tended to advocate DN. Hempel himself received an advanced degree in physics. 
This is what Freud would say, and it fits the facts. For decades, a high-ranking federal agent by the name of Robert Hanssen sold top-secret information to the Soviets. During this time, he attended Church several times a week, knowing on many such an occasion that, on that very day, he would guarantee the deaths of American agents in the Soviet Union by apprising the Soviets of their identities.

159. Short for "Dilthey's analysis." 
Q A 
Dilthey's justification for thinking otherwise is that psychologists explain by rationalizing, whereas physicists do not. All advocates of DA justify their acceptance of it in this way. 
Psychology does explain by rationalizing. But the right conclusion to draw is that DN is wrong and that, even though physicists do not explain by rationalizing, nonetheless what psychologists are doing is at bottom what physicists are doing. (What they are doing is the same. How they are doing it differs; so does what they are doing it to.) 
Even though the physicist doesn't explain by rationalizing, physical explanations are similar in some respect to psychological explanations. There is some property P that both types of explanation have in common such that it is by virtue of having P that a given statement-series is a viable data-model. 
The commonality is not hard to find. The physicist is looking for causal mechanisms and so is the psychologist. Since the psychologist is dealing with rational actors, causal mechanisms often take the form of rational motivations and explanation therefore often takes the form of rationalization. 
11.0 Accrding to Hempel (1965), psychology seldom produces bona fide explanations: most of the "explanations" it yields, Hempel says, are but outlines of explanation. Relative to his acceptance of DN, Hempel is right to say this. Given some

psychological event e2, it is seldom possible find some event e1 such that the sequence e1-e2 is an instance of exceptionless regularity, setting aside those that are obviously contrived or otherwise defunct (e.g. every case of JMK's dawning a striped shirt on June 12, 2012 was immediately followed, in both space and time, by JMK's playing handball). 
But this is to the discredit of DN, not of the psychological explanations we are wont 
to accept: 
Anomalous fact (A): The Menendez brothers killed their parents. Explanation (E): They knew they were about to be disinherited and they wanted their parents to die before that happened; and because they weren't deeply principled people, they did not have moral reservations about expediting their parents' demise. 
If DN is right, E is no explanation at all. Not everybody who is amoral and wants to avoid being disinherited kills his or her parents. 
DN is incompatible with the datum that E, even if incomplete, has explanatory value. If DN is right, E's having explanatory value is contingent on there being some exceptionless generalization of which the relevant sequence of events is an instance. So, according to DN, if P1...P1 are the properties that E ascribes to the Menendez brother, there are properties P1...P such that anyone having P1...Pn+m also kills his parents. By the same token, if DN is right, E has no explanatory value unless P1...P is a segment of P1...P

Q A 
11.1 In an effort to deal with the fact that few explanations satisfy the desiderata embodied in DN, Wesley Salmon (1984) proposed the following watered-down version of DN: 
(DN*) To explain an event O is to identify one or more natural laws L1...L such that, given those laws and given a sufficiently precise description of O's immediate antecedents, it logically follows that it is more likely than not that O occurred. 161 
But DN* is no better than DN. First of all, it obviously fails for the same reasons as DN to give a feasible account of psychological explanation. Second, there are many truths P and Q such that, 
(i) Given P, it's less than 50% likely that Q is true; and such that 
(ii) P is the explanation of Q.
