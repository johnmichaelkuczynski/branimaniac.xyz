KUCZYNSKI (ZHI) POSITION STATEMENT
Ninety Paradoxes of Philosophy and Psychology

---

## Social & Institutional Paradoxes

1. Losers hyper-value hierarchies that oppress them in order to prevent others from escaping
2. Useless employees are the most zealous enforcers of organizational rules
3. Independent writers face an unbreakable vicious circle requiring pre-existing popularity to gain popularity
4. Communications technology connects us logically while disconnecting us emotionally
5. US educational funding creates bloated bureaucracies rather than improving education
6. Public education spending is soft communism—government jobs displacing private sector productivity
7. Law enforcement jobs are largely fake jobs created to buy votes
10. Primerica functions primarily as a welfare-qualification scheme for fake employment documentation
12. The people who should be most grateful lack the integrity to give credit where due
13. Medium-funny comedians succeed more than genuinely funny ones
14. Self-identified liberals have higher environmental footprints than self-identified conservatives
15. Conservatives tend toward eco-friendly do-it-yourselfism; liberals toward group-dependency
16. Progress for humanity often renders specific individuals obsolete
17. Conformity to countercultures (goths, hippies) is still conformity
18. Fake rebellion increases where legitimate rebellion is dangerous
19. Old-guard hippies are the establishment; those they oppose are the actual rebels
20. Lawyers create the litigious environment that makes lawyers necessary
21. Suicide harms only those who care about the victim
22. In democracies, people oppress themselves
56. People at the bottom of hierarchies enforce those hierarchies against peers trying to rise
57. Grassroots movements require leaders, but leaders need pre-existing power to gain followers—making true grassroots movements impossible

## Economic Paradoxes

23. Computers eliminating work paradoxically increases work done
24. Economic efficiency increases unemployment (excluding artificial government jobs)
37. Stringent therapist licensing reduces therapist effectiveness
38. Psychiatric treatment often causes more harm than it cures
39. More money spent on economic research yields more useless results
40. Lawyers are better at defending the guilty than the innocent
41. Unions prevent job creation, then claim credit for protecting the jobs that remain
42. People with modest responsibilities deliberately underperform to inflate their importance
43. Professors withhold information to artificially inflate its perceived value
50. Anti-trust laws hurt consumers when applied to firms with large market share due to superior competition
51. Anti-trust laws help consumers when applied to firms that restrict competition
52. Tenure eliminates economic incentives to do good work or hire threatening talent
53. Vindictive leaders are less likely to be overthrown than benevolent ones
58. Incompetence has survival value because hyper-competence provokes resentment
59. Incompetent people get over-promoted (seen as controllable); hyper-competent people get under-promoted (seen as threatening)
60. School psychologists must blame children rather than institutions to keep their jobs
61. Useless laws give states incentive to criminalize populations
62. Defense lawyers' livelihoods depend on laws remaining punitive
63. Superabundant scholarship creates vested interests in suppressing genuine insights
67. Problem-solving institutions have incentives to perpetuate problems when solving them would eliminate the institution
68. Hospitals solve problems because new patients always exist; philosophy departments suppress solutions because their practitioners cannot handle replacement problems
69. Race-studies departments exacerbate racial tensions
80. Slackers work harder than non-slackers because defensive positioning forces them to accept unfavorable terms
81. Extremely successful people work mainly at choosing what work to do, not at doing work proper
82. Economic efficiency makes individuals economically useless and welfare-dependent

## Psychological Paradoxes

8. Rationality is reflective and can break decision deadlocks that intelligence cannot
9. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms wither when fought rather than indulged
11. Optimism is a form of denial rooted in insecurity; self-belief is confidence-driven realism
47. High self-awareness correlates with both well-being and neurotic distress because self-criticism enables adaptation but causes suffering
48. Trying not to think of something initiates a cognitive process without letting it run its course
49. Schizophrenics respond better to treatment in developing countries because restoring self-esteem is easier where expectations are lower

## Logical & Semantic Paradoxes

25. Recursive definitions cannot be recursively defined
26. Formal truth cannot be formally characterized
27. Automation cannot itself be automated
28. "Heterological" when applied to itself contains an undefined pronoun/free variable and is neither true nor false
29. The Liar Paradox: propositions, not words, bear truth values; "I am lying" is simply false when stated perspicuously
30. Berry's Paradox dissolves by distinguishing canonical from non-canonical naming
31. Wittgenstein's rule-following paradox collapses into the trivial point that erroneous hypotheses may fit restricted datasets
32. Quine's indeterminacy of translation thesis is false and presupposes broken behaviorist psychology
33. Sorites paradoxes are solved by replacing binary predicates with comparatives plus contextually-supplied benchmarks
54. Conceptual analyses can be informative because information-load depends on how something is said, not just what is said
55. Fitch's Paradox is not a paradox but a proof that not all truths can be known
70. Authors don't believe everything they write—much is written because it seems warranted, not because it's believed true
71. Bhartrhari's Paradox is a logical blunder: "some things cannot be described" ascribes no property to any particular object
72. "Some things cannot be described" is true (given any language L, non-denumerably many objects cannot be described in L) and false (for any object, some possible language can describe it)
73. The Barber Paradox proves such a barber cannot exist
74. Russell's reasoning about the set of all non-self-containing sets is wrong; "doesn't self-contain" when not elliptical for a non-reflexive statement contains an undefined pronoun
75. The Axiom of Comprehension is correct
76. The Unexpected Hanging Paradox dissolves because "surprise" is relative to time—Smith lacks information until the day of hanging
77. Ross's Paradox: imperatival logic has world-to-word direction of fit, so validity flows from general to specific (opposite of statement logic)
78. The Lottery Paradox: high probability is not certainty; acceptance is pragmatic, belief is alethic

## Metaphysical & Physics Paradoxes

34. A single grain of millet does make a sound—the "no sound" claim is like saying a stereo makes no sound because a deaf person can't hear it
35. To be at rest requires failing to move during a non-null interval; instantaneous position does not constitute rest
36. If irresistible forces exist, unmovable objects cannot, and vice versa (Asimov's solution)
44. Zeno's paradox dissolves because any finite distance can be represented as an infinite series sum
45. Places are constituents, not occupants, of space-time and therefore don't themselves have places
46. The probability of a coin landing in any exact region is infinitesimally small but not zero

## Theology & Omniscience Paradoxes

64. Omniscience is incoherent because knowledge of one kind may exclude knowledge of another kind
65. An omniscient being has a frozen belief-set and therefore cannot decide anything
66. The Heavy Rock Paradox fails because an unliftable rock for an omnipotent being is a logical impossibility like a four-sided triangle

## Epistemology & Induction

79. Beliefs are not justified on strictly statistical grounds but by explanatory superiority
83. The Raven Paradox dissolves because only principled (nomic/causal) generalizations can be confirmed, and these are not equivalent to their contrapositives
84. Enumerative induction is either non-existent or illegitimate
85. Knowledge of the future is based on continuities, not regularities/repetitions
86. Causation is continuation, not constant conjunction
87. Regularities tell us where to look for continuities but never constitute causal knowledge
88. We can know singular causal claims without knowing of any similar cases
89. Goodman's "new riddle of induction" is a non-riddle because induction isn't based on concomitances

## Philosophy of Language & Mind

90. Names are mere labels that "pick up" descriptive information through acquisition context
91. Kripke is right about the semantics of proper names, but semantics isn't known in a vacuum
92. Knowledge starts with beliefs that are not knowledge; beliefs can be justified without the owner knowing the justification
93. Seeking knowledge is knowing a description is instantiated but not knowing the instance; finding knowledge is learning what satisfies that description
94. The ability to learn presupposes constitutive knowledge that isn't acquired
95. Content externalism has absurd consequences (content has no psychological effect; one cannot know what one is thinking about)
96. Thoughts about the external world are had via self-referential thoughts, explaining how different-referent thoughts can be subjectively identical and coincide in content

## Political Philosophy

97. The more legal right a nation has to secede, the less moral right it has (legitimate laws reduce legitimacy of secession)
