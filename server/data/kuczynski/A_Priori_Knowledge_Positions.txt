POSITION STATEMENTS - KUCZYNSKI: A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE AND OTHER PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS

================================================================================

INTENTIONS, VALUES, AND FREEDOM

1. Intentions are judgments as to how to consolidate one's psychological architecture.

2. Values are beliefs as to what, in general, is conducive to the integrity of one's psychological architecture.

3. Freedom is a property of actions and also of desires, contrary to Locke's claim that it applies only to actions.

4. Second-order desires do not collapse into first-order desires; the distinction is meaningful and important.

5. Persons, unlike non-persons, subject their own desires and mental states to critical rational scrutiny.

6. Rational conduct is not identical with intelligent conduct; an act can be highly intelligent yet irrational.

7. An irrational act is one that does not embody due regard for one's various interests, regardless of its intelligence.

8. For an act to be free, one's first-order desires must be consistent with the second-order desires driving that act.

9. Higher-order desires can become mere vehicles for first-order desires through psychological warping.

10. Truly free acts are driven by values, not merely by higher-order desires.

11. Values are not desires, though values may lead to desires and desires may lead to values.

12. Where there are no values, there are no selves, though there may be minds.

13. There is no agency of any kind where there are no selves.

14. Estrangement from one's own actions amounts to estrangement from all of one's own desires.

15. Being free consists primarily in being oneself, and secondarily in being able to do what one wants.

================================================================================

CRITIQUE OF OTHER PHILOSOPHERS

16. Many analyses that philosophers put forth seem not to embody genuine attempts to find the truth; Frankfurt's analysis of freedom does embody such an attempt.

28. First-class philosophical thinkers are more likely to use their intelligence to defend orthodoxies than to look for truth.

29. Students and professors at first-tier philosophy institutions are not more likely to produce better work than their counterparts at bottom-tier universities.

================================================================================

KANT'S ETHICS

17. Kant's two categorical imperatives (universalizability and respect for autonomy) are not equivalent.

18. Acts of con-artistry would not necessarily be self-defeating in a world of con-artists, refuting Kant's CI1.

19. Morally good forms of conduct can be ones that, if engaged in universally, could not be successfully carried out.

20. A moral principle outweighed is not a moral principle extinguished.

21. A categorical moral obligation can be outweighed by some other, stronger obligation without ceasing to exist.

22. Kant's failure to distinguish the good from the praiseworthy is a fundamental blunder in his ethical theory.

23. Many things that are morally good are not commendable; Brown's happiness is good but not praiseworthy.

24. Intelligence, wealth, and health have inherent moral value, contrary to Kant's claim that only good will has moral worth.

================================================================================

CRITIQUE OF WITTGENSTEIN AND ORDINARY LANGUAGE PHILOSOPHY

25. Wittgenstein's central claims about meaning and mind are demonstrably false.

26. Norman Malcolm's denial that people dream was a consequence of following Wittgenstein's false views about mental processes.

27. Ryle's claim that the difference between voluntary and involuntary actions concerns cultural acceptability rather than mental states is obviously false.

30. Strawson's ascriptivist analysis of moral responsibility is false because it makes intentions irrelevant to responsibility.

31. Strawson's expressivist claim that "true" is redundant is false; "everything Plato said was true" cannot be stated without "true" or a synonym.

32. "It is true that snow is white" and "snow is white" are not synonymous; the former concerns a proposition while the latter concerns snow directly.

33. Wittgenstein's claim that "I am in pain" is merely expressive behavior like animal howling is demonstrably false.

34. Austin's performative utterance theory is false; utterances like "I promise" do affirm propositions.

35. Embedding a sentence P in "if P, then Q" does not change P's meaning; this is necessary for indirect arguments to work.

================================================================================

A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE AND ANALYTICITY

36. A priori knowledge is knowledge that does not depend on sensory observation for its justification.

37. All mathematical truths are analytic truths.

38. Not all analytic truths are mathematical truths; statements about mathematics are analytic but not themselves mathematical.

39. No analytic truths are tautologies, since tautologies are definitional truths that hold in virtue of contingent facts about word usage.

40. The statement "a bachelor is an unmarried man" is an empirical truth about language, not an analytic truth.

41. It is incoherent to deny analytic truths, but one can coherently (though incorrectly) deny definitional truths.

================================================================================

GÖDEL AND INCOMPLETENESS

42. Gödel proved that the truths of arithmetic are analytically true but not formally true.

43. What Gödel proved is that there is no recursive definition of the class of truths of arithmetic, not that mathematical truths are non-analytic.

44. Incompleteness is the property of a statement-set having no recursive definition.

45. Most scientifically important statement-sets are incomplete; statement-sets with real scope or explanatory power cannot be axiomatized.

46. There is no recursive definition of the class of statements of the form "x is a real number."

47. A logic (system of logic) is a recursively defined statement-set.

48. The class of all recursively defined statement-sets is not itself recursively definable.

49. There is no recursive characterization of the concept of logical truth.

50. The incompleteness of logic is more general, and perhaps more significant, than the incompleteness of arithmetic.
