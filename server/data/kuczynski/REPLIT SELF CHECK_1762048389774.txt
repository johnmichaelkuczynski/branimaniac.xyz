Before you respond that any task is complete, you must perform all of the following checks:

1. ACTION VERIFICATION
Did you actually perform the action exactly as requested?

Did you check the file, feature, or component to confirm it was updated?

2. OUTPUT CONFIRMATION
Is the result visible and verifiably present in the app?

Can a human visually see that it changed?

3. FUNCTIONAL TEST
If the change affects UI or functionality, did you test that it now works as intended?

Was the bug or failure resolved?

4. NO SIDE EFFECTS
Did you confirm that nothing else broke as a result of the change?

App still builds, runs, and retains all prior functionality?

5. USER CONFIRMABILITY
Is the change stored in a visible, editable file (if relevant)?

Can I inspect and confirm it without having to trust your summary?

IF YOU CANNOT CONFIRM ALL 5:
Do not say the task is complete.

Stop and explain which check failed.

Wait for further instruction.
