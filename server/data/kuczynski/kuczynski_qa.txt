
Does 
the 
payment 
of 
bonuses 
really 
improve 
productivity? 
Yes, 
enormously, 
without 
any 
doubt. 
At 
first, 
people 
are 
happy 
to 
get 
that 
upfront 
pay. 
But 
once 
they 
get 
used 
to 
it 
and 
no 
longer 
feel 
the 
stick 
of 
urgency, 
they 
need 
the 
carrot 
of 
bonuses 
keep 
on 
plugging 
away, 
especially 
if 
the 
work 
involves 
creativity 
or 
insight. 
If 
you 
are 
dealing 
with 
low 
level 
workers—boozers 
who 
are 
putting 
rocks 
in 
a 
bag—then 
not 
so 
much, 
since 
they 
are 
more 
interested 
in 
how 
little 
they 
can 
do 
and 
get 
by 
than 
they 
are 
in 
moving 
forward. 
But 
with 
talent—gotta 
reward 
it. 
How 
do 
you 
prove 
that 
any 
consistent 
set 
of 
sentences 
can 
be 
extended 
to 
a 
maximal 
consistent 
set? 
Let 
S 
be 
a 
consistent 
statement 
set, 
and 
let 
s1 
be 
an 
arbitrary 
statement 
not 
in 
S. 
If 
s1 
is 
consistent 
with 
S, 
then 
the 
union 
of 
S 
and 
s1 
is 
consistent; 
otherwise, 
the 
union 
of 
S 
and 
not 
s1 
is 
consistent. 
Let 
S* 
be 
the 
union 
of 
the 
union 
of 
S 
with 
either 
si 
or 
not-si, 
depending 
on 
whether 
si 
is 
consistent 
with 
S. 
S* 
is 
consistent 
and 
maximal. 
What 
are 
the 
warning 
signs 
that 
a 
client 
is 
going 
to 
be 
more 
trouble 
than 
they're 
worth? 
They 
don’t 
give 
credit 
where 
credit 
is 
due, 
and 
they 
look 
for 
ways 
to 
get 
out 
of 
paying 
you 
what 
your 
owed, 
including 
threatening, 
undermining, 
and 
lying 
about 
the 
quantity 
and 
quality 
of 
what 
you 
have 
done. 
The 
line 
good 
between 
clients 
and 
dirty 
clients 
is 
utterly 
sharp. 
There 
are 
good 
clients 
who 
are 
annoying 
and 
may 
even 
be 
bad 
people 
in 
some 
contexts, 
but 
they 
pay 
and 
they 
are 
honest 
about 
what 
you 
have 
done 
for 
them. 
The 
dirty 
clients 
lie 
about 
what 
you 
done—-and 
they 
show 
their 
true 
colors 
pretty 
much 
right 
away 
(after 
one 
or 
two 
meetings, 
sometimes 
one 
or 
two 
minutes). 
What 
is 
the

Is 
it 
a 
good 
idea 
to 
start 
a

If you have a legitimate business idea, then you have more answers than just about anyone you come across, and you should go for it. 
Yes, be cautious. But be cautious about how you execute your business plan, not about whether to do so. 
Also, there is no way for some other person to know whether your business will take off. Considered on paper, is Facebook a good idea? Probably not, but it worked, and that’s the end of it. 
Also, if you ask other people if your idea is good, they are likely to say ‘no’ if it is good and ‘yes’ if it is bad, because they are stuck at miserable jobs and want you to be stuck with them. 
Finally, if you have an idea, run it by me. No charge. I would be interested. Cheers, Dr. K

What 
profession 
doesn't

the 
bad 
reputation? 
‘procuring’, 
meaning 
being 
a 
‘pimp’ 
or 
‘madam.’ 
those 
professions, 
when 
conducted 
properly, 
minimize 
the 
spread 
of

and 
provide 
healthy

Is 
it 
ever

Absolutely.

No 
qualifications. 
How 
do 
I 
motivate 
myself 
to 
study 
mathematical 
logic? 
I 
am 
very 
interested 
in 
most 
of 
mathematics 
but 
somehow 
logic 
leaves 
me 
indifferent. 
Mathematical 
logic 
is 
a 
bit 
sterile, 
and 
that’s 
probably 
what 
you’re 
picking 
up 
on. 
Plus, 
the 
people 
who 
teach 
it 
are 
kind 
of 
in 
the 
weeds, 
in 
terms 
of 
ability-level 
and 
vision. 
But 
if 
you 
have 
specific 
questions, 
I 
can 
answer 
them 
(no 
charge) 
in 
a 
way 
that 
will 
awaken 
your 
interested 
in 
the 
discipline. 
In 
a 
given 
area 
of 
science, 
several 
different 
explanations 
may 
account 
for 
the 
available 
facts 
equally 
well, 
with 
each 
suggesting 
an 
alternate 
route 
for 
further 
research. 
How 
do 
researchers 
pick 
among 
them? 
Identify 
a 
single 
case 
of 
a 
given 
anomaly 
being 
definitively 
resolved 
by 
two 
incompatible 
hypotheses. 
No 
such 
case 
exists. 
Has 
anything 
that 
had 
once 
been 
proven 
true 
in 
mathematics 
actually 
been 
shown 
to 
be 
false 
later, 
not 
due 
to 
a 
computing 
error, 
but 
rather 
a 
fundamental 
change 
in 
our 
understanding 
of 
logic? 
Short answer—-no: since nothing proven is false. 
Long answer—-there have turned out to be models of axioms that seem self-evidently false. And in some cases, those models are not just theoretical curiosities but are of deep practical significance. 
Example: There are models in which the parallel axiom (parallels don’t intersect) is false, and one of those models describes actual space. 
Example: There are models in which there are infinitesimals (non-null quantities less than any given quantity), and those models are needed to explain actual occurrences (e.g. how it is that a coin can occupy a given place after landing, even though the chances of its doing so are one divided by the number of real numbers, this being smaller than any finite quantity). 
Also, there are counterintuitive results, e.g. that a set can have the same number of elements as a proper subset of itself or, to take a similar example, that the points one a line can be mapped onto those of a region, which in turn can be mapped onto those of a plenum, the latter not just being a curiosity, but being necessary to explain the existence of motion. 
What 
is 
the

of

{x: x . N and, for some y, x=2y)} 
What 
are 
some 
of 
the 
most 
irrelevant 
things 
you 
learnt 
in 
school? 

I studied linguistics for a while—phonology, syntax, and other aspects of modern ‘scientific’ linguistics. That was the most horrid waste of time imaginable. 
Which 
is 
the 
relationship 
between 
social 
psychology 
and 
economics 
in 
studying 
mass 
behaviour? 
Macroeconomics 
is 
social 
psychology, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
latter 
relates 
to 
commercial 
behavior. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
the 
discipline 
referred 
to 
as 
‘social 
psychology’ 
doesn’t 
talk 
much 
about 
economic 
exchanges, 
but 
that 
is 
irrelevant. 
Economics 
is 
good 
at 
providing 
operational 
definitions 
of 
for 
a 
number 
of 
psychological 
and 
epistemological 
concepts 
and 
at 
putting 
contentions 
involving 
those 
concepts 
to 
well-defined 
empirical 
tests. 
How 
important 
is 
randomness 
in 
life? 
Is 
it 
more 
important 
than 
effort 
and 
talent? 
Absolutely 
not. 
It 
is 
is 
very 
hard 
to 
keep 
someone 
down 
if 
he 
has 
talent 
and 
character. 
And 
it 
is 
very 
hard 
to 
prop 
someone 
up 
if 
he 
has 
neither. 
What 
are 
the 
most 
convincing 
arguments 
for 
and 
against 
standardized 
testing? 
Standardized 
tests 
are 
extraordinarily 
efficient 
and 
are 
indicated 
in 
contexts 
where 
only 
very 
approximate 
knowledge 
is 
necessary 
or 
where 
knowledge 
about 
whole 
populations 
(e.g. 
people 
who 
may 
have 
been 
exposed 
to 
toxins 
leading 
to 
psychological 
impairments) 
are 
necessary. 
With 
individuals, 
they 
are 
of 
limited 
use, 
since 
people 
can 
dramatically 
over-or 
under-perform, 
depending 
on 
a 
variety 
of 
contextual 
factors. 
But 
as 
a 
way 
of 
testing 
for 
basic 
knowledge 
of 
basic 
cognitive 
fitness, 
they 
are 
much 
less 
subjective 
and 
resource-intensive 
than 
the 
ad 
hoc 
methods 
currently 
used 
in 
most 
educational 
and 
even 
diagnostic 
contexts. 
How 
do 
I 
stop 
thinking 
bad 
words 
about 
Allah? 
It 
happened 
first 
during 
salah, 
now 
it 
comes 
all 
the 
time. 
I'm 
very 
much 
frightened 
and 
my 
therapist 
concluded 
it 
is 
due 
to 
OCD. 
You think bad thoughts about Allah because you want to be free and somebody is using religious tyranny to constrain you. Accept that, and your intrusive thoughts about Allah will vanish. 
Why 
are 
many 
people 
who 
do 
not 
understand 
mathematics 
still 
fascinated 
by 
the 
subject? 

I think that all people do understand it. What we refer to as ‘mathematical talent’ is about being able to operationalize mathematical intelligence outside of those contexts in which it is automatically operational. And the fascination that all people have for mathematics is the fascination that all people have for externalizations of hidden aspects of themselves themselves. 
Does 
school 
give 
us 
the 
tools 
we 
need 
in 
our 
adulthood? 

No it doesn’t. It doesn’t give us the requisite technical skills. Nor does it give us the requisite understanding of the economy or of its psychological underpinnings. Nor does it encourage the development of the character traits needed to not be a victim once released into the world. 
Can 
I 
get 
arrested 
for 
just 
viewing 
some 
certain 
websites? 

you have to make a purchase or otherwise engage the website in a transactional manner. otherwise no. 
theoretically, if you are involved in a serious crime, they could use your weblogs as evidence against you. but that is another matter and is also very unlikely. 
in 
any 
case, 
when 
browsing 
questionable 
sites, 
use 
a 
vpn. 
don’t 
let 
blowhards 
intimidate 
you 
into 
avoiding 
websites 
that 
you 
want 
to 
visit. 
the 
legal 
system 
responds 
to 
extremely 
specific 
triggers, 
and 
simply 
clicking 
on 
a 
website 
will 
not 
do 
the 
trick. 
you 
should 
actually 
see 
it 
as 
your 
moral 
obligation 
to 
visit 
as 
many 
‘morally 
questionable’ 
websites 
as 
possible 
, 
since 
not 
doing 
so 
means 
conceding 
moral 
legitimacy 
to 
blockhead 
bureaucrats 
and 
moralizing 
phonies. 
just 
make 
sure 
you 
cloak 
your 
identity. 
it 
is 
not 
immoral 
to 
visit 
a 
website. 
it 
is 
immoral 
to 
blow 
moralistic 
hot 
air 
about 
visiting 
a 
website. 
Is 
it 
essential 
to 
study 
the 
same 
subject 
in 
my 
PhD 
thesis 
with 
my 
master's 
thesis? 
absolutely 
not. 
my 
master’s 
thesis 
was 
on 
definite 
descriptions, 
and 
my 
doctoral 
thesis 
was 
on 
legal 
positivism. 
obviously 
there 
is 
a 
tendency 
for 
doctoral 
theses 
to 
be 
continuations 
of 
master’s 
theses, 
but 
usually 
has 
to 
do 
with 
the 
limitations 
of 
the 
individuals 
and 
institutions 
involved, 
granting 
that 
said 
parties 
will 
try 
to 
rationalize 
it 
with 
the 
usual 
puffery 
about 
the 
demands 
of 
scholarship. 
What 
is 
something 
morally 
wrong, 
but 
not 
against 
the 
law? 
Being 
able 
to 
destroy 
somebody 
financially 
simply 
because 
you 
were 
married 
to 
them. 
I 
was 
reading 
an 
article 
about 
how 
people 
with 
OCD 
sometimes 
have 
thoughts 
about 
doing 
something 
violent 
toward 
a 
loved 
one. 
I 
never 
thought 
of 
this 
before 
but 
now 
I 
can’t 
stop 
thinking 
of 
hurting 
my 
cat. 
How 
can 
I 
stop? 
You want to ‘hurt your cat’—-your mind’s way of telling you that you need to ‘pound some p*ssy.’ Not hard to decrypt. I suspect that your cat-torture obtrusive thoughts will go away soon after you read this. 
Why 
is 
it 
so 
hard 
for 
men 
and 
women 
to 
be 
friends? 

Because men don’t want friendship from women, and women don’t want friendship from men. Men want sex and love (in that order) from women, and women want love and sex (in that order) from men. 
Can 
OCD 
develop 
later 
in 
life? 

It can certainly recrudesce at any juncture in life. But it is not likely to come into existence after adolescence. What is more likely is the development of rigidities that mimic OCD but are not OCD. 
What 
is 
the 
educational 
intent 
and 
purpose 
of 
a 
doctoral 
dissertation? 

The purpose of a dissertation is to show that the dissertation-writer can engage existing work in an authoritative and at least relatively original way. 
Granting that not all passing dissertations live up to this description, there is, in my judgement, an important line that separates those who have completed dissertations from those who haven’t. (And there is an even more important line that separates those who can complete with ease from those who take nine years to do so.) 
If 
identity 
is 
fluid 
then 
do 
we 
really 
have 
a 
true 
self? 

What is fluid is how your live out your true self, not what your true self is. People can change a great deal, for better or worse, but some aspects of a person’s psyche cannot be contravened without damaging that person. 
A lot of people rationalize selling out by telling themselves that they are being flexible and ‘fluid’, but they are actually being weak and rigid, since a genuinely adaptive person finds a way to survive without gutting his personality in the process. 
What 
will 
be 
the 
first 
major 
job 
to 
be 
replaced 
by 
robots? 

The first job—-happened a long time ago. The next big one—teachers. Most of that is best automated. 
Why 
have 
philosophers 
abandoned 
logical 
atomism? 

Two reasons. (1) Physical simplicity doesn’t equate to conceptual simplicity. 
(2) Whether a given statement is to be regarded as complex, and how exactly it is to be regarded as complex, depends on the dialectical context. 
Explanation of (1): Suppose for argument’s sake that there are minimal units of physical composition, these being maximally simple building blocks of nature. Given only that these entities are physically simple (or at least relatively so), it doesn’t follow that the truths that describe them, and in terms of which we are to understand them, are correspondingly simple. If anything, the opposite holds: because these entities are known in a such a theory-mediated way, those truths are exceptionally complex. So even if there are ‘atoms’ (minimal building blocks) of nature, they are not building blocks in a logical sense—on the contrary, they are, in that respect, at the opposite extreme of the epistemological pyramid. 
Explanation of (2): Consider the statement “1+1=2.” That statement could function as an axiom (an accepted truth that neither requires nor admits of justification) or (as is the case in set theory), it could function as the end-result of a long chain of reasoning. Any given truth is entailed by infinitely many others and itself entails infinitely many truths. And since a statement’s entailment-relations (what it entails and what it entails it) reflect its structure, there are no ‘ultimate’, foundational truths. Consequently, there are, in this sense, no ‘atoms’ of nature—-no non-composite truths out of which other truths can be constructed or from which they can be derived. 
Summary: Atoms, in the sense in which the philosophy of logical atomism requires them to exist, don’t. 
Do 
men 
ever 
actually 
mature 
emotionally? 

If by ‘mature’, you mean forfeit their own welfare for the petty whims of their ‘significant’ other, then, sadly, the answer is sometimes ‘yes.’ 
If by ‘mature’, you mean ‘learn how their own welfare is tied to that of other people, including, in some cases, that of their significant other’, then, not so sadly, the answer, once again, is ‘yes.’ 
If, by ‘mature’, you have either of the above two meanings in mind, then, even less sadly, the answer is sometimes ‘no.’ 
How 
do 
I 
find 
out 
someone's 
weaknesses? 

Know what they are and what they want to be. If they fall short, that is their weakness. If they don’t, they have no weaknesses. 
If 
women 
could 
design 
a 
perfect 
woman 
for 
men, 
what 
would 
she 
be 
like? 

Like an actual woman during the first 18 months of the relationship. 
If 
A 
belongs 
to 
set 
A 
and 
set 
B, 
does 
it 
imply 
that 
A 
is 
a 
subset 
of 
B? 

No, at least not in general. 
You are a member of the set of people, but you are not a set or therefore a subset. Obviously one can construct a set to which both x and {x} belong, e.g. the set 
that contains {1, 2, 3, and { 2, 3}, this being the four-membered set {1, 2, 3, {2, 3}}. But short answer—no. members not subsets. 
Is 
a 
Master's 
degree 
in 
Economics 
a 
waste 
of 
time? 

The formal study of economics at any level is the very definition of a waste of time. There have been some brilliant minds in the field of economics,, and being conversant with some of the key ideas is deeply important in many contexts, both practical and theoretical. But when you study economics in a classroom, all you are doing is doing monkey math that relates to monkey models that have zero predictive or explanatory power and will just rewire your brain in a way that makes it useless to everybody, especially employers. Nobody pays anybody to be an economist. They pay them to be accountants or brick-layers—-but to ‘economize’? Ha! If you ask a pan-handler and an economist what will happen to the local (or national or international) economy in one week/month/year/decade, the pan-handler is more likely to be right. The reason is that knowing where the economy is moving is about knowing specifics and it is most definitely not about knowing of some economic ‘model.’ After all all is said and done, some economist can stand on the rubble and pontificate with some model, but basically he’s delivering a eulogy. If you want predictions, ask the guy landscapes your garden or fixes your car. Don’t ask an economist, at least not an economics professor. 
If you want to get a master’s degree that sharpens or broadens your mind, study Medieval folklore or machine learning or Scandinavian poetry. If you want to turn your mind into innumerate taffy that is stuffed with idiocies relating to game-theory and other attempts to breath fake mathematical life into one third true models of human conduct—then have at it! 
Let me put these vituperations into a little context. I got my PhD in philosophy, got a professorship, wrote a million books (two while still in grad school), then noticed that the discipline was stagnant. So I looked for new intellectual hunting ground, and chose economics. 
I did this because I noticed that the behavior of people in institutional contexts was ultimately to be understood in economic terms (in terms of their needing a paycheck) and that their psychopathologies affected only the particular manner in which they acted out these economic forces. So I then read some economics—Smith, Marshall, a bit of Keynes, Jevons, Friedman. And it was enormously illuminating, especially Smith and Marshall. 
Fast-forward ten years. I run a tutoring business for people in college and graduate school, around 50% need help with finance and economics. So I had to grind through millions of problem sets about demand curves and Cournot equilibrium and Keynsian range of the aggregate supply curve, etc. In fact, I’m doing this right now. (Client on bathroom break and therefore away from Skype.) 
The take-home: not illuminating. These people—these econ undergrads and grad students—-spend their time staring into the abyss of hybrid logic puzzles that have nothing to do with economic reality but are also too impure to even be good intellectual exercises. Works for me, though, since I pay people to babysit these tragedy-cases and keep a cut. But in terms of doing it —well, been there, wouldn’t recommend it for anyone. 
Last point: If you read the really old economists, Hume, Smith, Marshall—­they’re pretty darn good. But they are also very specific, as in, they aren’t really putting forth models, except occasionally and with heavy reservations. But at some point, something horrible happened to the discipline; they tried to model it on physics or some such, and it lost all contact with anything real. So now all you get are get screw-up ideas seem to have written by malfunctioning cyborg. But anyway—-an economist degree doesn’t impress anybody. Not anymore. Maybe in 1980, but not now. 
The 
limit 
of 
(1/n), 
as 
n 
goes 
to 
infinity 
is 
zero, 
but 
(1/n) 
is 
not 
equal 
to 
zero 
when 
n 
goes 
to 
infinity, 
where 
is 
the 
fallacy 
or 
the 
philosophy? 

cardinal zero vs. real zero. the real number zero is a limit, this being why an even with probability zero can occur, e.g. a coin can land on a region r such that r is one of infinitely many regions where the coin could possibly land. but the cardinal number zero is not a limit; it is the size of a set. so the fallacy is equating reals with cardinals.

What 
is 
the 
difference 
between 
psychosis 
and 
dissociation? 

Psychosis involves a garbling or scrambling of one’s mental representations of external reality. The psychotic jumbles together distinct elements (e.g. she sees a connection between her recent break-up and the thunder-storm that is now occurring) and gives undue weight to connections that actually do exist 
(e.g. she is right to believe that her mother is angry with her but wrongly infers that her mother is going to kill her). Dissociation does not necessarily involve such distortions; it involves a suppression of the emotional accompaniments of one’s representations of the world, resulting in a stated of ‘disconnectedness’ or ‘dissociation’, but does not necessarily involve a warping of those representations themselves. In fact, dissociation diminishes the likelihood of such distortions, since it disarms those representations by robbing them of emotional force and therefore makes it unnecessary to disarm them by altering them. 
What 
is 
the 
most 
dangerous 
idea 
in 
contemporary 
philosophy, 
and 
why? 

The most dangerous question in philosophy is whether there can be political solutions to biologically or culturally rooted problems. People on the right are aware of these problems and try to side-step them with winks and nods about ‘law and order’ (which they implement and which backfires horribly) and ‘small government’ (which they do not implement, despite their obviously false assertions to the contrary). People on the left hold that extensions of government will solve the problem, which they sometimes do but sometimes don’t. 
What is striking, however, is that there is practically no system of government that has not worked at certain junctures and that also hasn’t failed at others, calling into question the whole legitimacy of the discipline of political philosophy and, indeed, of the very concept of the ‘proposition’ state. 
There is only so far political systems can go in the way of contravening biological facts (e.g. differences between genders) without imperiling their own viability, and the most dangerous question of contemporary philosophy is what those limits are. Academic philosophers are not likely to be aware of the significance of that question, and they have proven totally incapable of answering even their own artificial questions. But a lot of good work, by people of all ideological stripes and backgrounds, has been done on it.

Paradox? 

In order to travel a distance of n yards, it is necessary to travel a distance of n/10 yards. In order to travel a distance of n/10 yards, it is necessary to travel a distance of n/100 yards. In general, 
(i) one cannot travel any distance at all without already having traveled some smaller distance. 
Consequently, 
(ii) Any given motion presupposes a prior motion. 
A consequence of (ii) is: 
(iii) There is no such thing as a stationary object’s beginning to move, 
Another consequence of (i) is: 
(iv) There is no such thing as an object’s ceasing to be in a given place. 
A consequence of (iv) is 
(v) 
Nothing moves. 

(i) 
is true. (v) follows from (i). But (v) is false. 


How to solve this paradox? 
Eugene Mills’ solution to Zeno’s paradox 
For any possible universe U, there is some distance D such that nothing in U can move at all without covering a distance of at least D. 
Explanation: Zeno has established that if any given motion presupposes another motion, then nothing can even begin to leave the place that it is occupying at a given time. Therefore, (i) must be rejected. 
Assuming that (i) is false, it is not possible for there to no minimum, short of nullity, to the amount by which a given object moves. Therefore, in any world where motion is possible, there is some finite distance such that anything that moves in that world moves by at least that distance. 
Problems with Mills’ solution 
If Mills is right, then any given universe U consists of discrete cells such that, for any occupant x of U, x moves by vanishing from one cell and then appearing in another. x cannot move from one cell to the next, since there would in that case not be a minimum distance that x had to travel in order to travel at all. 
A consequence of Mills’ position is that nothing moves. The assertion that 
(i) x spontaneously appears in one cell and spontaneously reappears in an adjacent cell 
is equivalent with the assertion that 
(ii) x spontaneously ceases to exist and an x-like object that is not identical with x spontaneously appears in a cell adjacent to that occupied by x. 
If you are obliterated and some person who is exactly like you appears a moment later right next to where you were standing, that person isn’t you. Let you2 be that person. Given that you2 came into existence spontaneously, there are no lines of transmission linking him to the past and thus no lines of transmission linking you2 to you. Therefore, you2 is not you; and youn (n>2) isn’t identical with either you or with youi (1=i<n). 
If n is a sufficiently high number and there is a sufficiently small delay between youi’s disappearance and youi+1’s appearance, it will certainly appear that you had moved from one place to another. But that is obviously irrelevant. 
In a Mills-universe, nothing has a past and, therefore, nothing has a future. Everything that exists, exists for an instant and then vanishes. There is no possibility of mutual causal influence among the occupants of a Mills-universe. 
Such a universe is no universe at all, since any given occupant of such a universe is in the very condition that it would be in if it were in a universe all by itself. Therefore, a Mills-universe is a non-universe. 
Also, relative spatial and temporal position are to be understood in causal terms. Events are simultaneous if neither can affect the other; otherwise non-simultaneous. Since there is no causation in a given Mill-universe U, no U-occupant x can have either a spatial or a temporal position relative to any other U-occupant y. Thus, a Mills-universe is one in which there are neither places nor times. 
In conclusion, Mills has given us a heap of absurdities, not a solution. 
Bertrand Russell’s solution to Zeno’s paradox 
The sum of infinitely many positive numbers may be finite (e.g. 1+½+¼+… =2), and any finite number can be represented as such a sum. Therefore, the sum of infinitely many non-null motions may be a finite motion, and any given finite motion can be represented as such a sum. It is therefore no more of a mystery that any given motion should follow an infinite series of motions than it is that 2 should equal 1+½+¼+… 
Problems with Russell’s solution 
This is not a good solution. Zeno is asking how a given object can take that first step. He is asking how an object that moves 2 inches can move inch, and then another ½ inch, and then another ¼ inch, and so on. Russell hasn’t answered that question. He has only made the irrelevant point that if a given object can move that first inch, then it can, after an infinite series of further motions, move a second inch. 
“The first step is the hardest,” said Mao Tse Tung. Once an object moves that first inch, all of the remaining inches are a foregone conclusion. This is the conceit underlying both Russell’s solution and Mills’. But each of these solutions merely begs the question, given that the very thing Zeno is asking is how that first step can be taken. 
The actual solution to Zeno’s paradox 
All position is relative position. Therefore, changes in position are changes in relative position. If x is the only occupant of a universe U, it cannot be said that x moves or a fortiori that x moves by a given amount. For there is nothing in relation to which x’s position can change. 
Nor can it be said that x exists at a given time or for a certain period of time. For there is nothing that x either follows or precedes or with which it is simultaneous. 
Therefore, the universe occupied by x comprises no spatiotemporal positions, except such as are internal to x’s proper parts. So far as there are relative positions or changes therein, they are strictly x-internal. 
x can equally be thought of as the sole occupant of U or as U itself. In either case, it is x’s proper parts to which relative positions and therefore changes in relative position can be ascribed and it is therefore x’s proper parts to which positions of any kind can be ascribed. 
The sole occupant of a universe is that universe. Contrariwise, a space-time manifold has no existence independently of its occupants. 
Position and change therein are multiply relative. Given only two objects, x1 and x2, it can be said that x1 and x2 are now further from each other, or closer to each other, than they were previously. But it cannot be said that either of them has changed its relative position by this or that specific amount. This is because, just as position is relative position, so distance is relative distance. If, in addition to x1 and x2, there is a third object x3, the distance between x1 and x2 can be compared with the distance between x1 and x3, and it can be said that the one distance either equals or exceeds the other. But unless there is a fourth object x4, it cannot be said by how much the one distance exceeds the other. 
The more objects there are in a given universe, the greater the number of distances with which a given distance can be compared. The more such distances, the higher degree of precision with which a given distance can be meaningfully described. 
Therefore, if x1…xn are the occupants of a given universe, changes in xi‘s position are capable of being small to the extent that n is large. It is the value of n that sets the metric. What we think of as a case of motion on the part of a given object xi is really a change undergone by x1…xn collectively. Seemingly system-internal changes are systemic changes. Therefore, to say that motion is continuous is to make the correct, if trivial, point that the class of changes capable of being undergone by a universe whose sole occupants are x1…xn is, for any number m, a proper subset of the class of changes capable of being undergone by an otherwise identical universe whose occupants are x1…xn…xn+m. 
So when it is said that xi must move ½ inch in order to move an inch, and ¼ inch in order to move a ½ inch, and so on, the point being made is this: 
(1) Given any displacement d, no matter how small, if the universe were better populated and otherwise more heterogeneous than it currently is but all other factors, in including the laws of nature, were held constant, it would be possible for there to be an even more smaller displacement d*. 
Given that xi moved .n inches is really an abbreviated way of describing a change collectively undergone by all of the universe’s occupants. Therefore, the meaning of (1) is given by the truth that: 
(2) No matter how well populated and otherwise heterogeneous the universe is, the universe is capable of being even more populous and otherwise heterogeneous; and for this reason the class of possible states of the universe is a proper subset of the class of possible states of a more heterogeneous but otherwise identical universe. 
Let us consider the following statement in light of (2): 
(a) Any given motion consists of other, smaller motions; there is no minimal unit of distance 
Given (2), it follows that (a) has nothing to do with the structure of motion, its real meaning being given by 
(b) If K is the class of possible states of the universe as it currently is and K* is the class of possible states of an otherwise identical universe that is more heterogeneous than others, K is a proper subset of K*. 
There is nothing paradoxical about (b). It is a truism, in fact. And there is no analogue of Zeno’s paradox that holds in connection with (b). 
Systemic changes are too complex for us to understand with any precision. It is only by conceiving of them as system-internal changes that we can have any understanding of them. We should therefore expect contradictions to arise if we take such approximations as bona fide truths.

Wittgenstein, by contrast, was a radical anti-realist. His position was that mathematical truths are pure conventions—mere ‘games.’ 
Wittgenstein failed utterly in his attempt to establish this, and his views on mathematics are no sooner understood than refuted. 
Godel, by contrast, had cogent reasons, both mathematical and philosophical, for his realism about mathematical entities. His views on the matter are concisely stated in his lecture “Is Mathematics the Syntax of Language?”

in terms of which schools are likely to get you a job teaching logic/philosophy—-just look at the rankings. 
in terms of which schools will actually teach you something of substance about the discipline—none of them. 
logic, as it is taught in philosophy and even in math departments, is a heap of artifacts. supposedly the discipline is meant to discover ways to automate thought, but the algorithms it produces to that end require more thought to use than they succeed in automating. which means they do the exact opposite of what they are supposed to do. 
apart from a few bleak results relating to a few quantifiers, the discipline of formal logic can be counted as one of man’s greatest failures. 
there is logic as it is taught—which is a crock. then there is actual logic, which is too dynamic and fluid for logic professors to get their arms around. 
it’s similar with economics. there is actual economics—which is interesting but fluid. and then there is economics as it is taught in colleges—-which is pretty much a series of p.o.w. camp torture experiments, which yield exactly zero point zero understanding of economic phenomena (or anything else, for that matter).

Yes. Nobody reads them. Ever. Unless they’re looking for a lead-in for their own never-to-be-read (because not worthy of being read) recycle-job. 
Go ahead and read some recent ‘work’ on the mind-body problem, or (God forbid) on ‘ethics’, and you will truly understand the concept of nothingness. 
And nobody reads them because they’re boring, and they’re boring because they’re bad, because academia, with some minor qualifications (that don’t apply to you have if you have to ask) is not where the action is now. 
Those papers are for show only. They look nice—as in the covers and typography and lay-out all look nice. But there’s not very much there. 
Back in the day, when I was in that rat-race, I published some journal articles that actually contained succinct resolutions of technical questions for which other scholars were supposedly looking for answers. I mean—nice little proofs. And on the rare occasions that were any responses, they were either slimy and political or were just as props for some other professor who wanted support for his own ideas. 
Setting aside medical journals and few other journals of that ilk, they literally cannot give away copies of the most ‘prestigious’ journals. They cannot even give away e-copies. They get spam complaints. Mind, Philosophical Review, the Journal of Philosophy—-it turns out that, when readership-levels are independently assessed, their readerships are quite literally non-existent. (Not an overstatement. Do an Amazon search. You’ll see.) And they’re non­existent because those journals are not journals; they’re nice little hunks of processed wood, which have about as much meaning as that mug of yours that says “World’s Best Dad.” 
100 years ago, academic journals served a function. Crelle’s Journal, the Monatshrifte in which Einstein and Godel published their results—yes, these were nice sources of information. But academic journals now are about circling the wagons and bestowing in-house titles on other members of a dying and now totally irrelevant club. 
Just for show. Just a front. No there there. 
But don’t take my word for it. Go ahead and try to read one page of one article in the top journal in religious studies or history or (medicine aside) any other field. 
The obvious response to all this is that academic journals are not for general consumption. This seems reasonable enough—but when I say nobody reads them, I mean nobody. Real thinkers don’t go there for ideas; they flee from the journals, as from wild bees. If anyone thinks otherwise, I invite them to show me peer-reviewed publication list, and I will then show them mine. 
I stopped publishing in the journals, and even stopped publishing with academic publishers, because that is no longer how ideas are disseminated. They are at this point purely token, and they don’t engage anything. The idea that they service small but important niches is an invidious lie. 
These papers are just markers in slimy bureaucracy-internal games; and because people think otherwise, the pathetically slow distribution mechanisms to which they belong get to keep on jamming up thought. 
Finally, there is old saw that these various papers are like atoms jostling against one another—what a given one does tends to be negligible, but, so it is alleged, they collectively constitute a rich discourse out of which great things sometimes come. 
Totally false. Nothing is innovated in the journal-space. Nothing gets published if it has so much as a shred of merit. The journals are about as responsible for intellectual ferment as real estate agents are for building houses. Beware the standard rationalizations.

If you call out poser fake-rebels on their fake acts of rebellion, that will definitely spark debate. or more likely hysterical hissing fear and hate. 
every tom, dick, and harry says that abortion is just dandy—-which, whether or not it is true, is not rebellious, but people will still claim that it is. 
same with the now very, very old anti-religion memes that are bandied about —a way for creatively sterile dopes to bootstrap themselves out of oblivion by going after a soft and officially approved target. 
also, firebrand political slogans that aren’t acted upon—when called out for the puffery that they are—send their purveyors running for the hills. 
being pro-abortion was slightly rebellious 250 years ago, in certain cultures, in certain contexts. not in ours. not in the last 60 years anyway. 
saying taxation is theft—though true—is not rebellious. acting on it is rebellious. 
saying ronald reagan was a bad president—though accurate—is not in and of itself rebellious, unless it is said exactly how he was a bad president. and if it is said that he was bad by virtue of being a too right wing, then you know you’re dealing with faux-rebel, because the man was not right wing (or left wing, for that matter).

Incompleteness implies mechanical but not absolute undecidability. 
For a statement-set to be incomplete is for there to be no recursion that generates it. 
When there is no such recursion, it means that there isn’t a mechanical test for determining whether a given object belongs to that set, but it doesn’t mean that there isn’t some other way of making this determination. 
The class of real numbers is incomplete, since, as Cantor proved, you can always construct a real number that is not in a given recursively defined number-set. But we can recognize real numbers when we come across them —we just don’t do so by applying recursions. In other words, we don’t do so mechanically. 
The class of arithmetical truths is non-recursive, since, as Godel proved, we can always construct an arithmetical truth that does not belong to a given recursively defined class of such truths. We are able to recognize such a truth for what it is—but we don’t do so by applying recursions. In other words, we don’t do so mechanically.

A genuinely good question. The answer is that most of the jobs that still exist are not necessary. They’re just ways of cashing in on wealth-transfer schemes, since the real work is increasingly done by a few entrepreneurs and a lot of robots. (Not much need for bag-boys in a world of self-checkout lanes.) And since teens don’t have the paper credentials needed to cash in on these arrangements, they don’t. 
Employers will justify denying employment to teens on the grounds they ‘fear lawsuits.’ This is a lie. Nobody sues a business for employing teens. And teens are often very good workers, because they have energy and hope. It’s not about lawsuits; it’s about wanting to be eligible for government money and union-money and all that other graft, which goes out the window when independent labor is hired. 
Setting aside a few genius entrepreneurs and a slightly larger number of very hard working borderline genius ones, most jobs are legalized extortion. Lawyers don’t do squat; but if you don’t go through them, the judge will throw the book at you. If you think you’re paying for their legal talents, think again. The paint-huffing wino camped on your front-door steps has a better grasp of legal nuances than your average attorney, as you’ll find out when you have your ‘day in court.’ 
Salesmen, ‘educators’, police officers, ‘intake coordinators’—-people would pay not to use them if given a choice. But they are not given a choice, since they are all rammed in by laws and regulations, all of which teens and other outsiders are on the outside of. 
And since jobs are now mainly about belonging to crypto-welfare clubs, they are therefore heavily insulated by regulations and other initiation-rites, all of which teens are on the wrong side of. 
People like Bill O’Relly gas on and on about the glories of after school jobs and the virtues of ‘self-reliance’—all of which is totally without meaning in today’s economy. Jobs are so regulated now that, without a ton of credentials, one is lucky to get a job that pays enough for the gas and parking fees involved. 
In some ways, the economy is reverting to what it was like two hundred years ago, when it was less about ‘jobs’ and more about trades. Which is good, because jobs are horrid.

Russell’s mathematical philosophy (i.e. his work on the foundations of mathematics, along with some of the philosophical corollaries thereof) is not particularly challenging. Some of the applications of it are extremely illuminating, e.g. the price definitions thereby yielded of ‘point in space’ and ‘point in time’ (due to Whitehead, incidentally). But hard to understand? Not really. 
As far as philosophy is concerned, the really challenging work concerns how to apply it. Philosophy-internal problems are relatively tractable (and, when not tractable, are best not paid to much attention to), but reconfiguring frozen results in epistemology and semantics so as to make them relevant and useful —-that is a challenge indeed! 
As for your question about the relative intelligence-levels of people with degrees in these fields—-not important. If you have a knack for electrical engineering, there is plenty of work for you, none of it easy!

No. 
Knowledge of the past is based on knowledge of the present—-along with knowledge of the past. How does one know what happened in the past? One knows (a) how things are now and one also knows (b) causal 
mechanisms that explain why things now are the way they are. 
For example, one knows (a*) there is smoke, and one also knows (b*) that smoke in the present is a consequence of fire in the recent past. Therefore, one can deduce from the existence of present smoke that there 
recently was fire. In general, knowledge of the past presupposes knowledge of the present. 
Therefore knowledge of the present cannot in its entirety be based on knowledge of the past. Of course, there is another way to interpret your question: You could, at least 
technically, be asking whether present instances of knowledge are always the effects of past instances of knowledge? But the answer to that question is, trivially, ‘no.’ For were the answer ‘yes’, there could be no first instance of knowledge.

There are two classes of such disputes: 
(i) 
Those that are emotional in nature, though they are presented as being about objective moral verities. And 

(ii) 
Those that are rooted in fundamentally different cognitive architectures. 


Examples of (i): 
*Disagreements between the left wing and the right wing (e.g. is affirmative action legitimate?) 
*Disagreements between men and women (e.g. as a husband, is Jim morally obligated to his wife to be both a bread-winner and 100% monogamous?) 
*Disagreements between religions (e.g. what does God believe to be a wife’s obligations to her husband and a husband’s obligations to his wife?) 
*Disagreements between cultural/ethnic groups (e.g. who victimized whom? who owes whom reparations or apologies?) 
*Disagreements between individualists and collectivists (e.g. to what extent can it be morally permissible to violate institutional norms or rules? are the police and ‘the law’ intrinsically valuable or are they simply necessary evils —-or indeed unnecessary evils?) 
Note on the last entry: Strikingly, people who self-identify as ‘liberal’ etc. are hyper-authoritarian and are sticklers for observance of laws and institutional protocols. 
Similarly, self-identified ‘right wingers’ (not Republicans or Sunday libertarians, but actual right wingers), despite their tough talk about who should be taken to the woodshed, often have, or so their conduct suggests, extremely non-authoritarian, almost Kropotkin-like anarchical views about the rightful role of government etc. 
Examples of (ii): 
*Rationalism vs. empiricism: To what extent, if any, can ‘pure thought’ apprise us of the structure of reality? 
*Methodological pluralism vs. methodological monism: Is there a single template into which all legitimate sciences fit? 
*The mind-body problem: Is the mind simply a biological phenomenon like any other, or is there something distinctive about and, therefore, about the way it is to be studied? 
*The unconscious: Is the mind identical with pure consciousness or was Freud right to posit underlying strata of mental activity? 
*Are there laws of economics? Should each economic context be understood on its own terms? Or should we compile a set of economic laws in terms of which we view such phenomena? 
Category (ii) disputes, I believe, are not emotional; they have to do, so I believe, with different ways of processing information, not so much with different desires. Category (i) disputes have to do with different desires and are basically unresolvable.

One must necessarily be a Platonist. There is no way to replace references to numbers, mathematical operations, or other mathematical structures with references to spatiotemporal entities. 
First of all, there no observable instances of infinite quantities. One can see two hands, three apples, and so on, but not infinitely many. 
Second, although one observe instances of operations that are analogous to addition, division, multiplication, and so on, one does not observe any actual such instances. You can put one rock on top of another, but that is not the operation of arithmetical addition. When you say that “1+1=2”, you are saying that union of two non-overlapping unit sets is a dual set; you are not saying anything about any physical operation. Proof is that any physical alteration alters the operands, whereas no arithmetical operation does so. (Rocks are altered when moved; numbers are not altered when added.) 
Similar points hold of garden-variety logical operations, such as negation (‘not’), disjunction (‘or’), and conjunction (‘and’). One can observe analogues of negation—one can witness acts of destruction, for example— but not negation per se, since the latter, unlike the former, takes truths and falsehoods for its operands. One cannot even observe veritable instances of conjunction, since conjunction operates on truths and falsehoods, whereas its physical proxies operate on rocks and eggs and other non-truths and non-falsehoods. 
As for the idea that infinite quantities and arithmetical operations and other distinctively mathematical structures can be ‘abstracted’ from observable phenomena—-that is irrelevant, since it speaks only to our knowledge of those operations, not to their existence and therefore doesn’t eliminate the corresponding need for a Platonic metaphysics. It may well be that awareness of the operation of addition was triggered by people seeing rocks placed on top of rocks; but there is no way to abstract away all the mathematically irrelevant facts about such an operation except in terms of some antecedently recognized, and therefore antecedently existent, standard of relevance, this being the arithmetical operation per se. In general, abstraction is the process not of creating, but of recognizing the existence of the abstract entity in question and therefore presupposes said entity’s existence. 
Further, even outside of mathematics, there is no way to eliminate the need for non-spatiotemporal entities. There is no way to translate the statement “one can have most of the properties of a good general without being a general’ into a statement that doesn’t presuppose the existence of properties per se; nor indeed is there any way to validate even so rudimentary an inference as “John and Tom are both smart; therefore, there is something that they have in common”, since “something” in this context means “some property.” 
The resistance that people have to Platonism is misconceived and derives from their assuming that Platonic entities, if they exist, are giant copies in the sky of their Earthly instances. They assume that the property of being a cat is a cat-in-the-sky, the same mutatis mutandis being true of the property of being a square, and so on. This is not the right way to think of properties. A property is simply a way that things can be. Equivalently, a property is a possibility. If you are jogging, as opposed to watching t.v., that simply means that there two possibilities only one of which was actualized; two paths or ‘ways of being’, only one of which was taken; two properties, only one of which was instantiated.

Right now the most urgent and therefore interesting philosophical problem is how Right now the most urgent and therefore interesting philosophical problem is how information can be encrypted to as to expedite the transmission of it and maximize the absorption of it. 
We are living in the information age. Commerce is now quite as much about the exchange of information as it is about the exchange of physical goods and services. As Robert Kiyosaki points out, whereas power used to be about ownership of land and other physical assets, power is not about ownership of ideas. 
At the same time, as Al Ries points out, the problem is not always that one lacks information; sometimes it is that one has too much of it or doesn’t have it in forms in which it is easily communicated or easily absorbed. 
So right now, the name of the game is to figure out knowledge can so encrypted as to be maximally bioavailable and maximally easy (for both living and artificial systems) to store and transmit. 
All of this being so, be extremely wary of obscure responses to your question, since they ipso facto embody ignorance of this most salient of contemporary philosophical truths.

Absolutely not. In fact, strictly semantic questions categorically fall outside the scope of philosophy, the asseverations of a few early 20th century lightweights to the contrary. 
First of all, semantics is language-specific. Points about English-semantics don’t carry over to Spanish or Arabic or any other language. Meta-semantic points—-points about what semanticists do—do fall within the scope of philosophy. Meta-semantic points include those relating to: 
*The relationship between language and thought is 
*The relationship between logical form and grammatical deep structure 
*The conditions that a learnable language must satisfy 
*The conditions that a language must satisfy to be expressively capable in a certain respect. 
But no such point comes within a country mile of what semantics proper is concerned with. 
Philosophers are concerned with identity, causality, the nature of thought, the relationship between universals and particulars, and the like, none of which is to any degree language-specific and none of which, consequently, is to any degree, in any respect ‘semantic.’

An incompleteness theorem is one to the effect that there is no recursive definition of a given statement-class. 
The first such theorem was that there is no recursive definition of the class of truths of the form ‘x is a real number.’ This was proved by George Cantor in the 1870’s, and the proof involved a technique known as ‘diagonalization.’ 
Fifty years later, Godel tried to come up with a recursive definition of the class of arithmetical truths. He couldn’t and then decided to prove that no such definition was possible. 
He succeeded. His proof involved an exotic form of diagonalization.

Abductive reasoning is simply hypothesis-formation. Your cheese is vanishing. You notice an increasing number of mouse-size bites out of your hunk of cheddar cheese and an increasing number of mouse-size footprints in vicinity of said cheese. You hypothesize, i.e. abductively reason, that a mouse is eating your cheese. This is abductive inference. 
As for its benefits over deduction, they are innumerable. You cannot deduce that a mouse is eating your cheese. If you can know that x is a triangle, you can deduce that x has three sides, since ‘x is a triangle’ is analytically incompatible with ‘x does not have three sides.’ But ‘a mouse is not eating my cheese’ is not analytically compatible with the aforementioned data.

Not possible. Modus ponens is basically to the effect that you can infer it if it follows. Without it, you are in dry dock, inference-wise. Of course, you can always tinker with the way it is expressed. Instead of 
saying ((P->Q) &P)->Q, you can say: -((-P or Q)&Q)&-Q) But given that ‘P->Q’ is definitionally equivalent with ‘-P or Q’, this isn’t 
exactly a way to get rid of modus ponens. Same holds if you try any other work-around.

rules 
are

that 
whether

an 
absurdly 
constricted 
conception 
of 
what 
counts 
as 
a

believing 
that 
the

a

zombies, 
such 
as 
he 
believes 
human 
beings 
to 
be, 
there 
are 
no 
social 
contexts. 
Finally, 
given 
any 
two 
rules, 
the 
behaviors 
involved 
in 
following 
them 
are 
utterly 
distinguishable 
except, 
as

The question is misconceived. 
First, some terminology. A conditional statement is one of the form ‘if p, then q’, e.g. ‘if JM has three cars, then JM has an odd number of cars.’ 
Second, the ‘antecedent’ of a conditional statement is the ‘if’ part, and the ‘consequent’ is the ‘then’ part. So in ‘if JM has three cars, then JM has an odd number of cars’, the antecedent is “JM has three cars’ and the consequent is “JM has an odd number of cars.” 
That particular conditional is true, even though the antecedent is false. It is true that if JM has three cars, then JM has an odd number of cars. It would be true if I had 0 cars, 1 car, 2 cars, 3 cars, etc. All that matters is the relationship between antecedent and consequent. 
The truth-values of antecedent and consequent are irrelevant, with the qualification that, if the conditional is true, then the consequent cannot be false if the antecedent is true. 
Suppose I had zero cars. In that case, both antecedent and consequent would be false, but the conditional would still be true. 
Suppose I had one car. In that case, the antecedent would be false and the consequent would be true, and the statement as a whole would be true. 
Suppose I had two cars. In that case, both antecedent and consequent would be false, but the conditional would still be true. 
Suppose I had three cars. In that case, both antecedent and consequent would be true and the conditional would be true. 
By the same token, even if both antecedent and consequent are true, the conditional may be false. For example, “if Warren Buffet is from Nebraska, then Warren Buffet is a billionaire” is a false conditional with a true antecedent and a true consequent. 
As the term “if” is used in elementary logic classes, any conditional is true so long as it doesn’t have a false consequent and a true antecedent. But that is an artifact of a neologism and is of no philosophical substance. 
Your question seems to be motivated in part by a misunderstanding of this last fact.

Any given body of truths is necessarily internally consistent. Therefore mathematics, setting aside the odd screw-up, is consistent. 
People make the mistake of assuming that ‘consistent’ means ‘capable of being axiomatized.’ Being able to axiomatize a given body of truths is sufficient but not necessary for establishing its consistency. 
And this method of establishing the consistency of the class of mathematical truths is not a possibility, simply because any given axiomatization is itself a mathematical result and is therefore itself what is described by other mathematical results. 
Setting aside a few Mickey Mouse domains, consistency is either established in a local, block-chain fashion, by comparing statements with other statements in their immediate dialectical vicinity, or by establishing truth. And the idea that consistency is a prerequisite for mathematical truth is a by­product of the mistaken idea that mathematics describes nothing and is simply the closure under the consequence of relation of arbitrary chosen first principles. The truth is that, in mathematics as in other domains, consistency is a consequence of truth, not vice versa.

The differences are far more important than the similarities. Camus held that, since the morality of his parents was now losing its hold, morality was categorically an illusion, and he believed this to entail that life categorically has no meaning. He was wrong on both counts: given only that the bourgeoisie morality that he had as a child proved not to have universal validity, it doesn’t follow that no moral code has any validity under circumstances. And even if this did follow, it would not have the consequence that life has no meaning, since, first of all, life is inherently meaningful and doesn’t require some moral code to make it meaningful and, secondly, since moral codes, despite their occasional uses, seem to be more about draining life of meaning than they are about imbuing life with meaning. Basically, Camus was a closet reactionary with an extremely narrow conception of morality who evidently believed that unless his small town morality wasn’t absolutely perfect, then there was no morality. 
Nietzsche was a different animal. Nietzsche obviously did believe that a lot of the moral codes people accept are basically so much soul-destroying propaganda; and he also believed that, during his lifetime, their lack of legitimacy was quickly becoming apparent. (He was right on both counts.) But Nietzsche was happy about this, his position being that once all of these bunk moralities were finally gone, the authentic, courage-based morality that we all secretly accept could rise to the surface. 
So basically Camus was a Paul Ryan figure who believed that the good life is the convention-based life, whereas Nietzsche believed convention to separate us from our true selves and, therefore, from the good life.

Sartre, hands down. 
Sartre’s message is: |”You are free; deal with it; make the mot of it. Life is a roller-coaster; don’t water down the experience with false attachments.” Which is a good message. Camus, on the other hand, just kind of belly-ached about how amoral Sartre 
and other existentialists were and how life was ‘meaningless’, and such. 
No—life is not meaningless. Camus’ boring little diatribes about how it is meaningless are meaningless. He says the Sisyphus is happy because he has to roll that rock up that hill 
over and over again, the idea being that life is so meaningless that we need 
repetition and circularity to give it meaning. 
Not sure where he got that one from. Don’t care either. Just a misfire. 
Camus is described as an ‘existentialist’, but he is more of a non-existentialist who believes that he is stuck in an existentialist world. He always bemoans various vague failings on the part of modern man, and seems to want to return to some moral order that never existed. Major bore, very downbeat. 
Wrote some ok stories, but the philosophy part is depressing and useless. 
Sartre on the other—bracing and useful. Dissipated the second half of his career writing some egregiously awful Marxist screeds, but his main message —existence precedes essence—is, at the end of the day, the right message for our time—and all other times too, probably.
