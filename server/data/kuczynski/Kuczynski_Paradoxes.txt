# Positions Extracted from "Ninety Paradoxes of Philosophy and Psychology"

## Epistemology & Logic

1. Rationality is inherently reflective; intelligence is not
2. Intelligence answers "what is objectively possible"; rationality answers "what do my limited resources make incumbent on me"
3. Recursively defined terms that contain undefined self-references are meaningless (contain free variables)
4. There is no recursive definition of the class of recursive definitions
5. There is no formal characterization of formal truth
6. Everything can be automated except automation itself
7. 'True of itself' is meaningful only when it abbreviates a non-reflexive construction
8. The Liar Paradox is solved by distinguishing words from underlying propositions
9. Canonical vs. non-canonical descriptions resolve Berry's Paradox
10. Knowledge of the future is based on continuities, not regularities/repetitions
11. Enumerative induction is either non-existent or illegitimate
12. Causation is continuation, not mere constant conjunction
13. Only principled (nomic/causal) generalizations can be confirmed, not accidental ones
14. Logically equivalent statements are not necessarily confirmationally equivalent when one has causal content
15. Goodman's "new riddle of induction" is a non-riddle because induction is based on continuities
16. A belief can be justified without its owner knowing what that justification is
17. Knowledge begins with beliefs that are not themselves knowledge
18. Seeking knowledge involves knowing a description is instantiated without knowing the instance
19. The ability to learn presupposes constitutive (non-acquired) knowledge
20. Acceptance is pragmatic; belief is alethic—they are distinct
21. Beliefs are not justified on strictly statistical grounds but by explanatory power
22. Self-referential thoughts about external objects explain how thoughts with different referents can be subjectively identical and share content
23. Self-ascriptive thoughts of the self-referential kind cannot possibly be false
24. Content externalism leads to absurd consequences about psychological properties
25. Omniscience is an incoherent concept (knowledge of one kind may exclude knowledge of another)
26. The concept of an omniscient decider is incoherent (omniscient beings never decide anything)
27. The Heavy Rock Paradox doesn't undermine omnipotence—incoherent conditions don't count as limitations

## Philosophy of Language

28. Names are non-descriptive mere labels but "pick up" descriptive information through acquisition
29. Semantics vs. knowledge of semantics: same literal meaning can convey different information
30. Frege's Puzzle is solved by recognizing that names carry associated property-sets for speakers
31. Kripke is right about semantics of proper names, but semantic knowledge isn't acquired in a vacuum
32. Bhartrhari's Paradox commits a fallacy—"some things cannot be described" doesn't predicate of any particular object

## Philosophy of Mind & Psychology

33. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms wither when fought, worsen when indulged
34. Attempting not to have certain thoughts makes them more likely (ironic process theory)
35. Self-awareness correlates with both well-being and distress
36. Self-awareness is a precondition for adaptation
37. Optimism is a form of denial rooted in insecurity; self-belief is confidence-driven realism
38. Schizophrenic outcomes differ by country because self-esteem is easier to restore where standards are lower
39. High sex drive in males may reduce sexual success by putting off women
40. People who try to avoid work end up working harder than those who don't

## Social & Institutional Dynamics

41. Losers hyper-value the hierarchies that oppress them to use against climbers
42. The more useless an employee, the more they toe the organization's line
43. Independent writers face a vicious circle: no reviews without popularity, no popularity without reviews
44. Communications technology connects logically while disconnecting emotionally
45. Information can be described without being disclosed, resolving Arrow's Information Paradox
46. US educational funding creates fake employment, not educational improvement
47. Public school funding is soft communism—dead hand of bureaucracy replacing market
48. Less money spent on public schools, the better
49. Self-identified liberals have higher environmental footprints than conservatives
50. Conservatives tend toward eco-friendly do-it-yourselfism; liberals toward group-dependence
51. Progress for humanity often means rendering specific individuals obsolete
52. "Rebels" in societies with few legitimate reasons to rebel are conformists
53. Where rebellion is legitimate, it's dangerous; fake rebels emerge where it's safe
54. Old-guard hippies are the establishment; those they trample are the real rebels
55. Lawyers create the litigiousness that makes lawyers necessary
56. Suicide only hurts those who care about the victim
57. In democracies, people oppress themselves; in non-democracies, government oppresses people
58. Computers eliminating work leads to more work being done
59. Economic efficiency increases unemployment (excluding government-created jobs)
60. Vindictive leaders are less likely to be overthrown than benevolent ones
61. Tenure prevents intellectual freedom by removing incentives and enabling gatekeeping
62. Institutions that exist to solve problems have incentives to prevent solutions
63. Whether an institution solves or prevents problems depends on whether solving creates new business
64. Philosophy departments are inhospitable to solutions because solving one problem doesn't create business for existing personnel
65. Race/gender/gay studies departments exacerbate the tensions they claim to address
66. Hospitals solve problems because there are always more patients
67. Useless laws give states incentive to criminalize populations
68. Possession of small amounts of drugs is punished more harshly than assault because drug laws need to seem necessary
69. Defense lawyers' livelihoods depend on keeping drugs illegal
70. Superabundance of scholarship creates institutional roadblocks to progress
71. People deeply vested in existing scholarship have incentives to suppress genuine insights
72. Bureaucrats requesting "more information" are determined not to help
73. Knowing too much about someone leads to making excuses for them
74. It's only when someone has no merit that it becomes politically obligatory to say they have merit
75. People who should be most grateful are least grateful (they lack integrity)
76. Medium-funny comedians succeed more than actually funny ones
77. The more stringent therapist licensing, the less effective therapists are
78. Psychiatric treatment often causes more harm than it cures
79. Money spent on economic research produces increasingly useless results
80. Lawyers are better at defending the guilty than the innocent
81. Unions prevent job-getting, creating the need for unions to protect job-keeping
82. People with modest responsibilities intentionally underperform to inflate importance
83. Professors withhold information to make it seem more valuable
84. School psychologists must blame students rather than schools to keep their jobs
85. Grassroots movements cannot exist because leaders need pre-existing power
86. Incompetence has survival value (meek inherit the earth)
87. Hyper-competent people are under-promoted; incompetent people are over-promoted
88. The lower someone is in a hierarchy, the more they enforce it against peers
89. People on welfare use Primerica as fake employment to maintain benefits
90. Slackers work harder because they're playing defensive, accepting whatever comes

## Metaphysics & Philosophy of Mathematics

91. Space-time regions don't have places—they are constituents, not occupants, of space-time
92. If an infinitely large class contains one x, chances of choosing x are infinitesimal but not nil
93. Sorites paradoxes are solved by replacing binary predicates with comparatives plus contextual benchmarks
94. A single grain of millet does make a sound—scale-relativity resolves the paradox
95. Motion exists; being "at rest" requires a non-null interval
96. Irresistible forces and unmovable objects are mutually exclusive by definition
97. The Hilbert-Bernays Paradox is resolved: self-referential definitions yield no referent
98. Any finite number can be represented as sum of infinite series, so traversing infinitely many distances in finite time is unparadoxical

## Ethics & Political Philosophy

99. Anti-trust laws hurt consumers when applied to efficient competitors, help when applied to competition-restrictors
100. The more legal right to secede, the less moral right (legitimate laws reduce secession justification)

## Philosophy of Action

101. Imperatival logic has world-to-word direction of fit; alethic logic has word-to-world
102. In imperative logic, validity flows general to specific; in statement logic, specific to general
103. Ross's Paradox is solved by direction-of-fit asymmetry

## Miscellaneous

104. Authors don't believe everything they write—they judge arguments relatively probative
105. The Preface Paradox dissolves because authors write what they judge warranted, not what they believe true
106. Wittgenstein's rule-following paradox collapses into the trivial point that erroneous hypotheses may fit restricted data
107. Quine's indeterminacy thesis presupposes and exposes the brokenness of behaviorist psychology
108. The Barber Paradox proves such a barber cannot exist; Russell's set paradox proves such a set cannot exist
109. The Axiom of Comprehension is not refuted by Russell's paradox—"doesn't self-contain" requires non-reflexive interpretation
110. Fitch's Paradox is not a paradox but a proof that not all truths can be known
111. The Unexpected Hanging Paradox is solved by recognizing "surprise" is relative to information available at each time
