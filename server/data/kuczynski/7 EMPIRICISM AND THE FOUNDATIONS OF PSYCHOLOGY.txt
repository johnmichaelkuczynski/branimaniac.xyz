Q A 
Desires, intentions, and values 
CHAPTER 11 
1.0 What is a desire? I want to eat that piece of cake. If I believed that cake to be made of chalk-dust or mud, I wouldn't want to eat it. The reason: I'd believe that eating it would not be a source of gratification. By the same token, since I believe that eating that piece of cake would be exquisitely pleasurable, I do want to eat it. My desire to eat that piece of cake, I therefore submit, is identical with a judgment on my part: a judgment to the effect that eating it would be pleasurable. 
I don't currently want to drink the contents of that bottle of dishwashing detergent. The reason: I believe that it would bring me no joy and much distress. But I would want to drink from that bottle if I thought it to contain a non-addictive, sideeffect-free elixir that induced a state of euphoria. Conclusion: My desire to abstain from consuming the contents of that battle is a judgment: a judgment to the effect that failing to so abstain would bring me much grief. 
One doesn't have to have a belief to be in an unpleasant state. But one does have to have a belief if one is to have a desire to alleviate or otherwise respond to that state. One doesn't have a desire to take a pill unless one has a belief as to what taking that pill will do. And if one has such a belief, one has the corresponding desire desire. So

Q A 
Intentions are not desires. Empiricists think otherwise. (In a moment we'll say why they think this.) For example, Davidson (2001a) holds that what one intends to do in a given context C is identical with what one most wants to do in C. One's C-intention is one's strongest C-desire. 
This is false. A man sticks a gun in my face and says: "Your money or your life.” I have a choice: lose my money and live or keep my money and die (only to lose it a moment later, when, as I'm lying dead, the robber takes it out of my pockets). 
Do I want to give the robber my money? "Of course, you do," it will be said. "You want to live. And, the circumstances being what they are, you've got to give the man your money if you want to gratify your desire to live. Therefore you want to give him your money." 
I want to live. But that doesn't mean I want to do all the things that are involved in staying alive. Somebody may have to get a leg amputated to live. But they don't want to lose their leg. What they want is to live. They judge that, if they are to gratify their desire to live, they must forego gratification of another, weaker desire. Similarly, I don't want to give the gunman my money. I judge that, given the circumstances, if I am to gratify a relatively strong desire (my desire to live) I must forego gratification of a relatively weak one (my desire to hold on to my money). 
But this is very different from wanting to give the man my money. Desires don't cease to exist when they are outweighed. I want to continue to be a professor. I also 
<

: Q A 
want to have money. My desire to be a professor is more powerful than my desire for money (and exclusive of it). Does that mean that I don't want money? No! If somebody showed up with a briefcase full of money, I couldn't be more delighted. And, with respect to the armed-robbery situation, if a stroke of good fortune were to intervene (if, for example, the gunman were to drop dead of a heart-attack), I couldn't be happier. If, while being robbed, I didn't want to not give the man my money, I wouldn't respond this way. 
"But one can both want to not do something and also to do it," it will be objected. "One can be ambivalent. There is no contradiction in this. What's not possible is for it to be the case both that desires, and has no desire, to do X. But one can want both to do and to refrain from X.” 
Yes, but that isn't what is going on here. I love my mother and thus want to give her a birthday present. But I'm angry at her, since she wrote a negative review of my last book; so I also want to not give her a birthday present. Here we have a case of ambivalence. But this is not what we have in the robbery-situation. I don't simply have a desire to not give the gunman my money. I don't have a desire to give him my money. I see giving him my money as a grim concession I must make to circumstances that I wholeheartedly wish I didn't have to make. 
My intention to give the gunman my money is not a desire. It is a judgment. It is a judgment that I'll be better off if I give the gunman my money than if I don't. Given

him: the gratification it affords him is a by-product of his belief that he's done something valuable. 
In order to become a volunteer fireman, one has to pass various physical fitness tests and examinations, and one must therefore exercise a great deal of self-control at various junctures. Frankfurt would say that, by virtue of my thus exercising selfcontrol, an HOD is dictating my behavior, as opposed to a first-order desire. But my behavior isn't desire-driven in any sense; it's judgement-driven. 
Many a so-called HOD is really a judgment. I hate my supervisor and want to insult him. My refraining from doing so is judgment-driven, not desire-driven and therefore not HOD-driven. I want to have a cigarette. My refraining from doing so is judgment- driven, not HOD-driven. 
This is not to deny that HOD's exist. It is to show that what Frankfurt describes as HOD's are not desires and are in fact judgments, like my judgment to give my money to the stick-up man. 
In some cases, what drives an act of self-denial, of foregoing some pleasure, may be a judgment to the effect that, if one doesn't deny oneself this particular instance of this pleasure, one will in due course have to forego other, greater pleasures. But the operative word here is "judgment." The intention is a judgment concerning my desires; it is not itself a desire. Also, the prospect of pleasures greater than one being foregone isn't always what drives an act of self-denial, as we have seen.

Q A 
3.0 In Chapter 1, we distinguished between object-awareness and truth-awareness. All truth-aware creatures are object-aware, but not all object-aware creatures are truth- aware. We will refer to creatures that are object-aware but not truth-aware (or otherwise proposition-aware) as MOC's – short for "merely object-aware creature." And we will refer to truth-aware creatures as PAC's - short for "proposition-aware creatures." In this section, we will discuss how MOC's become PAC's. 
A preliminary point: Some animals are driven by instincts to kill themselves (e.g. drones instinctively kill themselves so that the queen bee may live). Such instincts conduce to the survival of the species, not the individual. But most instincts conduce to the survival of the individual, or are supposed to do so. Since it is exclusively on instincts of this kind that we will focus, the word "instinct” is to be taken refer to 
instincts of the self-centered, survival conducive kind. 
For MOC's, survival is bodily survival. The same is true for neophyte-PAC's, that is, for PAC's that have only first-order desires. With the installment of second-order desires, there is, for the first time, a cleavage within the organism's mind: there is a conflict between what it wants to do and what it wants to want to do. For neophyte PAC's, desires have the immediate purpose (if we may so speak) of keeping the organism's body alive and well. With each new installment of nth-order desires (n ≥ 2), desires become less and less directly concerned with the survival of the organism's body. 
< 
273-274/476 
Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
: Q A 
As this superstructure grows, the survival of the physical organisms becomes more and more dependent on its welfare, on its integrity. Functions that were previously carried out by lower-level ideation come to be incapable of being carried out except by higher-level ideation. It is a general principle of biology that, the more sophisticated the creature, the more sophisticated the cognitive machinery needed to carry out a given operation. A human being's ability to digest depends on the intactness of brain- structures far more sophisticated than those involved in a snake's ability to digest, even though the former operation is not in and of itself more complex than the latter. It is my hypothesis that the discharging of first-order desires becomes comparably encephalized. More precisely, it becomes increasingly dependent on the gratification of higher-order desires. The execution of superstructure-internal operations becomes a sine qua non for the gratification of first-order desires, even though the latter can be, and used to be, gratified without the help of any such superstructure. 
There thus occurs a reversal. Initially this superstructure existed to keep the physical organism alive. But now the physical organism exists in order to keep this superstructure alive. Initially, the gratification of higher-order, superstructure- internal desires was important only to the extent that it conduced to the gratification of first-order desires. But now the gratification of first-order desires is important only to the extent that it conduces to the gratification of higher-level, superstructure- 
internal desires.

: Q A 
regard Bach's music as more intrinsically valuable than Mick Jagger's because, whereas the latter appeals relatively directly to sexuality-based desires, the former directly appeals directly to rationality-based desires and only relatively indirectly to sexuality-based desires. We see rationality as intrinsically valuable because a superstructure of the kind we've been discussing is only as voluminous, and has only as much integrity, as its operations are rational. And we see the scope and integrity of a given such superstructure as determinative of its value because we see that superstructure as being identical with the relevant person's agency and, therefore, with his very self. It is only to the extent that one's behavior is guided by superstructure-specific desires that one is acting, rather than reflexively reacting. Therefore, it is only to that extent that one is an agent. 
4.0 To value something, I propose, is to see it as conducive to the consolidation or enlargement of one's agency. We value reading Mill more than we value reading Harlequin romances, because we know that, by reading the former but not the latter, we are honing our minds and thus fortifying our agency. We value listening to Bach more than we value listening to hip-hop for the same reason. 
"But what about altruistic values?" it will be asked. "You hold that x values doing y just in case x sees doing y as conducive to the fortification of his agency. But x may value doing y, because he sees it as helpful to others, even though doing y may, as x

is built around a certain of values, self-interested reactions may coincide with genuinely moral reactions. If, in exchange for money, Mother Teresa were poisoning the orphans in her care, her life would be drained in meaning. Her values being what they were, it was in her interest to behave altruistically. So there is less cynicism than is typically thought in the Nietzschean point that morality is an instrument of self- 
interest. 
But there is some cynicism in it. Authentic moral reactions can be expressions of a basal, value-free kind. My colleagues were afraid of losing their jobs; and their moral outrage at the dissolution of the UNLV philosophy department embodied that fear. At the same time, their outrage, even to the extent that it embodied nothing more than a fear of losing a paycheck, embodied genuine morality. We are more indignant at atrocities that occur in our own countries than we are in those that occur in foreign lands, even in cases where we know that the latter are far more serious than the 
former. 
This doesn't mean that morality is to any degree fraudulent. Speaking from an evolutionary perspective, people's senses of right and wrong are enormously important. But for them, our species wouldn't last long, since we'd always be at each other's throats; and even though we establish legal systems that make it one's interest to comply with the dictates of morality, the world would be a very different place, and a much worse place, if those judicial institutions were not reinforced by an 
< 
276/476 
Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
: Q A 
independently existing tendency on the part of people to comply with moral codes. People are more self-interested than moral. So in relative terms morality is a weak force. But in absolute terms it's a strong force, and that is what matters in the present contest. (Gravity is an extremely weak force, being billions of times weaker than those that hold an atom together. But gravity is still, in absolute terms, a powerful force, and in many contexts, what matter's is gravity's absolute, not its relative intensity.) 
4.1 Hedonistic pleasure is value-free pleasure. Accomplishment-based pleasure is not hedonistic pleasure. Hitting a good backhand is a source of accomplishmentbased pleasure, as is solving a tough math-problem. Shooting heroin is a source of purely hedonistic pleasure, as is watching TV. 
197. I don't know what the UNLV President's motivations were in dissolving its philosophy department. But his decision, though surely partly fiscal in nature, may not have been entirely so. Some departments simply cease to be operative and should 
cease to exist. 
The object of desire is gratification. Not all intentions aim at gratification. My intention to write a treatise isn't a desire. It's a judgment that I must write a treatise if 
I am to have a life that embodies certain values. 
Such judgments become desire-like. It is with excitement and joy that a skilled

Q A 
mindless creature cannot experience pleasure or happiness, and that intelligence can be put to practical use. But we see our minds as being intrinsically good. 
This is no more of true of intellectuals than it is of athletes, dancers, and others who measure their self-worth in terms of what their bodies can do. Michael Jordan rightly sees his athletic ability as a characteristic, not of his body, but of his self; and he sees it as redounding not to his body's credit, but to his own. If Michael Jordan were to wake up in another body, it would trouble him only to the extent that his new body might not be as well-suited as his previous one to do the sorts of things that validated his self-concept. 
These facts are to be understood in terms of the fact that athletic ability is cognitive, not somatic in nature. Being coordinated consists in one's mind being intelligent and effective in the way it governs one's body, and athletic ability is therefore a virtue of mind, not of body. 
To be sure, there's more to being an athlete than being coordinated. But many of the other characteristics of athleticism, though by no means all, are ultimately cognitive in nature. A soccer player's knowing when to pass the ball is comparable to Napoleon's knowing where to position his troops, the same being true of a squash player's knowing where to place the ball. Of course, there are some strictly somatic components to athleticism, e.g. endurance, strength, size. And, of course, an athlete must be physically healthy. But even such things as speed are largely cognitive in

identify with their bodies. So up to a point, people do identify with their bodies, and you are therefore wrong to say otherwise.” 
People are indeed proud of facts about their appearance for which they aren't responsible, and they're also ashamed of such facts. But that isn't because they don't identify with their minds; it's because they wrongly regard facts about how they look as embodiments of facts about how they are. Even the most rational and evolved person at some level equates beauty with character and ugliness with its absence. Physically attractive movie stars play good people, and unattractive ones play bad ones. Jimmy Stewart was a good-looking man, but "It's a Wonderful Life" is about George Bailey's excellences of character, not his good looks. Peter Lorre was not a handsome man, but “M” is about Hans Beckert's deficits of character, not his bad looks. On the rare occasions when a good-looking actor's character lacks virtue, or a bad looking actor's character has it, it's because the very point of the movie is that what's on the outside isn't necessarily what's on the inside. The very fact that this ever has to be the point of a movie confirms our hypothesis that people equate good looks with character and bad looks with its absence; and this fact, in its turn, confirms our hypothesis that people regard their appearances as embodiments of their character. 
5.0 I have argued that intentions are judgments as to how to comply with one's values and, therefore, as to how to expand and consolidate one's agency. But there is a

serious problem with this analysis. People intentionally smoke, drink, give into base urges, and otherwise degrade themselves. I must therefore hold that 
(i) The intentions driving debauched acts embody some sort of ignorance. For, if (i) is wrong, then 
(ii) Such intentions are straightforward counterexamples to my analysis. 
But is there any independent reason to accept (i)? Yes. Whenever a person commits an act of debauchery, he rationalizes. Typically, when I'm about to light up a cigarette, I tell myself that: 
(RA) Everybody needs to take a break once in a while. And even though smoking is bad for one's health, I'm fairly sure that I don't do it enough to run any real risk of contracting cancer or emphysema. And to the extent that I'm not sure, it's because I have a neurotic proclivity to doubt, even when there is no reason to do so. 
Like all rationalizations, RA is largely true. People do need to take breaks. People do need to cool off. 98 But I'm taking those truths out of context. There are ways of

: Q A 
One can rationalize only if one has conflicting beliefs. If I knew that RA was spurious, RA wouldn't work. If I knew that this was the cigarette that would give me cancer, RA probably wouldn't occur to me and, if it did, it would be an operationally inert series of thoughts, not a rationalization. 
When a person rationalizes, it is in order to make himself believe that his values validate an act that they do not in fact validate but that he strongly wants to perform. Few rationalizations are complete successes. (When lighting up, do I really believe RA? No – if I did, my mind would be at ease. But I'm anxious.) But seldom are they complete failures. (Although I don't fully accept RA, I accept it enough to have the cigarette.) 
"But how can a person make himself believe something he doesn't believe?" We will answer this question in Chapter 15. For now let us operate on the plausible 
assumption that people can in fact rationalize. 
There are no cases where one knowingly gives into depravity and doesn't rationalize doing so. People often describe what they're doing as "depraved.” But in such cases one of two things is likely to be happening: 
flight, compulsion-mediated flights don't involve one's turning one's back on everything that one knows and feels. Being blind to some things is a necessary for seeing others with maximal sharpness. Somebody whose cognitive field of vision is

QA 
(ii) amplified: To be rendered innocuous, painful knowledge doesn't have to be repressed. It can be intellectualized. Intellectualized knowledge is knowledge that has not itself been repressed but whose emotional concomitants have been repressed. What was previously a painful reality becomes a mere object of consideration. And when delineating the consequences of the hitherto painful truth, one can tell oneself that what one is doing is virtuous: one is honing one's intellect, after all, and thus enlarging one's sphere of awareness and, therefore, one's very self. 
So we do engage in actions that we believe to undermine our agency - but only because, having rationalized, we also believe those actions not to do so and perhaps 
even to consolidate it. 200 
Incidentally, intellectualization is peculiar among neurotic defenses in that those who engage in it come out ahead, whereas those who engage in other such defenses either break even or lose more than they gain. To be sure, there is a downside to intellectualization: one's emotional acuity is blunted. But what one loses in emotional acuity, one more than gains in theoretical acuity. 
Also, the blunting of one's emotional acuity is easily reversed. It isn't by destroying one's emotional acuity that intellectualization blunts it; it is by inhibiting it. Here we must remember Chomsky's (1965) distinction between performance and competence: competence is ability; performance is the ability to deploy ability. It isn't the

reluctant to part. 
QA 
There is an oft-overlooked fact about the intellectual. Often he is accused of being blind to other people's feelings. Sometimes he is guilty of this charge. More often than not the charge is spurious. The intellectual is libidinally self-contained. The validations of others have been replaced by the validations of impersonal logical and ethical norms. The intellectual is often hyper-aware of other people's feelings. But he regards such feelings as being significant only to the extent that they align with impersonal logical and ethical standards. When they do not so align, the intellectual will either have no response to them, except to be dispassionately aware of them, or he will have a justly negative response. Whence the bogus charge of obtuseness. 
Also, those who are likely to level this charge are enraged at the intellectual for his unwillingness to validate their own pettiness. The purpose of the charge is to turn their lack of merit into his: their viciousness becomes his blindness. And the rage behind the charge is projective. The person who levels the charge is ashamed at his own viciousness. He sees in the intellectual an externalization of the part of himself by whose character-indictments he is so tormented. And instead of copping to his deficits and eliminating them - which is always a difficult task, and is usually an impossible one - he does precisely what Nietzsche says he does: he makes vices out of the virtues he doesn's have, but wishes he did, and virtues out of the vices he does have, but wishes he didn't. He describes his own weakness as "empathy," and he describes the

cripple with a volcanic intellect. 
Q A 
Also, whether a given psychological structure is neurotic depends on the context. The very structure that mediates one's neurosis-engendering doubts about one's parents' love for him may mediate one's penetrating epistemological inquiries. Some psychoanalysts hold that a certain amount of neurosis is not only an inevitable concomitant of extreme achievement, but a necessary ingredient for it. For the record, the present author concurs. 
5.1 Sometimes prima facie debauched intentions aren't debauched intentions. Sometimes one's first-order desires must be given free reign; and in duly giving such a desire free reign, one appears to be behaving in a debauched manner, even though one's behavior is integrated and healthy. A person who is incapable of indulging firstorder desires is an emotional cripple - a "stiff," a "square" - a consequence being that emotional non-paralytics inevitably seem on occasion to be wantons. 
A person who can indulge only his first order desires is a degenerate. A person who cannot indulge such desires is a robot. 
First-order desires typically cannot be extinguished; and they should not be extinguished, since they are indispensable to one's psychological vitality. Without them, one's higher-order desires are drained of significance, and one regresses to a condition in which one's higher-order desires are impotent, ironically, but in which

one no longer has intact first-order desires. When a person's first-order desires are over-marginalized, and eventually replaced by what were previously second-order desires, that person regresses to a pseudo-human condition, coincident with the one previously mentioned, sometimes referred to as "sociopathy." (In Chapter 15, it will be explained why the two seemingly distinct routes to sociopathy that we've identified are in fact one and the same.) A person whose first-order desires are overly- restrained, or have been destroyed, is - there is no better way to put it - somebody who longer has a soul; he is somebody who has been over-acculturated - acculturated

"But can't we say that the dog is just very unintelligent," it will be asked, "and counter-evidentially continues to have the same belief?" 
This question likens beliefs to instincts. Instincts persist no matter what; they are experience-insensitive (except in the sense that experience can cause a given creature to instinctually deactivate a given instinct). Beliefs aren't so deeply rooted. New experiences create new beliefs which displace old ones. A so-called belief that exists, and that persists regardless of what its host experiences, is no belief at all. Such a "belief" obviously has its basis entirely in the animal's innate constitution, not its own experience, and is thus an instinct. 
We could say that the greyhound 'instinctively believes that it will catch the bunny. But in that case, everything we're saying about the difference between instincts and beliefs will simply transfer over to the distinction between 'instinctive beliefs' and 'non-instinctive beliefs. 
When not senile or otherwise cognitively impaired, even the most prejudiced people, if given enough information, will modify their beliefs. With the greyhounds at the racetrack, we see compulsive behaviors that are neither initiated nor justified by experience and that no amount of recalcitrant evidence does anything to modify. 
The dog isn't taught to roll over. It is trained to do so. The purpose of training a given creature is to make it have certain kinds of reflexes; it is to create a way of having control over its behavior that by-passes as much intelligence-mediating

mentation as possible. So training is anthithetical to teaching. Rover is an award- winning dog. There isn't a single dog-show in which he hasn't come in first-place. But to the extent that Rover's training influenced his behavior, it "de-mentalized” it: qua trained dog, Rover's intelligence, so far as he had any, ceased to regulate his behavior. Rover's training activated certain reflex-mechanisms and deactivated others. It taught him nothing. 
If a dog is electrocuted every time it puts its mouth around red meat, its instinct to seize nearby pieces of red meat will be put out of commission. But such changes don't reflect any learning on the dog's part. The dog hasn't learned anything. Because of its experience, one set of reflexes has replaced another. No judgment intervened. Operant conditioning isn't teaching. 
Instinct themselves don't change. Whether a given instinct is operative may change. Experience can deactivate an instinct. But an instinct's being deactivated or activated doesn't reflect the acquisition of knowledge; it is itself just another instinctual response to circumstances. So far as instincts embody knowledge, it is of an ancestral (phylogenetic), not a personal (ontogenetic) nature. Instincts are not sensitive to personal experience. 
MOC's can be trained, not taught. Teaching involves the transmission of truths. Since truths are true propositions, MOC's don't grasp truths, since they don't grasp propositions, and they are therefore unteachable.

Person B: So you believe all that Freudian claptrap about unconscious thought. Person A: No! X didn't really think Y. Hence the word "implicitly." 
Person B: I was lying. I'm a die hard Freudian. So did X think Y or not? Person A: Of course! Otherwise I wouldn't have said that he thought it. Those authors who use the term "implicit thought" non-equivocally use it to mean “nonthought." Such authors include Dretske (1982, 1995), Dennett (1978, 1989), and Davidson (2001a, 2001b). According to each, an "implicit thought" is one that a given creature did not have but that would have justified its behavior if it had had it. 
Given that "implicit thought" either means nothing or means "non thought" that expression should be extruded from scientific discourse.

has many desires. Smith comes to have beliefs about his desires. He comes to believe that, if he is to maximize the quality and quantity of gratification that he experiences, he must organize his desires hierarchically; he must make the gratification of certain desires a precondition for the gratification of others and he must simply forego gratification of certain ones. 
A desire is a belief as to how to achieve gratification of a certain kind. (Cf. Chapter 11, Section 1.0.) Smith's belief as to how his desires ought to be organized is itself a desire: a desire about desires.203 It is a tautology that Smith desires to gratify his desires. His belief as to how to organize his desires, so as to achieve maximal

immediate precursors of intentions. 
Q A 
A given person experiments with different ways of hierarchically ordering his desires. Thus, there are changes in respect of what he wants to gratify more than what. At 15, it was more important to me to gratify my desire to go to parties than it was to gratify my desire to play tennis; at 39, it is the other way around. Each person's desire-hierarchy undergoes many permutations. (Up to a point, but not entirely, this is prompted by the acquisition of new desires and the loss of old ones. When I learned how to play the piano, I acquired a desire to play the piano; and that new desire changed my previous desire-ranking. When I improved as a pianist, my desire to play piano intensified, which precipitated another re-ordering of my desires, even though I did not at that juncture gain or lose any desires.) This means that people have 3rd- order desires: desires about their desires about their first-order desires. At age 20, I worked hard on my piano skills and improved a lot as a result. This led to my having more of a desire to gratify my desire to play the piano than I previously had. This did not by itself lead to my having less of a desire to watch movies than I previously had. But I knew that I'd achieve more net-gratification by playing the piano than by watching movies. As a result, I desired to desire to play the piano more than I desired to watch movies. I fulfilled that desire artificially: by playing the piano more frequently than I had before. I did not automatically come to have a greater desire to gratify my desire to play the piano than to watch movies. Here we have some first-

(or at least preserve) one's agency. But, it would seem, we cannot thus reconcile this contention of ours with the fact that people intentionally kill themselves. Sometimes suicides can be at least partially explained in terms of a desire to avoid pain. (Private Smith is surrounded by enemy-troops, and he doesn't want to spend the next 40 years being tortured in a POW-camp.) Let us set such cases aside. They are compatible with our analysis, and they seem not to be psychodynamically comparable to the cases that are relevant in this context cases like Hemmingway's suicide, or Kurt 
Cobain's. 
It is an empirical question why people kill themselves, and it is an empirical question whether there is some one psychodynamic characteristic peculiar to genuinely suicidal people. (Why the word "genuinely"? I believe on empirical grounds that people who unsuccessfully attempt suicide are typically in a very different psychological category from those who actually do commit suicide.) There will thus be an empirical component to my basically speculation-based attempt to compatibilize the fact that people commit suicide with my contention that intentions are judgments as to how

First of all, not all suicide-attempts succeed, and there are obvious differences between real suicide-attempts and fake suicide-attempts. (A person probably was trying to kill himself if he threw himself off of a rooftop; he probably wasn't if he took a few too many Prozacs.) Not every survivor of an unsuccessful, but genuine, suicideattempt is too damaged to discuss the ideation preceding it. For that reason, we have knowledge about such ideation and, therefore, about the similarities between those who unsuccessfully (but genuinely) try to kill themselves and those who succeed in doing so. Given this information, some facts are clear. Suicides are often preceded by psychotic ideation. Successful people are no less likely than failures to commit suicide. Poor people are actually less likely than wealthy ones to commit suicide.

But in so doing, we are delusively seeing as mind-independent facts what are in actuality just facts about our own minds, which have no objective basis. 
Moral nihilism clarified: According to this doctrine, no act is better or worse than any other. If Smith tortures babies for fun, and Jones volunteers his time and medical services to burn victims, what Smith is doing is neither better nor worse than what Jones is doing. What each is doing has no moral value. Nothing has moral value. We have different emotional reactions to different acts. And we project those emotions onto those acts.

Having taught several thousand freshman, I believe that Flew is right, and also that there isn't a middle ground between understanding the Dilemma and not understanding it.

(MA*) Does one believe that moral ideation is non-judicative sentiment? 
one answers "yes" and a rationalist if one answers "no." 
Setting aside degenerate cases psychopaths and musical imbeciles, for example - people's affective and behavioral responses to situations (e.g. seeing a baby be tortured, hearing a Chopin Ballade) indicate that, whatever their discursive views may be, their real views are that some acts are wrong and some pieces of music are good. 
In this chapter, it will be argued that moral nihilism and aesthetic nihilism are wrong. Our objective in doing this is not to show that empiricism is false, which has already been done, but to pave the way for a solid defense of the positions we'll take in connection with the points made in Section 1.0 of this chapter. For reasons that will emerge, a correct understanding of musical and moral ideation is necessary for a correct understanding of those positions and our arguments for them. 
Incidentally, musical nihilism (“no work of music has any merit") is the same doctrine as musical relativism (“all works of music are equally meritorious"). If there is no difference between mere noise, on the one hand, and music, on the other, then all noise is music; and, since mere noise obviously has no musical value, musical relativism entails that no musical work has musical value. On the other hand, if there

validity; and for the same reason mutatis mutandis, one says "x is bad," instead of "x displeases me." Emotional reactions are ipso facto non-cognitive; they embody purely subjective preferences, not judgments, and they are therefore neither true nor false. Moral statements express emotional reactions and therefore express sentiments, not beliefs, and are therefore categorically incapable of being true. 
207. Short for "moral act.' 208. Short for “Hume's position." 
HP is wrong to assume that, if a reaction is 
emotional, it fails to embody a belief; and HP is therefore wrong to assume that, to the extent that moral statements embody emotions, they are 
inherently incapable of being true. HP is, I believe, right to assume that, if empiricism is correct, then emotions are non-cognitive (i.e. aren't judgments or beliefs). But, of course, it is my contention that empiricism is incorrect. And we've seen some reasons, which up to a point are independent of the alleged falsity of empiricism, to hold that emotions are beliefs. There are, of course, significant differences between normative and non-normative judgments. So although the contention that emotions are non- cognitive is false, there is a truth of which it is a misstatement, namely: emotions, though beliefs, are not discursive beliefs. The former are, whereas the latter are not, of a fundamentally egocentric nature.

4.0 "Given only that Hume's meta-ethical views are at odds with our instinctual views," it will be objected, "it doesn't follow that Hume is wrong. To be sure, if we have an intuition to the effect that such and such, that is prima facie evidence that such and such. (In other words, other things being equal, that intuition is to be regarded as true; but that intuition is defeasible - capable of being overridden - since other things may not be equal.) We have intuitions about the structure of space and time; and those intuitions turned out to be disastrously wrong.”209 Moral intuitions track biological facts. A man poisons a reservoir, killing and damaging many. We see that man as despicable and his deed as wrong. Another man devises and implements a way to extract said poison from said reservoir, and he refuses to accept any remuneration. We see that man as noble and his deed as morally 
correct.

209. This is what is often said. Following Reichenbach (1956), I reject it. I don't think we have untutored intuitions to the effect that the structure of space is Euclidean, or even to the effect that space-time is decomposable into space and time. I believe that those "intuitions" are quite as much artifacts of culture-specific educational practices as the contrary intuitions had by those matriculating from post-Einsteinian

descriptive truth. Non-descriptive truths are identical with moral truths. There are no moral differences without descriptive differences. As G. E. Moore (1912) put it, the moral "supervenes" on the descriptive. Stalin was evil. He deliberately caused suffering. Martin Luther King was virtuous. He deliberately alleviated suffering. 
We have observed that moral intuitions track descriptive truths. This fact suggests that moral truths hold in virtue of the same facts as descriptive truths, but that we can experience those facts either as morally anti-septic truths or we can experience them as moral truths. 
An illustration: Smith tortures an infant and Jones does the same. Smith's 
circumstances don't differ in any meaningful way from Jones. Since Smith isn't acting under duress, neither is Jones; and since Smith is laboring under a psychotic delusion (to the effect that he's killing a ghoul, as opposed to an infant), neither is Jones. 
Under these circumstances, it would be absurd to say that Smith's act was morally better than Jones' act or was otherwise morally different from it. 
A closely related fact is that morally good acts are invariably those that conduce to psychological, biological, or psychobiological welfare, the same thing mutatis mutandis being true of bad acts. Smith poisons the reservoir from which people get their drinking water. Smith has obviously acted wrongly. The reason: in so acting, Smith is damaging people. (He is damaging them biologically, and given the severity of the biological damage, he is also damaging them psychologically.) Jones, a physical

bears have white fur that I know that the bear I'm now seeing is a polar bear. Supposing (per impossibile) that one knew exactly how mass-energy were distributed in each region of space-time, would one for that reason have any biological knowledge? No. To have biological knowledge, one needs biological concepts (e.g. organ, respiration, immune system). One doesn't need such concepts to know the physical condition of the universe. (By “physical,” I mean "relating to physics.") If one knows the physical condition of each region of space-time, and one knows how to apply to biological concepts to physics-related truths, then one can figure out that there is a reptile on a certain rock, at a certain time. But by the same token, if one knows the physical condition of each region of space-time, and one knows how to apply to moral concepts to perceptual data, then one can figure that one should prevent Jones from mugging the elderly woman. There is thus no truth to the Moore- Hume contention that you can't derive an "ought" from an "is." 
Those authors thought otherwise because they believed that if P entails Q, there is nothing in Q that isn't in P. We refuted this position in Chapter 3. A brief review of what we said is in order. The proposition that 
(1) x is a circle 
entails that: 
<

Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
Q A 
(2) x encloses a larger area than any perimeter-equal figure 
(3) x is the area enclosed by the class of all points equidistant from a given point (4) x is a closed, 2-dimensional figure of uniform curvature 
and that 
(5) x is shape-coincident with the flat part of the surface of a bisected sphere. The reason that (2)-(5) are logical consequences of (1) obviously isn't that there is nothing in them that isn't in (1). It is that each is a reconceptualization of (1)'s content. In other words, supposing that (1) is true, and that F is the fact in virtue of which it is true, (1) is one way of conceptualizing F, and each of (2)-(5) is a different way of conceptualizing that same fact. The reason that (1) follows from itself is that it is a degenerate case of a reconceptualization of itself, and that is the reason that, unlike one any of (2)-(5), (1) is a trivial consequence of itself. 
5.0 Moral sentiments obviously don't always directly concern one's own welfare. One can make dispassionate moral judgments about long-gone dictators. But such sentiments always have an indirect bearing on one's own welfare.210 When I read about the behavior of Stalin's regime, I know be in terrible trouble if the U.S. government were to act similarly, I'd.

in those other people's shoes would be like for me, for my welfare. To that extent, my belief is egocentric. 
According to Hume, moral judgments are nothing other than these semi-discursive, semi-egocentric judgments. 
Like many authors, the present author thinks that Hume is right about this. The present author also thinks that, even though Hume is for the most part an arch- empiricist, his agreement with Hume on this matter confirms the anti-empiricist viewpoint he is defending in this work. 
According to empiricists, the unpleasant burst of phenomenology awakened by consideration of Stalin's wickedness is just that: phenomenology; mere sentiment. This position is inconsistent with the fact that the phenomenological expressions of moral reactions are in lockstep with non-normative, indisputably objective facts about the things to which one is reacting. Stalin killed many people; he did so for no good reason. His administrative methods deprived people of life, liberty, and happiness. They had ruinous effects on people's biologies (cf. the famine in the Ukraine in the early '30's) and their psychologies (cf. the psychological effects of said famine). These are facts. 
The unpleasant jolt of phenomenology that I have when reading about these atrocities is the expression of an intuitive, non-discursive awareness that I have of the implications that these facts have about human nature. That jolt is an encrypted and 
<

: Q A 
condensed awareness of many facts, e.g. that my circumstances are not so different from those of Stalin's victims, political cataclysms often catch their victims by surprise, even those of their victims who are all too aware that people are more responsive to empty demagoguery than to reason. Those awarenesses take the form of an actiondispositive phenomenological jolt because they place the propositions thereby known in an egocentric cognitive coordinate system, as opposed to an objective one. 
A given person is at the center of his own map 211. Short for "Hume's position." of the world - of his own "cognitive map" to use 
Gareth Evans' (1982) term. He is the point of 
origin. But people can also look at the world objectively - that is, they can locate truths in a map whose viability isn't person-specific. A given truth can be located in an egocentric, self-specific map, or in an objective, person-non-specific map. I can know that 
(MD212) Marge [my wife] has the means, motive, and opportunity to kill me in one of two very different ways: a deracinated purely intellectual way or an experientially integrated way. Knowing it in the first way means locating the corresponding truth in a cognitive map of which I am the center. Knowing it in the second way means locating that truth in a cognitive map that holds no less for you than it does for me. Knowing it in the first way doesn't give rise to fear; it is fear.

The empiricist abhors the very idea of unconscious psychological structure. So he is forced to say of emotion-mediating phenomenology that it is just phenomenology, like the positive sentiment I experience when eating chocolate ice cream. 
But this is deeply implausible. Subtle changes in the situations one considers are accompanied by equally subtle changes in the phenomenologies of one's conscious reactions to those situations. Also, intuitions are, or are expressed in consciousness by, phenomenological nuances; and if given enough time, I can convert any such nuance into a discursive judgment. One possibility is that I am ex post facto reading material into the original intuition that wasn't there. But that is radically implausible, given how much knowledge is intuition-based. If our intuitions were hewed to some finite, frozen body of facts, it could coherently be maintained that intuitions were just sentiments and that, so far as they were accurate, it was by virtue of some sort of (evolutionary-based) pre-established harmony between them and the facts. But since the class of facts tracked by our intuitions is unbounded, along several dimensions, there are ipso facto principled connections between those facts and our intuitions; and given how readily our intuitions lend themselves to discursivization, the

see the snake hissing at me, my conscious response consists of unpleasant, action- dispositive phenomenology. I react, at the level of consciousness, with a feeling. That feeling acts immediately; it speaks unambiguously; it urges me in no uncertain terms to take self-protective measures. Suppose that, instead of having such a powerful and (both temporally and informationally) condensed feeling, my conscious response was to form a nuanced and intricate discursive judgment of the situation and its implications for my welfare: in that case, I wouldn't act quickly enough. I'd be in the position of someone who, instead of being given an electric cattle prod in the back, was given a state-department report to read. I wouldn't react in real time. 
5.1 Not all emotional reactions to a given situation are moral reactions. My beloved father, who recently passed away, used to go to car-races with me. Those were happy times. At such races, there are often car crashes. One day, a few months after my father's passing, I witness a car-wreck. It reminds me of the happy times I spent with my father at the track. So the spectacle of the car wreck makes me feel good. This reaction is not a moral reaction. It may be that, in addition to this positive, non-moral emotional reaction, I have other, negative reactions that are of a moral nature. But our point stands: not just any emotional reaction to a situation is of a moral nature. 
It therefore won't do to say that moral reactions are merely emotional reactions. There is something that distinguishes garden-variety emotional reactions from moral 
<

Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
Q A 
reactions. It's not hard to identify the relevant difference. Why doesn't the positive feeling I have when seeing the car-wreck qualify as a moral reaction? Because it didn't embody a judgment as to the consequences for anyone of that wreck or of events similar to it. 
Suppose that, as a result of witnessing that same disaster, I was appalled at one of the drivers, who I knew to be drunk, his drunkenness being the obvious cause of the 
wreck and of the various fatalities involved. That reaction was of a moral nature. The 
reason: it embodied a judgment to the effect that somebody had certain attitudes (one of cavalier disregard for the welfare of others) and therefore engaged in certain practices (driving drunk) that had ruinous psychobiological consequences for others and, further, that the likes of those attitudes and practices might well have similarly disastrous consequences for me. 
This confirms our point that distinctively moral attitudes are not mere sentiments, but embody judgments. Those judgments turn out to be cogent, when we take the time to articulate them. But when we initially have them, they are consciously experienced only as homogeneous jolts of phenomenology. We thus have to assume that underlying those phenomenological episodes are cogent ratiocinative processes of which we have at most only an obscure awareness. And, as we've said many times, the concept of unconscious ideation is one that empiricists cannot countenance (or, historically speaking, have believed themselves, as empiricists, to be duty-bound to

judgments. It is successful pianists, writers, artists, and scientists who learn to go with their gut feelings. The failures are the ones who are hobbled by conscious, discursive judgments and who turn a deaf ear to the inarticulate feelings that guide their successful counterparts. The latter, but not the former, know how to let their muse take the reigns of agency away from the artifices of a crippled, over-educated conscious faculty of judgment. A person's muse speaks to him through intuitions and gut feelings. Intuitions and gut feelings are, by definition, things for which one cannot find any rational basis at the time of their occurrence. (Sometimes a gut feeling's rational basis emerges with the passage of time.) It is the pedants and phonies who don't write anything unless it has gotten clearance from their actual or internal dissertation adviser or high school math teacher. It is these people who perpetually have that nonexistent condition known as "writer's block." 
6.1 There is no doubt that we have our evolutionary pasts to thank for our abilities to make such speedy and accurate judgments. But that's because of the cognitive endowments thereby bequeathed to us. 
We could say that we "instinctively" exercise these cognitive endowments. But if we say that, we're saying, in direct opposition to the empiricist, that the speedy and typically accurate "feelings" or "intuitions" that we have do indeed embody unconscious judgments.

7.0 Aesthetic nihilism is a consequence of empiricism. According to empiricism, it doesn't exist if it can't be observed. Art cannot be observed. Paintings aren't seen and music isn't heard. Paint is seen and noises are heard. But paintings aren't paint and music isn't noise. A hawk can see the paint mediating Guernica better any person, but a hawk will never see the painting in the paint. If Guernica were a deposit of paint, hawks could see it. They can't; so it isn't. An artistically intelligent person with poor vision is better at seeing the art in the paint than an artistically unintelligent person with good vision. Therefore, one does not in any literal sense see the work of art. For analogous reasons, one doesn't hear music. 
Some composers are better than others. Some works of music are better than others. This doesn't mean that, given any two pieces of music, one is better than the other. In many cases, the works of music are incommensurable: there is no yardstick by which both can be measured. But Mozart and Bach were obviously better composers than many other composers. This fact is obvious to anyone who has so much as a single musical bone in his body.

First of all, not all affective reactions to a musical work are musical reactions. I hate Smith. He is at my house. I know that Smith has a migraine whenever he hears Chopin's Ballade in g-minor. I maliciously blast a performance of that work from my high-tech stereo-system, knowing that soon Smith will be writhing in pain. My reaction to the music, though emotional, is not a musical reaction. (It may also be that, in addition to having this non-musical emotional reaction, I have a distinctively musical reaction. In point of fact, I adore the Ballade in g-minor and, under the circumstances in question, would derive both musical and non-musical delight from the music emanating from my stereo.) 
Another illustration: When I met my beloved wife, I happened to be hearing a performance of the Rolling Stones song Beast of Burden (which, like most critics and many Rolling Stones fans, I believe to be musically mediocre). Since I associate that piece with that happy incident, hearing it always makes me feel good. That emotional reaction is not a musical reaction. It may be that, in addition to making me feel good, hearing that piece arouses negative reactions of a distinctly musical nature. (In actuality, I do have negative aesthetic reactions to that song, the reason being that it's so repetitive and bland.)

Q A 
Both factors are probably operative. People who are completely convinced that aesthetic realism is correct tend to say that it's correct, and people who aren't convinced that it's correct usually aren't being honest with themselves. Sometimes the motivation for such dishonesty is a fear of anti-elitist rage. Sometimes it's a refusal to give up a view of which one believes aesthetic nihilism to be a corollary. 
Exactly similar points hold of moral nihilism. Setting aside moral imbeciles psychopaths, in other words - those who advocate moral nihilism are lying either to themselves or to others; and if they're lying to themselves, it's either because they don't want to have a view that will incur the wrath of others or it's because they believe moral nihilism to be a corollary of a view of theirs that they don't want to give 
up. 
Most moral nihilists are non-psychopaths, but all psychopaths are moral nihilists. In fact, psychopaths are the only true moral nihilists. They are the only ones who, in claiming to moral nihilists, aren't lying either to others or to themselves. 
So far as they aren't false, the corresponding points about aesthetic nihilism are only qualifiedly true. The less musical intelligence a person has, the more he can accept musical nihilism without lying to himself. At the same time, a person with no musical intelligence might genuinely reject musical nihilism, since he might know that his unresponsiveness to music is a consequence of his not seeing what's there, as opposed to there being nothing there. But a person with no moral intelligence could

Q A 
Were it not for our conventions, P wouldn't be ER's meaning and neither would anything else. Since conventions are relations among sapient beings and are therefore mind-dependent, ER's having P or anything else for its meaning is mind-dependent. No convention of ours assigns P to ER or otherwise governs ER as a whole. Our conventions govern ER's simple parts: for each such a part, there is a convention assigning it a meaning. Those conventions being what they are, it logically follows that P is ER's meaning. 
Our conventions are mind-dependent. But given those conventions, it is a matter of mind-independent, logical fact that P is ER's meaning; it is a logical consequence of those conventions. And the fact that P is true is, of course, a matter of mind- 
independent, empirical fact. 
Some truths hold in virtue of relations between minds and non-mental entities. 
Such truths are mind-dependent, but not subjective. Truths concerning the truth- values (if they have any) and the meanings of complex expressions are in this category.

: Q A 
What is such an entity is ER qua relation between conventions and physical entity, the latter being some deposit of ink. And it is inherent in that relation that it be meaningful and that its meaning be P. 
It is not inherent in that relation that ER be true; for the truth of P depends on the relative heights of Mt. Everest and Mt. Rushmore. But there is a three-place relation R such that, given their relative heights, it is inherent in R that it constitute a given token of ER's being truth. So a statement's being true can be thought of as three-place relation, one whose terms consists of human linguistic conventions. 
Thus, nothing follows from the fact that the noises mentioned in SW wouldn't be beautiful in W. For beauty is a property, not of noises, but of relations between minds and noises, and is in this respect just like meaning and truth (with the qualification that truth isn't a relation only between conventions and noises). 
But it isn't merely a theoretical possibility that aesthetic beauty is a property of relations between minds and noises. (Take "noises" to be short for "noises or deposits of ink [etc.].") It seems pretty clear that, our cognitive protocols being what they are, it is fixed which sound-series are beautiful and which ones are ugly. So beauty is intrinsic to relations between cognitive protocols and noises. So SN is as spurious, and it is spurious in the same way, as the statement that:

positions. But though the main contentions of such books are false, those contentions are supported by arguments and considerations that are true or that, if not themselves true, are skillful manipulations of ordinarily truth-conducive methods of reasoning; so that, if only indirectly, the truth is a yardstick with respect to which such books can be evaluated, and evaluated positively. But nothing comparable can be said of music. A musical work is just a series of non-linguistic, meaningless sounds. How can it be said that Beethoven's 9th is any more veridical than the sound of a jack-hammer? And how, therefore, can it be said that any intelligence is embodied in Beethoven's 9th?219 
Admittedly, there is an objection to this line of reasoning, to wit: Frank Lloyd Wright's buildings do not in any literal sense say anything. But surely there intelligence embodied in them. And, it might be alleged, the same thing mutatis mutandis could be said of Beethoven's 9th. 
217. I do not mean to slight great jazz or rock 'n' roll musicians. No value judgment is implicit in my mentioning Schubert, as opposed to David Bowie. It is only because I happen not to be entirely ignorant of classical music that my references are to the classical greats, not to the jazz greats or the rock greats.

developed that its survival and growth became ends unto themselves, and the gratification of one's first-order desires and one's physical welfare became nothing more than means to the preservation, consolidation, and development of one's agency. One's survival instinct was transferred, from one's body to one's self, one's self being the rationality-constituted superstructure whose purpose, when it was still relatively undeveloped, was to ensure the organism's physical survival by regulating the order and manner in which first-order desires were gratified but whose purpose, once it was developed, came to be to be to hone itself and to increase the scope of its powers and responsibilities. 
The essence of agency is rationality. Things that react aren't agents. Reflexive behaviors aren't actions; reflex machines aren't agents; animals are reflex machines; rational agents are not. 221 To be an agent is to be something that acts. Something that reacts is, to that extent, sub-agential. We will refer to things that merely react as "reagents."222 
Being an agent, as opposed to a reagent, involves being proposition-aware, as opposed to merely object-aware. Things (rocks, trees, etc. displacements thereof) are the objects of object-awareness. Things don't imply anything;

what one believes the consequences to be of behaving in that way as opposed to other ways. It follows that only PAC's can have intentions; for intentions are identical with decisions, give or take some irrelevant linguistic nuances. It also follows that only PAC's can deliberate; for deliberation is nothing other than arriving at a decision. 
Incidentally, it is often said that not all intentions follow a process of deliberation. This is almost certainly true. (I say "almost certainly" because I don't wish to rule out the possibility, which I see as more than a strictly theoretical one, that even apparently instantaneously occurring intentions are preceded by rapid, sub-personal ratiocinations.) But I'm inclined to believe that, when an intention is not preceded by a process of deliberation, that is because the relevant sorts of deliberation have already occurred, making it unnecessary to repeat them in this particular instances. These are not new points. Aristotle said that agency was "practical rationality" – that decisions were merely the conclusions of non-theoretical thought-processes. Kant said the same thing. So in saying that intentions are judgments, I am affirming a point that, in addition to being defensible on its own terms, has a venerable heritage, notwithstanding its incompatibility with some contemporary views. 
Conclusion: Agency is rationality. To be more exact, it's applied rationality. There is no intrinsic difference between practical rationality (agency) and "theoretical" rationality. The only difference is that practical ratiocinations eventuate in conclusions that bear on the subject's own welfare, whereas so-called theoretical

ratiocinations do not, except in derivative or accidental ways. Practical ratiocinations are perhaps more likely to be corrupted by prejudices and other emotional factors. But practical ratiocination, qua ratiocination, is indistinguishable, except in the one respect just mentioned, from purely theoretical ratiocination.

Here's what we didn't say about rationality, or said only obliquely. 223 So far as consciousness is representational, it represents things by depicting them; iconic representation is the only form of representation of which conscious ideation is capable. Consciousness is mediated by phenomenology, and – it is clear, though it is not clear why it is clear – phenomenology can represent a given thing only by resembling it. Consciousness qua consciousness - consciousness qua phenomenology-constituted medium - is incapable of conception. Obviously we can consciously think conceptually; but consciousness is not inherently capable of conception. It is inherently capable only of iconic representation. And it is capable of conception only if supplemented in a way that we are now in the process of describing. 
The subpersonal, however, is inherently capable of conception. Not all percipient beings are capable of conception at the personal level of ideation. (Henceforth, I'll use the term "personal" as short for "at the personal level of ideation." So the word
