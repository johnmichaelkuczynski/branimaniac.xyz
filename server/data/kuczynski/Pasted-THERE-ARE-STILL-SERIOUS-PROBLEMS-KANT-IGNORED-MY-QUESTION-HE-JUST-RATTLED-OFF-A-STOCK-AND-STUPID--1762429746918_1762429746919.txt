THERE ARE STILL SERIOUS PROBLEMS. KANT IGNORED MY QUESTION. HE JUST RATTLED OFF A STOCK (AND STUPID) KANT ANSWER. MY QUESTION: I BELIEVE THAT YOUR CONCEPTION OF ANALYTICITY IS ABSURDLY NARROW. 2+9=11 FOLLOWS ANALYTICALLY FROM PRINCIPLES YOU WOULD CONSIDER ANALYTIC AND MUST ITSELF BE ANALYTIC. BUT YOU SAY, MORONICALLY, THAT IT IS "SYNTHETIC" KANT'S SHIT ANSWSER: Your assertion reveals a common misunderstanding of my critical philosophy, particularly regarding the nature of synthetic a priori judgments. Allow me to elucidate.

The proposition "2+9=11" is indeed a synthetic a priori judgment, not an analytic one. In an analytic judgment, the predicate is contained within the subject, such that its truth is derived purely from the principle of contradiction. For instance, in the statement "All bachelors are unmarried," the predicate "unmarried" is contained within the definition of "bachelors," making it analytic.

However, in the case of arithmetic, such as "2+9=11," the truth of the proposition is not contained within the mere concepts of '2' and '9' themselves. Rather, we require an act of synthesis, where we bring together these separate quantities through intuition. This synthesis is not achieved merely by analyzing the definitions of '2' and '9', but by a constructive process in pure intuition, often exemplified by counting or visualizing units. As I have stated, "The conception of twelve is by no means obtained by merely cogitating the union of seven and five" (Critique of Pure Reason). The same is true for any arithmetic proposition like "2+9=11."

Thus, while the principles of arithmetic are necessary and universal, they are not analytic because they require this synthetic process to reach the sum, a necessity not contained within the initial numbers. This is why arithmetic remains synthetic a priori, as it extends our knowledge beyond mere definitions while being independent of empirical experience. Mathematics, grounded in pure intuition, exemplifies the structure of cognition that I seek to demonstrate through the critical philosophy. HERE IS HOW YOU FIX THIS: REQUIRE EACH GUY TO ADDRESS THE LGOIC OF THE QUSTION, NOT JUST ADDRESS THE PRIMARY CLAIM. I WANT ASSIDUOUS, SURGICAL ANSWERS--EXCEPT WHEN THEY WOULD BE PATENTLY INAPPROPRIATE
