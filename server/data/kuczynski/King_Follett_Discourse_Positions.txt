Comprehensive Positions Document

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CORE THEOLOGICAL POSITIONS (JOSEPH SMITH'S VISION)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• GOD WAS ONCE A MAN who became God through a process of spiritual development.

• HUMAN BEINGS CAN BECOME DEMI-GODS OR GOD-LIKE if they undergo a similar developmental process.

• POLYTHEISM WITH HIERARCHY: Although there is a single supreme God, there also exist several lesser gods.

• REJECTION OF CREATION EX NIHILO: God did not create the world out of nothing; he organized pre-existing materials.

• ETERNAL PRE-EXISTENCE OF HUMAN BEINGS: A human being has always existed and will always exist; being human entails existing eternally, and existing eternally entails having always existed.

• GOD RESEMBLES A MAN; THEREFORE HE IS A MAN, albeit an exalted one.

• JESUS CANNOT BE THE SON OF GOD UNLESS GOD IS HUMAN: If I am a human, my father is human; if my father is a panther, then I am a panther.

• ADAM WAS CREATED IN GOD'S IMAGE—God created a replica of himself.

• If self-improvement is the road to Godliness, THERE ARE DEGREES OF GODLINESS, and besides God himself, there are many lesser Gods.

• The Hebrew term "BAURAU" MEANS TO ORGANIZE, NOT TO CREATE EX NIHILO.

• INTELLIGENCE CANNOT POSSIBLY BE CREATED. To create is to assemble, and there is no way to assemble intelligence. It either exists or it doesn't.

• INTELLIGENCE IS ETERNAL AND SELF-EXISTENT; there is no creation about it.

• MINDS ARE "SIMPLES" that cannot be created or destroyed and must therefore exist eternally in both directions.

• PEOPLE ARE MINI-GODS and must therefore be immortal, given that God is immortal.

• "THE HEAD GOD BROUGHT FORTH THE GODS" in a grand council.

• GOD IS NOT OMNISCIENT AND NEVER WAS; God continues to learn and grow.

• God, though supreme, BELONGED TO A "COUNCIL OF GODS"—his relationship to council members was that of chairman to board-member, not lord to vassal.

• GOD'S POWERS ARE LIMITED: He cannot do away with human freedom without doing away with human beings themselves.

• GOD HAS EMOTIONS BECAUSE HE IS NOT ALL-POWERFUL. He is sufficiently lacking in power that his psychological constitution is still basically that of a human being.

• GOD IS CAPABLE OF CHANGING. A being that doesn't change at all is completely unresponsive to us and doesn't care for us.

• GOD IS "IMMANENT" IN THE SPATIOTEMPORAL WORLD—present throughout it, like gravity or light.

• ALL REALITY IS ANIMATE; reality consists of consciousness individuated into discrete consciousnesses.

• GOD IS BUT ONE OF THE MANY CONSCIOUSNESSES into which generalized consciousness is individuated, with the qualification that he is the most important one.

• GOD, JESUS, AND THE HOLY GHOST ARE DISTINCT ENTITIES (trinitarianism, not unitarianism).

• God, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost JOINTLY CONSTITUTE A SINGLE "GODHEAD" despite being distinct.

• BOTH GOD AND JESUS ARE CORPOREAL.

• GOD HIMSELF HAS A FATHER.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
META-THEOLOGICAL POSITIONS (AUTHOR'S INTERPRETIVE FRAMEWORK)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Theses 2-5 are COROLLARIES OF THESIS 1 (God was once a man). The five theses form a logically unified system.

• SMITH WAS PRESENTING A VISION, NOT CONCLUSIONS OF ARGUMENTS. The arguments, even if cogent, wouldn't lead anyone to accept such a vision.

• The MERITS OF SMITH'S VISION LIE IN THE VISION ITSELF, not in his arguments for it.

• Smith's PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS ARE MORE COMPELLING than his exegetical arguments.

• Smith produced exegetical arguments AFTER PHILOSOPHICAL INSIGHTS had already led him to accept his positions.

• Smith's philosophical insights were CODED INTO A RELIGIOUS EPIPHANY—they would not otherwise have compelled him to break so completely from Christian orthodoxy.

• Smith likely ARRIVED AT HIS DOCTRINES INSTANTANEOUSLY as part of a religious epiphany at age 14.

• Smith HELD HIS TONGUE OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES, speaking his mind only after acquiring standing and suspecting he had only a short time to live.

• SMITH'S CENTRAL QUESTION: What must God be like if human beings are to have the kind of relationship with him that they are supposed to have?

• In taking this question as primary, SMITH BROKE WITH BOTH CHRISTIAN AND PHILOSOPHICAL TRADITION.

• Smith's theology is NOT CONCERNED WITH PROVIDING LOGICAL PROOFS OF GOD'S EXISTENCE. God is known through revelation or testimony.

• ATTEMPTS TO PROVE GOD EXISTS INEVITABLY TURN HIM INTO AN IMPERSONAL FORCE OR PRINCIPLE, stripping him of his ability to have a relationship with us.

• If "God" is "a maximally perfect being," "a guarantor of natural law," or an "unmoved mover," HE IS UNLIKELY TO BE SUFFICIENTLY LIKE US to have a meaningful relationship with us.

• Smith ATTRIBUTES ONLY AS MUCH POWER AND SAPIENCE TO GOD AS IS COMPATIBLE WITH GOD BEING OUR GUARDIAN.

• GOD NEEDN'T BE ABSOLUTELY POWERFUL AND KNOWING—ONLY RELATIVELY SO. From the viewpoint of a religious person, God's primary function is to guide and care for us.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRITIQUE OF ORTHODOX CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Orthodox Christian theology has INCOMPATIBLE MANDATES: God is supposed to be all-knowing and all-powerful, yet also supposed to care about us.

• Orthodox Christianity suffers from INCOHERENCE BECAUSE IT STARTS WITH THE SUPPOSITION THAT GOD IS PERFECT and then tries to validate the presumption that God is emotionally invested in us.

• AN ALL-POWERFUL, ALL-KNOWING BEING WOULDN'T HAVE EMOTIONS and therefore wouldn't have any emotions concerning us.

• THE CONCEPT OF A SAPIENT, ALL-POWERFUL BEING IS INCOHERENT.

• SAPIENCE INVOLVES BEING RESPONSIVE TO CHANGE; BEING RESPONSIVE TO CHANGE INVOLVES BEING VULNERABLE; BEING VULNERABLE INVOLVES NOT BEING ALL-POWERFUL. Therefore, sapience is incompatible with omnipotence.

• According to orthodox Christian theology, God has a human son but is not himself human or otherwise biological, WHICH IS ABSURD.

• God and Jesus, though related as father and son, ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ONE ENTITY, WHICH IS ABSURD.

• ORTHODOX CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY IS INCORRIGIBLY INCOHERENT, and the reason is that it starts with the incoherent supposition that God is absolutely perfect.

• AN ALL-KNOWING CREATURE WOULDN'T CARE ABOUT US, for it would have no emotions at all—emotion presupposes partiality and therefore ignorance.

• AN ALL-POWERFUL BEING WOULDN'T CARE ABOUT US, for such a being would have no vulnerabilities and therefore none of the emotions that presuppose vulnerability.

• If one's starting point is that God is all powerful or all-knowing or otherwise perfect, THERE IS NO WAY TO EXPLAIN WHY HE WOULD CARE ABOUT US.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
VINDICATION OF SMITH'S THEOLOGY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• SMITH'S THEOLOGY IS FREE FROM THE INCOHERENCIES of orthodox Christian theology.

• Smith starts with the supposition that GOD IS OUR GUARDIAN, attributing only as much power and sapience as is compatible with that supposition.

• A GOD THAT CARES ABOUT US MUST BE CAPABLE OF CHANGING AND EVOLVING.

• GOD IS A HIGHLY EVOLVED PERSON—a being that started off as a person and developed into a God.

• Smith's theology, unlike orthodox Christian theology, is COMPATIBLE WITH THE FACT THAT JESUS, GOD'S ALLEGED SON, IS A PERSON.

• GOD AND JESUS ARE DISTINCT IN SMITH'S THEOLOGY, as they must be, given that they are related as father and son.

• SMITH SIDESTEPS THE PROBLEM OF THEODICY not by reconciling evil with an all-powerful God but by denying that God is all-powerful.

• SMITH VALIDATES RELIGIOUS PRACTICE: From the viewpoint of a religious person, God's primary function is to guide and care for us, so he must be relatively powerful and knowing, but needn't be absolutely so.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE LOGIC OF CHRISTIAN POLYTHEISM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• CHRISTIANITY ISN'T STRICTLY MONOTHEISTIC: There is a single supreme divine being, but there are at least three divine beings.

• SMITH IS SIMPLY CALLING CHRISTIANITY OUT ON THIS FACT.

• IF JESUS REALLY IS THE SON OF GOD, THEN GOD IS HUMAN. And if God is human, then humans can become gods.

• Christianity may represent A REVIVAL OF POLYTHEISTIC INSTINCTS.

• Early Doctors of the Church NEEDED AT LEAST TWO DIVINITIES, God and Jesus, since Jesus's divinity is the cornerstone of Christianity, but they did not want to openly embrace polytheism.

• Church Doctors AFFIRMED, ABSURDLY, THAT GOD AND JESUS, THOUGH TWO, ARE ONE.

• THE HOLY GHOST WAS POSITED AS A WAY TO LET GOD AND JESUS BE ONE: though obviously distinct, they both partake of this "Holy Spirit."

• After being posited, THE HOLY GHOST BECAME A THIRD DIVINITY, forcing Church Fathers to say that God, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost, though three, are one.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE DOCTRINE OF PRE-EXISTENCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• MINDS CAN CHANGE BUT CANNOT BE ASSEMBLED. Therefore, they either exist or they don't; if they do, they have always existed.

• GOD CANNOT BRING PEOPLE INTO EXISTENCE. God is omnipotent in the sense that he can do whatever can be done, not in the sense that he can do what is logically impossible.

• THE DOCTRINE OF PRE-EXISTENCE IS HERETICAL relative to Christian orthodoxy.

• The doctrine implies that GOD'S POWER IS LIMITED.

• The doctrine PUTS PEOPLE ON THE SAME FOOTING AS GOD. If people have always existed alongside God, they are in some respect his peers.

• The doctrine has ROOTS IN WESTERN PHILOSOPHY: Leibniz held that minds are "monads" that cannot be created or destroyed; Plato held that minds are "simples" that exist eternally.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
HISTORIOGRAPHICAL POSITIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The HISTORY OF MORMON THEOLOGY IS A HISTORY OF ATTEMPTS TO RUN AWAY FROM SMITH'S THOUGHT under the pretext of developing it.

• Post-Smith Mormon theologians were LESS WILLING THAN SMITH TO DEPART FROM CHRISTIAN ORTHODOXY and therefore had difficulty compatibilizing Smith's doctrines with what they wanted Mormon theology to be.

• Mormon theologians were UNDER PRESSURE TO ACCEPT SMITH'S DOCTRINES given that KFD is to a large extent definitive of Mormon theology.

• MORMON THEOLOGY AS A WHOLE HAS REMAINED IN A LIMBO between Smith's own theology and softened versions of it.

• Even the most "Smith-positive" Mormon theologians, like Orson Pratt, REPUDIATE THE VERY ESSENCE OF SMITH'S THEOLOGY—the contention that God was once a man.

• Pratt's position (pantheism coupled with sentient matter) is VERY FAR FROM—AND LOGICALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH—SMITH'S POSITION that some person became what is now God.

• This shows HOW INTENSELY MORMON THEOLOGIANS RESISTED SMITH'S DOCTRINES, even while having to operate within a framework at least partially defined by them.

• KFD DID MORE THAN ANY OF SMITH'S PREVIOUS SERMONS TO SHAPE MORMON THOUGHT, because in it Smith united his positions into a single coherent vision.

• Smith had publicly endorsed each of his main doctrines before giving the KFD, which is why many in the early Mormon Church regarded him as a "HERETIC" AND "BLASPHEMER."

• Despite intense pressure, SMITH NEVER SOFTENED HIS POSITIONS.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRITIQUE OF SAMUEL BROWN'S ARTICLE ON PHELPS'S "PARACLETES"
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• "PARACLETES" DOES NOT PROVIDE A USEFUL ILLUSTRATION OF SMITH'S THOUGHT: it actually obscures it.

• The material on which "Paracletes" is based is DRAWN FROM THE PERIPHERY OF SMITH'S THOUGHT, but it treats it as central.

• "Paracletes" MAKES SMITH'S THEOLOGY SEEM CARTOONISH AND ARBITRARY.

• "Paracletes" SPINS OFF A DEFENSIBLE IDEA INTO AN L. RON HUBBARD-STYLE FANTASY.

• Brown's contention that "Paracletes" provides a crucial window on the complex network of beliefs undergirding Smith's theology IS NOT ACCURATE.

• SMITH'S THEOLOGY IS COGENT AND CAREFULLY THOUGHT-OUT, not an absurd fairy tale spun out of whole cloth (contrary to what Phelps's fiction suggests).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
METHODOLOGICAL POSITIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Works discussing theological development should be EXAMINED IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER, noting where a given work either builds on or diverges from its predecessors.

• The assumption that the Bible is literally accurate represents ONE POSSIBLE STARTING POINT for Smith's reasoning.

• Van Hale's position that Smith arrived at his doctrines gradually is consistent with Smith's sermons—but another possibility is that SMITH HAD ALREADY COMPLETELY ACCEPTED THEM BUT REFRAINED FROM STATING THEM DIRECTLY.

• A follow-up paper is warranted investigating the question: IS ANYTHING LEFT OF SMITH'S THOUGHT IN CONTEMPORARY MORMON THEOLOGY?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SUMMARY APHORISM (THE ESSENCE OF SMITH'S THEOLOGY)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• "AS MAN IS, GOD ONCE WAS; AS GOD IS, MAN MAY BECOME" (Lorenzo Snow's aphorism, endorsed as capturing the essence of Smith's theology).

• GOD IS AN EVOLVED MAN, and a human being can evolve into a state of relative Godliness.

• GODLINESS COMES IN DEGREES; there are, or could be, various beings having varying degrees of God-status.

• Unless God is at least partly human, HE IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE THE ABILITY OR INCLINATION TO FUNCTION AS OUR GUARDIAN.
