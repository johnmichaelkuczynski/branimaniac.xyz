Advances in Consciousness Research (AiCR) 
Q A 
Provides a forum for scholars from different scientific disciplines and fields of knowledge who study consciousness in its multifaceted aspects. Thus the Series includes (but is not limited to) the various areas of cognitive science, including cognitive psychology, brain science, philosophy and linguistics. The orientation of the series is toward developing new interdisciplinary and integrative approaches for the investigation, description and theory of consciousness, as well as the practical consequences of this research for the individual in society. 
From 1999 the Series consists of two subseries that cover the most important types of contributions to consciousness studies: 
Series A: Theory and Method. Contributions to the development of theory and method in the study of consciousness; Series B: Research in Progress. Experimental, descriptive and clinical research in consciousness. 
This book is a contribution to Series A.

Q A 
a fool's errand. The external world would be nothing more than a collection of mutually disconnected, ex nihilo events if all there were to it was what observation revealed. To the extent that a scientist complies with the empiricist credo that one must “stick to the facts,” he cannot embed observable events in otherwise unobservable continuities. Thus forced to hold that such events occur spontaneously, he is ipso facto incapable of explaining them and, therefore, of restoring to the external world the integrity of which raw observation has stripped it. 
Similar but more extreme points hold of the internal world. If completely described by the information borne in his conscious experiences, a given person's mind would consist of spontaneities internal to stretches of consciousness that, flanked by lapses in consciousness, would themselves be spontaneities. Not permitted to embed

1. In this context, the word "observation” refers to sensory observation – sight, audition, touch, etc. - and also to non-sensory, but direct experience, such as one has of one's pains, tickles, and conscious mental images. 
conscious events within otherwise unconscious psychological continuities, the empiricist is ipso facto incapable of explaining them and, therefore, of restoring to the mind the integrity of which conscious introspection has stripped it. 
1.2 Of course, the mind is but one small part of a larger reality. Since mental events

are obviously mediated by physiological structures, it is widely held that the mere existence of such structures accounts for the discontinuities within conscious 
experience. According to this viewpoint, absorbing the mental into the physiological eliminates the pockets of nothingness that pervade conscious experience, and there is thus no need to embed unconsciousness-flanked bouts of consciousness, or the events 
internal to such bouts, in otherwise unconscious psychological continuities: the data is adequately modeled by citing the independently verified fact that consciousness is mediated by continuously existing, explanatorily intact physiological structures.2 
1.2.1 This line of thought involves four oversights. First, it doesn't distinguish the 
statement that: 
(i) X's parts are governed by laws L...Ln 
from the non-equivalent statement that: 
(ii) X itself is governed by Ln... L. Second, it doesn't distinguish the statement that: (i*) X complies with the same laws as Y, 
from the non-equivalent statement that: 
(ii*) X-internal events are to be explained in terms of the same principles as Y- 
<

Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
Q A 
distinguish between (i)/(ii)/(a)/(A) and (i*)/(ii*)/(b)/(B). No two of these contentions perfectly coincide, but any given two of them are near corollaries of each other. 
1.2.2 
The term "mediate" occurred in Section 1.2, and it will often occur in the pages to come. Before proceeding, I must say exactly what I mean by that term, and I will take the opportunity to say exactly what I will mean by a few other terms that will frequently occur in this book. Those terms are "proposition," "fact," "thing," "object" "concept," "property" and "universal.” 
To say that that x "mediates" y is say that y's existence constitutively depends on x's. By this it is meant that the things composing y are identical with (a subset of) the things composing x. Your house would cease to exist if the bricks composing it ceased to exist. So your house's existence depends on that of those bricks. But those bricks don't cause your house to exist. Your house's existence is therefore not causally, but constitutively, dependent on that of those bricks. 
A "proposition," as I will be using this word, is what one affirms when one makes a statement. If I say "snow is white," I am affirming the proposition that snow is white. That proposition is not identical with the sentence "snow is white," or with any other sentence. (That is why that proposition can be the meaning of distinct sentences, e.g.

of mass-energy. The proposition that Jim just had a heart attack holds in virtue of that redistribution of mass-energy. So that proposition is a truth and that redistribution of mass-energy is a fact. That fact is not identical with that truth. It remains a truth that Jim had a heart attack, but the corresponding fact is no more. Given any truth, a similar argument shows that it is distinct from the fact in virtue of which it holds. 
For an object of a certain kind to exist is for mass-energy to be allocated in a certain way. Therefore, changes in objects are redistributions of mass-energy. But I will use the term “redistribution of mass-energy" to refer to any change, even ones that involve object-free energy-fields. 
Some truths (e.g. the cat is on the mat) hold in virtue of static situations and, therefore, in virtue of static allocations of mass-energy. Such facts are mere distributions, as opposed to redistributions, of mass-energy. I will use the word “fact” to refer to both distributions and redistributions of mass-energy. I will often use the term “(re)distribution of mass-energy,” leaving it to the context how it is to be disambiguated. 
An event is nothing other than a redistribution of mass-energy. Therefore, we will use the word “fact” to refer to events, as well as to objects, and also to static assemblages thereof. 
We will use the word "thing" to refer to rocks, trees, and other similarly “concrete"

letting P1...P be any physicalistic statements (statements concerning the spatiotemporal realm that involve no concepts such as perception, shame, hope, etc.) and letting M1...Mm be any mentalistic statements, there is no way to understand why P1...P, given that are true, M1...M should also be true. So I am an explanatory dualist, if not an ontological dualist. 
Why do I accept materialism (of the ontological, not the epistemic variety)? The physical world is causally closed. Whatever affects it is physical, and so is whatever it affects. The mental affects the physical. So the mental must be physical. Smart (1959) puts forth this argument, as does Fodor (1968).

Propositions consist of concepts. The proposition: Smith is taller than Jones, but Jones is more intelligent than Smith consists of the concepts tall, intelligent, etc. The concepts of life, death, respiration, etc. fall within the scope of medicine, and so do the propositions that they compose. So the medical researcher explains why (4) is true. But he doesn't thereby explain why the corresponding microphysical propositions are true, since the concepts spin, charge, etc. don't fall within his field of study and neither, therefore, do the propositions they compose. 
The fact in virtue of whose existence (4) is true consists of events of precisely the sort that the microphysicist explains (displacements of tiny quanta of energy). The microphysicist is in principle capable of explaining propositions that hold in virtue of those facts. But those propositions consist of concepts like charge and wavicle, none of which are to be found in any physiological statement. 
For the physiologist, the truth of the proposition 
(6) Anderson has severe asthma and he just smoked a pack of cigarettes. accounts for the truth of (4). For the microphysicist, (6) doesn't even exist, and neither does (4).

1.2.5 Everything just said about the relationship between physiology and microphysics holds of the relationship between psychology and physiology. But there is a respect in which in the latter two disciplines are even more remote from each other than the first 
two. 
Physiological data are given to one as holding in virtue of events having certain locations in a certain coordinate system. (Smith has a heart attack in a certain place, at a certain time.) Microphysical data are given to one as holding in virtue of events having certain locations in that same coordinate system. There is some one coordinate system CS such that, given any proposition P belonging to either discipline, P represents the facts (if any there be) in virtue of which it is true (supposing it true) as being in that coordinate system. (From now on, I'll leave out the parenthetical qualifiers.) Every proposition of every discipline other than psychology represents the facts in virtue of which it is true as being in CS. 
But psychological propositions categorically don't present the facts in virtue of which they hold as being in CS. The collision of billiard balls A and B is given to you as having a certain location in space-time. But your perception of that collision, though given to you as occurring in the same temporal manifold as the collision, isn't given to you as occurring in the same spatial manifold.

Indeed, the term "empirical thought" is an oxymoron.

For example, it's extremely difficult to find any philosopher who concedes that anything makes anything happen. They all accept the following, distinctively empiricist line of thought, first put forth by Hume (1739):

Q A 
The Salmon-Soames view is obviously contraindicated. Fortunately, it is easily avoided. We've already seen why: it isn't John per se that is a property of JT; it is the property of being John. When John ceases to exist, that property ceases to be instantiated, but it doesn't cease to exist. 
"But why the need for c1...c4?", it will be asked. "cz's being instantiated is necessary and sufficient for JT's being true. So why not identify JT with c5 and JT's being true with cs's being instantiated?"18 
2.1.2 
17. Russell (1917) makes this very point and says that, indeed, there is some proposition of which is a constituent and that proposition is non-operational. See the chapter in Russell (1917) titled "Knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description." 
18. David Lewis (1984) identifies the proposition Smith is tall with the property of being a thing x such that Smith = x and x is tall. Lewis' position is basically correct; but it needs to be augmented, as we're about to see, in order to accommodate the fact that propositions must tend 
JT contains a discrete part corresponding to John and another discrete part corresponding to the property of being tall. Those constituents of JT can be detached

and 
(ST20) "Sally is tall," 
respectively. Our analysis thus validates the fact that the relations holding among JT, SW, and ST mirror those holding among the corresponding propositions. 
The raison d'être for C3, C4, and c5 is to be understood along similar lines. JT formally entails: 
(ET21) Something is tall. 
JT also formally entails: 
(SS22) Something has some property. 
JT, ET and SS are propositions, not sentences. The traditional wisdom is that formal entailment holds among expressions, not propositions. But we've just seen that it holds among propositions. In Chapter 2, Section 7.2, we'll find that, in addition to holding among propositions, formal entailment fails to hold among sentences or,

indeed, expressions of any kind. Statements to the effect that a given sentence is "formally true," or that a given statement-sequence is "formally valid," are either meaningless or is an abbreviated ways of making statements about propositions. 
2.1.3 Attempts have been to show that properties are identical with spatiotemporal entities. For example, some hold that a given property is identical with a spatiotemporal entity whose constituents are that property's instances. 23 According to this viewpoint, the property of being made of water is an object whose constituents are bodies of water. This object obviously isn't spatiotemporally cohesive, and it is thus a "scattered object."24 
This view is false, since it has the obviously false consequence that any two uninstantiated properties (e.g. the property of being an 8-ft tall person and the property of an 50-ft tall giraffe) are identical. 
There is another problem. Let S be the scattered object that ex hypothesi is identical with property P, this being the property of being made of water. One changes S by destroying or displacing any given body of water. But one does not, by that means or any other, do anything to affect what it is to be made of water; so one doesn't thereby affect the property of being made of water. Since, therefore, S and P don't have the same properties, they are not identical.

For example, some hold that a given property is identical with a spatiotemporal entity whose constituents are that property's instances. 23 According to this viewpoint, the property of being made of water is an object whose constituents are bodies of water. This object obviously isn't spatiotemporally cohesive, and it is thus a "scattered object."24 
This view is false, since it has the obviously false consequence that any two uninstantiated properties (e.g. the property of being an 8-ft tall person and the property of an 50-ft tall giraffe) are identical. 
There is another problem. Let S be the scattered object that ex hypothesi is identical with property P, this being the property of being made of water. One changes S by destroying or displacing any given body of water. But one does not, by that means or any other, do anything to affect what it is to be made of water; so one doesn't thereby affect the property of being made of water. Since, therefore, S and P don't have the same properties, they are not identical.

35. These points are clearly stated and cogently argued by Searle (1983, 1984, 
1992). 
But empiricists treat S's being true as a one-place relation, that is, as a property. 36 This being their view, empiricists cannot accommodate the obvious fact that S's meaning P is indisputably convention-based without saying that it is wholly a matter 
of convention. 
In this particular case, the empiricist's subjectivism (viz. his conventionalist/subjectivist conception of arithmetical truth) is a reflection of his inability to countenance the existence of non-spatiotemporal entities: since the empiricist denies that there are such entities, he must deny that entities of type (c) are 
O 
among the relata of instances of the relevant sorts of relations. That leaves him with no choice but to conventionalize, and thus subjectivize, arithmetical truth. (Conventionalization is culture-level subjectivization.) 
Empiricism often mistakenly treats relations as properties, and it often treats 3- place relations as 2-place relations. (The relation of loving is a property of of ordered pairs <x, y> such that x loves y, and is thus a 2-place relation. The relation of being in- between is a property of ordered triples <x, y, z> such that x is between y and z, and is thus a 3-place relation.) As a result, empiricists are forced to espouse radically implausible views concerning anything relating to affect or emotion. Colors, for the empiricist, are "purely" subjective, as are tastes and fragrances.37

But if our color-experiences are categorically hallucinatory, why are they so informative? I know that green meat is inedible, that gray-haired people are old, and that a person whose finger-tips are blue has poor circulation. 
Colors are mind-dependent, but they are not mental. They are relations, but they are not two-place relations. The color of the ocean is not a two-place relation between me and the ocean: if it were, there would be some one color that all of my color-accurate perceptions of the ocean represented it as having; and there is clearly is no such color. 
Colors are properties of three-place relations. The blue of the ocean is really a property of ordered triples whose members consist of:

stop caring about the welfare of your recently kidnapped child, your sphere of awareness would have shrunk in some important respect. But you also believe that your sphere of awareness would in no way be diminished if you were to stop having the headache you are currently having. That's why you have no reservations about taking a pill to get rid of a headache, but you would have reservations about taking a pill to rid yourself of your concern for your child. 
The empiricist puts your headache in the same category as your concern for your child's welfare. In his view, each is equally non-cognitive; each is just a "sentiment." 
But no one really believes this; and it embodies an understanding of what emotions are that, in addition to being extremely crude, is therapeutically and theoretically sterile. In any case, in Part II, we'll see that if empiricism is false, our intuitions about these matters are correct. And in Part I, we'll see that empiricism is indeed false. 
2.4 Empiricists have made many attempts to spatiotemporalize meaning. These attempts fail quite as badly as their attempts to spatiotemporalize properties. (This is a consequence of the fact that meanings are identical with sets of properties.) For example, Wittgenstein (1958) held that “meaning is use."40 For a given expression to have a given meaning is for it to be used in a certain way; it is not for it to be associated with some non-spatiotemporal object. In Chapter 5, we'll consider Wittgenstein's reasons for saying that meaning is use. But whatever Wittgenstein's

In any case, it's clear that if expression-tokens were nothing but bursts of noise (etc.), then there could be linguistic activity on planets on which there was no sentient life. Which is absurd and which, being a corollary of Wittgenstein's argumentative starting point, shows that it's absurd to identify meaning with use. 
3.0 Because of the previously mentioned tendency to identify "scientific" with "empirical" inquiry, attempts to scientize psychology have typically been attempts to empiricize it.42 In Part II, we will identify some of the ways that empiricism-based or empiricism-inspired methodologies have damaged psychology, and we will attempt

The present author's viewpoint is that Freud and Chomsky succeeded in scientizing certain sub-domains of psychology, but that Churchland has, at most, only partly scientized any such sub-domain. 
Churchland's system is the least empiricism-compliant of the three. This is ironic

Q A 
Some schools of thought in psychology are spectacular successes, and the research- programs constitutive of such schools yield accurate and deep insights with quite as much regularity as physics or any other paradigm-case of a science. But those same branches of psychology make assumptions that, although correct, are hard to justify and that seemingly cogent arguments seem to prove to be incoherent, for example: 
There is unconscious ideation. 
There is ideation that is not only unconscious, but 
subpersonal. 
People can rationalize; people can deceive themselves. 
People can repress knowledge that they wish they didn't have. 
People can be internally conflicted, and an internal conflict is a battle between conscious and unconscious conceits. 
Repressed emotions may be expressed as symptoms: as compulsions, obsessions, unduly rigid belief-systems, a proneness to sudden bouts of fatigue, displacements, 
etc.

Q A 
RI is fallacious, and we will demonstrate as much in Chapter 15. But there is nothing obviously wrong with RI. So far as one immediately knows RI to be fallacious, it is because he has ex parte knowledge to the effect that there is such a thing as repression; it isn't because RI has some obvious argumentative defect. It isn't because, for example, it involves the fallacy of composition (if every one of x's proper parts has phi, x itself has phi - so, like each of the atoms composing me, I must weigh less than a billionth of pound) or the quantifier-shift fallacy (if for any x, there is some y such that x bears R to y, then there is some x such that for any y, x bears R to y – so, since every finite number has a successor, some finite number must be bigger than every finite number). 
That said, RI is fallacious and the conclusion of it is false. But RI differs from other fallacious arguments in an important respect. One can establish the defectiveness of some putative mathematical proof without proving the negation of what it is meant to prove. But one must demonstrate the coherence of the concept of repression if one is to show that RI fails to demonstrate its incoherence. Thus, it is only on the basis of what lawyers call an "affirmative defense" that one can undermine RI. Ordinarily, a defense-attorney must establish only that the evidence fails to establish his client's guilt; he needn't establish his client's innocence. But if the defense is "not guilty by reason of insanity," he has to show that his client is innocent (in the sense that, when he committed the deed in question, he was too insane to know what he was doing or

Q A 
A psychopath is someone who doesn't have a conscience and never had one to begin with.45 A sociopath is someone who had a conscience but ceased to have one. To sociopathize is to dismantle or corrupt one's conscience. One cannot execute this task without rationalizing. Indeed, the implementation of a certain sort of rationalization is identical with, or largely constitutive of, sociopathogenesis. 
The sociopath was once a non-sociopath. He once had a conscience along with the multifarious characterological concomitants of thereof. The process of becoming a sociopath strips one of many of those concomitants, but leaves intact some of the formal, skeletal properties of one's personality. 
To speak colloquially, sociopaths are people who "sell out" and "die inside,” becoming empty husks that, being formally but not substantively like their former selves, are but caricatures of the latter. The pre-sociopath has a distinctively human character-architecture. He has values; he is internally conflicted; he can love others; he grasps the concept of non-instrumental goodness. The sociopath has none of these 
characteristics. 
One becomes a sociopath. One ceases to be a psychopath. Psychopathy is a kind of perpetual infantilism. There is more to it than that, as we'll see, but that's the essence 
of it.

consequence of the conventions assigning meaning to "prime" "number,” etc. So, given only that one knows of these conventions, one doesn't know what SN means: one must figure out what PN means.

51. Short for "sentence concerning numbers." 
In general, one must always figure out what is meant by a complex expression. This is because the meaning of such an expression cannot be directly determined by convention. If there were a convention to the effect that SN had P for its meaning, then SN would ipso facto be a simple symbol. Let SN* be an expression that, by our stipulation, has P for its meaning and is orthographically and acoustically just like SN. Even though, by hypothesis, SN* has the same meaning as SN, the former is semantically different from the latter. The decompositions of the two sentences are different. SN decomposes into a number of meaningful parts; SN* does not.

Q A 
to believe that, without being linguistically competent, a given creature could think discursively. Could such a creature have grasped the propositions and arguments embodied in Adam Smith's work The Wealth of Nations? 
Surely not. This is what intuition tells us, at any rate, and it is the view of the present author and also, I should think, of most people. Intuition also tells us that one's having the cognitive wherewithal to write a treatise is not, at least not merely, an effect of one's having a certain degree of linguistic competence; intuition tells us that the two forms of competence are constitutively, as opposed to causally, related, and, therefore, that the relevant linguistic competence is a veritable component of the relevant cognitive competence, and not merely a precursor of the latter. The relationship borne by Adam Smith's cognitive competence with respect to his linguistic competence is not comparable to the relationship between borne by a person's being tall and healthy as an adult with respect to his having a good diet as a child. It seems that, at least up to a point, Smith's cogitations needed linguistic vehicles. 
To make a stronger point, it seems to be a conceptual necessity, not an idiosyncrasy of human psychology, that Smith's cogitations needed linguistic vehicles of some kind. Some people can multiply large numbers in their heads; they don't need to use pencil and paper. Others, like myself, need to use pencil and paper.

Q A 
In Part II, a way of reconciling (1) and (2) is proposed. Our way of reconciling them is not empiricism-friendly, as it involves the (for reasons to be discussed) empiricismunfriendly assumption that there is subpersonal thought. Subpersonal thought is unconscious thought that underlies conscious, pre-conscious, and repressed ideation. The cognitive operations (if any there be) that mediate vision, language-comprehension, musical ability, etc. are subpersonal. You don't figure out how to convert disturbances of your sensory surfaces into visual images. Your mind figures it out - but not you, i.e. not your self.52 
In fact, it would make no sense to say that you figured this out. To do so, you would already need to be able to have sense-perceptions (or at least some way or other of acquiring information in real-time about the physical world), and you would also have to be able to perform extremely sophisticated post-perceptual operations. And to explain the latter, we'd have to posit sub-subpersonal cogitations. 
So it would be viciously regressive to say that you - your self – carried out cognitive operations underlying sense-perception. Such a position, as Searle (1992) points

: Q A 
56. This is probably subject to qualifications, relating to the distinct possibility that there is a conceptual dimension to perception. Perception is not mere sensation. Perceptions are articulated sensations, and the articulations correspond to conceptual knowledge or something comparable thereto. 
The kind of phenomenology that mediates perceptual awareness of instances of one expression-type differs from the kind that mediates awareness of a different- expression-type: different expressions, different kinds of phenomenology. For reasons to be stated, subpersonal, non-iconic ideation becomes hewed to sequences of expression-images in much the way that, as Descartes discovered, geometrical propositions can be hewed to arithmetical propositions. As a result, different kinds of subpersonal ideation are associated with different kinds of phenomenology. But the mode of association has a very important property: those subpersonal thoughts are so hewed to the relevant image-series that if (in our judgment) those thoughts are correct (or valid or otherwise congenial), the vicissitudes in those image-series tip us off to that fact. (I will henceforth omit the parenthetical qualifiers.) The same thing mutatis mutandis holds with respect to incorrect subpersonal thoughts. 
Just as pleasant affects alert us to the presence of certain structural features in works of music (or paintings or buildings), and unpleasant affects alert us to their absence, so congenial phenomenology alerts us to the presence of positive properties (e.g. truthfulness and validity) in expression-image series, and unpleasant affects do

mean "relating to those strata of the mind other than the subpersonal stratum.") And the nucleus of one's self- though not of one's mind, which is an organization within one's mind - is consciousness. (I have not yet substantiated this claim.) So after a fashion, Berkeley is right. We don't grasp universals, except by way of linguistic- symbols. But - and this is where Berkeley is wrong our minds can grasp universals non-linguistically; and they must do so if linguistic expressions are to mean anything 
to us. 
7.4.1 Berkeley conflated images with concepts, using the word "idea" to refer to both. So, after a fashion, he was right to say that we couldn't have "ideas" of universals: images are not concepts and it is through conception that we grasp universals. 
There are two reasons why Berkeley failed to distinguish images from concepts: (i) Since, according to empiricism, all knowledge is observation-based, and since observation consists solely of imagery, empiricism cannot in any obvious way countenance the existence of non-image-mediated thought; and empiricists must therefore identify concepts with images and thought-processes (sequences of concepts) with sequences of images. 
(ii) Concepts are not constituents of consciousness. So far as they are conscious, they are access-conscious, not consciousness-constitutive. Empiricism is not easily reconciled with the idea that there is mentation that isn't consciousnessconstitutive; for empiricism is inimical to the idea of any invisible structure.
