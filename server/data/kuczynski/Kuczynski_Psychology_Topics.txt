# Document 1: What is Borderline Personality Disorder?

1. People with BPD have two distinct, simultaneously operative psychological "operating systems"
2. One BPD operating system is appropriately adult and sane; the other is infantile in nature
3. One part of the BPD person's mind remained fixated at an early phase of life, usually very early childhood
4. The fixation occurred because of trauma, usually sexual molestation
5. People with BPD oscillate between their two psychological integrations
6. The oscillation between modalities makes BPD individuals appear to be lying or playing games when they are actually shifting between incongruent worldviews
7. People with BPD may be extremely intelligent and intellectually developed
8. During lucid moments, BPD individuals may be utterly sane and utterly decent
9. It is wrong to infer that BPD people are psychopaths
10. When the infantile side predominates, BPD individuals act in entitled, narcissistic ways similar to psychopaths
11. The psychopath is simply a phony who puts on a mask of sanity; the BPD person is genuinely two-sided
12. Neither side of the BPD personality is a mask; each side is genuine
13. The BPD person's preferred psychological defense is splitting, not repression
14. The BPD personality structure is itself the result of splitting
15. Repression involves having a single psychological architecture and shoving incompatible conceits into the unconscious
16. Splitting involves shifting between one's adult side and infantile side rather than repressing
17. The normal person's psyche keeps infantilism in the abyss of the unconscious
18. The BPD person's psyche keeps infantilisms in a concurrently operative sphere of mental activity
19. Splitting takes the place of repression in BPD
20. The BPD person often behaves psychopathically due to a pronounced streak of psychopathy
21. There is a difference between this streak of psychopathy and full-blown psychopathy
22. When the BPD person acts non-psychopathically, she is being true to one side of her personality
23. When the BPD person acts psychopathically, it is because she is regressing
24. When the psychopath acts psychopathically, the mask has fallen; it is not regression
25. When the psychopath acts non-psychopathically, he is just acting

# Document 2: What is a Formal Language?

1. A formal language L may be identified with an ordered triple (E, G, M) where E is primitive expressions, G is grammar/syntax, and M is a meaning-function/semantics
2. A primitive expression is one that cannot be decomposed into other expressions
3. A grammar is a set of rules that strings of primitive expressions must satisfy to be grammatical
4. An ungrammatical string is not an expression of any kind
5. If a language has non-negligible expressive capabilities, then its grammar is a recursion defined for its own outputs
6. All languages are recursively defined expression-classes
7. Not all recursively-defined expression-classes are languages; a language requires a meaning function
8. No language can be infinite but not recursively defined, because such expressions would be unintelligible
9. Any non-recursive but definable expression-class contains only finitely many symbols
10. A finite expression-class could not possibly constitute a language
11. Two expressions belong to the same language only if they can be combined into a meaningful expression or share at least one constituent
12. An expression has expressive power only to the extent that what it means doesn't always collapse into what its users believe it to mean
13. A meaning-function identifies truth-conditions of sentences indirectly through contextual definitions
14. "Meaning" is ambiguous between meaning-what (semantics) and meaning-how (semantic decomposition)
15. Sentences can have the same truth-conditions but different meanings due to different semantic decompositions
16. All languages are formal languages; a "formal language" is one that is formally described
17. A natural language is by definition one not known on the basis of explicitly stated rules
18. English has no less formal properties than the most formal of formal languages
19. Natural languages have too much structural integrity, not too little, making rules difficult to identify
20. The antinomies supposedly arising in natural language afflict only crude models, not natural languages themselves
21. "Formal language" is itself a vague and relative expression
22. A sentence's logical form is nothing other than its meaning
23. The extent to which inferences can be made about a sentence's logical form from its syntax is a function of what the examiner already knows
24. To say a discipline can be "formalized" means there is a recursive definition of the class of all truths belonging to it
25. A perfectly formal language (where syntax completely determines logical form) is a surd, like a square circle

# Document 3: Religion and the Limits of Modern Rationalism

1. Any answer about religion's legitimacy embodies one of three attitudes: uncritical acceptance, rejection, or critical and reflective acceptance
2. James, Otto, and Eliade hold that the essence of religious sentiment is that this world is not all there is
3. Self-identified agnostics and atheists who are psychologically healthy hold some variant of the view that an invisible order exists
4. When people genuinely lack this view, they succumb to various forms of psychological morbidity
5. It is not possible for a member of any contemporary society to have an attitude of uncritical acceptance of religion
6. Contemporary fundamentalists choose to be fundamentalists; their beliefs are reactions, not natural perception
7. There are two forms of religious rejectionism: authentic (rationalism-based) and inauthentic (social conformity)
8. Most contemporary atheists are simply following the herd, just as true-believers were a thousand years ago
9. The brain-centers mediating "militant" atheism are identical with those mediating religious fundamentalism
10. There can be both reductive and non-reductive truths about religion
11. According to James, the essence of religion is belief in an unseen order that gives the world meaning and moral structure
12. James argues that even if God doesn't exist, belief in God gives one God-like strength
13. James's position is that our motivations and values are hewed to the presumption of a God superintending a moral order
14. According to Otto, the numinous is a presence that cannot be known through rational inquiry
15. God conceived as a super-person or as utterly rational is not the numinous
16. The miraculous is not identical with or necessarily an expression of the numinous
17. The awe-inspiring and terrifying are what we perceive to be supernatural
18. The numinous is a psychological projection relating to passivity and having one's guard down
19. According to Eliade, primitive/religious man conceives of time as circular, not linear
20. The shift from cyclical to linear time was caused by the creation of the written word, not Abrahamic religion
21. Religion is not pre-rationalism or anti-rationalism but early-stage rationalism
22. When James, Otto, and Eliade refer to "religion," they are actually referring to precivilizational spiritualism
23. Contemporary fundamentalists' factual beliefs are nearly identical to their secular counterparts'
24. These authors' position is not that we should be more spiritual, but that we are already spiritual without recognizing it
25. We cannot become non-spiritual; we can only wrongly believe we are non-spiritual and adopt lifestyles that contravene our spiritual natures

# Document 4: Why Does Alcoholics Anonymous Work?

1. The vast majority of severe alcoholics who permanently quit have gone through Alcoholics Anonymous
2. There is no way to "work the program" without surrendering to a higher power
3. Most people who quit drinking with AA's help were self-identified agnostics and atheists prior to starting
4. AA is no less effective for non-believers than for believers
5. There is little evidence that anything other than AA works for severe alcoholism
6. The alcoholic's higher power is a projection of his superego/ego-ideal
7. The alcoholic is internally divided: one part wants to drink, the other wants to live
8. The alcoholic's will has been completely shattered
9. In surrendering to a higher power, the alcoholic is really surrendering to some part of himself
10. The alcoholic's recovery centers on becoming less egocentric
11. Will must be distinguished from mere desire: will represents values, desire represents urges
12. The alcoholic must project his superego because years of rationalizations have corrupted his introspective faculty
13. Recovering from alcoholism involves becoming internally unified
14. Alcoholism is a compulsion to be insane (to replace reality with fantasy)
15. The alcoholic's leap of faith is not really a leap of faith because he is surrendering to a part of himself
16. God in general may be externalized conscience
17. Religious sentiment cannot be understood in strictly medical terms
18. Those who completely lack religious sentiment tend to be internally divided
19. Acquiring religious sentiment involves a surrender of one's agency to some other power
20. Religious conversions are justified by their consequences
21. Faith involves finding one's very own divinity to have a relationship with
22. The benefits of religious sentiment are enduring and deep, unlike the benefits of unalloyed delusion
23. What the trench-atheist finds is not God but his own conscience
24. When optimism is "self-fulfilling," it is because it disposes people to actualize potential they already have
25. Religious beliefs involve bona fide leaps of faith, unlike garden-variety empirical beliefs

# Document 5: Attachment Theory and Mental Illness

1. A person's emotional attachments influence how he deals with problematic situations, and vice versa
2. People with healthy and secure attachments, particularly in early life, are psychologically healthier than those without
3. A psychologically healthy adult is someone whose parents loved him but did not spoil him
4. A mother's love leads to self-love; a father's discipline leads to self-discipline
5. A person's attachment behavioral system is largely determined by early-life relationships with caregivers
6. A child needs at least one stable attachment with a caregiver to become a healthy adult
7. There are four basic attachment patterns: Secure, Anxious-ambivalent, Anxious-avoidant, and Disorganized
8. Infants with secure attachments have nurturing and dependable caregivers
9. Infants with anxious-ambivalent attachments have emotionally withdrawn and unreliable caregivers
10. Infants with anxious-avoidant attachments have abusive caregivers
11. Infants with disorganized attachments have extremely abusive or highly unreliable caregivers
12. A child's attachment pattern tends to be identical with the one they had as an infant
13. Adults can have different attachment patterns from those they had earlier in life
14. Inadequate early-life attachments give rise not only to maladaptive personality traits but to full-blown psychopathology
15. Anxious-ambivalent early-life attachments are dispositive of neurosis
16. Anxious-avoidant early-life attachments are dispositive of psychosis
17. Disorganized early-life attachments are dispositive of psychopathy
18. Psychopaths do not form meaningful attachments and have no desire to do so
19. Most psychopaths were treated coldly or cruelly by key caregivers in early life
20. Psychopaths do not benefit from psychotherapy
21. Good adult relationships are consequences of solutions to problems caused by bad early-life relationships, not the solution itself
22. People with mental illnesses tend to form relationships that validate their symptoms rather than alleviate them
23. A secure patient-therapist relationship is necessary for the therapist to help the patient
24. A secure patient-therapist relationship does more for helping patients have healthy relationships than intellectual insight
25. Therapists are under a categorical obligation to help patients learn to be rational and autonomous

# Document 6: Chomsky's Two Contributions to Philosophy

1. Chomsky made two contributions to philosophy: the poverty of stimulus argument and the argument for sub-personal thought
2. If sensory data alone sufficed to explain language acquisition, furniture or animals exposed to the same data would also learn language
3. Innate cognitive structure enables humans to respond to sounds and light-patterns in ways that eventuate linguistic knowledge
4. Experience merely triggers pre-existing cognitive structure that was "waiting to be turned on"
5. The mind's innate structure enables acquisition of linguistic ability and all forms of cognitive competence
6. We have a priori knowledge of truths that enable us to organize experiences into cognitive competence
7. The knowledge Chomsky discusses is not knowledge the mind has; it is the mind itself
8. Knowledge that you have is structure-internal; framework-constitutive knowledge is the framework itself
9. Your cognitive framework is the subject; knowledge of facts is the object known to that subject
10. Mental contents one is aware of are occupants of one's cognitive architecture, not the architecture itself
11. When aware of oneself, one is aware of products of one's cognitive framework, not the framework proper
12. Framework-constitutive structures and operations are deeply unconscious, unlike Freudian unconscious contents
13. Language is productive: linguistic expressions can be combined into larger expressions
14. Language is systematic: parts of complex expressions can be rearranged to form other expressions
15. The systematicity and productivity of language reflect corresponding facts about cognitive structure
16. Language is productive and systematic because our minds are productive and systematic
17. We understand relations of logical dependence that map meanings of sentence-parts onto meanings of sentences
18. Cognitive abilities are mediated by physiology that encodes insight and intelligence
19. Pure physiology without intelligence would enable only stereotyped responses, not keeping pace with novelty
20. Where there is pure physiology, there can be training but not teaching
21. Where there is pure physiology, there can be operant conditioning but not genuine learning
22. Pre-experiential structural properties are cognitive, not physiological, in nature
23. Cognitive properties are realized or implemented by physiology as hardware implements software
24. The fact that we can learn and use language proves pre-experiential properties are cognitive, not merely physiological
25. Knowledge of language-constituting structures is structure-constituting, not structure-internal
