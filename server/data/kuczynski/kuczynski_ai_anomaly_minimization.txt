# Anomaly Minimization in Knowledge and AI: A Convergence



## Abstract

This paper examines a particular epistemological framework for understanding certain types of knowledge claims, especially those bearing on skeptical scenarios, and demonstrates its striking alignment with the architecture and functioning of modern artificial intelligence systems (LeCun et al., 2015). We argue that in many important cases, knowledge claims can be understood through the lens of anomaly minimization, where belief justification stems from the relative anomaly-generating potential of competing hypotheses. The paper shows how this epistemological framework finds confirmation in the fundamental mechanisms of AI systems, particularly in their training processes and belief formation architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017).



## Preamble

The question of how we know what we know has been central to philosophy since its inception. While traditional approaches often seek absolute foundations for knowledge (Descartes, 1641/1984) or attempt to defeat skepticism through purely logical means, this paper proposes a more naturalistic approach to understanding certain types of knowledge claims - one that finds unexpected support in the architecture of modern artificial intelligence systems (Brown et al., 2020).



## The Theory

When confronted with certain types of skeptical challenges - "How do you know you won't sprout wings?" or "How do you know the world doesn't disappear when you close your eyes?" - our knowledge claims often rest not on direct certainty but on a more subtle form of justification. In such cases, what we often mean by "I know X" is that we recognize that not-X would generate far more anomalies and discontinuities in our web of understanding than X (Quine, 1951). This is not meant as a universal account of knowledge - it doesn't apply to analytic truths or to all forms of empirical knowledge. Rather, it offers insight into how we justify beliefs in cases where direct verification is impossible but where alternative scenarios would create massive disruptions in our understanding of the world.



Consider the wings example: while we cannot prove with absolute certainty that we won't sprout wings in the next minute, we can recognize that such an occurrence would generate enormous anomalies in our understanding of biology, physics, and the conservation of mass and energy. The justification for our belief comes not from direct verification but from the relative anomaly-generating potential of the alternatives.



## AI Architecture and Epistemological Alignment

Modern AI systems, particularly neural networks and large language models, demonstrate remarkable architectural alignment with this epistemological framework. This alignment manifests in several key ways:



1. Loss Function Minimization: Neural networks learn by minimizing loss functions - effectively reducing prediction errors across their training data (Goodfellow et al., 2016). This process parallels the anomaly minimization principle, as the system adjusts its internal representations to create the least "surprise" or discontinuity in its predictions (He et al., 2022).



2. Next-Token Prediction: Large language models make predictions based not on certainty but on minimizing discontinuity with context (Radford et al., 2019). When predicting the next word in a sequence, the model selects tokens that create the least disruption to the established context - much like how our knowledge claims often rest on minimizing anomalies in our web of understanding (Chowdhery et al., 2022).



3. Embedding Space Organization: The way AI systems organize information in their embedding spaces follows this same principle (Mikolov et al., 2013). Concepts whose association would generate fewer anomalies are positioned closer together, creating a knowledge structure that mirrors our theory's emphasis on minimizing discontinuities (Devlin et al., 2019).



4. Attention Mechanisms: Modern transformers use attention mechanisms to weigh different parts of context in ways that minimize overall anomalies in their predictions (Vaswani et al., 2017), demonstrating how intelligent systems naturally implement anomaly minimization in their architecture (Brown et al., 2020).



This alignment between AI architecture and our epistemological framework suggests that the principle of anomaly minimization captures something fundamental about how intelligence - both artificial and natural - processes and validates information. The fact that successful AI systems implement this principle in their core architecture provides striking empirical support for its relevance to understanding certain types of knowledge claims.



This convergence of AI architecture and epistemological theory opens new avenues for understanding both human and artificial intelligence, suggesting that studying how AI systems learn and form beliefs might offer valuable insights into the nature of knowledge itself.
