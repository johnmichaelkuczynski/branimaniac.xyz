--- MAJOR VIEWS ---
1. VIEW: Noam Chomsky made two contributions to philosophy
   EVIDENCE: "Noam Chomsky's two contributions to philosophy are: 1. The so-called poverty of stimulus argument for the existence of pre- experiential knowledge, and 2. His argument for the existence of sub-personal thought."

2. VIEW: The poverty of stimulus argument supports the existence of pre-experiential knowledge
   EVIDENCE: "The so-called poverty of stimulus argument for the existence of pre- experiential knowledge"

3. VIEW: Chomsky argues for the existence of sub-personal thought
   EVIDENCE: "His argument for the existence of sub-personal thought."

4. VIEW: A rock, chair, or tree cannot learn a language even if exposed to the same stimuli as humans
   EVIDENCE: "If you bombarded a rock, or a chair, or a tree with those same sounds and patterns of light, would it learn a language? No."

5. VIEW: A dog, cat, or squirrel cannot understand language even if exposed to the same stimuli as humans
   EVIDENCE: "What about a dog, a cat, or a squirrel? If such a creature were placed in circumstances just like those that, in you, led to your having the ability to understand these very words, would that creature be able to understand these words? Of course not."

6. VIEW: Humans learn language due to their innate cognitive structure
   EVIDENCE: "Because of your innate cognitive structure, you---unlike a cat or a dog, not to mention a rock or a tree---respond to those sounds and light-patterns in the right way."

7. VIEW: Innate cognitive structure triggers language acquisition in humans
   EVIDENCE: "In you, but not in a cat or a dog or a tree, they trigger a constellation of responses that eventuate knowledge of a language."

8. VIEW: Without pre-existing cognitive structure, no amount of sensory stimulation would lead to language acquisition
   EVIDENCE: "If you did not ab initio all but know a language---if your cognitive structure were not already there, in a very developed state, just waiting for a little bit of experience to 'turn it on', so to speak---then no amount of sensory of stimulation would do the trick."

9. VIEW: The mind's innate structure enables acquisition of cognitive competence
   EVIDENCE: "It is your mind's innate structure that enables your mind to acquire linguistic ability and, by analogous reasoning, to acquire any of the various forms of cognitive competence of which it is now in possession."

10. VIEW: Humans have pre-experiential or a priori knowledge
   EVIDENCE: "And since this pre-experiential structure is cognitive in nature, it follows that you have pre-experiential---or, to use the philosophical term, a priori---knowledge of truths on the basis of which you are able to organize the various experiences that you have and to distill their contents into the various forms of cognitive competence that you have"

11. VIEW: People are not consciously aware of the cognitive operations described by Chomsky
   EVIDENCE: "'But I was not aware of these various cognitive operations of which you speak,' it will be said."

12. VIEW: Psychoanalysis does not make one conscious of the cognitive operations posited by Chomsky
   EVIDENCE: "And, what's more, it's not as though, if you were subjected to psycho- analysis, you would then be conscious of the various cognitive operations posited by Chomsky"

13. VIEW: The knowledge Chomsky discusses is not knowledge that the mind has, but is the mind itself
   EVIDENCE: "The knowledge that Chomsky is talking about is not knowledge that your mind has; that knowledge is your mind."

14. VIEW: Knowledge that one has presupposes an existing cognitive structure
   EVIDENCE: "Knowledge that you have is knowledge that presupposes an existing cognitive structure."

15. VIEW: A priori knowledge is the cognitive framework itself, not internal to it
   EVIDENCE: "The a priori knowledge that Chomsky is talking about is not internal to your cognitive framework: it is your cognitive framework."

16. VIEW: One is not aware of the cognitive framework because it is the basis of awareness
   EVIDENCE: "You are not aware of it, because it itself is your awareness."

17. VIEW: One can be aware of oneself, but this awareness is of the contents created by the cognitive architecture
   EVIDENCE: "Yes, you are aware of yourself---in the sense that you are aware of many of the feelings, thoughts, etc. created by your cognitive archicture."

18. VIEW: Mental contents like feelings are transient, but the cognitive framework remains constant
   EVIDENCE: "The feeling of sadness that you are now consciously experiencing will come and go. Yesterday, it didn't exist; now it does; tomorrow, once more, it won't. But you will be there all the same."

19. VIEW: The sort of ignorance of self discussed by Freud presupposes some other, more fundamental knowledge of self
   EVIDENCE: "sort of ignorance of self discussed by Freud presupposes some other, more fundamental knowledge of self"

20. VIEW: Beneath rationalizations there is self-knowledge
   EVIDENCE: "Beneath your rationalizations there is self-knowledge."

21. VIEW: Knowledge of sensations, perceptions, beliefs, deliberations, and so on is knowledge of the contents of one's cognitive framework
   EVIDENCE: "all of this is knowledge of the contents of your cognitve framework."

22. VIEW: The things known are to the mind itself what the occupants of a hotel are to the hotel
   EVIDENCE: "The things known are to your mind itself what the occupants of a hotel are to the hotel."

23. VIEW: The structure of the hotel imposes strict and rigidly defined limits on the way in which people in the hotel can move about and interact
   EVIDENCE: "The structure of the hotel imposes strict and rigidly defined limits on the way in which people in the hotel can move about and interact;"

24. VIEW: Our cognitive structure can be deduced from our thought-patterns
   EVIDENCE: "our cognitive structure can be deduced from our thought-patterns."

25. VIEW: Thoughts, perceptions, and feelings are not themselves the cognitive structure but are its productions
   EVIDENCE: "But those thoughts, perceptions, and feelings are not themselves that structure. They are its productions."

26. VIEW: When you are 'aware of yourself', the thing you are aware of is not your cognitive framework itself but some product of that framework
   EVIDENCE: "And when you are, as we say, 'aware of yourself', the thing you are aware of is not, strictly speaking, your self. It is not, that is to say-your cognitive framework itself. Rather, it is some product of that framework."

27. VIEW: The knowledge that is your cognitive framework is not the object of any instance of self-awareness
   EVIDENCE: "the knowledge that is your cognitive framework, rather than being a product of it---that is not the object of any instance of these misleadingly so-called cases of 'self'- awareness."

28. VIEW: The framework-constitutive structures and operations that mediate learning and cognitive competence are deeply unconscious
   EVIDENCE: "the framework-constitutive structures and operations that mediate your learning and, in due course your using, language, and that mediate other forms of cognitive competence---that is why those structures and operations are, to use Chomsky's term, deeply unconsicous,"

29. VIEW: The contents of the Freudian unconscious are unconscious, but not deeply so
   EVIDENCE: "unlike the contents of the Freudian unconscious, which are unconscious, but not deeply so."

30. VIEW: The structure involved in acquiring knowledge and cognitive competence is not strictly physiological in nature
   EVIDENCE: "Why not regard all of the structure involved in our acquiring knowledge and cognitive competence as being strictly physiological in nature?"

31. VIEW: Languages are both productive and systematic
   EVIDENCE: "Languages are therefoore both productive, meaning that linguistic epxressions can be combined into larger expressions, and systematic, meaning that the parts composing complex expressions can be re-arranged to form other complex expressions."

32. VIEW: The systematicity and productivity of language are reflections of corresponding facts about our cognitive structure
   EVIDENCE: "Given that we use and therefore understand language, it follows that the systematicity and productivity of language are reflections of corresponding facts about our cognitive structure."

33. VIEW: Language is productive and systematic because our minds are productive and systematic
   EVIDENCE: "Language is productive and systematic because our minds are productive and systematic."

34. VIEW: Cognitive abilities are mediated or implemented by physiology
   EVIDENCE: "Obviously these cognitive abilities are mediated or implemented by physiology---by 'wetware' of some kind or other."

35. VIEW: All knowledge is encoded in brain-structures
   EVIDENCE: "And obviously all knowledge, whether pre- or post-experiental, is encoded in brain-structures of some kind or other, the same being true of all aptitudes."

36. VIEW: Pure physiology would only enable stereotyped responses to situations
   EVIDENCE: "if we were dealing with pure physiology---as opposed to physiology that encoded insight and intelligence, that embodied an undersatnding of interrelations of logical dependence and of content- appropriateness---if that were the case, then experience, supposing we were even able to have it in the first place, would enable us only to respond to situations in a few stereotyped ways:"

37. VIEW: Where there is pure physiology, there can be training but not teaching
   EVIDENCE: "Where there is pure physiology, as opposed to physiology that mediates that intelligence, there can be training, but there cannot be teaching."

38. VIEW: The ability to use and learn language is proof that pre-experiential structural properties are cognitive in nature
   EVIDENCE: "The fact that we can use language in the ways in which we can use it--- and the very fact that we can learn it in the first place---is proof that these pre-experiential structural properties of ours are not physiological, but are rather cognitive in nature."
