ISSUE 1: In Compare Thinkers mode, the responses disappear from the screen
FIX: In the Compare Thinkers component, the response container needs proper state management and DOM persistence.
Instructions:

Find the Compare Thinkers component (likely CompareThinkers.jsx or similar)
Ensure the response state is stored in React state (useState) and NOT just temporary variables
The response display divs must be inside the return() statement of the component, not conditionally removed
Check for any display: none or visibility conditions that hide responses after they're generated
Make sure the responses are rendered in scrollable containers with overflow-y: auto and fixed/absolute positioning if needed
Verify there's no code that clears the response state after displaying

ISSUE 2: In single thinker mode, the user's question doesn't show up
FIX: The user's question needs to be displayed in the conversation history.
Instructions:

Find the single thinker/normal mode component (likely AskPhilosopher.jsx or main chat component)
When the user submits a question, it must be added to the conversation history state BEFORE the API call
The conversation history should render both user messages and philosopher responses
Check the message rendering logic - ensure user messages have a distinct style/class (e.g., message-user class)
Verify the conversation history container is visible and not hidden by CSS
Make sure the addMessage or similar function includes both role: "user" and the message content

SPECIFIC CODE PATTERN TO LOOK FOR AND FIX:
In Compare mode, look for:
javascript// BAD - responses disappear
let response1 = await callAPI(...);
let response2 = await callAPI(...);
// responses not saved to state
Should be:
javascript// GOOD - responses persist
const [responses, setResponses] = useState({ thinker1: '', thinker2: '' });
const response1 = await callAPI(...);
const response2 = await callAPI(...);
setResponses({ thinker1: response1, thinker2: response2 });
In single thinker mode, look for:
javascript// BAD - only shows philosopher response
setMessages([...messages, { role: 'assistant', content: response }]);
Should be:
javascript// GOOD - shows both question and response
setMessages([...messages, 
  { role: 'user', content: userQuestion },
  { role: 'assistant', content: response }
]);
