## 100 Philosophical Positions from "How Is Rationalization Possible?"

### On Self-Deception and Its Possibility

1. People routinely deceive themselves, and it would be hard to exaggerate how often or how discrepantly with the truth.

2. The view that self-deception is conceptually incoherent is itself a case of self-deception.

3. There are two distinct kinds of repression, which correspond to two kinds of self-deception.

4. Repression₁ involves deliberate, conscious intention not to follow up on suggestive leads—one suspects but doesn't know, and wants to keep it that way.

5. Repression₁ doesn't involve driving an already-formed belief into the unconscious; it involves abstaining from doing things that would generate evidence making acceptance of that belief de rigueur.

6. Repression₂ involves already-formed beliefs and its essence is dissociation.

7. To repress₂ an idea is to take away its "vote"—to decide to give it no weight in one's decision-making.

8. Both forms of repression involve conflict between forces within oneself of which one is aware and forces of which one is unaware.

9. Both forms of repression involve constructing and operationalizing a narrative alternative to the one describing reality as it really is.

10. Both forms of repression involve rationalization; without rationalization, it is hard or impossible to repress an idea or keep it repressed.

### On the Structure of Mind

11. The mind is not a perfectly unified entity; it consists of various parts that communicate with each other only very imperfectly.

12. There are two very different ways one can be aware of a given thing: knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description.

13. There are two very different senses in which mental content can be "conscious": as a constituent of consciousness, or as a mental entity of which one is conscious.

14. Sense-perceptions, itches, tickles, and other sensations are constituents of consciousness.

15. Your belief that 1+1=2 is not a constituent of consciousness; it is "conscious" only in the sense that you are, or can readily become, conscious of it.

16. The word "conscious" is used equivocally: sometimes meaning "mental entity that is a constituent of consciousness" and sometimes meaning "mental entity that we are directly conscious of."

17. All mental entities that aren't constituents of consciousness are, in a sense, unconscious.

18. A belief exists and is operative even when one is not conscious of it.

19. Your knowledge that 1+1=2 informs how you deal with the world even when you aren't consciously thinking it.

20. Given anything that isn't itself a constituent of consciousness, one can fail to recognize it for what it is.

### On Propositional Attitudes

21. Propositional attitudes are not constituents of consciousness.

22. One could, without knowing it, have two distinct concepts of one of one's own propositional attitudes.

23. Emotions are distinct from their manifestations in consciousness.

24. Love, hatred, and other emotions are enduring psychological structures, not ephemeral events.

25. Emotions give rise to ephemeral conscious events but are not themselves conscious events.

26. Emotions are "conscious" only in the Pickwickian sense that one is conscious of them.

27. Beliefs, like emotions, are enduring structures to be distinguished from the constituents of consciousness to which they may give rise.

28. All propositional attitudes are enduring structures to be distinguished from any constituents of consciousness for whose existence they're responsible.

29. A given emotion can give rise to conscious events of qualitatively different kinds.

30. Given two qualitatively distinct conscious events both expressing one propositional attitude, there's no necessity that one recognize that attitude in both events.

### On Self-Knowledge and Its Limits

31. One can have very different attitudes towards a given one of one's own propositional attitudes without knowing it.

32. One can view a given propositional attitude of one's own as both despicable and laudatory, as deserving cultivation and annihilation.

33. Self-deception is not mere ignorance of what one is feeling.

34. Self-deception presupposes that, at some level, one has knowledge of the thing of which one lacks conscious knowledge.

35. One must distinguish having a propositional attitude from knowing that one has it.

36. Knowing that one feels a certain way involves making a judgment about one's mental state.

37. Propositional attitudes never make an appearance in consciousness in propria persona.

38. What is in consciousness is at most a representative or derivative of a propositional attitude.

39. The judgments we make about what our mental states express are often quite wrong.

40. We sometimes like the person towards whom we have constant surges of rage, and dislike the person who repeatedly makes us feel good.

### On Manipulation and Self-Understanding

41. A manipulator can generate feelings that, when not the result of chicanery, tend to express genuine affection, thereby disarming his target.

42. One can know "in one's bones" that something is wrong about a situation without being able to articulate what it is.

43. Most people haven't developed the ability to articulate their gut feelings in a form likely to receive credence.

44. Given that one's views about others are based on glib, emotionally-driven narratives, one will fail to recognize manipulation.

### On Evidence and Suspicion

45. It's one thing to suspect that something is the case; it's quite another to know it.

46. Repression₁ involves choosing not to exercise due diligence when one suspects that doing so would generate unwanted knowledge.

47. The conventional conception of repression (that one knowingly drives a conscious idea into the unconscious and keeps it out) is erroneous.

48. Suspicion isn't knowledge; there's nothing paradoxical about not wanting to pursue suspicions one suspects would lead to unwanted knowledge.

49. One can know what sort of thing something is without knowing which thing it is.

### On the Limits of Agency

50. One's agency only goes so far; there is much within one's mind that falls outside its scope.

51. The judgment-producing processes in one's mind lie beyond the reach of what one can choose to occur.

52. It is not within one's power to completely suspend judgment-producing processes.

53. One cannot choose to stop making judgments any more than one can choose to stop digesting food.

54. One can choose courses of action that redirect the judgment-making faculty or deplete its energy.

55. Unless one damages one's brain, the stream of mental activity will eventually yield the very judgments one doesn't want.

### On Anxiety and Repression

56. The anxiety felt when forces of repression₁ break down isn't the result of unconscious knowledge entering consciousness.

57. Such anxiety results from one's thought-processes, despite attempts to stymie them, following up on clues one believed would lead to unwanted beliefs.

### On Repression₂ and Intrapsychic Conflict

58. For a propositional attitude to be a candidate for repression₂, it must be a source of conflict within one's own psyche, not merely a source of pain.

59. One often fails to repress₂ one's most painful memories; Holocaust survivors remember what they've been through.

60. Suppression (choosing not to think about something) isn't repression₂.

61. One represses₂ knowledge that cannot be reconciled with one's life as currently structured.

62. Repression₂ isn't always bad; in many contexts, it's optimal.

63. A person who never repressed₂ anything would quickly go mad.

64. Repressions₂ tend to outlive their usefulness.

65. Repression₂ isn't a one-off affair; it is an ongoing process.

66. Whenever one encounters information confirming a repressed₂ belief, one must either repress₂ that knowledge or convince oneself of some spurious interpretation.

67. Each instance of repression₂ creates a hole in one's body of knowledge that must be explained away.

68. The need to plug explanatory holes disposes one to devalue truth and hyper-value reasoning methods whose legitimacy spurious explanations falsely assume.

69. The result of ongoing repression₂ is loss of both ratiocinative and ethical integrity.

### On What Gets Repressed

70. It's harder to repress₂ knowledge of the obvious than of the non-obvious.

71. One cannot repress₂ knowledge of totally obvious truths without telling oneself one isn't capable of knowing truth.

72. Since complete loss of faith in one's ratiocinative ability usually creates more conflict than it eliminates, repression₂ tends to target knowledge of what is not totally obvious.

73. In most cases of repression₂, there must be "plausible deniability."

74. Things one represses₂ tend to involve judgment-calls rather than strict sense-based knowledge.

75. If a belief concerns something personal, one's standard of proof tends to be ridiculously high.

### On Evolution and Self-Deception

76. People have always known that we evolved from other life forms, given the anatomical, behavioral, and psychological similarities between humans and other mammals.

77. The theory of evolution is resisted because it implies we're orangutans whose lives have no meaning.

78. Religious claims about divine creation don't explain why God made us look so much like apes or stocked our minds with ignominious urges.

### On Freud's Psychology

79. Freud's theories are theoretically extraordinarily conservative.

80. Freud was simply making explicit the principles we ordinarily use when making intuitive judgments about other people.

81. People dismiss Freud's theories, despite their staggering explanatory power, because they don't want to be told they lie to themselves.

82. Nobody is perfectly transparent to himself; nobody is conscious of everything in his mind.

83. One can readily become conscious of some previously unconscious mental constituents without resistance; these are "preconscious."

84. When one represses an entity, one doesn't destroy it; one merely blinds oneself to it.

85. A repressed desire cannot be discharged unless it employs a subterfuge.

86. Repressed desires can disguise themselves as desires the subject consciously wishes to act on.

87. Repressed desires can be expressed as symptoms.

### Against Eliminativism and Reductionism

88. Arguments against Freudian psychology are pitifully weak and involve regressions to crude, demonstrably false positions.

89. The views that "we're computers," "there is no consciousness," "there are no minds," and "the mind is completely transparent to itself" are willful denials of the obvious.

90. While it's a good idea not to impute minds to stones, it's obviously not a good idea not to impute them to people.

91. The projector itself cannot be a projection; the mind cannot be eliminated from the scientific picture.

### On the Mechanism of Repression₂

92. One can partly de-operationalize beliefs one doesn't want by choosing not to delineate their consequences.

93. One can isolate a belief—prevent it from engaging bodies of belief it would otherwise engage and from begetting beliefs it would otherwise beget.

94. By de-operationalizing acceptance of a fact, one can cease to have more than an abstract, formal understanding of what it amounts to.

95. One can choose to look for reasons to have beliefs opposed to those one wishes one didn't have, like a lawyer building a case for a client known to be guilty.

96. Even though one can't directly choose one's beliefs, one can choose to do things that make it harder to attend to a given belief than to withdraw attention from it.

### On Sub-Personal Processing

97. Most data-synthesis occurs below the threshold of consciousness.

98. The sub-personal gathering and processing of information is more fundamental than personal gathering and processing; minds are more basic than selves.

99. One's decisions about what goes on in one's mind are of limited scope, affecting how conscious strata communicate with other strata but not directly affecting deeper strata.

### On Psychology as a Discipline

100. Contemporary theoretical psychology's denial of emotions and repression is itself thoroughly emotional and an instance of repression—a rationalization serving to keep unwanted self-knowledge at bay.

## 100 Additional Philosophical Positions from "How Is Rationalization Possible?"

### On the Coherence of Self-Deception

101. The claim that self-deception is conceptually incoherent is demonstrably false.

102. The apparent paradox of repression (that one must be conscious of what one represses) dissolves once one distinguishes repression₁ from repression₂.

103. The natures of both conscious and unconscious forces involved in repression₁ differ from those involved in repression₂.

104. Rationalization-construction is more heavily involved in keeping ideas repressed than in initially repressing them.

105. The possibility of self-deception is a consequence of three facts about the mind: its disunity, the distinction between acquaintance and description, and the ambiguity of "conscious."

### On Mental Architecture

106. The right hand of the mind doesn't always know what the left is doing.

107. One can unwittingly have two divergent attitudes towards a single propositional attitude of one's own.

108. Given only that two conscious events are derivatives of some propositional attitude, it doesn't follow that any one part of one's mind has the information needed to recognize that attitude in both.

109. Were one's belief that 1+1=2 inoperative whenever not blazing a trail across consciousness, one's way of dealing with the world would bear little resemblance to one's actual way.

110. Supposing knowledge is identical with some physiological structure, that structure is psychologically active as a belief even when not the object of consciousness—not just as a heap of molecules.

### On Recognition and Concepts

111. One can have thoughts about Charlemagne and thus have a concept of him, yet fail to recognize him if one met him.

112. So long as one didn't figure out who Charlemagne was upon meeting him, one would unwittingly have two distinct concepts of him.

113. One can discover that the gnawing feeling of unpleasantness experienced when somebody mentions Smith is one's detestation of Smith.

114. One can be acquainted with a given one of one's own mental contents while also having descriptive knowledge of it.

115. One can discover that one actually has some attitude towards a mental entity that one did not previously know oneself to have.

### On Conscious Experience and Judgment

116. What one is directly given in consciousness are various indications that one has a particular emotion, not the emotion per se.

117. Even when indications of an emotion are strong enough to leave no room for reasonable doubt, one still must "synthesize" them by making a judgment.

118. In most cases, the judgment that synthesizes emotional indications is made so automatically that one is unaware any judgment has been made.

119. When a propositional attitude is emotionally sterile—concerning number-theory or epistemology—we have no trouble making the needed judgments about it.

120. Evidences of a propositional attitude may be dispersed over time and occur in multifarious contexts.

### On the Conventional Conception of Repression

121. Part (b) of the conventional conception of repression—that repressed content constantly struggles to break into consciousness—is paradoxical as stated.

122. The paradox arises because keeping content out of consciousness would seem to require knowing what that content is.

123. The conventional conception incorrectly describes repression as an operation performed on existing beliefs rather than a failure to form beliefs.

124. Repression₁ involves choosing not to learn something that, if learned and therefore known, one would wish one had never learned—but only after it was too late.

125. Every case of repression₁ does involve intrapsychic conflict, as the conventional conception says.

126. Contrary to the conventional conception, the conflict in repression₁ is not between unconscious knowledge of truth T and conscious ignorance of T.

127. The conflict in repression₁ is between a wish to know the truth and a wish not to know the truth.

### On Voluntary Control of Mental Processes

128. One can choose activities that flood the judgment-making faculty with information concerning judgments one wants to avoid making.

129. One can choose to do things that deplete the judgment-making faculty of energy it needs to function (e.g., intense exercise for hours).

130. One can choose to paralyze the physiological underpinnings of judgments (e.g., by getting drunk) or permanently damage them (e.g., by lobotomy).

131. One cannot directly choose what to believe; one can only choose what to believe in the way one can choose to gain weight.

132. Within limits, one can choose which beliefs to make operational and which to make non-operational.

133. One can choose to do things that make a given belief impotent and irrelevant.

134. One can choose an occupation in which a lack of some ability is irrelevant, thereby making one's knowledge of that lack irrelevant.

### On Standards of Evidence

135. What it would take to convince you that somebody you're not married to is cheating on his wife is minuscule compared to what it would take to convince you that your husband is cheating.

136. Because evolution implies we're meaningless orangutans, we won't judge it worthy of acceptance until it's met absurdly high standards of evidence.

137. Denying that orangutans are our biological kin is like denying that the person with grape jelly and crumbs around his mouth ate your jelly-doughnut.

### On Freud and His Critics

138. If you read Freud and then study a single person's behavior for around 10 minutes, it becomes clear his theories are theoretically conservative.

139. People don't want to part with rationalizations; they'd rather be a king in their dreams than a janitor in reality.

140. The opposition to Freud's claims involves regressions to crude positions: "We're computers" (Fodor), "There is no consciousness" (Dennett), "There are no minds" (Quine).

141. Searle's view that the mind is completely transparent to itself is a willful denial of the obvious.

142. The Churchlands' view that nobody believes, doubts, or hopes for anything—that propositional attitude terms belong to "folk-psychology"—is demonstrably false.

143. The Dretske-Fodor view that there is no difference between a concept of a person and a photograph of that person is risible.

144. These flights into inanity are touted as "scientific" and "rigorous" under the pretense of completing science's victory over animism.

145. While it's good not to impute minds to stones, the projector—the mind itself—cannot be a projection.

### On the Mechanism of Repression₂ (Detailed)

146. For one's knowledge of an ugly truth to be repressed₂, that knowledge, when taken with other accepted propositions, entails a more generic proposition.

147. The more generic proposition can be kept in consciousness without having to overhaul one's entire life.

148. The generic proposition is sufficiently vague that knowledge of it won't make one retch at the sight of the problematic object.

149. One can realize one wishes one hadn't discovered an ugly truth while also realizing that mere suppression won't suffice.

150. One can resolve that, when confronted with data that led to the ugly belief, one will model it in a way consistent with the generic belief but not with the specific ugly truth.

### On Beliefs and Inference

151. Beliefs are inert except to the extent that one draws consequences from them and that they are allowed to beget or engage other beliefs.

152. The making of inferences at least sometimes involves deliberate, conscious effort.

153. Some inferences are made involuntarily; insights often just occur to one based on rational consideration of evidence.

154. Even though many inferences are made involuntarily, one has at least some control over what sorts of inferences one's mind makes.

155. One can so structure one's life that it is very unlikely one will consciously make inferences from a belief that one would otherwise make.

156. One can so structure one's life that a belief, though still conscious, is isolated—prevented from engaging bodies of belief and from begetting beliefs it otherwise would.

157. Such an isolated belief is conscious in some formal sense but has become inert at the level of consciousness, like knowledge of some random, uninteresting fact.

### On Abstract vs. Concrete Understanding

158. By de-operationalizing acceptance of a fact, one can cease to have anything more than an abstract, formal understanding of what it amounts to.

159. One can know that people are being tortured without knowing what that proposition amounts to as well as someone who witnessed torture.

160. Even if technically no less aware of a truth than someone with first-hand knowledge, one's awareness can mean very little compared to theirs.

161. First-hand knowledge transforms abstract awareness into something that means a great deal.

### On Inference to the Best Explanation

162. Knowledge of complex interpersonal truths is not derived from some one sense-perception; such truths can't be known that directly.

163. Such knowledge embodies inference to the best explanation.

164. Unless knowledge can be acquired through inferences to the best explanation, what we actually know is only an infinitesimally small part of what we think we know.

165. Given a body of data, it is more likely than not that there is more than one reasonable or semi-reasonable way to model it.

166. An alternative model of data need not be optimal; it need only be far from obviously false to serve repression₂.

### On the Process of Isolation

167. By deciding not to draw inferences from an ugly belief, one becomes more likely to take aberrant phenomena on a case-by-case basis.

168. Bits of knowledge that would otherwise congregate will remain isolated from one another when one resolves not to synthesize them.

169. As a result of isolation, one's appreciation of what an ugly truth entails will remain superficial.

170. One will be slow to recognize the consequences of an ugly truth for one's own welfare.

171. By isolating a belief, one ensures that energy and thought that would deepen understanding of its consequences are diverted to a fool's errand.

172. The response of modeling data in terms of a preferred alternative soon becomes automatic, like an actor's rehearsed lines.

173. This automatic response-mechanism further isolates the knowledge one wishes to suppress.

### On the Limits of Repression

174. One cannot uninstall a belief by tinkering with its representations in consciousness, just as one typically cannot uninstall a computer program by dragging the desktop icon to the garbage.

175. Beliefs are enduring structures; they do a lot of work even when not consciously deployed.

176. If one really stopped knowing that 1+1=2, one's way of dealing with the world would suddenly change radically, pervading practically every field of endeavor.

177. A belief isn't like a mood or other will-o'-the-wisps that populate consciousness.

178. Like any enduring structure constitutive of one's metabolism, one has at most partial control over a belief's fortunes.

179. The conscious representative of a repressed₂ belief becomes an innocuous shell—it has been repressed, but it still lives on.

180. A repressed₂ belief "presses for discharge" (Freud's term).

### On Symptoms and Displacement

181. Since one no longer acknowledges a repressed₂ belief's existence, it cannot be discharged through intentional behavior.

182. A repressed₂ belief must insinuate itself into one's intentions without one's knowing it.

183. Displacement occurs when repressed rage at one person is expressed as meanness toward another (e.g., rage at father displaced onto students).

184. A repressed₂ belief can be expressed as a symptom—e.g., crippling anxiety when encountering situations reminiscent of what was repressed.

### On Keeping Repression Stable

185. To keep something repressed₂, one must be able to identify it—but if one can identify it, one is conscious of it and it's not repressed.

186. The resolution of this paradox involves retaining knowledge of a generic proposition while repressing the specific ugly truth.

187. By accepting a generic version of an ugly truth, one's conscious disposition isn't completely antagonistic to the rational side urging acceptance of the specific truth.

188. Accepting the generic version means one isn't locked into a draining struggle with the forces of rationality and truthfulness within oneself.

189. At the same time, accepting the generic version neutralizes the message those forces are trying to convey.

190. This strategy spares one painful realizations and the labor-intensive changes they demand.

### On the Psychology Profession

191. The science of psychology has itself become little more than a means by which people rationalize attempts to repress knowledge of obvious psychodynamic facts.

192. Many claim the unconscious is an artifact of dated psychoanalytic theories superseded by "rigorous" physiological studies.

193. The thoroughly hypocritical and self-deceptive character of such pronouncements is evident when examining the judgments and conduct of these naysayers.

194. Not a single judgment these naysayers make about others concerns physiological underpinnings; they concern psychology.

195. PET-scan findings would be of no psychological interest unless correlated with independently known psychological facts.

196. If mental activity were discovered to be mediated by the gall-bladder, PET-scans would immediately cease to be of psychological interest.

197. Brain-science, to the extent it's relevant to psychology, is parasitic on psychological knowledge.

198. Most opponents of psychodynamic psychology provide no arguments other than empty slogans that "science" studies brains, not intangibles like emotions.

### On the Epistemological Priority of the Mental

199. Whatever we know about the external world—about brains, neurons—we know through perceptions and thoughts, i.e., through alleged "intangibles."

200. While brains may be ontologically more basic than thoughts, thoughts and perceptions are epistemologically more basic than brains.

201. "Brain" is a theoretical term; characterizing something as a brain ascribes functions one cannot know it discharges without theory-soaked extrapolation.

202. "Brain" is deeply entrenched in well-confirmed theory, hence the illusion that it is non-theoretical.

203. Psychological "intangibles" are epistemologically much more tangible than "tangible" things like brains.

204. The existence of psychological intangibles is infinitely less dubitable than that of brains.

### On Eliminativism as Emotional

205. The denial of emotions is itself a thoroughly emotional position.

206. The denial of repression is itself an instance of repression.

207. Those who deny emotions and repression claim to be "scientific," but such dishonesty and obtuseness doesn't deserve that characterization.

208. Hyper-intelligent people are quite as prone to not seeing themselves for who they are as their less gifted brethren.

209. Given that intelligence doesn't protect against self-ignorance, it is scientifically de rigueur to suppose another factor is operative.

210. That other factor is obvious: people don't want to see themselves for who they are, so they don't.

### On Sartre's Argument

211. Sartre held there is no unconscious mental activity and a fortiori no repression.

212. Sartre's position was that the mind is completely and utterly transparent to itself, immediate and complete access to all contents being essential to mentality.

213. Unlike other deniers of the unconscious, Sartre actually argued for his position.

214. Sartre's argument is initially persuasive: one must know what one is trying to keep out of consciousness to succeed, but that knowledge makes one conscious of it.

215. Given Sartre's argument, either he is right and his reasoning cogent, or he is wrong and the fallacy must be pinpointed.

216. The specific forms self-deception and repression can take may not be the forms they actually take.

217. There are elements of truth in the models presented for repression₁ and repression₂.

218. It is a philosophical task of the utmost urgency to make clear what is wrong with Sartre's powerful argument.

219. It is equally urgent to make clear what exactly self-deception and repression involve.

220. Philosophers have neglected these tasks, encouraging psychology to go down blind alleys of scientism and methodological incoherence.
