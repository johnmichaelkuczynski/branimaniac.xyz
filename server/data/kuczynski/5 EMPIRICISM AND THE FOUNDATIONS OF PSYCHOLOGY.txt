etc.) are interrelated are identical. Despite that fact, the microphysical structure of any component of either house is completely different from the corresponding structure of any component of the other house. However, these differences have no bearing on the dynamic interrelations on the bricks, planks, etc. which those 
microrealities constitute. 
Both houses fall. They both fall for the same reason. That reason has nothing to do with the microstructures of their parts. It has to do with the fact that some plank x in the one house was improperly affixed to some other plank y and that plank x* in the other house was, in the very same way, improperly affixed to plank y*, where x* and y* are x's and y's respective counterparts. 
The mechanical (Newtonian, macro-level) laws involved in both cases were the same. At the same time, in both cases, those laws were operative only because of facts about the relevant microconstituents, which, of course, obey a completely different set 
of laws. 
We thus have a choice. We can say: 
(a) The laws compelling the collapse of both houses differed. The reason: the one house was microstructurally different from the other; and, at the end of the day, 
<

everything supervenes on micro-reality. 
Or we can say: 
QA 
(b) In both cases, the same laws were involved; but those laws were implemented by different microphysical mechanisms. 
(b) is the right option. For, if we go with (a), we make it a mere accident or coincidence that both houses fell, even though it was clearly no accident. 
12.1 This brings us to the next fact. Most laws hold only probabilistically. Two situations that are indistinguishable from Newtonian perspective could have different outcomes: in the one case but not the other, there might have occurred some quantum event that happened to ramify outside the normal sphere of influence of such events. (It is possible, given quantum mechanics, and it is therefore consistent with Newton's laws, so far as the latter are consistent with quantum mechanics, that I could walk through a brick wall.) 
Given this, we could say: 
(c) Since, guarantee given that initial non-initial conditions conditions C, C be

shorthand brought about for some C. So unwieldy, far as such but Newtonian laws 
don't provide a 00% a thing C will could obtain, correctly we can't be really said, it say 
would that correct, microphysical statement. 
But if we went with (c), we'd make it impossible to produce precisely the sort of explanatory meaningful generalization discussed earlier in connection with the two houses. This means that we would make it impossible to produce otherwise easily identified and illuminating explanations. 
Here we have a choice. We can say either 
(#) The structural (non-microphysical) defects in the houses caused them to collapse' 
(##) Those defects did not cause those houses to collapse, since causes operate with 100% efficacy, and such defects don't always lead to outcomes such as those described. 
If we go with (#), we satisfy the explanatory desiderata described earlier. If we go with (##), we hold onto our a priori belief that, if E2 results from E1, then, given E1, E2 couldn't have failed to occur. This position, though not to be jettisoned lightly, is so inimical to explanation that it must, in fact, be jettisoned.

[ QA 
Newton's laws, even after recent development in physics are taken into account, hold almost 100% of the time. So let's consider some laws (or 'principles, if you consider my use of the word 'law' question-begging) that are very obviously probabilistic. 
Smoking causes cancer. This would seem to be a law of sorts. (At the very least, it's a principled regularity. And, as we're about to see, if we identify laws with perfect concomitances, as opposed to principled regularities, then principled regularities have all of the explanatory virtues that laws are supposed to have and therefore might as well be identified with laws.) But less than 30% of smokers get lung cancer. Nonetheless, if asked, "why did Jerry get lung cancer?," the right answer (we may reasonably assume) is "because he smoked a pack of cigarettes every day." So here we can say that 
or 
even though events relevantly like E1 are unlikely to bring about events relevantly like E2. 
Let us now suppose that Larry smokes as much as Jerry but doesn't get cancer. In that case, it's hard to see how E1's being 
the cause of E2 could be maintained. "What we must say, it is natural to believe, “is

that E1 did not by itself cause E2 - that there 
was some other factor."

Surely there was some other factor. (To facilitate discussion, let's suppose that other factor to be one that falls totally outside the reach of medicine; let's suppose that it was some quantum-event that over-ramified.)

Q A 
For the reasons just given, there is no doubt that epistemically speaking, i.e. speaking from the viewpoint of explanation, there is such a thing as probabilistic causation. But that's a very different thing from saying that, ontologically speaking, there is such a thing as probabilistic causation. The orthodoxy these days is that, ontologically, there is such a thing as probabilistic causation. 163 
12.3 In order to move on, I must make some foundational points. Scientific explanations justify events and must therefore show those events to comply with natural laws.164 
Justification is a relationship that holds between propositions, not between facts. Facts don't bear on anything. (That is, they don't bear on other things in a logical or confirmational sense. They obviously bear on them in a causal sense.) Propositions consist of concepts. Facts consist of objects and, therefore, of instances of first-order concepts. A (non-analytic) proposition is a conceptualization or, as we might also say, a propositionalization of a given fact. A given fact admits of indefinitely 
163. Incidentally, John von Neumann's proof that the introduction of hidden variables could not make quantum physics be deterministic was shown, by Bell (1957) and Bohm (1958), to establish that quantum physics could not be made epistemically

many propositionalizations. I walk across the room. The mass-energy displacements constitutive of that fact are necessary and sufficient for the truth of each of many different kinds of propositions – atomic, chemical, physiological, psychological. 
Two propositions, P1 and P2, P2, can hold in virtue of the very same fact, and yet be such that neither has the slightest explanatory bearing on the other. It may be that for each psychological truth that holds in virtue of my deliberately walking across the room there is a corresponding biochemical truth. But chemical reaction xyz occurred isn't in any obvious way explanatorily relevant to JMK felt it in his professional interest to stampede in a visibly angry fashion across the room. 
12.4 Scientific disciplines presumably aspire to identify truths. But their first objective must be to model data; for it is only through data that truths can be known. There must therefore be a way of evaluating the fitness of a model without knowing whether

To model propositions is to systematize them in such a way that their bearing relations on one another are identified and appropriately organized. Propositions about facts are exceedingly crude representations of those facts. Consider the proposition: 
165. They're truths of a non-conceptual, non-propositional kind. But that subtlety can and should be ignored here, since what matters is that data, unlike non- representations (e.g. rocks), are things to which the concept of accuracy (truthfulness) applies, and data are therefore relevantly proposition-like.

(*), though true, tells us nothing about the myriad atomic, chemical, and physiological events in virtue of which (*) is true. Propositions consist of tendentious conceptualizations of bodies of data: of inquiry-driven over-consideration of certain aspects of those data and under-consideration of other aspects of them. So it is inherent in what propositions are that they leave out facts. Those facts are often causally relevant. But they cannot always fit into the system propositions constitutive of a given discipline. The generalizations constitutive of disciplines are constructed of

Q A 
Behaviorism is false: surely nobody ever actually thought otherwise. But many scholars felt that they had no choice but to advocate behaviorism, their personal reservations about it notwithstanding, since they accepted each of the following propositions: 
(1) Mental states qua private entities are not fit objects for scientific research and therefore don't exist as far as science is concerned. 
167. I am not alone in rejecting this. Kripke (unpublished lecture), Ernest Nagel (1962), and Einstein (1956) himself all reject it. Einstein: “God doesn't roll the dice."

(3) DN is correct. 
(1) and (2) are closely related. So far as scholars accepted (2), it was because they

13.1 The behaviorist rightly says: 
: Q A 
(WB169) We shouldn't put too much stock uncorroborated testimony of the man wearing the tin-foil hat who claims to have seen flying saucers. That said, if other people make similar allegations, and they do so independently of that man, then perhaps the man was telling the truth and it might be worth it for scientists to investigate these allegations. 
But in saying that, absent any corroboration, the eccentric man's testimony deserves no credence, the behaviorist is conceding that this individual's reportage is indicative of mental activity and, consequently, that behaviorism is false. 
For the behaviorist, the supreme methodological maxim is: it exists if the public can know about it and not otherwise. But the raison dêtre for this maxim is that, lest we foolishly accept as truth what is in fact the product of delusion or insincerity; lest we let rogues and madmen lead us about by the nose with their fairy tales; we shouldn't 
169. Short for "what behaviorism says.” 
put too much stock in a single, uncorroborated allegation. So the publicity-criterion ("don't believe if it can't be publicized") is meant to be a bulwark against insanity and fraud and thus very much presupposes the existence of the mental.

13.2 Given their acceptance of the claim that: 
: Q A 
(SP170) to the extent that mental entities exist, they are identical with dispositions to engage in certain overt behaviors, 
behaviorists had no choice but to hold that: 
(LR171) For one to have a command of the English language is for one to have various behavioral dispositions, e.g. a disposition to say (produces the noises) "very well, thank you" upon hearing "how are you?" 
According to behaviorists, thought cannot mediate between stimulus and response. So these dispositions are purely reflexive, like a knee jerk. Obviously these reflexes are not mediated by inborn mechanisms: people aren't born being disposed to say "very well, thank you" upon hearing "how are you?" At the same time, if behaviorism is to be correct, nothing cognitive can be involved in the acquisition of those reflex- mechanisms. So the behaviorist must conclude, and always does, that it is through operant condition that one develops the set of reflex-mechanisms that, in the behaviorist's view, constitute one's grasp of a language. In other words, it is through a regimen of the very same kind that Pavlov used to get his dog to salivate upon hearing the sound of a bell. 
LR is untenable. There are many reasons for this. First, as Chomsky (1959) points out, one consequence of LR, coupled with the points below it, is that if a suitably 
< 
185/476 
> 
Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
Q A 
conditioned person hears "how are you doing?" one will reflexively bark out "very well, thank you." But this isn't so. To use Chomsky's rather more vivid example, when one sees a fire, one doesn't bark out "fire! fire! fire!", even though this is precisely what we must do if LR is right. 
And as Chomsky also points out, many of the expressions we use are ones that we've either never heard, or have heard only a few times, but understand instantly and produce without hesitation when necessary. This shows, first, that it isn't through operant conditioning that language is learned and, second, that our responses to linguistic stimuli embody the deployment of mechanisms of a cognitive nature that are not acquired through experience. Those mechanisms must be pre-experiential, since they cannot (without rendering LN viciously regressive) be learned. ("Pre- experiential" doesn't mean the same thing as "inborn," since the structures subserving a given cognitive function could obviously come into existence post-utero.) And those 
170. Short for "scientific psychology." 
171. Short for "language, reflex." 
mechanisms are cognitive, since they mediate behavior that can't be understood in terms of the specificities of one's perceptual experience and is clearly principle-driven. 
To illustrate the last point: The syntactic rule governing the word "since" is extremely intricate; but a child has to hear it used but once or twice to use it

185-186/476 
Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
Q A 
way to operantly condition a person to use that word correctly. 
14.0 There is another problem with behaviorism. How a person reacts to a given physical stimulus is a function, not just of the nature of that stimulus, but also of what is in that person's mind. If I have a $100,000 in Smith's house, whereas you have no money there and also hate Smith, I'll react one way to the sound "Smith's house is burning down" and you'll react differently. So attempts to reduce mental states to overt behaviors end up reducing them to overt behaviors plus mental states: thus, what was supposed to be reduced hasn't been. 
To remedy this problem, a doctrine known as "functionalism" was put forth. It was wrongly taken for granted that functionalism is not identical with behaviorism. Functionalism is the doctrine that, for any mental type M, and any entity x, it is solely in virtue of what x's causes and effects are that x falls into M, if it does so fall, or fails to fall into M, if it does so fail. 
If your intention is to get into law school, you're likely to do certain things: study for the LSAT, send off applications to various law schools, etc. And your intention is not likely to come out of nowhere: it probably resulted from a high degree of ambition, from your having certain aptitudes, a certain sense of right and wrong, and, importantly, your being raised in a culture in which, given those attributes, the law is a desirable profession.

Q A 
be an exhaustive list of sentences describing the causes and the effects of instances of S1. Any mental entity will have both physical and purely psychological causes and effects. So being hit on the heat is caused by something physical and leads to various physical things (overt retaliatory behaviors). So if S1 will contain terms referring to overt physical inputs and outputs as well, probably, terms referring other mental entities. For each one relevant types of causes and effects, produce a sentence saying that its instances are prone to bring about, or be caused by, instances of being hit on the heat. Consolidate all of the resulting sentences into one big passage Z. (Z doesn't have to be a conjunction. It just has to be a single discourse.) Z will say, for any given type of mental entity, what the causes and effects are of its instances. 
For reasons previously stated, Z will contain constant terms that refer to mental states, and it will also contain terms that refer to physical states. For sentence S that is a constituent of Z, replace each occurrence of a term referring to (a kind of) mental state with a variable, taking care to use the same variable for each such kind. The result will be an open sentence or, equivalently, a sentence-form i.e. it will be an expression that contains free variables but is otherwise just like a sentence (e.g. “x + 2 = 5"). Then bind the free variables appropriately. In other words, prefix that open sentence with a quantifier (e.g. "for all x," "for some y,"), thereby forming a closed or bona fide sentence. (Different quantifiers will have to be used in different cases.) The result will be a sentence S* that contains no terms referring to physical inputs and 
< 
187-188/476 
Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
: Q A 
outputs, but no terms referring to mental entities. The latter will have been replaced with variables. (So instead of "pain causes one to scream," we are left with "there is some x such that x causes one to scream.") Do the same thing mutatis mutandis for each sentence occurring in Z. Let Z* be the resulting sentence. Z* will completely describe the human psyche without using a single term that refers to anything mental; every term in Z will refer to physical inputs or outputs. In this way, it is widely held, Lewis has done (i) reduced the mental to the physiological while (ii) doing justice to the fact, to which behaviorism did not do justice, that how one behaves is often times a function of one's mental condition, and not just of one's physical situation. Z* is sometimes referred to as the "Ramsey-Lewis" sentence (“RL” for short). (Frank Ramsey invented the just-described device (eliminate occurrences of unwanted terms, replace with variables, bind with appropriate quantifiers) that Lewis used. Ramsey's purpose, however, was to reduce statements about theoretical entities to statements about observables.)

14.2 Question: What sort of circumstances that would prompt one to say: 
(GI175) "I suppose that's a good idea, but I'll have to think about it first." Answer: Circumstances in which the speaker has certain beliefs, doubts, preferences, etc. He wants to accept the invitation just tendered, but is worried about the consequences of doing so. He doesn't want to accept that invitation, but doesn't want to decline it in an overly-direct fashion. Etc. 
In general, those circumstances are ones in which the speaker has certain beliefs, doubts, desires, etc. (This is a tautology: no matter what they sound like, bursts of noise aren't speech if they don't have psychological causes.) 
There are obviously infinitely many possible reasons why one might utter those words. Thus, there is no finite list of stimuli that could lead one to utter GI. 
If each sentence in Z were of finite length, Lewis's proposal might work. Suppose that sadness had just (say) 567 causes, that an intention to run for Senate had just 123 causes, and so on. In that case, the lists of possible causes and effects of instances of a given type of mental state would be finite and could therefore just be listed. 
But those lists are not finite and must be identified intensionally, i.e. in terms of 
< 
189/476 
Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
: Q A 
some property peculiar to all the items on that list; and in these intensional definitions, the term being defined is defined in terms of mentalistic concepts. There is no type of mental entity whose instances are such that both their causes and their effects fail to include something mental. It may be that certain kinds of pain only have physical causes. But those kinds of pain have all kinds of mental effects. Similarly, it may be that certain mental states (e.g. an intention to punch) has only physical effects; but such states have all kinds of physical causes. 
So RL is a surd: there is no such sentence, because the recursive definitions needed to identify the relevant classes are loaded with the very terms, these being mentalistic terms, that it is RL's purpose to eliminate. 
14.3 There is another problem with RL. If RL is right, mental states do nothing. Let x be the physiological structure mediating an intention to become a lawyer.

: Q A 
What the practitioner of a discipline knows, he knows only through the data that it is his discipline's purpose to model. Objectively speaking, the facts modeled by psychology are the same as (a subset of) those modeled by physics. But epistemically speaking, the one set of facts doesn't even overlap with the other. At the same time, speaking both objectively and epistemically, the facts modeled by any one physical science coincide with (or are of the same basic kind as) those modeled by any other such science. 
So, in both the epistemic and the objective sense of the word "fact," the physiologist and the physicist are given the same facts to work with, even though they part ways when modeling those facts. But, in the epistemic sense of the word "fact," the facts that the psychologist has to work with don't even overlap with those that the physicist (or physiologist or chemist etc.) has to work with. And it's the epistemic sense of the word "fact" that's the operative one; for facts are science-relevant only to the extent that are knowable or bear on what we know. Unalterably “noumenal," datatranscendent facts do not fall within the scope of science. 
Epistemically speaking, physics and physiology model the same facts. So even though neither can be reduced to the other, the two can be reconciled. For both are theoretical superstructures that converge on some one set of facts. What the two disciplines are studying is the same. How they study it is different.

It's a datum for physics, not for psychology; for the latter, it's a significant truth that isn't a datum. This is because the relevance of Larry's behavior to psychology is contingent on its being driven by forces that are correctly described by truths 11...lm that are either known (or to be known) introspectively or that model introspectively known/knowable truths. If it turns out that Larry is a zombie or a robot, the fact that he's throwing furniture around (etc.) ipso facto ceases to be of any concern to psychology, showing that it is itself one of the data that psychology must model. It corresponds to a truth that psychology must model. But that truth is not that: (LF179) Larry is throwing furniture about (etc.) 
It is rather that: 
(LF*) Larry is throwing furniture around (etc.) and the causes of his behavior are correctly described by truths known directly or indirectly through introspection.

behaviorism, and we've already seen why the obvious spuriousness of that doctrine redounds to the discredit of empiricism. 
15.0 Let us distill the contents of the previous sections into a form that makes their methodological ramifications clear. 
It is a datum that there are psychological data. It may be that there are no models of that data that can be assimilated into the data-models yielded by physics. But it's the scientist's job to model the data that he's given. It is not his job to prejudge the significance of that data. A scientist's suspicion that there is no physics-friendly way to model psychological data is not a good reason to deny the existence of such data. Many have thought otherwise. But their position is true only relative to the a priori, and therefore non-empirical, assumption that physics is the only legitimate discipline. Ironically, this a priori belief is an embodiment of empiricism. To be sure, we do have knowledge of our own minds, and that knowledge is empirical. But it is not empirical in a way that validates empiricism: one has direct knowledge of the fact that one is imagining a transistor radio; but that knowledge, though direct, is theoretical. It

Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
: Q A 
Of course, it's unempirical to turn a blind eye to empirical data, and psychological data is about is as empirical as data can be. At the same time, Dennett and Churchland are, in a way, being true to empiricism in denying the existence of such data. To their credit, they deny that the things I'm describing as "data" are in fact data, and they thus do as good as a job as possible of compatibilizing empiricism with the distinctively empiricist view that minds don't exist. 
The problem is that all data is as theory-heavy as psychological data. I couldn't begin to describe what I'm seeing right now without assuming the truth of many a theory. (And this is for the non-trivial reasons given earlier, not for the trivial reason that some of the entities I'd be describing, e.g. my computer, are by-products of theoretical innovations.) A consequence is that, if Dennett and Churchland are right about psychological data, they are also right about perceptual data: the latter aren't really data, they must say, since they are theoretically committed. So Dennett and Churchland are guilty of a doubly-incoherent view: they accept empiricism while denying empirical psychological facts and while also implicitly denying empirical non- psychological facts. And this double-incoherence is the consequence of their views' being truer to empiricism than that of many other empiricists. Because they are empiricists, Dennett and Churchland cannot be coherent without being incoherent. 
16.0 Throughout this book, we've insisted that it is only by data-modeling that we

acquire theoretical knowledge. 
: Q A 
Ironically, this position is one that empiricists are more likely to advocate than rationalists. Rationalists tend to claim that, when properly done, science identifies truths. Empiricists tend to claim that, when properly done, science generates useful suppositions whose correspondence to the truth can never be authenticated. “There really are electrons," says the rationalist. "Maybe," responds the empiricist. “But all we're entitled to say is that the data is usefully organized by supposing that there are 
electrons." 
It's generally taken for granted that these two positions cannot be reconciled. But they can be reconciled. To see why, we must sensitize ourselves to a subtle distinction. Consider the following two sentences:

: Q A 
Ironically, this position is one that empiricists are more likely to advocate than rationalists. Rationalists tend to claim that, when properly done, science identifies truths. Empiricists tend to claim that, when properly done, science generates useful suppositions whose correspondence to the truth can never be authenticated. “There really are electrons," says the rationalist. "Maybe," responds the empiricist. “But all we're entitled to say is that the data is usefully organized by supposing that there are 
electrons." 
It's generally taken for granted that these two positions cannot be reconciled. But they can be reconciled. To see why, we must sensitize ourselves to a subtle distinction. Consider the following two sentences: 
(i) For any n you choose, it is possible that, by coincidence, Smith throws heads n 
times in a row

Q A 
The objects of study are truths. So the objects of study are not facts, but relations between data and facts. When you study a heart (qua heart, not qua lump of molecules), you are not studying an object, as strange as that may sound; you are studying a relation holding between an object (a heap of molecules) and various data. If the objects of investigation were things, as opposed to relations of the sort just described, the objects of a botanist's investigations would form a proper subset of the objects of a microphysicist's investigations. But there is nothing that is the object of both botanical and microphysical scrutiny. 
"But botanists do study the same things as microphysicists," it will be said. “The microphysicist studies the plant qua lump of molecules; the botanist studies the lump of molecules qua plant." 
These qua-qualifications indicate that we don't study objects simpliciter, but objects as understood or described in a certain way. But this is merely a circuitous way of saying that we study truths about objects, truths being identical, not with facts, but with relations borne by data thereto. 
Such relations are objective, and although they do not themselves fall within the scope of physics, one of the relata of any given instance of such a relation is something that does so fall. So to the extent that the objects of study involve mind- independent

operant conditioning that we learn. In this section, we'll use it to refer to the second doctrine. 
Behaviorism is empiricism. According to empiricism, it's only through sense- perception that one learns. This is tantamount to saying that ab initio the mind is a blank slate. (Indeed, "blank slate,” or “tabula rasa,” is the very term Locke (1690), the first great empiricist, used to describe the mind's initial condition.) This in turn is tantamount to saying that it is only through sense-perception that the mind learns. And this is nothing other than behaviorism. 
Not all knowledge is factual knowledge. There is also procedural knowledge (knowledge-how). Behaviorists must say that it is through operant conditioning that we acquire procedural knowledge. For they cannot say, as we'll now see, that it is through any one perception that one learns (for example) how to use the word "fire": and, it will be clear, what is true of one's ability to use that word is true of any any given instance of procedural knowledge. 
How do you learn what "fire" means? "Through sense-perception," says the behaviorist; "you see fire while hearing utterances of the word 'fire." 
Yes, but how do you know that "fire" isn't being used to refer to some accompaniment of the fire, e.g. the fire-place, the logs in the fire-place, or the photograph on the fire-place mantel. 
"Because," says the behaviorist, "you hear utterances of "fire" on different

what it makes sense to identify as the meaning of a given word-token. It can only be through repeated experiences of that word that we know what it means; it can only be through operant conditioning." 
The behaviorist assumes that a being devoid of cognitive structure can have sense- perceptions. That is not the case. The photon-induced disturbances that elicit perceptions from you would elicit nothing from a rock. There are no perceptions in 
the rock to elicit. 
"But nothing other than physiology mediates between those disturbances and the perceptions in which they eventuate. There is no reason to posit any intervening cognitive structures." 
In Chapter 7, we considered this position and put forth two arguments to the contrary. Given the points made in Section 15.0, we can put forth a new and better version of the second argument. 
Henceforth, mentally infill the obvious qualifications, e.g. "other things being equal,” "setting aside performance-inhibiting factors," and so on. 
Any given person will have only finitely many perceptions during his lifetime. But class of stimuli that would elicit accurate perceptions from him is infinitely large and infinitely varied. Thus, if K is the least inclusive class containing every type of stimulus whose instances would elicit accurate perceptions from a given person, K's membership is infinitely large and infinitely varied. A corollary is that, for any n, no

whose membership contains every instance of this tracking relationship, K#'s membership is infinitely large and also, more importantly, infinitely diverse. In other words, the number of types of psychological differences instantiated by the members by K#'s members is infinite. There is thus no strictly physiological characterization of K#'s membership. There isn't any mental type all of whose instances are necessarily of the same physiological type. There is no physiological characterization of any mental property or a fortiori of the psychological differences between instances of any psychological property and instances of any other. There is thus no strictly physiological characterization of the mechanisms that assign members of K✶ to members of K. Those mechanisms must be understood in psychological terms. Perception leads to knowledge. So the members of K* are knowledge-conducive. They wouldn't be knowledge-conducive unless their respective K-causes justified them. Though physiologically implemented, the mechanisms linking K-causes to their respective K*-effects are psychological in nature and thus operate by mediating ideation. That ideation embodies a sensitivity to relations of justification and is ipso facto ratiocinative. Being a precondition for sense-perception, the knowledge embodied in the just-mentioned mechanisms cannot itself be acquired through sense- perception and therefore cannot result from operant conditioning. Therefore behaviorism is false, and so is empiricism, since empiricism is behaviorism.

:: Q A 
18.0 According to Carl Hempel (1966), the question "can psychology be absorbed into physiology?" is strictly empirical. In Hempel's view, future empirical findings might warrant either an affirmative or a negative answer to that question. This belief of Hempel's is to be understood in terms of his conception of what it is to reduce one discipline to another. Given any disciplines D and D*, Hempel believed, to reduce D to D* is to demonstrate that any given D-concept is co-extensive with some D*-concept; in other words, it is to show that: 
(a) given any D-concept C, there is some D*-concept C* such that C is instantiated just in case C* is instantiated. 
Hempel rightly believed (a), assuming it true, to entail that: 
(b) Given any D-proposition P, there is some D*-proposition P* such that P* is true just in case P is true. 
Hempel rightly believed (b), assuming it true, to entail that: 
(c) If K is any class of events that it is D's responsibility to explain, there is some class K* of events that it is D*'s responsibility to explain such that K-events are perfectly correlated with K*-events. 
Finally, Hempel believed (c), assuming it true, to entail that: 
(d) D has been assimilated into D*, meaning either that, given D*, D's existence is 
superfluous - there is no reason for D to exist or that D, though not superfluous, is nothing but a branch of D*. 
<

Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
: Q A 
Contrary to what Hempel believes, (c) does not entail (d), and the reason for this is obvious. If there is anything true that D can say that D* cannot say, D cannot be absorbed into D*; if there is some D-truth that isn't logically equivalent with any D*truth, D is to that extent incapable of being reduced to D*. So if P is some D-truth to the effect that correlation x exists, and P* is some D*-truth to the effect that correlation y exists, D is incapable of being absorbed into D* unless P is a logical consequence either of P* or of some other D*-proposition. To the extent that P isn't such a consequence, there is something true about the world that D can say that D* cannot, it being of no relevance whether those two correlations can be correlated. Thus, Hempel was wrong to hold that D can be absorbed into D* if any given D- concept is co-extensive with some D*-concept. 
Science has but one objective: to produce an accurate and complete description of reality. If there is some truth T that a given discipline is incapable of recognizing, that discipline is to that extent incapable of being replaced by one that does recognize T. Each of the last two statements is a platitude - an empty truism, whose negation is therefore an absurdity - and, given how acute Hempel was, it must be asked why he countenanced an analysis of interdisciplinary reduction is so flagrantly inconsistent 
with such obvious truths. 
It is must therefore be asked why Hempel believed otherwise.

temperature is a function of the mean kinetic energy of the molecules composing it.) But when a three-year old discovers that fire is hot, he isn't discovering anything about micro-events; and when a chef says that the pan is too hot to touch, he isn't saying anything about molecules. So far as S has the form "...heat...," it concerns the property to which the chef is referring, and it doesn't concern (or appears not to concern) that property so far as it has the form "...molecular motion...." There are (so let us suppose) laws governing the generation, loss, and redistribution of instances of the aforementioned perceptible property. (That supposition is coherent. In fact, it's approximately true.) Let L be an arbitrary one of those laws, and let P be a proposition to the effect that L holds. It turned out (so let us suppose) out that L holds in virtue of some other law L*, such that L* concerns the behavior of molecules. (This supposition, like the previous one, is approximately correct.) Let P* be a proposition to the effect that L* holds. There is obviously some sense in which somebody affirming P isn't saying the same thing as somebody affirming P*. The first person is talking about macrophenomena; the second is talking about microphenomena. Relative to the suppositions we've made, thermodynamics (the study of the perceptible phenomenon referred to as "heat") is reducible to statistical mechanics (the study of the micro-phenomena constituting that perceptible phenomenon). In point of fact, thermodynamics can (to a non-trivial extent) be reduced to statistical 
mechanics.

(2) "Brump" is synonymous with "someone (it doesn't matter who) having the property of being the one and only person to have ever memorized everything Shakespeare ever wrote." 
Were it true, (1) would be a semantic rule, and the same is true of (2). Let us assume (2) is in fact a semantic rule, and let us also assume that "Brump" is unambiguous. In that case, 
(3) "Brump weighs over 200 lbs" 
has the same meaning as 
(4) "there exists exactly one person who has memorized everything Shakespeare ever wrote, and that person weighs over 200 lbs." 
In that case, therefore, one needn't have any idea as to the identity of the Shakespeare reader in question to know what (3) says about reality: to know what must be the case for (3) to be true, one needn't have any empirical knowledge, other than a knowledge of the semantic rules of the English language. 
But now let us suppose that (1) is a semantic rule. (We will continue to suppose that

"...Brump...," setting aside sentences of that form that he doesn't understand for some other reason. If P is the proposition meant by a sentence of that form, and a given person knows that P is that sentence's meaning, let us say that "MG-understands" that sentence and that he knows the “MG-meaning" of that sentence as well as, consequently, the "MG-meaning" of the word "heat." ("MG” is short for meaning- giving.") Obviously a person can MG-understand an expression that he RF- understands. 
An unambiguous expression has a single MG-meaning. But no expressions has a single RF-meaning. Given any object O, there are infinitely many properties that O uniquely has, and any expression E that refers to O has infinitely many possible RFmeanings. (In any case, supposing E to be an expression of language L, the number of E's RF-meanings is identical with the number of those of propositions that L can express.) But we will that a given unambiguous expression has but one RF-meaning. (This assumption is innocuous, since it is easily corrected for.) 
Let X be a person who RF-understands an expression E that he doesn't MG- understand, and suppose that it is by virtue of associating proposition P with E that X understands E. (In other words, suppose that P is E's RF-meaning.) And let Y be someone who MG-understands E; and suppose that it is by associating P* with E that Y understands E. (In other words, suppose that P* is E's MG-meaning and, therefore, its meaning in the strictest possible sense.) P is distinct from the proposition P* that a

the correct disambiguation of (8). 
: Q A 
"Heat" therefore refers to molecular motion. But there is more to say. (9) is not the semantic rule for "heat.” To know what "heat" refers to, one doesn't have to have S- 
similar sensations. Gloxo is a Martian. Gloxo's intellect is no less sharp than a person's, and his senses are no less acute. But Gloxo's sensations aren't always qualitatively identical with their human counterparts, even though they are no less knowledgeconducive. When Gloxo touches a hot object, he has a Q-similar sensations. Q-similar sensations are no less distinctive than S-similar sensations, but they are otherwise nothing like them. Gloxo knows that a given object is hot, and (so we may assume) that it is appropriately described as "hot" if he has Q-similar sensations when touching it. There is nothing about that word's meaning that we can know that Gloxo cannot. So even though the semantic rule for “hot” is encoded in the proposition meant by (9), that proposition is not identical with that rule. There is some condition O namely, that of being constituted by molecular activity of a certain kind - such that the semantic rule for "hot" is given by the proposition: 
(11) A given object is "hot" just in case its condition is O. 
(11) is a semantic rule. Not only does it express a definition; it expresses a semantic, as opposed to an analytic or a scientific definition. The sense in which it expresses a definition is the same as the sense in which, for some person O

even though we have no idea what it is that has the characteristics in question. It's 
often known that 
(16) There is some condition some disease - such that all and only people with such and such symptoms have that disease, 
even though we haven't the foggiest notion as to the nature of the condition underlying those symptoms - even though, in other words, we don't know from what bodily disfigurement people with those symptoms are suffering. But that doesn't prevent us from naming that disease. Two people suffering from the same disease may have different symptoms, and two people having the same symptoms may not have the same disease. The connection between a given disease and a given symptomatic expression of that disease is almost always circumstantial; but that connection, though usually circumstantial, is often sufficiently tight that we can identify the presence of that disease in a given person on the basis of that person's symptomology, even though we may have no knowledge at all as to the nature of that disease. Neither emphysema, schizophrenia, nor motor-neuron disease is individuated by the symptoms to which it is likely to give rise. (Given any symptom likely to be had by anyone suffering from any given one of these diseases, it is theoretically possible that someone not thus afflicted should have that symptom and that someone thus afflicted should not have that symptom.) But, owing to the tight, 
< 
206-207/476 
Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
Q A 
albeit circumstantial, associations between instances of any one of those maladies and the presence of certain symtomologies, there have been words that unambiguously referred to those maladies as long as there have been references to anything. So there have been words whose semantic rules assigned them objects as to whose identities everyone using any such word was ignorant. People have therefore uttered sentences of the form "...D...," where "D" is any term referring to such a disease, and have therefore affirmed propositions of the form ...D... as to whose identities those talking and those listening were ignorant. 
Similar points hold of the word "heat.” Only few savants know what “heat” means, in one sense of the word "means,” even though, in another sense of that word, every English-speaker knows what "heat" means; and only a few savants understand any sentence having the form "...heat...," in one sense of the word "understands,” even though, in another sense of that word, every English-speaker understands many a 
sentence of that form. 
Let us relate these points to the relationship between thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Supposing S to be a true sentence of thermodynamics, S's RFmeaning differs from its MG-meaning, and S's MG-meaning coincides with S*'s MG-meaning, where S* is some sentence of statistical mechanics. What S says about the world coincides with its MG-meaning. Thus, if P is the MG meaning of a given true sentence of thermodynamics, P is identical with, and therefore composed of, the

those views that we have been advocating. (What we will say about the relationship between physiology and microphysics holds of the relationship between any two distinct disciplines.) 
We'll begin by describing a hypothetical universe W that resembles ours in some important respect, but also differs from ours in some important respects. In W, everything that is round is also green and everything that is green is round: the class of round things is co-extensive with the class of green things. But this is just a coincidence. The natural laws operative in W don't require green things to be round; nor do they require round things to be green. In W, there are sapient beings that do not in any relevant respect differ from us; and some of those being speak English. Referring to some object O that is round, and therefore green, English-speaking W- resident Smith says:

and he then says:

Question: In W, does (a*) mean the same thing as (b*)? Answer: No. The reason: In W, (c*) is true. 
Second question: In our world, does (a*) mean the same thing as (b*)? Answer: No. The reason: In W, (c*) is true. More precisely: Given that (c*) is true in W, it follows that, in our world, (a*) doesn't mean the same thing as (b*). 
With these points in mind, consider the statement: 
(d) Any given physiological property is co-extensive with some microphysical property. 
(d) could be false. It is false; therefore, it could be false. What is actual is possible. (Suppose that what were actual were not possible. In that case, it would be impossible. But the impossible obviously isn't actual.) Given that, in actuality, (d) is false, it follows that, even if it were true, it would still be capable of being false; it wouldn't be in the same category as:

but not the other. Nonetheless, each of those truths is a logical consequence of the other. So even though they are distinct, and in a particularly robust way, they are not distinct in a way that is of any significance to empirical science. There is no conceivable empirical datum that could confirm the one but disconfirm the other. Given any two logically equivalent truths, no matter how non-obvious it is that they are logically equivalent, nothing could confirm the one but disconfirm the other; and if the a given datum D (dis) confirmed the one to a given degree, that datum would necessarily (dis) confirm the other to that same degree. So even though (g) and (h) are entirely distinct truths, the differences between those truths are irrelevant to empirical science and, as far as empirical science is concerned, those truths are therefore identical. 
Unlike the difference between (g) and (h), the difference between (f) and (f*) is empirically significant, and the second is therefore more robust than the first, robust though the first may be. Given any possible world W#, no matter what the laws of nature in it may be, (g) and (h) are non-interchangeable from the viewpoint of W#science: (g) and (h) are no less interchangeable in a world in which physiological concepts are perfectly aligned with (some subset of the set of) microphysical concepts than they are in a world, such as ours, in which they are not so aligned This has the consequence, as we'll now see, that, were those two concept-sets so aligned, that fact would make it extremely hard to discover facts about the structure of the universe that

There is a metabiological principle that we must accept, and the justification for which we must know, if we are to know what that supposition entails or why it entails it.

To sum up: Physiological properties are multiply realizable. More precisely, a given property phi is multiply realizable in so far as it is a physiological property; and so far as that property is not multiply realizable, the reason is that factors having no basis in phi's being a physiological property are preventing phi from being multiply realizable. This means that, given any physiological property phi and given any set of circumstances S, phi is multiply realizable in S to the extent that phi's being a physiological property is determinative of what, if anything, instantiates is. It follows that x is capable of instantiating phi only if x is a physiological entity, and it therefore

If Reason #1 is the operative one, then - by supposition, effectively – it is nothing but a coincidence that, in W#, each physiological property is co-extensive with some microphysical property. (In this context, it will be recalled, we are granting Hempel's assumption - false though we have shown it to be - that it is logically possible for any physiological property to be co-extensive with any microphysical property.) Supposing that Reason #1 is the operative one, physiological occurrences of type K that are currently implemented by microphysical occurrences of type K* might cease to be thus implemented; they might at any point come to be implemented by microphysical occurrences of type K# (where, of course, K# and K* are different properties). Thus, supposing Reason #1 to be the operative one, any existing alignment of the physiological and the microphysical is both fortuitous and fragile. So far as such an alignment is fragile, one isn't justified in correlating physiological with microphysical events, let alone in attempting to explain physiological events in terms of microphysical events, except in so far as one has knowledge of the logically and, moreover, nomically contingent fact that physiological events of type K are realized by microphysical events of type K*. Thus, if Reason #1 is the operative one, it isn't possible, and doesn't even appear possible, to reduce the physiological to the microphysical. 
Let us thus suppose Reason #2 to be the operative one. In other words, let us suppose that, in W#, given any physiological property K, there is some microphysical

than their real-world counterparts; and, given only what we've said about W#, it is possible that the the former laws are identical with the latter laws. (If the former are more deterministic than their real-world counterparts, or they aren't deterministic in the same way as their real-world counterparts, it isn't by virtue of anything that we've said about W#.) What's going on in W# is that factors of a non-physiological kind are diminishing the scope of the class of entities that fall within the scope of physiological 
law. 
In W#, therefore, the laws of physiology are no more capable of being characterized in microphysical terms than their real-world counterparts. This means that, in W#, physiological explanations are no more capable than real-world microphysical explanations of being understood in microphysical terms. 
As far as the W#-operative laws of physiology are concerned, it is nothing but an accident that there is but one way that microphysical phenomena can implement physiological phenomena. An analogous point holds with respect to the W#-operative laws of microphysics. It cannot possibly be in virtue of anything inherent in those laws that microphysical phenomena are so limited in respect of their ability to mediate physiological phenomena. There is no possible universe where the laws of microphysics so much as recognize the existence of physiological phenomena; wherefore, there is no possible universe where there is a microphysical law to the effect that, for some physiological property phi, there is some microphysical property

capable than one is in our world of making correct physiological predictions on the basis of microphysical knowledge, and that would foster the belief that physiology could be astrophysical But that belief would be an illusion. 
A pair of stories will clarify this last point. On the basis of microphysical data, W#- scientist S makes a correct physiological prediction. Knowing that his prediction came true, S believes that his reasons for making that prediction were the right ones. S is wrong. (The next scenario is similar to one described by Carnap (1966). Carnap was making a point similar to the one we're making, but not coincident with it.) In our world, scientist S* points a gun at Brown and pulls the trigger. A nanosecond later, Brown falls down. S* believes that Brown fell down because he had just been shot. S* is wrong. There were no bullets in S*'s gun, only blanks; and Brown is an actor who, for some acting-related reason, fell down, as though he'd just been shot, right after S* pulled the trigger. S*'s pulling the trigger did indeed cause Brown to fall down. (That is, it was a distal, partial cause of Brown's falling down.) But S* is completely wrong as to the nature of the causal mechanism linking his pulling the trigger with Brown's collapsing. In our world, situations like the one just described are the exception, not the rule. In W#, they are the rule, not the exception. W# is replete with concomitances that mimic principled relations, and W# is therefore replete with instances of pseudo- causal relations that (for the very reason that they are such relations) are easily mistaken for actual causal relations. In our world, there are many concomitances; but
