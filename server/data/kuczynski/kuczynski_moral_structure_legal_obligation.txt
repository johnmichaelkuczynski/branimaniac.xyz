What 
are 
laws, 
and 
do 
they 
necessarily 
have 
any 
basis 
in 
morality? 
The 
present 
work 
argues 
that 
laws 
are 
governmental 
assurances 
of 
protections 
of 
rights 
and 
that, 
consequently, 
the 
concepts 
of 
law 
and 
legal 
obligation 
must 
be 
understood 
in 
moral 
terms. 
There 
are, 
of 
course, 
many 
immoral 
laws. 
But 
once 
certain 
basic 
truths 
are 
taken 
into 
account 
– 
in 
particular, 
that 
moral 
principles 
have 
a 
“dimension 
of 
weight”, 
to 
use 
an 
expression 
of 
Ronald 
Dworkin’s, 
and 
also 
that 
principled 
relations 
are 
not 
always 
expressed 
by 
perfect 
statistical 
concomitances 
– 
the 
existence 
of 
iniquitous 
laws 
poses 
no 
significant 
threat 
to 
a 
moralistic 
analysis 
of 
law. 
Special 
attention 
is 
paid 
to 
the 
debate 
between 
Ronald 
Dworkin 
and 
H.L.A. 
Hart. 
Dworkin’s 
over-all 
position 
is 
argued 
to 
be 
correct, 
but 
issue 
is 
taken 
with 
his 
argument 
for 
that 
position. 
Hart’s 
analysis 
is 
found 
to 
be 
vitiated 
by 
an 
impoverished 
conception 
of 
morality 
and 
also 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
government. 


Our 
analysis 
of 
law 
enables 
us 
to 
answer 
three 
questions 
that, 
at 
this 
juncture 
of 
history, 
are 
of 
special 
importance: 
Are 
there 
international 
laws? 
If 
not, 
could 
such 
laws 
exist? 
And 
if 
they 
could 
exist, 
would 
their 
existence 
necessarily 
be 
desirable? 
The 
answers 
to 
these 
questions 
are, 
respectively: 
“no”, 
“yes”, 
and 
“no.” 


Our 
analysis 
of 
law 
enables 
us 
to 
hold 
onto 
the 
presumption 
that 
so-called 
legal 
interpretation 
is 
a 
principled 
endeavor, 
and 
that 
some 
legal 
interpretations 
are 
truer 
to 
existing 
laws 
than 
others. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
it 
accommodates 
the 
obvious 
fact 
that 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
a 
physicist 
interprets 
meter-readings, 
or 
in 
which 
a 
physician 
interprets 
a 
patient’s 
symptoms, 
is 
different 
from 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
judges 
interpret 
the 
law. 
So 
our 
analysis 
of 
law 
enables 
us 
to 
avoid 
the 
extreme 
views 
that 
have 
thus 
far 
dominated 



debates 
concerning 
the 
nature 
of 
legal 
interpretation. 
On 
the 
one 
hand, 
it 
becomes 
possible 
to 
avoid 
the 
cynical 
view 
(held 
by 
the 
so-called 
“legal 
realists”) 
that 
legal 
interpretation 
is 
mere 
legislation 
and 
that 
no 
legal 
interpretation 
is 
more 
correct 
than 
any 
other. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
becomes 
possible 
to 
avoid 
Blackstone’s 
view 
(rightly 
descried 
by 
Austin 
as 
a 
“childish 
fiction”) 
that 
judges 
merely 
discover, 
and 
do 
not 
create, 
the 
law. 


Chapter 
1: 
Summary 
of 
the 
present 
work 


If 
Smith 
and 
I 
were 
stranded 
on 
a 
desert 
island, 
and 
we 
thus 
both 
fell 
outside 
the 
scope 
of 
any 
legal 
system, 
I 
would 
have 
a 
moral, 
but 
not 
a 
legal, 
obligation 
to 
refrain 
from 
punching 
him. 
Therefore, 
my 
actual 
legal 
obligation 
not 
to 
punch 
fellow 
citizen 
Smith 
(in 
other 
words, 
the 
obligation 
that 
I 
have 
to 
refrain 
from 
punching 
him, 
given 
that 
he 
and 
I 
both 
fall 
within 
the 
jurisdiction 
of 
some 
one 
legal 
system) 
is 
distinct 
from 
my 
moral 
obligation 
not 
to 
do 
so. 
But 
– 
so 
I 
argue 
in 
the 
present 
work 
--my 
legal 
obligation 
not 
to 
punch 
Smith 
is 
a 
moral 
obligation: 
it 
is 
a 
moral 
obligation 
to 
comply 
with 
a 
system 
of 
rules 
on 
which 
people 
depend 
for 
protections 
of 
their 
most 
basic 
rights: 
a 
system 
which 
builds 
highways 
and 
hospitals, 
prevents 
people 
from 
killing 
and 
stealing 
from 
one 
another, 
and 
holds 
physicians 
and 
other 
professionals 
accountable 
to 
certain 
ethical 
standards. 


One 
may 
have 
a 
legal 
obligation 
to 
commit 
an 
immoral 
act. 
But, 
in 
such 
a 
case, 
one’s 
legal 
obligation 
is 
not 
morally 
hollow. 
One’s 
legal 
obligation 
to 
commit 
an 
immoral 
act 
is 
identical 
with 
one’s 
moral 
obligation 
to 
comply 
with 
a 
system 
of 
the 
kind 
just 
described. 
Discharging 
that 
obligation 
involves 
committing 
an 
immoral 
act, 
but 
that 
obligation 
is 
not 
itself 
morally 
negative 
or 
morally 
hollow. 



This 
last 
point 
demands 
elucidation. 
It 
is 
one 
thing 
to 
have 
an 
obligation 
to 
do 
X, 
and 
it 
is 
quite 
another 
to 
have 
an 
obligation 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
which 
involves 
doing 
X. 
A 
surgeon 
has 
an 
obligation 
to 
heal 
his 
patient. 
Fulfilling 
that 
obligation 
involves 
causing 
his 
patient 
to 
suffer. 
But 
a 
surgeon 
doesn’t 
have 
an 
obligation 
to 
cause 
his 
patient 
to 
suffer. 
(In 
fact, 
he 
has 
an 
obligation 
to 
minimize 
his 
patient’s 
suffering. 
A 
surgeon 
would 
be 
violating 
his 
professional 
obligations 
if 
he 
chose 
not 
to 
use 
anesthetic 
when 
there 
was 
no 
medical 
reason 
not 
do 
so.) 
Similarly, 
fulfilling 
one’s 
legal 
obligations 
may 
involve 
committing 
an 
immoral 
or 
morally 
neutral 
act. 
But 
it 
doesn’t 
follow 
that 
legal 
obligations 
are 
ever 
immoral 
or 
amoral. 
If 
I 
have 
a 
legal 
obligation 
to 
do 
X, 
that 
means 
that 
I 
have 
a 
moral 
obligation 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
which 
involves 
my 
doing 
X. 
It 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
I 
have 
a 
moral 
obligation 
to 
do 
X. 
That 
is 
why 
a 
legal 
obligation 
to 
commit 
an 
immoral 
act 
may 
be 
morally 
wholesome. 
Hence 
the 
following 
argument 
is 
invalid 
--“given 
that 
one 
has 
legal 
obligations 
to 
commit 
immoral 
acts, 
it 
follows 
that 
legal 
obligations 
are 
not 
moral 
obligations” 
--and 
once 
this 
is 
seen, 
one 
of 
the 
more 
obvious 
obstacles 
to 
accepting 
a 
moralistic 
analysis 
of 
law 
has 
been 
removed. 


Let 
us 
discuss 
a 
positive 
reason 
to 
accept 
such 
an 
analysis. 
A 
government 
is 
a 
success 
precisely 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
it 
serves 
the 
interests 
of 
those 
whom 
it 
governs. 
The 
same 
is 
therefore 
true 
of 
laws, 
given 
that 
laws 
are 
among 
the 
instruments 
of 
government. 
It 
follows 
that 
the 
concept 
of 
law 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
in 
moral 
terms, 
even 
though 
there 
are 
immoral 
laws. 


Governments 
often 
behave 
in 
an 
unspeakably 
evil 
manner 
towards 
their 
own 
constituents; 
and 
oftentimes 
this 
misconduct 
involves, 
or 
even 
coincides 
with, 
the 
issuing 
of 
laws. 
On 
this 
basis, 
many 
have 
concluded 
that 
the 
concept 
of 
law 
is 
not 
to 
be 
understood 
in 
moral 
terms. 
But 
this 
line 
of 
thought 
involves 
a 
failure 
to 
make 
three 
important 
distinctions: 



(i) 
The 
distinction 
between 
individual 
and 
institutional 
frames 
of 
evaluation; 
(ii) 
the 
distinction 
between 
functional 
and 
purely 
factual 
frames 
of 
evaluation; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
distinction 
between 
suspensions 
of 
protections 
of 
rights, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
positive 
violations 
of 
rights, 
on 
the 
other. 
The 
personal 
success 
of 
a 
head 
of 
government 
may 
not 
involve 
his 
serving 
the 
interests 
of 
his 
constituents, 
and 
it 
may 
even 
involve 
his 
thwarting 
those 
interests. 
But 
a 
head 
of 
government 
is 
a 
success 
as 
a 
head 
of 
government 
of 
state 
precisely 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
he 
serves 
the 
interests 
of 
his 
constituents. 
Given 
this, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
objective 
of 
government 
– 
of 
any 
government 
-is 
to 
protect 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
governed. 
Stalin 
failed 
as 
a 
head 
of 
government 
precisely 
because 
he 
did 
not 
serve 
the 
interests 
of 
his 
constituents. 
It 
follows 
that 
the 
objective 
of 
the 
Soviet 
government 
was 
to 
serve 
the 
interests 
of 
its 
constituents 
– 
even 
though 
that 
may 
not 
have 
been 
the 
objective 
of 
Stalin 
or 
of 
any 
of 
the 
other 
senior 
officials 
composing 
that 
government. 
If 
a 
dictator 
issues 
a 
law 
that 
harms 
his 
constituents, 
he 
fails 
as 
a 
law-maker, 
even 
though 
issuing 
that 
law 
may 
help 
him 
achieve 
personal 
success 
of 
some 
kind 
– 
even 
though, 
for 
example, 
it 
may 
help 
him 
hold 
onto 
power. 
In 
general, 
one 
fails 
as 
law-maker 
if 
one 
issues 
a 
law 
that 
hurts 
those 
who 
are 
subject 
to 
it. 
This 
shows 
that 
the 
purpose 
of 
a 
legal 
system 
per 
se 
is 
to 
serve 
the 
interests 
of 
those 
who 
are 
subject 
to 
it 
– 
even 
though 
that 
may 
not 
be 
the 
objective 
of 
all, 
or 
even 
any, 
of 
the 
individuals 
who 
created 
that 
legal 
system. 
Distinction 
(i) 
thus 
removes 
one 
of 
the 
major 
reasons 
to 
reject 
a 
moralistic 
analysis 
of 
law. 


Now 
let 
us 
discuss 
(ii). 
Even 
if 
everyone 
alive 
suddenly 
succumbed 
to 
liver-disease, 
and 
each 
person’s 
liver 
stopped 
removing 
toxins 
from 
his 
blood-stream, 
there 
would 
still 
be 
a 
significant 
sense 
in 
which 
livers 
were 
to 



be 
understood 
as 
removers 
of 
toxins. 
If 
one 
accepts 
a 
strictly 
fact-based 
frame 
of 
evaluation, 
one 
is 
blind 
to 
this 
obvious 
fact; 
and 
one 
is 
not 
blind 
to 
it 
if 
one 
accepts 
a 
frame 
of 
evaluation 
that 
allows 
for 
functional 
categories. 
An 
analogue 
of 
this 
line 
of 
thought 
holds 
of 
law 
and 
government. 
Even 
if 
every 
government 
were 
thoroughly 
corrupt 
and 
exploitative, 
there 
would 
still 
be 
a 
significant 
sense 
in 
which 
governments 
were 
to 
be 
understood 
as 
protectors 
of 
rights, 
and 
in 
which 
the 
laws 
issued 
by 
governments 
were 
to 
be 
understood 
as 
attempts 
to 
provide 
protections 
of 
rights. 
Like 
hearts 
and 
livers, 
governments 
and 
the 
laws 
they 
issue 
are 
to 
be 
understood 
in 
functional, 
and 
not 
strictly 
statistical-empirical, 
terms. 


The 
significance 
of 
distinction 
(iii) 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
following 
argument. 
If 
a 
certain 
legal 
system 
doesn’t 
prohibit 
anyone 
from 
violating 
Smith’s 
rights, 
then 
Smith 
falls 
outside 
the 
jurisdiction 
of 
that 
system. 
There 
is 
legal 
obligation 
only 
where 
there 
is 
moral 
protection, 
and 
the 
moral 
core 
of 
one’s 
legal 
obligations 
lies 
in 
this 
fact. 


But 
there 
is 
an 
obvious 
objection 
to 
this 
argument. 
People 
have 
legal 
obligations 
under 
governments 
that 
harm 
them. 
Given 
this, 
it 
seems 
straightforwardly 
false 
to 
say 
that 
legal 
obligations 
under 
a 
government 
categorically 
presuppose 
receipt 
of 
moral 
protections 
from 
that 
same 
government. 
Here 
is 
where 
distinction 
(iii) 
becomes 
relevant. 
Suppose 
that 
Officer 
Smith 
beats 
me 
without 
cause. 
Even 
while 
I 
am 
being 
beaten, 
the 
government 
continues 
to 
protect 
my 
rights: 
anyone 
caught 
attempting 
to 
burgle 
my 
house 
or 
kidnap 
my 
children 
will 
be 
arrested; 
and 
it 
may 
even 
be 
other 
police 
officers 
who, 
acting 
in 
the 
name 
of 
duty, 
stop 
Smith 
from 
further 
beating 
me. 
Thus, 
Smith’s 
misconduct 
is 
a 
case 
where 
a 
positive 
violation 
of 
my 
rights 
is 
superimposed 
on 
the 
continued 
existence 
of 
governmental 
protections 
of 
those 
same 
rights. 
The 
same 
thing 
is 
true 
of 
any 
case 
where 
one 
has 
legal 
obligations 
under 
a 
government 
that 
harms 
one. 
Thus, 
even 



though 
one 
may 
have 
legal 
obligations 
towards 
a 
government 
that 
harms 
one, 
it 
doesn’t 
follow 
that 
legal 
obligation 
doesn’t 
presuppose 
moral 
protection. 
So 
far 
as 
one 
thinks 
otherwise, 
one 
is 
failing 
to 
make 
distinction 
(iii). 


Like 
the 
present 
author, 
Ronald 
Dworkin 
argues 
that 
the 
concept 
of 
law 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
in 
moral 
terms. 
His 
argument 
is 
that 
judicial 
decisions 
are 
often 
made 
on 
moral, 
as 
opposed 
to 
narrowly 
statutory, 
grounds. 
This 
argument 
is 
less 
than 
probative. 
If 
the 
judge 
rules 
that 
the 
money 
is 
Smith’s, 
then 
the 
bank-manager 
is 
acting 
illegally 
if 
he 
refuses 
to 
give 
Smith 
the 
key 
to 
the 
safety-deposit 
box. 
If 
the 
judge 
rules 
that 
the 
money 
is 
not 
Smith’s, 
then 
the 
bank-manager 
is 
acting 
illegally 
if 
he 
does 
give 
Smith 
the 
key. 
The 
judge 
may 
or 
may 
not 
make 
his 
decision 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
moral 
principle. 
In 
either 
case, 
the 
law 
is 
what 
the 
judge 
says 
it 
is. 
This 
is 
the 
antithesis 
of 
the 
idea 
that 
there 
is 
any 
necessary 
relationship 
between 
law 
and 
morality, 
even 
though 
it 
is 
obviously 
compatible 
with 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
two 
may 
sometimes 
overlap. 


We’ve 
already 
seen 
why 
law 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
in 
terms 
of 
morality, 
notwithstanding 
that 
Dworkin’s 
argument 
for 
this 
conclusion 
is 
less 
than 
cogent. 
But 
if 
our 
criticism 
of 
Dworkin 
is 
correct, 
it 
seems 
to 
follow 
the 
legal 
interpretation 
(so-called) 
is 
mere 
legislation, 
and 
thus 
isn’t 
interpretation 
at 
all. 
But 
legal 
interpretation 
is 
not 
mere 
legislation, 
and 
this 
is 
perfectly 
compatible 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
law 
is 
what 
the 
judge 
says 
it 
is. 


A 
brief 
detour 
through 
the 
history 
of 
science 
may 
help 
to 
indicate 
the 
broader 
outlines 
of 
my 
argument 
for 
this. 
The 
layperson’s 
concept 
of 
temperature 
has 
no 
application 
outside 
of 
what 
are, 
from 
a 
physicist’s 
viewpoint, 
extremely 
narrow 
horizons. 
When 
physicists 
identified 
heat 
with 
molecular 
motion, 
they 
were 
not 
identifying 
the 
content 
of 
the 
layperson’s 
concept 
of 
temperature. 
Rather, 
they 
were 
replacing 
the 
lay-person’s 
concept 
with 
one 
that 
is 
consistent 
with 
it, 
within 
its 
narrow 
sphere 
of 
applicability, 



but 
is 
more 
precisely 
defined 
and 
also 
has 
a 
much 
wider 
sphere 
of 
application. 
Such 
principled 
extensions 
of 
existing 
concepts 
are 
referred 
to 
as 
“delineations” 
or 
“precisifications.” 
Any 
judicial 
ruling 
is 
ipso 
facto 
an 
extension, 
not 
an 
identification, 
of 
existing 
law. 
But 
judicial 
rulings 
are 
principled 
extensions 
of 
the 
law, 
i.e. 
they 
are 
delineations 
of 
it, 
and 
are 
not 
cases 
of 
law 
being 
created 
out 
of 
whole 
cloth. 
Just 
as 
some 
delineations 
of 
the 
concept 
of 
temperature 
(“a 
body’s 
temperature 
is 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
velocities 
of 
its 
constituent 
molecules 
divided 
by 
the 
number 
of 
those 
particles”) 
are 
truer 
to 
pre-theoretic 
data 
than 
others 
(“heat 
is 
dephlogistinated 
matter”), 
so 
some 
interpretations 
of 
law 
are 
truer 
to 
existing 
law 
than 
others. 


Blackstone 
said 
that 
judges 
identify, 
and 
do 
not 
create, 
law. 
Austin 
described 
Blackstone’s 
position 
as 
a 
“childish 
fiction.” 
Given 
the 
argument 
just 
outlined 
– 
and, 
in 
fact, 
independently 
of 
that 
argument 
--we 
must 
agree 
with 
Austin. 
But 
given 
that 
same 
argument, 
we 
must 
disagree 
with 
the 
nihilistic 
view, 
held 
by 
the 
so-called 
“legal 
realists”, 
that 
judicial 
interpretation 
is 
mere 
legislation, 
and 
isn’t 
answerable 
to 
objective 
standards. 


Chapter 
2 
Basic 
concepts 


Do 
laws 
necessarily 
have 
some 
kind 
of 
moral 
basis? 
Yes 
– 
or 
so 
the 
present 
work 
will 
argue. 
But 
from 
Augustine 
to 
the 
present, 
every 
attempt 
to 
identify 
a 
necessary 
connection 
between 
law 
and 
morality 
has 
been 
flawed, 
giving 
credibility 
to 
the 
position 
that 
there 
is 
no 
such 
connection. 


If 
we 
are 
to 
see 
the 
true 
nature 
of 
law 
and 
legal 
obligation, 
we 
must 
first 
note 
a 
fact 
about 
morality. 
Good 
and 
bad 
are 
not 
binary 
concepts. 
They 
have 
“a 
dimension 
of 
weight”, 
to 
use 
an 
expression 
of 
Ronald 
Dworkin’s. 
It 
would 



be 
better 
to 
steal 
penicillin 
from 
the 
pharmacy 
than 
it 
would 
be 
to 
let 
your 
child 
succumb 
to 
his 
life-threatening 
infection. 
So 
given 
only 
those 
two 
choices, 
the 
right 
thing 
to 
do 
is 
to 
steal. 
But 
it 
doesn’t 
follow 
that 
stealing 
from 
Walgreen’s 
is 
good 
in 
an 
absolute 
sense. 
It 
is 
not. 
Theft 
and 
deception 
are 
not 
good, 
even 
though 
under 
many 
circumstances 
they 
are 
less 
bad 
than 
the 
alternative. 


If 
we 
say 
that, 
under 
the 
circumstances 
just 
described, 
stealing 
from 
Walgreen’s 
is 
good 
in 
an 
absolute 
sense, 
rather 
than 
merely 
being 
less 
bad 
than 
the 
alternative, 
we 
are 
led 
to 
say 
that 
there 
is 
no 
moral 
value 
to 
obeying 
the 
law. 
The 
law 
comes 
to 
be 
morally 
hollow 
or, 
at 
best, 
to 
have 
a 
highly 
circumstantial 
connection 
with 
morality. 


But 
a 
binary 
conception 
of 
morality 
can 
have 
the 
exact 
opposite 
consequence. 
If 
we 
think 
in 
terms 
of 
absolute 
right 
and 
absolute 
wrong, 
we 
cannot 
say 
that 
a 
law 
is 
at 
all 
moral 
unless 
obedience 
to 
it 
is 
morally 
de 
rigueur. 
So 
if 
we 
concede 
(as 
we 
surely 
must) 
that 
stealing 
from 
Walgreen’s 
is 
not 
a 
wholly 
good 
thing, 
then 
we 
end 
up 
embracing 
the 
absurd 
and 
evil 
view 
that 
saving 
your 
child’s 
life 
is 
less 
important 
than 
your 
not 
committing 
some 
misdemeanor. 
Laws 
are 
falsely 
elevated 
to 
the 
status 
of 
moral 
verities. 


So 
if 
we 
think 
of 
morality 
in 
binary 
terms, 
then 
either 
laws 
end 
up 
being 
morally 
arbitrary 
or 
they 
become 
unsurpassable 
excellences 
to 
be 
obeyed 
at 
all 
costs. 
But 
if 
we 
think 
of 
morality 
in 
terms 
of 
weight, 
then 
we 
can 
see 
laws 
for 
what 
they 
are: 
things 
that 
have 
some 
basis 
in 
morality, 
but 
that 
must 
sometimes 
be 
disobeyed 
if 
some 
weightier 
moral 
imperative 
is 
to 
be 
upheld. 
The 
idea 
that 
laws 
can 
have 
no 
moral 
value 
derives 
from 
the 
tendency, 
just 
discussed, 
to 
think 
that 
whatever 
is 
comparatively 
good 
or 
bad 
is 
absolutely 
so. 


Another 
confusion 
concerning 
morality 
underlies 
a 
failure 
to 
see 
the 
moral 
basis 
of 
law. 
There 
is 
a 
difference 
between 
having 
moral 
value, 
on 
the 



one 
hand, 
and 
being 
deserving 
of 
moral 
credit 
or 
commendation, 
on 
the 
other. 
A 
rabbit 
doesn’t 
deserve 
moral 
credit. 
It 
is 
not 
in 
the 
same 
category 
as 
somebody 
who 
works 
for 
the 
Red 
Cross 
or 
Doctor’s 
Without 
Borders. 
Being 
an 
amoral 
creature, 
a 
rabbit 
is 
ineligible 
for 
any 
kind 
of 
moral 
commendation. 
But 
a 
rabbit’s 
life 
has 
moral 
value. 
That 
is 
why 
it 
would 
be 
wrong 
to 
torture 
or 
needlessly 
kill 
a 
rabbit. 
Thus, 
what 
is 
good 
does 
not 
always 
deserve 
commendation. 
To 
have 
moral 
value 
and 
to 
be 
commendable 
are 
not 
the 
same 
thing. 


In 
fact, 
something 
that 
has 
moral 
value 
may 
not 
only 
be 
unworthy 
of 
commendation, 
but 
may 
even 
deserve 
condemnation. 
A 
bit 
of 
fiction 
will 
remove 
the 
appearance 
of 
paradox 
from 
this 
last 
point, 
and 
will 
thus 
help 
unveil 
the 
moral 
underpinnings 
of 
law. 
Smith 
is 
a 
talented 
pianist. 
He 
is 
at 
a 
phase 
of 
his 
pianistic 
development 
where 
it 
is 
especially 
important 
that 
he 
practice. 
The 
only 
piano 
to 
which 
Smith 
has 
access 
is 
in 
his 
tiny 
apartment, 
which 
he 
shares 
with 
several 
other 
people. 
Given 
his 
work-schedule, 
the 
only 
time 
Smith 
can 
practice 
is 
late 
at 
night. 
There 
is 
thus 
no 
way 
that 
Smith 
can 
practice 
without 
preventing 
his 
roommates 
from 
sleeping. 
Moreover, 
each 
of 
his 
roommates 
has 
a 
peculiar 
medical 
condition 
whereby 
the 
sound 
of 
piano-
playing 
causes 
permanent 
physical 
and 
psychological 
damage. 
For 
various 
reasons, 
it 
is 
not 
an 
option 
for 
Smith 
to 
find 
other 
roommates. 


Smith 
doesn’t 
want 
to 
harm 
anyone. 
But 
like 
everyone 
else, 
he 
wants 
to 
flourish 
as 
a 
human 
being. 
In 
his 
case, 
this 
involves 
playing 
the 
piano. 
So 
Smith 
does 
practice 
late 
at 
night. 
In 
doing 
so, 
he 
experiences 
ecstasies 
and 
sharpenings 
of 
awareness 
that 
fulfill 
his 
inner 
nature 
as 
nothing 
else 
could. 


In 
practicing, 
Smith 
is 
flourishing. 
Human 
flourishing 
is 
surely 
a 
good 
thing[1], 
and 
the 
same 
is 
therefore 
true 
of 
Smith’s 
practicing. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
as 
Smith 
well 
knows, 
his 
practicing 
is 
ruining 
the 
lives 
of 
his 
roommates. 
So 
in 
practicing, 
Smith 
is 
doing 
something 
condemnable. 
Thus 



Smith’s 
practicing 
has 
moral 
value 
and 
is 
condemnable. 


Suppose 
that 
some 
law 
were 
enacted 
that 
permitted 
Smith 
to 
practice 
under 
these 
circumstances. 
That 
law 
would 
protect 
a 
moral 
good 
– 
Smith’s 
flourishing 
– 
while 
also 
protecting 
behavior 
that 
is 
positively 
condemnable. 


The 
moral 
basis 
of 
law 
is 
easily 
overlooked 
if 
we 
identify 
the 
good 
with 
the 
commendable 
and 
the 
bad 
with 
the 
condemnable. 
There 
are 
laws 
that 
protect 
moral 
goods 
and, 
in 
the 
same 
stroke, 
practically 
guarantee 
the 
occurrence 
of 
the 
most 
despicable 
and 
condemnable 
behaviors. 
There 
are 
laws 
that, 
while 
not 
licensing 
positively 
evil 
conduct, 
fail 
to 
encourage 
or 
protect 
commendable 
action. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
these 
facts, 
many 
have 
inferred 
that 
laws 
can 
protect 
things 
that 
have 
no 
moral 
value 
and, 
consequently, 
that 
laws 
can 
have 
no 
connection 
to 
morality. 
But 
such 
an 
inference 
embodies 
two 
muddles. 
First, 
it 
fails 
to 
distinguish 
the 
concept 
of 
having 
moral 
value 
from 
the 
concept 
of 
being 
deserving 
of 
moral 
credit. 
Second, 
it 
assumes 
that 
anything 
having 
moral 
value 
cannot 
be 
condemnable. 


The 
failure 
to 
make 
these 
distinctions 
is 
yet 
another 
expression 
of 
the 
binary 
moral 
thinking 
discussed 
earlier. 
If 
we 
think 
in 
terms 
of 
absolute 
right 
and 
wrong, 
then 
Smith’s 
practicing 
is 
either 
totally 
lacking 
in 
moral 
value 
or 
it 
becomes 
an 
unimpeachable 
excellence; 
and 
any 
law 
that 
allows 
Smith 
to 
practice 
is 
either 
completely 
divorced 
from 
morality 
or 
it 
becomes 
a 
moral 
verity 
unto 
itself. 
Both 
of 
those 
of 
views 
clash 
with 
our 
moral 
intuitions. 
But 
if 
we 
think 
in 
terms 
of 
weight, 
we 
can 
see 
such 
a 
law 
for 
what 
it 
is: 
something 
that 
is 
probably 
wrong 
and 
should 
be 
abolished, 
but 
that 
also 
protects 
a 
moral 
good 
(Smith’s 
flourishing). 


There 
is, 
I 
believe 
another 
confusion 
– 
one 
that 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
morality 
per 
se 
– 
that, 
in 
my 
judgment, 
has 
retarded 
efforts 
to 
see 
the 
moral 
basis 
of 
law. 
Outside 
of 
micro-physics[2], 
principled 
relations 
are 
not 
typically 
expressed 
by 
strict 
and 
invariable 
concomitances. 
There 
might 
be 



F’s 
that 
are 
not 
G’s. 
It 
could 
even 
be 
that 
there 
is 
only 
one 
F 
that 
is 
a 
G, 
and 
a 
billion 
F’s 
that 
are 
not. 
But 
that 
by 
itself 
doesn’t 
mean 
that 
there 
isn’t 
a 
principled 
relationship 
between 
a 
thing’s 
being 
an 
F 
and 
its 
being 
a 
G. 


There 
are 
two 
reasons 
for 
this. 
First, 
principled 
relations 
are 
often 
given 
by 
ceteris 
paribus 
propositions 
– 
propositions 
of 
the 
form 
all 
other 
things 
being 
equal…If, 
all 
other 
things 
being 
equal, 
F’s 
are 
G’s, 
then 
there 
is 
a 
principled 
relationship 
between 
a 
thing’s 
being 
an 
F 
and 
its 
being 
a 
G, 
even 
though 
in 
circumstances 
where 
all 
other 
things 
are 
not 
equal, 
an 
F 
may 
not 
be 
a 
G.[3] 
So 
given 
only 
that 
there 
are 
morally 
empty 
laws, 
it 
doesn’t 
follow 
that 
there 
isn’t 
a 
principled 
relationship 
between 
a 
thing’s 
being 
a 
law 
and 
its 
protecting 
a 
moral 
good. 
Given 
only 
that 
a 
match 
may 
not 
ignite 
after 
being 
struck, 
it 
doesn’t 
follow 
that 
there 
isn’t 
a 
principled 
relationship 
between 
a 
thing’s 
having 
the 
property 
of 
being 
a 
struck 
match 
and 
its 
having 
the 
property 
of 
being 
on 
fire.[4] 


There 
is 
another 
reason 
– 
one 
that, 
I 
think, 
has 
a 
more 
direct 
bearing 
on 
the 
concept 
of 
law 
--why 
principled 
relationships 
don’t 
always 
correspond 
to 
perfect 
statistical 
regularities. 
A 
brief 
detour 
may 
help. 
Many 
planes 
are 
defective 
and 
therefore 
don’t 
fly. 
But 
there 
is 
certainly 
a 
principled 
relation 
between 
a 
thing’s 
being 
a 
plane 
and 
its 
being 
something 
that 
flies. 
When 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
concepts 
having 
a 
teleological 
or 
functional 
component, 
principled 
relationships 
can 
fail 
rather 
dramatically 
to 
correspond 
to 
perfect 
statistical 
correlations. 
Because 
something 
is 
a 
plane 
in 
virtue 
of, 
at 
least 
in 
part, 
what 
it 
is 
supposed 
to 
do, 
and 
not 
merely 
in 
virtue 
of 
what 
it 
actually 
does 
– 
because, 
in 
other 
words, 
the 
concept 
plane 
is 
not 
a 
strictly 
descriptive 
category, 
and 
has 
a 
functional 
component 
--there 
are 
cases 
where 
planes 
don’t 
fly, 
even 
though 
there 
is 
an 
important 
relationship 
between 
the 
property 
of 
being 
a 
plane 
and 
the 
property 
of 
being 
something 
that 
flies. 


The 
concept 
of 
law, 
I 
believe, 
has 
a 
teleological 
component. 
If 
this 
is 



right, 
then 
something 
is 
a 
law 
in 
virtue 
of, 
at 
least 
in 
part, 
what 
it 
is 
supposed 
to 
do 
and 
not 
merely 
in 
virtue 
of 
what 
it 
actually 
does. 
I 
will 
argue 
that, 
in 
fact, 
there 
is 
a 
significant 
sense 
in 
which 
laws 
are 
supposed 
to 
protect 
moral 
goods. 
An 
assassin 
who 
kills 
only 
the 
wicked 
is 
not, 
on 
that 
account, 
better 
as 
an 
assassin 
than 
one 
who 
kills 
the 
good. 
But 
a 
law 
that 
does 
good 
is, 
on 
that 
account, 
better 
as 
a 
law 
than 
one 
that 
fails 
to 
do 
so. 
It 
thus 
seems 
that 
it 
is 
the 
purpose 
of 
laws 
to 
do 
good 
(notwithstanding 
that 
this 
is 
often 
not 
the 
objective 
of 
the 
person, 
or 
persons, 
who 
make 
the 
law). 
Once 
this 
is 
granted, 
it 
is 
not 
hard 
to 
show 
that 
there 
is 
a 
moral 
basis 
to 
law, 
even 
though 
there 
are 
laws 
that 
fail 
to 
do 
any 
good 
and 
even 
though 
there 
are 
laws 
that 
are 
created 
by 
people 
who 
have 
no 
intention 
of 
doing 
good.[5] 


Granting 
this, 
I 
will 
argue 
that, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
conceptual 
necessity, 
a 
legal 
system 
as 
a 
whole 
is 
not 
only 
supposed 
to 
do 
good, 
but 
must 
succeed 
in 
doing 
so. 
There 
are 
legal 
systems 
(e.g. 
that 
of 
Stalin) 
that 
seem 
to 
do 
nothing 
but 
harm. 
But 
such 
a 
view, 
I 
will 
argue, 
involves 
our 
comparing 
such 
legal 
systems 
not 
to 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
legal 
system, 
but 
rather 
to 
better 
legal 
systems 


(e.g. 
that 
of 
the 
present-day 
Swedish 
government). 
When 
we 
wish 
to 
assess 
whether 
legal 
systems 
are 
categorically 
good 
things, 
our 
benchmark 
must 
be 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
legal 
system, 
and 
not 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
superb 
legal 
system. 
It 
might 
be 
appropriate 
to 
give 
an 
illustration 
of 
the 
principle 
at 
work 
here. 
Even 
a 
bad 
doctor 
can 
do 
much 
good 
– 
he 
knows 
how 
to 
set 
a 
broken 
leg, 
to 
perform 
CPR, 
and 
so 
on. 
It 
is 
only 
compared 
to 
a 
good 
doctor 
that 
he 
can 
be 
regarded 
as 
doing 
harm. 
(When 
a 
doctor 
“does 
harm”, 
it 
is 
almost 
always 
by 
failing 
to 
do 
good 
– 
by 
failing 
to 
do 
what 
a 
good 
doctor 
would 
have 
done 
in 
the 
same 
circumstances.[6]) 
When 
we 
wish 
to 
assess 
whether 
doctors 
are, 
as 
a 
rule, 
good 
things, 
we 
must 
compare 
the 
presence 
of 
doctors 
with 
the 
absence 
of 
doctors; 
we 
mustn’t 
compare 
bad 
doctors 
with 
good 
doctors. 
Similarly, 
when 
we 
wish 
to 
assess 
whether 
legal 
systems 
are 



categorically 
good 
things, 
our 
benchmark 
must 
be 
the 
absence 
of 
law 
altogether, 
and 
not 
the 
presence 
of 
some 
superlative 
system 
of 
law. 
We 
will 
find 
that, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
analytic 
necessity, 
even 
the 
worst 
legal 
systems 
do 
a 
fair 
amount 
of 
good 
in 
absolute 
terms. 
(They 
also 
do 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
evil. 
But 
when 
we 
take 
into 
account 
the 
non-binary 
nature 
of 
morality 
– 
the 
fact 
that 
goods 
and 
bads 
outweigh, 
but 
do 
not 
cancel, 
one 
another 
– 
that 
fact 
is 
perfectly 
consistent 
with 
the 
fact 
that, 
in 
absolute 
terms, 
legal 
systems 
always 
do 
a 
non-trivial 
amount 
of 
good.) 


I 
will 
also 
argue 
that, 
leaving 
aside 
those 
laws 
that 
result 
from 
patent 
deviations 
of 
the 
normal 
law-making 
mechanisms, 
any 
actual 
law 
does 
in 
fact 
protect 
some 
moral 
good, 
even 
though, 
in 
many 
cases, 
that 
good 
is 
dwarfed 
by 
some 
evil 
with 
which 
the 
law 
in 
question 
is 
incompatible. 


Ronald 
Dworkin 
is 
one 
of 
the 
great 
exponents 
of 
the 
view 
that 
law 
and 
morality 
have 
some 
kind 
of 
non-trivial 
relationship 
to 
each 
other. 
The 
first 
part 
of 
the 
present 
work 
is 
spent 
showing 
why 
Dworkin’s 
defense 
of 
this 
position 
is 
unsatisfactory. 
The 
rest 
is 
an 
attempt 
to 
show 
that, 
even 
though 
Dworkin’s 
arguments 
are 
less 
than 
probative, 
the 
position 
he 
is 
defending 
is 
a 
reasonable 
one. 
We 
will 
find 
that, 
even 
though 
Dworkin’s 
arguments 
are 
not 
always 
decisive, 
some 
of 
the 
points 
involved 
in 
those 
arguments 
are 
indispensable 
to 
a 
proper 
understanding 
of 
the 
deep 
but 
delicate 
relationship 
between 
the 
concepts 
of 
law 
and 
morality. 
In 
particular, 
we 
will 
find 
that 
Dworkin’s 
discussion 
of 
the 
difference 
between 
rules 
and 
principles 
gives 
us 
the 
key 
to 
seeing 
the 
moral 
structure 
of 
legal 
obligation. 


Chapter 
3 
Can 
there 
be 
morally 
empty 
laws 
and 
legal 
systems? 


It 
is 
an 
empirical 
fact 
that 
there 
are 
immoral 
laws 
and 
legal 
systems. 



But 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
the 
relationship 
between 
law 
and 
morality 
is 
entirely 
a 
matter 
of 
happenstance. 
There 
would 
be 
sheer 
anarchy, 
and 
hence 
a 
de 
facto 
absence 
of 
law, 
in 
any 
society 
permitting 
unrestricted 
murder, 
theft, 
and 
arson.[7] 
So 
any 
legal 
system 
worthy 
of 
the 
name 
must 
forbid 
such 
iniquities 
and 
must 
to 
that 
extent 
coincide 
with 
the 
dictates 
of 
morality. 


Further, 
even 
though 
many 
laws 
are 
unjust, 
there 
is 
a 
sense 
in 
which 
they 
are 
always 
supposed 
to 
be 
just.[8] 
A 
military 
campaign 
that 
kills 
only 
the 
wicked 
is 
not, 
on 
that 
account, 
more 
successful 
as 
a 
military 
campaign 
than 
one 
that 
kills 
the 
innocent. 
By 
contrast, 
a 
legal 
system 
that 
promotes 
the 
ends 
of 
justice 
is, 
on 
that 
very 
account, 
more 
successful 
as 
a 
legal 
system 
than 
one 
that 
fails 
to 
promote 
those 
ends. 
So 
there 
would 
seem 
to 
be 
a 
sense 
in 
which 
any 
legal 
system 
necessarily 
aspires 
to 
be 
just, 
even 
though 
many 
fall 
sadly 
short. 


Nonetheless, 
some 
hold 
that 
any 
relations 
between 
law 
and 
morality 
are 
entirely 
contingent. 
Of 
course, 
there 
are 
good 
laws 
and 
legal 
systems, 
and 
this 
fact 
may 
even 
have 
deep 
roots 
in 
human 
nature. 
It 
may 
be 
rooted 
in 
a 
desire 
that 
people 
generally 
have, 
to 
some 
degree 
or 
other, 
to 
be 
virtuous. 
It 
may 
also 
be 
rooted 
in 
facts 
about 
human 
frailty: 
since 
any 
given 
person 
is 
vulnerable 
to 
practically 
any 
other 
person, 
it 
is 
ceteris 
paribus 
in 
one’s 
interest 
to 
live 
under 
the 
dominion 
of 
a 
fair 
legal 
system.[9] 
Still, 
according 
to 
the 
view 
in 
question, 
there 
is 
nothing 
self-contradictory 
or 
absurd 
in 
the 
thought 
of 
an 
entirely 
wicked 
or 
amoral 
legal 
system. 
To 
the 
extent 
that 
we 
are 
prone 
to 
see 
laws 
in 
terms 
of 
morality, 
we 
are 
guilty 
of 
some 
kind 
of 
blunder.[10] 


§ 
Ronald 
Dworkin 
is 
one 
of 
those 
who 
thinks 
that 
there 
are 
important, 
necessary 
relations 
between 
the 
concepts 
of 
law 
and 
morality. 
In 
connection 
with 
this, 
Dworkin 
argues 
against 
a 
position 
that 
he 
refers 
to 
as 
“positivism”. 



He 
says 
that 
positivism 
consists 
of 
three 
theses. 


(i) 
Laws 
are 
either 
applied 
or 
not 
applied, 
and 
can 
no 
more 
be 
interpreted 
than 
the 
rules 
of 
chess. 
When 
a 
judge 
“interprets” 
the 
law, 
he 
is 
creating 
new 
law; 
and 
when 
a 
judge 
exercises 
his 
so-called 
“judicial 
discretion”, 
he 
is 
either 
applying 
existing 
statutes 
or 
he 
is 
creating 
new 
law 
on 
the 
spot.[11] 
(ii) 
The 
law 
is 
nothing 
other 
than 
a 
set 
of 
rules. 
Consider 
the 
various 
statutes 
that 
fill 
our 
law 
books. 
Those 
are 
the 
law, 
and 
nothing 
else 
is. 
Any 
principle 
that 
hasn’t 
been 
converted 
into 
a 
statute 
is 
no 
part 
of 
the 
law. 
For 
example, 
consider 
the 
reasonable 
ethical 
principle 
that 
one 
shouldn’t 
be 
allowed 
to 
profit 
from 
his 
own 
wrongdoing. 
If 
there 
isn’t 
a 
statute 
explicitly 
forbidding 
one 
to 
profit 
from 
wrongdoing, 
then 
a 
judge 
who 
bases 
a 
decision 
on 
that 
principle 
is 
simply 
making 
up 
new 
law. 
(iii) 
For 
something 
to 
be 
a 
law, 
it 
has 
to 
have 
a 
certain 
“pedigree”, 
i.e. 
it 
has 
to 
issue 
from 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
authority. 
So 
a 
moral 
principle 
is 
no 
part 
of 
the 
law 
unless 
the 
relevant 
authority 
wants 
it 
to 
be.[12] 
Dworkin 
argues 
that 
each 
of 
(i)-(iii) 
is 
false. 
Here 
two 
separate 
issues 
arise. 
First, 
are 
Dworkin’s 
criticisms 
of 
(i)-(iii) 
cogent? 
Second, 
supposing 
that 
they 
are 
cogent, 
what 
relevance 
does 
that 
have 
to 
the 
question 
of 
whether 
laws 
must 
have 
an 
element 
of 
morality? 
Dworkin’s 
implicit 
answer 
is: 
“Given 
that 
(i)-(iii) 
are 
wrong, 
it 
follows 
that 
law 
necessarily 
embodies 
some 
kind 
of 
morality.” 


In 
the 
present 
work, 
I 
will 
argue 
that 
Dworkin’s 
criticisms 
of 
(i)-(iii) 
are 



not 
cogent 
and 
that 
(i)-(iii) 
are 
in 
fact 
correct. 
I 
will 
also 
argue 
that, 
even 
if 
(i)-(iii) 
were 
completely 
wrong, 
it 
would 
in 
no 
way 
follow 
that 
there 
were 
a 
significant 
necessary 
connection 
between 
law 
and 
morality. 
The 
question 
of 
whether 
morality 
and 
the 
law 
are 
internally 
related 
is 
independent 
of 
the 
question 
of 
whether 
(i)-(iii) 
are 
correct. 


But 
I 
will 
also 
argue 
that, 
despite 
everything 
just 
said, 
there 
is 
a 
deep, 
internal 
connection 
between 
the 
concepts 
of 
law 
and 
morality. 
Dworkin 
has 
misidentified 
the 
nature 
of 
this 
connection, 
and 
his 
attempts 
to 
prove 
the 
existence 
of 
such 
a 
connection 
are 
less 
than 
probative. 
But 
despite 
these 
facts, 
and 
despite 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
are 
wicked 
legal 
systems, 
it 
is 
impossible 
on 
purely 
conceptual 
grounds 
that 
any 
legal 
system 
should 
altogether 
fail 
to 
incorporate 
some 
kind 
of 
morality. 
In 
connection 
with 
this, 
we 
will 
find 
an 
objective 
basis 
for 
our 
pre-theoretic 
intuition 
that 
there 
is 
some 
sense 
in 
which 
one 
is 
always 
supposed 
to 
obey 
the 
law. 


§ 
It 
may 
be 
appropriate 
to 
say 
a 
word 
on 
the 
basic 
structure 
of 
the 
present 
work. 
In 
chapter 
4, 
we 
will 
argue 
that 
Dworkin’s 
arguments 
against 
(i)-(iii) 
are 
fallacious; 
and, 
further, 
that 
(i)-(iii) 
are 
correct; 
but, 
finally, 
that 
(contrary 
to 
what 
Dworkin 
believes) 
the 
truth 
of 
(i)-(iii) 
in 
no 
way 
warrants 
the 
rejection 
of 
a 
moralistic 
conception 
of 
law. 


In 
chapter 
5, 
we 
will 
identify 
what 
I 
believe 
to 
be 
the 
misunderstandings 
concerning 
morality 
that 
have 
thwarted 
attempts 
to 
identify 
the 
relationship 
between 
law 
and 
morality. 
We 
will 
focus 
on 
the 
fact, 
already 
discussed, 
that 
moral 
principles 
have 
a 
dimension 
of 
weight. 


In 
chapter 
6, 
we 
will 
discuss 
the 
defense 
of 
positivism 
found 
in 
Hart’s 
classic 
paper 
“the 
Separation 
of 
Law 
and 
Morals.” 
We 
will 
find 
that 
two 
of 
Hart’s 
apparently 
more 
compelling 
arguments 
are 
not 
valid, 
since 
they 
incorporate 
an 
untenable, 
binary 
conception 
of 
morality 
and 
also 
a 



misunderstanding 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
government. 


In 
chapter 
7, 
we 
will 
develop 
the 
points 
concerning 
government 
outlined 
in 
the 
previous 
chapter. 
We 
will 
argue 
that, 
given 
a 
plausible 
conception 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
government, 
it 
follows 
quite 
directly 
that, 
even 
though 
there 
are 
morally 
unsatisfactory 
laws 
and 
legal 
systems, 
laws 
must 
be 
seen 
as 
attempts 
to 
protect 
moral 
goods 
and 
also 
that, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
conceptual 
necessity, 
a 
legal 
system 
cannot 
completely 
fail 
to 
do 
a 
non-trivial 
amount 
of 
good. 


In 
chapter 
8, 
we 
will 
argue 
that, 
in 
light 
of 
some 
general 
semantic 
principles, 
we 
must 
regard 
laws 
as 
being 
what 
we 
will 
call 
narrow-scope 
assurances. 
Thanks 
to 
this 
seemingly 
technical 
and 
minor 
point, 
our 
analysis, 
unlike 
other 
moralistic 
analyses 
of 
law, 
will 
not 
have 
to 
be 
revisionist 
to 
any 
degree. 
In 
other 
words, 
our 
analysis 
will 
never 
force 
us 
to 
regard 
as 
a 
non-law 
anything 
that 
we 
pre-theoretically 
regard 
as 
a 
law, 
or 
to 
regard 
as 
a 
law 
anything 
that 
we 
pre-theoretically 
regard 
as 
a 
non-law. 


In 
chapter 
9, 
I 
will 
discuss 
the 
plausible 
point, 
recently 
made 
by 
an 
eminent 
philosopher 
of 
law, 
that 
the 
laws 
of 
a 
brutal 
dictator 
can 
be 
as 
lacking 
in 
moral 
content 
as 
the 
demands 
of 
a 
gunman. 
I 
will 
discuss 
my 
reasons 
for 
holding 
that, 
even 
though 
a 
brutal 
dictator 
may 
be 
in 
the 
same 
psychological 
category 
as 
a 
gunman, 
it 
would 
only 
be 
in 
rather 
singular 
circumstances 
that 
the 
dictator’s 
laws 
were 
in 
the 
same 
moral 
category 
as 
a 
gunman’s 
threats. 
In 
this 
section, 
we 
will 
discuss 
some 
important 
insights 
regarding 
causality, 
due 
to 
Phillip 
Pettit 
and 
developed 
by 
Frank 
Jackson 
(in 
collaboration 
with 
Pettit), 
that 
we 
will 
find 
to 
have 
a 
manifold 
relevance 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
law. 


In 
chapter 
10, 
we 
will 
delineate 
the 
moral 
structure 
of 
legal 
obligation. 
We 
will 
see 
that 
legal 
obligation 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
moral 
obligation; 
and 
we 
will 
already 
have 
seen 
(in 
previous 
chapters) 
that 
all 
laws 
have 
a 
moral 
component. 
But, 
in 
this 
chapter, 
we 
will 
find 
that 
the 
relationship 
between 



these 
two 
facts, 
though 
deep 
and 
necessary, 
is 
anything 
but 
straightforward. 
In 
connection 
with 
this, 
we 
will 
find 
reason 
to 
reject 
wholesale 
some 
prima 
facie 
reasonable 
attempts 
to 
find 
a 
moral 
basis 
for 
legal 
obligation. 


In 
chapter 
11, 
the 
topic 
of 
international 
law 
will 
be 
discussed. 
We 
will 
make 
a 
case 
for 
each 
of 
the 
following 
four 
claims. 
First, 
there 
is 
currently 
no 
international 
law. 
Second, 
there 
could 
be 
international 
law, 
at 
least 
in 
principle. 
Third, 
that 
the 
conditions 
under 
which 
international 
could 
exist 
would 
be 
bear 
extremely 
little 
resemblance 
to 
current 
international 
conditions. 
Fourth, 
and 
most 
importantly, 
the 
existence 
of 
international 
law 
wouldn’t 
necessarily 
be 
desirable 
from 
an 
ethical 
standpoint. 


Finally, 
in 
chapter 
12, 
we 
will 
discuss 
the 
concepts 
of 
legal 
interpretation 
and 
of 
international 
law. 
It 
will 
be 
argued 
that, 
pace 
Blackstone, 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
laws 
are 
“interpreted” 
is 
not 
comparable 
to 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
a 
coded 
transmission 
or 
an 
EKG-printout 
is 
interpreted. 
Paradigm 
cases 
of 
interpretation 
involves 
the 
identification 
of 
pre-existing 
realities. 
In 
correctly 
interpreting 
the 
data 
generated 
by 
an 
EKG, 
a 
cardiologist 
is 
identifying 
the 
pre-existing 
fact 
that 
patient 
Smith 
has 
a 
valve 
defect. 
In 
correctly 
interpreting 
an 
intercepted 
message, 
a 
code-breaker 
is 
identifying 
the 
pre-existing 
fact 
that 
certain 
people 
have 
transmitted 
a 
certain 
message 
(“we 
are 
going 
to 
attack 
at 
dawn”). 
In 
each 
of 
these 
cases, 
interpretation 
consists 
in 
identifying 
an 
existing 
reality. 


What 
judges 
do 
is 
not 
comparable 
to 
this. 
Judges 
do 
not 
identify, 
but 
rather 
extend, 
existing 
law. 
That 
is 
why, 
no 
matter 
how 
a 
judge 
rules, 
his 
ruling 
is 
ipso 
facto 
what 
the 
law 
henceforth 
requires. 
(Of 
course, 
a 
later 
ruling 
may 
overturn 
the 
first. 
But 
that 
only 
confirms 
the 
point 
that 
judicial 
rulings 
define, 
and 
therefore 
do 
not 
identify, 
the 
law.) 


But 
even 
though 
judicial 
interpretations 
are 
extensions, 
and 
not 
identifications, 
of 
existing 
law, 
such 
interpretations 
are 
not 
mere 
legislation, 



and 
are 
answerable 
to 
objective 
standards. 
Consequently, 
some 
legal 
interpretations 
are 
truer 
to 
existing 
law 
than 
others. 
The 
Supreme 
Court 
is 
not 
making 
up 
law 
(at 
least 
not 
necessarily). 
But 
it 
isn’t 
interpreting 
law, 
at 
least 
not 
in 
any 
paradigmatic 
sense 
of 
the 
word 
“interpret.” 


Chapter 
4 
Dworkin 
on 
the 
separation 
of 
law 
and 
morality 


Before 
we 
consider 
what 
Dworkin 
says, 
let 
us 
ask: 
what 
do 
(i)-(iii) 
have 
in 
common? 
Why 
do 
they 
form 
one 
doctrine, 
as 
opposed 
to 
three 
separate 
ones? 


Each 
of 
(i)-(iii) 
is 
a 
different 
way 
of 
saying 
that, 
from 
a 
strictly 
moral 
standpoint, 
what 
counts 
as 
law 
is 
quite 
arbitrary. 
Consider 
the 
various 
regulations 
involved 
in 
military 
life 
or 
in 
the 
administration 
of 
some 
bureaucracy. 
These 
regulations 
are 
obviously 
not 
moral 
laws. 
It 
isn’t 
a 
law 
of 
morality 
that 
you 
must 
use 
a 
number-two 
pencil 
when 
filling 
out 
a 
certain 
form. 
(ii) 
basically 
says 
that 
“the 
law” 
consists 
of 
nothing 
other 
than 
such 
regulations. 
Of 
course, 
(ii) 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
existence 
of 
just 
laws. 
But 
it 
is 
also 
consistent 
with 
the 
existence 
of 
laws 
that 
are 
immoral 
or 
lacking 
in 
any 
kind 
of 
morality, 
whether 
positive 
or 
negative. 


Let 
us 
turn 
our 
attention 
to 
(iii). 
The 
laws 
of 
morality 
obviously 
don’t 
have 
anything 
to 
do 
with 
earthly 
authority. 
Their 
basis 
lies 
in 
Pure 
Reason 
or 
in 
the 
Form 
of 
the 
Good.[13] 
(iii) 
says 
that 
laws 
(in 
the 
legal 
sense) 
must 
issue 
from 
some 
earthly 
authority. 
So 
(iii) 
says, 
or 
suggests, 
that 
morality 
is 
one 
thing, 
law 
another. 


Here 
a 
qualification 
is 
in 
order. 
(iii) 
doesn’t 
say 
that 
for 
something 
to 
be 
a 
law, 
it 
is 
necessary 
and 
sufficient 
that 
it 
issue 
from 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
earthly 



authority. 
It 
is 
left 
open 
whether 
it 
must 
satisfy 
additional 
conditions. 
So 
depending 
on 
what, 
if 
any, 
additional 
conditions 
there 
are, 
(iii) 
is 
compatible 
with 
the 
view 
that 
laws 
must 
be 
moral. 
For 
example, 
it 
could 
be 
said 
that 
a 
law 
is 
something 
that 
(a) 
meets 
certain 
standards 
of 
morality 
and 
(b) 
issues 
from 
certain 
kinds 
of 
earthly 
authorities. 
(This 
is, 
in 
fact, 
what 
I 
will 
argue 
to 
be 
the 
case.) 
But 
given 
that 
moral 
principles 
don’t 
have 
earthly 
origins, 
(iii) 
certainly 
suggests 
that 
law 
and 
morality 
are 
distinct. 


(i) 
is 
closely 
connected 
with 
the 
other 
two. 
Rules 
are 
things 
that 
people 
– 
congressman, 
presidents, 
dictators, 
and 
so 
on 
– 
make 
up. 
(i) 
says 
that, 
when 
a 
judge 
goes 
beyond 
these 
man-made 
things, 
he 
is 
going 
beyond 
the 
law 
itself. 
This 
straightforwardly 
implies 
that 
rules 
exhaust 
the 
law, 
i.e. 
it 
entails 
the 
truth 
of 
(ii). 
It 
also 
implies 
that, 
if 
morality 
should 
ever 
become 
part 
of 
the 
law, 
it 
is 
only 
by 
the 
grace 
of 
some 
rule 
or 
ruling. 
We 
may 
illustrate 
this 
with 
a 
bit 
of 
fiction. 
A 
certain 
judge 
must 
decide 
a 
case. 
None 
of 
the 
rules 
are 
on 
point. 
Since 
the 
rules 
are 
silent, 
the 
judge 
bases 
his 
decision 
on 
some 
ethical 
principle. 
If 
(i) 
is 
right, 
then 
by 
going 
beyond 
the 
rules, 
the 
judge 
was 
going 
beyond 
the 
law. 
This 
means 
that 
his 
decision 
was 
based 
on 
an 
ethical 
principle 
that 
was 
not 
already 
a 
part 
of 
the 
law: 
that 
principle 
became 
a 
part 
of 
the 
law 
only 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
was 
incorporated 
into 
the 
judge’s 
ruling. 
So 
(i) 
implies 
that 
morals 
are 
a 
part 
of 
the 
law 
only 
when 
rules 
and 
rulings 
allow 
them 
to 
be. 
If 
it 
is 
granted 
– 
as 
it 
surely 
must 
be 
– 
that 
rules 
and 
rulings 
may 
be 
completely 
amoral, 
it 
would 
certainly 
seem 
to 
follow 
that 
(i) 
entails 
that 
the 
law 
needn’t 
embody 
any 
morality. 
(Later 
I 
will 
argue 
that, 
in 
fact, 
even 
if 
(i) 
is 
true, 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
laws 
needn’t 
embody 
any 
morality. 
Hence 
the 
word 
“seems” 
in 
the 
second 
to 
last 
sentence.) 


In 
conclusion, 
each 
of 
(i)-(iii) 
is 
a 
way 
of 
saying 
that 
laws 
are 
things 
that 
people 
make 
up, 
and 
no 
more 
have 
to 
embody 
any 
morality 
than 
do 
the 
army



regulations 
concerning 
the 
kind 
of 
boot-polish 
one 
may 
use. 


§ 
But 
if 
each 
of 
(i)-(iii) 
should 
turn 
out 
to 
be 
false, 
it 
wouldn’t 
follow 
that 
laws 
do 
have 
some 
kind 
of 
necessary 
connection 
with 
the 
moral 
law. 
Suppose 
that 
laws 
don’t 
have 
to 
have 
a 
certain 
pedigree. 
It 
doesn’t 
follow 
that 
they 
must 
be 
moral. 
That 
would 
follow 
only 
if 
it 
could 
be 
shown 
that 
their 
not 
having 
to 
issue 
from 
an 
earthly 
authority 
entailed 
that 
they 
did 
have 
to 
emanate 
from 
the 
Form 
of 
the 
Good, 
or 
some 
such. 
But, 
as 
we 
will 
see, 
there 
is 
a 
third 
option. 


Suppose 
that 
(i) 
is 
false, 
i.e. 
that 
when 
judges 
“interpret” 
statutes, 
they 
are 
not 
necessarily 
making 
up 
new 
law. 
It 
doesn’t 
follow, 
as 
Hart[14] 
pointed 
out, 
that 
judicial 
interpretation 
provides 
a 
contact 
point 
between 
law 
and 
morality. 
Suppose 
that 
the 
principle 
governing 
the 
judge’s 
interpretations 
is 
this: 


(*) 
I 
must 
interpret 
the 
statutes 
in 
the 
way 
that 
is 
the 
most 
convenient 
from 
the 
viewpoint 
of 
the 
nefarious 
mega-corporation 
that 
is 
secretly 
running 
this 
country. 
To 
the 
extent 
that 
a 
given 
statute 
is 
ambiguous 
or 
vague, 
I 
must 
delineate 
it 
in 
the 
way 
that 
best 
serves 
the 
interests 
of 
that 
corporation. 


In 
that 
case, 
presumably, 
the 
falsity 
of 
(i) 
wouldn’t 
demand 
that 
there 
be 
some 
intersection 
between 
the 
law 
and 
morality.[15] 


Finally, 
suppose 
that 
(ii) 
is 
wrong. 
That 
by 
itself 
doesn’t 
mean 
that 
there 
is 
any 
component 
of 
moral 
principle 
to 
the 
law. 
In 
effect, 
we 
just 
saw 
this. 
Suppose 
that 
(*) 
is 
the 
principle 
underlying 
judicial 
interpretation, 
but 
that 
(*) 
were 
not 
itself 
one 
of 
the 
statutes. 
In 
that 
case, 
the 
law 
would 
include 
something 
other 
than 
various 
statutes, 
and 
(ii) 
would 
be 
false. 
But 
the 
falsity 



of 
(ii) 
plainly 
wouldn’t 
entail 
that 
there 
was 
an 
element 
of 
moral 
principle 
to 
the 
law. 
The 
principle 
would 
be 
purely 
pragmatic. 


Given 
what 
we’ve 
just 
said, 
it 
follows 
that 
even 
if 
all 
of 
(i)-(iii) 
were 
false, 
it 
wouldn’t 
necessarily 
follow 
that 
the 
law 
embodied 
any 
kind 
of 
morality. 
So 
we 
must 
remember 
that, 
even 
if 
Dworkin’s 
criticisms 
of 
(i)-(iii) 
go 
through, 
that 
by 
itself 
doesn’t 
entail 
that 
there 
is 
an 
element 
of 
morality 
to 
the 
law. 


Dworkin’s 
Criticisms 
of 
(i)-(iii) 


Let 
us 
now 
consider 
Dworkin’s 
criticisms 
of 
(i)-(iii). 
First 
of 
all, 
we 
must 
distinguish 
laws 
from 
what 
we 
call 
“the 
law.”[16] 
When 
we 
talk 
about 
particular 
laws, 
we 
are 
not 
referring 
to 
diffuse 
ethical 
principles, 
but 
to 
specific 
statutes 
– 
we 
are 
referring 
to 
penal 
code 
76.5 
subsection 
B, 
or 
some 
such. 
But 
unless 
it 
could 
be 
shown 
that 
such 
particular 
laws 
exhausted 
the 
law, 
it 
would 
not 
follow 
that 
the 
latter 
was 
nothing 
but 
a 
set 
of 
rules.[17] 


In 
Dworkin’s 
view, 
it 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
empirical 
fact 
that 
the 
law 
includes 
principles 
that 
are 
not 
explicitly 
mentioned 
anywhere 
in 
the 
rule 
books. 
In 
defense 
of 
this 
view, 
he 
cites 
two 
landmark 
cases. 


In 
Riggs 
v. 
Palmer 
a 
New 
York 
court 
had 
to 
adjudicate 
the 
following 
problem. 
A 
young 
man 
stood 
to 
inherit 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
money 
from 
his 
still 
alive 
and 
healthy 
grandfather. 
The 
young 
man 
decided 
not 
to 
wait, 
and 
killed 
his 
grandfather.[18] 


Obviously 
there 
was 
a 
law 
forbidding 
murder, 
and 
the 
young 
man 
was 
found 
guilty 
of 
breaking 
that 
law. 
But, 
at 
the 
time, 
there 
was 
no 
statute 
saying 
that 
one 
forfeits 
one’s 
inheritance 
if 
one 
kills 
the 
testator. 
Nonetheless 
the 
courts 
decided 
that 
the 
young 
man 
had 
forfeited 
his 
inheritance. 
The 
principle 
at 
work 
was 
that 
one 
should 
not 
be 
allowed 
to 
profit 
from 
wrong 
doing 
or 
illegal 
action. 



Dworkin 
also 
discusses 
the 
case 
of 
Henningsen 
v. 
Bloomfield 
Motors. 
Henningsen 
bought 
a 
car. 
He 
signed 
a 
contract 
absolving 
the 
car-maker 
from 
any 
criminal 
liability 
in 
the 
event 
that 
he 
(Henningsen) 
should 
be 
injured 
as 
a 
result 
of 
some 
defect 
in 
the 
car 
that 
the 
automaker 
could 
have 
foreseen. 
The 
car 
did 
have 
such 
a 
defect, 
and 
that 
did 
lead 
to 
Henningsen’s 
sustaining 
severe 
injuries. 
Henningsen 
sued 
Bloomfield 
motors. 
The 
courts 
decided 
that 
the 
contract 
was 
void, 
and 
found 
for 
Henningsen. 
The 
principle 
at 
work 
was 
that 
a 
valid 
legal 
contract 
must 
meet 
certain 
minimum 
standards 
of 
decency 
and 
fairness. 
The 
contract 
in 
question 
did 
not 
meet 
these 
standards: 
hence 
the 
court’s 
decision.[19] 


On 
the 
face 
of 
it, 
these 
two 
cases 
provide 
us 
with 
clear 
evidence 
that 
moral 
principles 
are 
part 
of 
the 
law, 
and 
also 
that 
the 
law 
is 
not 
confined 
to 
the 
rules 
that 
are 
written 
down 
in 
the 
books. 


§ 
But, 
of 
course, 
given 
only 
what 
we’ve 
said, 
the 
positivist 
by 
no 
means 
has 
to 
concede 
defeat. 
There 
are 
two 
paths 
he 
can 
take. 
First, 
he 
can 
say: 
“the 
judges 
in 
those 
cases 
were 
going 
beyond 
the 
law; 
they 
were 
doing 
the 
right 
thing, 
not 
the 
legal 
thing.” 
As 
we 
will 
later 
see, 
there 
is 
much 
to 
be 
said 
for 
this 
position. 


The 
positivist 
could 
also 
say 
that 
the 
ethical 
principles 
guiding 
the 
judges 
were 
really 
de 
facto 
rules. 
There 
is 
a 
rule 
in 
our 
legal 
system 
requiring 
judges 
to 
nullify 
absurdly 
immoral 
contracts; 
there 
is 
a 
rule 
requiring 
judges 
not 
let 
a 
murderer 
benefit 
from 
his 
crime. 


Here 
Dworkin 
gives 
us 
a 
penetrating 
(and, 
I 
believe, 
entirely 
correct) 
discussion 
of 
the 
distinction 
between 
rules 
and 
principles. 
Principles 
have 
a 
“dimension 
of 
weight.” 
Rules 
do 
not. 
A 
rule 
either 
applies 
or 
it 
doesn’t. 
Principles 
can 
apply 
to 
varying 
degrees. 


Suppose 
there 
is 
a 
law 
saying 
that 
three 
people 
must 
witness 
the 
signing 



of 
a 
will 
if 
that 
will 
is 
to 
be 
valid. 
This 
rule 
either 
applies 
or 
it 
doesn’t. 
If 
only 
one 
person 
witnesses 
the 
signing 
of 
the 
will, 
then 
that 
rule 
voids 
that 
will. 
If 
three 
or 
more 
people 
witness 
the 
signing, 
then 
that 
rule 
does 
not 
void 
the 
will 
(though 
some 
other 
rule 
may).[20] 


A 
consequence 
is 
that 
a 
coherent 
legal 
system 
cannot 
have 
two 
conflicting 
rules. 
It 
cannot 
have 
one 
rule 
saying 
that 
the 
signing 
of 
a 
will 
must 
be 
witnessed 
by 
three 
people 
if 
that 
will 
is 
to 
be 
valid, 
and 
another 
rule 
saying 
that 
only 
two 
people 
must 
be 
present. 
One 
of 
those 
rules 
would 
have 
to 
go. 


Of 
course, 
every 
rule 
has 
a 
certain 
degree 
of 
vagueness.[21] 
What 
if, 
in 
the 
future, 
there 
are 
cyborgs? 
(A 
cyborg 
is 
a 
half-robot, 
half-person.) 
Do 
they 
count 
as 
possible 
witnesses 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
the 
law 
just 
discussed? 
What 
about 
people 
with 
autism? 
People 
who 
are 
extremely 
drunk? 
People 
who 
are 
slightly 
drunk, 
but 
still 
more 
or 
less 
functional? 


But 
for 
a 
rule 
to 
be 
vague 
or 
indeterminate 
is 
not 
for 
it 
to 
have 
a 
dimension 
of 
weight. 
If 
cyborgs 
are 
people, 
then 
they 
are 
viable 
witnesses. 
If 
not, 
not. 
The 
question 
is 
whether 
the 
rule 
applies, 
not 
how 
much.[22] 


Principles 
are 
not 
binary 
and 
have 
a 
dimension 
of 
weight. 
It 
is 
not 
a 
rule 
that 
people 
cannot 
profit 
from 
their 
own 
wrong-doing. 
If 
this 
were 
a 
rule, 
then 
all 
sly 
deal-making, 
all 
wheeling 
and 
dealing, 
would 
be 
against 
the 
law. 
There 
would 
be 
no 
commercial 
activity 
at 
all, 
and 
our 
economy 
would 
grind 
to 
a 
halt. 


But 
this 
doesn’t 
mean 
that 
connivance 
and 
manipulation 
are 
to 
be 
given 
free 
reign. 
Judges 
give 
weight 
to 
the 
principle 
that 
business 
should 
be 
conducted 
with 
decency. 
But 
it 
is 
to 
be 
balanced 
against 
other 
competing 
principles. 
Among 
them 
are: 


the 
right 
of 
people 
to 
engage 
in 
financial 
dealings 
with 
one 
another 
should 



not 
be 
unduly 
restricted; 


and 


people 
are 
entitled 
to 
pursue 
prosperity 
and 
personal 
fulfillment.[23] 


Our 
legal 
system 
comprises 
the 
principle 
that 
people 
should 
be 
allowed 
to 
pursue 
prosperity. 
It 
also 
comprises 
the 
principle 
that 
business 
must 
be 
conducted 
with 
a 
certain 
decency 
and 
that, 
consequently, 
the 
pursuit 
of 
prosperity 
should 
be 
subject 
to 
certain 
restraints. 
But 
our 
legal 
system 
is 
not 
incoherent 
on 
account 
of 
comprising 
both 
those 
principles. 
This 
is 
because, 
unlike 
rules, 
principles 
are 
not 
binary, 
and 
apply 
to 
varying 
degrees. 
Consequently, 
the 
existence 
within 
a 
single 
legal 
system 
of 
two 
opposed 
principles 
does 
not 
constitute 
a 
contradiction, 
though 
it 
does 
create 
certain 
tensions 
that 
judges 
must 
manage. 


Since 
principles 
have 
a 
dimension 
of 
weight, 
they 
are 
not 
rules. 
It 
is 
therefore 
not 
in 
the 
cards 
to 
say 
that 
ethical 
principles, 
such 
as 
those 
motivating 
the 
judges 
in 
Riggs 
and 
Henningsen, 
are 
actually 
rules. 
So 
(ii) 
is 
wrong.[24] 


For 
these 
very 
reasons, 
it 
follows 
that 
(iii) 
is 
wrong. 
Moral 
principles 
are 
not 
created 
by 
governments 
or 
by 
any 
other 
earthly 
authority. 
We 
just 
saw 
that 
they 
are 
a 
part 
of 
the 
law. 
Therefore 
(iii) 
is 
wrong. 


§ 
Let 
us 
put 
forth 
the 
reasoning 
behind 
(i) 
before 
we 
consider 
what 
Dworkin 
says 
about 
it. 
Rules 
are 
not 
interpreted: 
they 
are 
either 
applied 
or 
not 
applied.[25] 
You 
don’t 
interpret 
a 
mathematical 
rule 
(e.g. 
a 
function 
from 
numbers 
to 
other 
numbers); 
you 
either 
apply 
it 
or 
you 
don’t. 
For 
the 
same 



reason, 
you 
don’t 
interpret 
a 
legal 
rule: 
you 
either 
apply 
it 
or 
you 
don’t.[26] 
This 
isn’t 
to 
say 
that 
no 
intelligence 
is 
needed 
to 
know 
how 
to 
apply 
the 
law: 
just 
as 
intelligence 
may 
be 
needed 
to 
find 
an 
integral, 
so 
intelligence 
may 
be 
needed 
to 
know 
how 
to 
apply 
the 
law. 
But 
the 
concept 
of 
interpretation 
doesn’t 
apply 
in 
either 
case. 
That 
concept 
applies 
only 
where 
there 
is 
no 
definite 
fact 
of 
the 
matter 
– 
only 
where 
a 
certain 
indeterminacy 
prevails. 
So 
legal 
interpretation 
is 
necessary 
precisely 
where 
there 
is 
an 
indeterminacy 
or 
gap 
in 
the 
law, 
and 
it 
therefore 
consists 
in 
creating 
law 
where 
there 
was 
previously 
an 
absence 
of 
law. 
Put 
another 
way, 
judicial 
“discretion” 
is 
necessary 
precisely 
when 
there 
is 
a 
gap 
in 
the 
law, 
and 
the 
exercise 
of 
such 
discretion 
therefore 
consists 
in 
the 
inventing 
of 
new 
law. 


Dworkin’s 
criticism 
of 
(i) 
is 
a 
masterpiece 
of 
philosophical 
analysis.[27] 
First 
of 
all, 
the 
term 
“discretion” 
has 
different 
meanings. 
Sometimes 
when 
we 
say 
that 
a 
judgment 
involves 
“discretion”, 
we 
mean 
only 
that 
it 
is 
not 
mechanical 
and 
embodies 
sensitivity 
to 
the 
relevant 
principles. 


On 
this 
disambiguation 
of 
the 
term 
“discretion”, 
the 
fact 
that 
judges 
sometimes 
exercise 
discretion 
in 
no 
way 
supports 
(i). 
Given 
only 
that 
a 
problem 
cannot 
be 
solved 
mechanically, 
and 
that 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
“discretion” 
is 
involved, 
it 
doesn’t 
follow 
that 
there 
is 
no 
right 
answer. 
To 
say 
otherwise 
would 
be 
to 
say 
that 
there 
are 
no 
truths 
outside 
of 
first 
order 
sentential 
logic.[28] 
The 
fact 
that 
judges 
have 
to 
exercise 
discretion 
means 
only 
that 
some 
understanding 
of 
the 
relevant 
legal 
precepts 
is 
involved. 
It 
doesn’t 
imply 
that 
the 
law 
is 
absent 
and 
that 
the 
judge 
must 
therefore 
fill 
the 
void 
with 
a 
new 
law 
of 
his 
own 
making. 


To 
reinforce 
this 
point 
of 
Dworkin’s, 
I 
would 
briefly 
like 
to 
go 
beyond 
what 
Dworkin 
explicitly 
says. 
The 
term 
“indeterminate” 
has 
two 
meanings: 
one 
ontological, 
the 
other 
epistemological. 
If 
we 
say 
that 
Smith’s 
whereabouts 
are 
“indeterminate”, 
we 
mean 
that 
we 
don’t 
know 
where 
Smith 



is; 
we 
don’t 
mean 
that 
there 
is 
no 
objective 
fact 
of 
the 
matter. 
If 
we 
say 
that 
it 
is 
indeterminate 
whether 
a 
person 
who 
is 
5 
ft 
10 
inches 
is 
tall, 
we 
mean 
that 
there 
is 
no 
objective 
fact 
of 
the 
matter: 
the 
concept 
of 
tallness 
leaves 
the 
matter 
open.[29] 
It 
is 
true 
that, 
in 
some 
cases, 
the 
law 
is 
“indeterminate”. 
But 
that 
doesn’t 
necessarily 
mean 
that 
there 
is 
no 
fact 
as 
to 
what 
the 
law 
demands. 
It 
could 
mean 
simply 
that, 
as 
of 
yet, 
it 
is 
unknown 
what 
the 
law 
demands. 
Therefore, 
the 
existence 
of 
“indeterminacy” 
in 
the 
law 
doesn’t 
entail 
the 
existence 
of 
gaps 
in 
the 
law, 
unless 
the 
indeterminacy 
in 
question 
is 
ontological. 
By 
itself, 
the 
fact 
that 
such 
indeterminacy 
calls 
for 
judicial 
discretion 
does 
not 
show 
that 
when 
a 
judge 
exercises 
discretion, 
he 
is 
making 
up 
new 
law. 
It 
would 
have 
to 
be 
shown 
that 
the 
indeterminacy 
in 
question 
was 
ontological, 
not 
epistemological. 
Otherwise 
the 
discretion 
involved 
would 
be 
the 
kind 
that 
characterizes 
any 
search 
for 
objective 
truth 
(outside 
of 
first 
order 
sentential 
logic, 
and 
other 
domains 
where 
all 
issues 
can 
be 
settled 
through 
mechanical 
decision-procedures[30]). 
So 
the 
positivist’s 
argument 
seems 
to 
involve 
an 
equivocation 
on 
terms 
like 
“indeterminacy” 
and 
“discretion”; 
it 
shifts 
between 
the 
epistemological 
and 
ontological 
interpretations 
of 
those 
words. 


Let 
us 
now 
return 
to 
what 
Dworkin 
himself 
explicitly 
says 
about 
the 
concept 
of 
discretion. 
There 
is 
another 
meaning 
of 
the 
term 
“discretion”. 
Sometimes 
when 
we 
say 
that 
a 
decision 
is 
at 
so 
and 
so’s 
discretion, 
we 
mean 
that 
so 
and 
so’s 
decision 
on 
the 
matter 
cannot 
be 
overturned. 
If 
an 
umpire 
decides 
that 
a 
pitch 
was 
a 
strike, 
then 
that 
decision 
cannot 
be 
overturned. 


On 
this 
disambiguation 
of 
the 
term 
“discretion”, 
the 
fact 
that 
judges 
exercise 
discretion 
in 
no 
way 
supports 
(i). 
Whether 
the 
pitch 
was 
a 
strike 
or 
a 
ball 
is 
at 
the 
umpire’s 
discretion. 
But 
that 
doesn’t 
mean 
that 
there 
was 
no 
fact 
of 
the 
matter. 
It 
means 
that 
the 
umpire 
is 
the 
one 
who 
decides 
what 
the 
fact 
of 
the 
matter 
is. 
Given 
only 
that 
it 
is 
at 
the 
judge’s 
discretion 
how 
to 
apply 
the 



law, 
it 
doesn’t 
follow 
that 
there 
is 
no 
fact 
as 
to 
what 
the 
law 
is. 
It 
follows 
only 
that 
the 
judge 
is 
the 
one 
who 
decides 
what 
that 
fact 
is. 


There 
is 
yet 
another 
disambiguation 
of 
the 
term 
“discretion”. 
Suppose 
the 
law 
requires 
that 
somebody 
convicted 
of 
such 
and 
such 
be 
given 
a 
sentence 
of 
anywhere 
from 
five 
to 
twenty 
years 
in 
jail. 
In 
this 
case, 
it 
is 
at 
the 
judge’s 
discretion 
whether 
to 
hand 
down 
a 
sentence 
of 
five 
years, 
or 
seven, 
or 
twelve. 
But 
the 
existence 
of 
this 
sort 
of 
judicial 
discretion 
provides 
no 
support 
for 
(i). 
If 
the 
judge 
imposes 
a 
sentence 
of 
twelve 
years, 
he 
is 
following, 
not 
creating, 
the 
law. 


There 
is 
one 
last 
disambiguation 
of 
the 
term 
“discretion”, 
and 
this 
one 
is 
by 
far 
the 
most 
important. 
Consider 
Henningsen 
v. 
Bloomfield 
motors. 
The 
judge 
made 
a 
decision. 
But 
the 
decision 
was 
obviously 
not 
predetermined 
by 
the 
statutes. 
In 
fact, 
if 
we 
look 
at 
the 
statutes, 
we 
find 
not 
only 
that 
they 
did 
not 
determine 
that 
decision, 
but 
that 
they 
nearly 
enough 
ruled 
it 
out. 
Going 
by 
what 
the 
rule-books 
say, 
the 
contract 
was 
legal. 
But 
the 
judge 
decided 
on 
grounds 
of 
principle 
that 
the 
contract 
should 
be 
thrown 
out. 
Evidently, 
it 
was 
in 
the 
judge’s 
power 
to 
override 
the 
statutes: 
it 
was 
at 
his 
discretion. 
This 
seems 
to 
mean 
that 
the 
law 
was 
the 
judge’s 
to 
invent. 
Of 
course, 
it 
will 
be 
said 
that 
the 
judge 
“interpreted” 
the 
law, 
and 
did 
not 
invent 
it. 
But 
such 
a 
statement 
appears 
to 
distort 
the 
facts. 


This, 
presumably, 
is 
the 
sort 
of 
thing 
that 
defenders 
of 
(i) 
have 
in 
mind. 
The 
judge 
was 
called 
on 
to 
“interpret” 
the 
law. 
But 
really 
he 
usurped 
it 
and 
replaced 
it 
with 
a 
new 
law. 
So 
legal 
interpretation 
is 
legal 
creation; 
when 
a 
judge 
exercises 
his 
“discretion”, 
he 
is 
making 
up 
new 
law. 


Dworkin’s 
criticism 
of 
this 
argument 
is 
cogent. 
The 
very 
point 
the 
positivist 
is 
trying 
to 
establish 
is 
that 
no 
ethical 
principle 
has 
a 
place 
in 
the 
law, 
unless 
it 
is 
incorporated 
into 
some 
statute. 
Therefore 
the 
positivist 
cannot 
argue 
that, 
since 
the 
judge 
based 
his 
decision 
on 
principles 
not 
already 



embodied 
in 
the 
statutes, 
he 
was 
therefore 
going 
beyond 
the 
law. 
That 
would 
be 
question-begging, 
as 
it 
is 
the 
very 
point 
that 
the 
positivist 
wishes 
to 
establish. 


Critiquing 
Dworkin’s 
Critique 


Our 
background 
knowledge 
about 
American 
culture 
and 
mores 
makes 
it 
hard 
to 
be 
objective 
about 
cases 
like 
the 
ones 
Dworkin 
discusses. 
As 
Americans, 
we 
idolize 
the 
renegade 
detective 
who 
is 
out 
for 
justice 
and 
is 
willing 
to 
break 
the 
rules. 
We 
spurn 
the 
rule-bound 
police-chief 
who 
forces 
him 
to 
do 
things 
“by 
the 
book”, 
making 
it 
practically 
impossible 
to 
catch 
the 
bad 
guy.[31] 
Such 
background 
knowledge 
tends 
to 
color 
our 
analysis 
of 
the 
cases 
that 
Dworkin 
discusses. 
But 
the 
following 
imaginary 
scenario 
gives 
us 
a 
way 
of 
filtering 
out 
those 
biases. 


You 
are 
a 
famous 
judge. 
Because 
of 
your 
well-known 
legal 
prowess, 
a 
foreign 
government 
asks 
you 
to 
settle 
a 
case 
in 
their 
court-system. 
You 
don’t 
know 
anything 
about 
the 
customs 
of 
this 
other 
country. 
In 
particular, 
you 
don’t 
know 
if 
they 
are 
extremely 
liberal 
or 
aggressively 
traditional. 
You 
are 
told 
at 
the 
outset 
that 
your 
job 
is 
to 
apply 
their 
legal 
system 
as 
strictly 
as 
possible. 
Like 
anyone 
else 
who 
breaks 
their 
law, 
you 
will 
be 
severely 
punished 
if 
it 
is 
felt 
that 
you 
are 
replacing 
their 
legal 
system 
with 
your 
own 
conception 
of 
justice. 
The 
case 
you 
must 
decide 
is 
an 
exact 
analogue 
of 
Henningsen 
v. 
Bloomfield 
motors. 
How 
would 
you 
decide? 


It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
path 
of 
caution 
would 
be 
to 
rule 
against 
the 
plaintiff 
--to 
uphold 
the 
contract 
and 
dismiss 
the 
suit. 
Your 
reasoning 
would 
be: 
“I 
have 
no 
idea 
how 
this 
culture 
would 
react 
to 
principled 
violations 
of 
the 
law; 
so 
I’d 
better 
not 
break 
it 
– 
I’d 
better 
be 
a 
stickler 
for 
it. 
I’m 
going 
to 
go 
by 
the 
book.”[32] 



Some 
of 
us 
may 
have 
the 
intuition 
that 
the 
judge 
in 
Henningsen 
was 
just 
applying 
the 
law, 
even 
though 
he 
was 
overriding 
the 
statutes. 
Dworkin’s 
argument 
relies 
on 
the 
validity 
of 
this 
intuition. 
But 
as 
we’ve 
just 
seen, 
if 
we 
keep 
the 
law 
the 
same, 
and 
vary 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
cultural 
background, 
our 
intuitions 
become 
very 
different. 
This 
suggests 
that 
the 
intuitions 
to 
which 
Dworkin 
is 
appealing 
are 
not 
hewed 
to 
the 
narrowly 
legal 
realities, 
but 
to 
extra-legal 
cultural 
realities. 


§ 
But 
there 
is 
a 
much 
graver 
problem 
with 
Dworkin’s 
analysis. 
The 
traditional 
picture 
is 
this. 
In 
some 
cases, 
the 
rules 
are 
silent. 
Such 
cases 
go 
to 
a 
judge. 
The 
judge 
makes 
a 
decision. 
His 
decision 
represents 
an 
interpretation 
of 
the 
law. 
The 
judge 
is 
not 
making 
up 
new 
law. 
This 
is 
the 
picture 
that 
Dworkin 
is 
defending. 
I 
would 
like 
to 
argue 
against 
it. 


Let 
us 
start 
with 
a 
truism: 
what 
is 
legal 
is 
what 
is 
permitted 
by 
the 
law, 
and 
what 
is 
illegal 
is 
what 
is 
forbidden 
by 
the 
law. 
Given 
this, 
suppose 
that 
the 
judge 
in 
Riggs 
had 
decided 
that 
the 
young 
man 
was 
entitled 
to 
the 
money. 
In 
that 
case, 
anyone 
carrying 
out 
the 
judge’s 
decision 
would 
have 
been 
acting 
legally. 
It 
would 
have 
been 
legal 
for 
the 
bank 
manager 
to 
open 
the 
safe-
deposit 
for 
the 
young-man; 
and 
it 
would 
have 
been 
illegal 
for 
embittered 
police 
officers 
and 
indignant 
relatives 
of 
the 
deceased 
to 
prevent 
the 
young 
man 
from 
claiming 
his 
fortune. 


Now 
suppose 
the 
judge 
had 
decided 
that 
Riggs 
was 
not 
entitled 
to 
the 
money. 
In 
that 
case, 
it 
would 
have 
been 
illegal 
for 
the 
bank-manager 
to 
open 
the 
safe-deposit 
box 
for 
the 
young 
man; 
and 
it 
would 
have 
been 
legal 
for 
the 
police 
to 
prevent 
the 
young 
man 
from 
attempting 
to 
open 
the 
safe-deposit 
box. 


If 
the 
judge 
really 
had 
been 
interpreting 
the 
law, 
then 
one 
possible 
decision 
on 
his 
part 
would 
have 
resulted 
in 
an 
avalanche 
of 
illegal 
activity 
– 



of 
people 
allowing 
the 
young 
man 
to 
have 
access 
to 
money 
which 
was 
not 
his, 
or 
of 
people 
depriving 
the 
young 
man 
of 
money 
which 
was 
his. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
how 
it 
works. 
It 
doesn’t 
matter 
what 
the 
judge 
decided: 
anyone 
carrying 
out 
the 
judge’s 
decision 
was 
ipso 
facto 
acting 
legally, 
and 
anyone 
defying 
it 
was 
ipso 
facto 
acting 
illegally. 
If 
the 
judge 
decides 
that 
Smith 
is 
entitled 
to 
the 
money, 
then 
it 
is 
illegal 
for 
law 
enforcement 
personnel, 
and 
by 
extension 
the 
general 
public, 
not 
to 
abide 
by 
that 
decision. 
If 
the 
judge 
decides 
that 
Smith 
is 
not 
entitled 
to 
the 
money, 
then 
it 
is 
illegal 
for 
law 
enforcement 
personnel, 
and 
by 
extension 
the 
general 
public, 
not 
to 
abide 
by 
that 
decision. 
So 
what 
can 
legally 
be 
done 
by 
law 
enforcement 
personnel, 
and 
by 
extension 
the 
general 
public, 
is 
determined 
by 
the 
judge’s 
ruling. 


Suppose 
a 
bailiff 
or 
sheriff’s 
deputy 
says 
the 
following 
to 
a 
judge 
who 
has 
just 
decided 
some 
case 
where 
the 
rules 
are 
silent: 


“I 
appreciate 
the 
sincere 
effort 
you 
have 
made 
to 
interpret 
the 
law. 
Unfortunately, 
you 
misinterpreted 
it. 
You 
see, 
contrary 
to 
what 
you 
said, 
the 
law 
requires 
such 
and 
such. 
Therefore, 
I 
am 
not 
going 
to 
abide 
by 
your 
ruling, 
and 
will 
regard 
as 
a 
law-breaker 
anyone 
who 
tries 
to 
stop 
me.” 


Such 
a 
display 
would 
be 
ludicrous. 
But 
far 
from 
being 
ludicrous, 
such 
behavior 
would 
often 
be 
de 
rigueur 
if 
judges 
interpreted, 
and 
did 
not 
create, 
the 
law. 
If 
judges 
are 
really 
interpreting 
the 
law, 
then 
they 
are 
attempting 
to 
identify 
what 
the 
law 
already 
demands 
and, 
therewith, 
what 
legal 
obligations 
people 
already 
have. 
An 
erroneous 
decision 
would 
misidentify 
those 
legal 
obligations: 
it 
would 
misidentify 
the 
legal 
obligations 
of 
law 
enforcement 
personnel 
(including 
the 
bailiff) 
and, 
by 
extension, 
of 
every 
civilian. 
In 
that 



case, 
unless 
the 
judges 
in 
this 
country 
happen 
to 
be 
superhumanly 
incapable 
of 
error, 
it 
would 
often 
be 
illegal 
for 
a 
bailiff 
not 
to 
defy 
the 
judge’s 
ruling. 
But 
no 
matter 
what 
the 
judge 
decides, 
the 
legal 
obligations 
of 
bailiffs 
and 
law 
enforcement 
personnel, 
and 
consequently 
of 
the 
general 
public, 
line 
up 
with 
that 
decision. 
Legality, 
and 
therefore 
the 
law, 
necessarily 
mould 
themselves 
around 
the 
judge’s 
decision. 
This 
entails 
that 
the 
judge’s 
decision 
creates, 
and 
does 
not 
identify, 
the 
law. 
The 
positivist 
is 
victorious. 


How 
is 
an 
anti-positivist 
to 
deal 
with 
this? 
There 
are 
a 
couple 
of 
paths 
he 
can 
take. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
completeness, 
I 
am 
going 
to 
consider 
all 
the 
possible 
options, 
not 
just 
those 
that 
an 
anti-positivist 
would 
seriously 
consider 
taking. 


Henceforth, 
the 
words 
of 
an 
imaginary 
anti-positivist 
interlocutor 
will 
be 
put 
in 
bold-face. 
This 
will 
eliminate 
the 
tedious 
locutions 
associated 
with 
indirect 
discourse 
(e.g. 
“it 
might 
be 
said 
that…”, 
“in 
response 
one 
might 
say…”). 
Let 
us 
now 
consider 
what 
an 
anti-positivist 
might 
say: 


Suppose 
the 
judge 
makes 
the 
wrong 
decision. 
I 
grant 
that 
the 
acts 
of 
those 
carrying 
out 
his 
decision 
are 
not 
illegal. 
But 
that 
is 
because 
the 
judge’s 
decision, 
though 
wrong, 
made 
those 
various 
acts 
legal. 
So 
relative 
to 
the 
law 
prior 
to 
the 
judge’s 
decision, 
they 
were 
illegal. 
But 
relative 
to 
the 
law 
after 
the 
judge’s 
decision, 
they 
were 
legal. 


But 
that 
is 
exactly 
what 
a 
positivist 
would 
say. 
The 
positivist 
says: 
the 
judge’s 
ruling 
creates 
law. 
The 
anti-positivist 
says: 
the 
judge’s 
ruling 
exposes 
existing 
law. 
According 
to 
the 
passage 
just 
considered, 
the 
judge 
creates 
law. 


Remember 
Euthyphro’s 
question: 
Is 
an 
act 
pious 
because 
the 
gods 
like 
it, 



or 
do 
they 
like 
it 
because 
it 
is 
pious? 
Does 
the 
judge 
choose 
a 
certain 
decision 
because 
it 
is 
legal, 
or 
is 
that 
decision 
legal 
because 
he 
chooses 
it? 
The 
passage 
just 
considered 
says: 
it’s 
legal 
because 
he 
chooses 
it. 
That 
is 
legal 
positivism. 
So 
the 
anti-positivist 
couldn’t 
(and 
wouldn’t) 
take 
that 
line 
of 
thought.[33] 
Let 
us 
move 
on. 


Suppose 
the 
judge 
makes 
the 
wrong 
decision. 
So 
suppose 
that, 
in 
actuality, 
the 
law 
entitles 
the 
young 
man 
to 
the 
money, 
but 
that 
the 
judge 
wrongly 
rules 
otherwise. 
In 
that 
case, 
the 
police 
officers, 
bank-personnel, 
and 
so 
on, 
who 
were 
carrying 
out 
the 
judge’s 
decision 
were 
in 
fact 
acting 
against 
the 
law. 
The 
police 
officers 
preventing 
the 
young 
man 
from 
claiming 
the 
money 
were 
acting 
against 
the 
law. 


But 
they 
were 
also 
acting 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
law. 
A 
given 
act 
can 
be 
legal 
in 
one 
respect 
and 
illegal 
in 
another. 
Relative 
to 
one 
set 
of 
laws 
(those 
relating 
to 
inheritance), 
the 
police 
were 
acting 
illegally. 
But 
relative 
to 
a 
different 
set 
of 
laws 
(those 
relating 
to 
disobeying 
judges), 
the 
police 
were 
acting 
legally. 
So, 
technically, 
the 
police 
who 
stood 
between 
the 
young 
man 
and 
the 
safety 
deposit 
box 
were 
acting 
illegally. 
But 
they 
were 
also 
acting 
legally. 


There 
is 
no 
contradiction 
in 
this. 
A 
comparison 
may 
help 
illuminate 
the 
principle 
involved. 
An 
act 
can 
be 
moral 
in 
some 
respects 
and 
immoral 
in 
others. 
It 
is 
a 
moral 
law, 
presumably, 
that 
one 
must 
keep 
one’s 
promises.[34] 
Suppose 
I 
make 
a 
promise 
to 
a 
Mafia 
don 
to 
kill 
a 
totally 
innocent 
person 
named 
Smith. 
If 
I 
abstain 
from 
killing 
Smith, 
I 
am 
breaking 
my 
promise, 
and 
thus 
acting 
immorally. 
But 
I 
am 
also 
acting 
morally; 
for 
it 
is 
a 
moral 
law 
that 
one 
mustn’t 
kill 
innocent 
people. 
Similarly, 
the 
police 
officers 
are 
acting 
legally 
relative 
to 
one 
set 



of 
laws, 
and 
illegally 
relative 
to 
another. 


Actually, 
the 
comparison 
can 
be 
taken 
further. 
Ultimately, 
the 
right 
thing 
to 
do 
is 
to 
abstain 
from 
killing 
Smith. 
But 
that 
doesn’t 
mean 
that 
I 
am 
totally 
absolved 
from 
having 
to 
keep 
my 
promise. 
Moral 
laws 
don’t 
cancel 
each 
other; 
they 
simply 
outweigh 
each 
other. 
It 
is 
still 
bad 
of 
me 
to 
break 
my 
promise. 
But 
it 
would 
be 
much 
worse 
to 
kill 
Smith. 
So 
on 
balance 
it 
is 
moral 
to 
not 
kill 
Smith 
– 
even 
though, 
in 
not 
killing 
him, 
I 
am 
acting 
both 
morally 
and 
immorally. 


For 
a 
similar 
reason, 
it 
is 
on 
balance 
legal 
for 
the 
police 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
judge’s 
instructions. 
Like 
moral 
principles, 
laws 
have 
weight. 
And 
if 
one’s 
acts 
are 
on 
balance 
to 
be 
legal, 
one 
must 
act 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
law 
that 
has 
the 
most 
weight. 


This 
is 
not 
a 
position 
that 
an 
anti-positivist 
could 
(or 
would) 
take. 
The 
concept 
of 
legality 
is 
binary. 
It 
makes 
no 
sense 
to 
say 
that 
“on 
balance” 
an 
act 
is 
legal. 
It 
is 
either 
legal 
or 
it 
isn’t. 
If 
a 
legal 
system 
characterizes 
a 
given 
act 
as 
both 
legal 
and 
illegal, 
then 
that 
system 
is 
simply 
incoherent. 
The 
idea 
that 
legality 
comes 
in 
degrees, 
or 
that 
some 
laws 
outweigh 
others, 
is 
a 
non-starter. 


Of 
course, 
some 
laws 
are 
more 
important 
than 
others, 
and 
this 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
different 
crimes 
are 
given 
different 
punishments. 
The 
law 
prohibiting 
murder 
is 
very 
important; 
that 
is 
why 
the 
penalty 
for 
breaking 
it 
is 
so 
severe. 
The 
law 
prohibiting 
littering 
is 
less 
important; 
that 
is 
why 
the 
penalty 
for 
breaking 
it 
is 
less 
severe. 
But 
both 
littering 
and 
murder 
are 
100% 
illegal. 
So 
the 
conception 
of 
legality 
put 
forth 
in 
the 
passage 
above 
is 
not 
viable.[35] 


To 
fix 
our 
ideas, 
suppose 
that 
the 
young 
man 
is 
entitled 
to 
the 



money, 
but 
that 
the 
judge 
wrongly 
rules 
otherwise. 
It 
doesn’t 
follow 
that 
the 
police 
officers 
carrying 
out 
the 
judge’s 
orders 
are 
acting 
illegally. 
You 
see, 
every 
law 
is 
hedged 
with 
implicit 
exception-clauses. 
For 
example, 
as 
a 
citizen, 
you 
are 
entitled 
to 
vote. 
But 
that 
privilege 
is 
suspended 
if 
you 
are 
waving 
a 
gun 
around 
when 
you 
show 
up 
at 
the 
polling 
station. 
In 
Riggs, 
the 
young 
man 
was 
entitled 
to 
the 
money. 
But 
that 
doesn’t 
mean 
that 
he 
can 
claim 
it 
no 
matter 
what. 
If 
he 
drives 
his 
car 
through 
the 
front 
door 
of 
the 
bank, 
he 
cannot 
claim 
it 
(at 
least 
not 
that 
minute). 
If 
he 
refuses 
to 
sign 
the 
relevant 
paper-work, 
he 
cannot 
claim 
it. 
Similarly, 
if 
a 
judge 
rules 
that 
he 
cannot 
claim 
it, 
then 
he 
cannot 
claim 
it. 
So 
everyone 
who 
was 
carrying 
out 
the 
judge’s 
orders 
was 
acting 
legally: 
their 
actions 
fell 
under 
one 
of 
the 
exception-clauses 
hedging 
the 
law 
entitling 
the 
young 
man 
to 
the 
money. 
What’s 
the 
problem 
here? 


The 
position 
described 
amounts 
to 
this: 
laws 
hold 
– 
except 
when 
judges 
decide 
they 
don’t. 
You’re 
entitled 
to 
the 
money 
– 
unless 
the 
judge 
decides 
otherwise. 
It 
is 
legal 
to 
do 
X 
so 
long 
as 
the 
judge 
says 
it 
is; 
otherwise, 
it 
isn’t. 
But 
that 
is 
hardcore 
positivism: 
the 
law 
is 
what 
the 
judge 
says. 
Let 
us 
move 
on. 


Suppose 
that 
the 
judge 
makes 
the 
wrong 
decision: 
he 
decides 
to 
let 
Smith 
go 
free 
when, 
in 
fact, 
the 
law 
requires 
that 
Smith 
be 
jailed. 
You 
are 
right, 
of 
course, 
that 
the 
narrowly 
legal 
realities 
are 
created, 
not 
revealed, 
by 
the 
judge’s 
decision. 
But, 
contrary 
to 
what 
you 
say, 
it 
doesn’t 
follow 
that 
the 
judge 
created 
the 
law. 
A 
later 
judge 
may 
overturn 
the 
first 
judge’s 
decision, 
thereby 
bringing 
the 
legal 
realities 
into 



alignment 
with 
the 
law. 
The 
law 
is 
sometimes 
down, 
but 
never 
out. 
An 
inept 
judge 
may 
give 
legal 
reality 
temporary 
dominance 
over 
the 
law. 
But, 
sooner 
or 
later, 
the 
law 
bounces 
back. 
The 
falsity 
of 
the 
first 
judge’s 
decision 
is 
revealed 
by 
the 
transient 
nature 
of 
the 
legal 
realities 
it 
created. 


This 
position 
doesn’t 
help 
the 
anti-positivist 
at 
all. 
The 
first 
judge’s 
decision 
determines 
the 
legal 
realities, 
at 
least 
for 
the 
time 
being. 
A 
second 
judge’s 
decision 
may 
create 
new 
legal 
realities. 
But 
this 
only 
confirms 
the 
positivist’s 
point: 
legal 
reality 
is 
created, 
not 
revealed, 
by 
judicial 
decisions. 


There 
is 
no 
denying 
that, 
at 
any 
given 
time, 
legal 
reality 
– 
what 
is 
legal 
and 
what 
is 
not 
--is 
determined 
by 
the 
rules 
and 
the 
rulings. 
These 
rules 
and 
rulings 
may 
be 
jettisoned 
later, 
but 
only 
by 
a 
fresh 
rule 
or 
ruling. 
So, 
at 
any 
given 
time, 
the 
law 
is 
a 
nullity 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
it 
diverges 
from 
legal 
reality 
and, 
therefore, 
from 
the 
rules 
and 
rulings. 


You 
don’t 
say 
that 
someone 
is 
ugly 
if 
he 
has 
a 
sour 
expression 
for 
one 
second, 
or 
that 
somebody 
is 
stupid 
if 
he 
makes 
one 
thoughtless 
comment. 
Beauty 
and 
intelligence 
are 
four-dimensional 
properties. 
They 
are 
properties 
not 
of 
instantaneous 
states 
of 
affairs, 
but 
of 
ongoing 
processes. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
the 
law. 
You 
don’t 
say 
that 
the 
law 
is 
defined 
by 
every 
spasm 
of 
judicial 
misconduct. 
Legal 
reality 
is 
only 
an 
expression 
of 
the 
law, 
and 
is 
not 
identical 
with 
it. 
Just 
as 
a 
person’s 
comments 
may 
not 
always 
express 
his 
true 
intellectual 
capacity, 
so 
the 
legal 
realities 
needn’t 
always 
express 
the 
true 
nature 
of 
the 
law. 
In 
the 
instant, 
legality 
may 
diverge 
from 
the 
law. 
But 
in 
the 
arena 
of 
the 
four-dimensional, 
they 
tend 
to 
coalesce. 
The 
legal 
realities 
created 
by 
erroneous 
decisions 
tend 
to 
meet 
a 
fitting 
end 
on 
the 
slaughter-bench 
of 
legal 
history.[36] 



There 
are 
two 
ways 
to 
interpret 
this. 
We 
can 
say 
that 
long-term 
patterns 
of 
judicial 
activity 
tend 
to 
be 
better 
expressions 
of 
the 
law 
than 
isolated 
judicial 
incidents 
(just 
as, 
where 
individuals 
are 
concerned, 
long 
term 
behavior 
patterns 
are 
a 
better 
indicator 
of 
intelligence 
than 
are 
isolated 
behaviors). 
Or 
we 
can 
we 
say 
that 
the 
law 
is 
a 
long-term 
pattern 
of 
judicial 
activity. 


Let 
us 
consider 
each 
possibility. 
Suppose 
that 
the 
law 
is 
a 
long-term 
pattern 
of 
activity. 
Long 
term 
patterns 
of 
judicial 
activity 
are 
constituted 
by 
the 
decisions 
that 
judges 
and 
juries 
make, 
along 
with 
the 
legal 
realities 
they 
define. 
If 
the 
law 
is 
a 
four-dimensional 
object, 
then 
its 
nature 
is 
fixed 
by 
momentary 
legal 
realities. 
They 
alone 
are 
what 
is 
operative 
in 
the 
here 
and 
now. 
The 
law 
ends 
up 
being 
epiphenomenal 
on 
these 
momentary 
legal 
realities. 


Further, 
if 
we 
think 
of 
the 
law 
in 
this 
way, 
then 
whether 
a 
judicial 
decision 
is 
right 
or 
wrong 
depends 
on 
how 
consistent 
it 
is 
with 
other 
events: 
even 
the 
most 
atrocious 
decision 
can 
be 
historically 
vindicated, 
provided 
that 
events 
down 
the 
line 
are 
correspondingly 
atrocious. 
This 
is 
a 
form 
of 
legal 
nihilism: 
anything 
goes, 
provided 
that 
history 
plays 
along. 
This 
is 
the 
opposite 
of 
anti-positivism. 


Let 
us 
now 
consider 
the 
other 
interpretation: 
long-term 
patterns 
of 
judicial 
activity 
express 
the 
law 
but 
do 
not 
constitute 
it. 
Just 
as 
the 
long-term 
behavior 
patterns 
of 
a 
person 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
consistent 
with 
her 
character 
than 
any 
one 
act, 
so 
long-term 
patterns 
of 
judicial 
activity 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
consistent 
with 
the 
real 
nature 
of 
the 
law. 
But 
just 
as 
a 
medical 
condition 
(e.g. 
Parkinson’s 
or 
chronic 
fatigue 
syndrome) 
may 
prevent 
an 
intelligent 
person 
from 
ever 
expressing 
her 
intelligence 
in 
its 
fullness, 
so 



contingences 
(e.g. 
evil 
judges, 
incompetent 
attorneys) 
may 
minimize 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
the 
true 
character 
of 
the 
law 
is 
expressed 
in 
long 
term 
patterns 
of 
judicial 
activity. 


If 
that 
is 
right, 
then 
legality 
may 
diverge 
practically 
without 
limit 
from 
the 
law. 
It 
may 
be 
illegal 
for 
a 
slave 
to 
leave 
the 
plantation: 
but 
the 
law 
permits 
it 
– 
nay, 
the 
law 
forbids 
the 
plantation-owner 
from 
having 
slaves 
to 
begin 
with. 
The 
problem 
is 
that 
legal 
reality 
fails 
to 
express 
the 
true 
nature 
of 
the 
law. 
It 
may 
be 
illegal 
for 
women 
to 
vote. 
But 
it 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
law 
to 
prohibit 
women 
from 
voting. 
Again, 
legal 
reality 
fails 
to 
express 
the 
true 
nature 
of 
the 
law. 


Suppose 
this 
is 
right. 
In 
that 
case, 
what 
do 
we 
mean 
by 
the 
law? 
It 
is 
always 
an 
empirical 
question 
what 
kind 
of 
law 
there 
is 
in 
a 
certain 
society. 
If 
X 
is 
illegal 
in 
society 
S, 
that 
fact 
is, 
at 
the 
very 
least, 
extremely 
strong 
evidence 
that 
X 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
law 
in 
S. 
If 
X 
is 
legal 
in 
S, 
that 
is, 
at 
the 
very 
least, 
extremely 
strong 
evidence 
that 
X 
is 
not 
contrary 
to 
the 
law 
in 
S. 
The 
anti-positivist 
must 
say 
that 
the 
legal 
realities 
are 
merely 
evidence 
of 
the 
true 
character 
of 
law 
– 
and 
just 
as 
clues 
found 
at 
a 
crime-scene 
can 
be 
grossly 
misleading 
as 
to 
the 
identity 
of 
the 
killer, 
so 
facts 
about 
legality 
can 
be 
grossly 
misleading 
as 
to 
the 
true 
nature 
of 
the 
law 
in 
S. 


This 
move 
is 
less 
than 
entirely 
satisfying. 
I 
understand 
perfectly 
how 
the 
killer 
might 
plant 
evidence 
that 
incriminates 
someone 
else. 
Killing 
is 
one 
thing; 
depositing 
hair 
or 
clothing 
at 
the 
scene 
of 
the 
crime 
is 
something 
else. 
The 
reality 
is 
one 
thing; 
the 
information 
through 
which 
we 
learn 
about 
it 
is 
something 
else.[37] 
This 
ontological 
fact 
corresponds 
to 
the 
epistemological 
fact 
that 
evidence 
is 
typically 
defeasible. 
We 
can 
imagine 
finding 
new 
evidence 
(e.g. 
a 
video-recording 
of 
Jones 
committing 
the 
crime) 
that 
trumps 
the 
evidence 
we 
previously 
found 
incriminating 
Smith. 
But 
facts 
about 
legality 
are 
not 
comparably 
defeasible. 
If 
insider 
trading 
is 
illegal 
on 



Monday, 
and 
legal 
on 
Tuesday, 
it 
is 
very 
hard 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
change 
was 
a 
purely 
evidential 
one. 
Surely 
the 
law 
changed. 


§ 
Let 
us 
distill 
the 
points 
just 
made. 
When 
we 
describe 
an 
act 
as 
being 
“against 
the 
law”, 
we 
mean 
that 
it 
fails 
to 
comply 
with 
some 
standard 
or 
falls 
short 
of 
some 
norm. 
But 
in 
some 
cases, 
“the 
law” 
has 
a 
non-normative 
meaning; 
it 
denotes 
the 
legal 
process. 
In 
the 
statement: 
“the 
law 
operates 
slowly 
but 
surely”, 
the 
expression 
“the 
law” 
denotes 
something 
which 
happens; 
it 
denotes 
judicial 
activity, 
not 
a 
norm 
in 
terms 
of 
which 
such 
activity 
is 
to 
be 
evaluated. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
statements 
like 
“I’m 
going 
to 
put 
my 
faith 
in 
the 
law” 
and 
“the 
law 
is 
easily 
manipulated.” 
Nobody 
puts 
their 
faith 
in 
a 
set 
of 
norms: 
they 
put 
their 
faith 
in 
the 
judicial 
processes 
that 
are 
supposed 
to 
realize 
those 
norms. 
A 
set 
of 
norms 
cannot 
be 
manipulated: 
what 
can 
be 
manipulated 
are 
the 
human 
processes 
that 
are 
meant 
to 
realize 
those 
norms. 


The 
debate 
between 
the 
positivist 
and 
the 
anti-positivist 
must 
be 
understood 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
normative 
meaning 
of 
the 
expression 
“the 
law.” 
If 
we 
take 
“the 
law” 
to 
denote 
judicial 
activity, 
then 
every 
judicial 
decision, 
no 
matter 
how 
absurd, 
is 
automatically 
a 
part 
of 
“the 
law.” 
But 
this 
is 
specifically 
what 
the 
anti-positivist 
rejects; 
the 
anti-positivist 
says 
that 
a 
judicial 
decision 
can 
fall 
sadly 
short 
of 
what 
the 
law 
actually 
requires. 
So 
when 
the 
anti-positivist 
talks 
about 
“the 
law”, 
he 
must 
have 
the 
normative 
meaning 
of 
that 
expression 
in 
mind. 


The 
judges 
in 
Riggs 
and 
Henningsen 
did 
indeed 
base 
their 
decisions 
on 
principles. 
But 
this 
only 
shows 
that 
principles 
have 
a 
role 
in 
judicial 
activity; 
it 
doesn’t 
show 
that 
they 
are 
part 
of 
the 
law 
in 
the 
normative 
sense. 
The 
positivist 
will 
happily 
admit 
that 
principles 
are 
involved 
in 
judicial 
activity. 
What 
the 
positivist 
denies 
is 
that 
principles 
can 
be 
a 
part 
of 
“the 
law” 
in 
the 



normative 
sense 
without 
being 
incorporated 
into 
rules. 
Let 
us 
move 
on. 


In 
a 
baseball 
game, 
everybody 
abides 
by 
the 
umpire’s 
ruling. 
But 
it 
doesn’t 
follow 
that 
the 
umpire 
himself 
makes 
a 
given 
pitch 
be 
a 
strike 
or 
a 
ball. 
The 
reality 
is 
independent 
of 
what 
the 
umpire 
decides. 
The 
ball 
either 
was, 
or 
was 
not, 
inside 
the 
strike-zone. 


At 
the 
same 
time, 
somebody 
has 
to 
have 
the 
final 
word 
– 
otherwise 
every 
baseball 
game 
would 
disintegrate 
into 
anarchy. 
So 
even 
though 
the 
umpire’s 
ruling 
determines 
whether 
for 
all 
intents 
and 
purposes 
the 
pitch 
was 
in 
the 
strike 
zone 
or 
not, 
there 
is 
still 
an 
independent 
reality. 
Further, 
even 
though 
the 
umpire 
can 
be 
in 
error 
in 
any 
given 
case, 
he 
cannot 
generally 
be 
in 
error. 
If 
his 
decisions 
are 
patently 
false 
on 
a 
regular 
basis, 
he 
will 
be 
dismissed. 


Something 
exactly 
analogous 
holds 
with 
respect 
to 
judicial 
decisions. 
Obviously 
judges 
make 
mistakes. 
But 
the 
buck 
has 
to 
stop 
somewhere. 
Otherwise 
there 
would 
be 
anarchy, 
as 
every 
civil 
dispute 
would 
lead 
to 
mayhem. 
So 
the 
judge’s 
decision 
defines 
what 
the 
law 
is 
for 
all 
intents 
and 
purposes 
– 
just 
as 
for 
all 
intents 
and 
purposes 
an 
umpire’s 
call 
defines 
whether 
a 
pitch 
was 
a 
strike 
or 
a 
ball. 
This 
allows 
a 
judge 
to 
be 
wrong 
on 
any 
given 
occasion. 
But 
the 
judge 
cannot 
generally 
be 
wrong. 
If 
a 
judge’s 
decisions 
are 
patently 
false 
on 
a 
regular 
basis, 
then 
he 
will 
be 
dismissed, 
for 
the 
same 
reasons 
as 
a 
habitually 
incompetent 
umpire. 
So 
the 
over-all 
pattern 
of 
a 
judge’s 
decisions 
is 
necessarily 
consistent 
with 
the 
real 
nature 
of 
the 
law, 
even 
though 
any 
given 
decision 
may 
deviate 
from 
it. 


Legality 
is 
what 
the 
law 
is 
for 
all 
intents 
and 
purposes. 
The 
umpire’s 
decision 
defines 
the 
status 
of 
the 
pitch 
for 
all 
intents 
and 
purposes, 
even 
though 
a 
given 
call 
isn’t 
necessarily 
true 
to 
the 
actual 
nature 
of 
the 
pitch. 
Similarly, 
the 
judge’s 
decision 
defines 
the 
status 
of 
the 
law 
for 
all 
intents 



and 
purposes, 
even 
though 
any 
given 
decision 
may 
not 
be 
true 
to 
the 
actual 
nature 
of 
the 
law. 
Thus 
it 
is 
no 
more 
absurd 
to 
distinguish 
legality 
from 
the 
law 
than 
it 
is 
to 
distinguish 
an 
umpire’s 
decision 
regarding 
a 
pitch 
from 
the 
pitch 
itself. 


There 
is 
a 
very 
clear 
distinction 
between 
the 
actual 
trajectory 
of 
the 
ball 
and 
what 
the 
umpire 
says 
the 
trajectory 
was. 
Anyone 
(who 
is 
suitably 
placed) 
can 
see 
the 
pitch 
with 
his 
own 
eyes. 
So 
anyone 
can 
compare 
the 
umpire’s 
call 
with 
the 
corresponding 
reality. 


A 
related 
point 
is 
that 
the 
reality 
doesn’t 
mould 
itself 
to 
the 
umpire’s 
calls. 
Even 
if 
the 
umpire 
is 
wrong 
all 
the 
time, 
that 
has 
no 
effect 
on 
where 
the 
ball 
actually 
goes, 
and 
(leaving 
aside 
easily 
removed 
accidental 
facts) 
it 
has 
little 
or 
no 
effect 
on 
where 
anybody 
thinks 
the 
ball 
goes. 


In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
law, 
the 
reality 
does 
mould 
itself 
to 
the 
decisions 
that 
judges 
make. 
Suppose 
that 
a 
series 
of 
judges 
were 
to 
rule 
that 
those 
of 
middle-eastern 
descent 
could 
not 
own 
land. 
Whatever 
the 
law 
was 
before 
these 
rulings 
were 
made, 
the 
law 
would 
certainly 
come 
to 
fit 
these 
rulings: 
it 
would 
become 
illegal 
for 
middle-easterners 
to 
own 
land, 
even 
if 
it 
wasn’t 
before. 


Our 
own 
history 
illustrates 
this 
point. 
When 
judges 
ruled 
that 
segregation 
was 
Constitutional, 
segregation 
was 
permitted 
by 
the 
law. 
When 
they 
ruled 
that 
it 
was 
unconstitutional, 
it 
was 
forbidden 
by 
the 
law. 
It 
is 
an 
historical 
datum 
that 
the 
law 
moulds 
itself 
to 
judicial 
rulings. 


This 
is 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
law 
is 
a 
reality 
that 
transcends 
the 
rulings. 
For 
Berkeley, 
a 
physical 
object’s 
esse 
lies 
in 
its 
percipi. 
This 
is 
just 
a 
way 
of 
saying 
that 
there 
are 
no 
physical 
objects.[38] 
To 
take 
an 
anti-
realist 
view 
of 
X 
just 
is 
to 
say 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
X 
is 
a 
function 
of 
our 



representations 
of 
X.[39] 
Enough 
judicial 
misrepresentations 
of 
the 
law 
create 
a 
new 
law 
of 
which 
they 
are 
a 
correct 
representation. 
For 
purely 
metaphysical 
reasons, 
this 
makes 
it 
hard 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
law 
has 
any 
reality 
outside 
of 
judicial 
rulings. 


This 
makes 
it 
clear 
why 
the 
objector’s 
comparison 
is 
spurious. 
A 
series 
of 
bad 
calls 
on 
the 
part 
of 
an 
umpire 
doesn’t 
affect 
where 
the 
ball 
goes, 
or 
even 
(leaving 
aside 
facts 
easily 
idealized 
away 
from) 
where 
people 
think 
the 
ball 
goes. 
But 
a 
supposedly 
deviant 
judicial 
ruling 
becomes 
a 
correct 
one, 
provided 
that 
enough 
similar 
rulings 
follow 
it. 
If 
some 
crackpot 
judge 
rules 
that 
people 
of 
middle-eastern 
descent 
cannot 
own 
land, 
that 
ruling 
becomes 
the 
law, 
provided 
that 
enough 
similar 
rulings 
follow 
it. 


Suppose 
that 
today 
(Feb. 
13, 
2006), 
a 
judge 
were 
to 
make 
the 
barbaric 
ruling 
that 
those 
of 
middle-eastern 
descent 
couldn’t 
own 
land. 
It 
would 
be 
patently 
obvious 
to 
everyone 
(except 
a 
few 
bigots) 
that 
the 
ruling 
was 
contrary 
to 
the 
law 
(even 
if 
there 
were 
some 
narrowly 
statutory 
justification 
for 
it). 
This 
fact 
would 
be 
expressed, 
but 
not 
constituted, 
by 
that 
ruling’s 
being 
overturned 
by 
later 
judicial 
rulings. 


Here 
we 
must 
recall 
what 
we 
said 
earlier. 
Our 
intuitions 
about 
a 
given 
judicial 
decision 
often 
embody 
background 
knowledge 
about 
the 
culture. 
To 
ensure 
that 
our 
intuitions 
track 
the 
purely 
legal 
realities, 
and 
not 
extra-legal 
ethical 
and 
cultural 
realities, 
we 
must 
consider 
the 
same 
judicial 
decision 
while 
varying 
the 
cultural 
background. 


Given 
this, 
imagine 
a 
country 
– 
call 
it 
Acirema 
--where 
the 
same 
legal 
rules 
as 
ours 
are 
operative, 
but 
where 
the 
background 
mores 
are 
very 



different. 
There 
it 
is 
taken 
for 
granted 
that 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
xenophobia 
is 
a 
good 
– 
indeed, 
a 
necessary 
– 
thing. 
In 
Acirema, 
a 
crackpot 
judge 
rules 
that 
those 
of 
middle-eastern 
descent 
cannot 
own 
land. 
The 
judge’s 
ruling 
is 
upheld 
by 
later 
rulings. 
Consequently, 
the 
first 
ruling 
is 
solidified 
into 
law. 
Are 
we 
to 
say 
that, 
in 
Acirema, 
the 
judges 
all 
happen 
to 
be 
wrong 
about 
what 
the 
law 
is? 
Even 
if 
the 
initial 
judge 
was 
wrong, 
the 
law 
eventually 
moulds 
itself 
to 
his 
decision. 
But, 
for 
reasons 
we’ve 
discussed, 
this 
isn’t 
consistent 
with 
the 
idea 
that 
there 
is 
any 
reality 
(at 
least 
not 
any 
legal 
reality) 
relative 
to 
which 
that 
ruling 
was 
either 
true 
or 
false. 


§ 
These 
points 
can 
be 
illustrated 
with 
a 
chapter 
from 
our 
own 
history. 
In 
1900, 
it 
was 
illegal 
for 
women 
to 
vote. 
This 
is 
an 
empirical 
fact. 
If 
a 
woman 
tried 
to 
vote, 
she 
would 
have 
run 
into 
an 
impenetrable 
wall 
of 
statute 
and 
law 
enforcement. 
But 
if 
there 
are 
any 
principles 
at 
all 
in 
our 
legal 
system, 
we 
may 
be 
sure 
that 
all 
of 
them 
have 
always 
demanded 
that 
women 
have 
the 
right 
to 
vote. 
Nothing 
could 
be 
more 
undemocratic, 
and 
thus 
more 
contrary 
to 
the 
principles 
(if 
any 
there 
be) 
inherent 
in 
our 
legal 
system, 
than 
denying 
women 
the 
right 
to 
have 
a 
say 
in 
who 
the 
nation’s 
leaders 
will 
be. 
So 
if 
there 
was 
ever 
a 
case 
where 
legal 
realities 
clashed 
with 
principles 
inherent 
in 
the 
law, 
this 
was 
it. 


The 
positivist 
says 
that 
in 
1900 
it 
was 
against 
the 
law 
for 
women 
to 
vote. 
Period. 
Fortunately, 
those 
laws 
were 
later 
overturned. 
But 
that 
isn’t 
because 
the 
law 
finally 
managed 
to 
express 
itself; 
it 
isn’t 
because 
some 
principle 
buried 
deep 
within 
the 
law 
finally 
rose 
to 
the 
surface. 
It 
is 
because 
the 
law 
itself 
changed. 
The 
change 
consisted 
in 
some 
judge’s 
making 
a 
new 
ruling 
or 
in 
some 
legislature 
making 
a 
new 
rule. 


According 
to 
the 
anti-positivist, 
our 
legal 
system 
isn’t 
just 
a 
collection 
of 
rules: 
it 
also 
includes 
principles. 
As 
we 
just 
saw, 
if 
our 
legal 
system 
includes 



any 
principles, 
they 
have 
always 
demanded 
that 
women 
have 
the 
right 
to 
vote. 
So 
the 
anti-positivist 
must 
say 
that 
denying 
suffrage 
to 
women 
was 
contrary 
to 
the 
principles 
inherent 
in 
our 
legal 
system, 
and 
was 
thus 
in 
some 
sense 
contrary 
to 
the 
law. 
This 
would 
seem 
to 
mean 
that, 
all 
along, 
the 
law 
did 
allow 
women 
to 
vote. 
But 
this 
seems 
strange: 
it 
is 
an 
empirical 
fact 
that 
in 
1900 
it 
was 
illegal, 
and 
therefore 
contrary 
to 
the 
law, 
for 
women 
to 
vote. 
So 
the 
anti-positivist’s 
position 
is 
given 
by 
the 
self-contradictory 
and 
therefore 
false 
proposition 
that, 
even 
though 
it 
was 
illegal 
for 
women 
to 
vote 
in 
1900, 
the 
law 
nonetheless 
allowed 
them 
to. 


What 
does 
the 
anti-positivist 
say 
here? 
There 
are 
a 
couple 
of 
options. 
First, 
he 
could 
say 
that, 
deep 
down, 
it 
was 
in 
fact 
legal 
in 
1900 
for 
women 
to 
vote. 
But 
judges, 
police 
officers, 
and 
so 
on, 
didn’t 
know 
it: 
the 
relevant 
facts 
about 
the 
law 
were 
too 
far 
below 
the 
surface. 


But 
such 
a 
view 
would 
be 
far 
too 
revisionist 
to 
be 
taken 
seriously. 
Also, 
the 
term 
“deep 
down” 
seems 
not 
to 
apply 
to 
the 
concept 
of 
legality. 
As 
we’ve 
noted, 
something 
is 
either 
legal 
or 
it 
isn’t. 
The 
binary 
nature 
of 
legality 
doesn’t 
allow 
any 
place 
for 
the 
concept 
of 
a 
deep 
down. 
There 
is 
no 
deep 
down 
where 
everything 
is 
black 
or 
white. 
If 
we 
wish 
to 
say 
that 
deep 
down 
such 
and 
such 
is 
true 
of 
the 
law 
– 
e.g. 
that 
deep 
down 
U.S. 
law 
in 
1900 
did 
permit 
women 
to 
vote, 
even 
though 
they 
could 
not 
legally 
do 
so 
– 
then 
we 
must 
implausibly 
distinguish 
legality 
from 
the 
law. 


Let 
us 
move 
on 
(I 
remind 
the 
reader 
that 
bold-faced 
passages 
are 
those 
of 
an 
imaginary 
anti-positivist 
interlocutor). 


The 
law 
did 
indeed 
change. 
But 
that 
does 
nothing 
in 
the 
way 
of 
discrediting 
anti-positivism. 
You 
have 
tendentiously 
chosen 
a 
case 
where, 
under 
the 
banner 
of 
legal 
principle, 
judicial 
activity 
really 
did 
usurp 



existing 
law. 
But 
there 
are 
other 
cases 
where 
principle-based 
decisions 
are 
revelations, 
not 
usurpations, 
of 
existing 
law. 


By 
this 
reasoning, 
the 
great 
legal 
decisions 
that 
define 
U.S. 
jurisprudential 
history 
were 
cases 
of 
judges 
making 
up 
laws. 
It 
isn’t 
clear 
how, 
in 
any 
respect 
relevant 
to 
our 
inquiry, 
the 
changing 
of 
laws 
relating 
to 
suffrage 
are 
different 
from 
the 
changing 
of 
laws 
relating 
to 
slavery 
or 
abortion. 
If 
the 
objector 
is 
right, 
then 
it 
seems 
to 
follow 
that 
practically 
every 
significant 
decision 
made 
by 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
was 
a 
case 
of 
judicial 
usurpation 
of 
the 
law. 


This 
is 
not 
a 
sophistical 
use 
of 
slippery-slope 
reasoning. 
A 
slippery 
slope 
argument 
purports 
to 
show 
that, 
given 
certain 
apparently 
reasonable 
premises, 
cases 
we 
know 
to 
differ 
in 
a 
certain 
respect 
from 
a 
paradigm 
do 
not 
in 
fact 
so 
differ. 
A 
person 
with 
no 
hair 
at 
all 
is 
a 
paradigm 
of 
baldness. 
A 
slippery 
slope 
argument 
purports 
to 
show 
that 
a 
person 
with 
a 
full 
head 
of 
hair 
is 
also 
bald.[40] 
Nothing 
comparable 
to 
this 
is 
going 
on 
in 
the 
present 
case. 
I 
am 
not 
trying 
to 
prove 
that 
some 
judicial 
decision 
that 
differs 
from 
the 
paradigm 
does 
not 
so 
differ. 
Rather, 
I 
am 
discussing 
the 
paradigm 
itself. 
If 
there 
are 
any 
principles 
at 
all 
in 
our 
legal 
system, 
one 
of 
them 
is 
that 
citizens 
must 
be 
allowed 
to 
choose 
who 
their 
leaders 
are 
and 
must 
therefore 
be 
allowed 
to 
vote. 
If 
there 
was 
ever 
a 
paradigm 
case 
of 
a 
legal 
principle 
at 
work, 
it 
was 
the 
abolition 
(in 
the 
U.S.) 
of 
the 
laws 
prohibiting 
women 
from 
voting. 
When 
we 
look 
at 
that 
paradigm, 
what 
we 
find 
is 
that 
it 
involved 
a 
massive 
change 
in 
legal 
reality. 
So 
if 
the 
decision 
to 
give 
women 
the 
right 
to 
vote 
is 
a 
case 
of 
a 
principle 
inherent 
in 
our 
system 
of 
law 
finally 
managing 
to 
make 
itself 
heard 
– 
and 
that 
decision 
is 
such 
case, 
if 
anything 
is 
– 
then 
we 



must 
distinguish 
legal 
reality 
from 
the 
law. 
The 
law 
didn’t 
forbid 
women 
from 
voting: 
but 
it 
was 
still 
illegal 
for 
them 
to 
do 
so. 
But, 
as 
we’ve 
seen, 
it 
doesn’t 
appear 
possible 
to 
make 
this 
distinction. 


You’ve 
been 
talking 
a 
lot 
about 
empirical 
facts 
(“it 
is 
an 
empirical 
fact 
that 
women 
couldn’t 
vote 
in 
1900”). 
Well, 
here’s 
an 
empirical 
fact 
for 
you. 
The 
Constitution 
is 
the 
supreme 
law 
of 
the 
land. 
If 
you 
say 
otherwise, 
then 
you 
need 
to 
take 
a 
class 
on 
American 
government. 
The 
Constitution 
is 
not 
just 
a 
bunch 
of 
statutes: 
it 
is 
loaded 
with 
principles. 
You’ve 
mentioned 
a 
couple 
yourself. 
I 
gather 
you’ll 
say 
that 
the 
Constitution 
is 
not 
the 
law. 
But 
then 
who’s 
being 
absurdly 
revisionist 
now? 


I 
do 
not 
wish 
to 
advocate 
any 
kind 
of 
anti-realism 
or 
nihilism 
about 
the 
concept 
of 
Constitutionality. 
There 
are 
facts 
about 
what 
the 
principles 
in 
the 
Constitution 
require, 
and 
(I 
believe) 
those 
principles 
never 
did 
countenance 
atrocities 
like 
slavery.[41] 
But 
it 
is 
also 
a 
matter 
of 
empirical 
fact 
that 
slavery 
was 
legal. 
Given 
this 
fact, 
if 
we 
wish 
to 
maintain 
that 
the 
principles 
in 
the 
Constitution 
are 
a 
part 
of 
“the 
law”, 
then 
we 
must 
either 
distinguish 
legality 
from 
what 
is 
permitted 
by 
law 
– 
a 
move 
we 
have 
already 
seen 
to 
be 
a 
nonstarter 
– 
or 
we 
must 
distinguish 
different 
strata 
of 
legal 
reality: 
the 
surface 
legal 
realities 
permitted 
slavery, 
but 
deep 
down 
the 
law 
did 
not 
permit 
slavery. 


We’ve 
already 
seen 
the 
problem 
with 
this. 
There 
are 
no 
strata 
of 
legality. 
Something 
is 
either 
legal 
or 
it 
isn’t. 
If 
a 
legal 
system 
comprises 
contradictory 



rules, 
then 
it 
is 
ipso 
facto 
incoherent. 
U.S. 
law 
was 
evil, 
but 
not 
incoherent, 
in 
virtue 
of 
permitting 
slavery. 
So 
we 
cannot 
say 
that, 
while 
permitting 
slavery, 


U.S. 
law 
also 
prohibited 
it 
(on 
some 
deeper 
level). 
Here 
there 
is 
an 
obvious 
possible 
counter-move 
for 
the 
anti-positivist: 
Contrary 
to 
what 
you 
just 
said, 
U.S. 
law 
was 
incoherent 
in 
virtue 
of 
permitting 
slavery. 
In 
due 
course, 
certain 
political 
and 
judicial 
events 
removed 
that 
incoherence. 
Indeed, 
much 
legal 
progress 
consists 
in 
the 
removal 
of 
such 
incoherencies. 
To 
take 
another 
example, 
it 
has 
always 
been 
unconstitutional, 
and 
therefore 
illegal, 
to 
prohibit 
women 
from 
voting. 
But 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
the 
law 
did 
indeed 
prohibit 
it. 
Therefore, 
it 
was 
legal, 
and 
also 
illegal, 
for 
a 
woman 
to 
vote. 
Fortunately, 
that 
incoherence 
was 
eventually 
removed 
by 
some 
legislators 
and 
judges 
who 
were 
able 
to 
see 
into 
the 
depths 
of 
our 
legal 
system. 
In 
general, 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
is 
in 
the 
business 
of 
removing 
contradictions 
from 
our 
legal 
system.[42] 


The 
problem 
is 
that 
there 
isn’t 
any 
significant 
sense 
in 
which 
women 
could 
legally 
vote 
in 
1868. 
Even 
if 
there 
is 
such 
a 
sense, 
it 
is 
not 
remotely 
comparable 
to 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
they 
could 
not 
legally 
do 
so. 
Obviously 
two 
very 
different 
concepts 
are 
at 
work 
here. 
We 
would 
simply 
render 
the 
term 
“legal” 
ambiguous 
if 
we 
were 
to 
use 
it 
to 
mark 
both 
of 
them. 


It 
seems 
reasonable 
to 
suppose 
that 
the 
spirit, 
if 
not 
the 
letter, 
of 
the 
Constitution 
has 
never 
countenanced 
the 
denial 
of 
suffrage 
to 
women: 
the 
principles 
inherent 
in 
the 
Constitution 
are, 
I 
believe, 
inconsistent 
with 
something 
so 
obviously 
undemocratic. 
But 
it 
is 
also 
an 
empirical 
fact 
that 



women 
did 
not 
have 
the 
right 
to 
vote 
in 
1868. 
So 
if 
we 
are 
to 
say 
that 
the 
aforementioned 
principles 
have 
always 
been 
a 
part 
of 
American 
law, 
then 
we 
must 
distinguish 
the 
law 
from 
legality: 
it 
was 
illegal 
for 
women 
to 
vote, 
but 
it 
was 
against 
the 
law 
to 
deny 
them 
that 
right. 
But 
we 
have 
already 
seen 
that 
legality 
cannot 
be 
distinguished 
from 
the 
law. 
Hence, 
just 
as 
the 
positivist 
argues, 
those 
principles 
were 
not 
a 
part 
of 
the 
law 
– 
until 
(come 
1920[43]) 
they 
were 
incorporated 
into 
rules 
and 
rulings.[44] 


§ 
This 
gives 
us 
some 
insight 
into 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
obligation 
that 
judges 
have 
towards 
the 
principles 
in 
the 
Constitution. 
Judges 
do 
have 
an 
obligation 
to 
uphold 
those 
principles. 
But, 
as 
paradoxical 
as 
it 
may 
sound, 
the 
obligation 
in 
question 
is 
not 
of 
a 
strictly 
legal 
nature, 
as 
I 
would 
now 
like 
to 
argue. 


It 
makes 
no 
sense 
to 
say 
that 
the 
Constitution 
imposes 
a 
“legal 
obligation” 
on 
a 
judge 
to 
do 
X, 
but 
that 
the 
judge 
can 
legally 
not 
do 
X. 
Such 
a 
position 
would 
eviscerate 
the 
notions 
of 
legality 
and 
of 
legal 
obligation. 
Given 
this, 
suppose 
we 
say 
that 
the 
principles 
inherent 
in 
the 
Constitution 
imposed 
a 
legal 
obligation 
on 
judges 
(in 
the 
ante-bellum 
South) 
not 
to 
recognize 
slavery. 
In 
that 
case, 
any 
judge 
who 
upheld 
any 
law 
permitting 
slavery 
was 
acting 
illegally. 
By 
implication, 
the 
same 
is 
true 
of 
any 
member 
of 
law-enforcement 
and, 
by 
extension, 
any 
civilian 
who 
complied 
with 
any 
law 
permitting 
slavery. 


But 
there 
is 
no 
significant 
sense 
in 
which 
this 
was 
the 
case. 
Any 
member 
of 
law 
enforcement, 
and 
by 
implication 
any 
civilian, 
who 
defied 
those 
laws 
was 
acting 
illegally. 
(Somebody 
who 
tried 
to 
help 
slaves 
escape 
was 
acting 
illegally, 
just 
as 
in 
our 
time 
somebody 
stealing 
a 
car 
is 
acting 
illegally.) 
Anyone 
who 
abided 
by 
them 
was 
acting 
legally. 
(Somebody 
who 
did 
not 
assist 
a 
slave 
in 
his 
effort 
to 
escape 
was 
acting 
legally.) 
These 
are 
historical 
data. 
So 
if 
we 
say 
that 
the 
Constitution 
imposed 
a 
legal 
obligation 
on 
judges 



in 
the 
ante-bellum 
South 
to 
uphold 
laws 
permitting 
slavery, 
then 
we 
are 
falsely 
saying 
that 
there 
was 
some 
significant 
sense 
in 
which 
slavery 
was 
illegal. 
Thus, 
while 
U.S. 
judges 
probably 
do 
have 
an 
obligation 
to 
uphold 
the 
principles 
in 
the 
Constitution, 
that 
obligation 
is 
not 
of 
a 
legal 
nature. 
We 
must 
find 
some 
other 
way 
to 
understand 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
law, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
the 
principles 
inherent 
in 
the 
Constitution, 
on 
the 
other. 


It 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
plain 
historical 
fact 
that 
the 
presence 
of 
principles 
in 
the 
Constitution 
has 
given 
people 
freedoms 
that 
they 
otherwise 
would 
not 
have 
had. 
So 
the 
principles 
just 
discussed 
do 
have 
an 
important 
relationship 
to 
legal 
reality. 
But 
this 
doesn’t 
mean 
that 
those 
principles 
are 
already 
in 
the 
law. 
The 
relationship 
between 
the 
principle 
and 
the 
law 
is 
not 
one 
of 
identity, 
but 
of 
causality: 
the 
presence 
of 
principles 
in 
the 
Constitution 
causes 
judges 
to 
make 
rulings 
that 
they 
might 
otherwise 
not 
make.[45] 
As 
we 
saw 
a 
moment 
ago, 
if 
we 
say 
that 
those 
principles 
are 
already 
in 
the 
law 
– 
regardless 
of 
what 
judges 
and 
legislatures 
do 
– 
then 
we 
put 
ourselves 
in 
the 
absurd 
position 
of 
having 
to 
say 
that 
legal 
reality 
may 
not 
always 
coincide 
with 
the 
law. 


Is 
my 
analysis 
overly 
revisionist? 


I 
just 
argued 
that 
the 
U.S. 
Constitution 
is 
not 
part 
of 
U.S. 
law. 
As 
the 
objector 
said, 
this 
is 
likely 
to 
register 
with 
many 
as 
blatantly 
false 
and 
as 
thus 
warranting 
the 
rejection 
of 
my 
analysis. 


After 
putting 
forth 
my 
own 
positive 
analysis 
of 
law, 
we 
will 
find 
a 
way 
to 
deal 
with 
all 
of 
the 
data 
thus 
far 
considered. 
Right 
now, 
I 
can 
only 
make 
a 
few 
anticipatory 
remarks. 


First 
of 
all, 
we 
must 
at 
all 
costs 
hold 
onto 
the 
truth 
that 
what 
is 
legal 
is 
what 
is 
permitted 
by 
law 
and 
that 
what 
is 
illegal 
is 
what 
is 
forbidden 
by 
law. 



As 
we’ve 
seen, 
Fuller’s 
analysis 
is 
inconsistent 
with 
this 
and 
must 
therefore 
be 
rejected. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
I 
do 
admit 
that, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
my 
analysis 
requires 
that 
I 
deny 
the 
Constitution 
a 
place 
in 
the 
structure 
of 
U.S. 
law, 
that 
redounds 
to 
the 
discredit 
of 
my 
analysis 
(even 
though, 
I 
have 
argued, 
it 
does 
not, 
strictly 
speaking, 
warrant 
its 
rejection). 
Let 
me 
now 
outline 
how 
my 
analysis 
of 
law 
will 
satisfy 
these 
desiderata. 


I 
will 
argue 
that 
laws 
are 
governmental 
assurances 
of 
protections 
of 
rights. 
(Neither 
this 
contention, 
nor 
any 
of 
my 
arguments 
for 
it, 
presuppose 
the 
truth 
of 
any 
of 
the 
anti-Dworkin 
or 
anti-Fuller 
points 
I 
have 
made 
so 
far; 
indeed, 
my 
arguments 
for 
it 
are, 
ultimately, 
Dworkin-and 
Fuller-friendly. 
So 
no 
questions 
will 
have 
been 
begged, 
at 
least 
not 
against 
those 
two 
scholars.) 
Further, 
I 
will 
argue 
that 
judicial 
“interpretations” 
of 
the 
verbiage 
found 
in 
the 
Constitution 
consists 
not 
in 
analyzing 
assurances 
that 
already 
exist 
in 
a 
completed 
form 
in 
the 
Constitution, 
but 
rather 
consist 
in 
completing 
the 
assurances 
that 
are 
initiated, 
but 
not 
completed, 
by 
that 
verbiage. 
So 
those 
rulings 
complete 
Constitutional 
assurances. 


Here 
it 
may 
help 
to 
focus 
on 
a 
few 
platitudes. 
A 
so-called 
assurance 
that 
isn’t 
understood 
isn’t 
an 
assurance 
at 
all. 
If 
you 
don’t 
speak 
English, 
and 
I 
say 
“I 
assure 
you 
that 
I 
will 
protect 
you 
from 
the 
local 
Mafia 
chieftain”, 
I 
haven’t 
actually 
assured 
you 
of 
anything, 
though 
I 
have 
attempted 
to 
do 
so. 
So 
far 
as 
a 
(so-called) 
assurance 
is 
vague 
or 
unclear, 
it 
is 
no 
assurance, 
but 
merely 
an 
attempted 
assurance. 
Consequently, 
so 
far 
as 
the 
verbiage 
in 
the 
Constitution 
requires 
interpretation 
– 
in 
other 
words, 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
unclear 
what 
those 
words 
are 
meant 
to 
assure, 
or 
who 
they 
are 
meant 
to 
give 
those 
assurances 
to 
– 
no 
assurance 
has 
been 
provided 
by 
them. 
(There 
has 
been 
only 
an 
attempt 
to 
give 
an 
assurance.) 
Since, 
for 
reasons 
that 
we 
will 
see, 
laws 
are 
assurances 
(on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
government) 
of 
protections, 
it 
follows 
that, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
verbiage 
in 
the 
Constitution 
requires 
judicial 



clarification, 
that 
verbiage 
fails 
to 
provid 
laws. 
From 
this, 
it 
follows 
that 
judicial 
“ 
actually 
complete 
the 
incomplete 
assuran 
that 
laws 
are 
governmental 
assurances, 
i 
Constitution 
plus 
the 
needed 
judicial 
com 
they 
are 
usually 
called) 
that 
constitute 
la 
when 
a 
judge’s 
ruling 
embodies 
a 
deline 
obscure 
part 
of 
the 
Constitution, 
that 
rul 
contradiction 
(at 
least 
not 
any 
legal 
cont 
Constitution. 


Let 
me 
sum 
up 
the 
obscure 
and 
dens 
far 
as 
they 
are 
in 
need 
of 
interpretation, 
facto 
fail 
to 
provide 
assurances. 
So 
far 
a 
ipso 
facto 
fail 
to 
be 
law. 
The 
supplemen 
those 
contents 
to 
become 
law. 
Conseque 
contradict 
those 
contents. 


Fuller’s 
picture 
is 
this: 
we 
have 
the 
C 
have 
judicial 
rulings, 
on 
the 
other. 
Both 
When 
a 
judge 
rules

way,

Fuller.) 
But 
judges

a 
judge 
does 
so, 
the 
law 
created 
by 
the 
ju 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
law 
found 
in 
the 
Co 
incoherent. 


My 
picture 
is 
this. 
First, 
because 
F 
we 
distinguish 
legal 
reality 
from 
the 
law 
wrong 
and 
must 
therefore 
be 
rejected. 
G

One
