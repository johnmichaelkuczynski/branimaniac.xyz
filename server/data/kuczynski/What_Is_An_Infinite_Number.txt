FINITE NUMBERS AS INDUCTIVE NUMBERS

A cardinal number is the number of elements of a class. Thus, the cardinal number of K={Larry, Moe, Curly} is three. In other words, [K]=3.

A finite cardinal is an inductive cardinal, and a transfinite (or infinite) cardinal is a non-inductive cardinal.

Explanation: Let ℕ be the smallest class that contains 0 and that contains n+1 whenever it contains n. In other words, n∈ℕ smallest class that contains 0 and that contains n+1 whenever it contains n. In that case, n∈ℕ (read: n is an element of ℕ) just in case either n=0 or n=m+1, where m is an arbitrary element of ℕ.

Thus, for any finite number n, there is some object X and some operation O such that, if one starts with X, one need only apply O a finite number of times, possibly zero times, to generate X.

TRANSFINITE NUMBERS AS NON-INDUCTIVE NUMBERS

Question: Is the cardinal number of ℕ finite?

No: Let ℵ₀ be the cardinal number of ℕ. If one starts with 0 and applies +1 a finite number of times, one will not reach ℵ₀. Thus, ℵ₀ is transfinite by virtue of being non-inductive. In general, a transfinite cardinal is a non-inductive cardinal.

TRANSFINITE NUMBERS AS THE NUMBERS OF REFLEXIVE CLASSES

There is a second way of defining "transfinite number": A transfinite number is the number of a reflexive class.

A class K is reflexive iff (read: if and only if) K can be bijected with a proper subset of itself. K can be bijected with K* iff there is a one-one (read: one to one) function from the one class to the other, i.e. if there is a function ϕ such that ϕ assigns at least one element of K* to any given element of K and such that ϕ never assigns the same element of K* to more than one element of K.

ℕ can be bijected with a proper subset of itself.

First example: Let ℕ₂ be the class of all even numbers, i.e. let ℕ₂ be the class of all elements of ℕ that are divisible by 2. The function F(x)=2x bijects ℕ and ℕ₂.

Second example: Let ℕₚ be the class of all prime numbers. The function P(x) bijects ℕ and ℕₚ, where P(x) assigns 1 to 1 and, for any n>1, assigns the smallest prime p≥n that has not already been assigned.

TWO CONCEPTIONS OF CLASS-SIZE

Question: What does it mean to say that two classes K and K* have the same number of elements? In other words, under what circumstances is it the case that [K]=[K*]?

There are two distinct but equally legitimate answers to this question:

Answer #1: [K]=[K*] iff K≈K*. In other words, the number of elements in K is the same as number of elements in K* iff K can be bijected with K*.

Answer #2: [K]=[K*] iff:
(i) K≈K*,
(ii) Neither class is identical with, or capable of being bijected with, any class that is a proper subset of the other.

Explanation of Answer #1: Let K be the number of forks that you have, and let K* be the number of spoons that you have. [K]=[K*] iff K≈K*.

Problem with Answer #1: There is presumably some sense in which K₂ (the class of even numbers) has fewer elements than ℕ, and there is presumably some sense in which Kₚ (the class of primes) has fewer elements than ℕ. In general, if K⊂K*---i.e. if K is a proper subset of K*, meaning that every element of K is an element of K* but not vice versa---then [K]<[K*].

Hence Answer #2, according to which (a) K≈K* is necessary but not sufficient for (b) [K]=[K*], it also being necessary that (c) For any class K#, if either K or K* can be bijected with K#, then neither K nor K* is a proper subset of K#.

Answer #2 is generally accepted, and Answer #1 is generally rejected. In what follows, we will assume the truth of Answer #2.

THREE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE

An order of magnitude is not a specific magnitude, but is rather a range of magnitudes that are mathematically similar in some important respect.

For the purposes of set-theory, this being the study of class-size, there are ultimately three orders of magnitude:
(i) Finite,
(ii) Infinite and recursive, and
(iii) Infinite and non-recursive.

Given a class K, [K] is finite if there is some n such that (a) n∈ℕ, and (b) [K]=n.

[K] is infinite and recursive iff [K]=ℵ₀. In other words, [K] is denumerable iff K is recursively definable.

K is recursively definable iff, for some object α and some function ϕ, x∈K iff:
(i) x=α or
(ii) x=ϕ(β), where β∈K.

In other words, K is recursive iff, for some object α and some function ϕ, K is the posterity of α with respect to ϕ.

Proposition: If each of K and K* is recursively definable, then [K]=[K*].

Proof: Being recursively definable, each class is the posterity of α with respect to ϕ, for some object α and some operation ϕ, and that class may therefore be bijected with ℕ by associating (A) α with 0 and (B) ϕ(x) with n+1, whenever x is associated with n. Given that any two classes that can be bijected with a third class can be bijected with each other, it follows that K≈K*.

Let ℤ be the class of signed integers. +3 and -4 are signed integers. In general, if n is an integer, then +n and -n are signed integers.

Proposition: [ℤ]=[ℕ]. Proof: ϕ bijects ℕ and ℤ, where:
(i) ϕ(0)=−1,
(ii) ϕ(n+1)=+n whenever ϕ(n)=−n, and
(iii) ϕ(n+1)=−n whenever ϕ(n)=+n.

ϕ assigns −1 to 0, +1 to 1, −2 to 2, +2 to 3, and so on.

Thus, [ℤ]=ℵ₀=[ℕ]. Q.E.D.

Let ℚ be the class of rational numbers, a rational number being one of the form m/n, where each of m and n is an integer. Proposition: ℚ is recursive. Proof: Given two rationals a/b and c/d, put a/b before c/d if a+b<c+d and put c/d before a/b if a+b>c+d. If a+b=c+d, put a/b before b/c if a+b<c+d; otherwise, put c/d before a/b. This gives us the following series:

1/1, ½, 2/1, 1/3, 2/2, 3/1, ¼, 2/3, 3/2, 4/1, 1/5, 2/4, 3/3, 4/2, 5/1,…

There is no rational that does not occur in this series. Define a function ϕ such that ϕ(1)=1/1 and such that, if ϕ(n) is the nth member of the above series, then ϕ(n+1) is the member following the nth member. ϕ recursively defines ℚ, and in so doing it bijects ℕ and ℚ. Thus [ℕ]=[ℚ]=ℵ₀. Q.E.D.

SERIES, SEQUENCES, AND LIMITS

A series is a class whose elements have been ordered. In other words, a series is a class each of whose elements has been associated with a number and no two of whose elements have been assigned the same number. Thus, the series 1, 2, 3, 4,… is identical with the class whose elements are (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), etc., and the series 0, 1, 2, 3,… is identical with the class whose elements are (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), etc.

This last series is defined by the ordered pair (ℕ, <), the first element of which corresponds to the elements being ordered and the second element of which corresponds to the relevant ordering-relation.

A sequence is a discrete series. A discrete series is one each of whose elements has an immediate successor. Thus, (ℕ, <) is a sequence. A series that is not discrete is compact. Thus, (ℚ, <) is a compact series, and so is (ℝ, <).

Given a class K, the elements of K can be arranged in a sequence just in case K is either finite or infinite but recursive.

A continuous series is a compact series that contains each of its own limits. Let S be a series or series-segment and let R be the corresponding ordering-relation. In that case, L is a limit of S just in case:
(i) Any given element of S bears R to L,
(ii) L does not bear R to any element of S, and
(iii) There is no non-element N of S such that N bears R to L.

For example, if ℚ√2 is the class of all elements of ℚ whose squares are less than 2, then √2 is the limit of (ℚ√2, <).

Another example: If ℚ₁ is the series ½, ¾, 7/8, 15/16,… then the limit of ℚ₁ is 1.

√2 is not an element of ℚ, and √2 therefore doesn't belong to (ℚ, <). Many of the limiting points of (ℚ, <) do not belong to (ℚ, <). For this reason, (ℚ, <) is not continuous even though it is compact. By contrast, (ℝ, <) is both compact and continuous.

All continuous series are compact, but not vice versa.

[ℝ]>[ℕ]

Proposition: ℝ is both infinite and non-recursive, i.e. ℝ is non-denumerable.

Proof: Let S be an arbitrary sequence of real numbers, each of which is expressed as a non-repeating decimal. Define a function D(S) such that if n is the figure in the nth decimal place in the nth member of S, then D(S) replaces n with n+1 if n<9 and D(S) replaces n with 1 if n=9. D(S) generates a number N such that, for each n, the figure in the nth decimal place in N is different from the figure in the nth decimal place in the nth member of S. Given that any series of figures defines a real number, it follows that there is no sequence of real numbers that contains every real number. Equivalently, there is no recursive definition of ℝ. Q.E.D.

It follows that [ℝ]>[ℚ]. Given that [ℚ]=[ℕ] and that [ℕ]=ℵ₀, it follows that [ℝ]>ℵ₀. It also follows---though the requisite proof falls outside the scope of this monograph---that (ℝ, <) contains each of its own limiting points.

ENUMERABLE VS. NON-DENUMERABLE

To enumerate is to count. It is always the elements of classes that are counted. In other words, to count is to determine a class-size. When you count your socks, you are counting the elements of k, this being the class of your socks.

An enumeration of a class k is a function that bijects the elements of k with those of an initial segment (a segment that includes 0 and that includes n whenever it includes n+1) of (ℕ, <), this being the series 0, 1, 2, 3,… If [k]=[ℕ], then the initial segment in question is an improper one.

If [k]>[ℕ], then k cannot be enumerated, i.e. it is non-denumerable. ℝ is non-denumerable, as previously proved.

THE POWER-SET THEOREM

Proposition: For any K, whether finite or infinite, [PK]>[K]. Proof: Assume arguendo that [PK]=[K]. In that case, there is a function ϕ from K to PK that bijects those two classes. Define a subset k of K such that, if x is an arbitrary element of K, then x∈k iff x∉ϕ(x). Let α be an element of K such that ϕ(α)=k. If α∈k, then α∉ϕ(α); and if α∉ϕ(α), then α∉k. Therefore, α∈k iff α∉k. Therefore, there is no α such that ϕ(α)=k. Therefore, contrary to our assumption, there is no function ϕ such that ϕ bijects K and PK. Therefore, [PK]≠[K]. Given that, for each element x of K, there is a corresponding element {x} of PK, it follows that PK is at least as large as K. Therefore, given that [PK]≠[K], it follows that [PK]>[K]. Q.E.D.

[PK]=2^[K]

Let ∅ be the empty set, i.e. the set that has no members. There is only one such set. This is because K and K* are different sets only if one of them has some member not had by the other. If K and K* are empty sets, neither has any members not had by the other; wherefore, K and K* are not different sets.

Given a class K, let PK be the power-set of K, meaning that PK is the set of all subsets of K.

Proposition: Given any class K, ∅ is an element of PK. Proof: A class C is a subset of a class C* just in case there is no element of C that is not also an element of C*. Given that ∅ has no elements, it follows that ∅ has no elements that it does not share with K. Therefore, ∅ is a subset of K, for any K.

Proposition: For any K, whether finite or infinite, [PK]=2^[K]. Proof by induction: First, prove that if [K]=0. In that case, [PK]=2^0=1. Proof: Let K=∅. Given that ∅ is a subset of any given class, it follows that ∅ is a subset of ∅. Given that ∅ has no members, it follows that ∅ is the only subset of ∅. Therefore, [P∅]=1. Given that n^0=1, for any n, it follows that 2^0=1, when [K]=0. If [K]=n and [K*]=[K]+1, then [PK*]=2×[PK]=2^([PK]+1). Next, prove that, for any n, if [K]=n, then [PK]=2^n. Proof: Assume that [K*]=[K]+1. In that case, there is some α such that K*=K∪{α}. Therefore, for each element k of PK, there is exactly one element k* of PK* such that k*=k∪{α}. Therefore, [PK*]=2×[PK]=2×2^[K]=2^([K]+1). Therefore, if [K]=0, [PK]=2^0=1, and, for any n>0, if [K]=n, [PK]=2^n. Therefore, for any n, [PK]=2^[K]. Q.E.D.

It follows that for any class K, whether finite or transfinite, [PK]=2^[K].

ORDERS OF INFINITY

Given that [PK]=2^[K]>[K], for any K, whether finite or infinite, it follows that there are infinitely many transfinites and, therefore, infinitely many orders of infinity.

[ℝ]>[ℕ]. (Already proved.) [ℕ]=ℵ₀. (This is a matter of definition.) ℵ₁ =ᴅғ The smallest transfinite greater than ℵ₀. This much is known.

What is not known is whether ℵ₁=2^ℵ₀. Indeed, given any n, it is unknown whether ℵₙ₊₁=2^ℵₙ.

The Continuum Hypothesis is the position that [ℝ]=[Pℕ]=ℵ₁.

The Generalized Continuum Hypothesis is the position that, for any infinitely large class K, [PK] is the smallest number that is greater than [K].

CARDINAL ARITHMETIC

In order to understand the arithmetic of transfinites, we must understand the arithmetic of finites.

The meaning of 2+3=5 is the union of a two-membered class with a non-overlapping three-membered class is a five-membered class. In general, A+B=C means the union of an A-membered class and a non-overlapping B-membered class is a C-membered class.

The meaning of 2×3=6 is the Cartesian Product of a two-membered class and a three-membered class is a six-membered class. (For obvious reasons, it does not matter whether or not the classes in question overlap.) In general, the meaning of A×B=C is the Cartesian Product of an A-membered class and a B-membered class is a C-membered class.

Finally, the meaning of 2^3=8 is there are eight selections from a three-membered class of two-membered classes, meaning that there are eight different classes K# such that (a) K# has exactly one element in common with each element of K and (b) K# has no members that do not belong to K.

Explanation: Let K be the smallest class whose members are: {a,b}, {c,d}, {e,f}. In that case, K# is the smallest class whose members are:
{a, c, e}
{a, c, f}
{a, d, e}
{a, d, f}
{b, c, e}
{b, c, f}
{b, d, e}
{b, d, f}.

In general, the meaning of A^B=C is there are C-many selections from a B-membered class of A-membered classes.

Cardinal arithmetic concerns unordered classes, as opposed to sequences (ordered classes). Therefore, where cardinals are concerned, be they finite or transfinite, addition and multiplication are necessarily commutative. Therefore, cardinal addition and multiplication are always distinct operations from their ordinal analogues. Where finite cardinals are concerned, cardinal addition and multiplication are in lockstep with their ordinal analogues. This is not the case where transfinite cardinals are concerned, and it was only when the arithmetic of transfinites was first seriously investigated that the distinction between cardinals and ordinals was first made. Once it was made, it proved to be of great importance, primarily because it facilitated the development of vector-arithmetic, which is generalized ordinal arithmetic.

TRANSFINITE CARDINAL ARITHMETIC: ADDITION AND MULTIPLICATION

If n is any finite number, ℵ₀+n=ℵ₀. Let S₁ be identical with (ℕ, <), that is, with the sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3,…

And let S₂ be identical with the sequence: (0,0), (1,1), 0, 1, 2, 3,…

ϕ bijects the elements of S₁ with the elements of S₂, where:
(i) ϕ(0)=(0,0),
(ii) ϕ(1)=(1,1), and
(iii) For any cardinal n≥2, ϕ(n)=n-2.

Thus, S₁ has exactly as many members as S₂, and it follows that ℵ₀+2=ℵ₀. By parity of reasoning, S₁ has exactly as many members as Sₙ, where Sₙ is an arbitrary class that contains every element of some class K that has ℵ₀-many members, along with n-many members that do not belong to K.

For similar reasons, ℵ₀×n=ℵ₀, for any finite cardinal n. Explanation: Let Kₜ be the smallest class such that:
(i) Every element of ℕ belongs to Kₜ, and
(ii) For each element n of ℕ, (n, n) belongs to Kₜ.

ϕ bijects ℕ and Kₜ, where:
(a) ϕ(0)=(0,0),
(b) ϕ(1)=0,
(c) For any odd n>1, ϕ(n)=(n-1)/2, and
(d) For every even n>0, ϕ(n)=((n-2)/2, (n-2)/2).

ϕ assigns 0 to (0,0), 1 to 0, 2 to (1,1), 3 to 1, 4 to (2, 2), and so on. It follows that ℵ₀×2=ℵ₀. For any finite n, obvious generalizations of this reasoning establish that ℵ₀×n=ℵ₀, and non-obvious generalizations establish ℵ₀×ℵ₀=ℵ₀=ℵ₀².

TRANSFINITE CARDINAL ARITHMETIC: SUBTRACTION AND DIVISION

If A and B are transfinite cardinals, A−B is infinitely ambiguous, and so is A÷B.

Let K and K* each be identical with ℕ. In that case, A−B=ℵ₀−ℵ₀=0.

Let A and B be identical with, respectively, ℕ and the class containing every element of ℕ other than 1. In that case, A−B=ℵ₀−ℵ₀=1.

Let A and B be identical with, respectively, ℕ and the class containing every element of ℕ other than 1 and 2. In that case, A−B=ℵ₀−ℵ₀=2.

Let A and B be identical with ℕ and the smallest class containing every even element of ℕ. In that case, A÷B=ℵ₀÷ℵ₀=ℵ₀.

Finally, let A and B both be identical with ℕ. In that case, A÷B=ℵ₀÷ℵ₀=1.

By non-obvious extensions of this reasoning, ℵ₀÷ℵ₀ may equal n, for any given cardinal n, and ℵ₀−ℵ₀ may equal n, for any given cardinal n.

ORDINAL NUMBERS AND ORDINAL TRANSFINITE ARITHMETIC

An ordinal number is the number of elements in a series. In other words, let S be a given series. In that case, the ordinal of S is the number of elements of S. Thus, the ordinal of the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3 is 4, and the ordinal of the sequence 1, 2, 3 is 3.

Let ω be the ordinal of ℕ. Ordinal addition is non-commutative: ω+1=the order-type of the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3,…, ω = the first order-type that is greater than any finite order-type. But: 1+ω=ω, for the simple reason that if the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3,… is preceded by an object α that does not belong to that series, then the resulting series is simply a rearranged version of 0, 1, 2, 3,…, whose order-type is ω.

In general, n+ω=ω, for any finite ordinal n. Similarly, ω×n=ω+ω+…ω (n many times), which ≠ω, but n×ω=ω, since n×ω=n+n+n+… (ω-many times)=ω.

THE IMPORTANCE OF ORDINALS

The distinction between cardinals and ordinals first became clear when mathematicians began to investigate the properties of transfinite numbers. Where finite numbers are concerned, the cardinal-ordinal distinction has no practical relevance: 2+3=3+2=5, whether the addition in question is cardinal or ordinal. But in the transfinite case, 1+ω=ω≠ω+1: 1+ω is simply a rearrangement of ω, while ω+1 is a series that has one more element than ω.

IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT [ℝ]=2^ℵ₀

The cardinality of the real numbers equals 2^ℵ₀. This is because every real number can be expressed as an infinite binary expansion, and there is a one-one correspondence between such expansions and elements of P(ℕ).

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FACT THAT [ℝ]=[ℝ]^n

For any finite n, [ℝ]^n=[ℝ]. This means that the set of all ordered n-tuples of real numbers has the same cardinality as ℝ itself. The n-dimensional real coordinate space ℝ^n has the same cardinality as the one-dimensional real line.

This is philosophically significant: our ordinary conception of "more" breaks down in the infinite case. Adding dimensions does not increase cardinality at the level of the continuum.
