KUCZYNSKI: OCD AND PHILOSOPHY - SHORT PAPERS ON OCD, PSYCHOPATHY, AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY
Comprehensive Positions Document

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE NATURE OF OCD
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• OCD IS FUNDAMENTALLY A DEFENSE MECHANISM. It provides relief from anxiety so intense as to be "almost inconceivable" to those who haven't experienced it.

• OCD IS ULTIMATELY A VOLUNTARY AFFLICTION—AN AFFLICTION OF THE WILL. Unlike cancer or asthma, OCD involves the integrity of one's will and can be overcome by exercising that will.

• OCD symptoms are only "INVOLUNTARY" RELATIVE TO A DETERMINATION TO REMAIN DISENGAGED from the world. If one chooses re-engagement, the symptoms become voluntary and controllable.

• OCD CAN ASSUME PRODUCTIVE, NON-PATHOLOGICAL FORMS. Beethoven and Einstein exemplify OCD channeled adaptively.

• OCD INVOLVES MISDEPLOYED INTELLIGENCE AND FOCUS. It represents heightened abilities directed maladaptively.

• OCD CREATES A PSYCHOLOGICAL "SAFE-SPACE." Obsessions and compulsions encircle and protect the subject from a toxic, threatening environment.

• The obsessive-compulsive is a "CRYPTO-CRIMINAL." Their fundamental orientation toward others is anti-social, but strong superegos cause them to suppress their criminal side through legalistic preoccupations.

• Obsessive-compulsives are driven by RAGE, NARCISSISM, AND FEAR—NOT RATIONALITY. Their intellectualism is a reaction to, and attempt to cloak, their "darkly retrograde psychological condition."

• The obsessive-compulsive's DOUBTS ABOUT THE EXTERNAL WORLD ARE ACTUALLY DISPLACED DOUBTS ABOUT THE INTERNAL WORLD. They are uncertain about their own psychic contents, not about external reality.

• The obsessive-compulsive must ACCEPT HIS OWN SADISTIC SEXUALITY.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OCD AND PHILOSOPHY—THE STRUCTURAL PARALLEL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• PHILOSOPHERS AND OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVES SHARE THE SAME PSYCHOLOGICAL STRUCTURE. Both are compulsive doubters who doubt the obvious under the guise of rigor.

• Both philosophers and obsessive-compulsives are IMPOTENT—TOO FEARFUL TO ENGAGE THE WORLD DIRECTLY. Their potency lies only in manipulating symbolic proxies of reality.

• Both attempt to INTERNALIZE THE WORLD INTO THE SPHERE OF THEIR OWN THOUGHT, where they are dominant. This is compensatory behavior for worldly impotence.

• PREOCCUPATION WITH LOGICAL NICETIES AND FINE POINTS OF ARGUMENTATION IS DERIVATIVE OF A SENSE OF IMPOTENCE. When one has no material of one's own, one preoccupies oneself with secondary, formal matters.

• CONDITIONALIZING ACCEPTANCE OF HYPOTHESES ON SUBTLETIES OF PROOF allows indefinite deferral of engagement with reality. Logical and dialectical niceties are "incapable of being definitely resolved" by their very nature.

• Both philosophers and obsessive-compulsives are PATHOLOGICALLY CONCERNED WITH ETHICS. This stems from their crypto-criminal nature combined with draconian superegos.

• Philosophical insistence on the "RATIONALITY OF MAN" IS MERELY AN IDEALIZATION—A PROJECTED SELF-IMAGE. It does not describe actual human psychology.

• The LOCKEAN/CARTESIAN DENIAL OF THE UNCONSCIOUS IS A "TENDENTIOUS RATIONALIZATION." The claim that mind extends only as far as consciousness is "brazenly spurious."

• The obsessive-compulsive/philosopher believes himself a "LOGIC-DRIVEN CARTESIAN RATIOCINATOR" when his Cartesianism is only a thin veneer. Beneath lies a "NIETZSCHEAN CESSPOOL."

• Many obsessive-compulsives and philosophers GO INTO LAW. This follows from their preoccupation with legalistic technicalities.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• THE WAY TO BEAT OCD IS TO HAVE A PURPOSE IN LIFE. Purpose-directed engagement with the world is therapeutic.

• CBT HAS LIMITED, SHALLOW, AND SHORT-LIVED EFFECTS ON OCD. It cannot work absent a deeper determination to grow and change.

• THE PROGNOSIS FOR OCD IS 100% POSITIVE if the patient sees OCD as the voluntary condition it is. If seen as a "garden-variety pathology," the prognosis is negative.

• OCD IS ELIMINATED (OR MADE ADAPTIVE) BY EXERCISING ONE'S WILL IN GROWTH-ORIENTED WAYS. The obsessive-compulsive must choose: mere freedom from anxiety, or living and growing.

• EFFECTIVE THERAPISTS MUST HAVE AND PROJECT INNER STRENGTH.

• "STRUCTURAL THERAPY" is advocated as an approach.

• "TURN OCD AGAINST ITSELF" is a therapeutic strategy.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MENTAL ILLNESS VS. PHYSICAL ILLNESS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT "AN ILLNESS LIKE ANY OTHER." It differs categorically from physical illness.

• MENTAL ILLNESSES ARE CONTEXTUAL IN NATURE. OCD is a liability in some contexts and an asset in others. Physical illnesses (asthma, lupus, cancer) are simply liabilities in all contexts.

• MENTAL ILLNESSES SERVE A DEFENSIVE/PROTECTIVE FUNCTION. Even gravely dysfunctional conditions like psychosis provide some measure of psychological safety.

• PSYCHOSIS IS A CHOSEN WITHDRAWAL FROM DESTRUCTIVE NEGATIVITY. The psychotic retreats into delusion to escape threatening environments and assaults on self-worth.

• SOME MENTAL ILLNESSES INVOLVE MISDEPLOYED STRENGTHS. Schizophrenia involves misdeployed creativity and emotional sensitivity.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PSYCHOPATHY AND BUREAUCRACY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• PSYCHOPATHS ARE "ROGUE BUREAUCRATS."

• BUREAUCRATS ARE "NON-ROGUE PSYCHOPATHS." Bureaucratic psychology is structurally psychopathic.

• There is a distinct "PSYCHOLOGY OF THE BUREAUCRAT."

• "INSTITUTIONAL PSYCHOPATHY" EXISTS AS A PHENOMENON.

• PSYCHOPATHS OVERACHIEVE.

• BUREAUCRATIC BLOAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AN OCD-SPIKE. Social/institutional factors cause increased OCD prevalence.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL POSITIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY HAS FAILED TO ENGAGE REALITY.

• "SUBMITTING TO FEMINISM MAKES IT MORE PSYCHOPATHIC."

• "DOUBLE-THINK" IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY POSSIBLE AND EXPLICABLE.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RELATED PSYCHOPATHOLOGY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• SOCIAL ANXIETY IS FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT RAGE. Social anxiety masks underlying hostility.

• AUTISM CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS "PSEUDO-SELF-CONTAINMENT."

• A HEALTHY SEX LIFE HAS THERAPEUTIC SIGNIFICANCE.

• There is such a thing as "PSYCHIATRIC MUNCHAUSEN'S BY PROXY." Parents (especially mothers) seek false psychiatric diagnoses for their children.

• FALSE DIAGNOSES OF AUTISM, ASPERGER'S, AND ADHD ARE FORMS OF "CLOAKED CHILD MURDER." The mother, seeking attention from the husband, damages the child via psychiatric over-intervention.

• PSYCHIATRISTS AND EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE GENERALLY UNINTELLIGENT AND WILLING TO ISSUE FALSE DIAGNOSES. They need money and need to validate their profession.

• When a child is sent to a psychiatrist, THE MOTHER'S PSYCHOLOGY SHOULD BE EXAMINED FIRST. The child's mind shows "fallout from the blast," not the epicenter.

• INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS IN OCD HAVE A SPECIFIC EXPLANATION.

• PEOPLE WITH OCD HAVE READING-RELATED DIFFICULTIES.

• COMPULSIONS WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING OBSESSIONS REQUIRE DISTINCT TREATMENT.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
AUTO-HYPNOSIS VS. RATIONALIZATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• AUTO-HYPNOSIS IS NOT INHERENTLY BAD; IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR ACTION. Someone who only followed through on plans validated by critical judgment would be "the ultimate bureaucrat" and would never do anything.

• AUTO-HYPNOSIS IS DISTINCT FROM RATIONALIZATION. Auto-hypnosis generates attitude without deploying/misdeploying critical faculties; rationalization generates conviction from a warped understanding of reality.

• NEGATIVE AUTO-HYPNOSIS (obsessing, ruminating, wallowing) IS BAD BUT EASILY REVERSED. Once recognized as self-hypnosis, one can flip a mental switch to affirmative auto-hypnosis.

• RATIONALIZATION IS INHERENTLY BAD. Unlike auto-hypnosis, it perverts one's faculty of judgment.

• AUTO-HYPNOSIS DRAWS ENTHUSIASM FROM WITHIN ONESELF; RATIONALIZATION DRAWS IT FROM DISTORTED COGNITION.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• There are TWO WAYS IN WHICH INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY PROMOTES INTELLIGENCE.
