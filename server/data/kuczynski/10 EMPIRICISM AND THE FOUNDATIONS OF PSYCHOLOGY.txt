is intelligence that is applied in accordance with one's values to problems relating to the preservation, diminution, or augmentation of one's agency. 
Sally is committing psychological suicide. She is trying to change who she is, not how she is. But one can't change who one is. One's identity is predetermined. Experience doesn't determine who one is; it determines how one is who one is. 
There have been studies of identical twins who were raised in different 
environments. One twin would be raised in a mansion, the other in a hovel.272 One would go to an elite boarding school, the other to the local public school. Such twins were identical in respect of their IQs, degree of spirituality, and to what degree, and in what manner, they were social or anti-social. A person can change himself, but he cannot change his self. Changes to oneself, if they are not to render one's self defunct, must occur within limits set by one's inborn biological structure. In internalizing SC, so far as she could do so, Sally was not operating within those limits. This means that, qua SC-believer, she doesn't have the support of her own native endowment. 
Initially, she had its support. That is why she could still draw on her intellect and determination in carrying out her deoperationalization of it. But having carried it out, she no longer has it.

:: Q A 
Rationalizations are not, and cannot be, anything like the following: (AR273) I am going to become a lazy, self-indulgent slob. I will do whatever I want to do, no matter how immoral or otherwise repellant. I will not act like a mature person. I will not act like somebody who, developmentally, never made it past pre- adolescence. I will act in ways that will draw the legitimate censure of others. 
AR is the opposite of a rationalization. This doesn't mean that it couldn't be somebody's intention or that, if it were, it couldn't be carried out. It means only that, in so intending, one wouldn't be rationalizing. Somebody with such an intention would be giving up; their conscious intention would be to commit a kind of suicide; and if they carried out their intention, they'd do so consciously knowing as much Sociopaths don't have moral convictions. But their rationalizations make heavy allowances for moral convictions. This is because rationalizations are moralizations: 
attempts to make the immoral seem moral. So sociopathy-conducive rationalizations are dispositive of correct, if not hyper-correct, conduct and speech. A person who is genuinely moral will inevitably say and do things that others describe as immoral, even though they're hyper-moral. The employee of an institution who tries to change its iniquitous (but lucrative) practices will be described as "upstart," as "not being a team-player," as "having no respect for authority." Although propriety and morality overlap, the degree of overlap is not 100%. Also, what qualifies as proper varies from

Q A 
I suspect that everyone has always known that the theory of evolution is correct. Children see animals as para-people. Children play with stuffed animals, watch shows in which the characters are people-like animals, and have disputes with their pet dogs. Evidently, children aren't troubled by the idea of seeing animals as being cut from the same cloth as themselves. The members of pre-Judeo-Christian religions explicitly claim they are descended from animals. A tribe's "totem" is the animal (or animalkind, rather) from which the tribesmen profess themselves to be descendants. Home Sapiens has been in existence for at least 100,000 years, during all but the last 2,000 of which its members saw animals as being of their ilk and as their forefathers. Whereas it's a complement to be described as a "tiger" or a "stallion," it's an insult to be described as a "monkey" or a "baboon," even though the members of the latter two species are exponentially more intelligent than the members of the former two. When contemplating tigers and stallions, we can focus on their virtues, but we cannot do so when contemplating simians; for when doing so, we are reminded of our ignominious simian origins and therewith of our ignominious quasi-simian current selves. Having stated these conjectures, let us return to the topic of sociopathy. 
6.0 Sociopathogenesis is psychological suicide. At some level, Sociopaths are aware of what they've lost, and they resent those who haven't lost it.

contraindicated removal of the clitoris for cultural, social, or religious reasons. Its analogue for a male would be the removal of the glans. The process doesn't take place in a female's infancy, but rather when she is in her mid-teens, at which time she has at least some awareness of the importance of the clitoris. 
The operation is performed by other women. Although I do not know this for a fact, I would presume that only psychologically damaged women would freely submit to 
circumcision. 
The procedure seldom involves anasthetic and is seldom performed with sterile surgical instruments. Sometimes it is performed with pieces of broken glass. 
Oftentimes, despite the overwhelming cultural pressure to submit to the procedure, females about to undergo it have to be physically restrained. This too is done by females who have themselves undergone the operation. 
Analysis: Nobody wants others to have what they have given up. Those who perform the procedure don't want others to have what they gave up. That is why they do so enthusiastically, making no attempt to hide their glee. Human nature being what it is, their enthusiasm is driven by a wish to deprive another person of what one has lost. Misery loves company. 
Sociopaths make a show of being friendly. But they don't have friends; for they don't have values, and a friend is somebody one values. To the extent that sociopaths behave authentically towards others, they are unremittingly undermining. But it is

Q A 
Acquired behavioural sociopathy/sociological conditioning (Item 21: a newly identified trait i.e. a person relying on sociological strategies and tricks to deceive) According to Hare and other psychopathy-specialists, a psychopath needn't have all of the characteristic on this list and a non-psychopath may have some of them. All authorities agree that this list has to be applied with at least some discretion. Like Otto Kernberg (1985, 1993), the present authors believes that, although fundamentally accurate, it has to be applied with extreme discretion. The reasons for this will become evident in the very last section of the book, in which we discuss criminality, which is radically different from both sociopathy and psychopathy. 
There is another problem with Hare's checklist and with Hare's (1999) book on psychopathy, Without Conscience, which is considered authoritative. Neither that

all is intact on the outside. Good function (healthy reactivity) will be demonstrated in all theoretical truths. Judgment as well as sound reasoning will appear at verbal levels. Ethical as well as practical considerations will be recognized in the abstract. A brilliant mimicry of sound, social reactions will occur in every test except the test of life itself. In the psychopath, we confront a personality neither broken nor outwardly distorted but of a substance that lacks ingredients without which normal function in major life issues is impossible.276 
The [psychopath's] out functional aspect masks or disguises something quite different within, concealing behind a perfect mimicry of normal emotion, fine intelligence, and social responsibility a grossly disabled and irresponsible personality. 277 
To be a psychopath is to be a fraud. It is to be a nobody disguised as a somebody. The essence of psychopathy is phoniness. Cleckley states that clearly. Hare seems to hold that the essence of psychopathy is criminality. Criminality is a frequent by-product of psychopathy, nothing more. In Section 11.0, it will be made clear why criminality isn't the same thing as psychopathy.

master-rationalizations regulates his ideation or conduct. A consequence is that, whereas the sociopath is, in respect of his behavior, an arch-conformist, the psychopath tends to behave in decidedly abnormal ways. Since the psychopath, unlike the sociopath, doesn't have to operate within some master-rationalization, there are no rules 
even empty, purely formal ones - by which he has to abide. The sociopath, it will be recalled, wants to believe himself to be legitimate. His descent into sociopathy was inaugurated by a master-rationalization, and that rationalization defines the structure of his current sociopathic integration. Since that rationalization is an attempt to legitimate who he now is, the sociopath is bound, not by actual morality, but by some mimicry of it. 
By contrast, psychopathy is neither initiated nor constituted by some master- rationalization. Consequently, the psychopath doesn't care about being legitimate. He doesn't even know what legitimacy is. He knows what sorts of behavior are associated with words like "legitimate," "good," "bad" etc. But he doesn't grasp the corresponding concepts. So he is free to rob and kill. The psychopath isn't bound by any code of honor, not even of the wooden, formal sort binding the sociopath. 
A consequence is that psychopath's conduct and personality differ dramatically from the sociopath's.

Q A 
Psychopaths are evasive. They can't be pinned down. When asked a question, the psychopath tends to respond with a lecture or a dramatic performance. He thereby avoids answering the question, while making onlookers think that he knows the 
answer. 
This last point must be qualified. When a psychopath knows the answer to a question, he answers it in the same way as a non-psychopath who knows the answer to it. It's when the non-psychopath doesn't know the answer that he differs from his nonpsychopathic counterpart. The latter either cops to his ignorance or inadvertently betrays a lack of confidence in what he's saying: he smiles nervously; his gaze wanders; he fidgets. If the psychopath is asked a question to which he doesn't know the answer, he either responds in the way in which he responds to questions to which he does know the answer or he responds with overblown self-confidence. 
The psychopath's question-prompted lectures are meant to seem spontaneous, and that is just how they strike people who don't know much about the topic being lectured about. But others see that those lectures are but montages of empty clichés and plagiarized apercus, accompanied by arm-flapping histrionics and confident gesticulations.

Q A 
7.3 Psychopaths are genuinely developed in one way: they know how to con people. Ironically, it's because the human condition is so alien to them that they are so expert at manipulating people. The psychopath is interested in others only to the extent that he can manipulate them. Because the psychopath's interest in others ends there, every exchange he has with anyone is, for him, an exercise in honing his skills as a manipulator. Because he himself is unlike the people he is manipulating, and also so indifferent to them, he has a major advantage over his non-psychopathic counterpart when trying to figure out just how to manipulate a given person: the psychopath does not have to "tune out" a flood of projective, a priori beliefs, and empathy-related (though

predatory and acquisitive. We are such animals. In social contexts, these instincts are expressed as desires for wealth and power. Also, all animals instinctively wish to survive. Ceteris paribus the more money and power one has, the better one's chances of surviving. 
Since being liked by others is more survival-conducive than being disliked (or simply not being liked), it might be thought that the psychopath's love of fame and glamour is to explained along the same lines as his desire for wealth. Such an explanation, however, would be incomplete, if not false. 
Psychopaths value nothing and therefore take pleasure in next to nothing. They enjoy mating and predating, since one doesn't have to have values to enjoy such acts. For the same reason, they enjoy strictly instinctual forms of affection-giving. So, for example, the psychopath may enjoy cuddling with his new puppy. (But he can't value his puppy and he therefore can't be concerned for its welfare: for all he cares, his puppy can drown after it stops being cute and fun to cuddle with.) Finally, psychopaths, like all creatures, can experience pleasures of a strictly sensual nature. So, for example, the psychopath can enjoy a good meal. But the psychopath can experience no pleasures other than those of a strictly instinctual or sensual nature. 
The psychopath's desire to have money, it must be remembered, is merely a socialized version of an animalistic instinct of some kind - e.g. to survive or to make oneself to desirable to prospective mates. Cognitively the psychopath is normal. He

what is perceptible. In the psychopath's eyes, one is only as successful as one's success is perceptible. The more perceptible – the bigger the house, the flashier the clothes, etc. - the greater the degree of success. 
But there is another, subtler reason for the psychopath's intense desire to have the perceptible concomitants of success (fame, wealth, etc.), as opposed to success per se. Many so-called "sensual" delights aren't of a strictly sensual nature. One must have values to experience aesthetic pleasure, as we saw. The music itself must be distinguished from the noises mediating it; Rembrandt's masterpieces must be distinguished from the deposits of paint that constitute them. Though mediated by noise and paint, the work of art per se is not identical with a series of noises or a discolored canvass. And aesthetic enjoyment, though mediated by audition and vision, is no more identical with such things than one's joy at discovering how to solve Russell's Paradox. It isn't the noises per se that one enjoys, but what one hears in them. What one hears in them are instances of intricate structures, and musical pleasure is a concomitant of one's awareness of the presence of those structures in the noise that one hears. So one's enjoyment of a piece of music isn't really sensual pleasure at all. It is intellectual enjoyment that is mediated by sense-perception. 
Part of the enjoyment, we hypothesized, that one takes in listening to the Hammerklavier is the joy, not just of discovery, but of self-discovery, the structures instantiated by relevant sounds being externalizations of those instantiated by one's

Q A 
joys of such intimacy. Whatever joy such acts bring to the psychopath, they come 
entirely from the strictly sensual component of such acts. Beyond that, such acts do nothing for the psychopath. 
This point holds, not just with respect to carnal activity, but with respect to every form of activity in which sense-perception is to any degree a vehicle for mentation of a valuative kind. The psychopath is thus in an unfortunate position. There are many sources of enjoyment for the non-psychopath. There are few for the psychopath. Further, there are no psychopath-specific forms of enjoyment: the non-psychopath can experience all of the strictly visceral and sensual forms of enjoyment available to the psychopath, but the psychopath's sources of enjoyment are but a small subset of the non-psychopath's. 
The psychopath must cleave to what is perceptible. Nothing else brings him enjoyment, except for the discharging of basal urges, which will often take rarefied, socialized forms, making it hard to see it for what it is.278 
8.0 Only an infinitesimally small percentage of psychopaths are serial killers. But, it is generally held, most if not all serial killers are are psychopaths. 
The hedge ("it is generally held") is not idle throat-clearing: some authors - I am thinking in particular of Helen Morrison (2005) - hold that serial killers have an even more rudimentary psychological integration than psychopaths. They hold that,

I believe probable that many persons outwardly imposing yet actually of insignificant import really are so affected. 
(b) That is of an emotional, as opposed to strictly pragmatic nature. 
So, Morrison's theory goes, psychopaths do make it to the stage at which they have object-relations. But those object-relations are sources of pain. The other party is somebody on whom the youngster depends. But that person is insufficiently attentive or she's positively sadistic. As a result, the youngster in question so parameterizes his emotional disposition to that person, and to people in general, that he can benefit from them to that they extent that they can benefit him while also being insulated from their treachery. So (if this theory is correct) the psychopath does have object- relations: but they are selfish and one-dimensional. At the same time, according to this theory, the serial killer's development often stops before he has formed object- 
relations. 
8.1 There very clearly are serial killers who are psychopaths (e.g. John Wayne Gacy,

the President's wife came to the suburb of Chicago where he lived. Since the president was a member of the same party as Gacy, that party's local chapter was required to greet her. Gacy's fellow party-members unanimously and enthusiastically asked Gacy to meet and greet the First Lady on the party's behalf. He did so. She found him utterly charming.) Gacy was a clown at children's birthday parties. He did not receive compensation for this. He volunteered his services, he said, because he “loved children." The revelers to whom his clownery brought such delight were only slightly younger than the dozens of youngsters whom he raped, tortured, butchered, and whose bodies he kept as trophies in his basement.

280. See Rule (2006). 
281. See Davis (1991). 
After being apprehended, Gacy always had a story. "I'm innocent. I never killed anybody." "Sure I killed them - but it was in self-defense." "Yes I killed them. And, no, it wasn't in self-defense. But they deserved it; they were trash; by killing them I was cleansing the world and doing humanity a favor.”

: Q A 
Ted Bundy was a psychopath-serial killer. Before being caught, he worked on a volunteer basis for a telephone hotline for people on the brink of suicide. Like Gacy, he was a political operative and a rising star in the local chapter of his political party. Although his grades and entrance-exam scores were mediocre, Bundy got into a reputable law-school - but only because the governor of his state, for whom Bundy had successfully campaigned, personally wrote him a glowing recommendation. After three months, Bundy flunked out of law school, because his days' long killing sprees took too much time away from his school-work. Soon after being ejected, he was arrested for possession of burglary tools and a rape kit. He was eventually convicted and executed for the murder of a 13 year old girl. 
Unlike Dahmer, Bundy never simply said: "I did it. I did it because I wanted to." Bundy denied everything; then he hinted at his guilt without admitting it. Then he admitted it. Then he retracted his confession. Then he retracted his retraction. Then 
he blamed society, pornography, the media - all the standard scapegoats. 
Unlike Ridgeway, Bundy while on death row had a huge female fan club, and many a woman proposed to him while he was on death row. While he stood accused of murder, but before he was convicted, Bundy's own girlfriend paid Bundy conjugal visits, Bundy's relationship with this person began before she or anyone else knew what he was. Like many others, she simply couldn't believe that Bundy was a killer, let alone a serial killer. Later she changed her mind. 
<

: Q A 
8.2 But Bundy and Gacy are representatives of only one subclass of the class of serial killers; and Ridgeway is representative of another subclass. And some authorities believe that the latter subclass is both the better populated of the two and also that its members are better, more pure representations than members of the other class of what it is to be serial killer. 
The idea is that, in cases such as Ridgeway's, serial murder is the expression of a unitary pathological deviation, whereas, in cases such as Bundy's, it is the expression of a confluence of many different forces. So what we have in Ridgeway is an isolated, specific deviation. By contrast, what we have in Bundy is such a deviation plus various psychodynamic factors. To be sure, Bundy had the requisite serial-killer-specific integration. But in Bundy that integration may to an extent have been a vehicle for ideation that, although obviously pathological, was not serial-killer-specific. In Ridgeway, that integration was operating on its own. 
282 
This position is consistent with the available data. Given publicly known facts, it's clear that some serial killers are just blanks, who lack the distinguishing characteristics of the psychopath: the glibness, the charm, the charisma, the faux- empathy, and so on.

Q A 
8.3 Earlier it was said that psychopaths are notoriously good at seducing others. They are also unusually prone to do so. But they derive little pleasure from intercourse per 
se. 
So why are so many seducers and seductresses among their ranks? They enjoy the acts deception that led to intercourse, as well as those that such act help to perpetrate. In some cases, the psychopath regards the sexual act as one of pure aggression as rape. Rapists, in fact, are categorically psychopaths. (But not all psychopaths are rapists.) 
Presumably, it's typically male psychopaths who, when having concensual sex, see what they are doing as rape. And setting aside the possibility of one female's raping

443-444/476 
Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
QA 
Incidentally, the fact the human beings are the only creatures that have "off-season" sexual intercourse is to be explained in terms of the fact that we have values: because we infuse carnal acts with those values, they are enjoyable for us in a way they cannot possibly be enjoyable for value-free creatures. 
8.4 These points relate to the famously amorphous sexuality of the psychopath. Psychopaths lack a well-defined sexual identity. (Cleckley (1941) states this clearly, and Hare (1999) duly notes it on his checklist.) They can have sex with anybody: male, female, young, and old. It's all the same to them. For them, physical intimacy has none of the valuative concomitants that it has in ordinary cases. For a non- psychopath, physical characteristics are infused with meaning. It isn't the skin-texture per se of an 80 year-old woman that makes her undesirable to a 20 year old. It is her skin-texture plus its various meanings. For the psychopath, nothing means anything. So for a 20 year old male psychopath, being intimate with a octagenarian billionaress is like having a meal one doesn't much care for, and being intimate with a stunning 30-year old beauty is like having a dish one does quite fancy. 
The psychopath's sexual amorphousness, which is an expression of his generally infantile psychological condition, is often seen as evidence of his open-mindedness, his high-minded disdain for culturally rooted bigotries, and the expansiveness of his 
ken.

Q A 
I've heard more than one psychopath described as having a “spacious consciousness." In each case, the psychopath's sexual elasticity was cited as evidence of his great spiritual and intellectual gifts. And in each case, reference's to the psychopath's "spacious consciousness" came to be replaced by less laudatory epithet, in consequence of the passage of time and the unreciprocated transmission of large funds. 
For the non-psychopath intercourse is not merely a physical act; it is fraught with emotion. And many of the aesthetic, intercourse-related preferences of the non- psychopath, while seemingly superficial, are associatively connected to object- relations with loved and valued people. At time t, Fred loves Sally, who has blond hair. Sally dumps Fred. Fred recovers emotionally; but his love for Sally embodied a legitimately high estimation of her merits, which disposes him, via the standard associative channels, to idealize, and thence to fall in love with, people who physically resemble Sally. 
With males, it is said, love starts on the outside and makes its way to the inside. This statement is ambiguous. On one disambiguation it comes to this: A man initially likes a woman for her appearance and for her appearance only. Later, after he comes to know her, he likes her for her. There is some truth in this line of thought, but less than is ordinarily thought. 
The other disambiguation gives a better description than the first of the relevant

psychodynamics. Men are indeed drawn to women for their looks, but largely (not solely) because those men unconsciously associate certain desired character traits with those looks. Moreover, a woman's having the requisite physical features is not by itself enough to sustain his interest in her. Should those features remind a given man of Ethel, who was a luminary, an inspired poet, a subtle visionary, etc. that man may initially be drawn to Gertrude, given the latter's physical resemblance to Ethel. But as soon as it becomes clear that Gertrude lacks Ethel's virtues, and has qualities antithetical to them, that man will probably lose interest in Gertrude. I thus suspect that, in some cases, the man is initially drawn to a woman because of her appearance; her appearance prompts a quick examination of her self; and if that examination establishes the presence of the requisite psychological properties, attraction ensues. 
There are of course many reasons why people fall with in love, and why men fall in love with women. It is my purpose to show that sometimes what is regarded as attraction of a strictly "prurient” kind is a foil for value-laden, positive characterizations of the desired female. That said, there is no shortage of strictly prurient ideation in the human psyche.

But the psychopath's professional successes tend to be more apparent than real. This doesn't hold in professions such as football or emergency room surgery, where there is a clear difference between success and failure. But in any profession where fraud is possible, the psychopath's successes in that field are likely to be fraudulent. The psychopath may be a "brilliant" Marxist law professor, who is supposedly showing that classical logic is a machination on the part of haves to oppress the havenots. But he is probably just blowing hot air. You'd see emptiness in grand claims if you were to read what he's saying instead of witnessing it in person and thus being pied-piped by his histrionics - his dramatic arm-movements, his melodic vocal modulations, his magisterially throwing a copy of The Wealth of Nations in the trashcan. Sometimes the psychopath professor may say truly brilliant things, but they are likely to be plagiarized. 
These points must be qualified. Psychopaths can be genuinely brilliant. But this qualification must itself be qualified! The qualification is aptly put by Lindner: 
In the literature on [psychopathy] frequent mention is made of the "high" intelligence of psychopaths However derived, these notions are misleading or at least insufficient to serve either as diagnostic aids or explanatory propositions So far as intelligence per se is concerned ... what is outstanding about psychopathy is not its arithmetic proportions but is its peculiar variety and design The intelligence of the psychopath can be described only adjectivally and in terms of the [psychopath's] whole

whose merits will go unrecognized for centuries, or great novels, which, for decades, only the critics like. The psychopath wants to dazzle people. He wants whatever gifts he has to be capable of being put on display at a moment's notice. 
284. Lindner (1944:5-6). 
The non-psychopath has a very different relationship to his talents. He'll inevitably spend time developing skills and acquiring knowledge that have intrinsic value but no display-value. The non-psychopath's talents are like a computer: the visible operations on one's desktop are but hints of the vastly more complex operations underlying them. The psychopath's talents are like a cubist painting: everything is pressed into a two-dimensional manifold. Everything is on the surface. 285 
8.6 That said, there is one respect in which psychopathy can facilitate the legitimate development of intelligence. The non-psychopath's cogitations make consciencebased concessions to standards of rigor and evidence. This tends to make him timid and unwilling to speculate. This leads to a fear of asserting things he can't substantiate, which leads to a fear of thinking such things: he is likely to be reluctant to embark on trains of thought that don't follow tried and truth pathways. 
Also, the non-psychopath, having as he does legitimate concern for others' well being, doesn't want to denigrate another person's viewpoint without having a legitimate reason to do so. This gives the non-psychopath another incentive to be 
<

Q A 
timid about stating, and subsequently about even thinking, anything for which he can't cite solid grounds. 286 
The psychopath isn't thus hobbled. So if the psychopath has intellectual talent, he isn't thus inhibited from working with ideas his confidence in which is based on nothing more than an obscure intuition. His willingness to countenance such ideas may lead to a willingness to have such ideas to begin with, the result being a loosening up of his creative powers that leads to ideas that sometimes have merit and that aren't likely to occur to others. 
So whereas the non-psychopath's intellectual search-space tends to be limited by considerations of plausibility and feasibility, the psychopath's search-space is limited by nothing other than his own brain-power. The result is that, if a given psychopath is intellectually gifted, he is likely to have some spectacular insights, albeit ones which, for the very reasons that he had them, he probably won't adequately substantiate and

I am not referring to the mercenary intellectual conformism of the pre-tenure professor or the pre-dissertation graduate student. I am referring to a conscience- based wish not to take credit away from those who deserve it. 
Of course, non-psychopaths do denigrate viewpoints they know to have merit; they

which, for those same reasons, are probably grossly outnumbered by unfounded speculations.287 
8.7 Like sociopaths, psychopaths are arch-rationalizers. In fact, setting aside directly perception-based beliefs and others of a comparably rudimentary kind, the psychopath's "beliefs" consists for the most part of rationalizations. This is subject to an important qualification. The psychopath can be a competent mathematician, philosopher, musician, or physician, and he can therefore have the beliefs necessary for such competence. But the psychopath's beliefs about himself are categorically in the nature of rationalizations; and the psychopath's beliefs about situations relating to his own welfare are unusually likely to be rationalizations, and oftentimes deeply implausible ones. 
The psychopath's having these characteristics is the result of the convergence of a few different forces. The psychopath sees nothing as having non-instrumental value

Psychopaths are as likely to vary in respect of intellectual acumen as the members of the top 45% of the non-psychopathic. (People not in the top 45% don't become psychopaths (or so it is alleged - doubtfully, in my view). See Cleckley 1941; Hare 1999.) It's hard to seem smart without being smart. And seeming smart to people who are themselves smart is typically more fruitful than seeming smart to intellectually deficient people: the former are more likely to be in positions of power. The more intelligent psychopaths know this, and they know that to seem smart to their highly intelligent superiors, they must actually be smart: in such cases, appearance and reality coalesce. So even though the psychopath cares only about appearance, not substance, there are cases where the two coincide. So if a psychopath solves the continuum problem, it isn't because he's only part-psychopath; it's because he knows he's at a juncture where there's no way to look a certain way without being that way, and it's his intention to look that way.

Because of a monsoon in East Asia, this merger will cause Company X/Y's stock to soar. For this reason, if were you now to invest $1,000 in that Company, you'd be a billionaire in ten years' time. But given the available data, there is no way you or anyone else could know this. 
It is logically impossible to predict what one will come to know; and, to the not inconsiderable extent that one's actions affect the world, it is therefore logically impossible to predict the future state of the universe. The forthcoming argument was put forth by Karl Popper (this is not a quotation): 
(KP288) You cannot possibly know exactly what you will know in 20 years. (We are setting aside obvious and trivial qualifications, e.g. if you know you'll be dead in 20 years, you know you'll know nothing.) Let ki...k be the pieces of knowledge of you'll have in 20 years; suppose that list to be complete. Suppose that you know now that in 20 years you'll know k1...k. In that case, you'll now know ki...k1. You'll inevitably acquire new knowledge over the next 20 years. So ki...k won't be the entirety of what you'll then know, contrary to our hypothesis. 
There is a corollary: What one knows affects what one does and therefore affects the world. Therefore, one can't know what one will do in 20 years or, therefore, exactly how the world will be then or later.

truthfulness itself. By being honest in furtherance of large-scale deceptions, the sociopath drains truthfulness of all value; and by being moral in furtherance of large- scale injustices, the sociopath drains morality of all meaning. The non-sociopathic liar-predator is merely saving his own skin; he isn't trying to undermine virtue itself. But that is what the sociopath is doing. 
An illustration: Jerry and Tricia work at a pharmacy. The pharmacy throws out medications that have reached their expiration-date, even though in most cases such medications are still effective. It's against the rules for employees to keep expired medications for themselves, even though they're going to be disposed of. Jerry's eight children all have strep throat. They need Cipro (a very strong antibiotic) or they'll die. Cipro retains its potency long after it has officially expired. Jerry keeps some expired Cipro for himself, intending to use it to save his children. Sally knows about this, and knows about his familial situation. She notifies the management as well as lawenforcement, knowing that Jerry will be fired, that his children will die, and that he'll serve a long jail-sentence for possession with intent to distribute. 
This is a textbook case of sociopathic pseudo-honesty. The distinctive nature of sociopathic treachery is to be understood in terms of three facts. 
(i) There is a gulf between official and actual morality, and between official and actual truth. 
<

Q A 
(ii) There are, tautologously, social incentives to endorse official morality and truth, and equally strong disincentives to endorse actual truth and morality, except when they coincide with their institutional counterparts. 
(iii) Institutional truth and morality are as obvious and unambiguous as their 
authentic counterparts are subtle and equivocal. 
Given (i), the sociopath and lie and predate while remaining on the right side of institutional truth and morality. Given (ii), the sociopath is rewarded, not penalized, for such lies and predations. Given (iii), the sociopath has no trouble convincing herself her lies and predations are acts of truthfulness and benevolence; and such rationalizations are made even easier by the just-mentioned fact that her chicanery is socially and consensually validated. 
It cannot be stressed that, when Tricia reports Jerry to the authorities, she doesn't fully know that what she is doing is malice-driven. She half-knows, but she also halfbelieves her own propaganda. Only a person with values can maintain a sharp mental distinction between actual truth and its surrogates - social truth (the fictions that reconcile people to the frustrations of having to live with others), emotional truth (the fictions that favorably disambiguate ambiguous and, properly disambiguated, intolerable facts about one's own person), and institutional truth (the fictions embodied in an institution's practices). Sociopaths and psychopaths are as good as others at distinguishing between true and false observation-reports (e.g. "that's red,”

There are many reasons why the sociopath doesn't really believe or disbelieve anything. We've already identified one: they have to strip their minds of the sensitivities on the basis of which all but but the most truths are known. But there are 
two other reasons. One is that sociopaths must believe that the truth is malleable. Even sociopaths (e.g. those who are "reborn" as members of cults with rigid belief- systems) have to believe that the facts conform to their wishes. Sociopaths have to believe that truth, morality, and merit are "relative" and a "matter of opinion." By countenancing the idea of a belief- and desire-transcendent reality, one is robbing one's rationalizations of their credibility. And that is not an option for someone, such as the sociopath, for whom there is no distinction between thought and 
rationalization. 
Sociopaths are seldom drawn to authors who advocate views that are well defined and unequivocal while at the same time not making concessions to people's emotional needs.

Q A 
In my experience, sociopathization is immediately preceded by a brief but extremely intense period of psychosis, which in turn is preceded by years of pretending that things were fine when they obviously weren't. Supposing arguendo that I was not dealing with singularities, these facts suggest that there is an element of psychosis in the sociopathy. There is a fact we haven't stated that confirms this suggestion. Even though, relative to the current state of science, schizoaffective disorder is not eliminable, the ingestion of a few pills - a few haldols or risperdals – leads to a speedy, if temporary, restoration of lucidity. Even during these brief intervals, lucidity isn't completely restored. But restoration is often sufficiently complete that there are few or no overt symptoms of their malady, provided that certain triggers are avoided. (Those triggers include sensitive topics of conversation and situations reminiscent of past traumas.) So there is a significant sense in which even the most severe psychoses are reversible; and they wouldn't be reversible if they were structural, as opposed to intra-structural. 
But sociopathy is never reversible. So assuming arguendo that I was not dealing with singularities, the pre-sociopath's psychosis comes to be embedded in the very structure of his psyche. Sociopathy is systemic psychosis, not system-internal psychosis. 
So far as the sociopath seems to be getting better, it's because he is getting worse: it's because he's absorbing into the swath of his sociopathy corrupted analogues of the

competence had been sociopathized. The apparent restoration of ability was really a diminution of it: her performance-related improvement reflected a competence- related deterioration. There is nothing that one loses upon sociopathizing that one will ever regain, except in the degraded form in which this individual regained her literary ability. 289 
289. Curiously, I've known several gifted writers who sociopathized. Most of them wrote nonfiction; two of them wrote fiction. Before sociopathizing, each one came to be a popular success, at which point it became lucrative for him to lie, and each one did. None would admit that he had sold out; each believed his own lies, thereby inaugurating his descent into sociopathy. 
Novel writing is no less of a sociopathogen than journalism, since novels are quite as capable as articles of being lies. Be it noted that there is a difference between a story and a lie. Stories are not ipso facto lies. Works of fiction are not necessarily lies. Crime and Punishment not a lie, even though it's fiction. Lying isn't just about what one is saying; it's also about how one is saying it. What the novelist is saying is different from how he is saying it; and, given how the two differ, the novelist is not lying, at least not solely by virtue of novelizing, even though he is deliberately transmitting non-truths. How he is saying it involves his asking the reader to entertain a hypothetical proposition. ("Suppose arguendo that there lived a man

As it is currently used, the word "criminal" is simply ambiguous. Sometimes it means lawbreaker. Sometimes it means career-criminal. Legal categories are of no scientific importance. So we'll use the word "criminal" to mean "career criminal." 
A criminal is not somebody who slips up once. He is somebody for whom crime is a way of life. 
The class of career-criminals comprises both psychopaths and non-psychopaths. But non-psychopathic criminals are psychodynamically much more like you and me than they are like psychopaths or sociopaths. So it will expedite discussion if we use the term "criminal" to denote the class of career criminals minus the psychopaths in that group. This way, the word "criminal" will denote an explanatorily unified 
category. 
A criminal is someone whose psychological architecture is intact, but whose object- relations with his fellow citizens is like a soldier's object-relations to enemy troops. The pilots responsible for detonating nuclear warheads over Hiroshima and Nagasaki were law-abiding and moral individuals. But their object-relations to the Japanese people had, in that context, been suspended: they saw the Japanese people, not as people, but as blips on a radar screen. 
Unlike the sociopath and psychopath, the criminal can and does have meaningful object-relations with others. The criminal really loves his wife; he has a best friend who he cares about; he's distressed by Junior's recent troubles at school. But when he

than they do theirs. Everyone is a writer. (To speak is to write: Were Socrates and Homer not writers?) Nobody wants his thoughts to be invalidated. But the professional writer has an extra incentive: by virtue of his career-choice, he is only as worthy as his thoughts. Therefore, the professional writer has an extra incentive to say things he doesn't believe, and he therefore has an incentive to believe such things, since he won't state them convincingly if he doesn't. But compositions can't undermine one another; the composer qua composer cannot step on anyone's toes. Composers can sell out: the erstwhile composers of string-quarters can write rock 'n' roll. But popular songs are not lies. It cannot be by lying that a composer popularizes his work, whereas it can be, and often is, by lying that a writer popularizes his work. 
Any practitioner of any craft can sociopathize and, more importantly, can do so by adulterating the way he plies his trade. But the craft of writing seems to be exceptionally sociopathogenic, because the very rationalizations that mediate sociopathization can be identical with one's work-product, whereas one's work- product as a composer or mathematician or food-purveyor, though certainly capable of precipitating sociopathogenesis, cannot themselves be the rationalizations involved in one's sociopathizing.

otherwise help; the psychiatrist who undermines his patient by represent the latter's rugged individualism as a pathological lack of "empathy"; the faux-savant who describes his sterility-driven pedantry as "rigor"; the junior employee who describes his toadyism as "respect for his superiors." 
The criminal is not such a person. This does not mean that the criminal is a good person. It means that he is an agent, unlike the sorts of people just described. The criminal's functioning as a criminal does involve his dehumanizing other people; it does involve him failing to have meaningful object-relations with people with whom a non-criminal (who wasn't either a sociopath or psychopath) would have such relations. To that extent, the criminal is like the psychopath. 
But there is a difference. The criminal can have meaningful object-relations. The psychopath cannot. The criminal must suspend his object-relations in order to ply his trade. The psychopath has none to suspend. The criminal is meaningfully connected to some people; and the ability to have such a connection presupposes the ability to have values; and it thus presupposes that one values the truth, since one must value the truth to value anything. So even if the criminal is meaningfully connected to but one other human being, his being able to have that connection means that he has values and thus has the psychological architecture needed to mediate value-driven ideation. This, in turn, means that he is an agent.

these points only to show that psychological theory must make some provisions for the phenomenon of evil separate from those that it makes or doesn't make, but should - for criminality, sociopathy, and psychopathy. 
Evil must be distinguished from hate. Everyone hates someone, but not everyone is evil. But the concept of evil must be understood in terms of that of hate. Evil is generalized, rigidified hate. So whereas your hatred is person-specific, its target being Jerry, Stalin's was not, its target being humanity itself. 
Wickedness and criminality are not mutually exclusive: only agents can be evil and only agents can be criminals, and a given agent can be both. 
Granting that the points just made about wickedness were not argued for, it is hoped that in this chapter we have shown that what was thought to be a single group that of the "anti-social" individual - consists of 5 distinct groups whose respective extensions are: psychopaths, sociopaths, criminals, people who are evil, and people who hate. And we have made some case that any given two of the first three categories are not just distinct, but mutually exclusive; which, if correct, warrants a considerable rethinking of many a shibboleth of contemporary psychology and criminology. 
291. Criminality is pragmatically driven selectivity in regards to object relations. Psychopathy is the withdrawl of object-relations at an early age. Sociopathy is the withdrawal of object relations after adulthood has been reached. (The "blanks” who I

discussed earlier did not read the developmental stage where they even had object- relations. So they were sub- or pre-psychopathic. This point was clearly stated and cogently defended by Morrison (2005), whose book, I feel, is undervalued.) Criminality is usually about economics: people deal drugs because they want to make money, not because they want to corrupt civilization. Of course, the life-styles they've chosen are more hospitable to the discharging of ill-will than are most non-criminal life-styles. So considerable wickedness comes to be implicated in the way that criminality is expressed. But criminality per se is different from wickedness. 
Conclusion 
There are two kinds of empiricism. There is the kind that restricts knowledge to sensebased knowledge, and there is the kind that restricts it to experience-based knowledge. The latter leads to idealism and thus to pan-mentalism. The former leads to behaviorism and thus to pan-non-mentalism. 
Both kinds demand the acceptance of constricted views of the mind. The one kind demands an infinitely constricted such conception: minds don't exist. The other grants the existence of consciousness but denies that there is anything to the mind 
besides consciousness. 
Behaviorism is just an aberration, which deserves no consideration. The other view, though less aberrant, is misconceived and erroneous. Misconceived, in that it fails to

Q A 
distinguish between access-consciousness and consciousness-proper. Erroneous, in that nothing other than content-transmitting ideation can constitute the genidentity of your pre- and post-sleep minds or can account for their qualitative similarities. 
There is no way to understand the concept of repression in strictly empiricist terms, the same being true of the concept of rationalization. These are definitional truths. Repressed ideation is by definition unconscious, and rationalizations by definition involve a bifurcation of mental activity into conscious and unconscious strata. What is unconscious is by definition what is unintrospectible. The unconscious, by definition, can be known only through inference, so far as it can be known at all. 
The hypothesis that there is unconscious mental activity is the ultimate deviation from the strictures of empiricism. But there is no way to explain conscious mental activity except on the assumption that there is unconscious mental activity. Hence the sterility of attempts to empiricize psychology and the erroneousness of attempts to identify the empiricization of psychology with the scientization of it. 
While making due allowances for the fact that psychological processes are braindependent, we have also established the coherence of the concepts forming the nucleus of at least one therapeutically and theoretically fecund attempt to understand the psychological realm on its own terms. To the extent that the points made in this work are not misguided, we have helped psychology begin to undo the damage that empiricism has done to it.
