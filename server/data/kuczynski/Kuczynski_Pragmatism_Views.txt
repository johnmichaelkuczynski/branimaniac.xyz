• VIEW 1: The meaning of a hypothesis lies in its observable consequences
  EVIDENCE: "(i) The meaning of a hypothesis-what it says about the world-lies in its observable consequences."

• VIEW 2: The relationship between a hypothesis and its observable consequences is contingent, not analytic
  EVIDENCE: "The reason is that the relationship between a hypothesis and its observable consequences is always contingent, never analytic, as it depends on what the operative conditions and causal mechanisms are."

• VIEW 3: Hypotheses and their observable consequences are not equivalent
  EVIDENCE: "So, H is observationally equivalent with (O) O1...On are the observable consequences of H only if certain conditions and certain mechanisms are operative. Given that different conditions and mechanisms might be operative, this means that H and O are not equivalent, observationally or otherwise."

• VIEW 4: One can accept a hypothesis and deny its observable consequences without contradiction
  EVIDENCE: "One could, without self-contradiction or incoherence, accept H and deny O^."

• VIEW 5: Hypotheses that are observationally equivalent due to natural law are not the same hypothesis
  EVIDENCE: "But does this mean that Q and Q* are the same hypothesis? No."

• VIEW 6: Observational equivalence due to natural law implies different claims about the world
  EVIDENCE: "First of all, given the fact that natural law is what guarantees their observational equivalence, it follows that they make different claims about the world."

• VIEW 7: Knowledge of physics is required to understand the observational equivalence of certain hypotheses
  EVIDENCE: "But one does have to know the laws of physics to know that Q and Q* are observationally equivalent, since they don't make the very same claim."

• VIEW 8: Observational equivalence only guarantees actual equivalence when it is analytic
  EVIDENCE: "In general, observational equivalence only guarantees actual equivalence when it is built into the very meanings of the claims in question-when, in other words, it is analytic in nature, as it is with H and H*."

• VIEW 9: Observational equivalence does not support the pragmatist's position when it is a consequence of meaning-equivalence
  EVIDENCE: "But in such cases, observational equivalence is a mere consequence of meaning-equivalence and therefore does not redound to the credit of the pragmatist's position."

• VIEW 10: Truth is a property of ideas that agree with reality
  EVIDENCE: "Truth, as any dictionary will tell you, is a property of certain of our ideas. It means their 'agreement,' as falsity means their disagreement, with 'reality.'"

• VIEW 11: Pragmatists and intellectualists accept the definition of truth as agreement with reality
  EVIDENCE: "Pragmatists and intellectualists both accept this definition as a matter of course."

• VIEW 12: Agreement with reality means being guided to or into working touch with it
  EVIDENCE: "To 'agree' in the widest sense with a reality, CAN ONLY MEAN TO BE GUIDED EITHER STRAIGHT UP TO IT OR INTO ITS SURROUNDINGS, OR TO BE PUT INTO SUCH WORKING TOUCH WITH IT AS TO HANDLE EITHER IT OR SOMETHING CONNECTED WITH IT BETTER THAN IF WE DISAGREED."

• VIEW 13: A true idea allows us to control the world
  EVIDENCE: "(ii) A true idea is one that allows us to control the world; a false one is one that doesn't."

• VIEW 14: James's definitions of pragmatism contain redundancies
  EVIDENCE: "This list contains some redundancies, as we will see."

• VIEW 15: Each of James's definitions of pragmatism is false but expresses legitimate insights about knowledge
  EVIDENCE: "We will find that each of (i)-(v) is false but that they are distorted ways of expressing a number of legitimate insights concerning knowledge and the acquisition thereof."

--- MAJOR VIEWS ---
1. VIEW: Truth is identical with usefulness
   EVIDENCE: "Given that truth is identical with usefulness"

2. VIEW: Ideas often gain in usefulness over time
   EVIDENCE: "given that ideas often gain in usefulness, rather than having a fixed quantity of usefulness that is present in them ab initio"

3. VIEW: Truth happens to an idea
   EVIDENCE: "it follows that 'truth' (i.e. usefulness) does indeed happen (i.e. accrue) to an idea"

4. VIEW: (iv*) is a corollary of the contention that truth is identical with usefulness
   EVIDENCE: "(iv*) merely registers a corollary of the contention that truth is identical with usefulness"

5. VIEW: (iv*) does not provide independent evidence for the contention that truth is identical with usefulness
   EVIDENCE: "(iv*) merely registers a corollary of the contention that truth is identical with usefulness and does not provide any independent evidence for it"

6. VIEW: (iv*) is refutable for the same reasons as (iii) and (iv)
   EVIDENCE: "And because (iv*) presupposes that truth is identical with usefulness, it is refutable for the same reasons as (iii) and (iv)"

7. VIEW: Truth is identical with usefulness and specific truths are instruments for organizing experience
   EVIDENCE: "Not only is truth identical with usefulness: specific truths are nothing other than instruments whose purpose is to help organize experience"

8. VIEW: James accepts that specific truths are instruments for organizing experience
   EVIDENCE: "There are several passages in Pragmatism that indicate that James accepts (iv^)"

9. VIEW: Categories like knife, army, rock, tree do not represent external realities but ways of organizing experience
   EVIDENCE: "the categories in terms of which we experience the world---knife, army, rock, tree, and possibly even persistent object---do not represent external realities but merely embody ways of organizing what would otherwise be an amorphous mass of experience"

10. VIEW: Truths constructed from categories are to be understood in instrumental terms
   EVIDENCE: "the 'truths' (for lack of a better term) that are constructed out of these categories are themselves to be understood in instrumental, as opposed to representational, terms"

11. VIEW: The property of being experience-organizing can be acquired over time by a 'truth'
   EVIDENCE: "given that the property of being experience-organizing can be acquired over time by a given 'truth' (so-called)"

12. VIEW: Truth is made, not discovered
   EVIDENCE: "Truth is made, not discovered"

13. VIEW: Knives, forks, nations, economies, and armies are not merely projective constructs
   EVIDENCE: "No-because a construct won't be useful unless it tracks objective realities"

14. VIEW: The blade and handle constitute a single object because they form a predictively robust ensemble
   EVIDENCE: "Because the blade and the knife constitute a predictively robust ensemble"

15. VIEW: Practical interests require that collective objects have causal and predictive integrity
   EVIDENCE: "those same practical interests wouldn't be well-served unless the collective thereby formed had a certain causal and predictive integrity"

16. VIEW: Grouping people into nations and armies and economies is useful because of their dynamic cohesiveness
   EVIDENCE: "the reason we find it useful to group people into nations and armies and economies; useful to group bricks into houses; useful to group stars into galaxies; is that such groups have a certain dynamic cohesiveness"

17. VIEW: Thermometers and scalpels are not merely 'useful fictions'
   EVIDENCE: "It is all very well to say that thermometers and scalpels are but 'useful fictions'-useful ways of grouping together qualia or events (or whatever it is you take to be indisputably real). But see how far you get without these so-called fictions"

18. VIEW: Economies and nations actually exist and are not just useful fictions
   EVIDENCE: "And see how far you get as an investor without assuming the actual existence of economies and nations"

19. VIEW: Useful constructs track actual causal mechanisms
   EVIDENCE: "The reason these 'fictions' are useful, it must be stressed, is that they track actual causal mechanisms"

20. VIEW: Nations, people, etc. exist derivatively of more fundamental entities
   EVIDENCE: "A better position is to say that nations, people, etc. exist, albeit derivatively of other, more fundamental entities"

21. VIEW: Pragmatism has tremendous value as a description of our knowledge and its acquisition
   EVIDENCE: "Pragmatism has tremendous value-as a description, not of truth per se, but of our knowledge of it-and, more precisely, of our acquisition of that knowledge."

22. VIEW: James' claim that 'Truth happens to an idea' is both opaque and false when taken literally
   EVIDENCE: "Taken literally, this is both opaque and false."

23. VIEW: Replacing 'truth' with 'the property of being knowledge' in James' claim makes it prima facie true
   EVIDENCE: "But replace 'truth' with 'the property of being knowledge.' This gives us: (iv+) Ideas acquire the property of being knowledge; i.e., they do not typically start out as knowledge, but they can become knowledge. Unlike (iv), which is prima facie false, (iv+) is prima facie true, at least where some beliefs are concerned."

24. VIEW: The author's belief that rabbits are herbivores did not constitute knowledge at age three
   EVIDENCE: "My belief that rabbits are herbivores did not constitute knowledge when, at the age of three, I first acquired it."

25. VIEW: The author's belief about rabbits became increasingly knowledge-constitutive over time
   EVIDENCE: "With the passage of time and the accumulation of experience, that acceptance became increasingly informed and justified and, for that reason, become increasingly knowledge-constitutive."

26. VIEW: Truth per se is discovered, not made
   EVIDENCE: "Truth per se is discovered, not made."

27. VIEW: Knowledge is made in the sense of generating beliefs that become knowledge
   EVIDENCE: "First, it involves the generation of the belief that, once it is sufficiently justified, becomes knowledge."

28. VIEW: Knowledge is made through a process of justification
   EVIDENCE: "Second, it involves the aforementioned process of justification."

29. VIEW: Beliefs become knowledge through a process of justification-construction
   EVIDENCE: "In general, beliefs become knowledge thanks to a process of justification-construction."

30. VIEW: Knowledge is acquired by being constructed
   EVIDENCE: "In a word: (v+) Knowledge is acquired by being constructed."

31. VIEW: The claim that true ideas are those that we can assimilate and false ones those we cannot is at best a half-truth
   EVIDENCE: "If taken literally, (iii) is at best a half-truth, given that there are highly assimilable false ideas and highly non-assimilable true ones."

32. VIEW: The pragmatist's claim that truth is assimilability and falsehood is non-assimilability is false
   EVIDENCE: "And as it is meant by the pragmatist, (iii) is identical with the outright falsehood that: (iii*) For an idea to be true is for it to be assimilable, and for an idea to be false is for it to be non-assimilable; i.e., truth is assimilability and falsehood is non-assimilability."

33. VIEW: Knowledge is assimilated truth, and beliefs become increasingly knowledge-constitutive as they become increasingly grounded
   EVIDENCE: "In any case, each of (iii) and (iii*) can be seen as an oblique way of expressing the truth that: (iii+) knowledge is assimilated truth, and beliefs become increasingly knowledge- constitutive as become increasingly grounded."

34. VIEW: The claim that a true idea is one that allows us to control the world is incorrect
   EVIDENCE: "But what (ii) incorrectly represents as a virtue of truth itself, (ii+) correctly represents as a virtue of our knowledge of it."

35. VIEW: Instances of knowledge are ipso facto empowering
   EVIDENCE: "(ii+) Instances of knowledge are ipso facto empowering."

36. VIEW: Truths are useless unless known
   EVIDENCE: "But they are useless unless known-which shows that the property of being power-enhancing belongs not to those truths per se, but to our knowledge of them."

37. VIEW: It is knowledge, not truth, that is empowering
   EVIDENCE: "In other words, it isn't truth that is empowering: it is knowledge."

38. VIEW: The pragmatist's claim that truth is ipso facto empowering is false
   EVIDENCE: "The false claim, urged by the pragmatist, that the truth is ipso facto empowering corresponds to the true one that knowledge is empowering."

39. VIEW: The meaning of a hypothesis lies in its observable consequences is false
   EVIDENCE: "(I) is false, as we saw, since the observable consequences of a given hypothesis are the vector sum both of what that hypothesis says about world and of the subject's relationship to the alleged reality being described."

40. VIEW: Our knowledge of the veracity of a hypothesis is based on its observable consequences
   EVIDENCE: "But (i) parallels the true (albeit utterly truistic) claim that: (i+) Our knowledge of the veracity of a given hypothesis is based on its observable consequences."

41. VIEW: Claims (i)-(v) are ways of combatting an 'intellectualist' conception of knowledge
   EVIDENCE: "What (i)-(v) have in common is that they are ways of combatting an 'intellectualist' conception of knowledge and of replacing it with an 'interactionist' or 'operationalist' conception of it."

42. VIEW: Claims (i)-(v) replace an object-oriented conception of knowledge with an agent-oriented conception
   EVIDENCE: "To make a similar, though perhaps non-coincident point, (i)-(v) replace an object-oriented conception of knowledge with a subject-oriented-or, better, an agent-oriented-conception of knowledge."

43. VIEW: The negations of claims (i)-(v) are correct
   EVIDENCE: "Each of (iN)-( vN) is correct, as we have seen."

44. VIEW: The negations of claims (i)-(v) suggest that knowledge-acquisition is about passively taking in what is out there
   EVIDENCE: "But what they suggest (not what they not imply, be it noted, but merely suggest, albeit strongly) is that knowledge-acquisition is about passively taking in what is out there and therefore doing as little as possible to disrupt it."

45. VIEW: Classical Epistemology posits that knowledge-acquisition is about taking note of what exists and doing as little as possible to change it
   EVIDENCE: "Developed further, the idea that James is concerned to refute would be as follows ('CE' stands for 'Classical Epistemology'): (CE) Knowledge-acquisition is about taking note of what exists and therefore doing as little as possible to change it."

46. VIEW: Actions are mere precursors to having observations
   EVIDENCE: "actions are mere precursors to the having of the observations in question."

47. VIEW: The scientific process begins with passive observation
   EVIDENCE: "the scientific process proper only begins when passive observation begins and, therefore, when action ends."

48. VIEW: CE may be true in a narrow, technical sense
   EVIDENCE: "CE may well be true in some narrow, technical sense."

49. VIEW: Intellectual discoveries are made by solving practical problems
   EVIDENCE: "intellectual discoveries are made by solving practical problems."

50. VIEW: Much of physics is fallout from attempts to create better weapons and dams
   EVIDENCE: "Much of physics is the fallout of attempts to create better weapons and dams and the like."

51. VIEW: Economics was invented to manage wealth from the New World
   EVIDENCE: "Economics was invented as a way of managing the enormous influx into Europe of wealth from the New World."

52. VIEW: Anthropology was invented to help Europeans understand and interact with natives
   EVIDENCE: "Anthropology was invented to help Europeans understand, and interactive more productively with, the natives of the lands they were colonizing."

53. VIEW: Psychoanalysis was developed to solve psychiatric problems
   EVIDENCE: "Psychoanalysis was developed in order to solve otherwise unsolvable psychiatric problems."

54. VIEW: Modern epistemology came into existence in the mid-1600s
   EVIDENCE: "When did modern epistemology come into existence? In the mid-1600s."

55. VIEW: Modern physics and engineering came into existence around the same time as modern epistemology
   EVIDENCE: "When did modern physics and engineering come into existence? About the same time."

56. VIEW: Church doctrines lost credibility around the same time as the rise of modern science
   EVIDENCE: "When did Church doctrines lose credibility? About the same time, the reason being they were interfering scientific progress."

57. VIEW: Philosophers had to develop new epistemologies due to the loss of faith-based epistemology
   EVIDENCE: "With faith-based epistemology (if there even is such a thing) no longer possible, philosophers had to come up with new, non-dogmatic-or even anti- dogmatic-epistemologies."

58. VIEW: The discipline of logic began in the mid-1800s with George Boole
   EVIDENCE: "the discipline of logic began in the mid-1800s, with the work of George Boole."

59. VIEW: George Boole's objective was to automate reasoning
   EVIDENCE: "whose objective was to automate reasoning."

60. VIEW: The automation of logic coincided with the automation of physical production
   EVIDENCE: "This happened at precisely the time that much physical production was being automated."

61. VIEW: 'Purely theoretical' problems relate to the coherence of discoveries made in solving practical problems
   EVIDENCE: "They are problems relating to the mutual coherence of discoveries made in the course of solving actual, practical problems."

62. VIEW: Calculus was invented to compute planetary orbits and ballistics
   EVIDENCE: "Calculus was invented to compute planetary orbits and other ballistics-related problems."

63. VIEW: 'Purely theoretical' problems like infinitesimals and fractals were needed to validate useful belief-systems
   EVIDENCE: "But the only reason these 'purely theoretical' problems were seen as being worth solving is that they were needed to validate an enormously useful belief-system."

64. VIEW: 'Purely theoretical' knowledge tends to be stale and one-dimensional
   EVIDENCE: "A corollary is that 'purely theoretical' knowledge, so far as there is such a thing, tends to be stale and one-dimensional."

65. VIEW: Book knowledge of finance principles was useless in practical business
   EVIDENCE: "But when I went into business, my 'book knowledge' of those principles proved useless."

66. VIEW: 'Pure theory' concerns itself with mere schemata
   EVIDENCE: "In general, there is a tendency for 'pure theory' to concern itself with mere schemata."

67. VIEW: Ideas are true because they are useful, according to James
   EVIDENCE: "According to James, ideas are true because they are useful, not the other way around."

68. VIEW: Theorems of trigonometry are useful because they are true
   EVIDENCE: "The theorems of trigonometry are useful because they are true, not the other way around."

69. VIEW: Truths are learned because they are useful
   EVIDENCE: "What is true is that truths are learned-and are worth learning---because they are useful."

70. VIEW: Theoretical knowledge should be anchored in practical knowledge
   EVIDENCE: "It should exist as long as it is anchored in practical knowledge."

71. VIEW: When theoretical knowledge is not anchored in practical knowledge, it degenerates
   EVIDENCE: "When it ceases to be so anchored, it degenerates into knowledge of empty formalisms or assumes some otherwise degraded form."

72. VIEW: It is absurd to identify the true with the useful
   EVIDENCE: "So, while it is absurd to identify the true with the useful."

73. VIEW: It is not absurd to identify the true as worth learning with the useful
   EVIDENCE: "it is not absurd to so identify the true in so far as it is worth learning."

74. VIEW: Truth is objective
   EVIDENCE: "Technically, truth is objective."

75. VIEW: Knowledge is a relationship between subject and object
   EVIDENCE: "But knowledge is a relationship between subject and object-between mind and world-and there is therefore a subjective side to it."

76. VIEW: The intellect exists to help the organism survive and procreate
   EVIDENCE: "And, speaking biologically, the intellect (i.e., the ability to acquire and organize knowledge) exists to help the organism survive and procreate."

77. VIEW: In human beings, intellect has become autonomous to some extent
   EVIDENCE: "In human beings, intellect has to some extent become autonomous."

78. VIEW: The applied mathematician is interested in mathematical relations for their practical applications
   EVIDENCE: "The applied mathematician is interested in relations among numbers and other mathematical objects because of their possible practical applications."

79. VIEW: The pure mathematician is interested in mathematical relations for their own sake
   EVIDENCE: "The pure mathematician is interested in those relations 'for their own sake'."

80. VIEW: The pure mathematician's objective is to learn more about mathematical relations
   EVIDENCE: "his objective is not to use them, but simply to learn more about them."

81. VIEW: The philosopher is interested in ethical truths for their own sake
   EVIDENCE: "The philosopher is interested in ethical truths 'for their own sake'."

82. VIEW: The jurist is interested in ethical truths for their practical applications
   EVIDENCE: "whereas the jurist his interested in them in them because of their practical applications."

83. VIEW: The philosopher investigates coherence-relations internal to a dataset of interest due to practical applications
   EVIDENCE: "But the philosopher is investigating coherence-relations internal to a dataset that is of interest only because of its practical applications."

84. VIEW: The same principle applies to other branches of philosophy
   EVIDENCE: "Much the same is true---so I would suggest, though I cannot prove it here-of the other branches of philosopher."

85. VIEW: The theoretician is to the practitioner what the martial artist is to the soldier
   EVIDENCE: "the idea being that theoretician is to the practitioner what the martial artist is to the soldier."

86. VIEW: The practitioner determines what the theoretician studies
   EVIDENCE: "it is the practitioner who determines both what the theoretician is studying"

87. VIEW: The practitioner determines the general lines along which the theoretician studies
   EVIDENCE: "it is the practitioner who determines... the general lines along which he studies it."

88. VIEW: The points about theoreticians and practitioners hold equally for artistic endeavor
   EVIDENCE: "I would suggest that these points hold equally of artistic endeavor."

89. VIEW: The artist organizes matter
   EVIDENCE: "Like the engineer, the artist organizes matter (paint, marble, sound, etc.)."

90. VIEW: The engineer is interested in relations among material objects because of their possible practical applications
   EVIDENCE: "whereas the engineer is interested in relations among material objects because of their possible practical applications"

91. VIEW: The artist is interested in relations among material objects 'for their own sake'
   EVIDENCE: "the artist is interested in them 'for their own sake'."

92. VIEW: The artist is interested in deepening his understanding of relations among material objects
   EVIDENCE: "he is interested either in deepening his understanding of those relations"

93. VIEW: The artist is interested in exercising his ability to understand relations among material objects
   EVIDENCE: "or in exercising his ability to understand them."

94. VIEW: The artist appears to have turned his back on reality
   EVIDENCE: "the artist appears to have turned his back on reality"

95. VIEW: The artist is exercising his ability to engage reality
   EVIDENCE: "because he is exercising his ability to engage it"

96. VIEW: The same holds for the theoretician as for the artist in terms of engaging reality
   EVIDENCE: "with the much the same holding of the theoretician."

97. VIEW: Interest in truth or beauty 'for their own sake' is not directly concerned with practical results
   EVIDENCE: "what we refer to as interest in truth or beauty 'for their own sake', though not directly concerned with practical results"

98. VIEW: Interest in truth or beauty 'for their own sake' is directly concerned with the cognitive basis of our ability to generate practical results
   EVIDENCE: "is directly concerned with the cognitive basis of our ability to generate practical results"

99. VIEW: James' thesis that truth is utility is false
   EVIDENCE: "James' thesis that truth is utility, though itself false"
