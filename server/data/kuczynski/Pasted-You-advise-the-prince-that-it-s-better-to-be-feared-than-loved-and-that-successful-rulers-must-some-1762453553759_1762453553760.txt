You advise the prince that it's better to be feared than loved, and that successful rulers must sometimes act with cruelty and deception. Are you describing how politics actually works, or are you saying this is how princes should behave? Do you believe there's no place for morality in statecraft, or are you simply being realistic about the necessities of political power?"

I observed in Florence that politics is inherently amoral, and the prince must act according to the necessities of power rather than abstract moral ideals. My intention is to describe the reality of political life, where human nature is selfish and driven by self-interest. Thus, the prince must sometimes employ cruelty and deception to maintain control and stability. As I have noted, "it is much safer to be feared than loved, if one has to lack one of the two." This is not an endorsement of immorality, but a recognition that in the political arena, the end often justifies the means. A prince who understands this truth will navigate the complexities of governance with pragmatism, ensuring the security and prosperity of his state. Therefore, my counsel is grounded in the realities of power, where virtù must be applied to counter the whims of fortuna.

 THE MACHIEVELLI BOT IS SHIT. BARELY TRUE TO HIS OWN WRITING; AND COGNITIVELY WEAK. HE DOESN'T ANSWER TEH QEUSTION. ALWAYS MAKE SURE TEH FUCKING BOT ANSWERS THE QUESTION AND DOESN'T JUST USER THE QUESTION A  The app is pattern-matching to "Machiavelli question" → retrieve standard talking points: "better feared than loved," "end justifies means," "virtù and fortuna," "pragmatism vs. morality."
It's NOT actually parsing what the question ASKS (descriptive vs. normative? no place for morality vs. realistic necessities?) and responding to THAT.
It's like a politician pivoting to their prepared remarks regardless of what's asked.
The fix: App needs to:

Parse the specific logical structure of the question
Identify what aspect of the thinker's position is being probed
Answer THAT, not just dump generic position statements

Same problem you identified with Kant ignoring "follows from analytic principles" and just restating "arithmetic is synthetic."
The app needs to be surgically responsive to the actual question, not just thematically associated with it.
This is the core problem you're trying to fix with the "address the logic of the question" protocol.
