PREFACE 


The 
Russian 
Revolution 
is 
one 
of 
the 
great 
heroic 
events 
of 
the 
world's 
history. 
It 
is 
natural 
to 
compare 
it 
to 
the 
French 
Revolution, 
but 
it 
is 
in 
fact 
something 
of 
even 
more 
importance. 
It 
does 
more 
to 
change 
daily 
life 
and 
the 
structure 
of 
society: 
it 
also 
does 
more 
to 
change 
men's 
beliefs. 
The 
difference 
is 
exemplified 
by 
the 
difference 
between 
Marx 
and 
Rousseau: 
the 
latter 
sentimental 
and 
soft, 
appealing 
to 
emotion, 
obliterating 
sharp 
outlines; 
the 
former 
systematic 
like 
Hegel, 
full 
of 
hard 
intellectual 
content, 
appealing 
to 
historic 
necessity 
and 
the 
technical 
development 
of 
industry, 
suggesting 
a 
view 
of 
human 
beings 
as 
puppets 
in 
the 
grip 
of 
omnipotent 
material 
forces. 
Bolshevism 
combines 
the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution 
with 
those 
of 
the 
rise 
of 
Islam; 
and 
the 
result 
is 
something 
radically 
new, 
which 
can 
only 
be 
understood 
by 
a 
patient 
and 
passionate 
effort 
of 
imagination. 


Before 
entering 
upon 
any 
detail, 
I 
wish 
to 
state, 
as 
clearly 
and 
unambiguously 
as 
I 
can, 
my 
own 
attitude 
towards 
this 
new 
thing. 


By 
far 
the 
most 
important 
aspect 
of 
the 
Russian 
Revolution 
is 
as 
an 
attempt 
to 
realize 
Communism. 
I 
believe 
that 
Communism 
is 
necessary 
to 
the 
world, 
and 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
heroism 
of 
Russia 
has 
fired 
men's 
hopes 
in 
a 
way 
which 
was 
essential 
to 
the 
realization 
of 
Communism 
in 
the 
future. 
Regarded 
as 
a 
splendid 
attempt, 
without 
which 
ultimate 
success 
would 
have 
been 
very 
improbable, 
Bolshevism 
deserves 
the 
gratitude 
and 
admiration 
of 
all 
the 



progressive 
part 
of 
mankind. 


But 
the 
method 
by 
which 
Moscow 
aims 
at 
establishing 
Communism 
is 
a 
pioneer 
method, 
rough 
and 
dangerous, 
too 
heroic 
to 
count 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
opposition 
it 
arouses. 
I 
do 
not 
believe 
that 
by 
this 
method 
a 
stable 
or 
desirable 
form 
of 
Communism 
can 
be 
established. 
Three 
issues 
seem 
to 
me 
possible 
from 
the 
present 
situation. 
The 
first 
is 
the 
ultimate 
defeat 
of 
Bolshevism 
by 
the 
forces 
of 
capitalism. 
The 
second 
is 
the 
victory 
of 
the 
Bolshevists 
accompanied 
by 
a 
complete 
loss 
of 
their 
ideals 
and 
a 
régime 
of 
Napoleonic 
imperialism. 
The 
third 
is 
a 
prolonged 
world-war, 
in 
which 
civilization 
will 
go 
under, 
and 
all 
its 
manifestations 
(including 
Communism) 
will 
be 
forgotten. 


It 
is 
because 
I 
do 
not 
believe 
that 
the 
methods 
of 
the 
Third 
International 
can 
lead 
to 
the 
desired 
goal 
that 
I 
have 
thought 
it 
worth 
while 
to 
point 
out 
what 
seem 
to 
me 
undesirable 
features 
in 
the 
present 
state 
of 
Russia. 
I 
think 
there 
are 
lessons 
to 
be 
learnt 
which 
must 
be 
learnt 
if 
the 
world 
is 
ever 
to 
achieve 
what 
is 
desired 
by 
those 
in 
the 
West 
who 
have 
sympathy 
with 
the 
original 
aims 
of 
the 
Bolsheviks. 
I 
do 
not 
think 
these 
lessons 
can 
be 
learnt 
except 
by 
facing 
frankly 
and 
fully 
whatever 
elements 
of 
failure 
there 
are 
in 
Russia. 
I 
think 
these 
elements 
of 
failure 
are 
less 
attributable 
to 
faults 
of 
detail 
than 
to 
an 
impatient 
philosophy, 
which 
aims 
at 
creating 
a 
new 
world 
without 
sufficient 
preparation 
in 
the 
opinions 
and 
feelings 
of 
ordinary 
men 
and 
women. 


But 
although 
I 
do 
not 
believe 
that 
Communism 
can 
be 
realized 
immediately 
by 
the 
spread 
of 
Bolshevism, 
I 
do 
believe 
that, 
if 
Bolshevism 
falls, 
it 
will 
have 
contributed 
a 
legend 
and 
a 
heroic 
attempt 
without 
which 
ultimate 
success 
might 
never 
have 
come. 
A 
fundamental 
economic 
reconstruction, 
bringing 
with 
it 
very 
far-reaching 
changes 
in 
ways 
of 
thinking 
and 
feeling, 
in 
philosophy 
and 
art 
and 
private 
relations, 
seems 
absolutely 
necessary 
if 
industrialism 
is 
to 
become 
the 
servant 
of 
man 
instead 
of 
his 
master. 
In 
all 
this, 
I 
am 
at 
one 
with 
the 
Bolsheviks; 
politically, 
I 
criticize 
them 
only 
when 
their 
methods 
seem 
to 
involve 
a 
departure 
from 
their 
own 
ideals. 


There 
is, 
however, 
another 
aspect 
of 
Bolshevism 
from 
which 
I 
differ 
more 
fundamentally. 
Bolshevism 
is 
not 
merely 
a 
political 
doctrine; 
it 
is 
also 
a 
religion, 
with 
elaborate 
dogmas 
and 
inspired 
scriptures. 
When 
Lenin 
wishes 
to 
prove 
some 
proposition, 
he 
does 
so, 
if 
possible, 
by 
quoting 
texts 
from 
Marx 
and 
Engels. 
A 
full-fledged 
Communist 
is 
not 
merely 
a 
man 
who 
believes 
that 
land 
and 
capital 
should 
be 
held 
in 
common, 
and 
their 



produce 
distributed 
as 
nearly 
equally 
as 
possible. 
He 
is 
a 
man 
who 
entertains 
a 
number 
of 
elaborate 
and 
dogmatic 
beliefs--such 
as 
philosophic 
materialism, 
for 
example--which 
may 
be 
true, 
but 
are 
not, 
to 
a 
scientific 
temper, 
capable 
of 
being 
known 
to 
be 
true 
with 
any 
certainty. 
This 
habit, 
of 
militant 
certainty 
about 
objectively 
doubtful 
matters, 
is 
one 
from 
which, 
since 
the 
Renaissance, 
the 
world 
has 
been 
gradually 
emerging, 
into 
that 
temper 
of 
constructive 
and 
fruitful 
scepticism 
which 
constitutes 
the 
scientific 
outlook. 
I 
believe 
the 
scientific 
outlook 
to 
be 
immeasurably 
important 
to 
the 
human 
race. 
If 
a 
more 
just 
economic 
system 
were 
only 
attainable 
by 
closing 
men's 
minds 
against 
free 
inquiry, 
and 
plunging 
them 
back 
into 
the 
intellectual 
prison 
of 
the 
middle 
ages, 
I 
should 
consider 
the 
price 
too 
high. 
It 
cannot 
be 
denied 
that, 
over 
any 
short 
period 
of 
time, 
dogmatic 
belief 
is 
a 
help 
in 
fighting. 
If 
all 
Communists 
become 
religious 
fanatics, 
while 
supporters 
of 
capitalism 
retain 
a 
sceptical 
temper, 
it 
may 
be 
assumed 
that 
the 
Communists 
will 
win, 
while 
in 
the 
contrary 
case 
the 
capitalists 
would 
win. 
It 
seems 
evident, 
from 
the 
attitude 
of 
the 
capitalist 
world 
to 
Soviet 
Russia, 
of 
the 
Entente 
to 
the 
Central 
Empires, 
and 
of 
England 
to 
Ireland 
and 
India, 
that 
there 
is 
no 
depth 
of 
cruelty, 
perfidy 
or 
brutality 
from 
which 
the 
present 
holders 
of 
power 
will 
shrink 
when 
they 
feel 
themselves 
threatened. 
If, 
in 
order 
to 
oust 
them, 
nothing 
short 
of 
religious 
fanaticism 
will 
serve, 
it 
is 
they 
who 
are 
the 
prime 
sources 
of 
the 
resultant 
evil. 
And 
it 
is 
permissible 
to 
hope 
that, 
when 
they 
have 
been 
dispossessed, 
fanaticism 
will 
fade, 
as 
other 
fanaticisms 
have 
faded 
in 
the 
past. 


The 
present 
holders 
of 
power 
are 
evil 
men, 
and 
the 
present 
manner 
of 
life 
is 
doomed. 
To 
make 
the 
transition 
with 
a 
minimum 
of 
bloodshed, 
with 
a 
maximum 
of 
preservation 
of 
whatever 
has 
value 
in 
our 
existing 
civilization, 
is 
a 
difficult 
problem. 
It 
is 
this 
problem 
which 
has 
chiefly 
occupied 
my 
mind 
in 
writing 
the 
following 
pages. 
I 
wish 
I 
could 
think 
that 
its 
solution 
would 
be 
facilitated 
by 
some 
slight 
degree 
of 
moderation 
and 
humane 
feeling 
on 
the 
part 
of 
those 
who 
enjoy 
unjust 
privileges 
in 
the 
world 
as 
it 
is. 


The 
present 
work 
is 
the 
outcome 
of 
a 
visit 
to 
Russia, 
supplemented 
by 
much 
reading 
and 
discussion 
both 
before 
and 
after. 
I 
have 
thought 
it 
best 
to 
record 
what 
I 
saw 
separately 
from 
theoretical 
considerations, 
and 
I 
have 
endeavoured 
to 
state 
my 
impressions 
without 
any 
bias 
for 
or 
against 
the 
Bolsheviks. 
I 
received 
at 
their 
hands 
the 
greatest 
kindness 
and 
courtesy, 
and 
I 
owe 
them 
a 
debt 
of 
gratitude 
for 
the 
perfect 
freedom 
which 
they 
allowed 
me 
in 
my 
investigations. 
I 
am 
conscious 
that 
I 
was 
too 
short 
a 
time 
in 
Russia 
to 



be 
able 
to 
form 
really 
reliable 
judgments; 
however, 
I 
share 
this 
drawback 
with 
most 
other 
westerners 
who 
have 
written 
on 
Russia 
since 
the 
October 
Revolution. 
I 
feel 
that 
Bolshevism 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
such 
importance 
that 
it 
is 
necessary, 
for 
almost 
every 
political 
question, 
to 
define 
one's 
attitude 
in 
regard 
to 
it; 
and 
I 
have 
hopes 
that 
I 
may 
help 
others 
to 
define 
their 
attitude, 
even 
if 
only 
by 
way 
of 
opposition 
to 
what 
I 
have 
written. 


I 
have 
received 
invaluable 
assistance 
from 
my 
secretary, 
Miss 
D.W. 
Black, 
who 
was 
in 
Russia 
shortly 
after 
I 
had 
left. 
The 
chapter 
on 
Art 
and 
Education 
is 
written 
by 
her 
throughout. 
Neither 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
other's 
opinions.

PART 
I 
THE 
PRESENT 
CONDITION 
OF 
RUSSIA 

WHAT 
IS 
HOPED 
FROM 
BOLSHEVISM 


To 
understand 
Bolshevism 
it 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
know 
facts; 
it 
is 
necessary 
also 
to 
enter 
with 
sympathy 
or 
imagination 
into 
a 
new 
spirit. 
The 
chief 
thing 
that 
the 
Bolsheviks 
have 
done 
is 
to 
create 
a 
hope, 
or 
at 
any 
rate 
to 
make 
strong 
and 
widespread 
a 
hope 
which 
was 
formerly 
confined 
to 
a 
few. 
This 
aspect 
of 
the 
movement 
is 
as 
easy 
to 
grasp 
at 
a 
distance 
as 
it 
is 
in 
Russia--perhaps 
even 
easier, 
because 
in 
Russia 
present 
circumstances 
tend 
to 
obscure 
the 
view 
of 
the 
distant 
future. 
But 
the 
actual 
situation 
in 
Russia 
can 
only 
be 
understood 
superficially 
if 
we 
forget 
the 
hope 
which 
is 
the 
motive 
power 
of 
the 
whole. 
One 
might 
as 
well 
describe 
the 
Thebaid 
without 
mentioning 
that 
the 
hermits 
expected 
eternal 
bliss 
as 
the 
reward 
of 
their 
sacrifices 
here 
on 
earth. 


I 
cannot 
share 
the 
hopes 
of 
the 
Bolsheviks 
any 
more 
than 
those 
of 
the 
Egyptian 
anchorites; 
I 
regard 
both 
as 
tragic 
delusions, 
destined 
to 
bring 
upon 
the 
world 
centuries 
of 
darkness 
and 
futile 
violence. 
The 
principles 
of 
the 
Sermon 
on 
the 
Mount 
are 
admirable, 
but 
their 
effect 
upon 
average 
human 
nature 
was 
very 
different 
from 
what 
was 
intended. 
Those 
who 
followed 
Christ 
did 
not 
learn 
to 
love 
their 
enemies 
or 
to 
turn 
the 
other 
cheek. 
They 
learned 
instead 
to 
use 
the 
Inquisition 
and 
the 
stake, 
to 
subject 
the 
human 
intellect 
to 
the 
yoke 
of 
an 
ignorant 
and 
intolerant 
priesthood, 
to 
degrade 
art 
and 
extinguish 
science 
for 
a 
thousand 
years. 
These 
were 
the 
inevitable 
results, 
not 
of 
the 
teaching, 
but 
of 
fanatical 
belief 
in 
the 
teaching. 
The 
hopes 
which 
inspire 
Communism 
are, 
in 
the 
main, 
as 
admirable 
as 
those 
instilled 
by 
the 
Sermon 
on 
the 
Mount, 
but 
they 
are 
held 
as 
fanatically, 
and 
are 
likely 
to 
do 
as 
much 
harm. 
Cruelty 
lurks 
in 
our 
instincts, 
and 
fanaticism 
is 
a 
camouflage 
for 
cruelty. 
Fanatics 
are 
seldom 
genuinely 
humane, 
and 
those 
who 
sincerely 
dread 
cruelty 
will 
be 
slow 
to 
adopt 
a 
fanatical 
creed. 
I 
do 
not 
know 
whether 
Bolshevism 
can 
be 
prevented 
from 
acquiring 
universal 
power. 
But 
even 
if 
it 
cannot, 
I 
am 
persuaded 
that 
those 
who 
stand 
out 
against 
it, 
not 
from 
love 
of 
ancient 
injustice, 
but 
in 
the 
name 
of 
the 
free 
spirit 
of 
Man, 
will 
be 
the 
bearers 
of 
the 
seeds 
of 
progress, 
from 
which, 
when 
the 
world's 
gestation 
is 
accomplished, 
new 
life 
will 
be 
born. 


The 
war 
has 
left 
throughout 
Europe 
a 
mood 
of 
disillusionment 
and 
despair 
which 
calls 
aloud 
for 
a 
new 
religion, 
as 
the 
only 
force 
capable 
of 
giving 
men 
the 
energy 
to 
live 
vigorously. 
Bolshevism 
has 
supplied 
the 
new 
religion. 
It 
promises 
glorious 
things: 
an 
end 
of 
the 
injustice 
of 
rich 
and 
poor, 



an 
end 
of 
economic 
slavery, 
an 
end 
of 
war. 
It 
promises 
an 
end 
of 
the 
disunion 
of 
classes 
which 
poisons 
political 
life 
and 
threatens 
our 
industrial 
system 
with 
destruction. 
It 
promises 
an 
end 
to 
commercialism, 
that 
subtle 
falsehood 
that 
leads 
men 
to 
appraise 
everything 
by 
its 
money 
value, 
and 
to 
determine 
money 
value 
often 
merely 
by 
the 
caprices 
of 
idle 
plutocrats. 
It 
promises 
a 
world 
where 
all 
men 
and 
women 
shall 
be 
kept 
sane 
by 
work, 
and 
where 
all 
work 
shall 
be 
of 
value 
to 
the 
community, 
not 
only 
to 
a 
few 
wealthy 
vampires. 
It 
is 
to 
sweep 
away 
listlessness 
and 
pessimism 
and 
weariness 
and 
all 
the 
complicated 
miseries 
of 
those 
whose 
circumstances 
allow 
idleness 
and 
whose 
energies 
are 
not 
sufficient 
to 
force 
activity. 
In 
place 
of 
palaces 
and 
hovels, 
futile 
vice 
and 
useless 
misery, 
there 
is 
to 
be 
wholesome 
work, 
enough 
but 
not 
too 
much, 
all 
of 
it 
useful, 
performed 
by 
men 
and 
women 
who 
have 
no 
time 
for 
pessimism 
and 
no 
occasion 
for 
despair. 


The 
existing 
capitalist 
system 
is 
doomed. 
Its 
injustice 
is 
so 
glaring 
that 
only 
ignorance 
and 
tradition 
could 
lead 
wage-earners 
to 
tolerate 
it. 
As 
ignorance 
diminishes, 
tradition 
becomes 
weakened, 
and 
the 
war 
destroyed 
the 
hold 
upon 
men's 
minds 
of 
everything 
merely 
traditional. 
It 
may 
be 
that, 
through 
the 
influence 
of 
America, 
the 
capitalist 
system 
will 
linger 
for 
another 
fifty 
years; 
but 
it 
will 
grow 
continually 
weaker, 
and 
can 
never 
recover 
the 
position 
of 
easy 
dominance 
which 
it 
held 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
century. 
To 
attempt 
to 
bolster 
it 
up 
is 
a 
useless 
diversion 
of 
energies 
which 
might 
be 
expended 
upon 
building 
something 
new. 
Whether 
the 
new 
thing 
will 
be 
Bolshevism 
or 
something 
else, 
I 
do 
not 
know; 
whether 
it 
will 
be 
better 
or 
worse 
than 
capitalism, 
I 
do 
not 
know. 
But 
that 
a 
radically 
new 
order 
of 
society 
will 
emerge, 
I 
feel 
no 
doubt. 
And 
I 
also 
feel 
no 
doubt 
that 
the 
new 
order 
will 
be 
either 
some 
form 
of 
Socialism 
or 
a 
reversion 
to 
barbarism 
and 
petty 
war 
such 
as 
occurred 
during 
the 
barbarian 
invasion. 
If 
Bolshevism 
remains 
the 
only 
vigorous 
and 
effective 
competitor 
of 
capitalism, 
I 
believe 
that 
no 
form 
of 
Socialism 
will 
be 
realized, 
but 
only 
chaos 
and 
destruction. 
This 
belief, 
for 
which 
I 
shall 
give 
reasons 
later, 
is 
one 
of 
the 
grounds 
upon 
which 
I 
oppose 
Bolshevism. 
But 
to 
oppose 
it 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
a 
supporter 
of 
capitalism 
would 
be, 
to 
my 
mind, 
utterly 
futile 
and 
against 
the 
movement 
of 
history 
in 
the 
present 
age. 


The 
effect 
of 
Bolshevism 
as 
a 
revolutionary 
hope 
is 
greater 
outside 
Russia 
than 
within 
the 
Soviet 
Republic. 
Grim 
realities 
have 
done 
much 
to 
kill 
hope 
among 
those 
who 
are 
subject 
to 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
Moscow. 
Yet 
even 



within 
Russia, 
the 
Communist 
party, 
in 
whose 
hands 
all 
political 
power 
is 
concentrated, 
still 
lives 
by 
hope, 
though 
the 
pressure 
of 
events 
has 
made 
the 
hope 
severe 
and 
stern 
and 
somewhat 
remote. 
It 
is 
this 
hope 
that 
leads 
to 
concentration 
upon 
the 
rising 
generation. 
Russian 
Communists 
often 
avow 
that 
there 
is 
little 
hope 
for 
those 
who 
are 
already 
adult, 
and 
that 
happiness 
can 
only 
come 
to 
the 
children 
who 
have 
grown 
up 
under 
the 
new 
régime 
and 
been 
moulded 
from 
the 
first 
to 
the 
group-mentality 
that 
Communism 
requires. 
It 
is 
only 
after 
the 
lapse 
of 
a 
generation 
that 
they 
hope 
to 
create 
a 
Russia 
that 
shall 
realize 
their 
vision. 


In 
the 
Western 
World, 
the 
hope 
inspired 
by 
Bolshevism 
is 
more 
immediate, 
less 
shot 
through 
with 
tragedy. 
Western 
Socialists 
who 
have 
visited 
Russia 
have 
seen 
fit 
to 
suppress 
the 
harsher 
features 
of 
the 
present 
régime, 
and 
have 
disseminated 
a 
belief 
among 
their 
followers 
that 
the 
millennium 
would 
be 
quickly 
realized 
there 
if 
there 
were 
no 
war 
and 
no 
blockade. 
Even 
those 
Socialists 
who 
are 
not 
Bolsheviks 
for 
their 
own 
country 
have 
mostly 
done 
very 
little 
to 
help 
men 
in 
appraising 
the 
merits 
or 
demerits 
of 
Bolshevik 
methods. 
By 
this 
lack 
of 
courage 
they 
have 
exposed 
Western 
Socialism 
to 
the 
danger 
of 
becoming 
Bolshevik 
through 
ignorance 
of 
the 
price 
that 
has 
to 
be 
paid 
and 
of 
the 
uncertainty 
as 
to 
whether 
the 
desired 
goal 
will 
be 
reached 
in 
the 
end. 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
West 
is 
capable 
of 
adopting 
less 
painful 
and 
more 
certain 
methods 
of 
reaching 
Socialism 
than 
those 
that 
have 
seemed 
necessary 
in 
Russia. 
And 
I 
believe 
that 
while 
some 
forms 
of 
Socialism 
are 
immeasurably 
better 
than 
capitalism, 
others 
are 
even 
worse. 
Among 
those 
that 
are 
worse 
I 
reckon 
the 
form 
which 
is 
being 
achieved 
in 
Russia, 
not 
only 
in 
itself, 
but 
as 
a 
more 
insuperable 
barrier 
to 
further 
progress. 


In 
judging 
of 
Bolshevism 
from 
what 
is 
to 
be 
seen 
in 
Russia 
at 
present, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
disentangle 
various 
factors 
which 
contribute 
to 
a 
single 
result. 
To 
begin 
with, 
Russia 
is 
one 
of 
the 
nations 
that 
were 
defeated 
in 
the 
war; 
this 
has 
produced 
a 
set 
of 
circumstances 
resembling 
those 
found 
in 
Germany 
and 
Austria. 
The 
food 
problem, 
for 
example, 
appears 
to 
be 
essentially 
similar 
in 
all 
three 
countries. 
In 
order 
to 
arrive 
at 
what 
is 
specifically 
Bolshevik, 
we 
must 
first 
eliminate 
what 
is 
merely 
characteristic 
of 
a 
country 
which 
has 
suffered 
military 
disaster. 
Next 
we 
come 
to 
factors 
which 
are 
Russian, 
which 
Russian 
Communists 
share 
with 
other 
Russians, 
but 
not 
with 
other 
Communists. 
There 
is, 
for 
example, 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
disorder 
and 
chaos 
and 
waste, 
which 
shocks 
Westerners 
(especially 
Germans) 
even 
when 
they 
are 
in 



close 
political 
sympathy 
with 
the 
Bolsheviks. 
My 
own 
belief 
is 
that, 
although, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
a 
few 
very 
able 
men, 
the 
Russian 
Government 
is 
less 
efficient 
in 
organization 
than 
the 
Germans 
or 
the 
Americans 
would 
be 
in 
similar 
circumstances, 
yet 
it 
represents 
what 
is 
most 
efficient 
in 
Russia, 
and 
does 
more 
to 
prevent 
chaos 
than 
any 
possible 
alternative 
government 
would 
do. 
Again, 
the 
intolerance 
and 
lack 
of 
liberty 
which 
has 
been 
inherited 
from 
the 
Tsarist 
régime 
is 
probably 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
Russian 
rather 
than 
Communist. 
If 
a 
Communist 
Party 
were 
to 
acquire 
power 
in 
England, 
it 
would 
probably 
be 
met 
by 
a 
less 
irresponsible 
opposition, 
and 
would 
be 
able 
to 
show 
itself 
far 
more 
tolerant 
than 
any 
government 
can 
hope 
to 
be 
in 
Russia 
if 
it 
is 
to 
escape 
assassination. 
This, 
however, 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
degree. 
A 
great 
part 
of 
the 
despotism 
which 
characterizes 
the 
Bolsheviks 
belongs 
to 
the 
essence 
of 
their 
social 
philosophy, 
and 
would 
have 
to 
be 
reproduced, 
even 
if 
in 
a 
milder 
form, 
wherever 
that 
philosophy 
became 
dominant. 


It 
is 
customary 
among 
the 
apologists 
of 
Bolshevism 
in 
the 
West 
to 
excuse 
its 
harshness 
on 
the 
ground 
that 
it 
has 
been 
produced 
by 
the 
necessity 
of 
fighting 
the 
Entente 
and 
its 
mercenaries. 
Undoubtedly 
it 
is 
true 
that 
this 
necessity 
has 
produced 
many 
of 
the 
worst 
elements 
in 
the 
present 
state 
of 
affairs. 
Undoubtedly, 
also, 
the 
Entente 
has 
incurred 
a 
heavy 
load 
of 
guilt 
by 
its 
peevish 
and 
futile 
opposition. 
But 
the 
expectation 
of 
such 
opposition 
was 
always 
part 
of 
Bolshevik 
theory. 
A 
general 
hostility 
to 
the 
first 
Communist 
State 
was 
both 
foreseen 
and 
provoked 
by 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
class 
war. 
Those 
who 
adopt 
the 
Bolshevik 
standpoint 
must 
reckon 
with 
the 
embittered 
hostility 
of 
capitalist 
States; 
it 
is 
not 
worth 
while 
to 
adopt 
Bolshevik 
methods 
unless 
they 
can 
lead 
to 
good 
in 
spite 
of 
this 
hostility. 
To 
say 
that 
capitalists 
are 
wicked 
and 
we 
have 
no 
responsibility 
for 
their 
acts 
is 
unscientific; 
it 
is, 
in 
particular, 
contrary 
to 
the 
Marxian 
doctrine 
of 
economic 
determinism. 
The 
evils 
produced 
in 
Russia 
by 
the 
enmity 
of 
the 
Entente 
are 
therefore 
to 
be 
reckoned 
as 
essential 
in 
the 
Bolshevik 
method 
of 
transition 
to 
Communism, 
not 
as 
specially 
Russian. 
I 
am 
not 
sure 
that 
we 
cannot 
even 
go 
a 
step 
further. 
The 
exhaustion 
and 
misery 
caused 
by 
unsuccessful 
war 
were 
necessary 
to 
the 
success 
of 
the 
Bolsheviks; 
a 
prosperous 
population 
will 
not 
embark 
by 
such 
methods 
upon 
a 
fundamental 
economic 
reconstruction. 
One 
can 
imagine 
England 
becoming 
Bolshevik 
after 
an 
unsuccessful 
war 
involving 
the 
loss 
of 
India--no 
improbable 
contingency 
in 
the 
next 
few 
years. 
But 
at 
present 
the 
average 



wage-earner 
in 
England 
will 
not 
risk 
what 
he 
has 
for 
the 
doubtful 
gain 
of 
a 
revolution. 
A 
condition 
of 
widespread 
misery 
may, 
therefore, 
be 
taken 
as 
indispensable 
to 
the 
inauguration 
of 
Communism, 
unless, 
indeed, 
it 
were 
possible 
to 
establish 
Communism 
more 
or 
less 
peacefully, 
by 
methods 
which 
would 
not, 
even 
temporarily, 
destroy 
the 
economic 
life 
of 
the 
country. 
If 
the 
hopes 
which 
inspired 
Communism 
at 
the 
start, 
and 
which 
still 
inspire 
its 
Western 
advocates, 
are 
ever 
to 
be 
realized, 
the 
problem 
of 
minimizing 
violence 
in 
the 
transition 
must 
be 
faced. 
Unfortunately, 
violence 
is 
in 
itself 
delightful 
to 
most 
really 
vigorous 
revolutionaries, 
and 
they 
feel 
no 
interest 
in 
the 
problem 
of 
avoiding 
it 
as 
far 
as 
possible. 
Hatred 
of 
enemies 
is 
easier 
and 
more 
intense 
than 
love 
of 
friends. 
But 
from 
men 
who 
are 
more 
anxious 
to 
injure 
opponents 
than 
to 
benefit 
the 
world 
at 
large 
no 
great 
good 
is 
to 
be 
expected. 


II 


GENERAL 
CHARACTERISTICS 


I 
entered 
Soviet 
Russia 
on 
May 
11th 
and 
recrossed 
the 
frontier 
on 
June 
16th. 
The 
Russian 
authorities 
only 
admitted 
me 
on 
the 
express 
condition 
that 
I 
should 
travel 
with 
the 
British 
Labour 
Delegation, 
a 
condition 
with 
which 
I 
was 
naturally 
very 
willing 
to 
comply, 
and 
which 
that 
Delegation 
kindly 
allowed 
me 
to 
fulfil. 
We 
were 
conveyed 
from 
the 
frontier 
to 
Petrograd, 
as 
well 
as 
on 
subsequent 
journeys, 
in 
a 
special 
train 
de 
luxe; 
covered 
with 
mottoes 
about 
the 
Social 
Revolution 
and 
the 
Proletariat 
of 
all 
countries; 
we 
were 
received 
everywhere 
by 
regiments 
of 
soldiers, 
with 
the 
Internationale 
being 
played 
on 
the 
regimental 
band 
while 
civilians 
stood 
bare-headed 
and 
soldiers 
at 
the 
salute; 
congratulatory 
orations 
were 
made 
by 
local 
leaders 
and 
answered 
by 
prominent 
Communists 
who 
accompanied 
us; 
the 
entrances 
to 
the 
carriages 
were 
guarded 
by 
magnificent 
Bashkir 
cavalry-men 
in 
resplendent 
uniforms; 
in 
short, 
everything 
was 
done 
to 
make 
us 
feel 
like 
the 
Prince 
of 
Wales. 
Innumerable 
functions 
were 
arranged 
for 
us: 
banquets, 
public 
meetings, 
military 
reviews, 
etc. 


The 
assumption 
was 
that 
we 
had 
come 
to 
testify 
to 
the 
solidarity 
of 
British 
Labour 
with 
Russian 
Communism, 
and 
on 
that 
assumption 
the 
utmost 
possible 
use 
was 
made 
of 
us 
for 
Bolshevik 
propaganda. 
We, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
desired 
to 
ascertain 
what 
we 
could 
of 
Russian 
conditions 
and 
Russian 
methods 
of 
government, 
which 
was 
impossible 
in 
the 
atmosphere 
of 
a 
royal 
progress. 
Hence 
arose 
an 
amicable 
contest, 
degenerating 
at 
times 
into 
a 
game 
of 
hide 
and 
seek: 
while 
they 
assured 
us 
how 
splendid 
the 
banquet 
or 
parade 



was 
going 
to 
be, 
we 
tried 
to 
explain 
how 
much 
we 
should 
prefer 
a 
quiet 
walk 
in 
the 
streets. 
I, 
not 
being 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Delegation, 
felt 
less 
obligation 
than 
my 
companions 
did 
to 
attend 
at 
propaganda 
meetings 
where 
one 
knew 
the 
speeches 
by 
heart 
beforehand. 
In 
this 
way, 
I 
was 
able, 
by 
the 
help 
of 
neutral 
interpreters, 
mostly 
English 
or 
American, 
to 
have 
many 
conversations 
with 
casual 
people 
whom 
I 
met 
in 
the 
streets 
or 
on 
village 
greens, 
and 
to 
find 
out 
how 
the 
whole 
system 
appears 
to 
the 
ordinary 
non-political 
man 
and 
woman. 
The 
first 
five 
days 
we 
spent 
in 
Petrograd, 
the 
next 
eleven 
in 
Moscow. 
During 
this 
time 
we 
were 
living 
in 
daily 
contact 
with 
important 
men 
in 
the 
Government, 
so 
that 
we 
learned 
the 
official 
point 
of 
view 
without 
difficulty. 
I 
saw 
also 
what 
I 
could 
of 
the 
intellectuals 
in 
both 
places. 
We 
were 
all 
allowed 
complete 
freedom 
to 
see 
politicians 
of 
opposition 
parties, 
and 
we 
naturally 
made 
full 
use 
of 
this 
freedom. 
We 
saw 
Mensheviks, 
Social 
Revolutionaries 
of 
different 
groups, 
and 
Anarchists; 
we 
saw 
them 
without 
the 
presence 
of 
any 
Bolsheviks, 
and 
they 
spoke 
freely 
after 
they 
had 
overcome 
their 
initial 
fears. 
I 
had 
an 
hour's 
talk 
with 
Lenin, 
virtually 
tête-à-tête; 
I 
met 
Trotsky, 
though 
only 
in 
company; 
I 
spent 
a 
night 
in 
the 
country 
with 
Kamenev; 
and 
I 
saw 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
other 
men 
who, 
though 
less 
known 
outside 
Russia, 
are 
of 
considerable 
importance 
in 
the 
Government. 


At 
the 
end 
of 
our 
time 
in 
Moscow 
we 
all 
felt 
a 
desire 
to 
see 
something 
of 
the 
country, 
and 
to 
get 
in 
touch 
with 
the 
peasants, 
since 
they 
form 
about 
85 
per 
cent, 
of 
the 
population. 
The 
Government 
showed 
the 
greatest 
kindness 
in 
meeting 
our 
wishes, 
and 
it 
was 
decided 
that 
we 
should 
travel 
down 
the 
Volga 
from 
Nijni 
Novgorod 
to 
Saratov, 
stopping 
at 
many 
places, 
large 
and 
small, 
and 
talking 
freely 
with 
the 
inhabitants. 
I 
found 
this 
part 
of 
the 
time 
extraordinarily 
instructive. 
I 
learned 
to 
know 
more 
than 
I 
should 
have 
thought 
possible 
of 
the 
life 
and 
outlook 
of 
peasants, 
village 
schoolmasters, 
small 
Jew 
traders, 
and 
all 
kinds 
of 
people. 
Unfortunately, 
my 
friend, 
Clifford 
Allen, 
fell 
ill, 
and 
my 
time 
was 
much 
taken 
up 
with 
him. 
This 
had, 
however, 
one 
good 
result, 
namely, 
that 
I 
was 
able 
to 
go 
on 
with 
the 
boat 
to 
Astrakhan, 
as 
he 
was 
too 
ill 
to 
be 
moved 
off 
it. 
This 
not 
only 
gave 
me 
further 
knowledge 
of 
the 
country, 
but 
made 
me 
acquainted 
with 
Sverdlov, 
Acting 
Minister 
of 
Transport, 
who 
was 
travelling 
on 
the 
boat 
to 
organize 
the 
movement 
of 
oil 
from 
Baku 
up 
the 
Volga, 
and 
who 
was 
one 
of 
the 
ablest 
as 
well 
as 
kindest 
people 
whom 
I 
met 
in 
Russia. 


One 
of 
the 
first 
things 
that 
I 
discovered 
after 
passing 
the 
Red 
Flag 
which 
marks 
the 
frontier 
of 
Soviet 
Russia, 
amid 
a 
desolate 
region 
of 
marsh, 
pine 



wood, 
and 
barbed 
wire 
entanglements, 
was 
the 
profound 
difference 
between 
the 
theories 
of 
actual 
Bolsheviks 
and 
the 
version 
of 
those 
theories 
current 
among 
advanced 
Socialists 
in 
this 
country. 
Friends 
of 
Russia 
here 
think 
of 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat 
as 
merely 
a 
new 
form 
of 
representative 
government, 
in 
which 
only 
working 
men 
and 
women 
have 
votes, 
and 
the 
constituencies 
are 
partly 
occupational, 
not 
geographical. 
They 
think 
that 
"proletariat" 
means 
"proletariat," 
but 
"dictatorship" 
does 
not 
quite 
mean 
"dictatorship." 
This 
is 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
truth. 
When 
a 
Russian 
Communist 
speaks 
of 
dictatorship, 
he 
means 
the 
word 
literally, 
but 
when 
he 
speaks 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
he 
means 
the 
word 
in 
a 
Pickwickian 
sense. 
He 
means 
the 
"class-conscious" 
part 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
i.e., 
the 
Communist 
Party.[1] 
He 
includes 
people 
by 
no 
means 
proletarian 
(such 
as 
Lenin 
and 
Tchicherin) 
who 
have 
the 
right 
opinions, 
and 
he 
excludes 
such 
wage-earners 
as 
have 
not 
the 
right 
opinions, 
whom 
he 
classifies 
as 
lackeys 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
The 
Communist 
who 
sincerely 
believes 
the 
party 
creed 
is 
convinced 
that 
private 
property 
is 
the 
root 
of 
all 
evil; 
he 
is 
so 
certain 
of 
this 
that 
he 
shrinks 
from 
no 
measures, 
however 
harsh, 
which 
seem 
necessary 
for 
constructing 
and 
preserving 
the 
Communist 
State. 
He 
spares 
himself 
as 
little 
as 
he 
spares 
others. 
He 
works 
sixteen 
hours 
a 
day, 
and 
foregoes 
his 
Saturday 
half-holiday. 
He 
volunteers 
for 
any 
difficult 
or 
dangerous 
work 
which 
needs 
to 
be 
done, 
such 
as 
clearing 
away 
piles 
of 
infected 
corpses 
left 
by 
Kolchak 
or 
Denikin. 
In 
spite 
of 
his 
position 
of 
power 
and 
his 
control 
of 
supplies, 
he 
lives 
an 
austere 
life. 
He 
is 
not 
pursuing 
personal 
ends, 
but 
aiming 
at 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
new 
social 
order. 
The 
same 
motives, 
however, 
which 
make 
him 
austere 
make 
him 
also 
ruthless. 
Marx 
has 
taught 
that 
Communism 
is 
fatally 
predestined 
to 
come 
about; 
this 
fits 
in 
with 
the 
Oriental 
traits 
in 
the 
Russian 
character, 
and 
produces 
a 
state 
of 
mind 
not 
unlike 
that 
of 
the 
early 
successors 
of 
Mahomet. 
Opposition 
is 
crushed 
without 
mercy, 
and 
without 
shrinking 
from 
the 
methods 
of 
the 
Tsarist 
police, 
many 
of 
whom 
are 
still 
employed 
at 
their 
old 
work. 
Since 
all 
evils 
are 
due 
to 
private 
property, 
the 
evils 
of 
the 
Bolshevik 
régime 
while 
it 
has 
to 
fight 
private 
property 
will 
automatically 
cease 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
has 
succeeded. 


These 
views 
are 
the 
familiar 
consequences 
of 
fanatical 
belief. 
To 
an 
English 
mind 
they 
reinforce 
the 
conviction 
upon 
which 
English 
life 
has 
been 
based 
ever 
since 
1688, 
that 
kindliness 
and 
tolerance 
are 
worth 
all 
the 
creeds 
in 
the 
world--a 
view 
which, 
it 
is 
true, 
we 
do 
not 
apply 
to 
other 
nations 
or 
to 



subject 
races. 


In 
a 
very 
novel 
society 
it 
is 
natural 
to 
seek 
for 
historical 
parallels. 
The 
baser 
side 
of 
the 
present 
Russian 
Government 
is 
most 
nearly 
paralleled 
by 
the 
Directoire 
in 
France, 
but 
on 
its 
better 
side 
it 
is 
closely 
analogous 
to 
the 
rule 
of 
Cromwell. 
The 
sincere 
Communists 
(and 
all 
the 
older 
members 
of 
the 
party 
have 
proved 
their 
sincerity 
by 
years 
of 
persecution) 
are 
not 
unlike 
the 
Puritan 
soldiers 
in 
their 
stern 
politico-moral 
purpose. 
Cromwell's 
dealings 
with 
Parliament 
are 
not 
unlike 
Lenin's 
with 
the 
Constituent 
Assembly. 
Both, 
starting 
from 
a 
combination 
of 
democracy 
and 
religious 
faith, 
were 
driven 
to 
sacrifice 
democracy 
to 
religion 
enforced 
by 
military 
dictatorship. 
Both 
tried 
to 
compel 
their 
countries 
to 
live 
at 
a 
higher 
level 
of 
morality 
and 
effort 
than 
the 
population 
found 
tolerable. 
Life 
in 
modern 
Russia, 
as 
in 
Puritan 
England, 
is 
in 
many 
ways 
contrary 
to 
instinct. 
And 
if 
the 
Bolsheviks 
ultimately 
fall, 
it 
will 
be 
for 
the 
reason 
for 
which 
the 
Puritans 
fell: 
because 
there 
comes 
a 
point 
at 
which 
men 
feel 
that 
amusement 
and 
ease 
are 
worth 
more 
than 
all 
other 
goods 
put 
together. 


Far 
closer 
than 
any 
actual 
historical 
parallel 
is 
the 
parallel 
of 
Plato's 
Republic. 
The 
Communist 
Party 
corresponds 
to 
the 
guardians; 
the 
soldiers 
have 
about 
the 
same 
status 
in 
both; 
there 
is 
in 
Russia 
an 
attempt 
to 
deal 
with 
family 
life 
more 
or 
less 
as 
Plato 
suggested. 
I 
suppose 
it 
may 
be 
assumed 
that 
every 
teacher 
of 
Plato 
throughout 
the 
world 
abhors 
Bolshevism, 
and 
that 
every 
Bolshevik 
regards 
Plato 
as 
an 
antiquated 
bourgeois. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
parallel 
is 
extraordinarily 
exact 
between 
Plato's 
Republic 
and 
the 
régime 
which 
the 
better 
Bolsheviks 
are 
endeavouring 
to 
create. 


Bolshevism 
is 
internally 
aristocratic 
and 
externally 
militant. 
The 
Communists 
in 
many 
ways 
resemble 
the 
British 
public-school 
type: 
they 
have 
all 
the 
good 
and 
bad 
traits 
of 
an 
aristocracy 
which 
is 
young 
and 
vital. 
They 
are 
courageous, 
energetic, 
capable 
of 
command, 
always 
ready 
to 
serve 
the 
State; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
they 
are 
dictatorial, 
lacking 
in 
ordinary 
consideration 
for 
the 
plebs. 
They 
are 
practically 
the 
sole 
possessors 
of 
power, 
and 
they 
enjoy 
innumerable 
advantages 
in 
consequence. 
Most 
of 
them, 
though 
far 
from 
luxurious, 
have 
better 
food 
than 
other 
people. 
Only 
people 
of 
some 
political 
importance 
can 
obtain 
motor-cars 
or 
telephones. 
Permits 
for 
railway 
journeys, 
for 
making 
purchases 
at 
the 
Soviet 
stores 
(where 
prices 
are 
about 
one-fiftieth 
of 
what 
they 
are 
in 
the 
market), 
for 
going 
to 
the 
theatre, 
and 
so 
on, 
are, 
of 
course, 
easier 
to 
obtain 
for 
the 
friends 
of 
those 
in 
power 
than 
for 
ordinary 
mortals. 
In 
a 
thousand 
ways, 
the 
Communists 
have 
a 
life 
which 
is 



happier 
than 
that 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
community. 
Above 
all, 
they 
are 
less 
exposed 
to 
the 
unwelcome 
attentions 
of 
the 
police 
and 
the 
extraordinary 
commission. 


The 
Communist 
theory 
of 
international 
affairs 
is 
exceedingly 
simple. 
The 
revolution 
foretold 
by 
Marx, 
which 
is 
to 
abolish 
capitalism 
throughout 
the 
world, 
happened 
to 
begin 
in 
Russia, 
though 
Marxian 
theory 
would 
seem 
to 
demand 
that 
it 
should 
begin 
in 
America. 
In 
countries 
where 
the 
revolution 
has 
not 
yet 
broken 
out, 
the 
sole 
duty 
of 
a 
Communist 
is 
to 
hasten 
its 
advent. 
Agreements 
with 
capitalist 
States 
can 
only 
be 
make-shifts, 
and 
can 
never 
amount 
on 
either 
side 
to 
a 
sincere 
peace. 
No 
real 
good 
can 
come 
to 
any 
country 
without 
a 
bloody 
revolution: 
English 
Labour 
men 
may 
fancy 
that 
a 
peaceful 
evolution 
is 
possible, 
but 
they 
will 
find 
their 
mistake. 
Lenin 
told 
me 
that 
he 
hopes 
to 
see 
a 
Labour 
Government 
in 
England, 
and 
would 
wish 
his 
supporters 
to 
work 
for 
it, 
but 
solely 
in 
order 
that 
the 
futility 
of 
Parliamentarism 
may 
be 
conclusively 
demonstrated 
to 
the 
British 
working 
man. 
Nothing 
will 
do 
any 
real 
good 
except 
the 
arming 
of 
the 
proletariat 
and 
the 
disarming 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
Those 
who 
preach 
anything 
else 
are 
social 
traitors 
or 
deluded 
fools. 


For 
my 
part, 
after 
weighing 
this 
theory 
carefully, 
and 
after 
admitting 
the 
whole 
of 
its 
indictment 
of 
bourgeois 
capitalism, 
I 
find 
myself 
definitely 
and 
strongly 
opposed 
to 
it. 
The 
Third 
International 
is 
an 
organization 
which 
exists 
to 
promote 
the 
class-war 
and 
to 
hasten 
the 
advent 
of 
revolution 
everywhere. 
My 
objection 
is 
not 
that 
capitalism 
is 
less 
bad 
than 
the 
Bolsheviks 
believe, 
but 
that 
Socialism 
is 
less 
good, 
not 
in 
its 
best 
form, 
but 
in 
the 
only 
form 
which 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
brought 
about 
by 
war. 
The 
evils 
of 
war, 
especially 
of 
civil 
war, 
are 
certain 
and 
very 
great; 
the 
gains 
to 
be 
achieved 
by 
victory 
are 
problematical. 
In 
the 
course 
of 
a 
desperate 
struggle, 
the 
heritage 
of 
civilization 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
lost, 
while 
hatred, 
suspicion, 
and 
cruelty 
become 
normal 
in 
the 
relations 
of 
human 
beings. 
In 
order 
to 
succeed 
in 
war, 
a 
concentration 
of 
power 
is 
necessary, 
and 
from 
concentration 
of 
power 
the 
very 
same 
evils 
flow 
as 
from 
the 
capitalist 
concentration 
of 
wealth. 
For 
these 
reasons 
chiefly, 
I 
cannot 
support 
any 
movement 
which 
aims 
at 
world 
revolution. 
The 
damage 
to 
civilization 
done 
by 
revolution 
in 
one 
country 
may 
be 
repaired 
by 
the 
influence 
of 
another 
in 
which 
there 
has 
been 
no 
revolution; 
but 
in 
a 
universal 
cataclysm 
civilization 
might 
go 
under 
for 
a 
thousand 
years. 
But 
while 
I 
cannot 
advocate 
world 
revolution, 
I 
cannot 
escape 
from 
the 
conclusion 
that 
the 
Governments 
of 
the 
leading 
capitalist 
countries 
are 
doing 



everything 
to 
bring 
it 
about. 
Abuse 
of 
our 
power 
against 
Germany, 
Russia, 
and 
India 
(to 
say 
nothing 
of 
any 
other 
countries) 
may 
well 
bring 
about 
our 
downfall, 
and 
produce 
those 
very 
evils 
which 
the 
enemies 
of 
Bolshevism 
most 
dread. 


The 
true 
Communist 
is 
thoroughly 
international. 
Lenin, 
for 
example, 
so 
far 
as 
I 
could 
judge, 
is 
not 
more 
concerned 
with 
the 
interests 
of 
Russia 
than 
with 
those 
of 
other 
countries; 
Russia 
is, 
at 
the 
moment, 
the 
protagonist 
of 
the 
social 
revolution, 
and, 
as 
such, 
valuable 
to 
the 
world, 
but 
Lenin 
would 
sacrifice 
Russia 
rather 
than 
the 
revolution, 
if 
the 
alternative 
should 
ever 
arise. 
This 
is 
the 
orthodox 
attitude, 
and 
is 
no 
doubt 
genuine 
in 
many 
of 
the 
leaders. 
But 
nationalism 
is 
natural 
and 
instinctive; 
through 
pride 
in 
the 
revolution, 
it 
grows 
again 
even 
in 
the 
breasts 
of 
Communists. 
Through 
the 
Polish 
war, 
the 
Bolsheviks 
have 
acquired 
the 
support 
of 
national 
feeling, 
and 
their 
position 
in 
the 
country 
has 
been 
immensely 
strengthened. 


The 
only 
time 
I 
saw 
Trotsky 
was 
at 
the 
Opera 
in 
Moscow. 
The 
British 
Labour 
Delegation 
were 
occupying 
what 
had 
been 
the 
Tsar's 
box. 
After 
speaking 
with 
us 
in 
the 
ante-chamber, 
he 
stepped 
to 
the 
front 
of 
the 
box 
and 
stood 
with 
folded 
arms 
while 
the 
house 
cheered 
itself 
hoarse. 
Then 
he 
spoke 
a 
few 
sentences, 
short 
and 
sharp, 
with 
military 
precision, 
winding 
up 
by 
calling 
for 
"three 
cheers 
for 
our 
brave 
fellows 
at 
the 
front," 
to 
which 
the 
audience 
responded 
as 
a 
London 
audience 
would 
have 
responded 
in 
the 
autumn 
of 
1914. 
Trotsky 
and 
the 
Red 
Army 
undoubtedly 
now 
have 
behind 
them 
a 
great 
body 
of 
nationalist 
sentiment. 
The 
reconquest 
of 
Asiatic 
Russia 
has 
even 
revived 
what 
is 
essentially 
an 
imperialist 
way 
of 
feeling, 
though 
this 
would 
be 
indignantly 
repudiated 
by 
many 
of 
those 
in 
whom 
I 
seemed 
to 
detect 
it. 
Experience 
of 
power 
is 
inevitably 
altering 
Communist 
theories, 
and 
men 
who 
control 
a 
vast 
governmental 
machine 
can 
hardly 
have 
quite 
the 
same 
outlook 
on 
life 
as 
they 
had 
when 
they 
were 
hunted 
fugitives. 
If 
the 
Bolsheviks 
remain 
in 
power, 
it 
is 
much 
to 
be 
feared 
that 
their 
Communism 
will 
fade, 
and 
that 
they 
will 
increasingly 
resemble 
any 
other 
Asiatic 
Government--for 
example, 
our 
own 
Government 
in 
India.

III 


LENIN, 
TROTSKY 
AND 
GORKY 


Soon 
after 
my 
arrival 
in 
Moscow 
I 
had 
an 
hour's 
conversation 
with 
Lenin 
in 
English, 
which 
he 
speaks 
fairly 
well. 
An 
interpreter 
was 
present, 
but 
his 
services 
were 
scarcely 
required. 
Lenin's 
room 
is 
very 
bare; 
it 
contains 
a 
big 
desk, 
some 
maps 
on 
the 
walls, 
two 
book-cases, 
and 
one 
comfortable 
chair 
for 
visitors 
in 
addition 
to 
two 
or 
three 
hard 
chairs. 
It 
is 
obvious 
that 
he 
has 
no 
love 
of 
luxury 
or 
even 
comfort. 
He 
is 
very 
friendly, 
and 
apparently 
simple, 
entirely 
without 
a 
trace 
of 
hauteur. 
If 
one 
met 
him 
without 
knowing 
who 
he 
was, 
one 
would 
not 
guess 
that 
he 
is 
possessed 
of 
great 
power 
or 
even 
that 
he 
is 
in 
any 
way 
eminent. 
I 
have 
never 
met 
a 
personage 
so 
destitute 
of 
self-
importance. 
He 
looks 
at 
his 
visitors 
very 
closely, 
and 
screws 
up 
one 
eye, 
which 
seems 
to 
increase 
alarmingly 
the 
penetrating 
power 
of 
the 
other. 
He 
laughs 
a 
great 
deal; 
at 
first 
his 
laugh 
seems 
merely 
friendly 
and 
jolly, 
but 
gradually 
I 
came 
to 
feel 
it 
rather 
grim. 
He 
is 
dictatorial, 
calm, 
incapable 
of 
fear, 
extraordinarily 
devoid 
of 
self-seeking, 
an 
embodied 
theory. 
The 
materialist 
conception 
of 
history, 
one 
feels, 
is 
his 
life-blood. 
He 
resembles 
a 
professor 
in 
his 
desire 
to 
have 
the 
theory 
understood 
and 
in 
his 
fury 
with 
those 
who 
misunderstand 
or 
disagree, 
as 
also 
in 
his 
love 
of 
expounding, 
I 
got 
the 
impression 
that 
he 
despises 
a 
great 
many 
people 
and 
is 
an 
intellectual 
aristocrat. 


The 
first 
question 
I 
asked 
him 
was 
as 
to 
how 
far 
he 
recognized 
the 
peculiarity 
of 
English 
economic 
and 
political 
conditions? 
I 
was 
anxious 
to 
know 
whether 
advocacy 
of 
violent 
revolution 
is 
an 
indispensable 
condition 
of 
joining 
the 
Third 
International, 
although 
I 
did 
not 
put 
this 
question 
directly 
because 
others 
were 
asking 
it 
officially. 
His 
answer 
was 
unsatisfactory 
to 
me. 
He 
admitted 
that 
there 
is 
little 
chance 
of 
revolution 
in 
England 
now, 
and 
that 
the 
working 
man 
is 
not 
yet 
disgusted 
with 
Parliamentary 
government. 
But 
he 
hopes 
that 
this 
result 
may 
be 
brought 
about 
by 
a 
Labour 
Ministry. 
He 
thinks 
that, 
if 
Mr. 
Henderson, 
for 
instance, 
were 
to 
become 
Prime 
Minister, 
nothing 
of 
importance 
would 
be 
done; 
organized 
Labour 
would 
then, 
so 
he 
hopes 
and 
believes, 
turn 
to 
revolution. 
On 
this 
ground, 
he 
wishes 
his 
supporters 
in 
this 
country 
to 
do 
everything 
in 
their 
power 
to 
secure 
a 
Labour 
majority 
in 
Parliament; 
he 
does 
not 
advocate 
abstention 
from 
Parliamentary 
contests, 
but 
participation 
with 
a 
view 
to 
making 
Parliament 
obviously 
contemptible. 
The 
reasons 
which 
make 
attempts 
at 
violent 
revolution 
seem 
to 
most 
of 
us 
both 
improbable 
and 
undesirable 
in 
this 
country 
carry 
no 
weight 
with 
him, 
and 



seem 
to 
him 
mere 
bourgeois 
prejudices. 
When 
I 
suggested 
that 
whatever 
is 
possible 
in 
England 
can 
be 
achieved 
without 
bloodshed, 
he 
waved 
aside 
the 
suggestion 
as 
fantastic. 
I 
got 
little 
impression 
of 
knowledge 
or 
psychological 


imagination 
as 
regards 
Great 
Britain. 
Indeed 
the 
whole 
tendency 
of 
Marxianism 
is 
against 
psychological 
imagination, 
since 
it 
attributes 
everything 
in 
politics 
to 
purely 
material 
causes. 


I 
asked 
him 
next 
whether 
he 
thought 
it 
possible 
to 
establish 
Communism 
firmly 
and 
fully 
in 
a 
country 
containing 
such 
a 
large 
majority 
of 
peasants. 
He 
admitted 
that 
it 
was 
difficult, 
and 
laughed 
over 
the 
exchange 
the 
peasant 
is 
compelled 
to 
make, 
of 
food 
for 
paper; 
the 
worthlessness 
of 
Russian 
paper 
struck 
him 
as 
comic. 
But 
he 
said--what 
is 
no 
doubt 
true--that 
things 
will 
right 
themselves 
when 
there 
are 
goods 
to 
offer 
to 
the 
peasant. 
For 
this 
he 
looks 
partly 
to 
electrification 
in 
industry, 
which, 
he 
says, 
is 
a 
technical 
necessity 
in 
Russia, 
but 
will 
take 
ten 
years 
to 
complete.[2] 
He 
spoke 
with 
enthusiasm, 
as 
they 
all 
do, 
of 
the 
great 
scheme 
for 
generating 
electrical 
power 
by 
means 
of 
peat. 
Of 
course 
he 
looks 
to 
the 
raising 
of 
the 
blockade 
as 
the 
only 
radical 
cure; 
but 
he 
was 
not 
very 
hopeful 
of 
this 
being 
achieved 
thoroughly 
or 
permanently 
except 
through 
revolutions 
in 
other 
countries. 
Peace 
between 
Bolshevik 
Russia 
and 
capitalist 
countries, 
he 
said, 
must 
always 
be 
insecure; 
the 
Entente 
might 
be 
led 
by 
weariness 
and 
mutual 
dissensions 
to 
conclude 
peace, 
but 
he 
felt 
convinced 
that 
the 
peace 
would 
be 
of 
brief 
duration. 
I 
found 
in 
him, 
as 
in 
almost 
all 
leading 
Communists, 
much 
less 
eagerness 
than 
existed 
in 
our 
delegation 
for 
peace 
and 
the 
raising 
of 
the 
blockade. 
He 
believes 
that 
nothing 
of 
real 
value 
can 
be 
achieved 
except 
through 
world 
revolution 
and 
the 
abolition 
of 
capitalism; 
I 
felt 
that 
he 
regarded 
the 
resumption 
of 
trade 
with 
capitalist 
countries 
as 
a 
mere 
palliative 
of 
doubtful 
value. 


He 
described 
the 
division 
between 
rich 
and 
poor 
peasants, 
and 
the 
Government 
propaganda 
among 
the 
latter 
against 
the 
former, 
leading 
to 
acts 
of 
violence 
which 
he 
seemed 
to 
find 
amusing. 
He 
spoke 
as 
though 
the 
dictatorship 
over 
the 
peasant 
would 
have 
to 
continue 
a 
long 
time, 
because 
of 
the 
peasant's 
desire 
for 
free 
trade. 
He 
said 
he 
knew 
from 
statistics 
(what 
I 
can 
well 
believe) 
that 
the 
peasants 
have 
had 
more 
to 
eat 
these 
last 
two 
years 
than 
they 
ever 
had 
before, 
"and 
yet 
they 
are 
against 
us," 
he 
added 
a 
little 
wistfully. 
I 
asked 
him 
what 
to 
reply 
to 
critics 
who 
say 
that 
in 
the 
country 
he 
has 
merely 
created 
peasant 
proprietorship, 
not 
Communism; 
he 
replied 
that 
that 
is 
not 
quite 
the 
truth, 
but 
he 
did 
not 
say 
what 
the 
truth 
is.[3] 



The 
last 
question 
I 
asked 
him 
was 
whether 
resumption 
of 
trade 
with 
capitalist 
countries, 
if 
it 
took 
place, 
would 
not 
create 
centres 
of 
capitalist 
influence, 
and 
make 
the 
preservation 
of 
Communism 
more 
difficult? 
It 
had 
seemed 
to 
me 
that 
the 
more 
ardent 
Communists 
might 
well 
dread 
commercial 
intercourse 
with 
the 
outer 
world, 
as 
leading 
to 
an 
infiltration 
of 
heresy, 
and 
making 
the 
rigidity 
of 
the 
present 
system 
almost 
impossible. 
I 
wished 
to 
know 
whether 
he 
had 
such 
a 
feeling. 
He 
admitted 
that 
trade 
would 
create 
difficulties, 
but 
said 
they 
would 
be 
less 
than 
those 
of 
the 
war. 
He 
said 
that 
two 
years 
ago 
neither 
he 
nor 
his 
colleagues 
thought 
they 
could 
survive 
against 
the 
hostility 
of 
the 
world. 
He 
attributes 
their 
survival 
to 
the 
jealousies 
and 
divergent 
interests 
of 
the 
different 
capitalist 
nations; 
also 
to 
the 
power 
of 
Bolshevik 
propaganda. 
He 
said 
the 
Germans 
had 
laughed 
when 
the 
Bolsheviks 
proposed 
to 
combat 
guns 
with 
leaflets, 
but 
that 
the 
event 
had 
proved 
the 
leaflets 
quite 
as 
powerful. 
I 
do 
not 
think 
he 
recognizes 
that 
the 
Labour 
and 
Socialist 
parties 
have 
had 
any 
part 
in 
the 
matter. 
He 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
know 
that 
the 
attitude 
of 
British 
Labour 
has 
done 
a 
great 
deal 
to 
make 
a 
first-class 
war 
against 
Russia 
impossible, 
since 
it 
has 
confined 
the 
Government 
to 
what 
could 
be 
done 
in 
a 
hole-and-corner 
way, 
and 
denied 
without 
a 
too 
blatant 
mendacity. 


He 
thoroughly 
enjoys 
the 
attacks 
of 
Lord 
Northcliffe, 
to 
whom 
he 
wishes 
to 
send 
a 
medal 
for 
Bolshevik 
propaganda. 
Accusations 
of 
spoliation, 
he 
remarked, 
may 
shock 
the 
bourgeois, 
but 
have 
an 
opposite 
effect 
upon 
the 
proletarian. 


I 
think 
if 
I 
had 
met 
him 
without 
knowing 
who 
he 
was, 
I 
should 
not 
have 
guessed 
that 
he 
was 
a 
great 
man; 
he 
struck 
me 
as 
too 
opinionated 
and 
narrowly 
orthodox. 
His 
strength 
comes, 
I 
imagine, 
from 
his 
honesty, 
courage, 
and 
unwavering 
faith--religious 
faith 
in 
the 
Marxian 
gospel, 
which 
takes 
the 
place 
of 
the 
Christian 
martyr's 
hopes 
of 
Paradise, 
except 
that 
it 
is 
less 
egotistical. 
He 
has 
as 
little 
love 
of 
liberty 
as 
the 
Christians 
who 
suffered 
under 
Diocletian, 
and 
retaliated 
when 
they 
acquired 
power. 
Perhaps 
love 
of 
liberty 
is 
incompatible 
with 
whole-hearted 
belief 
in 
a 
panacea 
for 
all 
human 
ills. 
If 
so, 
I 
cannot 
but 
rejoice 
in 
the 
sceptical 
temper 
of 
the 
Western 
world. 
I 
went 
to 
Russia 
a 
Communist; 
but 
contact 
with 
those 
who 
have 
no 
doubts 
has 
intensified 
a 
thousandfold 
my 
own 
doubts, 
not 
as 
to 
Communism 
in 
itself, 
but 
as 
to 
the 
wisdom 
of 
holding 
a 
creed 
so 
firmly 
that 
for 
its 
sake 
men 
are 
willing 
to 
inflict 
widespread 
misery. 


Trotsky, 
whom 
the 
Communists 
do 
not 
by 
any 
means 
regard 
as 
Lenin's 



equal, 
made 
more 
impression 
upon 
me 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
intelligence 
and 
personality, 
though 
not 
of 
character. 
I 
saw 
too 
little 
of 
him, 
however, 
to 
have 
more 
than 
a 
very 
superficial 
impression. 
He 
has 
bright 
eyes, 
military 
bearing, 
lightning 
intelligence 
and 
magnetic 
personality. 
He 
is 
very 
good-
looking, 
with 
admirable 
wavy 
hair; 
one 
feels 
he 
would 
be 
irresistible 
to 
women. 
I 
felt 
in 
him 
a 
vein 
of 
gay 
good 
humour, 
so 
long 
as 
he 
was 
not 
crossed 
in 
any 
way. 
I 
thought, 
perhaps 
wrongly, 
that 
his 
vanity 
was 
even 
greater 
than 
his 
love 
of 
power--the 
sort 
of 
vanity 
that 
one 
associates 
with 
an 
artist 
or 
actor. 
The 
comparison 
with 
Napoleon 
was 
forced 
upon 
one. 
But 
I 
had 
no 
means 
of 
estimating 
the 
strength 
of 
his 
Communist 
conviction, 
which 
may 
be 
very 
sincere 
and 
profound. 


An 
extraordinary 
contrast 
to 
both 
these 
men 
was 
Gorky, 
with 
whom 
I 
had 
a 
brief 
interview 
in 
Petrograd. 
He 
was 
in 
bed, 
apparently 
very 
ill 
and 
obviously 
heart-broken. 
He 
begged 
me, 
in 
anything 
I 
might 
say 
about 
Russia, 
always 
to 
emphasize 
what 
Russia 
has 
suffered. 
He 
supports 
the 
Government-as 
I 
should 
do, 
if 
I 
were 
a 
Russian--not 
because 
he 
thinks 
it 
faultless, 
but 
because 
the 
possible 
alternatives 
are 
worse. 
One 
felt 
in 
him 
a 
love 
of 
the 
Russian 
people 
which 
makes 
their 
present 
martyrdom 
almost 
unbearable, 
and 
prevents 
the 
fanatical 
faith 
by 
which 
the 
pure 
Marxians 
are 
upheld. 
I 
felt 
him 
the 
most 
lovable, 
and 
to 
me 
the 
most 
sympathetic, 
of 
all 
the 
Russians 
I 
saw. 
I 
wished 
for 
more 
knowledge 
of 
his 
outlook, 
but 
he 
spoke 
with 
difficulty 
and 
was 
constantly 
interrupted 
by 
terrible 
fits 
of 
coughing, 
so 
that 
I 
could 
not 
stay. 
All 
the 
intellectuals 
whom 
I 
met--a 
class 
who 
have 
suffered 
terribly-expressed 
their 
gratitude 
to 
him 
for 
what 
he 
has 
done 
on 
their 
behalf. 
The 
materialistic 
conception 
of 
history 
is 
all 
very 
well, 
but 
some 
care 
for 
the 
higher 
things 
of 
civilization 
is 
a 
relief. 
The 
Bolsheviks 
are 
sometimes 
said 
to 
have 
done 
great 
things 
for 
art, 
but 
I 
could 
not 
discover 
that 
they 
had 
done 
more 
than 
preserve 
something 
of 
what 
existed 
before. 
When 
I 
questioned 
one 
of 
them 
on 
the 
subject, 
he 
grew 
impatient, 
and 
said: 
"We 
haven't 
time 
for 
a 
new 
art, 
any 
more 
than 
for 
a 
new 
religion." 
Unavoidably, 
although 
the 
Government 
favours 
art 
as 
much 
as 
it 
can, 
the 
atmosphere 
is 
one 
in 
which 
art 
cannot 
flourish, 
because 
art 
is 
anarchic 
and 
resistant 
to 
organization. 
Gorky 
has 
done 
all 
that 
one 
man 
could 
to 
preserve 
the 
intellectual 
and 
artistic 
life 
of 
Russia. 
I 
feared 
that 
he 
was 
dying, 
and 
that, 
perhaps, 
it 
was 
dying 
too. 
But 
he 
recovered, 
and 
I 
hope 
it 
will 
recover 
also.

IV 


ART 
AND 
EDUCATION 


It 
has 
often 
been 
said 
that, 
whatever 
the 
inadequacy 
of 
Bolshevik 
organization 
in 
other 
fields, 
in 
art 
and 
in 
education 
at 
least 
they 
have 
made 
great 
progress. 


To 
take 
first 
of 
all 
art: 
it 
is 
true 
that 
they 
began 
by 
recognizing, 
as 
perhaps 
no 
other 
revolutionary 
government 
would, 
the 
importance 
and 
spontaneity 
of 
the 
artistic 
impulse, 
and 
therefore 
while 
they 
controlled 
or 
destroyed 
the 
counter-revolutionary 
in 
all 
other 
social 
activities, 
they 
allowed 
the 
artist, 
whatever 
his 
political 
creed, 
complete 
freedom 
to 
continue 
his 
work. 
Moreover, 
as 
regards 
clothing 
and 
rations 
they 
treated 
him 
especially 
well. 
This, 
and 
the 
care 
devoted 
to 
the 
upkeep 
of 
churches, 
public 
monuments, 
and 
museums, 
are 
well-known 
facts, 
to 
which 
there 
has 
already 
been 
ample 
testimony. 


The 
preservation 
of 
the 
old 
artistic 
community 
practically 
intact 
was 
the 
more 
remarkable 
in 
view 
of 
the 
pronounced 
sympathy 
of 
most 
of 
them 
with 
the 
old 
régime. 
The 
theory, 
however, 
was 
that 
art 
and 
politics 
belonged 
to 
two 
separate 
realms; 
but 
great 
honour 
would 
of 
course 
be 
the 
portion 
of 
those 
artists 
who 
would 
be 
inspired 
by 
the 
revolution. 


Three 
years' 
experience, 
however, 
have 
proved 
the 
falsity 
of 
this 
doctrine 
and 
led 
to 
a 
divorce 
between 
art 
and 
popular 
feeling 
which 
a 
sensitive 
observer 
cannot 
fail 
to 
remark. 
It 
is 
glaringly 
apparent 
in 
the 
hitherto 
most 
vital 
of 
all 
Russian 
arts, 
the 
theatre. 
The 
artists 
have 
continued 
to 
perform 
the 



old 
classics 
in 
tragedy 
or 
comedy, 
and 
the 
old-style 
operette. 
The 
theatre 
programmes 
have 
remained 
the 
same 
for 
the 
last 
two 
years, 
and, 
but 
for 
the 
higher 
standard 
of 
artistic 
performance, 
might 
belong 
to 
the 
theatres 
of 
Paris 
or 
London. 
As 
one 
sits 
in 
the 
theatre, 
one 
is 
so 
acutely 
conscious 
of 
the 
discrepancy 
between 
the 
daily 
life 
of 
the 
audience 
and 
that 
depicted 
in 
the 
play 
that 
the 
latter 
seems 
utterly 
dead 
and 
meaningless. 
To 
some 
of 
the 
more 
fiery 
Communists 
it 
appears 
that 
a 
mistake 
has 
been 
made. 
They 
complain 
that 
bourgeois 
art 
is 
being 
preserved 
long 
after 
its 
time, 
they 
accuse 
the 
artists 
of 
showing 
contempt 
for 
their 
public, 
of 
being 
as 
untouched 
by 
the 
revolutionary 
mood 
as 
an 
elderly 
bourgeoise 
bewailing 
the 
loss 
of 
her 
personal 
comfort; 
they 
would 
like 
to 
see 
only 
the 
revolutionary 
mood 
embodied 
in 
art, 
and 
to 
achieve 
this 
would 
make 
a 
clean 
sweep, 
enforcing 
the 
writing 
and 
performance 
of 
nothing 
but 
revolutionary 
plays 
and 
the 
painting 
of 
revolutionary 
pictures. 
Nor 
can 
it 
be 
argued 
that 
they 
are 
wrong 
as 
to 
the 
facts: 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
the 
preservation 
of 
the 
old 
artistic 
tradition 
has 
served 
very 
little 
purpose; 
but 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
it 
is 
equally 
plain 
that 
an 
artist 
cannot 
be 
drilled 
like 
a 
military 
recruit. 
There 
is, 
fortunately, 
no 
sign 
that 
these 
tactics 
will 
be 
directly 
adopted, 
but 
in 
an 
indirect 
fashion 
they 
are 
already 
being 
applied. 
An 
artist 
is 
not 
to 
blame 
if 
his 
temperament 
leads 
him 
to 
draw 
cartoons 
of 
leading 
Bolsheviks, 
or 
satirize 
the 
various 
comical 
aspects--and 
they 
are 
many--of 
the 
Soviet 
régime. 
To 
force 
such 
a 
man, 
however, 
to 
turn 
his 
talent 
only 
against 
Denikin, 
Yudenitch 
and 
Kolchak, 
or 
the 
leaders 
of 
the 
Entente, 
is 
momentarily 
good 
for 
Communism, 
but 
it 
is 
discouraging 
to 
the 
artist, 
and 
may 
prove 
in 
the 
long 
run 
bad 
for 
art, 
and 
possibly 
for 
Communism 
also. 
It 
is 
plain 
from 
the 
religious 
nature 
of 
Communism 
in 
Russia, 
that 
such 
controlling 
of 
the 
impulse 
to 
artistic 
creation 
is 
inevitable, 
and 
that 
propaganda 
art 
alone 
can 
flourish 
in 
such 
an 
atmosphere. 
For 
example, 
no 
poetry 
or 
literature 
that 
is 
not 
orthodox 
will 
reach 
the 
printing 
press. 
It 
is 
so 
easy 
to 
make 
the 
excuse 
of 
lack 
of 
paper 
and 
the 
urgent 
need 
for 
manifestoes. 
Thus 
there 
may 
well 
come 
to 
be 
a 
repetition 
of 
the 
attitude 
of 
the 
mediæval 
Church 
to 
the 
sagas 
and 
legends 
of 
the 
people, 
except 
that, 
in 
this 
case, 
it 
is 
the 
folk 
tales 
which 
will 
be 
preserved, 
and 
the 
more 
sensitive 
and 
civilized 
products 
banned. 
The 
only 
poet 
who 
seems 
to 
be 
much 
spoken 
of 
at 
present 
in 
Russia 
is 
one 
who 
writes 
rough 
popular 
songs. 
There 
are 
revolutionary 
odes, 
but 
one 
may 
hazard 
a 
guess 
that 
they 
resemble 
our 
patriotic 
war 
poetry. 


I 
said 
that 
this 
state 
of 
affairs 
may 
in 
the 
long 
run 
be 
bad 
for 
art, 
but 
the 



contrary 
may 
equally 
well 
prove 
to 
be 
the 
truth. 
It 
is 
of 
course 
discouraging 
and 
paralysing 
to 
the 
old-style 
artist, 
and 
it 
is 
death 
to 
the 
old 
individual 
art 
which 
depended 
on 
subtlety 
and 
oddity 
of 
temperament, 
and 
arose 
very 
largely 
from 
the 
complicated 
psychology 
of 
the 
idle. 
There 
it 
stands, 
this 
old 
art, 
the 
purest 
monument 
to 
the 
nullity 
of 
the 
art-for-art's-sake 
doctrine, 
like 
a 
rich 
exotic 
plant 
of 
exquisite 
beauty, 
still 
apparently 
in 
its 
glory, 
till 
one 
perceives 
that 
the 
roots 
are 
cut, 
and 
that 
leaf 
by 
leaf 
it 
is 
gradually 
fading 
away. 


But, 
unlike 
the 
Puritans 
in 
this 
respect, 
the 
Bolsheviks 
have 
not 
sought 
to 
dig 
up 
the 
roots, 
and 
there 
are 
signs 
that 
the 
paralysis 
is 
merely 
temporary. 
Moreover, 
individual 
art 
is 
not 
the 
only 
form, 
and 
in 
particular 
the 
plastic 
arts 
have 
shown 
that 
they 
can 
live 
by 
mass 
action, 
and 
flourish 
under 
an 
intolerant 
faith. 
Communist 
artists 
of 
the 
future 
may 
erect 
public 
buildings 
surpassing 
in 
beauty 
the 
mediæval 
churches, 
they 
may 
paint 
frescoes, 
organize 
pageants, 
make 
Homeric 
songs 
about 
their 
heroes. 
Communist 
art 
will 
begin, 
and 
is 
beginning 
now, 
in 
the 
propaganda 
pictures, 
and 
stories 
such 
as 
those 
designed 
for 
peasants 
and 
children. 
There 
is, 
for 
instance, 
a 
kind 
of 
Rake's 
Progress 
or 
"How 
she 
became 
a 
Communist," 
in 
which 
the 
Entente 
leaders 
make 
a 
sorry 
and 
grotesque 
appearance. 
Lenin 
and 
Trotsky 
already 
figure 
in 
woodcuts 
as 
Moses 
and 
Aaron, 
deliverers 
of 
their 
people, 
while 
the 
mother 
and 
child 
who 
illustrate 
the 
statistics 
of 
the 
maternity 
exhibition 
have 
the 
grace 
and 
beauty 
of 
mediæval 
madonnas. 
Russia 
is 
only 
now 
emerging 
from 
the 
middle 
ages, 
and 
the 
Church 
tradition 
in 
painting 
is 
passing 
with 
incredible 
smoothness 
into 
the 
service 
of 
Communist 
doctrine. 
These 
pictures 
have, 
too, 
an 
oriental 
flavour: 
there 
are 
brown 
Madonnas 
in 
the 
Russian 
churches, 
and 
such 
an 
one 
illustrates 
the 
statistics 
of 
infant 
mortality 
in 
India, 
while 
the 
Russian 
mother, 
broad-footed, 
in 
gay 
petticoat 
and 
kerchief, 
sits 
in 
a 
starry 
meadow 
suckling 
her 
baby 
from 
a 
very 
ample 
white 
breast. 
I 
think 
that 
this 
movement 
towards 
the 
Church 
tradition 
may 
be 
unconscious 
and 
instinctive, 
and 
would 
perhaps 
be 
deplored 
by 
many 
Communists, 
for 
whom 
grandiose 
bad 
Rodin 
statuary 
and 
the 
crudity 
of 
cubism 
better 
express 
what 
they 
mean 
by 
revolution. 
But 
this 
revolution 
is 
Russian 
and 
not 
French, 
and 
its 
art, 
if 
all 
goes 
well, 
should 
inevitably 
bear 
the 
popular 
Russian 
stamp. 
It 
is 
would-be 
primitive 
and 
popular 
art 
that 
is 
vulgar. 
Such 
at 
least 
is 
the 
reflection 
engendered 
by 
an 
inspection 
of 
Russian 
peasant 
work 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
spirit 
of 
Children's 
Tales. 


The 
Russian 
peasant's 
artistic 
impulse 
is 
no 
legend. 
Besides 
the 
carving 



and 
embroidery 
which 
speak 
eloquently 
to 
peasant 
skill, 
one 
observes 
many 
instances 
in 
daily 
life. 
He 
will 
climb 
down, 
when 
his 
slowly-moving 
train 
stops 
by 
the 
wayside, 
to 
gather 
branches 
and 
flowers 
with 
which 
he 
will 
decorate 
the 
railway 
carriage 
both 
inside 
and 
out, 
he 
will 
work 
willingly 
at 
any 
task 
which 
has 
beauty 
for 
its 
object, 
and 
was 
all 
too 
prone 
under 
the 
old 
régime 
to 
waste 
his 
time 
and 
his 
employer's 
material 
in 
fashioning 
small 
metal 
or 
wooden 
objects 
with 
his 
hands. 


If 
the 
bourgeois 
tradition 
then 
will 
not 
serve, 
there 
is 
a 
popular 
tradition 
which 
is 
still 
live 
and 
passionate 
and 
which 
may 
perhaps 
persist. 
Unhappily 
it 
has 
a 
formidable 
enemy 
in 
the 
organization 
and 
development 
of 
industry, 
which 
is 
far 
more 
dangerous 
to 
art 
than 
Communist 
doctrine. 
Indeed, 
industry 
in 
its 
early 
stages 
seems 
everywhere 
doomed 
to 
be 
the 
enemy 
of 
beauty 
and 
instinctive 
life. 
One 
might 
hope 
that 
this 
would 
not 
prove 
to 
be 
so 
in 
Russia, 
the 
first 
Socialist 
State, 
as 
yet 
unindustrial, 
able 
to 
draw 
on 
the 
industrial 
experience 
of 
the 
whole 
world, 
were 
it 
not 
that 
one 
discovers 
with 
a 
certain 
misgiving 
in 
the 
Bolshevik 
leaders 
the 
rasping 
arid 
temperament 
of 
those 
to 
whom 
the 
industrial 
machine 
is 
an 
end 
in 
itself, 
and, 
in 
addition, 
reflects 
that 
these 
industrially 
minded 
men 
have 
as 
yet 
no 
practical 
experience, 
nor 
do 
there 
exist 
men 
of 
goodwill 
to 
help 
them. 
It 
does 
not 
seem 
reasonable 
to 
hope 
that 
Russia 
can 
pass 
through 
the 
period 
of 
industrialization 
without 
a 
good 
deal 
of 
mismanagement, 
involving 
waste 
resulting 
in 
too 
long 
hours, 
child 
labour 
and 
other 
evils 
with 
which 
the 
West 
is 
all 
too 
familiar. 
What 
the 
Bolsheviks 
would 
not 
therefore 
willingly 
do 
to 
art, 
the 
Juggernaut 
which 
they 
are 
bent 
on 
setting 
in 
motion 
may 
accomplish 
for 
them. 


The 
next 
generation 
in 
Russia 
will 
have 
to 
consist 
of 
practical 
hardworking 
men, 
the 
old-style 
artists 
will 
die 
off 
and 
successors 
will 
not 
readily 
arise. 
A 
State 
which 
is 
struggling 
with 
economic 
difficulties 
is 
bound 
to 
be 
slow 
to 
admit 
an 
artistic 
vocation, 
since 
this 
involves 
exemption 
from 
practical 
work. 
Moreover 
the 
majority 
of 
minds 
always 
turn 
instinctively 
to 
the 
real 
need 
of 
the 
moment. 
A 
man 
therefore 
who 
is 
adapted 
by 
talent 
and 
temperament 
to 
becoming 
an 
opera 
singer, 
will 
under 
the 
pressure 
of 
Communist 
enthusiasm 
and 
Government 
encouragement 
turn 
his 
attention 
to 
economics. 
(I 
am 
here 
quoting 
an 
actual 
instance.) 
The 
whole 
Russian 
people 
at 
this 
stage 
in 
their 
development 
strike 
one 
as 
being 
forced 
by 
the 
logic 
of 
their 
situation 
to 
make 
a 
similar 
choice. 


It 
may 
be 
all 
to 
the 
good 
that 
there 
should 
be 
fewer 
professional 
artists, 
since 
some 
of 
the 
finest 
work 
has 
been 
done 
by 
men 
and 
groups 
of 
men 
to 



whom 
artistic 
expression 
was 
only 
a 
pastime. 
They 
were 
not 
hampered 
by 
the 
solemnity 
and 
reverence 
for 
art 
which 
too 
often 
destroy 
the 
spontaneity 
of 
the 
professional. 
Indeed 
a 
revival 
of 
this 
attitude 
to 
art 
is 
one 
of 
the 
good 
results 
which 
may 
be 
hoped 
for 
from 
a 
Communist 
revolution 
in 
a 
more 
advanced 
industrial 
community. 
There 
the 
problem 
of 
education 
will 
be 
to 
stimulate 
the 
creative 
impulses 
towards 
art 
and 
science 
so 
that 
men 
may 
know 
how 
to 
employ 
their 
leisure 
hours. 
Work 
in 
the 
factory 
can 
never 
be 
made 
to 
provide 
an 
adequate 
outlet. 
The 
only 
hope, 
if 
men 
are 
to 
remain 
human 
beings 
under 
industrialism, 
is 
to 
reduce 
hours 
to 
the 
minimum. 
But 
this 
is 
only 
possible 
when 
production 
and 
organization 
are 
highly 
efficient, 
which 
will 
not 
be 
the 
case 
for 
a 
long 
time 
in 
Russia. 
Hence 
not 
only 
does 
it 
appear 
that 
the 
number 
of 
artists 
will 
grow 
less, 
but 
that 
the 
number 
of 
people 
undamaged 
in 
their 
artistic 
impulses 
and 
on 
that 
account 
able 
to 
create 
or 
appreciate 
as 
amateurs 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
deplorably 
small. 
It 
is 
in 
this 
damaging 
effect 
of 
industry 
on 
human 
instinct 
that 
the 
immediate 
danger 
to 
art 
in 
Russia 
lies. 


The 
effect 
of 
industry 
on 
the 
crafts 
is 
quite 
obvious. 
A 
craftsman 
who 
is 
accustomed 
to 
work 
with 
his 
hands, 
following 
the 
tradition 
developed 
by 
his 
ancestors, 
is 
useless 
when 
brought 
face 
to 
face 
with 
a 
machine. 
And 
the 
man 
who 
can 
handle 
the 
machine 
will 
only 
be 
concerned 
with 
quantity 
and 
utility 
in 
the 
first 
instance. 
Only 
gradually 
do 
the 
claims 
of 
beauty 
come 
to 
be 
recognized. 
Compare 
the 
modern 
motor 
car 
with 
the 
first 
of 
its 
species, 
or 
even, 
since 
the 
same 
law 
seems 
to 
operate 
in 
nature, 
the 
prehistoric 
animal 
with 
its 
modern 
descendant. 
The 
same 
relation 
exists 
between 
them 
as 
between 
man 
and 
the 
ape, 
or 
the 
horse 
and 
the 
hipparion. 
The 
movement 
of 
life 
seems 
to 
be 
towards 
ever 
greater 
delicacy 
and 
complexity, 
and 
man 
carries 
it 
forward 
in 
the 
articles 
that 
he 
makes 
and 
the 
society 
that 
he 
develops. 
Industry 
is 
a 
new 
tool, 
difficult 
to 
handle, 
but 
it 
will 
produce 
just 
as 
beautiful 
objects 
as 
did 
the 
mediæval 
builder 
and 
craftsman, 
though 
not 
until 
it 
has 
been 
in 
being 
for 
a 
long 
time 
and 
belongs 
to 
tradition. 


One 
may 
expect, 
therefore, 
that 
while 
the 
crafts 
in 
Russia 
will 
lose 
in 
artistic 
value, 
the 
drama, 
sculpture 
and 
painting 
and 
all 
those 
arts 
which 
have 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
machine 
and 
depend 
entirely 
upon 
mental 
and 
spiritual 
inspiration 
will 
receive 
an 
impetus 
from 
the 
Communist 
faith. 
Whether 
the 
flowering 
period 
will 
be 
long 
or 
short 
depends 
partly 
on 
the 
political 
situation, 
but 
chiefly 
on 
the 
rapidity 
of 
industrial 
development. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
the 
machine 
will 
ultimately 
conquer 
the 
Communist 
faith 
and 
grind 
out 
the 
human 
impulses, 
and 
Russia 
become 
during 
this 
transition 
period 
as 
inartistic 



and 
soulless 
as 
was 
America 
until 
quite 
recent 
years. 
One 
would 
like 
to 
hope 
that 
mechanical 
progress 
will 
be 
swift 
and 
social 
idealism 
sufficiently 
strong 
to 
retain 
control. 
But 
the 
practical 
difficulties 
are 
almost 
insuperable. 


Such 
signs 
of 
the 
progress 
of 
art 
as 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
notice 
at 
this 
early 
stage 
would 
seem 
to 
bear 
out 
the 
above 
argument. 
For 
instance, 
an 
attempt 
is 
being 
made 
to 
foster 
the 
continuation 
of 
peasant 
embroidery, 
carving, 
&c., 
in 
the 
towns. 
It 
is 
done 
by 
people 
who 
have 
evidently 
lost 
the 
tradition 
already. 
They 
are 
taught 
to 
copy 
the 
models 
which 
are 
placed 
in 
the 
Peasant 
Museum, 
but 
there 
is 
no 
comparison 
between 
the 
live 
little 
wooden 
lady 
who 
smiles 
beneath 
the 
glass 
case, 
and 
the 
soulless 
staring-eyed 
creature 
who 
is 
offered 
for 
sale, 
nor 
between 
the 
quite 
ordinary 
carved 
fowl 
one 
may 
buy 
and 
the 
amusing 
life-like 
figure 
one 
may 
merely 
gaze 
at. 


But 
when 
one 
comes 
to 
art 
directly 
inspired 
by 
Communism 
it 
is 
a 
different 
story. 
Apart 
from 
the 
propaganda 
pictures 
already 
referred 
to, 
there 
are 
propaganda 
plays 
performed 
by 
the 
Red 
Army 
in 
its 
spare 
moments, 
and 
there 
are 
the 
mass 
pageant 
plays 
performed 
on 
State 
occasions. 
I 
had 
the 
good 
fortune 
to 
witness 
one 
of 
each 
kind. 


The 
play 
was 
called 
Zarevo 
(The 
Dawn), 
and 
was 
performed 
on 
a 
Saturday 
night 
on 
a 
small 
stage 
in 
a 
small 
hall 
in 
an 
entirely 
amateur 
fashion. 
It 
represented 
Russian 
life 
just 
before 
the 
revolution. 
It 
was 
intense 
and 
tragic 
and 
passionately 
acted. 
Dramatic 
talent 
is 
not 
rare 
in 
Russia. 
Almost 
the 
only 
comic 
relief 
was 
provided 
by 
the 
Tsarist 
police, 
who 
made 
one 
appearance 
towards 
the 
end, 
got 
up 
like 
comic 
military 
characters 
in 
a 
musical 
comedy-just 
as, 
in 
mediæval 
miracle 
plays, 
the 
comic 
character 
was 
Satan. 
The 
play's 
intention 
was 
to 
show 
a 
typical 
Russian 
working-class 
family. 
There 
were 
the 
old 
father, 
constantly 
drunk 
on 
vodka, 
alternately 
maudlin 
and 
scolding; 
the 
old 
mother; 
two 
sons, 
the 
one 
a 
Communist 
and 
the 
other 
an 
Anarchist; 
the 
wife 
of 
the 
Communist, 
who 
did 
dressmaking; 
her 
sister, 
a 
prostitute; 
and 
a 
young 
girl 
of 
bourgeois 
family, 
also 
a 
Communist, 
involved 
in 
a 
plot 
with 
the 
Communist 
son, 
who 
was 
of 
course 
the 
hero 
of 
the 
play. 


The 
first 
act 
revealed 
the 
stern 
and 
heroic 
Communist 
maintaining 
his 
views 
despite 
the 
reproaches 
of 
father 
and 
mother 
and 
the 
nagging 
of 
his 
wife. 
It 
showed 
also 
the 
Anarchist 
brother 
(as 
might 
be 
expected 
from 
the 
Bolshevik 
hostility 
to 
Anarchism) 
as 
an 
unruly, 
lazy, 
ne'er-do-well, 
with 
a 
passionate 
love 
for 
Sonia, 
the 
young 
bourgeoise, 
which 
was 
likely 
to 
become 
dangerous 
if 
not 
returned. 
She, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
obviously 
preferred 
the 
Communist. 
It 
was 
clear 
that 



he 
returned 
her 
love, 
but 
it 
was 
not 
quite 
clear 
that 
he 
would 
wish 
the 
relation 
to 
be 
anything 
more 
than 
platonic 
comradeship 
in 
the 
service 
of 
their 
common 
ideal. 
An 
unsuccessful 
strike, 
bringing 
want 
and 
danger 
from 
the 
police, 
together 
with 
increasing 
jealousy 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
Anarchist, 
led 
up 
to 
the 
tragic 
dénouement. 
I 
was 
not 
quite 
definite 
as 
to 
how 
this 
was 
brought 
about. 
All 
violent 
action 
was 
performed 
off 
the 
stage, 
and 
this 
made 
the 
plot 
at 
times 
difficult 
to 
follow. 
But 
it 
seemed 
that 
the 
Anarchist 
in 
a 
jealous 
rage 
forged 
a 
letter 
from 
his 
brother 
to 
bring 
Sonia 
to 
a 
rendezvous, 
and 
there 
murdered 
her, 
at 
the 
same 
time 
betraying 
his 
brother 
to 
the 
police. 
When 
the 
latter 
came 
to 
effect 
his 
arrest, 
and 
accuse 
him 
also, 
as 
the 
most 
likely 
person, 
of 
the 
murder, 
the 
Anarchist 
was 
seized 
with 
remorse 
and 
confessed. 
Both 
were 
therefore 
led 
away 
together. 
Once 
the 
plot 
is 
sketched, 
the 
play 
calls 
for 
no 
comment. 
It 
had 
not 
great 
merit, 
though 
it 
is 
unwise 
to 
hazard 
a 
judgment 
on 
a 
play 
whose 
dialogue 
was 
not 
fully 
interpreted, 
but 
it 
was 
certainly 
real, 
and 
the 
link 
between 
audience 
and 
performers 
was 
established 
as 
it 
never 
seemed 
to 
be 
in 
the 
professional 
theatre. 
After 
the 
performance, 
the 
floor 
was 
cleared 
for 
dancing, 
and 
the 
audience 
were 
in 
a 
mood 
of 
thorough 
enjoyment. 


The 
pageant 
of 
the 
"World 
Commune," 
which 
was 
performed 
at 
the 
opening 
of 
the 
Third 
International 
Congress 
in 
Petrograd, 
was 
a 
still 
more 
important 
and 
significant 
phenomenon. 
I 
do 
not 
suppose 
that 
anything 
of 
the 
kind 
has 
been 
staged 
since 
the 
days 
of 
the 
mediæval 
mystery 
plays. 
It 
was, 
in 
fact, 
a 
mystery 
play 
designed 
by 
the 
High 
Priests 
of 
the 
Communist 
faith 
to 
instruct 
the 
people. 
It 
was 
played 
on 
the 
steps 
of 
an 
immense 
white 
building 
that 
was 
once 
the 
Stock 
Exchange, 
a 
building 
with 
a 
classical 
colonnade 
on 
three 
sides 
of 
it, 
with 
a 
vast 
flight 
of 
steps 
in 
front, 
that 
did 
not 
extend 
the 
whole 
width 
of 
the 
building 
but 
left 
at 
each 
side 
a 
platform 
that 
was 
level 
with 
the 
floor 
of 
the 
colonnade. 
In 
front 
of 
this 
building 
a 
wide 
road 
ran 
from 
a 
bridge 
over 
one 
arm 
of 
the 
river 
to 
a 
bridge 
over 
the 
other, 
so 
that 
the 
stretches 
of 
water 
and 
sky 
on 
either 
side 
seemed 
to 
the 
eye 
of 
imagination 
like 
the 
painted 
wings 
of 
a 
gigantic 
stage. 
Two 
battered 
red 
columns 
of 
fantastic 
design, 
that 
were 
once 
light 
towers 
to 
guide 
ships, 
stood 
on 
either 
side 
midway 
between 
the 
extremities 
of 
the 
building 
and 
the 
water, 
but 
on 
the 
opposite 
side 
of 
the 
road. 
These 
two 
towers 
were 
beflagged 
and 
illuminated 
and 
carried 
the 
limelight, 
and 
between 
and 
behind 
them 
was 
gathered 
a 
densely 
packed 
audience 
of 
forty 
or 
fifty 
thousand 
people. 
The 
play 
began 
at 
sundown, 
while 
the 
sky 
was 



still 
red 
away 
to 
the 
right 
and 
the 
palaces 
on 
the 
far 
bank 
to 
the 
left 
still 
aglow 
with 
the 
setting 
sun, 
and 
it 
continued 
under 
the 
magic 
of 
the 
darkening 
sky. 
At 
first 
the 
beauty 
and 
grandeur 
of 
the 
setting 
drew 
the 
attention 
away 
from 
the 
performers, 
but 
gradually 
one 
became 
aware 
that 
on 
the 
platform 
before 
the 
columns 
kings 
and 
queens 
and 
courtiers 
in 
sumptuous 
conventional 
robes, 
and 
attended 
by 
soldiers, 
were 
conversing 
in 
dumb 
show 
with 
one 
another. 
A 
few 
climbed 
the 
steps 
of 
a 
small 
wooden 
platform 
that 
was 
set 
up 
in 
the 
middle, 
and 
one 
indicated 
by 
a 
lifted 
hand 
that 
here 
should 
be 
built 
a 
monument 
to 
the 
power 
of 
capitalism 
over 
the 
earth. 
All 
gave 
signs 
of 
delight. 
Sentimental 
music 
was 
heard, 
and 
the 
gay 
company 
fell 
to 
waltzing 
away 
the 
hours. 
Meanwhile, 
from 
below 
on 
the 
road 
level, 
there 
streamed 
out 
of 
the 
darkness 
on 
either 
side 
of 
the 
building 
and 
up 
the 
half-lit 
steps, 
their 
fetters 
ringing 
in 
harmony 
with 
the 
music, 
the 
enslaved 
and 
toiling 
masses 
coming 
in 
response 
to 
command 
to 
build 
the 
monument 
for 
their 
masters. 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
describe 
the 
exquisite 
beauty 
of 
the 
slow 
movement 
of 
those 
dark 
figures 
aslant 
the 
broad 
flight 
of 
steps; 
individual 
expressions 
were 
of 
course 
indistinguishable, 
and 
yet 
the 
movement 
and 
attitude 
of 
the 
groups 
conveyed 
pathos 
and 
patient 
endurance 
as 
well 
as 
any 
individual 
speech 
or 
gesture 
in 
the 
ordinary 
theatre. 
Some 
groups 
carried 
hammer 
and 
anvil, 
and 
others 
staggered 
under 
enormous 
blocks 
of 
stone. 
Love 
for 
the 
ballet 
has 
perhaps 
made 
the 
Russians 
understand 
the 
art 
of 
moving 
groups 
of 
actors 
in 
unison. 
As 
I 
watched 
these 
processions 
climbing 
the 
steps 
in 
apparently 
careless 
and 
spontaneous 
fashion, 
and 
yet 
producing 
so 
graceful 
a 
result, 
I 
remembered 
the 
mad 
leap 
of 
the 
archers 
down 
the 
stage 
in 
Prince 
Igor, 
which 
is 
also 
apparently 
careless 
and 
spontaneous 
and 
full 
of 
wild 
and 
irregular 
beauty, 
yet 
never 
varies 
a 
hair-breadth 
from 
one 
performance 
to 
the 
next. 


For 
a 
time 
the 
workers 
toiled 
in 
the 
shadow 
in 
their 
earthly 
world, 
and 
dancing 
continued 
in 
the 
lighted 
paradise 
of 
the 
rulers 
above, 
until 
presently, 
in 
sign 
that 
the 
monument 
was 
complete, 
a 
large 
yellow 
disc 
was 
hoisted 
amid 
acclamation 
above 
the 
highest 
platform 
between 
the 
columns. 
But 
at 
the 
same 
moment 
a 
banner 
was 
uplifted 
amongst 
the 
people, 
and 
a 
small 
figure 
was 
seen 
gesticulating. 
Angry 
fists 
were 
shaken 
and 
the 
banner 
and 
speaker 
disappeared, 
only 
to 
reappear 
almost 
immediately 
in 
another 
part 
of 
the 
dense 
crowd. 
Again 
hostility, 
until 
finally 
among 
the 
French 
workers 
away 
up 
on 
the 
right, 
the 
first 
Communist 
manifesto 
found 
favour. 
Rallying 
around 
their 
banner 
the 
communards 
ran 
shouting 
down 
the 
steps, 
gathering 
supporters 
as 



they 
came. 
Above, 
all 
is 
confusion, 
kings 
and 
queens 
scuttling 
in 
unroyal 
fashion 
with 
flying 
velvet 
robes 
to 
safe 
citadels 
right 
and 
left, 
while 
the 
army 
prepares 
to 
defend 
the 
main 
citadel 
of 
capitalism 
with 
its 
golden 
disc 
of 
power. 
The 
communards 
scale 
the 
steps 
to 
the 
fortress 
which 
they 
finally 
capture, 
haul 
down 
the 
disc 
and 
set 
their 
banner 
in 
its 
place. 
The 
merry 
music 
of 
the 
Carmagnole 
is 
heard, 
and 
the 
victors 
are 
seen 
expressing 
their 
delight 
by 
dancing 
first 
on 
one 
foot 
and 
then 
on 
the 
other, 
like 
marionettes. 
Below, 
the 
masses 
dance 
with 
them 
in 
a 
frenzy 
of 
joy. 
But 
a 
pompous 
procession 
of 
Prussian 
legions 
is 
seen 
approaching, 
and, 
amid 
shrieks 
and 
wails 
of 
despair, 
the 
people 
are 
driven 
back, 
and 
their 
leaders 
set 
in 
a 
row 
and 
shot. 
Thereafter 
came 
one 
of 
the 
most 
moving 
scenes 
in 
the 
drama. 
Several 
dark-clad 
women 
appeared 
carrying 
a 
black 
pall 
supported 
on 
sticks, 
which 
they 
set 
in 
front 
of 
the 
bodies 
of 
the 
leaders 
so 
that 
it 
stood 
out, 
an 
irregular 
pointed 
black 
shape 
against 
the 
white 
columns 
behind. 
But 
for 
this 
melancholy 
monument 
the 
stage 
was 
now 
empty. 
Thick 
clouds 
of 
black 
smoke 
arose 
from 
braziers 
on 
either 
side 
and 
obscured 
the 
steps 
and 
the 
platform. 
Through 
the 
smoke 
came 
the 
distant 
sound 
of 
Chopin's 
Marche 
Funèbre, 
and 
as 
the 
air 
became 
clearer 
white 
figures 
could 
be 
dimly 
seen 
moving 
around 
the 
black 
pall 
in 
a 
solemn 
dance 
of 
mourning. 
Behind 
them 
the 
columns 
shone 
ghostly 
and 
unreal 
against 
the 
glimmering 
mauve 
rays 
of 
an 
uncertain 
and 
watery 
dawn. 


The 
second 
part 
of 
the 
pageant 
opened 
in 
July 
1914. 
Once 
again 
the 
rulers 
were 
feasting 
and 
the 
workers 
at 
toil, 
but 
the 
scene 
was 
enlivened 
by 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
leaders 
of 
the 
Second 
International, 
a 
group 
of 
decrepit 
professorial 
old 
men, 
who 
waddled 
in 
in 
solemn 
procession 
carrying 
tomes 
full 
of 
international 
learning. 
They 
sat 
in 
a 
row 
between 
the 
rulers 
and 
the 
people, 
deep 
in 
study, 
spectacles 
on 
nose. 
The 
call 
to 
war 
was 
the 
signal 
for 
a 
dramatic 
appeal 
from 
the 
workers 
to 
these 
leaders, 
who 
refused 
to 
accept 
the 
Red 
Flag, 
but 
weakly 
received 
patriotic 
flags 
from 
their 
respective 
governments. 
Jaurès, 
elevated 
to 
be 
the 
symbol 
of 
protest, 
towered 
above 
the 
people, 
crying 
in 
a 
loud 
voice, 
but 
fell 
back 
immediately 
as 
the 
assassin's 
shot 
rang 
out. 
Then 
the 
people 
divided 
into 
their 
national 
groups 
and 
the 
war 
began. 
It 
was 
at 
this 
point 
that 
"God 
Save 
the 
King" 
was 
played 
as 
the 
English 
soldiers 
marched 
out, 
in 
a 
comic 
manner 
which 
made 
one 
think 
of 
it 
as 
"Gawd 
save 
the 
King." 
Other 
national 
anthems 
were 
burlesqued 
in 
a 
similar 
fashion, 
but 
none 
quite 
so 
successfully. 
A 
ridiculous 
effigy 
of 
the 
Tsar 
with 
a 
knout 
in 
his 



hand 
now 
occupied 
the 
symbolic 
position 
and 
dominated 
the 
scene. 
The 
incidents 
of 
the 
war 
which 
affected 
Russia 
were 
then 
played. 
Spectacular 
cavalry 
charges 
on 
the 
road, 
marching 
soldiers, 
batteries 
of 
artillery, 
a 
pathetic 
procession 
of 
cripples 
and 
nurses, 
and 
other 
scenes 
too 
numerous 
to 
describe, 
made 
up 
that 
part 
of 
the 
pageant 
devoted 
to 
the 
war. 


Then 
came 
the 
Russian 
Revolution 
in 
all 
its 
stages. 
Cars 
dashed 
by 
full 
of 
armed 
men, 
red 
flags 
appeared 
everywhere, 
the 
people 
stormed 
the 
citadel 
and 
hauled 
down 
the 
effigy 
of 
the 
Tsar. 
The 
Kerensky 
Government 
assumed 
control 
and 
drove 
them 
forth 
to 
war 
again, 
but 
soon 
they 
returned 
to 
the 
charge, 
destroyed 
the 
Provisional 
Government, 
and 
hoisted 
all 
the 
emblems 
of 
the 
Russian 
Soviet 
Republic. 
The 
Entente 
leaders, 
however, 
were 
seen 
preparing 
their 
troops 
for 
battle, 
and 
the 
pageant 
went 
on 
to 
show 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
Red 
Army 
under 
its 
emblem 
the 
Red 
Star. 
White 
figures 
with 
golden 
trumpets 
appeared 
foretelling 
victory 
for 
the 
proletariat. 
The 
last 
scene, 
the 
World 
Commune, 
is 
described 
in 
the 
words 
of 
the 
abstract, 
taken 
from 
a 
Russian 
newspaper, 
as 
follows:-


Cannon 
shots 
announce 
the 
breaking 
of 
the 
blockade 
against 
Soviet 
Russia, 
and 
the 
victory 
of 
the 
World 
Proletariat. 
The 
Red 
Army 
returns 
from 
the 
front, 
and 
passes 
in 
triumphant 
review 
before 
the 
leaders 
of 
the 
Revolution. 
At 
their 
feet 
lie 
the 
crowns 
of 
kings 
and 
the 
gold 
of 
the 
bankers. 
Ships 
draped 
with 
flags 
are 
seen 
carrying 
workers 
from 
the 
west. 
The 
workers 
of 
the 
whole 
world, 
with 
the 
emblems 
of 
labour, 
gather 
for 
the 
celebration 
of 
the 
World 
Commune. 
In 
the 
heavens 
luminous 
inscriptions 
in 
different 
languages 
appear, 
greeting 
the 
Congress: 
"Long 
live 
the 
Third 
International! 
Workers 
of 
the 
world, 
unite! 
Triumph 
to 
the 
sounds 
of 
the 
hymn 
of 
the 
World 
Commune, 
the 
'International'." 


Even 
so 
glowing 
an 
account, 
however, 
hardly 
does 
it 
justice. 
It 
had 
the 
pomp 
and 
majesty 
of 
the 
Day 
of 
Judgment 
itself. 
Rockets 
climbed 
the 
skies 
and 
peppered 
them 
with 
a 
thousand 
stars, 
fireworks 
blazed 
on 
all 
sides, 
garlanded 
and 
beflagged 
ships 
moved 
up 
and 
down 
the 
river, 
chariots 
bearing 
the 
emblems 
of 
prosperity, 
grapes 
and 
corn, 
travelled 
slowly 
along 
the 
road. 
The 
Eastern 
peoples 
came 
carrying 
gifts 
and 
emblems. 
The 
actors, 
massed 
upon 
the 
steps, 
waved 
triumphant 
hands, 
trumpets 
sounded, 
and 
the 
song 
of 
the 
International 
from 
ten 
thousand 
throats 
rose 
like 
a 
mighty 
wave 
engulfing 
the 
whole. 


Though 
the 
end 
of 
this 
drama 
may 
have 
erred 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
grandiose, 
this 
may 
perhaps 
be 
forgiven 
the 
organizers 
in 
view 
of 
the 



occasion 
for 
which 
they 
prepared 
it. 
Nothing, 
however, 
could 
detract 
from 
the 
beauty 
and 
dramatic 
power 
of 
the 
opening 
and 
of 
many 
of 
the 
scenes. 
Moreover, 
the 
effects 
obtained 
by 
movement 
in 
the 
mass 
were 
almost 
intoxicating. 
The 
first 
entrance 
of 
the 
masses 
gave 
a 
sense 
of 
dumb 
and 
patient 
force 
that 
was 
moving 
in 
the 
extreme, 
and 
the 
frenzied 
delight 
of 
the 
dancing 
crowd 
at 
the 
victory 
of 
the 
French 
communards 
stirred 
one 
to 
ecstasy. 
The 
pageant 
lasted 
for 
five 
hours 
or 
more, 
and 
was 
as 
exhausting 
emotionally 
as 
the 
Passion 
Play 
is 
said 
to 
be. 
I 
had 
the 
vision 
of 
a 
great 
period 
of 
Communist 
art, 
more 
especially 
of 
such 
open-air 
spectacles, 
which 
should 
have 
the 
grandeur 
and 
scope 
and 
eternal 
meaning 
of 
the 
plays 
of 
ancient 
Greece, 
the 
mediæval 
mysteries, 
or 
the 
Shakespearean 
theatre. 
In 
building, 
writing, 
acting, 
even 
in 
painting, 
work 
would 
be 
done, 
as 
it 
once 
was, 
by 
groups, 
not 
by 
one 
hand 
or 
mind, 
and 
evolution 
would 
proceed 
slowly 
until 
once 
again 
the 
individual 
emerged 
from 
the 
mass. 


In 
considering 
Education 
under 
the 
Bolshevik 
régime, 
the 
same 
two 
factors 
which 
I 
have 
already 
dealt 
with 
in 
discussing 
art, 
namely 
industrial 
development 
and 
the 
communist 
doctrine, 
must 
be 
taken 
into 
account. 
Industrial 
development 
is 
in 
reality 
one 
of 
the 
tenets 
of 
Communism, 
but 
as 
it 
is 
one 
which 
in 
Russia 
is 
likely 
to 
endanger 
the 
doctrine 
as 
a 
whole 
I 
have 
thought 
it 
better 
to 
consider 
it 
as 
a 
separate 
item. 


As 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
art, 
so 
in 
education, 
those 
who 
have 
given 
unqualified 
praise 
seem 
to 
have 
taken 
the 
short 
and 
superficial 
view. 
It 
is 
hardly 
necessary 
to 
launch 
into 
descriptions 
of 
the 
crèches, 
country 
homes 
or 
palaces 
for 
children, 
where 
Montessori 
methods 
prevail, 
where 
the 
pupils 
cultivate 
their 
little 
gardens, 
model 
in 
plasticine, 
draw 
and 
sing 
and 
act, 
and 
dance 
their 
Eurythmic 
dances 
barefoot 
on 
floors 
once 
sacred 
to 
the 
tread 
of 
the 
nobility. 
I 
saw 
a 
reception 
and 
distributing 
house 
in 
Petrograd 
with 
which 
no 
fault 
could 
be 
found 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
scientific 
organization. 
The 
children 
were 
bright-eyed 
and 
merry, 
and 
the 
rooms 
airy 
and 
clean. 
I 
saw, 
too, 
a 
performance 
by 
school 
children 
in 
Moscow 
which 
included 
some 
quite 
wonderful 
Eurythmic 
dancing, 
in 
particular 
an 
interpretation 
of 
Grieg's 
Tanz 
in 
der 
Halle 
des 
Bergkönigs 
by 
the 
Dalcroze 
method, 
but 
with 
a 
colour 
and 
warmth 
which 
were 
Russian, 
and 
in 
odd 
contrast 
to 
the 
mathematical 
precision 
associated 
with 
most 
Dalcroze 
performances. 


But 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
obvious 
merit 
of 
such 
institutions 
as 
exist, 
misgivings 
would 
arise. 
To 
begin 
with, 
it 
must 
be 
remembered 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
first 
to 



admit 
that 
children 
should 
be 
delivered 
up 
almost 
entirely 
to 
the 
State. 
Nominally, 
the 
mother 
still 
comes 
to 
see 
her 
child 
in 
these 
schools, 
but 
in 
actual 
fact, 
the 
drafting 
of 
children 
to 
the 
country 
must 
intervene, 
and 
the 
whole 
temper 
of 
the 
authorities 
seemed 
to 
be 
directed 
towards 
breaking 
the 
link 
between 
mother 
and 
child. 
To 
some 
this 
will 
seem 
an 
advantage, 
and 
it 
is 
a 
point 
which 
admits 
of 
lengthy 
discussion, 
but 
as 
it 
belongs 
rather 
to 
the 
question 
of 
women 
and 
the 
family 
under 
Communism, 
I 
can 
do 
no 
more 
than 
mention 
it 
here. 


Then, 
again, 
it 
must 
be 
remembered 
that 
the 
tactics 
of 
the 
Bolsheviks 
towards 
such 
schools 
as 
existed 
under 
the 
old 
régime 
in 
provincial 
towns 
and 
villages, 
have 
not 
been 
the 
same 
as 
their 
tactics 
towards 
the 
theatres. 
The 
greater 
number 
of 
these 
schools 
are 
closed, 
in 
part, 
it 
would 
seem, 
from 
lack 
of 
personnel, 
and 
in 
part 
from 
fear 
of 
counter-revolutionary 
propaganda. 
The 
result 
is 
that, 
though 
those 
schools 
which 
they 
have 
created 
are 
good 
and 
organized 
on 
modern 
lines, 
on 
the 
whole 
there 
would 
seem 
to 
be 
less 
diffusion 
of 
child 
education 
than 
before. 
In 
this, 
as 
in 
most 
other 
departments, 
the 
Bolsheviks 
show 
themselves 
loath 
to 
attempt 
anything 
which 
cannot 
be 
done 
on 
a 
large 
scale 
and 
impregnated 
with 
Communist 
doctrine. 
It 
goes 
without 
saying 
that 
Communist 
doctrine 
is 
taught 
in 
schools, 
as 
Christianity 
has 
been 
taught 
hitherto, 
moreover 
the 
Communist 
teachers 
show 
bitter 
hostility 
to 
other 
teachers 
who 
do 
not 
accept 
the 
doctrine. 
At 
the 
children's 
entertainment 
alluded 
to 
above, 
the 
dances 
and 
poems 
performed 
had 
nearly 
all 
some 
close 
relation 
to 
Communism, 
and 
a 
teacher 
addressed 
the 
children 
for 
something 
like 
an 
hour 
and 
a 
half 
on 
the 
duties 
of 
Communists 
and 
the 
errors 
of 
Anarchism. 


This 
teaching 
of 
Communism, 
however 
necessary 
it 
may 
appear 
for 
the 
building 
of 
the 
Communist 
state 
of 
the 
future, 
does 
seem 
to 
me 
to 
be 
an 
evil 
in 
that 
it 
is 
done 
emotionally 
and 
fanatically, 
with 
an 
appeal 
to 
hate 
and 
militant 
ardour 
rather 
than 
to 
constructive 
reason. 
It 
binds 
the 
free 
intellect 
and 
destroys 
initiative. 
An 
industrial 
state 
needs 
not 
only 
obedient 
and 
patient 
workers 
and 
artists, 
it 
needs 
also 
men 
and 
women 
with 
initiative 
in 
scientific 
research. 
It 
is 
idle 
to 
provide 
channels 
for 
scientific 
research 
later 
if 
it 
is 
to 
be 
choked 
at 
the 
source. 
That 
source 
is 
an 
enquiring 
and 
free 
intellect 
unhampered 
by 
iron 
dogma. 
Beneficial 
to 
artistic 
and 
emotional 
development 
therefore, 
the 
teaching 
of 
Communism 
as 
a 
faith 
may 
well 
be 
most 
pernicious 
to 
the 
scientific 
and 
intellectual 
side 
of 
education, 
and 
will 
lead 
direct 
to 
the 
pragmatist 
view 
of 
knowledge 
and 
scientific 
research 
which 
the 
Church 
and 



the 
capitalist 
already 
find 
it 
so 
convenient 
to 
adopt. 


But 
to 
come 
to 
the 
chief 
and 
most 
practical 
question, 
the 
relation 
of 
education 
to 
industry. 
Sooner 
or 
later 
education 
in 
Russia 
must 
become 
subordinate 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
industrial 
development. 
That 
the 
Bolsheviks 
already 
realize 
this 
is 
proved 
by 
the 
articles 
of 
Lunacharsky 
which 
recently 
appeared 
in 
Le 
Phare 
(Geneva). 
It 
was 
the 
spectre 
of 
industry 
that 
haunted 
me 
throughout 
the 
consideration 
of 
education 
as 
in 
the 
consideration 
of 
art, 
and 
what 
I 
have 
said 
above 
of 
its 
dangers 
to 
the 
latter 
seems 
to 
me 
also 
to 
apply 
here. 
Montessori 
schools 
belong, 
in 
my 
view, 
to 
that 
stage 
in 
industrial 
development 
when 
education 
is 
directed 
as 
much 
towards 
leisure 
occupations 
as 
towards 
preparation 
for 
professional 
life. 
Possibly 
the 
fine 
flower 
of 
useless 
scientific 
enquiry 
belongs 
to 
this 
stage 
also. 
Nobody 
in 
Russia 
is 
likely 
to 
have 
much 
leisure 
for 
a 
good 
many 
years 
to 
come, 
if 
the 
Bolshevik 
programme 
of 
industrial 
development 
is 
efficiently 
carried 
out. 
And 
there 
seemed 
to 
me 
to 
be 
something 
pathetic 
and 
almost 
cruel 
in 
this 
varied 
and 
agreeable 
education 
of 
the 
child, 
when 
one 
reflected 
on 
the 
long 
hours 
of 
grinding 
toil 
to 
which 
he 
was 
soon 
to 
be 
subject 
in 
workshop 
or 
factory. 
For 
I 
repeat 
that 
I 
do 
not 
believe 
industrial 
work 
in 
the 
early 
days 
of 
industry 
can 
be 
made 
tolerable 
to 
the 
worker. 
Once 
again 
I 
experienced 
the 
dread 
of 
seeing 
the 
ideals 
of 
the 
Russian 
revolutionaries 
go 
down 
before 
the 
logic 
of 
necessity. 
They 
are 
beginning 
to 
pride 
themselves 
on 
being 
hard, 
practical 
men, 
and 
it 
seems 
quite 
reasonable 
to 
fear 
that 
they 
should 
come 
to 
regard 
this 
full 
and 
humane 
development 
of 
the 
child 
as 
a 
mere 
luxury 
and 
ultimately 
neglect 
it. 
Worse 
still, 
the 
few 
of 
these 
schools 
which 
already 
exist 
may 
perhaps 
become 
exclusive 
to 
the 
Communists 
and 
their 
children, 
or 
that 
company 
of 
Samurai 
which 
is 
to 
leaven 
and 
govern 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
people. 
If 
so, 
they 
will 
soon 
come 
to 
resemble 
our 
public 
schools, 
in 
that 
they 
will 
prepare, 
in 
an 
artificial 
play 
atmosphere, 
men 
who 
will 
pass 
straight 
to 
the 
position 
of 
leaders, 
while 
the 
portion 
of 
the 
proletariat 
who 
serve 
under 
them 
will 
be 
reading 
and 
writing, 
just 
so 
much 
technical 
training 
as 
is 
necessary, 
and 
Communist 
doctrine. 


This 
is 
a 
nightmare 
hypothesis, 
but 
the 
difficulties 
of 
the 
practical 
problem 
seem 
to 
warrant 
its 
entertainment. 
The 
number 
of 
people 
in 
Russia 
who 
can 
even 
read 
and 
write 
is 
extremely 
small, 
the 
need 
to 
get 
them 
employed 
industrially 
as 
rapidly 
as 
possible 
is 
very 
great, 
hence 
the 
system 
of 
education 
which 
develops 
out 
of 
this 
situation 
cannot 
be 
very 
ambitious 
or 



enlightened. 
Further 
it 
will 
have 
to 
continue 
over 
a 
sufficiently 
long 
period 
of 
time 
to 
allow 
of 
the 
risk 
of 
its 
becoming 
stable 
and 
traditional. 
In 
adult 
education 
already 
the 
pupil 
comes 
for 
a 
short 
period, 
learns 
Communism, 
reading 
and 
writing--there 
is 
hardly 
time 
to 
give 
him 
much 
more--and 
returns 
to 
leaven 
the 
army 
or 
his 
native 
village. 
In 
achieving 
this 
the 
Bolsheviks 
are 
already 
doing 
a 
very 
important 
and 
valuable 
work, 
but 
they 
cannot 
hope 
for 
a 
long 
while 
to 
become 
the 
model 
of 
public 
instruction 
which 
they 
have 
hitherto 
been 
represented 
to 
be. 
And 
the 
conditions 
of 
their 
becoming 
so 
ultimately 
are 
adherence 
to 
their 
ideals 
through 
a 
very 
long 
period 
of 
stress, 
and 
a 
lessening 
of 
fanaticism 
in 
their 
Communist 
teaching, 
conditions 
which, 
unhappily, 
seem 
to 
be 
mutually 
incompatible. 


The 
whole 
of 
the 
argument 
set 
out 
in 
this 
chapter 
may 
be 
summed 
up 
in 
the 
statement 
of 
one 
fact 
which 
the 
mere 
idealist 
is 
prone 
to 
overlook, 
namely 
that 
Russia 
is 
a 
country 
at 
a 
stage 
in 
economic 
development 
not 
much 
more 
advanced 
than 
America 
in 
the 
pioneer 
days. 
The 
old 
civilization 
was 
aristocratic 
and 
exotic; 
it 
could 
not 
survive 
in 
the 
modern 
world. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
it 
produced 
great 
men, 
but 
its 
foundations 
were 
rotten. 
The 
new 
civilization 
may, 
for 
the 
moment, 
be 
less 
productive 
of 
individual 
works 
of 
genius, 
but 
it 
has 
a 
new 
solidity 
and 
gives 
promise 
of 
a 
new 
unity. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
I 
have 
taken 
too 
hopeful 
a 
view 
and 
that 
the 
future 
evolution 
of 
Russia 
will 
have 
as 
little 
connection 
with 
the 
life 
and 
tradition 
of 
its 
present 
population 
as 
modern 
America 
with 
the 
life 
of 
the 
Red 
Indian 
tribes. 
The 
fact 
that 
there 
exists 
in 
Russia 
a 
population 
at 
a 
far 
higher 
stage 
of 
culture, 
which 
will 
be 
industrially 
educated, 
not 
exterminated, 
militates 
against 
this 
hypothesis, 
but 
the 
need 
for 
education 
may 
make 
progress 
slower 
than 
it 
was 
in 
the 
United 
States. 


One 
would 
not 
have 
looked 
for 
the 
millennium 
of 
Communism, 
nor 
even 
for 
valuable 
art 
and 
educational 
experiment 
in 
the 
America 
of 
early 
railroading 
and 
farming 
days. 
Nor 
must 
one 
look 
for 
such 
things 
from 
Russia 
yet. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
during 
the 
next 
hundred 
years 
there, 
economic 
evolution 
will 
obscure 
Communist 
ideals, 
until 
finally, 
in 
a 
country 
that 
has 
reached 
the 
stage 
of 
present-day 
America, 
the 
battle 
will 
be 
fought 
out 
again 
to 
a 
victorious 
and 
stable 
issue. 
Unless, 
indeed, 
the 
Marxian 
scripture 
prove 
to 
be 
not 
infallible, 
and 
faith 
and 
heroic 
devotion 
show 
themselves 
capable 
of 
triumphing 
over 
economic 
necessity. 


V 



COMMUNISM 
AND 
THE 
SOVIET 
CONSTITUTION 


Before 
I 
went 
to 
Russia 
I 
imagined 
that 
I 
was 
going 
to 
see 
an 
interesting 
experiment 
in 
a 
new 
form 
of 
representative 
government. 
I 
did 
see 
an 
interesting 
experiment, 
but 
not 
in 
representative 
government. 
Every 
one 
who 
is 
interested 
in 
Bolshevism 
knows 
the 
series 
of 
elections, 
from 
the 
village 
meeting 
to 
the 
All-Russian 
Soviet, 
by 
which 
the 
people's 
commissaries 
are 
supposed 
to 
derive 
their 
power. 
We 
were 
told 
that, 
by 
the 
recall, 
the 
occupational 
constituencies, 
and 
so 
on, 
a 
new 
and 
far 
more 
perfect 
machinery 
had 
been 
devised 
for 
ascertaining 
and 
registering 
the 
popular 
will. 
One 
of 
the 
things 
we 
hoped 
to 
study 
was 
the 
question 
whether 
the 
Soviet 
system 
is 
really 
superior 
to 
Parliamentarism 
in 
this 
respect. 


We 
were 
not 
able 
to 
make 
any 
such 
study, 
because 
the 
Soviet 
system 
is 
moribund.[4] 
No 
conceivable 
system 
of 
free 
election 
would 
give 
majorities 
to 
the 
Communists, 
either 
in 
town 
or 
country. 
Various 
methods 
are 
therefore 
adopted 
for 
giving 
the 
victory 
to 
Government 
candidates. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
the 
voting 
is 
by 
show 
of 
hands, 
so 
that 
all 
who 
vote 
against 
the 
Government 
are 
marked 
men. 
In 
the 
second 
place, 
no 
candidate 
who 
is 
not 
a 
Communist 
can 
have 
any 
printing 
done, 
the 
printing 
works 
being 
all 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
State. 
In 
the 
third 
place, 
he 
cannot 
address 
any 
meetings, 
because 
the 
halls 
all 
belong 
to 
the 
State. 
The 
whole 
of 
the 
press 
is, 
of 
course, 
official; 
no 
independent 
daily 
is 
permitted. 
In 
spite 
of 
all 
these 
obstacles, 
the 
Mensheviks 
have 
succeeded 
in 
winning 
about 
40 
seats 
out 
of 
1,500 
on 
the 
Moscow 
Soviet, 
by 
being 
known 
in 
certain 
large 
factories 
where 
the 
electoral 
campaign 
could 
be 
conducted 
by 
word 
of 
mouth. 
They 
won, 
in 
fact, 
every 
seat 
that 
they 
contested. 


But 
although 
the 
Moscow 
Soviet 
is 
nominally 
sovereign 
in 
Moscow, 
it 
is 
really 
only 
a 
body 
of 
electors 
who 
choose 
the 
executive 
committee 
of 
forty, 
out 
of 
which, 
in 
turn, 
is 
chosen 
the 
Presidium, 
consisting 
of 
nine 
men 
who 
have 
all 
the 
power. 
The 
Moscow 
Soviet, 
as 
a 
whole, 
meets 
rarely; 
the 
Executive 
Committee 
is 
supposed 
to 
meet 
once 
a 
week, 
but 
did 
not 
meet 
while 
we 
were 
in 
Moscow. 
The 
Presidium, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
meets 
daily. 
Of 
course, 
it 
is 
easy 
for 
the 
Government 
to 
exercise 
pressure 
over 
the 
election 
of 
the 
executive 
committee, 
and 
again 
over 
the 
election 
of 
the 
Presidium. 
It 
must 
be 
remembered 
that 
effective 
protest 
is 
impossible, 
owing 
to 
the 
absolutely 
complete 
suppression 
of 
free 
speech 
and 
free 
Press. 
The 
result 
is 
that 
the 
Presidium 
of 
the 
Moscow 
Soviet 
consists 
only 
of 
orthodox 
Communists. 


Kamenev, 
the 
President 
of 
the 
Moscow 
Soviet, 
informed 
us 
that 
the 
recall 



is 
very 
frequently 
employed; 
he 
said 
that 
in 
Moscow 
there 
are, 
on 
an 
average, 
thirty 
recalls 
a 
month. 
I 
asked 
him 
what 
were 
the 
principal 
reasons 
for 
the 
recall, 
and 
he 
mentioned 
four: 
drinking, 
going 
to 
the 
front 
(and 
being, 
therefore, 
incapable 
of 
performing 
the 
duties), 
change 
of 
politics 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
electors, 
and 
failure 
to 
make 
a 
report 
to 
the 
electors 
once 
a 
fortnight, 
which 
all 
members 
of 
the 
Soviet 
are 
expected 
to 
do. 
It 
is 
evident 
that 
the 
recall 
affords 
opportunities 
for 
governmental 
pressure, 
but 
I 
had 
no 
chance 
of 
finding 
out 
whether 
it 
is 
used 
for 
this 
purpose. 


In 
country 
districts 
the 
method 
employed 
is 
somewhat 
different. 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
secure 
that 
the 
village 
Soviet 
shall 
consist 
of 
Communists, 
because, 
as 
a 
rule, 
at 
any 
rate 
in 
the 
villages 
I 
saw, 
there 
are 
no 
Communists. 
But 
when 
I 
asked 
in 
the 
villages 
how 
they 
were 
represented 
on 
the 
Volost 
(the 
next 
larger 
area) 
or 
the 
Gubernia, 
I 
was 
met 
always 
with 
the 
reply 
that 
they 
were 
not 
represented 
at 
all. 
I 
could 
not 
verify 
this, 
and 
it 
is 
probably 
an 
overstatement, 
but 
all 
concurred 
in 
the 
assertion 
that 
if 
they 
elected 
a 
non-Communist 
representative 
he 
could 
not 
obtain 
a 
pass 
on 
the 
railway 
and, 
therefore, 
could 
not 
attend 
the 
Volost 
or 
Gubernia 
Soviet. 
I 
saw 
a 
meeting 
of 
the 
Gubernia 
Soviet 
of 
Saratov. 
The 
representation 
is 
so 
arranged 
that 
the 
town 
workers 
have 
an 
enormous 
preponderance 
over 
the 
surrounding 
peasants; 
but 
even 
allowing 
for 
this, 
the 
proportion 
of 
peasants 
seemed 
astonishingly 
small 
for 
the 
centre 
of 
a 
very 
important 
agricultural 
area. 


The 
All-Russian 
Soviet, 
which 
is 
constitutionally 
the 
supreme 
body, 
to 
which 
the 
People's 
Commissaries 
are 
responsible, 
meets 
seldom, 
and 
has 
become 
increasingly 
formal. 
Its 
sole 
function 
at 
present, 
so 
far 
as 
I 
could 
discover, 
is 
to 
ratify, 
without 
discussion, 
previous 
decisions 
of 
the 
Communist 
Party 
on 
matters 
(especially 
concerning 
foreign 
policy) 
upon 
which 
the 
constitution 
requires 
its 
decision. 


All 
real 
power 
is 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
Communist 
Party, 
who 
number 
about 
600,000 
in 
a 
population 
of 
about 
120 
millions. 
I 
never 
came 
across 
a 
Communist 
by 
chance: 
the 
people 
whom 
I 
met 
in 
the 
streets 
or 
in 
the 
villages, 
when 
I 
could 
get 
into 
conversation 
with 
them, 
almost 
invariably 
said 
they 
were 
of 
no 
party. 
The 
only 
other 
answer 
I 
ever 
had 
was 
from 
some 
of 
the 
peasants, 
who 
openly 
stated 
that 
they 
were 
Tsarists. 
It 
must 
be 
said 
that 
the 
peasants' 
reasons 
for 
disliking 
the 
Bolsheviks 
are 
very 
inadequate. 
It 
is 
said-and 
all 
I 
saw 
confirmed 
the 
assertion--that 
the 
peasants 
are 
better 
off 
than 
they 
ever 
were 
before. 
I 
saw 
no 
one--man, 
woman, 
or 
child--who 
looked 



underfed 
in 
the 
villages. 
The 
big 
landowners 
are 
dispossessed, 
and 
the 
peasants 
have 
profited. 
But 
the 
towns 
and 
the 
army 
still 
need 
nourishing, 
and 
the 
Government 
has 
nothing 
to 
give 
the 
peasants 
in 
return 
for 
food 
except 
paper, 
which 
the 
peasants 
resent 
having 
to 
take. 
It 
is 
a 
singular 
fact 
that 
Tsarist 
roubles 
are 
worth 
ten 
times 
as 
much 
as 
Soviet 
roubles, 
and 
are 
much 
commoner 
in 
the 
country. 
Although 
they 
are 
illegal, 
pocket-books 
full 
of 
them 
are 
openly 
displayed 
in 
the 
market 
places. 
I 
do 
not 
think 
it 
should 
be 
inferred 
that 
the 
peasants 
expect 
a 
Tsarist 
restoration: 
they 
are 
merely 
actuated 
by 
custom 
and 
dislike 
of 
novelty. 
They 
have 
never 
heard 
of 
the 
blockade; 
consequently 
they 
cannot 
understand 
why 
the 
Government 
is 
unable 
to 
give 
them 
the 
clothes 
and 
agricultural 
implements 
that 
they 
need. 
Having 
got 
their 
land, 
and 
being 
ignorant 
of 
affairs 
outside 
their 
own 
neighbourhood, 
they 
wish 
their 
own 
village 
to 
be 
independent, 
and 
would 
resent 
the 
demands 
of 
any 
Government 
whatever. 


Within 
the 
Communist 
Party 
there 
are, 
of 
course, 
as 
always 
in 
a 
bureaucracy, 
different 
factions, 
though 
hitherto 
the 
external 
pressure 
has 
prevented 
disunion. 
It 
seemed 
to 
me 
that 
the 
personnel 
of 
the 
bureaucracy 
could 
be 
divided 
into 
three 
classes. 
There 
are 
first 
the 
old 
revolutionists, 
tested 
by 
years 
of 
persecution. 
These 
men 
have 
most 
of 
the 
highest 
posts. 
Prison 
and 
exile 
have 
made 
them 
tough 
and 
fanatical 
and 
rather 
out 
of 
touch 
with 
their 
own 
country. 
They 
are 
honest 
men, 
with 
a 
profound 
belief 
that 
Communism 
will 
regenerate 
the 
world. 
They 
think 
themselves 
utterly 
free 
from 
sentiment, 
but, 
in 
fact, 
they 
are 
sentimental 
about 
Communism 
and 
about 
the 
régime 
that 
they 
are 
creating; 
they 
cannot 
face 
the 
fact 
that 
what 
they 
are 
creating 
is 
not 
complete 
Communism, 
and 
that 
Communism 
is 
anathema 
to 
the 
peasant, 
who 
wants 
his 
own 
land 
and 
nothing 
else. 
They 
are 
pitiless 
in 
punishing 
corruption 
or 
drunkenness 
when 
they 
find 
either 
among 
officials; 
but 
they 
have 
built 
up 
a 
system 
in 
which 
the 
temptations 
to 
petty 
corruption 
are 
tremendous, 
and 
their 
own 
materialistic 
theory 
should 
persuade 
them 
that 
under 
such 
a 
system 
corruption 
must 
be 
rampant. 


The 
second 
class 
in 
the 
bureaucracy, 
among 
whom 
are 
to 
be 
found 
most 
of 
the 
men 
occupying 
political 
posts 
just 
below 
the 
top, 
consists 
of 
arrivistes, 
who 
are 
enthusiastic 
Bolsheviks 
because 
of 
the 
material 
success 
of 
Bolshevism. 
With 
them 
must 
be 
reckoned 
the 
army 
of 
policemen, 
spies, 
and 
secret 
agents, 
largely 
inherited 
from 
the 
Tsarist 
times, 
who 
make 
their 
profit 
out 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
no 
one 
can 
live 
except 
by 
breaking 
the 
law. 
This 
aspect 
of 
Bolshevism 
is 
exemplified 
by 
the 
Extraordinary 
Commission, 
a 
body 



practically 
independent 
of 
the 
Government, 
possessing 
its 
own 
regiments, 
who 
are 
better 
fed 
than 
the 
Red 
Army. 
This 
body 
has 
the 
power 
of 
imprisoning 
any 
man 
or 
woman 
without 
trial 
on 
such 
charges 
as 
speculation 
or 
counter-revolutionary 
activity. 
It 
has 
shot 
thousands 
without 
proper 
trial, 
and 
though 
now 
it 
has 
nominally 
lost 
the 
power 
of 
inflicting 
the 
death 
penalty, 
it 
is 
by 
no 
means 
certain 
that 
it 
has 
altogether 
lost 
it 
in 
fact. 
It 
has 
spies 
everywhere, 
and 
ordinary 
mortals 
live 
in 
terror 
of 
it. 


The 
third 
class 
in 
the 
bureaucracy 
consists 
of 
men 
who 
are 
not 
ardent 
Communists, 
who 
have 
rallied 
to 
the 
Government 
since 
it 
has 
proved 
itself 
stable, 
and 
who 
work 
for 
it 
either 
out 
of 
patriotism 
or 
because 
they 
enjoy 
the 
opportunity 
of 
developing 
their 
ideas 
freely 
without 
the 
obstacle 
of 
traditional 
institutions. 
Among 
this 
class 
are 
to 
be 
found 
men 
of 
the 
type 
of 
the 
successful 
business 
man, 
men 
with 
the 
same 
sort 
of 
ability 
as 
is 
found 
in 
the 
American 
self-made 
Trust 
magnate, 
but 
working 
for 
success 
and 
power, 
not 
for 
money. 
There 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
the 
Bolsheviks 
are 
successfully 
solving 
the 
problem 
of 
enlisting 
this 
kind 
of 
ability 
in 
the 
public 
service, 
without 
permitting 
it 
to 
amass 
wealth 
as 
it 
does 
in 
capitalist 
communities. 
This 
is 
perhaps 
their 
greatest 
success 
so 
far, 
outside 
the 
domain 
of 
war. 
It 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
suppose 
that, 
if 
Russia 
is 
allowed 
to 
have 
peace, 
an 
amazing 
industrial 
development 
may 
take 
place, 
making 
Russia 
a 
rival 
of 
the 
United 
States. 
The 
Bolsheviks 
are 
industrialists 
in 
all 
their 
aims; 
they 
love 
everything 
in 
modern 
industry 
except 
the 
excessive 
rewards 
of 
the 
capitalists. 
And 
the 
harsh 
discipline 
to 
which 
they 
are 
subjecting 
the 
workers 
is 
calculated, 
if 
anything 
can, 
to 
give 
them 
the 
habits 
of 
industry 
and 
honesty 
which 
have 
hitherto 
been 
lacking, 
and 
the 
lack 
of 
which 
alone 
prevents 
Russia 
from 
being 
one 
of 
the 
foremost 
industrial 
countries. 


FOOTNOTES: 


[4] 
In 
Theses 
(p. 
6 
of 
French 
edition) 
it 
is 
said: 
"The 
ancient 
classic 
subdivision 
of 
the 
Labour 
movement 
into 
three 
forms 
(parties, 
trade 
unions, 
and 
co-operatives) 
has 
served 
its 
time. 
The 
proletarian 
revolution 
has 
raised 
up 
in 
Russia 
the 
essential 
form 
of 
proletarian 
dictatorship, 
the 
soviets. 
But 
the 
work 
in 
the 
Soviets, 
as 
in 
the 
industrial 
trade 
unions 
which 
have 
become 
revolutionary, 
must 
be 
invariably 
and 
systematically 
directed 
by 
the 
party 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
i.e. 
the 
Communist 
Party. 
As 
the 
organized 
advanced 
guard 
of 
the 
working 
class, 
the 
Communist 
Party 
answers 
equally 
to 
the 
economic, 
political 
and 
spiritual 
needs 
of 
the 
entire 
working 
class. 
It 
must 
be 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
trade 
unions, 
the 
soviets, 
and 
all 
other 
proletarian 

organizations. 


"The 
appearance 
of 
the 
Soviets, 
the 
principal 
historical 
form 
of 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
in 
no 
way 
diminishes 
the 
directing 
rôle 
of 
the 
party 
in 
the 
proletarian 
revolution. 
When 
the 
German 
Communists 
of 
the 
'Left' 
... 
declare 
that 
'the 
party 
itself 
must 
also 
adapt 
itself 
more 
and 
more 
to 
the 
Soviet 
idea 
and 
proletarianize 
itself,' 
we 
see 
there 
only 
an 
insinuating 
expression 
of 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
Communist 
Party 
must 
dissolve 
itself 
into 
the 
Soviets, 
so 
that 
the 
Soviets 
can 
replace 
it. 


"This 
idea 
is 
profoundly 
erroneous 
and 
reactionary. 


"The 
history 
of 
the 
Russian 
Revolution 
shows 
us, 
at 
a 
certain 
moment, 
the 
Soviets 
going 
against 
the 
proletarian 
party 
and 
helping 
the 
agents 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie.... 


"In 
order 
that 
the 
Soviets 
may 
fulfil 
their 
historic 
mission, 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
Communist 
Party, 
strong 
enough 
not 
to 
'adapt' 
itself 
to 
the 
Soviets 
but 
to 
exercise 
on 
them 
a 
decisive 
influence, 
to 
force 
them 
not 
to 
adapt 
themselves 
to 
the 
bourgeoisie 
and 
official 
social 
democracy, 
... 
is 
on 
the 
contrary 
necessary." 


VI 


THE 
FAILURE 
OF 
RUSSIAN 
INDUSTRY 


At 
first 
sight 
it 
is 
surprising 
that 
Russian 
industry 
should 
have 
collapsed 
as 
badly 
as 
it 
has 
done, 
and 
still 
more 
surprising 
that 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Communists 
have 
not 
been 
more 
successful 
in 
reviving 
it. 
As 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
continued 
efficiency 
of 
industry 
is 
the 
main 
condition 
for 
success 
in 
the 
transition 
to 
a 
Communist 
State, 
I 
shall 
endeavour 
to 
analyse 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
collapse, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
the 
discovery 
of 
ways 
by 
which 
it 
can 
be 
avoided 
elsewhere. 


Of 
the 
fact 
of 
the 
collapse 
there 
can 
be 
no 
doubt. 
The 
Ninth 
Congress 
of 
the 
Communist 
Party 
(March-April, 
1920) 
speaks 
of 
"the 
incredible 
catastrophes 
of 
public 
economy," 
and 
in 
connection 
with 
transport, 
which 
is 
one 
of 
the 
vital 
elements 
of 
the 
problem, 
it 
acknowledges 
"the 
terrible 
collapse 
of 
the 
transport 
and 
the 
railway 
system," 
and 
urges 
the 
introduction 
of 
"measures 
which 
cannot 
be 
delayed 
and 
which 
are 
to 
obviate 
the 
complete 
paralysis 
of 
the 
railway 
system 
and, 
together 
with 
this, 
the 
ruin 
of 
the 
Soviet 
Republic." 
Almost 
all 
those 
who 
have 
visited 
Russia 
would 
confirm 
this 
view 
of 
the 
gravity 
of 
the 
situation. 
In 
the 
factories, 
in 
great 
works 
like 
those 
of 
Putilov 
and 
Sornovo, 
very 
little 
except 
war 
work 
is 
being 
done; 
machinery 
stands 
idle 
and 
plant 
is 
becoming 
unusable. 
One 
sees 
hardly 
any 
new 



manufactured 
articles 
in 
Russia, 
beyond 
a 
certain 
very 
inadequate 
quantity 
of 
clothes 
and 
boots--always 
excepting 
what 
is 
needed 
for 
the 
army. 
And 
the 
difficulty 
of 
obtaining 
food 
is 
conclusive 
evidence 
of 
the 
absence 
of 
goods 
such 
as 
are 
needed 
by 
the 
peasants. 


How 
has 
this 
state 
of 
affairs 
arisen? 
And 
why 
does 
it 
continue? 


A 
great 
deal 
of 
disorganization 
occurred 
before 
the 
first 
revolution 
and 
under 
Kerensky. 
Russian 
industry 
was 
partly 
dependent 
on 
Poland; 
the 
war 
was 
conducted 
by 
methods 
of 
reckless 
extravagance, 
especially 
as 
regards 
rolling-stock; 
under 
Kerensky 
there 
was 
a 
tendency 
to 
universal 
holiday, 
under 
the 
impression 
that 
freedom 
had 
removed 
the 
necessity 
for 
work. 
But 
when 
all 
this 
is 
admitted 
to 
the 
full, 
it 
remains 
true 
that 
the 
state 
of 
industry 
under 
the 
Bolsheviks 
is 
much 
worse 
than 
even 
under 
Kerensky. 


The 
first 
and 
most 
obvious 
reason 
for 
this 
is 
that 
Russia 
was 
quite 
unusually 
dependent 
upon 
foreign 
assistance. 
Not 
only 
did 
the 
machinery 
in 
the 
factories 
and 
the 
locomotives 
on 
the 
railways 
come 
from 
abroad, 
but 
the 
organizing 
and 
technical 
brains 
in 
industry 
were 
mainly 
foreign. 
When 
the 
Entente 
became 
hostile 
to 
Russia, 
the 
foreigners 
in 
Russian 
industry 
either 
left 
the 
country 
or 
assisted 
counter-revolution. 
Even 
those 
who 
were 
in 
fact 
loyal 
naturally 
became 
suspect, 
and 
could 
not 
well 
be 
employed 
in 
responsible 
posts, 
any 
more 
than 
Germans 
could 
in 
England 
during 
the 
war. 
The 
native 
Russians 
who 
had 
technical 
or 
business 
skill 
were 
little 
better; 
they 
almost 
all 
practised 
sabotage 
in 
the 
first 
period 
of 
the 
Bolshevik 
régime. 
One 
hears 
amusing 
stories 
of 
common 
sailors 
frantically 
struggling 
with 
complicated 
accounts, 
because 
no 
competent 
accountant 
would 
work 
for 
the 
Bolsheviks. 


But 
those 
days 
passed. 
When 
the 
Government 
was 
seen 
to 
be 
stable, 
a 
great 
many 
of 
those 
who 
had 
formerly 
sabotaged 
it 
became 
willing 
to 
accept 
posts 
under 
it, 
and 
are 
now 
in 
fact 
so 
employed, 
often 
at 
quite 
exceptional 
salaries. 
Their 
importance 
is 
thoroughly 
realized. 
One 
resolution 
at 
the 
above-
mentioned 
Congress 
says 
(I 
quote 
verbally 
the 
unedited 
document 
which 
was 
given 
to 
us 
in 
Moscow): 


Being 
of 
opinion 
that 
without 
a 
scientific 
organization 
of 
industry, 
even 
the 
widest 
application 
of 
compulsory 
labour 
service, 
as 
the 
great 
labour 
heroism 
of 
the 
working 
class, 
will 
not 
only 
fail 
to 
secure 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
powerful 
socialist 
production, 
but 
will 
also 
fail 
to 
assist 
the 
country 
to 
free 
itself 
from 
the 
clutches 
of 
poverty--the 
Congress 
considers 
it 
imperative 
to 
register 
all 
able 
specialists 
of 
the 
various 
departments 
of 
public 
economy 
and 



widely 
to 
utilize 
them 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
industrial 
organization. 


The 
Congress 
considers 
the 
elucidation 
for 
the 
wide 
masses 
of 
the 
workers 
of 
the 
tremendous 
character 
of 
the 
economic 
problems 
of 
the 
country 
to 
be 
one 
of 
the 
chief 
problems 
of 
industrial 
and 
general 
political 
agitation 
and 
propaganda; 
and 
of 
equal 
importance 
to 
this, 
technical 
education, 
and 
administrative 
and 
scientific 
technical 
experience. 
The 
Congress 
makes 
it 
obligatory 
on 
all 
the 
members 
of 
the 
party 
mercilessly 
to 
fight 
that 
particular 
obnoxious 
form, 
the 
ignorant 
conceit 
which 
deems 
the 
working 
class 
capable 
of 
solving 
all 
problems 
without 
the 
assistance 
in 
the 
most 
responsible 
cases 
of 
specialists 
of 
the 
bourgeois 
school, 
the 
management. 
Demagogic 
elements 
who 
speculate 
on 
this 
kind 
of 
prejudice 
in 
the 
more 
backward 
section 
of 
our 
working 
classes, 
can 
have 
no 
place 
in 
the 
ranks 
of 
the 
party 
of 
Scientific 
Socialism. 


But 
Russia 
alone 
is 
unable 
to 
supply 
the 
amount 
of 
skill 
required, 
and 
is 
very 
deficient 
in 
technical 
instructors, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
skilled 
workmen. 
One 
was 
told, 
over 
and 
over 
again, 
that 
the 
first 
step 
in 
improvement 
would 
be 
the 
obtaining 
of 
spare 
parts 
for 
locomotives. 
It 
seems 
strange 
that 
these 
could 
not 
be 
manufactured 
in 
Russia. 
To 
some 
extent 
they 
can 
be, 
and 
we 
were 
shown 
locomotives 
which 
had 
been 
repaired 
on 
Communist 
Saturdays. 
But 
in 
the 
main 
the 
machinery 
for 
making 
spare 
parts 
is 
lacking 
and 
the 
skill 
required 
for 
its 
manufacture 
does 
not 
exist. 
Thus 
dependence 
on 
the 
outside 
world 
persists, 
and 
the 
blockade 
continues 
to 
do 
its 
deadly 
work 
of 
spreading 
hunger, 
demoralization 
and 
despair. 


The 
food 
question 
is 
intimately 
bound 
up 
with 
the 
question 
of 
industry. 
There 
is 
a 
vicious 
circle, 
for 
not 
only 
does 
the 
absence 
of 
manufactured 
goods 
cause 
a 
food 
shortage 
in 
the 
towns, 
but 
the 
food 
shortage, 
in 
turn, 
diminishes 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
workers 
and 
makes 
them 
less 
able 
to 
produce 
goods. 
I 
cannot 
but 
think 
that 
there 
has 
been 
some 
mismanagement 
as 
regards 
the 
food 
question. 
For 
example, 
in 
Petrograd 
many 
workers 
have 
allotments 
and 
often 
work 
in 
them 
for 
eight 
hours 
after 
an 
eight 
hours' 
day 
in 
their 
regular 
employment. 
But 
the 
food 
produced 
in 
the 
allotments 
is 
taken 
for 
general 
consumption, 
not 
left 
to 
each 
individual 
producer. 
This 
is 
in 
accordance 
with 
Communist 
theory, 
but 
of 
course 
greatly 
diminishes 
the 
incentive 
to 
work, 
and 
increases 
the 
red 
tape 
and 
administrative 
machinery. 


Lack 
of 
fuel 
has 
been 
another 
very 
grave 
source 
of 
trouble. 
Before 
the 
war 
coal 
came 
mostly 
from 
Poland 
and 
the 
Donetz 
Basin. 
Poland 
is 
lost 
to 
Russia, 
and 
the 
Donetz 
Basin 
was 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
Denikin, 
who 
so 
destroyed 



the 
mines 
before 
retreating 
that 
they 
are 
still 
not 
in 
working 
order. 
The 
result 
is 
a 
practically 
complete 
absence 
of 
coal. 
Oil, 
which 
is 
equally 
important 
in 
Russia, 
was 
also 
lacking 
until 
the 
recent 
recovery 
of 
Baku. 
All 
that 
I 
saw 
on 
the 
Volga 
made 
me 
believe 
that 
real 
efficiency 
has 
been 
shown 
in 
reorganizing 
the 
transport 
of 
oil, 
and 
doubtless 
this 
will 
do 
something 
to 
revive 
industry. 
But 
the 
oil 
used 
to 
be 
worked 
very 
largely 
by 
Englishmen, 
and 
English 
machinery 
is 
much 
needed 
for 
refining 
it. 
In 
the 
meantime, 
Russia 
has 
had 
to 
depend 
upon 
wood, 
which 
involves 
immense 
labour. 
Most 
of 
the 
houses 
are 
not 
warmed 
in 
winter, 
so 
that 
people 
live 
in 
a 
temperature 
below 
freezing-point. 
Another 
consequence 
of 
lack 
of 
fuel 
was 
the 
bursting 
of 
water-pipes, 
so 
that 
people 
in 
Petrograd, 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
have 
to 
go 
down 
to 
the 
Neva 
to 
fetch 
their 
water--a 
considerable 
addition 
to 
the 
labour 
of 
an 
already 
overworked 
day. 


I 
find 
it 
difficult 
to 
believe 
that, 
if 
greater 
efficiency 
had 
existed 
in 
the 
Government, 
the 
food 
and 
fuel 
difficulties 
could 
not 
have 
been 
considerably 
alleviated. 
In 
spite 
of 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
army, 
there 
are 
still 
many 
horses 
in 
Russia; 
I 
saw 
troops 
of 
thousands 
of 
horses 
on 
the 
Volga, 
which 
apparently 
belonged 
to 
Kalmuk 
tribes. 
By 
the 
help 
of 
carts 
and 
sledges, 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
possible, 
without 
more 
labour 
than 
is 
warranted 
by 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
problem, 
to 
bring 
food 
and 
timber 
into 
Moscow 
and 
Petrograd. 
It 
must 
be 
remembered 
that 
both 
cities 
are 
surrounded 
by 
forests, 
and 
Moscow 
at 
least 
is 
surrounded 
by 
good 
agricultural 
land. 
The 
Government 
has 
devoted 
all 
its 
best 
energies 
hitherto 
to 
the 
two 
tasks 
of 
war 
and 
propaganda, 
while 
industry 
and 
the 
food 
problem 
have 
been 
left 
to 
a 
lesser 
degree 
of 
energy 
and 
intelligence. 
It 
is 
no 
doubt 
probable 
that, 
if 
peace 
is 
secured, 
the 
economic 
problems 
will 
receive 
more 
attention 
than 
hitherto. 
But 
the 
Russian 
character 
seems 
less 
adapted 
to 
steady 
work 
of 
an 
unexciting 
nature 
than 
to 
heroic 
efforts 
on 
great 
occasions; 
it 
has 
immense 
passive 
endurance, 
but 
not 
much 
active 
tenacity. 
Whether, 
with 
the 
menace 
of 
foreign 
invasion 
removed, 
enough 
day-by-day 
detailed 
energy 
would 
exist 
for 
the 
reorganization 
of 
industry, 
is 
a 
doubtful 
question, 
as 
to 
which 
only 
time 
can 
decide. 


This 
leads 
to 
the 
conclusion--which 
I 
think 
is 
adopted 
by 
most 
of 
the 
leading 
men 
in 
Russia--that 
it 
will 
be 
very 
difficult 
indeed 
to 
save 
the 
revolution 
without 
outside 
economic 
assistance. 
Outside 
assistance 
from 
capitalist 
countries 
is 
dangerous 
to 
the 
principles 
of 
Communism, 
as 
well 
as 
precarious 
from 
the 
likelihood 
of 
fresh 
causes 
of 
quarrel. 
But 
the 
need 
of 
help 
is 
urgent, 
and 
if 
the 
policy 
of 
promoting 
revolution 



elsewhere 
were 
to 
succeed, 
it 
would 
probably 
render 
the 
nations 
concerned 
temporarily 
incapable 
of 
supplying 
Russian 
needs. 
It 
is, 
therefore, 
necessary 
for 
Russia 
to 
accept 
the 
risks 
and 
uncertainties 
involved 
in 
attempting 
to 
make 
peace 
with 
the 
Entente 
and 
to 
trade 
with 
America. 
By 
continuing 
war, 
Russia 
can 
do 
infinite 
damage 
to 
us, 
especially 
in 
Asia, 
but 
cannot 
hope, 
for 
many 
years, 
to 
achieve 
any 
degree 
of 
internal 
prosperity. 
The 
situation, 
therefore, 
is 
one 
in 
which, 
even 
from 
the 
narrowest 
point 
of 
view, 
peace 
is 
to 
the 
interest 
of 
both 
parties. 


It 
is 
difficult 
for 
an 
outsider 
with 
only 
superficial 
knowledge 
to 
judge 
of 
the 
efforts 
which 
have 
been 
made 
to 
reorganize 
industry 
without 
outside 
help. 
These 
efforts 
have 
chiefly 
taken 
the 
form 
of 
industrial 
conscription. 
Workers 
in 
towns 
seek 
to 
escape 
to 
the 
country, 
in 
order 
to 
have 
enough 
to 
eat; 
but 
this 
is 
illegal 
and 
severely 
punished. 
The 
same 
Communist 
Report 
from 
which 
I 
have 
already 
quoted 
speaks 
on 
this 
subject 
as 
follows: 


Labour 
Desertion.--Owing 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
considerable 
part 
of 
the 
workers 
either 
in 
search 
of 
better 
food 
conditions 
or 
often 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
speculation, 
voluntarily 
leave 
their 
places 
of 
employment 
or 
change 
from 
place 
to 
place, 
which 
inevitably 
harms 
production 
and 
deteriorates 
the 
general 
position 
of 
the 
working 
class, 
the 
Congress 
considers 
one 
of 
the 
most 
urgent 
problems 
of 
Soviet 
Government 
and 
of 
the 
Trade 
Union 
organization 
to 
be 
established 
as 
the 
firm, 
systematic 
and 
insistent 
struggle 
with 
labour 
desertion, 
The 
way 
to 
fight 
this 
is 
to 
publish 
a 
list 
of 
desertion 
fines, 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
labour 
Detachment 
of 
Deserters 
under 
fine, 
and, 
finally, 
internment 
in 
concentration 
camps. 


It 
is 
hoped 
to 
extend 
the 
system 
to 
the 
peasantry: 


The 
defeat 
of 
the 
White 
Armies 
and 
the 
problems 
of 
peaceful 
construction 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
incredible 
catastrophes 
of 
public 
economy 
demand 
an 
extraordinary 
effort 
of 
all 
the 
powers 
of 
the 
proletariat 
and 
the 
drafting 
into 
the 
process 
of 
public 
labour 
of 
the 
wide 
masses 
of 
the 
peasantry. 


On 
the 
vital 
subject 
of 
transport, 
in 
a 
passage 
of 
which 
I 
have 
already 
quoted 
a 
fragment, 
the 
Communist 
Party 
declares: 


For 
the 
most 
immediate 
future 
transport 
remains 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
attention 
and 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Soviet 
Government. 
The 
improvement 
of 
transport 
is 
the 
indispensable 
basis 
upon 
which 
even 
the 
most 
moderate 
success 
in 
all 
other 
spheres 
of 
production 
and 
first 
of 
all 
in 
the 
provision 
question 
can 
be 
gained. 



The 
chief 
difficulty 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
improvement 
of 
transport 
is 
the 
weakness 
of 
the 
Transport 
Trade 
Union, 
which 
is 
due 
in 
the 
first 
case 
to 
the 
heterogeneity 
of 
the 
personnel 
of 
the 
railways, 
amongst 
whom 
there 
are 
still 
a 
number 
of 
those 
who 
belong 
to 
the 
period 
of 
disorganization, 
and, 
secondly, 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
most 
class-conscious 
and 
best 
elements 
of 
the 
railway 
proletariat 
were 
at 
the 
various 
fronts 
of 
the 
civil 
war. 


Considering 
wide 
Trade 
Union 
assistance 
to 
the 
railway 
workers 
to 
be 
one 
of 
the 
principal 
tasks 
of 
the 
Party, 
and 
as 
the 
only 
condition 
under 
which 
transport 
can 
be 
raised 
to 
its 
height, 
the 
Congress 
at 
the 
same 
time 
recognizes 
the 
inflexible 
necessity 
of 
employing 
exclusive 
and 
extraordinary 
measures 
(martial 
law, 
and 
so 
forth). 
Such 
necessity 
is 
the 
result 
of 
the 
terrible 
collapse 
of 
the 
transport 
and 
the 
railroad 
system 
and 
is 
to 
introduce 
measures 
which 
cannot 
be 
delayed 
and 
which 
are 
to 
obviate 
the 
complete 
paralysis 
of 
the 
railway 
system 
and, 
together 
with 
this, 
the 
ruin 
of 
the 
Soviet 
Republic. 


The 
general 
attitude 
to 
the 
militarization 
of 
labour 
is 
stated 
in 
the 
Resolution 
with 
which 
this 
section 
of 
the 
Proceedings 
begins: 


The 
ninth 
Congress 
approves 
of 
the 
decision 
of 
the 
Central 
Committee 
of 
the 
Russian 
Communist 
Party 
on 
the 
mobilization 
of 
the 
industrial 
proletariat, 
compulsory 
labour 
service, 
militarization 
of 
production 
and 
the 
application 
of 
military 
detachments 
to 
economic 
needs. 


In 
connection 
with 
the 
above, 
the 
Congress 
decrees 
that 
the 
Party 
organization 
should 
in 
every 
way 
assist 
the 
Trade 
Unions 
and 
the 
Labour 
Sections 
in 
registering 
all 
skilled 
workers 
with 
a 
view 
of 
employing 
them 
in 
the 
various 
branches 
of 
production 
with 
the 
same 
consistency 
and 
strictness 
as 
was 
done, 
and 
is 
being 
carried 
out 
at 
the 
present 
time, 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
commanding 
staff 
for 
army 
needs. 


Every 
skilled 
worker 
is 
to 
return 
to 
his 
particular 
trade 
Exceptions, 
i.e. 
the 
retention 
of 
the 
skilled 
worker 
in 
any 
other 
branch 
of 
Soviet 
service, 
is 
allowed 
only 
with 
the 
sanction 
of 
the 
corresponding 
central 
and 
local 
authorities. 


It 
is, 
of 
course, 
evident 
that 
in 
these 
measures 
the 
Bolsheviks 
have 
been 
compelled 
to 
travel 
a 
long 
way 
from 
the 
ideals 
which 
originally 
inspired 
the 
revolution. 
But 
the 
situation 
is 
so 
desperate 
that 
they 
could 
not 
be 
blamed 
if 
their 
measures 
were 
successful. 
In 
a 
shipwreck 
all 
hands 
must 
turn 
to, 
and 
it 
would 
be 
ridiculous 
to 
prate 
of 
individual 
liberty. 
The 
most 
distressing 
feature 
of 
the 
situation 
is 
that 
these 
stern 
laws 
seem 
to 
have 
produced 
so 
little 
effect. 
Perhaps 
in 
the 
course 
of 
years 
Russia 
might 
become 
self-supporting 



without 
help 
from 
the 
outside 
world, 
but 
the 
suffering 
meantime 
would 
be 
terrible. 
The 
early 
hopes 
of 
the 
revolution 
would 
fade 
more 
and 
more. 
Every 
failure 
of 
industry, 
every 
tyrannous 
regulation 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
desperate 
situation, 
is 
used 
by 
the 
Entente 
as 
a 
justification 
of 
its 
policy. 
If 
a 
man 
is 
deprived 
of 
food 
and 
drink, 
he 
will 
grow 
weak, 
lose 
his 
reason, 
and 
finally 
die. 
This 
is 
not 
usually 
considered 
a 
good 
reason 
for 
inflicting 
death 
by 
starvation. 
But 
where 
nations 
are 
concerned, 
the 
weakness 
and 
struggles 
are 
regarded 
as 
morally 
culpable, 
and 
are 
held 
to 
justify 
further 
punishment. 
So 
at 
least 
it 
has 
been 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Russia. 
Nothing 
produced 
a 
doubt 
in 
our 
governing 
minds 
as 
to 
the 
rightness 
of 
our 
policy 
except 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
Red 
Army 
and 
the 
fear 
of 
revolution 
in 
Asia. 
Is 
it 
surprising 
that 
professions 
of 
humanitarian 
feeling 
on 
the 
part 
of 
English 
people 
are 
somewhat 
coldly 
received 
in 
Soviet 
Russia? 


VII 


DAILY 
LIFE 
IN 
MOSCOW 


Daily 
life 
in 
Moscow, 
so 
far 
as 
I 
could 
discover, 
has 
neither 
the 
horrors 
depicted 
by 
the 
Northcliffe 
Press 
nor 
the 
delights 
imagined 
by 
the 
more 
ardent 
of 
our 
younger 
Socialists. 


On 
the 
one 
hand, 
there 
is 
no 
disorder, 
very 
little 
crime, 
not 
much 
insecurity 
for 
those 
who 
keep 
clear 
of 
politics. 
Everybody 
works 
hard; 
the 
educated 
people 
have, 
by 
this 
time, 
mostly 
found 
their 
way 
into 
Government 
offices 
or 
teaching 
or 
some 
other 
administrative 
profession 
in 
which 
their 
education 
is 
useful. 
The 
theatres, 
the 
opera 
and 
the 
ballet 
continue 
as 
before, 
and 
are 
quite 
admirable; 
some 
of 
the 
seats 
are 
paid 
for, 
others 
are 
given 
free 
to 
members 
of 
trade 
unions. 
There 
is, 
of 
course, 
no 
drunkenness, 
or 
at 
any 
rate 
so 
little 
that 
none 
of 
us 
ever 
saw 
a 
sign 
of 
it. 
There 
is 
very 
little 
prostitution, 
infinitely 
less 
than 
in 
any 
other 
capital. 
Women 
are 
safer 
from 
molestation 
than 
anywhere 
else 
in 
the 
world. 
The 
whole 
impression 
is 
one 
of 
virtuous, 
well-ordered 
activity. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
life 
is 
very 
hard 
for 
all 
except 
men 
in 
good 
posts. 
It 
is 
hard, 
first 
of 
all, 
owing 
to 
the 
food 
shortage. 
This 
is 
familiar 
to 
all 
who 
have 
interested 
themselves 
in 
Russia, 
and 
it 
is 
unnecessary 
to 
dwell 
upon 
it. 
What 
is 
less 
realized 
is 
that 
most 
people 
work 
much 
longer 
hours 
than 
in 
this 
country. 
The 
eight-hour 
day 
was 
introduced 
with 
a 
flourish 
of 
trumpets; 
then, 
owing 
to 
the 
pressure 
of 
the 
war, 
it 
was 
extended 
to 
ten 
hours 
in 
certain 
trades. 
But 
no 
provision 
exists 
against 
extra 
work 
at 
other 
jobs, 
and 
very 
many 
people 
do 
extra 
work, 
because 
the 
official 
rates 
do 
not 
afford 
a 
living 



wage. 
This 
is 
not 
the 
fault 
of 
the 
Government, 
at 
any 
rate 
as 
regards 
the 
major 
part; 
it 
is 
due 
chiefly 
to 
war 
and 
blockade. 
When 
the 
day's 
work 
is 
over, 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
time 
has 
to 
be 
spent 
in 
fetching 
food 
and 
water 
and 
other 
necessaries 
of 
life. 
The 
sight 
of 
the 
workers 
going 
to 
and 
fro, 
shabbily 
clad, 
with 
the 
inevitable 
bundle 
in 
one 
hand 
and 
tin 
can 
in 
the 
other, 
through 
streets 
almost 
entirely 
empty 
of 
traffic, 
produces 
the 
effect 
of 
life 
in 
some 
vast 
village, 
rather 
than 
in 
an 
important 
capital 
city. 


Holidays, 
such 
as 
are 
common 
throughout 
all 
but 
the 
very 
poorest 
class 
in 
this 
country, 
are 
very 
difficult 
in 
Russia. 
A 
train 
journey 
requires 
a 
permit, 
which 
is 
only 
granted 
on 
good 
reasons 
being 
shown; 
with 
the 
present 
shortage 
of 
transport, 
this 
regulation 
is 
quite 
unavoidable. 
Railway 
queues 
are 
a 
common 
feature 
in 
Moscow; 
it 
often 
takes 
several 
days 
to 
get 
a 
permit. 
Then, 
when 
it 
has 
been 
obtained, 
it 
may 
take 
several 
more 
days 
to 
get 
a 
seat 
in 
a 
train. 
The 
ordinary 
trains 
are 
inconceivably 
crowded, 
far 
more 
so, 
though 
that 
seems 
impossible, 
than 
London 
trains 
at 
the 
busiest 
hour. 
On 
the 
shorter 
journeys, 
passengers 
are 
even 
known 
to 
ride 
on 
the 
roof 
and 
buffers, 
or 
cling 
like 
flies 
to 
the 
sides 
of 
the 
waggons. 
People 
in 
Moscow 
travel 
to 
the 
country 
whenever 
they 
can 
afford 
the 
time 
and 
get 
a 
permit, 
because 
in 
the 
country 
there 
is 
enough 
to 
eat. 
They 
go 
to 
stay 
with 
relations--most 
people 
in 
Moscow, 
in 
all 
classes, 
but 
especially 
among 
manual 
workers, 
have 
relations 
in 
the 
country. 
One 
cannot, 
of 
course, 
go 
to 
an 
hotel 
as 
one 
would 
in 
other 
countries. 
Hotels 
have 
been 
taken 
over 
by 
the 
State, 
and 
the 
rooms 
in 
them 
(when 
they 
are 
still 
used) 
are 
allocated 
by 
the 
police 
to 
people 
whose 
business 
is 
recognized 
as 
important 
by 
the 
authorities. 
Casual 
travel 
is 
therefore 
impossible 
even 
on 
a 
holiday. 


Journeys 
have 
vexations 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
slowness 
and 
overcrowding 
of 
the 
trains. 
Police 
search 
the 
travellers 
for 
evidences 
of 
"speculation," 
especially 
for 
food. 
The 
police 
play, 
altogether, 
a 
much 
greater 
part 
in 
daily 
life 
than 
they 
do 
in 
other 
countries--much 
greater 
than 
they 
did, 
for 
example, 
in 
Prussia 
twenty-five 
years 
ago, 
when 
there 
was 
a 
vigorous 
campaign 
against 
Socialism. 
Everybody 
breaks 
the 
law 
almost 
daily, 
and 
no 
one 
knows 
which 
among 
his 
acquaintances 
is 
a 
spy 
of 
the 
Extraordinary 
Commission. 
Even 
in 
the 
prisons, 
among 
prisoners, 
there 
are 
spies, 
who 
are 
allowed 
certain 
privileges 
but 
not 
their 
liberty. 


Newspapers 
are 
not 
taken 
in, 
except 
by 
very 
few 
people, 
but 
they 
are 
stuck 
up 
in 
public 
places, 
where 
passers-by 
occasionally 
glance 
at 
them.[5] 
There 
is 
very 
little 
to 
read; 
owing 
to 
paper 
shortage, 
books 
are 
rare, 
and 



money 
to 
buy 
them 
is 
still 
rarer. 
One 
does 
not 
see 
people 
reading, 
as 
one 
does 
here 
in 
the 
Underground 
for 
example. 
There 
is 
practically 
no 
social 
life, 
partly 
because 
of 
the 
food 
shortage, 
partly 
because, 
when 
anybody 
is 
arrested, 
the 
police 
are 
apt 
to 
arrest 
everybody 
whom 
they 
find 
in 
his 
company, 
or 
who 
comes 
to 
visit 
him. 
And 
once 
arrested, 
a 
man 
or 
woman, 
however 
innocent, 
may 
remain 
for 
months 
in 
prison 
without 
trial. 
While 
we 
were 
in 
Moscow, 
forty 
social 
revolutionaries 
and 
Anarchists 
were 
hunger-striking 
to 
enforce 
their 
demand 
to 
be 
tried 
and 
to 
be 
allowed 
visits. 
I 
was 
told 
that 
on 
the 
eighth 
day 
of 
the 
strike 
the 
Government 
consented 
to 
try 
them, 
and 
that 
few 
could 
be 
proved 
guilty 
of 
any 
crime; 
but 
I 
had 
no 
means 
of 
verifying 
this. 


Industrial 
conscription 
is, 
of 
course, 
rigidly 
enforced. 
Every 
man 
and 
woman 
has 
to 
work, 
and 
slacking 
is 
severely 
punished, 
by 
prison 
or 
a 
penal 
settlement. 
Strikes 
are 
illegal, 
though 
they 
sometimes 
occur. 
By 
proclaiming 
itself 
the 
friend 
of 
the 
proletarian, 
the 
Government 
has 
been 
enabled 
to 
establish 
an 
iron 
discipline, 
beyond 
the 
wildest 
dreams 
of 
the 
most 
autocratic 
American 
magnate. 
And 
by 
the 
same 
professions 
the 
Government 
has 
led 
Socialists 
from 
other 
countries 
to 
abstain 
from 
reporting 
unpleasant 
features 
in 
what 
they 
have 
seen. 


The 
Tolstoyans, 
of 
whom 
I 
saw 
the 
leaders, 
are 
obliged 
by 
their 
creed 
to 
resist 
every 
form 
of 
conscription, 
though 
some 
have 
found 
ways 
of 
compromising. 
The 
law 
concerning 
conscientious 
objectors 
to 
military 
service 
is 
practically 
the 
same 
as 
ours, 
and 
its 
working 
depends 
upon 
the 
temper 
of 
the 
tribunal 
before 
which 
a 
man 
comes. 
Some 
conscientious 
objectors 
have 
been 
shot; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
some 
have 
obtained 
absolute 
exemption. 


Life 
in 
Moscow, 
as 
compared 
to 
life 
in 
London, 
is 
drab, 
monotonous, 
and 
depressed. 
I 
am 
not, 
of 
course, 
comparing 
life 
there 
with 
that 
of 
the 
rich 
here, 
but 
with 
that 
of 
the 
average 
working-class 
family. 
When 
it 
is 
realized 
that 
the 
highest 
wages 
are 
about 
fifteen 
shillings 
a 
month, 
this 
is 
not 
surprising. 
I 
do 
not 
think 
that 
life 
could, 
under 
any 
system, 
be 
very 
cheerful 
in 
a 
country 
so 
exhausted 
by 
war 
as 
Russia, 
so 
I 
am 
not 
saying 
this 
as 
a 
criticism 
of 
the 
Bolsheviks. 
But 
I 
do 
think 
there 
might 
be 
less 
police 
interference, 
less 
vexatious 
regulation, 
and 
more 
freedom 
for 
spontaneous 
impulses 
towards 
harmless 
enjoyments. 


Religion 
is 
still 
very 
strong. 
I 
went 
into 
many 
churches, 
where 
I 
saw 
obviously 
famished 
priests 
in 
gorgeous 
vestments, 
and 
a 
congregation 



enormously 
devout. 
Generally 
more 
than 
half 
the 
congregation 
were 
men, 
and 
among 
the 
men 
many 
were 
soldiers. 
This 
applies 
to 
the 
towns 
as 
well 
as 
to 
the 
country. 
In 
Moscow 
I 
constantly 
saw 
people 
in 
the 
streets 
crossing 
themselves. 


There 
is 
a 
theory 
that 
the 
Moscow 
working 
man 
feels 
himself 
free 
from 
capitalist 
domination, 
and 
therefore 
bears 
hardships 
gladly. 
This 
is 
no 
doubt 
true 
of 
the 
minority 
who 
are 
active 
Communists, 
but 
I 
do 
not 
think 
it 
has 
any 
truth 
for 
the 
others. 
The 
average 
working 
man, 
to 
judge 
by 
a 
rather 
hasty 
impression, 
feels 
himself 
the 
slave 
of 
the 
Government, 
and 
has 
no 
sense 
whatever 
of 
having 
been 
liberated 
from 
a 
tyranny. 


I 
recognize 
to 
the 
full 
the 
reasons 
for 
the 
bad 
state 
of 
affairs, 
in 
the 
past 
history 
of 
Russia 
and 
the 
recent 
policy 
of 
the 
Entente. 
But 
I 
have 
thought 
it 
better 
to 
record 
impressions 
frankly, 
trusting 
the 
readers 
to 
remember 
that 
the 
Bolsheviks 
have 
only 
a 
very 
limited 
share 
of 
responsibility 
for 
the 
evils 
from 
which 
Russia 
is 
suffering. 


FOOTNOTES:

The 
ninth 
Communist 
Congress 
(March-April, 
1920) 
says 
on 
this 
subject: 
"In 
view 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
first 
condition 
of 
the 
success 
of 
the 
Soviet 
Republic 
in 
all 
departments, 
including 
the 
economic, 
is 
chiefly 
systematic 
printed 
agitation, 
the 
Congress 
draws 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
Soviet 
Government 
to 
the 
deplorable 
state 
in 
which 
our 
paper 
and 
printing 
industries 
find 
themselves. 
The 
ever 
decreasing 
number 
of 
newspapers 
fail 
to 
reach 
not 
only 
the 
peasants 
but 
even 
the 
workers, 
in 
addition 
to 
which 
our 
poor 
technical 
means 
render 
the 
papers 
hardly 
readable. 
The 
Congress 
strongly 
appeals 
to 
the 
Supreme 
Council 
of 
Public 
Economy, 
to 
the 
corresponding 
Trade 
Unions 
and 
other 
interested 
institutions, 
to 
apply 
all 
efforts 
to 
raise 
the 
quantity, 
to 
introduce 
general 
system 
and 
order 
in 
the 
printing 
business, 
and 
so 
secure 
for 
the 
worker 
and 
peasant 
in 
Russia 
a 
supply 
of 
Socialist 
printed 
matter." 
VIII 


TOWN 
AND 
COUNTRY 


The 
problem 
of 
inducing 
the 
peasants 
to 
feed 
the 
towns 
is 
one 
which 
Russia 
shares 
with 
Central 
Europe, 
and 
from 
what 
one 
hears 
Russia 
has 
been 
less 
unsuccessful 
than 
some 
other 
countries 
in 
dealing 
with 
this 
problem. 
For 
the 
Soviet 
Government, 
the 
problem 
is 
mainly 
concentrated 
in 
Moscow 
and 
Petrograd; 
the 
other 
towns 
are 
not 
very 
large, 
and 
are 
mostly 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
rich 
agricultural 
districts. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
in 
the 
North 
even 
the 
rural 
population 



normally 
depends 
upon 
food 
from 
more 
southerly 
districts; 
but 
the 
northern 
population 
is 
small. 
It 
is 
commonly 
said 
that 
the 
problem 
of 
feeding 
Moscow 
and 
Petrograd 
is 
a 
transport 
problem, 
but 
I 
think 
this 
is 
only 
partially 
true. 
There 
is, 
of 
course, 
a 
grave 
deficiency 
of 
rolling-stock, 
especially 
of 
locomotives 
in 
good 
repair. 
But 
Moscow 
is 
surrounded 
by 
very 
good 
land. 
In 
the 
course 
of 
a 
day's 
motoring 
in 
the 
neighbourhood, 
I 
saw 
enough 
cows 
to 
supply 
milk 
to 
the 
whole 
child 
population 
of 
Moscow, 
although 
what 
I 
had 
come 
to 
see 
was 
children's 
sanatoria, 
not 
farms. 
All 
kinds 
of 
food 
can 
be 
bought 
in 
the 
market 
at 
high 
prices. 
I 
travelled 
over 
a 
considerable 
extent 
of 
Russian 
railways, 
and 
saw 
a 
fair 
number 
of 
goods 
trains. 
For 
all 
these 
reasons, 
I 
feel 
convinced 
that 
the 
share 
of 
the 
transport 
problem 
in 
the 
food 
difficulties 
has 
been 
exaggerated. 
Of 
course 
transport 
plays 
a 
larger 
part 
in 
the 
shortage 
in 
Petrograd 
than 
in 
Moscow, 
because 
food 
comes 
mainly 
from 
south 
of 
Moscow. 
In 
Petrograd, 
most 
of 
the 
people 
one 
sees 
in 
the 
streets 
show 
obvious 
signs 
of 
under-feeding. 
In 
Moscow, 
the 
visible 
signs 
are 
much 
less 
frequent, 
but 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
under-feeding, 
though 
not 
actual 
starvation, 
is 
nearly 
universal. 


The 
Government 
supplies 
rations 
to 
every 
one 
who 
works 
in 
the 
towns 
at 
a 
very 
low 
fixed 
price. 
The 
official 
theory 
is 
that 
the 
Government 
has 
a 
monopoly 
of 
the 
food 
and 
that 
the 
rations 
are 
sufficient 
to 
sustain 
life. 
The 
fact 
is 
that 
the 
rations 
are 
not 
sufficient, 
and 
that 
they 
are 
only 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
food 
supply 
of 
Moscow. 
Moreover, 
people 
complain, 
I 
do 
not 
know 
how 
truly, 
that 
the 
rations 
are 
delivered 
irregularly; 
some 
say, 
about 
every 
other 
day. 
Under 
these 
circumstances, 
almost 
everybody, 
rich 
or 
poor, 
buys 
food 
in 
the 
market, 
where 
it 
costs 
about 
fifty 
times 
the 
fixed 
Government 
price. 
A 
pound 
of 
butter 
costs 
about 
a 
month's 
wages. 
In 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
afford 
extra 
food, 
people 
adopt 
various 
expedients. 
Some 
do 
additional 
work, 
at 
extra 
rates, 
after 
their 
official 
day's 
work 
is 
over. 
For, 
though 
there 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
by 
law 
an 
eight-hours 
day, 
extended 
to 
ten 
in 
certain 
vital 
industries, 
the 
wage 
paid 
for 
it 
is 
not 
a 
living 
wage, 
and 
there 
is 
nothing 
to 
prevent 
a 
man 
from 
undertaking 
other 
work 
in 
his 
spare 
time. 
But 
the 
usual 
resource 
is 
what 
is 
called 
"speculation," 
i.e., 
buying 
and 
selling. 
Some 
person 
formerly 
rich 
sells 
clothes 
or 
furniture 
or 
jewellery 
in 
return 
for 
food; 
the 
buyer 
sells 
again 
at 
an 
enhanced 
price, 
and 
so 
on 
through 
perhaps 
twenty 
hands, 
until 
a 
final 
purchaser 
is 
found 
in 
some 
well-to-do 
peasant 
or 
nouveau 
riche 
speculator. 
Again, 
most 
people 
have 
relations 
in 
the 
country, 
whom 
they 
visit 
from 
time 
to 
time, 
bringing 
back 
with 
them 
great 
bags 
of 
flour. 
It 
is 



illegal 
for 
private 
persons 
to 
bring 
food 
into 
Moscow, 
and 
the 
trains 
are 
searched; 
but, 
by 
corruption 
or 
cunning, 
experienced 
people 
can 
elude 
the 
search. 
The 
food 
market 
is 
illegal, 
and 
is 
raided 
occasionally; 
but 
as 
a 
rule 
it 
is 
winked 
at. 
Thus 
the 
attempt 
to 
suppress 
private 
commerce 
has 
resulted 
in 
an 
amount 
of 
unprofessional 
buying 
and 
selling 
which 
far 
exceeds 
what 
happens 
in 
capitalist 
countries. 
It 
takes 
up 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
time 
that 
might 
be 
more 
profitably 
employed; 
and, 
being 
illegal, 
it 
places 
practically 
the 
whole 
population 
of 
Moscow 
at 
the 
mercy 
of 
the 
police. 
Moreover, 
it 
depends 
largely 
upon 
the 
stores 
of 
goods 
belonging 
to 
those 
who 
were 
formerly 
rich, 
and 
when 
these 
are 
expended 
the 
whole 
system 
must 
collapse, 
unless 
industry 
has 
meanwhile 
been 
re-established 
on 
a 
sound 
basis. 


It 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
state 
of 
affairs 
is 
unsatisfactory, 
but, 
from 
the 
Government's 
point 
of 
view, 
it 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
see 
what 
ought 
to 
be 
done. 
The 
urban 
and 
industrial 
population 
is 
mainly 
concerned 
in 
carrying 
on 
the 
work 
of 
government 
and 
supplying 
munitions 
to 
the 
army. 
These 
are 
very 
necessary 
tasks, 
the 
cost 
of 
which 
ought 
to 
be 
defrayed 
out 
of 
taxation. 
A 
moderate 
tax 
in 
kind 
on 
the 
peasants 
would 
easily 
feed 
Moscow 
and 
Petrograd. 
But 
the 
peasants 
take 
no 
interest 
in 
war 
or 
government. 
Russia 
is 
so 
vast 
that 
invasion 
of 
one 
part 
does 
not 
touch 
another 
part; 
and 
the 
peasants 
are 
too 
ignorant 
to 
have 
any 
national 
consciousness, 
such 
as 
one 
takes 
for 
granted 
in 
England 
or 
France 
or 
Germany. 
The 
peasants 
will 
not 
willingly 
part 
with 
a 
portion 
of 
their 
produce 
merely 
for 
purposes 
of 
national 
defence, 
but 
only 
for 
the 
goods 
they 
need--clothes, 
agricultural 
implements, 
&c.-which 
the 
Government, 
owing 
to 
the 
war 
and 
the 
blockade, 
is 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
supply. 


When 
the 
food 
shortage 
was 
at 
its 
worst, 
the 
Government 
antagonized 
the 
peasants 
by 
forced 
requisitions, 
carried 
out 
with 
great 
harshness 
by 
the 
Red 
Army. 
This 
method 
has 
been 
modified, 
but 
the 
peasants 
still 
part 
unwillingly 
with 
their 
food, 
as 
is 
natural 
in 
view 
of 
the 
uselessness 
of 
paper 
and 
the 
enormously 
higher 
prices 
offered 
by 
private 
buyers. 


The 
food 
problem 
is 
the 
main 
cause 
of 
popular 
opposition 
to 
the 
Bolsheviks, 
yet 
I 
cannot 
see 
how 
any 
popular 
policy 
could 
have 
been 
adopted. 
The 
Bolsheviks 
are 
disliked 
by 
the 
peasants 
because 
they 
take 
so 
much 
food; 
they 
are 
disliked 
in 
the 
towns 
because 
they 
take 
so 
little. 
What 
the 
peasants 
want 
is 
what 
is 
called 
free 
trade, 
i.e., 
de-control 
of 
agricultural 
produce. 
If 
this 
policy 
were 
adopted, 
the 
towns 
would 
be 
faced 
by 
utter 



starvation, 
not 
merely 
by 
hunger 
and 
hardship. 
It 
is 
an 
entire 
misconception 
to 
suppose 
that 
the 
peasants 
cherish 
any 
hostility 
to 
the 
Entente. 
The 
Daily 
News 
of 
July 
13th, 
in 
an 
otherwise 
excellent 
leading 
article, 
speaks 
of 
"the 
growing 
hatred 
of 
the 
Russian 
peasant, 
who 
is 
neither 
a 
Communist 
nor 
a 
Bolshevik, 
for 
the 
Allies 
generally 
and 
this 
country 
in 
particular." 
The 
typical 
Russian 
peasant 
has 
never 
heard 
of 
the 
Allies 
or 
of 
this 
country; 
he 
does 
not 
know 
that 
there 
is 
a 
blockade; 
all 
he 
knows 
is 
that 
he 
used 
to 
have 
six 
cows 
but 
the 
Government 
reduced 
him 
to 
one 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
poorer 
peasants, 
and 
that 
it 
takes 
his 
corn 
(except 
what 
is 
needed 
for 
his 
own 
family) 
at 
a 
very 
low 
price. 
The 
reasons 
for 
these 
actions 
do 
not 
interest 
him, 
since 
his 
horizon 
is 
bounded 
by 
his 
own 
village. 
To 
a 
remarkable 
extent, 
each 
village 
is 
an 
independent 
unit. 
So 
long 
as 
the 
Government 
obtains 
the 
food 
and 
soldiers 
that 
it 
requires, 
it 
does 
not 
interfere, 
and 
leaves 
untouched 
the 
old 
village 
communism, 
which 
is 
extraordinarily 
unlike 
Bolshevism 
and 
entirely 
dependent 
upon 
a 
very 
primitive 
stage 
of 
culture. 


The 
Government 
represents 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
urban 
and 
industrial 
population, 
and 
is, 
as 
it 
were, 
encamped 
amid 
a 
peasant 
nation, 
with 
whom 
its 
relations 
are 
rather 
diplomatic 
and 
military 
than 
governmental 
in 
the 
ordinary 
sense. 
The 
economic 
situation, 
as 
in 
Central 
Europe, 
is 
favourable 
to 
the 
country 
and 
unfavourable 
to 
the 
towns. 
If 
Russia 
were 
governed 
democratically, 
according 
to 
the 
will 
of 
the 
majority, 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
Moscow 
and 
Petrograd 
would 
die 
of 
starvation. 
As 
it 
is, 
Moscow 
and 
Petrograd 
just 
manage 
to 
live, 
by 
having 
the 
whole 
civil 
and 
military 
power 
of 
the 
State 
devoted 
to 
their 
needs. 
Russia 
affords 
the 
curious 
spectacle 
of 
a 
vast 
and 
powerful 
Empire, 
prosperous 
at 
the 
periphery, 
but 
faced 
with 
dire 
want 
at 
the 
centre. 
Those 
who 
have 
least 
prosperity 
have 
most 
power; 
and 
it 
is 
only 
through 
their 
excess 
of 
power 
that 
they 
are 
enabled 
to 
live 
at 
all. 
The 
situation 
is 
due 
at 
bottom 
to 
two 
facts: 
that 
almost 
the 
whole 
industrial 
energies 
of 
the 
population 
have 
had 
to 
be 
devoted 
to 
war, 
and 
that 
the 
peasants 
do 
not 
appreciate 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
war 
or 
the 
fact 
of 
the 
blockade. 


It 
is 
futile 
to 
blame 
the 
Bolsheviks 
for 
an 
unpleasant 
and 
difficult 
situation 
which 
it 
has 
been 
impossible 
for 
them 
to 
avoid. 
Their 
problem 
is 
only 
soluble 
in 
one 
of 
two 
ways: 
by 
the 
cessation 
of 
the 
war 
and 
the 
blockade, 
which 
would 
enable 
them 
to 
supply 
the 
peasants 
with 
the 
goods 
they 
need 
in 
exchange 
for 
food; 
or 
by 
the 
gradual 
development 
of 
an 
independent 
Russian 
industry. 
This 
latter 
method 
would 
be 
slow, 
and 
would 



involve 
terrible 
hardships, 
but 
some 
of 
the 
ablest 
men 
in 
the 
Government 
believe 
it 
to 
be 
possible 
if 
peace 
cannot 
be 
achieved. 
If 
we 
force 
this 
method 
upon 
Russia 
by 
the 
refusal 
of 
peace 
and 
trade, 
we 
shall 
forfeit 
the 
only 
inducement 
we 
can 
hold 
out 
for 
friendly 
relations; 
we 
shall 
render 
the 
Soviet 
State 
unassailable 
and 
completely 
free 
to 
pursue 
the 
policy 
of 
promoting 
revolution 
everywhere. 
But 
the 
industrial 
problem 
is 
a 
large 
subject, 
which 
has 
been 
already 
discussed 
in 
Chapter 
VI. 


IX 


INTERNATIONAL 
POLICY 


In 
the 
course 
of 
these 
chapters, 
I 
have 
had 
occasion 
to 
mention 
disagreeable 
features 
of 
the 
Bolshevik 
régime. 
But 
it 
must 
always 
be 
remembered 
that 
these 
are 
chiefly 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
industrial 
life 
of 
Russia 
has 
been 
paralysed 
except 
as 
ministering 
to 
the 
wants 
of 
the 
Army, 
and 
that 
the 
Government 
has 
had 
to 
wage 
a 
bitter 
and 
doubtful 
civil 
and 
external 
war, 
involving 
the 
constant 
menace 
of 
domestic 
enemies. 
Harshness, 
espionage, 
and 
a 
curtailment 
of 
liberty 
result 
unavoidably 
from 
these 
difficulties. 
I 
have 
no 
doubt 
whatever 
that 
the 
sole 
cure 
for 
the 
evils 
from 
which 
Russia 
is 
suffering 
is 
peace 
and 
trade. 
Peace 
and 
trade 
would 
put 
an 
end 
to 
the 
hostility 
of 
the 
peasants, 
and 
would 
at 
once 
enable 
the 
Government 
to 
depend 
upon 
popularity 
rather 
than 
force. 
The 
character 
of 
the 
Government 
would 
alter 
rapidly 
under 
such 
conditions. 
Industrial 
conscription, 
which 
is 
now 
rigidly 
enforced, 
would 
become 
unnecessary. 
Those 
who 
desire 
a 
more 
liberal 
spirit 
would 
be 
able 
to 
make 
their 
voices 
heard 
without 
the 
feeling 
that 
they 
were 
assisting 
reaction 
and 
the 
national 
enemies. 
The 
food 
difficulties 
would 
cease, 
and 
with 
them 
the 
need 
for 
an 
autocratic 
system 
in 
the 
towns. 


It 
must 
not 
be 
assumed, 
as 
is 
common 
with 
opponents 
of 
Bolshevism, 
that 
any 
other 
Government 
could 
easily 
be 
established 
in 
Russia. 
I 
think 
every 
one 
who 
has 
been 
in 
Russia 
recently 
is 
convinced 
that 
the 
existing 
Government 
is 
stable. 
It 
may 
undergo 
internal 
developments, 
and 
might 
easily, 
but 
for 
Lenin, 
become 
a 
Bonapartist 
military 
autocracy. 
But 
this 
would 
be 
a 
change 
from 
within--not 
perhaps 
a 
very 
great 
change--and 
would 
probably 
do 
little 
to 
alter 
the 
economic 
system. 
From 
what 
I 
saw 
of 
the 
Russian 
character 
and 
of 
the 
opposition 
parties, 
I 
became 
persuaded 
that 
Russia 
is 
not 
ready 
for 
any 
form 
of 
democracy, 
and 
needs 
a 
strong 
Government. 
The 
Bolsheviks 
represent 
themselves 
as 
the 
Allies 
of 
Western 
advanced 
Socialism, 
and 
from 
this 
point 
of 
view 
they 
are 
open 
to 
grave 
criticism. 
For 
their 
international 
programme 
there 
is, 
to 
my 
mind, 
nothing 
to 
be 
said. 
But 
as 
a 
national 
Government, 



stripped 
of 
their 
camouflage, 
regarded 
as 
the 
successors 
of 
Peter 
the 
Great, 
they 
are 
performing 
a 
necessary 
though 
unamiable 
task. 
They 
are 
introducing, 
as 
far 
as 
they 
can, 
American 
efficiency 
among 
a 
lazy 
and 
undisciplined 
population. 
They 
are 
preparing 
to 
develop 
the 
natural 
resources 
of 
their 
country 
by 
the 
methods 
of 
State 
Socialism, 
for 
which, 
in 
Russia, 
there 
is 
much 
to 
be 
said. 
In 
the 
Army 
they 
are 
abolishing 
illiteracy, 
and 
if 
they 
had 
peace 
they 
would 
do 
great 
things 
for 
education 
everywhere. 


But 
if 
we 
continue 
to 
refuse 
peace 
and 
trade, 
I 
do 
not 
think 
the 
Bolsheviks 
will 
go 
under. 
Russia 
will 
endure 
great 
hardships, 
in 
the 
years 
to 
come 
as 
before. 
But 
the 
Russians 
are 
inured 
to 
misery 
as 
no 
Western 
nation 
is; 
they 
can 
live 
and 
work 
under 
conditions 
which 
we 
should 
find 
intolerable. 
The 
Government 
will 
be 
driven 
more 
and 
more, 
from 
mere 
self-preservation, 
into 
a 
policy 
of 
imperialism. 
The 
Entente 
has 
been 
doing 
everything 
to 
expose 
Germany 
to 
a 
Russian 
invasion 
of 
arms 
and 
leaflets, 
by 
allowing 
Poland 
to 
engage 
in 
war 
and 
compelling 
Germany 
to 
disarm. 
All 
Asia 
lies 
open 
to 
Bolshevik 
ambitions. 
Almost 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
former 
Russian 
Empire 
in 
Asia 
is 
quite 
firmly 
in 
their 
grasp. 
Trains 
are 
running 
at 
a 
reasonable 
speed 
to 
Turkestan, 
and 
I 
saw 
cotton 
from 
there 
being 
loaded 
on 
to 
Volga 
steamers. 
In 
Persia 
and 
Turkey, 
revolts 
are 
taking 
place, 
with 
Bolshevik 
support. 
It 
is 
only 
a 
question 
of 
a 
few 
years 
before 
India 
will 
be 
in 
touch 
with 
the 
Red 
Army. 
If 
we 
continue 
to 
antagonize 
the 
Bolsheviks, 
I 
do 
not 
see 
what 
force 
exists 
that 
can 
prevent 
them 
from 
acquiring 
the 
whole 
of 
Asia 
within 
ten 
years. 


The 
Russian 
Government 
is 
not 
yet 
definitely 
imperialistic 
in 
spirit, 
and 
would 
still 
prefer 
peace 
to 
conquest. 
The 
country 
is 
weary 
of 
war 
and 
denuded 
of 
goods. 
But 
if 
the 
Western 
Powers 
insist 
upon 
war, 
another 
spirit, 
which 
is 
already 
beginning 
to 
show 
itself, 
will 
become 
dominant. 
Conquest 
will 
be 
the 
only 
alternative 
to 
submission. 
Asiatic 
conquest 
will 
not 
be 
difficult. 
But 
for 
us, 
from 
the 
imperialist 
standpoint, 
it 
will 
mean 
utter 
ruin. 
And 
for 
the 
Continent 
it 
will 
mean 
revolutions, 
civil 
wars, 
economic 
cataclysms. 
The 
policy 
of 
crushing 
Bolshevism 
by 
force 
was 
always 
foolish 
and 
criminal; 
it 
has 
now 
become 
impossible 
and 
fraught 
with 
disaster. 
Our 
own 
Government, 
it 
would 
seem, 
have 
begun 
to 
realize 
the 
dangers, 
but 
apparently 
they 
do 
not 
realize 
them 
sufficiently 
to 
enforce 
their 
view 
against 
opposition. 


In 
the 
Theses 
presented 
to 
the 
Second 
Congress 
of 
the 
Third 
International 
(July 
1920), 
there 
is 
a 
very 
interesting 
article 
by 
Lenin 
called 
"First 
Sketch 
of 



the 
Theses 
on 
National 
and 
Colonial 
Questions" 
(Theses, 
pp. 
40-47). 
The 
following 
passages 
seemed 
to 
me 
particularly 
illuminating:-


The 
present 
world-situation 
in 
politics 
places 
on 
the 
order 
of 
the 
day 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat; 
and 
all 
the 
events 
of 
world 
politics 
are 
inevitably 
concentrated 
round 
one 
centre 
of 
gravity: 
the 
struggle 
of 
the 
international 
bourgeoisie 
against 
the 
Soviet 
Republic, 
which 
inevitably 
groups 
round 
it, 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
the 
Sovietist 
movements 
of 
the 
advanced 
working 
men 
of 
all 
countries, 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
all 
the 
national 
movements 
of 
emancipation 
of 
colonies 
and 
oppressed 
nations 
which 
have 
been 
convinced 
by 
a 
bitter 
experience 
that 
there 
is 
no 
salvation 
for 
them 
except 
in 
the 
victory 
of 
the 
Soviet 
Government 
over 
world-imperialism. 


We 
cannot 
therefore 
any 
longer 
confine 
ourselves 
to 
recognizing 
and 
proclaiming 
the 
union 
of 
the 
workers 
of 
all 
countries. 
It 
is 
henceforth 
necessary 
to 
pursue 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
strictest 
union 
of 
all 
the 
national 
and 
colonial 
movements 
of 
emancipation 
with 
Soviet 
Russia, 
by 
giving 
to 
this 
union 
forms 
corresponding 
to 
the 
degree 
of 
evolution 
of 
the 
proletarian 
movement 
among 
the 
proletariat 
of 
each 
country, 
or 
of 
the 
democratic-
bourgeois 
movement 
of 
emancipation 
among 
the 
workers 
and 
peasants 
of 
backward 
countries 
or 
backward 
nationalities. 


The 
federal 
principle 
appears 
to 
us 
as 
a 
transitory 
form 
towards 
the 
complete 
unity 
of 
the 
workers 
of 
all 
countries. 


This 
is 
the 
formula 
for 
co-operation 
with 
Sinn 
Fein 
or 
with 
Egyptian 
and 
Indian 
nationalism. 
It 
is 
further 
defined 
later. 
In 
regard 
to 
backward 
countries, 
Lenin 
says, 
we 
must 
have 
in 
view:-


The 
necessity 
of 
the 
co-operation 
of 
all 
Communists 
in 
the 
democratic-
bourgeois 
movement 
of 
emancipation 
in 
those 
countries. 


Again: 


"The 
Communist 
International 
must 
conclude 
temporary 
alliances 
with 
the 
bourgeois 
democracy 
of 
backward 
countries, 
but 
must 
never 
fuse 
with 
it." 
The 
class-conscious 
proletariat 
must 
"show 
itself 
particularly 
circumspect 
towards 
the 
survivals 
of 
national 
sentiment 
in 
countries 
long 
oppressed," 
and 
must 
"consent 
to 
certain 
useful 
concessions." 


The 
Asiatic 
policy 
of 
the 
Russian 
Government 
was 
adopted 
as 
a 
move 
against 
the 
British 
Empire, 
and 
as 
a 
method 
of 
inducing 
the 
British 
Government 
to 
make 
peace. 
It 
plays 
a 
larger 
part 
in 
the 
schemes 
of 
the 
leading 
Bolsheviks 
than 
is 
realized 
by 
the 
Labour 
Party 
in 
this 
country. 
Its 
method 
is 
not, 
for 
the 
present, 
to 
preach 
Communism, 
since 
the 
Persians 
and 



Hindoos 
are 
considered 
scarcely 
ripe 
nationalist 
movements 
that 
are 
suppo 
Moscow. 
The 
method 
of 
quasi-independ 
is 
well 
understood. 
It 
is 
obvious 
that 
imperialism, 
under 
the 
cover 
of 
propaga 
among 
the 
Bolsheviks 
are 
fascinated 
by 
officially 
attached 
to 
the 
Eastern 
policy 
subject 
of 
the 
concluding 
portion 
of 
Len 
the 
Third 
International 
(July 
1920). 


Bolshevism, 
like 
everything 
Russian 
One 
may 
distinguish 
two 
distinct 
tr 
policies. 
On 
the 
one 
side 
are 
the 
practic 
industrially, 
to 
secure 
the 
gains 
of 
the 
R 
West, 
and 
gradually 
settle 
down 
into 
a 
men 
have 
on 
their 
side 
the 
fact 
of 
the 
danger 
of 
ultimate 
revolt 
against 
Bolshe 
as 
it 
is 
at 
present, 
and 
the 
natural 
sentim 
the 
sufferings 
of 
the 
people; 
also 
the 
produce 
a 
similar 
collapse 
of 
industry 
Russia 
to 
receive 
the 
outside 
help 
which 
when 
the 
Government 
was 
weak, 
they 
but 
success 
has 
made 
their 
position 
less 


On 
the 
other 
side 
there 
is 
a 
blend 
o 
desire 
to 
promote 
revolution 
in 
the 
W 
Communist 
theory, 
and 
is 
also 
though 
really 
secure 
peace; 
secondly, 
the 
des 
probably 
accompanied 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
rubies 
and 
golden 
thrones 
and 
all 
the 
glo 
desire 
produces 
an 
unwillingness 
to 
aban

that, 
until 
it

do
