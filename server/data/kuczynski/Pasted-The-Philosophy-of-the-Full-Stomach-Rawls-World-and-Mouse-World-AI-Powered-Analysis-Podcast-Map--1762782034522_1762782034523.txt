Abstract

In the 1970s, the psychologist John B. Calhoun built a "mouse utopia"—a sealed habitat where rodents enjoyed unlimited food, water, and safety. Within a few generations the population collapsed: parents neglected their young, males stopped competing or courting, and the colony died out despite abundance. Around the same time, the philosopher John Rawls published A Theory of Justice, describing a perfectly fair society in which inequality and risk were eliminated. One experiment was conducted in a laboratory; the other in a book. Both imagined the same paradise, and both led to the same collapse.

1. Two Utopias

Calhoun's laboratory was a paradise built by human hands. His mice lived in comfort no wild creature could know: constant temperature, endless food, no predators. At first the colony thrived; soon it stagnated. Males withdrew or attacked at random, females ceased to care for litters, and within a few years the population imploded. Calhoun called this a behavioral sink—collapse through ease.

Rawls, writing from the security of post-war America, asked what rules a rational people would choose if they could design society from scratch while ignorant of their future status or talent. The answer, he argued, was a system that neutralized luck and guaranteed fairness for all—a social equivalent of Calhoun's cage, maintained by policy instead of pellets.

Both projects sought justice through the removal of hardship; both replaced interdependence with external provision.

2. The God of Provision

Neither utopia could exist on its own. Calhoun stood outside the glass, refilling the hoppers. Rawls's republic likewise depends on an unseen engine that keeps production, peace, and order flowing. Once that outside support stops—whether scientist or state—the entire equilibrium collapses. These are not self-sustaining worlds; they are terrariums, dependent on a god who never tires.

3. How Abundance Unravels Roles

In nature and in human history, survival has relied on differentiated labor: builders and defenders, caretakers and risk-takers, thinkers and doers. Each role balances the others. Calhoun's environment erased those needs. With no threats to repel or resources to earn, cooperation lost purpose. Some males became passive, grooming themselves endlessly; others turned erratic. Females under chronic stress abandoned offspring. What held the group together was not cruelty but necessity; once necessity vanished, so did society.

Rawls's thought experiment performs the same erasure on a moral level. By treating all advantage as unfair and all dependency as injustice, it dissolves the asymmetries through which meaning and responsibility arise. Guidance becomes hierarchy, protection becomes paternalism, excellence becomes privilege. The social metabolism that trades difference for stability grinds to a halt.

4. The Moralization of Dependence

When comfort is permanent, dependence begins to look virtuous. Calhoun's mice, if they could speak, might have praised their world as peaceful and civilized; they would have called the return of struggle barbaric. Rawls's citizens reason likewise: risk is immoral, competition suspect, inequality intolerable. Both philosophies sanctify a life that can continue only through an external subsidy. What abundance begins, moral idealism completes—it turns dependence into doctrine.

5. The Late-Stage Consciousness

At the end of Calhoun's experiment the survivors spent their days eating, sleeping, and grooming. They were healthy, beautiful, and purposeless. If they had possessed language, they would have defended their comfort as progress and their sterility as refinement. Rawls's vision gives them that vocabulary: the politics of the behavioral sink articulated as ethics. It is how a dying colony would describe its condition to itself while calling it justice.

6. The Contrapositive: Why Tension Sustains Life

The inverse is equally clear. In any ecosystem left to its own devices, creatures endure precisely because scarcity enforces complementarity. Builders need protectors; protectors need nurturers; the strong rely on the wise, and the wise rely on the energetic. Remove those gradients and energy stops circulating. A living society depends not on perfect fairness but on imperfect reciprocity—on the exchange between unlike kinds of strength.

7. Conclusion

Calhoun's mice perished when a god fed them too well. Rawls's ideal citizens would need the same god to feed them forever. Both worlds are comfortable prisons sustained by an external hand, and both die the moment that hand withdraws. The moral is not cynical but structural: interdependence, not provision, keeps a species alive. The effort to design away inequality is, in the end, the effort to design away life itself.
