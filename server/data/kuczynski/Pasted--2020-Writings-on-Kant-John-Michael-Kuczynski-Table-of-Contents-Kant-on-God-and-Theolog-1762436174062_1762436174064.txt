Part 1: Introduction 
The essence of Kant’s conception of God is that God is constitutively, as opposed to causally, responsible for spatiotemporal existence: God is responsible for the world not by creating it but by grounding it. And, so Kant holds, God grounds it by virtue of being identical with it (or, more precisely, with its noumenal substrate: see below), with the qualification that, in being identical with it, he infuses it with his own rationality, this being manifested as natural law. 
Thus, God, for Kant, is sapience (as it is obviously incumbent on 
God qua God to be), and this sapience suffuses the world, its “phenomenal” manifestation being the lawfulness of the natural world.1 
Equivalently, the “noumenal” basis of natural law is a Godly sapience. And 
1 All theodicy should truly be an interpretation of nature insofar as God announces his will through it. Now every interpretation of the declared will of a legislator is either doctrinal or whereas for contemporary scientists and philosophers of science, natural law is either invariable concomitance or blind compulsion, it is in Kant’s view manifestation of God’s rationality. 
Kant’s conception of God does a creditable job of validating, while also eliminating incoherencies from, the common man’s conception God. According to this conception, God has three key attributes: (i) He is sapient; (ii) He is moral; and (iii) He is not only responsible for the world’s existence but also its day-to-day operations. Kant’s God has these three characteristics; moreover, Kant’s conception of God is reasonably coherent. 
There is no other major philosopher whose conception of God isn’t either brazenly incoherent or unacceptably revisionist. Spinoza’s conception of God is coherent—but only because, according to it, God is 
identical with the physical universe and is therefore inanimate.2 
authentic. The first is a rational inference of that will from the utterances of which the law-giver has made use, in conjunction with his otherwise recognized purposes; the second is made by the law-giver himself….As a work of God, the world can also be considered by us as a divine publication of his will’s purposes.

2 Moreover, I will show below, without the aid of this proposition, that neither intellect nor will appertain to God’s nature. I know that there are many who think that they can show, that supreme intellect and free will do appertain to God’s nature; for they say they know of nothing more perfect, which they can attribute to God, than that which is the highest perfection in ourselves. Further, although they conceive God as actually supremely intelligent, they yet do not believe, that he can bring into existence everything which he actually understands, for they think that they would thus destroy God’s power. If, they contend, God had created everything which is in his intellect, he would not be able to create anything more, and this, they think, would clash with God’s omnipotence; therefore, they prefer to assert that God is indifferent to all things, and that he creates nothing except that which he has decided, by some absolute exercise of will, to create. However, I think I have shown sufficiently clearly (by Prop. xvi.), that from God’s supreme power, or infinite nature, an infinite number of things—that is, all things have necessarily flowed forth in an infinite number of ways, or always follow from the same necessity; in the same way as from the nature of a triangle it follows from eternity and for eternity, that its three interior angles are equal to two right angles. Wherefore the 
Aristotle’s God is sapience itself, being pure intellect whose sole activity is self-contemplation— but only because, in thus being so unqualifiedly sapient, he is devoid of both emotion and morality.3 

As for the common man’s conception of God, it is too riddled with incoherencies to be accepted on its own terms: God created the world without being distinct from it, and he is objective while also caring about us and to that extent non-objective. Since the philosopher has no choice but to reject this conception of God, his job is to produce a ‘rational reconstruction’ 
omnipotence of God has been displayed from all eternity, and will for all eternity remain in the same state of activity. This manner of treating the question attributes to God an omnipotence, in my opinion, far more perfect. For, otherwise, we are compelled to confess that God understands an infinite number of creatable things, which he will never be able to create, for, if he created all that he understands, he would, according to this showing, exhaust his omnipotence, and render himself imperfect. Wherefore, in order to establish that God is perfect, we should be reduced to establishing at the same time, that he cannot bring to pass everything over which his power extends; this seems to be a hypothesis most absurd, and most repugnant to God’s omnipotence.

3 And thinking in itself deals with that which is best in itself, and that which is thinking in the fullest sense with that which is best in the fullest sense. And thought thinks on itself because it shares the nature of the object of thought; for it becomes an object of thought in coming into contact with and thinking its objects, so that thought and object of thought are the same. For that which is capable of receiving the object of thought, 
i.e. the essence, is thought. But it is active when it possesses this object. Therefore the possession rather than the receptivity is the divine element which thought seems to contain, and the act of contemplation is what is most pleasant and best. If, then, God is always in that good state in which we sometimes are, this compels our wonder; and if in a better this compels it yet more. And God is in a better state. And life also belongs to God; for the actuality of thought is life, and God is that actuality; and God’s self-dependent actuality is life most good and eternal. We say therefore that God is a living being, eternal, most good, so that life and duration continuous and eternal belong to God; for this is God.

of it, meaning that he must construct a concept that, while being coherent, is sufficiently in alignment with the common man’s conception of God that it can be said to have the same referent. Kant’s conception of God does a relatively good of satisfying this requirement, as the present paper will show. 
Part 2: Kant’s Theoretical Framework 
Kant’s philosophy as a whole is rooted in his epistemology. The essence of his epistemological system is the contention that not all knowledge can be derived from experience, the reason being that knowledge is a prerequisite for the derivation of knowledge from experience and, indeed, for experience itself. Kant therefore advocated a 
form of the doctrine that Chomsky refers to as nativism.4 

Nativism is to be distinguished from rationalism. Rationalism is the position at least some knowledge is derived from reason, as opposed to observation. My knowledge that there 
4 Our cognition arises from two fundamental sources in the mind, the first of which is the reception of representations (the receptivity of impressions), the second the faculty for cognizing an object by means of these representations (spontaneity of concepts); through the former an object is given to us, through the latter it is thought in relation to that representation (as a mere determination of the mind). Intuition and concepts therefore constitute the elements of all our cognition, so that neither concepts without intuition corresponding to them in some way nor intuition without concepts can1 yield a cognition. Both are either pure or empirical. Empirical, if sensation (which presupposes the actual presence of the object) is contained therein; but pure if no sensation is mixed into the representation. One can call the latter the matter of sensible cognition. Thus pure intuition contains merely the form under which something is intuited, and pure concept only the form of thinking of an object in general. [B 75] Only pure intuitions or concepts alone are possible a priori, empirical ones only a posteriori.[ 
Kant, Immanuel. Critique of Pure Reason (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant) (Kindle Locations 4729-4736). Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition. 
are infinitely many primes is reason-based, as opposed to observation-based, but I obviously wasn’t born with that knowledge. And, at least arguably, a creature’s knowledge that snakes are dangerous is necessarily empirical, even though it may also be innate. (Innate empirical knowledge, supposing that it exists, is ancestral knowledge, meaning that it is based on observation, albeit those of ancestors.) Kant self-identified as a rationalist, not as a nativist, and he did not use the term ‘nativism’ (any equivalent) to refer to his own position. 
Kant held that space and time (or inborn cognitive representations thereof) are necessary to have a coherent stream of experiences; and he also held that inborn representations of categories—similar to those found in Aristotle’s system of logic—are needed to make judgements about, and 
therefore to derive knowledge from, one’s experiences.5 
In a word, some kind of innate cognitive structure is necessary to have experiences and derive knowledge from them.6 

5 Space is not an empirical concept that has been drawn from outer experiences. For in order for certain sensations to be related to something outside me (i.e., to something in another place in space from that in which I find myself), thus in order for me to represent them as outside one another, thus not merely as different but as in different places, the representation of space must already be their ground.7 Thus the representation of space cannot be obtained from the relations of outer appearance through experience, but this outer experience is itself first possible only through this representation. 
Kant, Immanuel. Critique of Pure Reason (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant) (Kindle Locations 3778-3784). Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition. 
Time is not an empirical concept that is somehow drawn from an experience. For simultaneity or succession would not themselves come into perception if the representation of time did not ground them a priori. Only under its presupposition can one represent that several things exist at one and the same time (simultaneously) or in different times (successively).

6 Insofar as there is to be reason in these sciences, something in them must be cognized a priori, and this cognition can relate to its object in either of two ways, either merely determining the object and its concept (which must be given from elsewhere), or else also 
Kant sometimes uses the term “concept” in the same way that 
we use it, namely, to refer to any mental representation of an abstract 
object, such as a number or category. 
According to Kant, many concepts, including our concepts of space and 
time, are “hard-wired” into us. Having a given such “hardwired” concept 
involves having knowledge of a kind---knowledge as to how to structure 
information. For Kant, consequently, there are two kinds of knowledge: 
Knowledge derived from experience and knowledge that makes such 
derivations possible. Knowledge is a posteriori when derived from 
experience and a priori when it makes experience and experience-based 
knowledge possible.7 

making the object actual. The former is theoretical, the latter practical 
cognition of reason. In both the pure part, the part in which reason 
determines its object7 wholly a priori, must be expounded all by itself,

7 [A]lthough all our cognition commences with experience, yet it does not on that account all arise from experience. For it could well be that even our experiential cognition is a composite of that which we receive through impressions and that which our own cognitive faculty (merely prompted by sensible impressions) provides out of itself, which addition we cannot distinguish from that fundamental material until long practice has made us attentive to it and skilled in separating it out.[B 2] It is therefore at least a question requiring closer investigation, and one not to be dismissed at first glance, whether there is any such cognition independent of all experience and even of all impressions of the senses. One calls such cognitions a priori,3 and distinguishes them from empirical ones, which have their sources a posteriori, namely in experience.8 The former expression4 is nevertheless not yet sufficiently determinate to designate the whole sense of the question before us. For it is customary to say of many a cognition derived from experiential sources that we are capable of it or partake in it a priori, because we do not derive it immediately from experience, but rather from a general rule that we have nevertheless itself borrowed from experience. So one says of someone who undermined the foundation of his house that he could have known a priori that it would collapse, i.e., he need not have waited for the experience of it actually collapsing. Yet he could not have known this entirely a priori.9 For that bodies are heavy and hence fall if their support is taken away must first have become known to him through experience. In the sequel therefore we will understand by a priori cognitions not those that occur independently of this or that experience, but rather those that occur absolutely independently of all experience. Opposed to them are empirical cognitions, or those that are possible only a posteriori, i.e., through experience.[B 3] Among a priori cognitions, however, those are called pure with which 
Kant holds—because he believes it to follow from the position just-described (or, at least, from his specific version of it)---that space and time themselves have no objective existence, being mere cognitive categories; and he also believes (partly, it seems, because it is a corollary of his subjectivism about space and time) that we cannot have knowledge of the world as it is, only as it appears to us. To use his terms, we can know 
phenomena (appearances), but not noumena (realities).8 

This must be understood aright. It is obvious and trivial that we know the world through appearances, and that appearances both distort reality in some respects and also omit a great deal of important information. But Kant’s position is not that we do know “noumena”, albeit imperfectly and distortedly, but rather that we simply don’t know them—at least through sense-perception. Kant clearly does hold that we can know about them—if only that they are there and that we otherwise are ignorant of them—but he holds that, so far as we do have 
nothing empirical is intermixed. Thus, e.g., the proposition “Every alteration has its cause” is an a priori proposition, only not pure, since alteration is a concept that can be drawn only from experience.

8 Space is nothing other than merely the form of all appearances of outer sense, i.e., the subjective condition of sensibility, under which alone outer intuition is possible for us. Now since the receptivity of the subject to be affected by objects necessarily precedes all intuitions of these objects, it can be understood how the form of all appearances can be given in the mind prior to all actual perceptions, thus a priori, and how as a pure intuition, in which all objects must be determined, it can contain principles20 of their relations prior to all experience.21 We can accordingly speak of space, extended beings, and so on, only from the human standpoint. If we depart from the subjective condition under which alone we can acquire outer intuition, namely that through which we may be affected by objects, then the representation of space signifies nothing at all.

knowledge of noumena, that knowledge is transcendental (reason-based9), as opposed to 
empirical (observation-based).10 

In the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant talks about what noumena are not (namely, they are not observable or even knowable through observation) but says very little, if anything, about what they are. In the Critique of Practical Reason (“the second critique”), Kant says that God is a noumenon and that any given human soul is a noumenon. In the second critique, Kant

10 Now from this arises the concept of a noumenon, which, however, is not at all positive and does not signify a determinate cognition of any sort of thing, but rather only the thinking of something in general, in which I abstract from all form of sensible intuition. But in order for a noumenon to signify a true object, to be distinguished from all phenomena, it is not enough that I liberate my thoughts from all conditions of sensible intuition, but I must in addition have ground to assume another kind of intuition than this sensible one, under which such an object could be given; for otherwise my thought is empty, even though free of contradiction. To be sure, above we were able to prove not that sensible intuition is the only possible intuition, but rather that it is the only one possible for us; but we also could not prove that yet another kind of intuition is possible, and, although our thinking can abstract from that sensibility, the question still remains whether it is not then a mere form of a concept and whether any object85 at all is left over after this separation. The object to which I relate appearance in general is the transcendental object, i.e., the entirely undetermined thought of something in general. This cannot be called the noumenon; for I do not know anything about what it is in itself, and have no concept of it except merely that of the object of a sensible intuition in general, which is therefore the same for all appearances. I cannot think it through any categories; for these hold of empirical intuition, in order to bring it under a concept of the object in general. To be sure, a pure use of the category is possible, i.e., without contradiction, but it has no objective validity, since it pertains to no intuition that would thereby acquire unity of the object;61 for the category is a mere function of thinking, through which no object is given to me, but rather only that through which what may be given in intuition is thought. 
Kant, Immanuel. Critique of Pure Reason (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant) (Kindle Locations 8596-8612). Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition. 
also asserts that, by virtue of being a noumenon as opposed to a phenomenon, the human soul is free.11 

This last contention must be understood in terms of the system put forth in the first critique, according to which it is the phenomenal, not the noumenal, world that is to be known observationally and, therefore, scientifically. According to Kant, a corollary is that it is the phenomenal, not the noumenal, world that is law-governed, i.e. governed by natural law and therefore deterministic. A corollary of this corollary, so Kant holds, is 
that the very concept of deterministic compulsion is that the soul—being as it is, in Kant’s view, a noumenon, as opposed to a phenomenon--is free.12 

11 By this I also understand why the most considerable objections to the Critique that have so far come to my attention turn about just these two points: namely, on the one side the objective reality of the categories applied to noumena, denied in theoretical cognition and affirmed in practical, and on the other side the paradoxical requirement to make oneself as subject of freedom a noumenon but at the same, with regard to nature, a phenomenon in one’s own empirical consciousness; for, as long as one had as yet formed no determinate concepts of morality and freedom, one could not conjecture, on the one side, what one was to put as a noumenon at the basis of the alleged appearance and, on the other side, whether it was at all possible even to form a concept of it, since all the concepts of the pure understanding in its theoretical use had already been assigned exclusively to mere appearances. Only a detailed Critique of Practical Reason can remove all this misinterpretation and put in a clear light the consistent way of thinking that constitutes its greatest merit.

12 The ideas of God and immortality, however, are not conditions of the moral law but only conditions of the necessary object of a will determined by this law, that is, of the mere practical use of our pure reason; hence with respect to those ideas we cannot affirm that we cognize and have insight into – I do not merely say the reality but even the possibility of them. But they are, nevertheless, conditions of applying the morally determined will to its object given to it a priori (the highest good). Consequently their possibility in this practical relation can and must be assumed, although we cannot theoretically cognize and have insight into them. For practical purposes it is sufficient for this assumption that they contain no intrinsic impossibility (contradiction). Here there is a ground of assent that is, in comparison with speculative reason, merely subjective but that is yet objectively valid for a reason equally pure but practical; by 
In some contexts, Kant uses the term “concept” and “idea” interchangeably; but in other contexts, he uses the term “concept” to refer to refer to abstract actualities (e.g. the human species), while using the term “idea” to refer specifically to representations either of idealizations (e.g. frictionless surface) or of actualities that cannot possibly be known through or on the basis of observation. Kant cites three examples of such actualities, namely, God, human souls (including one’s own), and human freedom (including one’s own). Also, Kant tends to refer to a given representation as an “idea” only if he believes that having it is necessary for being a rational actor. And so it is that, according to Kant, a creature must have the ‘idea’ of freedom if it is to be able to act (i.e. if it is to be an agent), and it must have the ‘ideas’ of both God and immortality if it is to be able to act ethically. 
The intuitive basis for these claims is clear enough. I can regard myself as unfree in my capacity as thinker, but not in my capacity as an agent. When it comes to act, the operative conceit is that it is up to me what to do, and any conceits I have concerning my inability to act 
means of the concept of freedom objective reality is given to the ideas of God and immortality and a warrant, 
Kant, Immanuel. Practical Philosophy (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant) (p. 140). Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition. 
With this faculty transcendental freedom is also established, taken indeed in that absolute sense in which speculative reason needed it, in its use of the concept of causality, in order to rescue itself from the antinomy into which it unavoidably falls when it wants to think the unconditioned in the series of causal connection; this concept, however, it could put forward only problematically, as not impossible to think, without assuring it objective reality, and only lest the supposed impossibility of what it must at least allow to be thinkable call its being into question and plunge it into an abyss of skepticism.

drop out, to be reactivated only during such respites from as permit philosophical reflection.13 
As for the contentions that representations of— 
and belief in--God and immortality are necessary for morality, this is obviously more questionable, but the idea is clear enough. If we are mortal, then, so it seems, our attitude might as well be apres moi le deluge14; and 
if there is no God, so it seems (and so Dostoevsky’s famous adage goes), then everything is permitted.15 

13 [H]ence he always admits freedom to think, without which there is no reason. In the same way he must also assume freedom of the will in acting, without which there would be no morals, when – as I have no doubt – he wants to proceed in his righteous conduct in conformity with the eternal laws of duty and not to be a plaything of his instincts and inclinations, though at the same time he denies himself this freedom because he is not otherwise able to bring his practical principles into harmony with speculative principles. But even if no one were to succeed in this, in fact not much would be lost.

14 This endless progress is, however, possible only on the presupposition of the existence and personality of the same rational being continuing endlessly (which is called the immortality of the soul). Hence the highest good is practically possible only on the presupposition of the immortality of the soul, so that this, as inseparably connected with the moral law, is a postulate of pure practical reason (by which I understand a theoretical proposition, though one not demonstrable as such, insofar as it is attached inseparably to an a priori unconditionally valid practical law).

15 In the preceding analysis the moral law led to a practical task that is set by pure reason alone and without the aid of any sensible incentives, 
namely that of the necessary completeness of the first and principal part of the highest good, morality; and, since this can be fully accomplished only in an eternity, it led to the postulate of immortality. The same law must also lead to the possibility of the second element of the highest good, namely happiness proportioned to that morality, and must do so as disinterestedly as before, solely from impartial reason; in other words, it must lead to the supposition of the existence of a cause adequate to this effect, that is, it must postulate the existence of God as belonging necessarily to the possibility of the highest good (which object of our will is necessarily connected with the moral lawgiving of pure reason). We shall present this connection in a convincing manner.

Kant’s own reasons for accepting these three contentions appear to be elaborations of these commonplace conceits. 
Part 3: Kant on the Ontological, Teleological, and Cosmological Arguments for God’s Existence 
Kant’s conception of God is to be understood largely in terms of his criticisms of two arguments for God’s existence, namely: the Cosmological (since the space-time manifold cannot have been created by anything in space, its cause must be supernatural and therefore 
identical with God16) and the Physicotheological, more commonly known as the Teleological (the world embodies lawfulness, and the entity whose rationality is therein embodied is ipso facto God17). 
16 Here I presuppose that something exists, hence an experience, and thus the proof built on this presupposition is no longer derived from pure reason, as was the transcendental proof already discussed. It is, however, the simplest experience that I can presuppose: the experience that I am. Now I infer with Leibniz and Wolff:7 I am either necessary or contingent. But the alterations which go on in me show that I am not necessary; therefore I am contingent. But if I am contingent, then there must be somewhere outside me a ground for my existence, which is the reason why I am as I am and not otherwise. This ground of my existence must be absolutely necessary. For if it too were contingent, then it could not be the ground of my existence, since it would once again have need of something else containing the ground of its existence. This absolutely necessary being, however, must contain in itself the ground of its own existence, and consequently the ground of the existence of the whole world. For the whole world is contingent, and hence it cannot contain in itself the ground why it is as it is and not otherwise. But a being which contained in itself the ground of the existence of all things would also have to contain in itself the ground of its own existence; for there is nothing from which it could be derived. – And this is God! 
Kant, Immanuel. Religion and Rational Theology (The Cambridge 
Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant) (Kindle Locations 7861­7864). Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition. 
17 The physicotheological proof is the one in which we infer from the constitution of the present world to the nature of its author. This proof is nearly identical with the cosmological one; the 
Kant rejects the cosmological argument on the ground that it turns God into just another cause, albeit a singularly important one. If God is just a ‘first cause’, then he is indeed just a cause, differing from others in magnitude and significance but not in kind. Therefore, the cosmological argument proves at most that there is an important being that falls short of 
being God. 18 

only difference is that in the cosmological proof the concept of an author of the world is abstracted from the concept of a world in general, whereas in the physicotheological proof it is abstracted from the present world. 
Kant, Immanuel. Religion and Rational Theology (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant) (Kindle Locations 7870­7874). Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition. 
18 I could never prove God’s omnipotence through experience, even if I assume a million suns surrounded with a million universes in an immeasurably immense space, with each of these universes occupied by both rational and irrational creatures. For a great power could have produced even a hundred million and a thousand million suns. From anything made I could infer only a great power, an immeasurable power. – But what is meant by an “immeasurable power”? A power which I have no capacity to measure, over against which my power is extremely small. That, however, is still not omnipotence. – Likewise, even though I may wonder at the magnitude, order and chainlike combination of all things in the world, I cannot conclude that only one being has produced them. There could just as easily have been several powerful beings, each taking pleasure in working its own field.9 Or at least I cannot refute this supposition from my experience of the world. 
Kant, Immanuel. Religion and Rational Theology (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant) (Kindle Locations 7887­7895). Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition. 
Theism consists in believing not merely in a God, but in a living God who has produced the world through knowledge and by means of free will. It can now be seen that theologia transcendentalis is set up by pure reason alone, wholly pure of any admixture of experience. But this is not the case with natural theology. In it some kinds of experience must be mixed in, since I must have an example such as an intelligence (for instance, the human power of understanding, from which I infer the highest understanding). 
Kant, Immanuel. Religion and Rational Theology (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant) (Kindle Locations 7771­7775). Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition. 
Kant rejects the teleological argument on much the same grounds. If God is just a ‘first cause’, with the qualification that embodies his sapience in the world, then thereafter ceases to be relevant, and the world is a mere 
fossil-record, as opposed to living expression, of his sapience.19 

In Kant’s view, both arguments establish the existence of a God-like being, his point being that God-like falls short of God-identical. Kant does not regard either argument as otherwise defective. By contrast, Kant regards the Ontological Argument (God has every perfection, including existence, and therefore exists) as embodying a correct conception of what God is but as failing to establish the existence of anything corresponding to it. Kant’s position is that existence is not a “predicate”, meaning that one cannot meaningfully say of this or that specific individual that he exists, since such an assertion is self-contradictory if false and void of content 
(and therefore a non-assertion) if true.20 

19 But the physicotheological proof is derived wholly from empirical principles, because here I use my actual perception of the existing world as its ground.[28:1008] But if transcendental theology does not succeed, physicotheology will not succeed either. For physicotheology can never give a determinate concept of God without transcendental theology, and an indeterminate concept doesn’t help at all. The precise concept of God is the concept of a most perfect thing. But I can never derive such a concept from experience, for the highest perfection can never be given me in any possible experience.

It is when he is critiquing the Ontological Argument that Kant makes it clear what believes God to be and how he believes God’s existence to be proven. In his view, God is—and the Ontological Argument assumes God to be---a “maximum of reality from which it can proceed and according to which it can measure other things.” Whereas the teleological and cosmological arguments assumed God to be a mere occasioning cause, the Ontological Argument, so Kant holds, rightly assumes him to be an “ens realissimum” (maximally real entity), with the qualification that, In Kant’s view, being a “maximally real” entity involves being that in which 
and through which all else exists.21 
“A thing of this kind,” writes Kant, “in which all realities are contained, would be the only complete thing, because it is perfectly determined in regard to all possible predicates” and, consequently, “would also be the ground of the possibility of all other 
beings.”22 

There is another respect in which, according to Kant, the Ontological Argument is rightly conceived and in which the other two arguments are misconceived. The Ontological Argument, Kant rightly observes, is a purely conceptual, being to the effect that it would be incoherent— 
these universes occupied by both rational and irrational creatures. For a great power could have produced even a hundred million and a thousand million suns.

and therefore counter-conceptual, as opposed to merely counter-observational —to deny God’s existence. By contrast, the cosmological and teleological arguments are empirical (or semi-empirical), being cases of inference from effect (spatiotemporal reality) to putative cause (God). According to Kant, God’s existence cannot possibly be established on empirical grounds, since we cannot know on such grounds that an infinitely intelligent or powerful creature exists: 
But the physicotheological proof is derived wholly from empirical principles, because here I use my actual perception of the existing world as its ground. But if transcendental theology does not succeed, physicotheology will not succeed either. For physicotheology can never give a determinate concept of God without transcendental theology, and an indeterminate concept doesn’t help at all. The precise concept of God is the concept of a most perfect thing. But I can never derive such a concept from experience, for the highest perfection can never be given me in any possible experience. For example, I could never prove God’s omnipotence through experience, even if I assume a million suns surrounded with a million universes in an immeasurably immense space, with each of these universes occupied by both rational and irrational creatures. For a great power could have produced even a hundred million and a thousand million suns. From anything made, I could infer only a great power, an immeasurable power. – But what is meant by an “immeasurable power”? A power which I have no capacity to measure, over against which my power is extremely small. That, however, is still not omnipotence. – Likewise, even though I may wonder at the magnitude, order and chainlike combination of all things in the world, I cannot conclude 
that only one being has produced them.23 

In other words, what we observe is finite and therefore warrants our positing finite causes, not infinite ones, and therefore does not warrant our positing God’s existence. Therefore, God’s existence is to be proved on conceptual, as opposed to causal, grounds and therefore through an argument that, like the Ontological Argument and unlike the other two, is transcendental. 
This is subject to a qualification, says Kant, namely, that even though knowledge of God’s existence is strictly reason-based, knowledge of his nature is at least partly observation-based. This is because we know the world through observation, and the world, being God’s creation, bears his imprint. 
Let us take stock. In Kant’s view, God is more than, or other than, a cause of spatiotemporal reality. At the same time, God is in some way or other responsible for the universe’s existence, and, what is more, he has some distinctively human attributes, the most important one being sapience. We will now discuss how Kant reconciles these various contentions into a single, relatively coherent view and, moreover, how he could defend that view.

Part 4: Kant’s Conception of God 
Kant’s conception of God is that he is responsible for the world not by causing but by grounding it—basically, by the being the sapience that informs it.24 
The question arises: If God is responsible for the world by being it, then there is no difference between Kant’s position and that of someone who, while denying God’s existence, concedes the obvious fact 
that the universe exists.25 
We will now see that, thanks to his epistemological system, Kant can coherently regard God as being both sapient and constitutive of the universe, this being consistent with what his own text sometimes suggests that he believes. 
Like Kant, Spinoza believed it incoherent to regard God as a first cause and, like Kant, inferred that God must be the universe. But Spinoza reasoned that, since the universe (setting aside the odd flicker of consciousness) is so much inanimate matter and void, the same is therefore true of God. By contrast, Kant’s reasoning is that since God is that the universe is sapient (and therefore animate) matter and void, its sapience being expressed in its

The concept of an ens originarium as an ens summum belongs to transcendental philosophy. This transcendental concept, in fact, is the foundation of transcendental philosophy and there is a special theology in which I think of the original being as the ens originarium to which belongs the properties of not deriving from any other thing and of being the root of everything.

lawfulness.26 
Leibniz held a similar view, necessary truths, he held, being mental representations of God’s. 
The obvious response is that ‘lawful’ is not the same as ‘rational.’ Natural laws give rise to order and predictability, it will be said, and their manifestations are to that extent similar to those of rational conduct; but ‘similar’ is not ‘identical’, and natural laws represent blind compulsion, not intelligence. 
Kant’s counter-response is that although a world driven by blind compulsion might be predictable, it would not, unlike the actual world, be intelligible. This response is obviously both vague and questionable. But following Bertrand Russell (1948), I believe that implicit in Kant’s system is another, possibly more cogent response, namely, that were we to be aware of the noumena underlying the phenomena of which observation apprises us, we would see them to be instances of veritable sapience. 
Russell (1948, p. 248) writes: 
[W]hile mental events and their qualities can be known without inference, physical events are known only as regards their space-time structure. The qualities that compose such 
26 We can form a concept of the universal and unconditional subjection of human beings to the divine legislation only insofar as we also consider ourselves his creatures; just so can God be considered the ultimate source of all natural laws only because he is the creator of natural things. It is, however, totally incomprehensible to our reason how beings can be created to use their powers freely, for according to the principle of causality we cannot attribute any other inner ground of action to a being, which we assume to have been produced, except that which the producing cause has placed in it.

3316). Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition. 
events are unknown — so completely unknown that we cannot say either that they are, or that they are not, different from the qualities that we know as belonging to mental events. 
In other words, for all we know, it could be awareness that has the formal properties we know mass-energy to have. 
Kant’s system makes it an option for him to suppose that, indeed, those non-structural properties of objects and events are mental in nature. Kant can, without contradicting himself, take the position that those structural properties are “phenomena” whose corresponding “noumena” are instances of sapience. Indeed, not only is this position open to Kant; it is positively de rigueur, given his otherwise indefensible contention that God, while constituting the world, is nonetheless sapient. It also gives substance to his otherwise vacuous contention that the orderliness of the universe expressions bona fide rationality, as opposed to blind compulsion.

Introduction 
What follows is an analytic summary of Chapter Three, Sections Three to Seven (pp. 559-589) of the Critique of Pure Reason (Guyer Translation). In this material, Kant evaluates what he claims to be the only three possible ‘speculative’ methods of proving God’s existence. 
The reading is divided into several sections. I will summarize each section, anchoring my summary in illustrative quotations. I will then briefly discuss the merits and demerits of that section. 
Kant does not in this context put forth his own views as to how to prove God’s existence, only how, in his view, God’s existence is not to be proved. Kant’s views as to how God’s existence is to be proved, and also as to how he conceives of God, sometimes emerge but are never directly argued for---mainly, I suspect, because he was still working them out. 
This reading is divided into the following sections:

Chapter Three Section Four contains an important subsection, “There

reason”, to which I will dedicate a section of its own. 
Right now I will briefly summarize the material, and I will then 
proceed to the section-by-section summary. 
Summary of this presentation 
In this reading, Kant discusses three arguments for God’s existence: 
the ontological, the cosmological, and the teleological. Kant uses the term 
‘physico-theological’ instead of ‘teleological.’ 
The essence of the ontological argument is that God cannot fail to 
exist since God has every perfection and existence is a perfection. 
Kant’s discussion of the ontological argument is long and 
technical, but the gist of it is that he believes it to embody a muddle 
similar to that involved in someone’s believing that, since the Average 
American has 1.3 children, there must be some specific individual who 
has 
1.3 children. Kant’s attitude towards the Ontological argument is curiously 
ambivalent. He spends pages and pages arguing that it is spurious, but he also appears to accept a version of it, as we will discuss. 
The essence of the cosmological argument is that, whereas events within the universe have universe-internal causes, the cause or basis of the universe itself cannot possibly be universe-internal and, so it is alleged to follow, must therefore be God. 
The gist of Kant’s assessment of this argument is that, were it cogent, it would simply turn God into another cause, albeit an unusually important one, and that God is appropriately thought of not as the cause of the universe but as its ground. 
The essence of the teleological argument is that, given how intricately and—by all appearances—intelligently structured it is, the universe must be the work of a sapient being. 
The gist of Kant’s assessment of this argument is that, were it cogent, this argument would establish the existence of a great craftsman whose lot it was to arrange pre-existing materials in accordance with pre­existing laws and who, for that reason, could not possibly be God, since God, according to Kant, is responsible not just for the way the materials are arranged, but also for those materials themselves, along with the laws governing their assembly. 
A theme that recurs throughout this reading is that the arguments traditionally given for God’s existence fail to do him justice, in that they turn him into a mere cause of existence, as opposed to a ground or justification for it, and thereby give his relationship to reality a fortuitous character. 
Another theme is that both “transcendental” (strictly logical) and “natural” (observation-based) methods of thinking about God complement each other, with the former providing rigorous proofs of his existence, but telling us little about what he is like, and the latter telling us what he is like, but failing to prove his existence. 
Summary of Chapter Three Section Three “The grounds of proof of speculative reason for inferring the existence of a highest being” 
Things that exist contingently (i.e. accidentally) do so only thanks to something that exists necessarily: 
(1) 
“If something, no matter what, exists, then it must also be conceded that something exists necessarily” (560). 

Kant then attempts to prove this principle: 

(2) 
“For the contingent exists only under the condition of something else as its cause, and from this the same inference holds further all the way to a cause not existing contingently and therefore necessarily without condition” (560). 

(2) 
really just restates (1) and is therefore question-begging and devoid of force. But (2) is really just a misconceived way of expressing a line of reasoning that, unlike (2), does have force, namely: 

(3) 
Let X be some contingent being. X’s existence is a mere accident, but the possibility of X’s existence cannot possibly be a mere accident. It is an accident which possibilities are actualized, but not which possibilities exist to be actualized. Therefore, the basis of the possibility of X’s existing lies in something that, unlike X itself, exists necessarily. 


(3) is a line of reasoning that comes up again and again in Kant’s work. In what remains of this section, Kant very obscurely touches on 
some ideas that he discusses more thoroughly later on. First, he mentions the Ontological argument: 
(4) “[Once] reason takes it as already settled that something or other exists with absolute necessity, [it then tries to] derive it from its concept alone” (560) 
In other words, once people realize that there exists a necessary being, they are tempted to show that the very concept of that being entails its own existence. Put more simply, 
(5) God does exist because he could exist, 
this being the essence of the Ontological argument. 
Elsewhere, Kant rejects the Ontological argument. But in this particular context, he seems, possibly unwittingly, to be accepting a version of it. 
Kant also cryptically but pregnantly says that “the unity of reality is…the basis of possibility” (561). 
It is not clear what he means by this, but it obviously ties into a proof that he gives elsewhere of the existence of God, namely: 
(6) 
Nature is not merely orderly but also unified, i.e. coherent, which bespeaks the existence of a higher sapient being. 

Kant also vaguely seems to put forth an argument to the effect that there can be only one God: 

(7) 
“[A] being that contains all reality, hence all conditions, [is] absolutely unconditioned and [is therefore] a thing which is suited for absolute necessity” (562). 


This argument seems to be to the following effect: 
(8) Anything capable of being God must “contain all of reality”, 
i.e. not only be solely responsible for all of reality but also constitute it. Given that there obviously can exist at most one such being, there can only be one God. 
One of the conceits embodied in this argument is that God is to be thought of not as the cause of reality but as its ground, the idea being that, if God were a mere cause, he would ultimately be just another run-of-the-mill occupant of space-time, whereas he is more than this if he is its ground. 
On page 562, Kant puts forth an extremely obscure argument that seems to concern some kind of link between our moral obligations and God’s existence: 
(9) 
“For suppose there were obligations that were entirely correct in the idea of reason but would have no real application to us, i.e. would be without any incentives, if a highest being were not presupposed, who could give effect and emphasis to the practical laws; then we would also have an obligation to follow those concepts, that even though they may not be objectively sufficient, are still preponderant in accordance with the measure of our reason, and in comparison with which we recognize nothing better or more convincing” (562). 

The key idea here seems to be this: 

(10) 
there are certain rules that we simply have to follow, even though following them does not in and of itself do us any good; but thanks to God’s existence, we have some kind of practical reason to follow these rules. 


Obviously, (10) is a weak (or enthymematic) argument, but it is very hard to find any other meaning in (9); and there is evidence in other parts of Kant that he thought along these lines. 
In the last paragraph of this section, Kant brings together some of the just-discussed points: 
(11) “One sees things alter, arise, and perish; therefore…they must have a cause…Now where could we more appropriately locate the supreme causality than right where the highest causality is, i.e. in that being originally containing within itself what is sufficient for the possible effect, whose concept also comes about very easily through the single trait of an all-encompassing perfection” (562). 
The idea here seems to be that God exists unconditionally and is himself the condition for everything else’s existence. 
Summary of There are only three kinds of proof for the existence of God possible from speculative reason 
The main point of this subsection is that there are indeed that only thee creditable proofs of God’s existence that are based on ‘speculative reason’, these being the ontological, cosmological, and teleological arguments. The first sentence in this section gives us some information as to what Kant means by this and why he regards it as true: 
(*) “All paths on which may set forth with this aim either begin from determinate experiences and the special constitution of our world of sense known through it, and ascend from that by means of laws of causality to the highest cause outside the world; or else they are empirically grounded on an experience that is only indeterminate, i.e. on some existence; or, finally, they abstract from all experience and infer the existence of a highest cause entirely a priori from mere concepts” (561). 
The first kind of reasoning is garden-variety inference to the best-explanation. An example: I see footprints in the sand and on that basis realize that there is another person on the island. 
Kant says that the teleological argument is an example of this kind of reasoning: “The first proof is physico-theological.” 
The second kind also seems to be inference to the best explanation, with the qualification that the fact being explained is an existential generalization, i.e. a statement of the form ‘something has property phi.’ An example: Even though I personally cannot identify a single specific person who suffers from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, I also know that the number of high schoolers with this condition has tripled in the last two years, and on that basis I realize that many high schools must have lifted their ban on football and other contact sports. 
Kant says that the cosmological argument is an example of this kind of reasoning: “[T]he second [proof is]…cosmological.” 
What is unclear to me is why, in Kant’s view, the teleological argument and cosmological arguments are instances of two different kinds of explanation. Obviously, they are not the same explanation, but they both see to be inferences to the best explanation; and neither seems any more or less dependent than the other on premises that are existence-claims. 
The third kind is purely conceptual. An example: A proof that there 
exists a unique even 
prime. 
Kant says, obviously correctly, that the ontological argument is an 
example of this kind 
of reasoning: “[T]he third [proof is]…cosmological.” That is to say, the ontological argument is meant to be a purely conceptual, as opposed to empirical, proof. 
In the second paragraph of this two-paragraph section, Kant says that: “…reason accomplishes just as little on the one path (the empirical) as on the other (the transcendental) and that it spreads its wings in vain when seeking to rise above the world through the mere might of speculation.” 
I find this puzzling since Kant gives transcendental arguments for God’s existence in his paper “the only possible proof of God’s existence.” 
Chapter Three Section Four On an impossibility of an ontological proof of God’s existence 
The point of this section is that the ontological argument involves some kind of failure to understand the logical properties of attributions of existence. 
Kant seems to say that, given some specific object X, it makes little sense to attribute existence to X, since X’s existence is indeed assumed, and it therefore makes absolutely no sense to deny its existence. 
(*) “I ask you: Is the proposition This or that thing…exists---is this proposition, I say, an analytic or a synthetic proposition? If it is the 
former, then with existence you add nothing to your thought of the thing… If you concede, on the contrary, as in all fairness you must, that 
every existential proposition is synthetic, then how would you assert that the predicate of existence may not be cancelled without contradiction?” (566) 
The question arises: under what circumstances are attributions and denials of existence meaningful? 
The contemporary answer is that existence-claims concern classes. If you say that flying monkeys exist, you are saying that the class of such creatures is non-empty. Contrariwise, if you say that flying monkeys don’t 
exist, you are saying of that class that it is empty.1 

If this line of thinking is correct, then existence and non-existence are not properties of individuals, just as Kant said, since they are instead properties of classes. 
A corollary is that the ontological argument does indeed fail—and does so for reasons consistent with those given by Kant. According to that argument, God must exist, since he has every perfection, including existence. But since existence is a property not of individuals but of 
classes, this argument collapses.2 

Despite all this, Kant seems to accept a version of the ontological argument. Kant holds, as we saw earlier, that beings that could fail to exist presuppose the existence of a being, namely God, that could not possibly fail to do so. In other words, God exists because it would be incoherent to suppose that he didn’t. This seems to be a version of the ontological argument, and Kant accepts this argument. 
Chapter Three Section Five On the impossibility of a cosmological proof of God’s existence 
The paradigm case of a cosmological argument is Aristotle’s ‘unmoved mover’ argument: There had to be a first event, and since this event didn’t have a cause, it was an unmoved mover and, so it is alleged to follow, must be God. In general, a cosmological argument is one to the effect that something outside, or on the edges, the totality of events causes or otherwise grounds it. 
1 See J.-M. Kuczynski Analytic Philosophy, Chapter 4. 2 See Mark Sainsbury Logical Forms. 
Kant’s position on this argument seems to be that this argument is half-right and half-wrong. It is right in that it deduces the necessary, this being God, from the contingent: “when one presupposes something existing, one can find no way around the conclusion that something exists necessarily” (575). But it is wrong in that any given cause is contingent and there cannot be a first-event: “if I assume the concept of anything I like, then I find that its existence can never be represented by me as absolutely necessary” (575). In other words, any given event is contingent and therefore isn’t the non-contingent singularity posited by the cosmological argument. 
In the very next sentence, Kant says, “That means: in going back to the conditions of existing, I can never complete the existing without assuming a necessary being, but I can never begin with this being” (575). Kant’s point here seems to be that, although the existence of contingent events does indeed show that God exists, it does not show that it was by creating some first event that God was thus responsible. 
One page later, Kant makes a similar point “you would have to assume [God] as being outside the world…[but] you can reach [God] within the world…” (576). The idea here seems to be that the cosmological argument fails since God can’t have created the world he is outside of space-time but also can’t have created it if he is in space-time. If he is in space-time, Kant says, no action on his part could have been a first event, owing to the fact that “all empirical events are derivative”, meaning that they are effects. But if God isn’t in space-time, then no action on his part could have been a first event, since a first event is ipso facto in space-time. 
Summary of Chapter Three Section Six On the impossibility of a physico­theological proof 
Kant states his position on this argument relatively clearly: “If the highest being were to stand in the chain of these conditions, then it would be a member of their series, and like the lower members of which this is presupposes, a further investigation for a still higher ground would be required for it” (578). The idea here is simply that if God were a craftsman whose activities started it all, those activities, and God himself, would simply be more contingencies, albeit unusually important ones. In other words, the teleological argument, like the cosmological arguments, turns God into another contingency. 
But one sentence later, Kant says: “If, on the contrary, one would separate [God] from this chain, and as a merely intelligible being, not include it within the series of natural causes, then what bridge can build so as to reach it” (578). The point here is that the teleological argument embodies the correct idea that a necessary being is responsible for everything else, even though it embodies an incorrect view as to the nature of this responsibility-relation. 
Kant does not clearly say how this paradox (namely, God is contingent if a cause but irrelevant if not a cause) is to be resolved. But he seems to say that the solution must lie in some kind of fusion of the teleological and ontological arguments: “Accordingly, I assert that the physico-theological proof can never establish the existence of a highest being alone, but must always leave to the ontological proof (to which it serves only as an introduction) in order to make good this lack; thus the latter contains the only possible argument (insofar as there is a merely speculative proof at all), which no human reason can bypass” (580). 
The idea here seems to be that, notwithstanding the technical problems Kant believes himself to have found in the ontological argument, there is some version of that argument— some argument of the form God is actual because possible and therefore couldn’t fail to exist— that proves that God exists and also doesn’t tether his existence to a causal relationship between himself and the world. 
Chapter Three Section Seven Critique of all theology from speculative principles of reason “Transcendental theology” is the attempt to understand God through “pure reason”, 
and “natural theology” is the attempt to understand God through his effects. 
“If by theology I understand the cognition of the original being 
[i.e. God], then it is either from pure reason (theologia rationalis) or from revelation (revelata). Now the first of these…is called transcendental theology [and the second] would have to be called natural theology” (583-584). 
In this section, Kant says that transcendental proofs of God’s existence (meaning proofs on strictly logical grounds) are consistent with deism, the doctrine that God is responsible for the world’s existence but doesn’t interact with it, and that causal proofs of his existence (meaning proofs from effects to cause, the cause being God) are consistent with theism, the doctrine that God does interact with the world: 
“Someone who admits only a transcendental theology would be called a deist; but if he also accepts a natural theology, he would be called a theist” (584). 
The idea is that whereas causal arguments presuppose that God has actual effects on existence, transcendental arguments show that God is a logical necessity, like the number three, not that (apart from creating it) he has any effects on it. 
Because natural theology “infers the properties and the existence of the world from [its] constitution”, it is divided into two branches, physico­theology, which studies mechanical events, and moral theology, which studies events involving human freedom: 
“Natural theology…ascends from this world to the highest intelligence, either as a principle of all natural or all moral order. In the first case it is called physico-theology, in the latter moral theology.” 
Kant concludes with the claim that each kind of theology has its merits and limitations, each being necessary to “correct” the other. Transcendental theology, says Kant, is needed, for the reasons earlier given, to establish God’s existence: “transcendental questions [such as whether God exists] only admit of transcendental answers, i.e. answer from pure a priori concepts, without the least empirical admixture” (587). 
At the same time, whereas transcendental theology only tells us that God exists, not what he is like, natural theology can give us information about God, given some independently arrived at proof of his existence: “Thus, [natural theology] could perhaps lend support to other proofs [of God’s existence] by connecting speculation with intuition” (587), the idea being that natural theology give empirical content (“intuition”) to the empty formalisms given us by pure thought.

Introduction 
Kant puts forth three arguments for God’s existence---or, what might be more accurate, three very different versions of a single such argument. Each is original and none has any obvious flaws. This is not to say that they prove what they are meant to prove, only that, if they fail to do so, it is not immediately clear why. 
Background: Three Argument’s for God’s Existence 
When philosophers try to prove God’s existence, it is almost always by way of one of the following three arguments: the ontological argument, the cosmological argument, and the teleological argument. 
Kant rejects each of these arguments, and his own arguments are to be understood in terms of this fact. Right now, I will state and evaluate these arguments, and then I will state and evaluate Kant’s arguments. 
The ontological argument: God is by definition perfect; failure to exist is an imperfection; therefore, God must exist. 

Analysis: This argument is a total failure, since all it shows is the truism is that if God existed, then, having as he would every conceivable perfection, he would exist— since, in other words, all it shows is that if God existed, then God would exist. 
By way of anticipation, Kant makes a similar point, albeit so clumsily and circuitously that his meaning can barely be made out. 
The cosmological argument: We can explain any given event in terms of prior events, but we cannot explain the totality of events in this way. Therefore, this event­totality can only be explained in terms of something that lies outside of itself, and any such thing, being outside of space and time and therefore thoroughly supernatural, is ipso facto God. 
Analysis: I don’t know that this argument, stated in this way, is indeed 
fallacious. 
But I do have one serious misgiving about it, namely, that anything that it outside of space and time cannot possibly create anything, since causes are necessarily in the same timeline as their effects and therefore cannot be outside of the temporal manifold. By way of anticipation, Kant makes a similar point. 
Be it noted that there are cruder versions of the cosmological argument that are either outright failures or have glaring gaps in them, a case in point being Aristotle’s ‘unmoved mover’ argument. According to Aristotle, there must be an unmoved mover at the beginning of time that sets everything else in motion. This unmoved mover, says Aristotle, must necessarily be God, given that it has the miraculous and therefore supernatural property of not needing a cause. 
The main problem with this argument is that, supposing there to be an unmoved mover at the beginning of it all, it is not clear that it would have any of the characteristics we would associate with God—not clear that it would be conscious or purposive, let alone benevolent and all-knowing. 
Maybe there is a reason why it would have these characteristics; but if so, Aristotle doesn’t say what it is, and neither does any other proponent of this argument. 
Also, if God is an unmoved mover, then unmoved movers are possible; and if they are not possible, then God cannot be one. 
The obvious counter-response is to say that they are possible only as miracles but not otherwise. But that response begs the question. 
The teleological argument: According to this argument, the structure of the world embodies intelligence and is therefore the work of an intelligent craftsman, this being God, since any craftsman capable of creating the universe would seem for that very reason to qualify as God. 
There is also the fact that not only does the structure of the world suggest intelligence; the world actually contains intelligence—as in, we are intelligent, and so to varying degrees are other creatures. And it is very hard to see how intelligence could come from unthinking matter. 
Leibniz put forth this argument, and it occurs as a subsidiary argument in one of Kant’s argument’s for God’s existence. Whether it is a version of the teleological argument is a question we can set aside for now. 
Analysis: This argument is prima facie reasonable, but Kant himself identifies a subtle problem with it. See below. 
Kant’s criticisms of these three arguments 
Kant’s analysis of the ontological argument is that it involves some kind of sophism stemming from a failure to see that, even though, linguistically, “exists” and other such terms are comparable to “runs” and “is red” and other garden-variety predicates, nonetheless “exists” has very different logical properties from other predicates. Kant is right that there is a muddle at work here, but he does not do a good job of putting his finger on the problem. 
In any case, the blunder is that “red” and “runs” and other garden-variety predicates attribute properties to objects, whereas “exists” attributes a property to a concept. When you say that a pink elephant exists, you are not first picking out some existent pink elephant and then uselessly attributing existence to it; rather, you are saying of the concept of a pink elephant that it is instantiated (or, equivalently, of the class of pink 
elephants that it is non-empty).1 

Kant’s analysis of the ontological argument is not very important, either in itself or to the architectonic of his thought; but his analyses of the other two arguments are important. 
His basic criticism of both arguments is that they fail to distinguish between cause and ground. Both of these arguments, according to Kant, are to the effect that God is a cause of the universe. But, says Kant, if that is true, then God is just one cause among many---and therefore isn’t very God-like. 
1 Kant’s criticisms of the ontological argument are stated in the first three “reflections” contained in The Only Possible Proof of God’s Existence and also in pages 563-568 of the Critique of Pure Reason (Guyer Translation). 

The idea here is that, if God is simply a super-cause, then he differs only in degree, not in nature, from other causes and for that reason isn’t really God. 
Kant’s position is that God, if existent, must be the rational basis of the universe, not its creator—not, in other words, just another cause, albeit a particularly important one. 
Relatedly, Kant holds that these two arguments attempt to establish God’s existence in much the way that a scientific hypothesis attempts to establish the existence of some unseen force or particle. I see footprints; I start thinking like a scientist and decide to model this data by positing the existence of another person on the island. Similarly, so the teleological argument goes, we see order and intelligence, and the natural explanation is that there is an intelligent designer behind it all. 
According to Kant, this is not a bad argument per se, but it is a bad argument for God; it is a good argument for a very important—but less than God-like—being of some kind or other. 
Give or take a few niceties, Kant holds much the same to be true of the cosmological argument. He holds that, if it weren’t through, it would only establish the existence of a super-cause—one cause among others, albeit an unusually important one—and would therefore fail to establish God’s existence, since God, so Kant holds, must be more than just another 
cause.2 

2 This argument is given in the fourth “reflection” contained in The Only Possible Proof of God’s Existence and also in pages 570-582 of the Critique of Pure Reason (Guyer Translation). 
Ground vs. Cause: Kant’s reason for rejecting constructive proofs of God’s existence 
Kant says that any attempt to produce “speculative” or “theoretical” proofs of God’s existence must necessarily fail. By this he means that God’s existence is not to be proved scientifically but rather conceptually. Science identifies causes. Science tells us that we came from apes and that glass comes from heated sand and the like. God, says Kant, is what underlies the very possibility of such explanations and is therefore not himself to be explained in this way. 
Here is one way to think of it. You and a friend are watching a play about three people, Smith, Jones, and Brown. You find the play confusing. “Why did Smith just punch Brown”, you ask your friend. Your friend explains that Brown just insulted Smith. “Why did Jones take Brown’s side”, you then ask your friend. “Because Jones is mad at Smith for stealing his car.” All of these explanations are play-internal. They concern character-to-character causal relations. 
Now suppose you ask: “why does the play itself exist?” The mechanisms in terms of which you explain the behavior of the characters can’t explain why the play itself exists. If you were to say “because there is a fourth character, Green, who created the others and set them in motion”, your answer would be misconceived. The author of the play is not just another character. In fact, he is not another character at all. And although he is responsible for the existence of the play, the way in which he is responsible for it is very different from the way in which Brown’s insult leads to Smith’s punch. The author is what makes all of the character-on­character causal relations possible, and it therefore was not through such relations that the author was responsible for the play’s existence. 
In my view, Kant is quite right about this. The cosmological and teleological arguments, even if cogent, simply establish the existence of a relatively God-like being that isn’t God—a being that differs from other causes only in degree and is therefore just another character in the play of existence. 
Kant’s first argument for God’s existence: God’s existence as the foundation of causal explanation 
This brings us to Kant’s own arguments for God’s existence. 
The first is in Section 1, Reflection 4 of his monograph The Only Possible Proof of God’s Existence. Here is a summary: 
Things that exist contingently presuppose the existence of something that exists necessarily. 
I exist contingently, and so do you. But the basis of our existence is not itself contingent. It is not a contingent fact that we could exist, even though it is a contingent fact that this possibility was actualized. 
Whatever it is that makes our existence possible, that being must have (or be) a mind, since non-mental existence does not by itself make mental existence possible. 
Moreover, there can only be one being that exists necessarily. This is because necessary beings are ones that are necessary for contingent beings; and if each of two or more beings were responsible the existence of contingent beings, then all but one of those necessary beings would be redundant, meaning that they were not in fact necessary. 
Finally, being simple, this necessary being cannot be destroyed, since to be destroyed is to be decomposed into parts. 
Any being having all of these characteristics is obviously God, since God is an indestructible being that is responsible for existence and, specifically, for spiritual existence. Q.E.D. 
Kant’s second argument for God’s existence: Natural orderliness as being grounded in the coherence of God’s mind 
Kant’s second argument for God’s existence is in Section 2 of the same work. 
Here is a summary: 
It is not the orderliness of nature that proves God’s existence but is rather the unity of nature that does so. A clock is orderly, but it is a blind kind of order and depends on causes and effects happening to line up in a certain way: if a certain gear isn’t oiled or a certain screw falls out, the mechanism collapses. The orderliness that we find in nature is a mere sign of an underlying coherence that, although expressed in mechanical interactions, is distinct from them. 
The sort of orderliness we find in a clock is mere evidence of coherence; it is merely the causal fallout of the activities of a coherent mind and is not itself coherence. But the orderliness that we find in nature is itself coherence. Proof of this, says Kant, is that, in nature, disruptive events simply lead to new forms of order, whereas, in mere mimicries of nature, such as clocks, such disruptions simply ramify. 
Orderliness is a purely mechanical property, being a property of non-sentient beings. But coherence is a psychological property, being a property of minds. And since the universe is not merely orderly but also coherent, it is itself a mind, or the embodiment thereof, and, given a few extra premises similar to those involved in the previously given argument, it follows that this mind must itself be God. 
Kant’s third argument for God’s existence: morality as grounded in the coherence of God’s mind3 

This argument is to the effect that the existence of morality presupposes the existence of God. Here is a summary: 
It is a datum that we have moral obligations. Moral obligations obviously couldn’t possibly be created in the way that boats or hammers could be created. At the same time, moral obligations must be grounded in something other than themselves, given that they are obviously not brute, random facts. 
According to Kant, there are two ‘categorical imperatives’, 
i.e. two moral directives that must be followed no matter what. 
First, people should treat others as subjects, not objects; in other words, people should not use other people. (I am violating this principle if I enslave someone and complying with it if I engage in fair business dealings with them.) 
Second, one’s conduct should be guided by principles that one could coherently want everybody’s conduct to be guided by. (I am violating this principle if I tell a lie, since lies wouldn’t work in a world of liars; and for the same reason mutatis mutandis, I am complying with this principle if I tell the truth.) 
3 This argument is given in the Critique of Pure Reason (Guyer Translation), pages 582-589. 

Kant believes these principles to be equivalent. Kant seems to hold that, when people violate the second categorical imperative, they introduce an incoherence into the universe similar to the incoherence they introduce into individual people’s when they violate the first categorical imperative. The idea being that morality is grounded in the universe’s being coherent---as opposed to merely ‘orderly’---and in its therefore being (or embodying) the mind of a deity. 
Kant is in fact wrong to regard those two principles as equivalent, given that one can perform moral acts that are driven by principles that one could not coherently want all human conduct to be driven by. (For example, when Beethoven composed innovative music, he was behaving ethically, but the principle guiding his conduct—namely, upset existing norms—obviously isn’t one that one could coherently want all conduct to be guided by.) But what is relevant in this context is that Kant regarded morality as being rooted in the coherence of a deity’s mind, immoral conduct being conduct that undermines this coherence. 
Kant’s arguments for God as transcendental arguments 
Kant invented an entirely new kind of argument—the so-called “transcendental argument.” A transcendental argument is one to the effect that, unless such and such existed, it could not even be asked whether such and such existed. If somebody asks me to prove that there exist minds that think coherently, I can respond by saying that, unless such minds existed, that very question couldn’t even be understood or therefore asked. 
Transcendental arguments prove the existence not of causes but rather of grounds.A cause is what makes something exist. A ground is what makes it possible for something to exist. Kant’s argument’s for God’s existence are to the effect that God’s existence makes it possible for there to be morality and natural law, and those arguments are therefore transcendental in nature. For the reasons already given, Kant’s position is that any argument for the existence of a bona fide God, as opposed to a God-like super-cause that is not in fact God, must be transcendental. 

Kant Quotations 
All of the following passages are from V. THE EXISTENCE OF GOD AS A POSTULATE OF PURE PRACTICAL REASON in Practical Philosophy. 
“We ought to strive to promote the highest good (which must therefore be possible). Accordingly, the existence of a cause of all nature, distinct from nature, which contains the ground of this connection, namely of the exact correspondence of happiness with morality, is also postulated.” 
Kant, Immanuel. Practical Philosophy (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant) (p. 240). Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition. 
Question 1: Is the basic meaning of this passage that, thanks to God’s existence, what we should do ultimately converges with what we want to do? 
“The supreme cause of nature, insofar as it must be presupposed for the highest good, is a being that is the cause of nature by understanding and will (hence its author), that is, God.” 
Kant, Immanuel. Practical Philosophy (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant) (pp. 240-241). Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition. 

Question 2: Does this passage presuppose that, unless the universal is itself rational, human rational is pointless and therefore, as it were, ‘irrational’? 
“The Epicureans had indeed assumed an altogether false principle of morals as supreme, namely that of happiness, and had substituted for a law a maxim of each choosing as he pleased according to his inclination; they proceeded, however, consistently enough in this by demeaning their highest good in the same way, namely in proportion to the meanness of their principle, and expecting no greater happiness than can be acquired by human prudence (including temperance and moderation of the inclinations).” 
Kant, Immanuel. Practical Philosophy (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant) (p. 242). Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition. 
Question 3: Kant seems to be saying that the Epicurean system overvalued happiness and undervalued virtue. But he also seems to be saying that, because of the specific way they advocating trying to achieve happiness, their system in effect demands virtue of its followers. Is this the reading of this passage? And, if so, is it possible that Kant was misreading the Epicureans? More precisely, isn’t possible that the Epicureans 

advocated the pursuit of happiness because they that thought that properly pursuing happiness would conduce to virtue? 
“The Stoics, on the contrary, had chosen their supreme practical principle quite correctly, namely virtue, as the condition of the highest good; but inasmuch as they represented the degree of virtue required by its pure law as fully attainable in this life, they not only strained the moral capacity of the human being, under the name of a sage, far beyond all the limits of his nature.” 

Question 4: Is Kant saying that stoicism failed to make adequate concessions to our need for gratification and happiness? 
The doctrine of Christianity, even if it is not regarded as a religious doctrine, gives on this point a concept of the highest good (of the kingdom of God) which alone satisfies the strictest demand of practical reason.[5:128] The moral law is holy (inflexible) and demands holiness of morals, although all the moral perfection that a human being can attain is still only virtue, that is, a disposition conformed with law from respect for law, and thus consciousness of a continuing propensity to transgression or at least impurity, that is, an admixture of many spurious (not moral) motives to observe the law, hence a self-esteem combined with humility; and so, with respect to the holiness that the Christian law demands, nothing remains for a creature but endless progress, though for that very reason he is justified in hoping for his endless duration. 
Kant, Immanuel. Practical Philosophy (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant) (pp. 242-243). Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition. 
Question 5: It sounds as though what Kant is referring to as “the doctrine of Christianity” is similar to his own doctrine, in that advocates virtue with the qualification that, in due course, virtue leads to happiness. If so, how is “the doctrine of Christianity” that different from Kant’s moral doctrine? 
Question 6 (not specific to any one passage): Kant very clearly seems to 
believe the existence of a rational Supreme Being to be a prerequisite for the existence of moral obligation. He also seems to believe that this being’s rationality must be etched into the very structure of the world. What I don’t quite understand is why, in Kant’s view, God is necessary for morality. Kant’s ‘categorical imperative’ is that we must treat others as subjects, not as objects; which is certainly true and which may well e the supreme moral imperative—but the validity of which doesn’t in any obvious way presuppose God’s existence. How would Kant respond to this? 


Kant Questions 
What exactly does Kant conceive God to be? He seems to reject the usual view that God is a kind of super-human (a mere ‘highest architect of the world’, CPR, 581) on the grounds that this would be beneath him, and he even seems to go so far as to say that God is to be thought of not as a causal agent but as a ‘transcendental precondition’ for spatiotemporal existence. But how can a ‘transcendental precondition’ bear any resemblance to anything that could be described as ‘God’? 
Kant seems to say that causality is a property of phenomena, not of noumena, but he also seems to hold, or implicitly assume, that noumena (including God and human souls) interact with phenomena. How are these positions to be reconciled, given that, if the phenomenal and noumenal interact, then causality is not specific to the phenomenal realm? 
Does Kant hold that God’s existence is a precondition for the existence of thought itself? If so, what exactly is his reasoning? 
Does Kant hold that God’s existence is a precondition for the existence of morality? If so, what exactly is his reasoning? 
In the Monadology, Leibniz seems to allege that what we believe to be causal connections are really due to some kind of God-based ‘pre­established harmony.’ Does Kant have a similar view? After all, Kant holds that causality is a property of the ‘phenomenal’ world (the world as it appears), not of the ‘noumenal’ world (the world as it is in and of itself), and he also seems to hold that God, whatever exactly he is, belongs to the ‘noumenal’ world. 
In Kant’s view, is causality a property of the ‘phenomenal’ reality but not of ‘noumenal’ reality? If so, how can God, being a ‘noumenon’ and therefore devoid of causal properties, interact with the world? And what about the mind (or soul): how can it, being a noumenon, do anything, in Kant’s view? 
If noumena have no causal properties, then how can they guide the corresponding phenomena? 
Kant holds that what is contingent depends for its existence on what is necessary and also that there can be only one necessary being. Having established these two points (or so let us assume), he then says that this necessary being has a mind: what is his defense of the last point? 
In Kant’s view, is God embodied? Or is he pure mind? 
Kant seems to believe that there are two kinds of reasoning: “empirical”, this being inferences to causes, and “transcendental”, this being inferences to rational preconditions. In Kant’s view, are transcendental arguments always for the existence of noumena as opposed to phenomena? 
Is it fair to say that, in Kant’s view, God is responsible for the world’s existence in the sense that he is a logical precondition for it, as opposed to a cause of it? 
In Kant’s view, does God causally interact with the world? If so, how does Kant reconcile this with (what very much appears to be) his belief that God’s relation to the world is that of necessary precondition, as opposed to vera causa? 
Kant holds that God has a mind (or is a mind). This presumably means that God has thoughts, makes decisions, and the like. But how is this possible if, as Kant seems to hold, God’s relation to the world is not that he is its creator but rather its rational basis? How can a ‘rational basis’ have thoughts or feelings or other psychological properties? 
According to Spinoza, so far as I understand him, God doesn’t think or indeed do much of anything. What I don’t understand is how Kant’s view is any different. Kant does indeed attribute a mind to God. But he also seems to deny that God interacts with the world, it being an abridgment of God’s greatness for him to do so. How is Kant’s conception of God (God is ground, not cause, of reality) different from Spinoza’s (God is reality itself, not some creator of it that is distinct from it)?

Key Concepts and Definitions 
Contingent: Not necessary. I am contingent, and so you are you, 
since the universe could obviously exist (and in pretty much its current 
condition) without either of us. 
A posteriori knowledge: A posteriori knowledge is observation-based. My knowledge that a dog us running towards me is a posteriori. A posteriori knowledge is knowledge that is not a priori. 
A priori knowledge: Knowledge rooted in our very ability to think. A 
priori knowledge is not derived from experience. The knowledge embodied in my ability to have observations, and to derive knowledge from them, is a priori. 
A prerequisite for my having a perception of a dog is my being able to have perceptions that represent objects as having various spatial and temporal relations to one another, and such knowledge, being prior to observation, is a priori. 
Key point: According to Kant, some proofs of God are a priori, and some are a posteriori. The ontological argument is a priori; the cosmological and teleological arguments are a posteriori. 
Ontological argument: God has every perfection; and 
since existence is a perfection, God has it. Commentary: 
This argument is a priori, since it is based on pure 
reason. 
Kant’s criticism of the ontological argument: It cannot coherently be said of a given object that it has or lacks ‘existence.’ We can say that flying monkeys exist, since in doing so we are saying of some class that it is non-empty (or of two non-empty classes that they intersect); but it cannot meaningfully be said of a given flying monkey that it exists (since that is presupposed), or that it doesn’t (same reason). 
Cosmological argument: For there to events that are otherwise governed by natural law, there had to be an event (or condition) not so governed. 
Commentary: This argument is a posteriori, since it is based on our empirical knowledge that there are events governed by laws. 
Additional commentary: Even atheists who believe in the Big Bang grant that this event was a ‘singularity’ and therefore not governed by natural law. 
Kant’s criticism of the cosmological argument: 
Teleological Argument (Argument from Design): The world is orderly and (seemingly) intelligent, suggesting the existence of a grand architect. 
Commentary: This argument is a posteriori, since it is based on our knowledge of the fact that the world is orderly, coupled with our knowledge of the fact that order is often the handiwork of an intelligent being. 
Physico-theological argument: Kant’s term for ‘teleological argument.’ 
Empirical argument: Observation-based argument, e.g. I know that Smith isn’t violent unless he drinks, and I conclude that he must have been drunk when he punched Jones. 
Transcendental argument: Argument based solely on considerations of what is presupposed by the very existence of thinking beings, e.g. ‘I know that the universe must to some degree be law-governed, since I wouldn’t even exist to question the lawfulness of the universe in a complete anarchical one.’ 
Deism: The belief that God, though responsible for the universe, doesn’t interact with it. Commentary: If deism is right, God presumably has an impersonal character. 
Theism: The belief that God, in addition to being responsible for the universe, interacts with it. Commentary: If theism is right, God presumably is ‘hands-on’ and personal. 
Natural theology: The discipline that tries to understand God by studying empirical facts. Commentary: According to Kant, natural theology presupposes theism. 
Transcendental theology: The discipline that tries to understand God on the basis of pure reason. Commentary: According to Kant, transcendental theology presupposes deism. 
Key Kant Quotations 
“If something, no matter what, exists, then it must also be conceded that something exists necessarily” (560). Significance: Supposedly proves that God exists. 
“One sees things alter, arise, and perish; therefore…they must have a cause…Now where could we more appropriately locate the supreme causality than right where the highest causality is, i.e. in that being originally containing within itself what is sufficient for the possible effect, whose concept also comes about very easily through the single trait of an all-encompassing perfection” (562). 
Significance: Same as last quotation. Note that this passage has a Platonic quality: the ephemeral presupposes the permanent. 
“For the contingent exists only under the condition of something else as its cause, and from this the same inference holds further all the way to a cause not existing contingently and therefore necessarily without condition” (560). 
Significance: The kernel of truth in the cosmological argument. 
“[A] being that contains all reality, hence all conditions, [is] absolutely unconditioned and [is therefore] a thing which is suited for absolute necessity” (562). 
Significance: Says what God is. He constitutes it, as opposed to 
creating it. Similar to Spinoza’s view. (See below.) 
“All paths on which may set forth with this aim either begin from determinate experiences and the special constitution of our world of sense known through it, and ascend from that by means of laws of causality to the highest cause outside the world; or else they…abstract from all experience and infer the existence of a highest cause entirely a priori from mere concepts” (561). 
Significance: All knowledge is either a priori or a posteriori, and we have both a priori and a posteriori knowledge of God. God’s existence is known a priori; God’s nature is known a posteriori. 
Key Non-Kant Quotations 
[A]ll this detail only involves other contingents, anterior or more detailed, each one of which needs a like analysis for its explanation, we 
make no advance, and the sufficient or final reason must be outside of the sequence or series of this detail of contingencies, however infinite it may be. And thus it is that the final reason of things must be found in a necessary substance, in which the detail of changes exists only eminently, as in their source, and this it is which we call GOD. 
Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm. The philosophical works of Leibnitz (Kindle Locations 3425-3427). New Haven : Tuttle, Morehouse & Taylor. Kindle Edition. 
Significance: Similar to a version of the cosmological argument that 
Kant half-accepts. 
[F]rom God’s supreme power, or infinite nature, an infinite number of things—that is, all things have necessarily flowed forth in an infinite number of ways, or always follow from the same necessity; in the same way as from the nature of a triangle it follows from eternity and for eternity, that its three interior angles are equal to two right angles. Wherefore the omnipotence of God has been displayed from all eternity, and will for all eternity remain in the same state of activity. 
Spinoza, Benedict de . The Works of Benedict de Spinoza: The Ethics, On The Improvement Of The Understanding, A Political Treatise, A Theologico-Political Treatise and More (5 Books With Active Table of Contents) (Kindle Locations 11312-11316). Kindle Edition. 
Significance: Similar to Kant’s view that God is the ground, as opposed to cause, of reality. 
“The most perfect Being has all perfections; existence is a perfection; therefore, the most perfect being exists” becomes: “There is one and only one entity x which is most perfect; that one has all perfections; therefore that one exists.” As a proof this fails for want of a proof that of the premise “there is one and only one entity x which is most perfect. 
Bertrand Russell On Denoting 
Introduction to Presentation Proper 
What follows is an analytic summary of Chapter Three, Sections Three to Seven (pp. 559-589) of the Critique of Pure Reason (Guyer Translation). In this material, Kant evaluates what he claims to be the only three possible ‘speculative’ methods of proving God’s existence. 
The reading is divided into several sections. I will summarize each section, anchoring my summary in illustrative quotations. I will then briefly discuss the merits and demerits of that section. 
Kant does not in this context put forth his own views as to how to prove God’s existence, only how, in his view, God’s existence is not to be proved. Kant’s views as to how God’s existence is to be proved, and also as to how he conceives of God, sometimes emerge but are never directly argued for---mainly, I suspect, because he was still working them out. 
This reading is divided into the following sections: 
Chapter Three Section Three: The grounds of proof of speculative 
reason for inferring the existence of a highest being Chapter Three 
Section Four On an impossibility of an ontological proof of God’s 
existence 
Chapter Three Section Five On the impossibility of a 
cosmological proof of God’s existence Chapter Three 
Section Six On the impossibility of a physico­
theological proof 
Chapter Three Section Seven Critique of all theology from speculative 
principles of reason 
Chapter Three Section Four contains an important subsection, “There are only three kinds of proof for the existence of God possible from speculative reason”, to which I will dedicate a section of its own. 
Right now I will briefly summarize the material, and I will 
then proceed to the section-by-section summary. Summary of 
this presentation 
In this reading, Kant discusses three arguments for God’s existence: the ontological, the cosmological, and the teleological. Kant uses the term ‘physico-theological’ instead of ‘teleological.’ 
The essence of the ontological argument is that God cannot fail to exist since God has every perfection and existence is a perfection. 
Kant’s discussion of the ontological argument is long and technical, but the gist of it is that he believes it to embody a muddle similar to that involved in someone’s believing that, since the Average American has 1.3 children, there must be some specific individual who has 1.3 children. 
Kant’s attitude towards the Ontological argument is curiously ambivalent. He spends pages and pages arguing that it is spurious, but he also appears to accept a version of it, as we will discuss. 
The essence of the cosmological argument is that, whereas events within the universe have universe-internal causes, the cause or basis of the universe itself cannot possibly be universe-internal and, so it is alleged to follow, must therefore be God. 
The gist of Kant’s assessment of this argument is that, were it cogent, it would simply turn God into another cause, albeit an unusually important one, and that God is appropriately thought of not as the cause of the universe but as its ground. 
The essence of the teleological argument is that, given how intricately and—by all appearances—intelligently structured it is, the universe must be the work of a sapient being. 
The gist of Kant’s assessment of this argument is that, were it cogent, this argument would establish the existence of a great craftsman whose lot it was to arrange pre-existing materials in accordance with pre­existing laws and who, for that reason, could not possibly be God, since God, according to Kant, is responsible not just for the way the materials are arranged, but also for those materials themselves, along with the laws governing their assembly. 
A theme that recurs throughout this reading is that the arguments traditionally given for God’s existence fail to do him justice, in that they turn him into a mere cause of existence, as opposed to a ground or justification for it, and thereby give his relationship to reality a fortuitous character. 
Another theme is that both “transcendental” (strictly logical) and “natural” (observation-based) methods of thinking about God complement each other, with the former providing rigorous proofs of his existence, but telling us little about what he is like, and the latter telling us what he is like, but failing to prove his existence. 
Summary of Chapter Three Section Three “The grounds of proof of speculative reason for inferring the existence of a highest being” 
Things that exist contingently (i.e. accidentally) do so only thanks to 
something that exists necessarily: 
(1) “If something, no matter what, exists, then it must also be conceded that something exists necessarily” (560). 
Kant then attempts to prove this principle: 
(2) 
“For the contingent exists only under the condition of something else as its cause, and from this the same inference holds further all the way to a cause not existing contingently and therefore necessarily without condition” (560). 

(2) 
really just restates (1) and is therefore question-begging and devoid of force. But (2) is really just a misconceived way of expressing a line of reasoning that, unlike (2), does have force, namely: 

(3) 
Let X be some contingent being. X’s existence is a mere accident, but the possibility of X’s existence cannot possibly be a mere accident. It is an accident which possibilities are actualized, but not which possibilities exist to be actualized. Therefore, the basis of the possibility of X’s existing lies in something that, unlike X itself, exists necessarily. 


on. 
(3) 
is a line of reasoning that comes up again and again in Kant’s work. In what remains of this section, Kant very obscurely touches on some ideas that he discusses more thoroughly later First, he mentions the Ontological argument: 

(4) 
“[Once] reason takes it as already settled that something or other exists with absolute necessity, [it then tries to] derive it from its concept alone” (560) 


In other words, once people realize that there exists a necessary being, they are tempted to show that the very concept of that being entails its own existence. Put more simply, 
(5) God does exist because he could exist, 
this being the essence of the Ontological argument. 
Elsewhere, Kant rejects the Ontological argument. But in this particular context, he seems, possibly unwittingly, to be accepting a version of it. 
Kant also cryptically but pregnantly says that “the unity of reality is… the basis of possibility” (561). It is not clear what he means by this, but it obviously ties into a proof that he gives elsewhere of the existence of God, 
namely: 
(6) Nature is not merely orderly but also unified, i.e. coherent, which bespeaks the existence of a higher sapient being. 
Kant also vaguely seems to put forth an argument to the effect that 
there can be only one God: 
(7) “[A] being that contains all reality, hence all conditions, [is] absolutely unconditioned and [is therefore] a thing which is suited for absolute necessity” (562). 
This argument seems to be to the following effect: 
(8) Anything capable of being God must “contain all of reality”, 
i.e. not only be solely responsible for all of reality but also constitute it. Given that there obviously can exist at most one such being, there can only be one God. 
One of the conceits embodied in this argument is that God is to be thought of not as the cause of reality but as its ground, the idea being that, if God were a mere cause, he would ultimately be just another run-of-the­mill occupant of space-time, whereas he is more than this if he is its ground. 
On page 562, Kant puts forth an extremely obscure argument that seems to concern some kind of link between our moral obligations and God’s existence: 
(9) 
“For suppose there were obligations that were entirely correct in the idea of reason but would have no real application to us, i.e. would be without any incentives, if a highest being were not presupposed, who could give effect and emphasis to the practical laws; then we would also have an obligation to follow those concepts, that even though they may not be objectively sufficient, are still preponderant in accordance with the measure of our reason, and in comparison with which we recognize nothing better or more convincing” (562). 

(10) 
there are certain rules that we simply have to follow, even though following them does not in and of itself do us any good; but thanks to God’s existence, we have some kind of practical reason to follow these rules. 


The key idea here seems to be this: 
Obviously, (10) is a weak (or enthymematic) argument, but it is very hard to find any other meaning in (9); and there is evidence in other parts of Kant that he thought along these lines. 
In the last paragraph of this section, Kant brings together some of the 
just-discussed points: 
(11) “One sees things alter, arise, and perish; therefore…they must have a cause…Now where could we more appropriately locate the supreme causality than right where the highest causality is, i.e. in that being originally containing within itself what is sufficient for the possible effect, whose concept also comes about very easily through the single trait of an all-encompassing perfection” (562). 
The idea here seems to be that God exists unconditionally and is 
himself the condition for everything else’s existence. Summary of 
There are only three kinds of proof for the existence of God possible 
from speculative reason 
The main point of this subsection is that there are indeed that only thee creditable proofs of God’s existence that are based on ‘speculative reason’, these being the ontological, cosmological, and teleological arguments. The first sentence in this section gives us some information as to what Kant means by this and why he regards it as true: 
(*) “All paths on which may set forth with this aim either begin from determinate experiences and the special constitution of our world of sense known through it, and ascend from that by means of laws of causality to the highest cause outside the world; or else they are empirically grounded on an experience that is only indeterminate, i.e. on some existence; or, finally, they abstract from all experience and infer the existence of a highest cause entirely a priori from mere concepts” (561). 
The first kind of reasoning is garden-variety inference to the best­
explanation. An example: I see footprints in the sand and on that basis 
realizing that there is another person on the island. Kant says that the teleological argument is an example of this kind of reasoning: “The first proof is physico-theological.” 
The second kind also seems to be inference to the best explanation, with the qualification that the fact being explained is an existential generalization, i.e. a statement of the form ‘something has property phi.’ An example: Even though I personally cannot identify a single specific person who suffers from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, I also know that the number of high schoolers with this condition has tripled in the last two years, and on that basis I realize that many high schools must have lifted their ban on football and other contact sports. 
Kant says that the cosmological argument is an example of this kind of reasoning: “[T]he second [proof is]…cosmological.” 
What is unclear to me is why, in Kant’s view, the teleological argument and cosmological arguments are instances of two different kinds of explanation. Obviously, they are not the same explanation, but they both see to be inferences to the best explanation; and neither seems any more or less dependent than the other on premises that are existence-claims. 
The third kind is purely conceptual. An example: A proof that there 
exists a unique even prime. 
Kant says, obviously correctly, that that the ontological argument is an example of this kind of reasoning: “[T]he third [proof is]… cosmological.” That is to say, the ontological argument is meant to be a purely conceptual, as opposed to empirical, proof. 
In the second paragraph of this two-paragraph section, Kant says that: “…reason accomplishes just as little on the one path (the empirical)_ as on the other (the transcendental) and that it spreads its wings in vain when seeking to rise above the world through the mere might of speculation.” 
I find this puzzling since Kant himself, in his paper “the only possible proof of God’s existence”, gives transcendental arguments for God’s existence. 
Chapter Three Section Four On an impossibility of an ontological 
proof of God’s existence 
The point of this section is that the ontological argument involves some kind of failure to understand the logical properties of attributions of existence. 
Kant seems to say that, given some specific object X, it makes little sense to attribute existence to X, since X’s existence is indeed assumed, and, for that reason, absolutely no sense to deny its existence. 
(*) “I ask you: Is the proposition This or that thing…exists---is this proposition, I say, an analytic or a synthetic proposition? If it is the former, then with existence you add nothing to your thought of the thing…If you concede, on the contrary, as in all fairness you must, that every existential proposition is synthetic, then how would you assert that the predicate of existence may not be cancelled without contradiction?” (566) 
The question arises: under what circumstances are attributions and 
denial of existence meaningful? 
The contemporary answer is that existence-claims concern classes. If you say that flying monkeys exist, you are saying that the class of such creates is non-empty. Contrariwise, if you say that flying monkeys don’t exist, you are saying of that class that it is empty.1 

If this line of thinking is correct, then existence and non-existence are not properties of individuals, just as Kant said, since they are instead properties of class. 
A corollary is that the ontological argument does indeed fail—and does so for reasons consistent with those given by Kant. According to that argument, God must exist, since he has every perfection, including existence. But since existence is a property not of individuals but of classes, this argument collapses. 
Despite all this, Kant seems to accept a version of the ontological argument. Kant holds, as saw earlier, that beings that could fail to exist presuppose the existence of a being, namely God, that could not possibly fail to do so. In other words, God exists because it would be incoherent to suppose that he didn’t. This seems to be a version of the ontological argument, and Kant accepts this argument. 
Chapter Three Section Five On the impossibility of a cosmological proof of God’s existence 
The paradigm case of a cosmological argument is Aristotle’s 
‘unmoved mover’ argument: There had to be a first event, and since this event didn’t have a cause, it was an unmoved mover and, so it is alleged to follow, must be God. In general, a cosmological argument is one to the effect that something outside, or on the edges, the totality of events causes it or otherwise grounds it. 
Kant’s position on this argument seems to be that this argument is half-right and half-wrong. It is right in that it deduces the necessary, this being God, from the contingent: “when one presupposes something existing, one can find no way around the 
1 See J.-M. Kuczynski Analytic Philosophy, Chapter 4. 
conclusion that something exists necessarily” (575). But it is wrong in that any given cause is contingent and there cannot be a first-event: “if I assume the concept of anything I like, then I find that its existence can never be represented by me as absolutely necessary” (575). In other words, any given is contingent and therefore isn’t the non-contingent singularity posited by the cosmological argument. 
In the very next sentence, Kant says, “That means: in going back to the conditions of existing, I can never complete the existing without assuming a necessary being, but I can never begin with this being” (575). Kant’s point here seems to be that, although the existence of contingent events does indeed show that God exists, it does not show that it was by creating some first event that God is thus responsible. 
One page later, Kant makes a similar point “you would have to assume [God] as being outside the world…[but] you can reach [God] within the world…” (576). The idea here seems to be that the cosmological argument fails since God can’t have created the world he is outside of space-time but also can’t have created it if he is in space-time. If he is in space-time, Kant says, no action on his part could have been a first event, owing to the fact that “all empirical events are derivative”, meaning that they are effects. But if God isn’t in space-time, then no action on his part could have been a first event, since a first event is ipso facto in space-time. 
Summary of Chapter Three Section Six On the impossibility of a 
physico-theological proof 
Kant states his position on this argument relatively clearly: “If the highest being were to stand in the chain of these conditions, then it would be a member of their series, and like the lower members of which this is presupposes, a further investigation for a still higher ground would be required for it” (578). The idea here is simply that if God were a craftsman whose activities started it all, those activities, and God himself, would simply be more contingencies, albeit unusually important ones. In other words, the teleological argument, like the cosmological arguments, turns God into another contingency. 
But one sentence later, Kant says: “If, on the contrary, one would separate [God] from this chain, and as a merely intelligible being, not include it within the series of natural causes, then what bridge can build so as to reach it” (578). The point here is that the teleological argument embodies the correct idea that a necessary being is responsible for everything else, even though it embodies an incorrect view as to the nature of this responsibility-relation. 
Kant does not clearly say how this paradox (namely, God is contingent if a cause but irrelevant if not a cause) is to be resolved. But he seems to say that the solution must lie in some kind of fusion of the teleological and ontological arguments: “Accordingly, I assert that the physico-theological proof can never establish the existence of a highest being alone, but must always leave to the ontological proof (to which it serves only as an introduction) in order to make good this lack; thus the latter contains the only possible argument (insofar as there is a merely speculative proof at all), which no human reason can bypass” (580). 
The idea here seems to be that, notwithstanding the technical problems Kant believes himself to have found in the ontological argument, there is some version of that argument—some argument of the form God is actual because possible and therefore couldn’t fail to exist—that proves that God exists and also doesn’t tether his existence to a causal relationship between himself and the world. 
Chapter Three Section Seven Critique of all theology from speculative principles of reason 
“Transcendental theology” is the attempt to understand God through “pure reason”, and “natural theology” is the attempt to understand God through his effects. 
“If by theology I understand the cognition of the original being [i.e. God], then it is either from pure reason (theologia rationalis) or from revelation (revelata). Now the first of these…is called transcendental theology [and the second] would hae to be called natural theology” (583­584). 
In this section, Kant says that transcendental proofs of God’s existence (meaning proofs on strictly logical grounds) are consistent with deism, the doctrine that God is responsible for the world’s existence but doesn’t interact with it, and that causal proofs of his existence (meaning proofs from effects to cause, the cause being God) are consistent with theism, the doctrine that God does interact with the world: 
“Someone who admits only a transcendental theology would be a called a deist; but if he also accepts a natural theology, he would be called a theist” (584). 
The idea is that whereas causal arguments presuppose that God has actual effects on existence, transcendental arguments show that God is a logical necessity, like the number three, not that, over and above his being responsible for the world, has any effects on it. 
Because natural theology “infers the properties and the existence of the world from [its] constitution”, it is divided into two branches, physico­theology, which studies mechanical events, and moral theology, which studies events involving human freedom: 
“Natural theology…ascends from this world to the highest intelligence, either as a principle of all natural or all moral order. In the first case it is called physico-theology, in the latter moral theology.” 
Kant concludes with the claim that each kind of theology has its merits and limitations, each being necessary to “correct” the other. Transcendental theology, says Kant, is needed, for the reasons earlier given, to establish God’s existence: “transcendental questions [such as whether God exists] only admit of transcendental answers, i.e. answer from pure a priori concepts, without the least empirical admixture” (587). 
At the same time, whereas transcendental theology only tells us that God exists, not what he is like, natural theology can give us information about God, given some independently arrived at proof of his existence: “Thus, [natural theology] could perhaps lend support to other proofs [of God’s existence] by connecting speculation with intuition” (587), the idea being that natural theology give empirical content (“intuition”) to the empty formalisms given us by pure thought. 
What does Kant believe God to be? 

My Research Question 
My research question is: What kind of being does Kant believe God to be? My answer is that Kant accepts pantheism ‘with a twist.’ Like other pantheists, he believes that God is the universe. But Kant also believes that the universe, beneath the surface, is conscious. My belief is that Kant believed the ‘noumenal’ part of reality to be animate and that the universe only seems to consist mostly of dead matter (with the odd bit of human or animal consciousness thrown in) because we can’t see past the ‘phenomena.’ In other words, Kant believes reality to be a kind of consciousness and that we believe otherwise only because we can’t see past the surface. Empirically speaking, reality is just so much inanimate matter; but transcendentally speaking, reality is consciousness—this consciousness being God. That is what I believe Kant’s view to be, and I will cite passages from the Critique of Pure Reason and other works of his in support of this view. I will also argue that Kant’s views on knowledge in general support this reading of his work. 
While I personally do not know whether God exists or what God is like, I think that Kant’s views about God are more coherent than those of the philosophers with whom I am familiar. Some background may help clarify my meaning. The view of the proverbial ‘man on the street’ is that God is basically a kind of Superman. He is like a person, but better: stronger, smarter, tougher, etc. It is also assumed that God created the universe. (This assumption makes sense: if ‘God’ came into existence after the universe came into existence, then he isn’t really God anymore.) But how can God have all of these characteristics? Suppose that God created the universe. In that case, he’s like somebody who founds a company: after he creates that company, he is just another employee and he can be fired just like anyone else. So while it makes sense to suppose that God created the Universe, his involvement in the universe has to go deeper. 
Kant sees that God has to do more than create the universe. God cannot just be a ‘first domino.’ But Kant also sees that God cannot just be the universe—he cannot just be the totality of rocks and trees and planets and other debris that is dispersed throughout the cosmos. Kant solves this problem by saying that God is identical with the universe, except that he isn’t identical with ‘matter’; he isn’t identical with ‘phenomena’; he isn’t the aspect of the universe that can be known ‘empirically’, to use his term. Rather, God is the universe’s ‘inner essence’, its ‘noumenal’ core; in other words, he is the part that can be known ‘transcendentally.’ 
My argument will be largely based on Kant’s own words but will also involve a certain amount of interpretation and reconstruction. I will also be drawing on insights of scholars I have been reading, especially Peter Strawson and John MacMurray.

Summary of III. ON THE PRIMACY OF PURE PRACTICAL REASON IN ITS CONNECTION WITH 

SPECULATIVE REASON 
There are two kinds of reasoning: “speculative”, meaning theoretical, and “practical.” 
The purpose of speculative reasoning is to discover truths. The purpose of practical reasoning is to decide what to do. 
Speculative reasoning is subordinate to practical reasoning, especially, of course, where the construction of moral and religious systems is concerned. But an awareness 
of this fact has led previous philosophers to advocate views that, if complied with, would debauch people, instead of uplifting them. 
One example is Epicureanism, according to which people should live for the moment. 
Another is Islam, according to which religious obligation is predicated on carnal rewards in the hereafter. 
Summary of 
IV. THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL AS A POSTULATE OF PURE PRACTICAL REASON 
God and the soul are ‘noumena’, as opposed to ‘phenomena’, meaning that they are realities, as opposed to appearances. For this reason, Kant holds, their existence cannot be known directly. 
But their existence can be proved transcendentally, meaning that they can be shown to be logical preconditions for things that we know to exist. 
In this section, a transcendental proof of the immortality of the soul is given. It is shown that morality could not exist unless the soul were immortal. 
It is assumed that morality does in fact exist. In other words, the argument assumes that morality exists and, on that basis, proves the immortality of the soul. It does not assume that the soul is mortal and, on that basis, prove the non-existence of morality. 
That argument is as follows. 
Moral conduct is not about behaving in a way that leads to gratification. It is about behaving in a way that coheres with the universe. This is why the supreme moral law—the categorical imperative, in other words---is to act in a way in which one could coherently want everyone else to act. 
At the same time, moral injunctions must have practical force, which they don’t unless following them brings happiness to those who do so. If the soul is mortal, then we might as well live for the moment and be subhuman pleasure-seekers. But if we are immortal, then we do have a practical incentive to act in a way that brings us into harmony with others and with the universe as a whole, since, under that circumstance, there will not ultimately be a difference self-interesting and moral conduct. 
Summary of 
V. 
THE EXISTENCE OF GOD AS A POSTULATE OF PURE PRACTICAL REASON 
God is not an inventor who exists apart from the universe. He is the principle of rationality that governs and constitutes the universe. 
God is not the cause of the universe’s being rational. God is the universe’s rationality. For there to be a God is for the universe to be governed by rational laws. 
It is a fact that moral obligations exist and that there is such a thing as moral behavior. It is also a fact that moral behavior is behavior that harmonizes with the rationality inherent in the universe. 
Since the very existence such rationality presupposes the existence of God, it follows that the existence of morality presuppose the existence of God. 
Summary of 
VI. ON THE POSTULATES OF PURE PRACTICAL REASON IN GENERAL 
The very existence of practical reason, this being the kind of reasoning involved in our making decisions, involves three assumptions: first, that the soul is immortal (explained above); second, that God exists (explained above); and third, that we are free---since, if we are automatons, then there is nothing for us to decide. 
Summary of 
VII. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO THINK OF AN EXTENSION OF PURE REASON 
FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES WITHOUT THEREBY ALSO EXTENDING ITS COGNITION AS SPECULATIVE? 
The three pillars of practical reasoning are God, the immortality of the soul, and the existence of human freedom. 
But none of these things can be known empirically. Each can be known only through transcendentally, transcendental knowledge being the very opposite of empirical knowledge. 
This is paradoxical, given that action is concerned with concrete realities (meaning those that can only be known empirically), whereas transcendental thought is concerned exclusively with non-concrete realities (meaning those that can only be known transcendentally. 
The solution to this paradox is that the foundations of practical reasoning do not themselves fall within the scope of practical reasoning. 
Summary of 
VIII. ON ASSENT FROM A NEED OF PURE REASON 
Without pure reason, we are animals, who do not act but merely react. Pure reason is what prevents practical reason from collapsing into animalistic reflexes. 
Summary of 
IX. ON THE WISE ADAPTATION OF THE HUMAN B E I N G ' S COGNITIVE FACULTIES TO HIS PRACTICAL VOCATION 
The difference between genuine happiness and mere gratification is that the former is based on pure reason, whereas the latter is devoid of it. 

Three arguments for God’s Existence and Kant’s Criticisms Thereof 
*Ontological: God has every perfection. Existence is a perfection. So God exists. 
*Cosmological: Unmoved mover—every event that isn’t supernatural has a cause. But the first event could not have had a cause. So it had to be self-caused and therefore supernatural and therefore identical with God. 
*Teleological: Argument from design: The universe is like a clock, and just as clock’s imply clock-makers, so the universe implies a giant clock­maker, namely God. 
Kant’s criticisms of these arguments: 
*Ontological argument: Unless it is assumed that God already exists, it cannot be said that there is a being that has every perfection—only that there would be such a being if God existed—and the ontological argument therefore goes through only if it question-beggingly assumes what it is meant to prove. 
*Cosmological argument: The cosmological argument proves at most that God is just another cause, but that is not what he is God is not just another cause, since he is what makes it possible for there to be causes. 
*Teleological argument: This proves at most that God is another clockmaker, but that is not what he is, since he is what makes it possible for there to be clock-makers. 
Kant’s own arguments for God’s existence: 
*What is contingent presupposes what is necessary. There only be one necessary being, since if there were more than one, all but one of them 
would be redundant and therefore not necessary. This necessary being does not have multiple parts, since what has multiple parts can decompose and therefore isn’t necessary. Since this necessary being is non-composite, it cannot be destroyed and is therefore eternal. Moreover, it has a mind, since, if it didn’t, we couldn’t have minds either. 
*The universe is not merely orderly; it is coherent. Orderliness is a mechanical property; coherence is a psychological property. Therefore, the universe embodies (or itself is) a giant mind, this being God. 
*We have moral obligations, and when we violate them, we introduce incoherence into the world. Therefore, morality presupposes the existences of some kind of cosmic coherence, which, for reason given moment ago, means that there is a God. 
Takeaways: God is not cause. God is ground. Cause is known through causal inference. Ground is known through logical (‘transcendental’) inference. God is not responsible for events. God is responsible for the very possibility of events. 
What Does Kant Conceive God to Be? 

My Research Question 
What does Kant conceive God to be? That is my research-question. 
The answer, I believe, is that Kant accepts a form of pantheism, with the qualification that, in Kant’s view, the world seems to be inanimate because we have knowledge not of its inner (‘noumenal’) essence but only of its outer (‘phenomenal’) exterior. Thus, whereas Spinoza’s pantheism is a form of atheism, the reason being that Spinoza does not distinguish between phenomenal and noumenal reality, Kant’s pantheism is a form of theism, the reason being that he does make this distinction. In my paper, I would like to provide exegetical support for this reading of Kant, and I would then like to evaluate the feasibility of this conception of God. By way of anticipation, I believe that Kant does a better job than any other philosopher known to me of showing that God at least could exist while having at least some of the attributes ascribed to him by those who believe in his existence. Right now, I would like to outline the thinking that led me to this position. 
First of all, the very concept of God is paradoxical. For if God caused the world to exist, then, since cause and effect are distinct, he does not constitute it; and if he does not constitute it, then is just one more occupant of it, in which case, he falls short of being what God is supposed to be. But if God didn’t cause the world to exist and, moreover, he does constitute it, in which case God isn’t anything over and above the bits of matter and energy that make up reality, in which case the assertion that God exists collapses into its own negation. 
Kant is obviously aware of this paradox; and he seems to hint at ways of resolving it. He clearly rejects the view that God is a great machinist who, while being causally responsible for the worlds, stands apart from it. At the same time, he rejects the view, held by Spinoza, that God and 
spatiotemporal reality are indistinguishable, a consequence of which is that, setting aside the odd droplets of sapience in the universe, God is so much dead matter. 
Kant’s position is that God is indeed supremely sapient. At the same time, so Kant seems to hold, it is not by causing the world to exist that God is responsible for it, but by grounding it. To this extent, Kant’s position would seem to collapse into Spinoza’s. But Kant sees this pitfall and sidesteps it, his position being, it appears, that the universe is ‘crypto­sapient.’ Whereas Spinoza’s view was that the universe is the way it appears to be—inanimate when it appears inanimate, and animate on the rare occasions that it appears animate—Kant’s view seems to be that the universe, though for the most part seemingly inanimate, is (or has) a mind, this mind being God. 
Kant famously distinguishes between noumena and phenomena. Phenomena are what we can observe, along with we can legitimately posit on the basis of observation (e.g. microparticles). Noumena are inner essences that are inherently inaccessible to observation and extrapolations based thereupon. Kant seems to hold that human souls are noumena and also that God is a noumenon. 
According to Kant, God and human souls are not to be known empirically (through observation) but rather transcendentally (through pure reason). Kant also holds that the empirical knowledge that we have of the physical universe is really only knowledge of the outer shells of its objects, not of their inner essences. A corollary, as Kant seems to know, is that, for all we know, these inner essences might be animate. I therefore suggest that, in Kant’s view, God is composed of the noumena underlying these phenomena. 
I have already researched this topic and found a number of authors to be illuminating. These authors include Bertrand Russell, especially his discussion of the nature of matter, and or knowledge thereof, in Human Knowledge: Its Scope and Limits. I have also found striking insights about Kant’s views in the works of Peter Strawson (The Bounds of Sense), Jonathan Bennett (Kant’s Analytic), and John MacMurray (The Boundaries of Science). 

Summary of Chapter Three Section Three “The grounds of proof of speculative reason for inferring the existence of a highest being” 
Things that exist contingently (i.e. accidentally) do so only thanks to something that exists necessarily: 
(1) 
“If something, no matter what, exists, then it must also be conceded that something exists necessarily” (CPR, p. 560). 

Kant then attempts to prove this principle: 

(2) 
“For the contingent exists only under the condition of something else as its cause, and from this the same inference holds further all the way to a cause not existing contingently and therefore necessarily without contingent” (CPR, p. 560). 

(2) 
really just restates (1) and is therefore question-begging and devoid of force. But (2) is really just a misconceived way of expressing a line of reasoning that, unlike (2), does have force, namely: 

(3) 
Let X be some contingent being. X’s existence is a mere accident, the possibility of X existence cannot possibly be a mere accident. It is an accident which possibilities are actualized, but not which possibilities exist to be actualized. Therefore, the basis of the possibility of X’s existing lies in something that, unlike X itself, exists necessarily. 


(3) is a line of reasoning that comes up again and again in Kant’s work. 
In what remains of this section, Kant very obscurely touches on some ideas that he discusses more thoroughly later on. 
First, he mentions the Ontological argument: 
(4) 
“[Once] reason takes it as already settled that something or other exists with absolute necessity, [it then tries to] derive it from its concept alone” (p. 560) 

In other words, once people realize that there exists a necessary being, they are tempted to show that the very concept of that being entails its own existence. In other words, 

(5) 
God does exist because he could exist, this being the essence of Ontological argument. 


Elsewhere, Kant rejects the Ontological argument. But in this particular context, he brings it up not to condemn it but only to explain its appeal. 
Kant also cryptically but pregnantly says that “the unity of reality is… the basis of possibility” (p. 
561). It is not clear what he means by this, but it obviously ties into a proof that he gives (discussed in 
the other paper) of the existence of God, namely: 
(6) Nature is not merely orderly but also unified, i.e. coherent, which bespeaks the existence of a higher sapient being. 
Kant also vaguely seems to put forth an argument to the effect that 
there can be only one God: 
(7) “[A] being that contains all reality, hence all conditions, [is] absolutely unconditioned and [is therefore] a thing which is suited for absolute necessity” (p. 562). 
This argument seems to be to the following effect: 
(8) Anything capable of being God must “contain all of reality”, 
i.e. be solely responsible for all of reality—and not just be responsible for it, but constitute it. Given that there obviously can exist at most one such being, there can only be one God. 
One of the conceits embodied in this argument is that God is to be thought of not as the cause of reality but as its ground, the idea being that, if God were a mere cause, he would ultimately be just another run-of-the­mill occupant of space-time, whereas he is more than this if he is its ground. 
On page 562, Kant puts forth an extremely obscure argument that seems to concern some kind of link between our moral obligations and God’s existence: 
(9) 
“For suppose there were obligations that were entirely correct in the idea of reason but would have no real application to us, i.e. would e without any incentives, if a highest being were not presupposed, who could give effect and emphasis to the practical laws; then we would also have an obligation to follow those concepts, that even though they may not be objectively sufficient, are still preponderant in accordance with the measure of our reason, and in comparison with which we recognize nothing better or more convincing” (CPR, p. 562). 

The key idea here seems to be this: 

(10) 
there are certain rules that we must have to follow, even though following them does not in and of itself do us any good; but thanks to God’s existence, we have some kind of practical reason to follow them. 


Obviously (10) is a weak (or enthymematic) argument, but it is very hard to find any other meaning (9); and there is evidence, in other parts of Kant, that he thought along these lines. 
In the last paragraph of this section, Kant brings together some of the 
just-discussed points: 
(10) “One sees things alter, arise, and perish; therefore…they must have a cause…Now where could we more appropriately locate the supreme causality than right where the highest causality is, i.e. in that being originally within itself what is sufficient for the possible effect, whose concept also about very easily through the single trait of an all encompassing-perfection” (p. 562) 
The idea here seems to be that God exists unconditionally and is himself the condition for everything else’s existence.
