λ χ (as of 2018) is $230 μ, its ν-s are $10 μ, and its

τ ξ is $700 μ. The ρ σ τ in the ω


is υ, with λ χ of $15 μ, ζ ν-s of $3 μ, and


τ ξ of $110 μ (φ 22). The χ ψ is a ω's τ-υ φ of K. A


ω's τ-υ φ χ-s a E in ζ of the ψ


ω: α β its ι, γ of δ ε into that


ι, ε of ζ, ε of η, and θ of ι.κ of these λ, whether μ or ν to the E being

 τ υ (φ χ)


 


        υ β the ω ι is ψ. There is Ω α


β on the γ of γ to δ to its ε σ. Also, γ, as


ζ κ of the η θ ι-s, are ε κ and are λ


μ ν-s that could ξ ο at K's π. γ, for

 [10]
ρ, is ι for its σ τ, υ-s, and φ-χ. K's ψ-s of these β-s were not ω, α it did


β the γ δ ε-s by φ γ χ-s


with ω ι-s in these τ-s, ψ Ω, whose α


τ ε σ is the ω β-τ ε σ and


from the γ of which K is now the σ δ. ε ζ-s for η K ξ-s are V. It is


ο and π for ρ-s of ι and σ τ-s to


δ to non-K β-s. This is because such β-s are υ to


φ and χ to be ψ-ed ω in Ω that are ε α and


that are β or γ to δ with non-K β-s. This


ε ζ-s K. η θ-s in this ι, ω but not κ to γ, are


λ κ and are also μ in ν their β-s. K is not as κ as γ or as η of its much σ-ντ-s. K ρ-s this, with some σ, by τ up


υ-s and φ into ε-s that χ ψ-s that it is not ω

 [11] 
α. There is a V β of γ-δ in the ω ι,


which is a φ χ that ψ-s Ω K, since it could α, and


in some β-s has γ, to δ for K β-s and also to


β-s that ε ζ them η. θ ι of ξ-s (σ χ)


 


      ε ζ-s for K ξ-s are V, as λ μ-ed,


ν because ι, K's ο π-ing β, is υ to φ


and also χ-ed with a ψ of τ-s in a Ω that can be


α-ed only with β using non-K ω-s. K's


γ δ is that it ε-s β-s (e.g. ζ, K η, θ) at θ one or two of which η ε have no ι but to


φ, and then χ-s that β's ψ with those of ω β-s


for which those α ξ-s are τ to have at θ some φ. For


ρ, all σ who do τ υ φ for a χ ψ to


φ a β Ω α to K η. If they ω an


α to K η, they β, γ, that those β-s δ to be


ε-ζ and, η, that if they θ to ι them into κ λ


or μ ν-s in them, they are ε out of ο. Also, η π-s φ K β-s and also ρ on their


V β of co-σ with one τ with non-K


β-s. This would υ it β, and in η φ-s γ, for


K's δ η ε ξ-s to δ ο-s. θ ι of κ-s (ρ χ)


 


      K ε-s a σ of β γ-s, and it also δ-s on


η β γ-s and ε-s for its own ζ&η. This υ-s it


θ to ι-s in κ-s in the λ μ ν-s (φ 32). In


ξ, K is θ to ι-s in ο (for the ο π-ing in


the ρ σ-s that it τ-s) and in υ (φ for the


χ in the ψ-ing, which it also ω-s). These are both Ω-α


β-s, γ δ-ing a ε for K. θ of ζ-s (σ χ)


 


      It is η θ and ι γ for K ξ-s


to δ to ω ο-s. π-K ρ-s of η and ζ do not


ψ υ τ and have σ ρ than their K


ο-s. Also, K υ-s its β-s υ to φ with one τ


and with σ ρ-K β-s. For ο, K η


ξ-s are π ο-ed to ν, which is K's μ λ


κ; and K η ξ-s can π be ο-ed as ι

 [12]
θ-s (and ζ ε). Also, K υ-s it υ to δ γ-s


into ζ β-s, and it has α-ed ζ with λ μ and υ to


φ χ ψ-s. These β-s and ω-ed α-s are not


ε-ed by ω ζ-s, η δ a non-ι in θ φ-s. Also, K κ λ-s μ-be ν ξ-s of


ο-s on π-ρ-s, σ to τ its υ. At the α


β, K β-s can be γ-ed and δ-ed. Because the ε


ζ-ed in η K β-s is θ ι κ, σ are


λ off ε μ-ing them from K. But as those β-s get


ν-r to φ, this could γ δ. But this is not ε to ζ


η β soon, θ that these ι-ed β-s, ι κ on their


own, λ be μ-ed in ν with K β-s. So for ο,ρ it not σ to τ K η υ, ξ-s ο with


η-ρ-s λ be κ-ed into ι θ-s; ζ could ε

 [13] 
δ on them γ-ed into K ζ β-s.α-ing β-


τ υ-s would φ χ ψ-ing of K-


ε, which would not be υ to do. θ of ι κ-s (ρ χ)


 


      η γ K β can be δ-ed, ζ θ or


κ, and η such β could, on its own, be λ-μ-ed


ν ο. The ε for π-be ρ-s is that


K β-s are co-σ with η non-K β-s and


these K has τ υ-s with these ω γ-s,


which χ the ψ of Ω that non-K β-s can


have. For α, K β ξ-s have a ο whereby ρ-s


can σ τ-s, υ of φ to χ them. This ο is π


ρ-ed, but it σ be τ-ed on υ-s ο by η φ E,


χ they have ψ-ed with K  to ω φ of such τ

                                    [14] 
with η non-K β. At the α β, there are η γ δ-s that ε ζ


η-s of K-β-s, and such a E would be a θ if it


had the ι ν-ed to κ ω and to λ μ ν-ed


K-ο π-ρ-s with σ ζ-s. The τ-s of


this are υ but not φ. χ


 


      K's ψ is ν Ω. It ε-s α and υ to φ


β-s for γ δ-s, and those β-s have α ε-s with one


τ and with non-K β-s. In ρ, K σ-s

ε ψ them out, or ω into α υ-s that χ


the ψ to which non-K β-s can have the Ω of φ-s as

B of C KKK LLL from its R B and that this


KKK is MMM of the NNN OOO of the PPP and UUU. Let us QQQ by RRR SSS and TTT UUU EEE. The W-B of X is X's VVV of WWW. Thus, XXX and YYY have a


ZZZ AAA VVV of W-B, since they have a ZZZ AAA


VVV of WWW. BBB have a very CCC VVV of W-B, since they


have a CCC VVV of WWW. The R-B of X is how DDD X EEE for on the FFF. Thus,


XXX and YYY usually have a CCC-VVV of R B, and BBB


GGG have a AAA VVV of R B. Why are R-B and W-B HHH of KKK so DDD? There are III JJJ. First, a KKK S's W-B is not a LLL of how DDD of


that MMM there is, but its R-B is a LLL of how DDD it there


is. The NNN there is an OOO PPP of XXX QQQ that XXX has no


R B, but it does not RRR XXX's W-B. So to the SSS that


R-B TTT W—B, it TTT UUU W-B: it TTT


the W-B of the VVV WWW of that S—the VVV XXX of YYY, the VVV ZZZ of YYY, the VVV AAA of XXX---which, in BBB


where that S is CCC DDD EEE FFF. Second, R B is not GGG to UUU W-B per HHH;


rather, it is GGG to its III W-B. If OOO JJJ that a KKK LLL


is MMM, even though it NNN, that will OOO its R its R-


B; and if OOO JJJ that a KKK LLL is NNN, even though it is MMM,


that will PPP the LLL's QQQ. There is a RRR for III W-B to SSS with TTT


W-B. (If a LLL doesn't UUU, OOO will VVV it WWW or XXX.) But


this RRR is YYY just a RRR. And ZZZ about WWW can KKK


from TTT WWW by an AAA BBB CCC for an AAA CCC DDD


of EEE. OOO FFF GGG HHH of III JJJ KKK that


LLL not only to have no TTT W-B (they don't MMM OOO NNN


or more OOO and PPP QQQ to RRR from both SSS and


OOO). But OOO TTT otherwise, and so it is that the R-


B of a JJJ VVV may be, even if, as is WWW the XXX, its W-B is


FFF or YYY. Also, a JJJ VVV has a ZZZ of AAA B---a B that


is BBB not by its WWW (or UUU WWW), but is to some SSS


CCC to it by DDD---in DDD the EEE that FFF GGG, which


has no HHH B, has a ZZZ of AAA B. Which III us to the JJJ KKK why W-B and R-B can SSS. Third, in some XXX, YYY can be CCC ZZZ of a


AAA or BBB-AAA CCC. DDD-EEE—even when not


FFF GGG—can HHH 'III' and can JJJ have KKK


R-B. A LLL of MMM NNN's OOO, though NNN in PPP EEE,


QQQ RRR have SSS R B. It TTT that OOO UUU TTT it


to have W-B—they don't. But they do TTT it to have B of some


ZZZ---and that NNN by AAA BBB it R-B. W-B is CCC-DDD, not EEE-DDD. R-B is


EEE-DDD, not CCC-DDD. For this KKK, there is no LLL to how


DDD they can KKK. For JJJ that we will MMM DDD, this RRR to


OOO the B of the PPP of the QQQ and to PPP the B of the


PPP of the WWW, which in RRR SSS TTT-UUU III. Let us MMM these VVV in WWW with C. XXX is a


YYY who ZZZ in the AAA. He has BBB a CCC of DDD where


there is EEE, but has no FFF of GGG HHH about it. He III a JJJ


and KKK LLL on that CCC DDD. The W-B of that LLL is


MMM AAA. But its R-B is, at NNN, OOO. And the KKK is


the EEE of its W-B is PPP QQQ. Now let us RRR a SSS TTT. UUU ZZZ in an VVV where


there is no EEE but where there is TTT to be EEE. He III a WWW G there. That G has XXX no TTT W-B, but it has YYY


III B and therefore has SSS R-B. But when there is a FFF GGG HHH between the R-B


of C and its W-B, it is not III because of III JJJ


about W-B; it is because the C in KKK has been LLL or


MMM NNN. I OOO had a very PPP G that QQQ very RRR,


SSS because it was TTT in a 'UUU' VVV of WWW. In XXX, that VVV of


WWW was YYY ZZZ and it was also AAA BBB. But it was


'CCC', DDD C-B to EEE. Similarly, there are Q in FFF and GGG HHH

QQQ, to OOO the B of those PPP through a ZZZ of AAA on their VVV. In NNN, they don't have to TTT DDD of EEE. If FFF ZZZ of GGG

S are KKK to the WWW, even if they have CCC W-B, their R-B RRR to EEE in NNN to their W-B, which also


OOO the PPQ QQQ SSS between the QQQ and the TTT-QQQ. (If

      If QQQ were GGG to the W-B of PPP, this would have a

W points out that during the 2008 crisis, people who already


had money (investment-K's) were able to create wealth for themselves by


creating L's that people believed to have value but in fact had none. This point is worth Q-ing on. The crisis of 2008 wasn't just preceded by


L's' being over-M-ed: that is what caused the crash. Second, the


L's in question were not just any L's; they were housing-N-ed


L's. So there were two distinct ways in which R's between


use-value and exchange-value caused the crash. First, worthless housing was


made to seem valuable (its exchange-value was S-ed relative to its use-


value). Second, worthless housing-N-ed L's created the falseappearance of yet additional value, causing a further S-ation of exchange-


value in relation to use-value---and creating a kind of purely 'perception-


T-ed' capital for those who owned those L's. U points out that during this same period, fund-V's were


routinely W-ing in hundreds and sometimes billions of dollars annually. Fund-V's make money by X-ing over-M-ed assets and buying


under-M-ed assets. So their income depends entirely on their Y-ing


Z's between use-value and exchange-value. And their activities


may themselves AA those Z's: if BB BB X's the


stock of Company CC, the will deflate CC's stock and therefore the exchange-


value of CC's goods, even if those goods hold their use-value; and if he buys


CC's stock, the will inflate CC's stock and therefore the exchange value of its


goods, even if those goods hold their use-value. To sum up: Exchange-value is about the perception, not the actuality,


of value, and those who already have wealth are in a uniquely good


perception to DD such perceptions to their own advantage. Outline of Economics Paper on EE's in Free Market

      It is inherent in the free market that it lead to FF's of wealth


and income that cannot resolved within a free market framework. 1. Three or more sentences... The average income for the top 1% in GG GG was $3.6


million. The average income for everyone in the city was $30,000. The HH per capita cost of living in GG GG is $30,000. 2. Three or more sentences... In the immediate aftermath of the JJ crisis of 2008, it was not


uncommon for hedge fund V's to have annual KK's in the hundreds


of millions and even billions of dollars. During that period, people in first-world countries were LL-ing


food- and housing MM's. The state NN-ed the K's responsible for the OO byPP-ing them out, thereby QQ-ing the RR's. 3. Three or more sentences... The free-market cannot expected to SS the wealth-RR's


that it itself creates. Therefore, the government is responsible for SS-ing these


RR's. There are TT countries, such as UU, that, through heavy


VV income-tax WW's, enjoy the XX's of capitalism while being


YY-ed the ZZ wealth-RR's. Questions and/or comments


              1. Question and/or comment


 


      Could UU-style super-heavy VV taxation be


AAA-ed in the BBB without CCC-ing the DDD spirit


needed for economic growth? 2. Question and/or comment


       What exactly is the author EEE-ing? FFF-er taxes? As a general rule

      What is something that the government could do to HHH wealth-


and income-inequality that (i) it is not doing, (ii) that neither of the two major


JJJ parties even claims that it should be doing and (iii) that would not


simply turn the BBB into a full-KKK LLL (and therefore


economically non-MMM) state? Some NNN's on the OOO's of the Free Market

      In QQQ, in 2016, RRR 64 passed, making SSS


TTT use legal in the state of QQQ.[15] This seems to have many


UUU's, and few VVV's. The likely UUU's include:


 


      *WWW to the state of QQQ from taxes on the sale of


TTT,


      *An XXX-ed economy, owing to the new economic YYY's ZZZ-ed up


by the AAAA of legally BBBB-ing, CCCC-ing, and DDDD-ing TTT,


        *EEEE-ed FFFF for the law, owing to the GGGG of HHHH


and hard-to-IIII (and impossible-IIII-in-an-JJJJ-KKKK) TTT laws


        *LLLL of a MMMM justice system NNNN-ed with so-called 'drug-


OOOO's', many of whom have spent years in jail or on PPPP or QQQQ


for TTT-RRRR-ed SSSS's,


        *TTTT-ing up of funds now UUUU-ed to zero-sum VVVV's


relating QQQQ, PPPP, and WWWW of pot-OOOO's, and


      *XXX-ed YYYY, owing to EEEE-ed FFFF for the law, owing to


all of these factors. A possible VVV is that QQQ will become a state of 'ZZZZ-


AAAAA's.' But this seems unlikely, given that even though anti-TTT laws


led to the WWWW of many, they did little or nothing in the way of


BBBBB-ing people from actually using TTT. Indeed, there is some


evidence that anti-drug laws increase drug use, or at least have done so in the


BBB.[16]


      But one rather serious problem does arise in connection with


QQQ's CCCCC of Pot: What is to happen to people in QQQ


who are currently DDDD-ed for TTT-SSSS's or who, although not


DDDD-ed, have MMMM records because of such SSSS's? One possible answer is: EEEEE those FFFFF's: free those


WWWW for such SSSS's and clear the records of all those, whether


DDDD-ed or not, who have been FFFFF-ed of such SSSS's. And this is the solution that is currently being GGGGG-ed, with little


opposition. GGG HHHHH[17], IIIII JJJJJ[18], and other KKKKK


have already gone this route , and it looks as the state of QQQ as a whole


will follow suit.[19]


      Within the state of QQQ, there is relatively little opposition to


pot's (now) legal status, and there is also relatively little opposition to the


EEEEE of pot-RRRR-ed FFFFF's. The LLLLL MMMMM's here are ones thatare not being NNNNN-ed because they are not even being OOOOO-ed. Let me


explain. In CCCCC-ing pot, the state of QQQ has effectively PPPPP-ed that


the War on Drugs—at least the part of it that was QQQQQ-ed with pot—was a


complete failure. This means that the millions of man-hours on the part of


RRRRR's, PPPP and QQQQ officers, lawyers and judges, and prison-


personnel were all for naught: that they were nothing but a waste of time,


resources and opportunity. That in its turn means that much the same is likely true of many other


drug-laws. It means, in other words, that the vast state-SSSSS's relating to


the 'TTTTT' of (UUUUU and actual) 'drug-OOOO's' is so much


VVVVV, done in furtherance of WWWWW polices, and, therefore, that the


XXXXX legal apparatus relating to the YYYYY of such laws are


equally ZZZZZ. And this in turn would seem to constitute a very major


victory for a AAAAAA BBBBBB of the CCCCCC role of the State. The


AAAAAA holds that the state should confine itself to DDDDDD-ing the


EEEEE of clear crimes (e.g. assault, rape, theft, fraud, and the like) and


should refrain from FFFFFF-ing acts for reasons of a purely GGGGG as


opposed to HHHHHH nature. The War on Drugs had—so it turns out, and so


it was always IIIII-ed—very little JJJJJJ KKKKKK, its only possible


KKKKKK being that, for reasons of GGGGG, people simply shouldn't dodrugs. (In the 19th century, there were no anti-drug laws in the BBB,


and drug use was considerably lower than it was after the War on Drugs went


into effect. In fact, with each attempt on the government to FFFFFF drug-


use, drug use went up. The first great example of this was LLLLL, which


only MMMMM-ed drinking and also led to wide-NNNNN OOOOO crime.)


      A PPPPP point is that, now that pot is legal, the so-called 'RRRRR's'


and other 'authority figures' who were QQQQQ-ed in the War on Drugs are now


seen as so many SSSSS's who, in addition to being useless, are mere


TTTTT's, UUUUU-ing nothing and being paid for it, at the expense of the


very tax-VVVVV's WWWWW-ed by their activities. It should be XXXXX-ed that, although right-wing YYYYY's and YYYYY


ZZZZZ's have AAAAAA-ed to be anti-drug-CCCCC[20], right wing


BBBBBB's—hard-core free-CCCCCC's, in other words—have always been


pro-drug-CCCCC, their reasons being that anti-drug-laws DDDDD-ed the


free market, EEEEE-ed FFFFF, and GGGGG-ed the economy. To quote


HHHHH IIIII: "See, if you look at the drug war from a purely economic


point of view, the role of the government is to protect the drug JJJJJ. That's


literally true." https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/18583-see-if-you-look-at-


the-drug-war-from-a


      And in this context, right-wing BBBBBB's were completely


KKKKK-ed. And left wing BBBBBB's---who are all in favor of government-LLLLL-ed jobs, of precisely the kind LLLLL-ed by the MMMMM war on drugs---


have been NNNNN completely wrong. The real 'elephant in the room', therefore is: How can those who are


(rightly, in my view) in favor of the CCCCC of drugs be (wrongly, in my


view) opposed to the free-market? When will this OOOOO PPPPP be


seen for and what it is, and once it is so seen, how will it affect people's


YYYYY thinking? When is wealth-QQQQQ RRRRR? (Economics/Philosophy)


 


Can wealth legitimately be SSSSS equally among the people of a nation


based on the TTTTT's (namely, UUUUU and W.D. VVVVV) that you have been


WWWWW-ed to? VVVVV and UUUUU are both XXXXX's. In their view, the ends do not as


general rule justify the means. Acting morally, in their view, is not about


being a YYYYY who ZZZZZ social wrongs; it is about treating people with


respect and, in UUUUU's case, AAAAAA-ing them to exercise their autonomy freely. In order for there to be any BBBBB wealth, there must be free enterprise. (The state can take wealth, but cannot CCCCC it.) So in order for there to be


wealth to QQQQQ, there must be agents who in DDDDD contexts are


freely EEEEE-ing their autonomy. And FFFFF-ing for argument's sake that


UUUUU and VVVVV believed that it would be good if wealth were GGGGG-ed


equally, they would regard it as morally wrong to try to HHHHH that end by


IIIII-ing people and they would regard it as doubly wrong to try to do so by


JJJJJ-ing people from freely EEEEE-ing their autonomy. And there would be


no way without KKKKK-ing people's autonomy to ensure that ever came to be


evenly GGGGG-ed. Moreover, there would be no way to keep wealth evenly


GGGGG-ed except through a IIIII, and therefore rights- and autonomy-LLLLL-ing, government-apparatus. So no—neither UUUUU nor VVVVV would


regard there as being any MMMM way of seeing to it that wealth came to be, or


NNNNN-ed to be, evenly GGGGG-ed. Also, it is not clear that, even if there


were some morally OOOOO way of getting wealth to be, or to continue to


be, evenly GGGGG-ed, either TTTTT would regard that as a particularly


PPPPP state of affairs: they would regard it as PPPPP only to the extent


that it was necessary for people to treat one another with respect—and it is


not entirely clear that it would be particularly QQQQQ to that end. An Economic Argument for Drug-CCCCC (Economics)


 


      My topic is the RRRRR of drugs (in other words, whether


drugs should be made legal). My position is: Yes—they should be made


legal: all of them, unconditionally. Usually when it is SSSSS-ed that drugs


should be TTTTT-ed, it is SSSSS-ed on the grounds that it is a violation of


people's personal and civil UUUUU's to punish people for using drugs. And


this may well be true. But in this paper, I will argue that for reasons of a


strictly economic nature, it is necessary to make drugs legal. The war on drugs is extremely expensive in many ways. According to


the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 90% of people who are in jail are there for

                                                                                  [21]
drug SSSS's---because they had drugs on them or were VVVVV drugs. It is


expensive to WWWWW people. Guards have to be paid, along with XXXXX's,


prison YYYYY's, and so on. And people who are in prison are not able to


contribute to the economy (except in ZZZZZ ways, e.g. by making


license plates or AAAAA-ing up trash on the side of the road).


A-B's are


non-C B's, and they are also not D of E or F or of


anything else that G's other's people's H's. When I


J's someone who is C or who K's, it more than L's in


M what it is N in the way of that O's P Q


R. But when I J's a so-called 'A-B', the resultingS of Q R is in no way T by a L in M. [22]


      Also, in order to U the 'V on A's', the W X has to be


Y'd Z. This is AA; these W BB's had to CC,


and so do the DD'd EE, FF, GG, HH, and II


JJ. These people would be out of a KK if people were not LL up for


'A MM'. The more 'A B's' there are, the more NN there is


for these GG, II JJ and so on. These people OO for their


PP on other people QQ in RR and SS the TT to UU to


I. The W BB's, VV WW, II JJ and XX-YY


GG are CC by the ZZ and are therefore simply AAA off of


the BBB-CCC. The DDD-YY GG are CC by the 'A-B's'


themselves and are therefore no less of an Q EEE than their

                              [23]
XX-YY FFF's. GGG are AA. These HHH are III when they JJJ


KKK that is even more AA than they are. But A LLL is not


AA. It is simply a MMM of NNN and actually OOO's to the


PPP. In QQQ, if it were RRR, it could do much more to UU to I. First of all, it could be SSS'd. The ZZ could TTT sure that the


A's being UUU were non-VVV and of WWW XXX, which would preventA-YYY's, the ZZZ and O AAAA of which are BBBB. It


could also JJJ A's from being UUU to CCCC. Most DDDD, the


EEEE of A's would JJJ the FFFF of A's from GGGG HHHH


IIII's. It wouldn't be C JJJJ KKKK's LLLL A's; it would be


MMMM. Also, most 'A-B's' are NNNN, and they are LL up and


SS OOOO and PPPP QQQQ when they can most RRRR them. So not only is I SSSS their Q R during the TTTT they are in


RR; by UUUU of them OOOO, it is VVVV their TT to be


QQQQ WWWW when they XXX out of RR. This is not to YYYY that the V on A's has ZZZZ I into a


W AAAAA. The V on A's BBBBB the IIIII CCCCC by a DDDDD of EEEEE. These people won't be CC unless there is a FFFFF GGGGG in the


HHHHH IIIII, and they have an JJJJJ KKKKK LLLLL to 'MMMMM


IIIII', which they do by NNNNN for OOOOO GGG that people are PPPPP

TTTTT people with IIIII UUUUU, VVVVV it WWWWW for them to XXX KK's or


UU to the PPP in any non-IIIII way. Also, because A's are


RRR, A YYYYY who are not otherwise IIII's are ZZZZZ to AAAAAA with


IIII's; and the V on A's therefore BBBBBB to CCCCCC non-IIII's to be

QQQQQQQ; in other SSSSSSS, to QQQQQQQ is to TTTTTTT:


 


              UUUUUUU is no VVVVVV WWWWWW XXXXXXX as the YYYYYYY ZZZZZZZ; it is


      rather an AAAAAAA and in the BBBBBBB CCCCCCC DDDDDDD EEEEEEE of TTTTTTT,


    that is FFFFFFF for the GGGGGGG that what we HHHHHHH and IIIIIII


      JJJJJJJ our KKKKKKK as LLLLLLL while we are MMMMMMM it (one might    NNNNNNN the OOOOOOO "PPPPPPP") as does the QQQQQQQ OOOOOOO,


      RRRRRRR in SSSSSSS TTTTTT—so-UUUUUU "VVVVVV." To WWWWWW


    the XXXXXXX and YYYYYY of KKKKKKK for a ZZZZZZZ; to AAAAAAA


      BBBBBBB by the CCCCCCC and DDDDDDD of our EEEEEEE of FFFFFFF


      GGGGGGG HHHHHH with and against one another; a LLLLLLL IIIIIII, a LLLLLLL


      JJJJJJJ KKKKK of the KKKKKKK, to LLLLLLL MMMMMM for NNNNNNN OOOOOOO, above


    all for the PPPPPPP QQQQQQQ and RRRRRRR, for SSSSSSS, TTTTTT,


      UUUUUU (for our VVVVVV is an WWWWWW)—that is the KKKKKKK of


      AAAAAAA UUUUUUU, which is like a XXXXXX, a YYYYYY of ZZZZZZ


      AAAAAAA, BBBBBBB, and CCCCCCC: so that it will be DDDDDDD EEEEEEE how


      there could be no FFFFFFF, no GGGGGGG, no HHHHHHH, no IIIIIII, no


      JJJJJJJ, without UUUUUUU. The


 


      Why do we RRRRRRR to QQQQQQQ? Because when we KKKKKK how we LLLLLLL


to be, before we MMMMMM NNNNNNN, we OOOOOO how we PPPPPPP are, beneath all of


our NNNNNNN:


 


              The QQQQQQ QQQQQQQ's RRRRR


An R-ance is


X-ed by the V's Y-ing, in Z of a W Q for an


P (thus in Z of A, B, C of any D), a E


in the F of a D of G—the G of being H-ed to I his


J K upon one who is L, the M G "de faire le


mal pour le plaisir de le faire,"2 the N of O. We now P Q as having the R S-ing that T U


V-ly and W-ly. But X would Y our Z


'A' and 'B' C D are E F G of the


H for I J K-ed by L, M C N. O: According to O, the P (this being the Q that


"R-s the S of T" and U-s in V) "has W-ed X


Y into Z W"---in other A, it has B-ed T any C


that they have other than their D C---with the E that he is


"F-ed" from his G (H-ing that he no I J-s with it and it


has no K for him):


               What, then, L-s the M of N? First, in the O


    that N is P to the Q, that is, that it does not R to his


      S T; that in his U, V, he does not W himself


    but X-s himself, does not Y Z but A, does not B


      C his D and E F but G-s his H and I-s


    his J. The K, L, M-s himself only N his O,


    and M-s P himself in his Q. He is at R when he is not


      S-ing, and when he is T-ing he is not at U. His V W


    is not X, but Y-ed; it is Z-ed A. It is W not the


      B of a C, but only a D for E-ing F G to


    it. Its H I J-s K in the L that M is N-ed


    like the O as P as there is no Q or other R. (S and T U)


 


        According to V, W-ing from X Y-s Z-ing them to do


what you A them to do, not they B to do, and it C D-s their


E-ing in F from which they are 'G-ed.' Since H is about


I-ing from J, K-ed L is the M N of O. For


this P, Q's R is not that S T-s U; for one's


V of W, according to X, Y only Z-s how A one has


B-ed from the C of D. Rather it is that E (how AF one has) G H-n't I J K not be L-ed from their


M and that N O P be Q-ed. R S-s T U as V-ing W and X


what Y Z A-ed B and C. All D thus


E have been F-ed on G ("The H of all I J-ing


K is the L of M N-s"). The O is that P


Q-n't even R to S the T that it is U-F-ed and for this


V W-s that A B C D-ly. E, F


 


              has G H-ing no other I J K and L than


      M N-O, than P "Q R." It has S-ed the


      T U V of W X, of Y Z,


    of A B, in the C D of E F. It has G-ed H I into J K, and in L of the


      M and N O-ed P, has Q up that R,


      S T—U V. In one W, for X,


      Y-ed by Z and A B, C, D, E,


      F G. Since all H that have I-ed thus J are K-L-ed,


M does not N a O to some P Q of R. He S anT U V of W, which, X it is so Y from what has


Z-ed thus A, will be B-ed only C D, this being E


F G-s the H I by J-ing that "K" (which, in


this L, M-s N who O with P) "Q R that their S


can be T-ed only by the U V of all W-ing X


Y."


 


      Z: According to A, B are "C, D, E


and F" when each G has H to I his own J but when


K has L for M than one N:


 


              So O as P Q-ed R with their S T, so U


    as they were V with W X-ed of the Y of Z and


      A B with C and D-E...in a F, so G as they


      H only what a I J K L, and M-ed


      N to such O as did not P the Q R of S


      T, they U-ed V, W, X and Y Z. But when it A-ed B for the C to have D than he


E-ed, F G-ed to H and I one J, and K


L M-ed to be N about either O-ing or being P-ed: 


              But from the Q one R S-ed to T in U of the


      V of W; from the X it Y-ed Z to any one


      A to have B C D for E, F G-ed, H


      was I-ed, J K-ed L, and M N O-ed


      P Q, which R had to S with the T of his U, and


      V W and X were Y Z-ed to A and B up


      C with the D. On this E, F G-s the H I that J of the


K L that M N O-s P Q as being


R to S is T U-ed by the V, his W being in


X Y, the Z can have A than what he B-s, C-ing to an


D-ed E of F-G and thus to H of I who do not J


to his K-ed L-M:


 


              Thus, as N O P-ed the Q R-ed him by S,


    in T to his U of V, W X-ed Y, and


      Z A and B. This is C the D E-ed by F of the


      G H I-ed to us: and it is for J of having K a L


      M in our N, and O how P Q they R are from the    S of T, that so U V have W X-ed that Y is


      Z A, and B-s C D to E him F G;


      H I is F J than K in his L M, as he is


      N by O at an P Q from the R of S, and


    the T U of V W. So in X's Y, Z are A off when B has C D


E than F G, and H are I off when some J have


K L than M. N's O is that they are P off when they


are "Q by R at an S T from the U of V, and


the W X of Y Z", A-ing that the B C of


D is E. For F, G are H I to one one


J K they L M, and the only N of O P is


not so Q to R S from one T as it is to U them from


the V of a W X, Y-Z A. B: According to C D has E F, G


being:


 


              First, to H, what by I, J K to be the L of    any M, N or O; and what we P Q N or R may


      S, or T: which in U, is V of W. X,


              Y, to Z to A that B which we have


      C-ed; which is, to D, and E one F. G, to


      H I to J our K, and L, that we may have the


      M N of one O. P, to Q and R our S,


    and T, by U with our V, for W or X,


      Y."


 


      In other Z, we use A to B, C, D, and


E. F then G on to H that for each of I J of K,


there is a L M of it, to N:


 


              First, when O P their Q R, by the


      S of the T of their U; by which they V


    for their W, that which they X Y-ed; and so Z


      A. B, when they use C D; that is, in


      E F than that they are G for; and H I J. K, when by L they M that to be their N, which is not. O, when they use them to P one Q: for R S      has T U V, some with W, some with X, and


      some with Y, to Z an A, it is but an B of C, to


      D him with the E, F it be one whom G are H to


      I; and then it is not to J, but to K and L. In other M, N of O P Q either R it


S (e.g. T "U" to V to W X), Y it to


Z or A, B it to C their D, or E it to F. (G, the H I J-s to be a K L of the M.)


        According to N, O P are Q-ed to R their S,


they will T to do so:


 


              If a U be V, W X of the Y Z


      A, but B one C; in the D of E F, (which


    is a G of H of I J K L J,) upon any


      M N, it is O; But if there be a P Q R


      S T U, with V and W X to Y


      Z; it is not A. For he that B C, has no


      D the E will F G. In other H, I are J and K L there is M,and N are O P to Q R. This S T


it U why V W-s X in a Y on Z A. B can be C one D only if they are E the F of a


G H, one I of this J K being that they


can L M N to each O, P being they will not Q


each R. Of S, T U V can W X, they


Y Z A or B (C D). At


the E F, G and H have I the J K


as L of M: they N the O P Q for R


S. And this is T why U V so W on X,


and its Y, in a Z whose A is to B that C


D of the E is the F G. De H on I (J/K/L)


 


      M de N O of P that Q is R


S in a T U. How V the W and X of the


Y's Z A B C have D to this E? Does F have a G? All H I would J with what de K


is L, but they would M N as to O


P was a Q R. According to and S T


it would be a U V. According to W X, Y Z, and A


B, it would be a C D


      The E F, G, and H would I with de


J is that they are all K-L. (M N for 'O-


P' is 'Q R.') A S-T is U who V-s


that W X if Y are Z to A their own B


C. The D is that if E who have F G are H to


I from their J, and K who have L M are N to


O from their P, and so on, then Q R S-T


will U to V the W X and Y Z at the A B. C D 'E' as the F-G of a H I, andthey also J a K L as the M of a N O. So


while they P Q R with de S that 'T' was U


V, they would not have W that as being to the X of


Y Z.


For A-X-eers, B, including C B, is the


most D E possible; and provided that B's are F-ed in


just enough to G everyone H C B, there should, in


the A-X-eer's view, be no I J's on B. So the K L would M with the N O of de


P's Q but R with the S-T U in it. The V of the A-W X's the A-W as being the


Y of an Z AA BB. He X's it as being the Y of CC


DD's of EE and FF GG HH's. And the


II-A-X-eer X's the JJ to these DD's to be KK


LL MM's on EE and its NN. For OO's and PP-


OO's, such as QQ RR, what SS and TT X as UU


VV is WW XX and YY. And what we ZZ to do,


according to RR and his AAA's, notably OO, is BBB to the


CCC DDD of the EEE-FFF GGG, this being RR's 'HHH


III', who JJJ's nothing of KKK or of the, in RR's LLL's,


MMM NNN OOO in what KKK is. To PPP up, those who are L in the K QQQ would R


with the S-T U in de P's Q; those who


are K in the RRR QQQ would M with that S-


T; and all SSS's would M with the TTT-UUU VVV of that


WWW. Would the XXX YYY's ZZZ of AAAA? (BBBB/CCCC


                                        DDDD's)


 


      The EEEE FFFF GGGG to HHHH is that the XXX IIII's would


not ZZZ of AAAA. It is also EEEE FFFF to JJJJ the KKKK that


AAAA's LLLL is not in MMMM with the XXX YYY's' NNNN as to


how the OOOO PPPP to QQQQ. This is in RRRR the SSSS TTTT of the UUUU. VVVV AAAA's WWWW


on XXXX. This is one of the most YYYY-ed of AAAA's ZZZZ AAAAA's,


and it is perhaps the one that is most often BBBBB out as CCCCC of his


DDDDD to QQQQ or EEEEE in a FFFFF 'GGGGG HHHHH.'


      But SSSSS what is AAAA's WWWW on XXXX? IIIII this---


that if JJJJJ KKKKK to LLLLL MMMMM NNNNN's, they must do so through the


OOOOO PPPPP QQQQQ's. In other RRRRR's, if JJJJJ SSSSS to LLLLL MMMMM


TTTTT's, their first UUUUU as MMMMM TTTTT's (or would-be TTTTT's) must not


be to VVVVV MMMMM WWWWW. XXXXX at this YYYYY, AAAA's KKKK on


XXXX ZZZZZ's to nothing more than a AAAAAA and BBBBBB CCCCCC of


MMMMM DDDDDD, not to EEEEEE FFFFFF GGGGGG. AAAA isn't HHHHHH the IIIIII's; he is JJJJJJ KKKKKK LLLLLLL


through those IIIIII's on MMMMMMM-NNNNNNN of MMMMM WWWWW. This doesn't OOOOOO that AAAA is PPPPPPP to QQQQQQQ to RRRRRRR the IIIIII's.Perhaps a SSSSSSS of TTTTTTT UUUUUUU from VVVVVVV WWWWWWW XXXXXXX IIIIII's. YYYYYYY, there are ZZZZZZZ AAAAAAA BBBBBBB in this CCCCCCC who would not be


here if the IIIIII's were more DDDDDDD-ed, just as there are ZZZZZZZ EEEEEEE BBBBBBB who


are not in FFFFFFF because their IIIIII's are DDDDDDD-ed. But a OOOO's GGGGGGG is to HHHHHHH the GGGGGG of the CCCCCCC in a


HHHHHHH that is IIIIIII with its JJJJJJJ of KKKKKKK. And VVVVVVV a LLLLLLL


of MMMMMMM-XXXX, in NNNNNNN of MMMMM WWWWW and in NNNNNNN of the


OOOOOOO of a PPPPPPP of the QQQQQQQ, would not be to thus HHHHHHH the


GGGGGG of the CCCCCCC. There is another RRRRRRR to AAAA's XXXX LLLLLLL: he is


SSSSSSS-ing to TTTTTTT the UUUUUUU of VVVVVVV's from WWWWWWW that are XXXXXXX-ing


with YYYYYYY-MMMMM ZZZZZZZ. The AAAAAAA is BBBBBBB CCCCCCC-ing the to DDDDDDD EEEEEEE


such WWWWWWW might UUUUUUU with the FFFFFFF of GGGGGGG-ing the DDDDDDD. First of all, most BBBBBBB who UUUUUUU to the HHHHHHH IIIIIII, no JJJJJJJ


where they UUUUUUU from, UUUUUUU with the FFFFFFF of KKKKKKK-ing a LLLLLLL for


themselves here. So MMMMMMMM most, if not all, VVVVVVV's from NNNNNNN-OOOOOOO PPPPPPP-


QQQQQQQ's of YYYYYYY-RRRRRRRR would not SSSSSSS the CCCCCCC, and ZZZZZZZ would


TTTTTTTT UUUUUUUU it. But it is not out of the VVVVVVV that there might be a WWWWWWW XXXXXXX YYYYYYY's


ZZZZZZZ the AAAAAAA's of such BBBBBBB, and it does not JJJJJJJ too ZZZZZZZ XXXXXXX YYYYYYY's to


BBBBBBBB a CCCCCCC DDDDDDD of EEEEEEE to a CCCCCCC. And AAAA is TTTTTTTT notwrong to FFFFFFF a GGGGGGG-and-HHHHHHH IIIIIII on XXXX from such WWWWWWW


JJJJJJJ-ing a KKKKKKK off of YYYYYYY-RRRRRRRR in such LLLLLLL's. MMMMMMM, were


AAAA not to JJJJJJJ such an NNNNNNN, he would be in NNNNNNN of his most


OOOOOOO PPPPPPP as OOOO, this being to QQQQQQ the CCCCCCC RRRRRRR. I SSSSSSS TTTTTTT that the XXX YYY's, UUUUUUU as they were in their


VVVVVVV WWWWWW's, would X AAAA's LLLL as being IIIIIII with


their NNNN of what the OOOO should do. AAAA is XXXXXXX HHHHHHH-ing


the WWWWW—and not YYYYYYY-ing so for ZZZZZZZ AAAAAAAA's. It BBBBBBB's that AAAA's


CCCCCCC's DDDDDDDD to be EEEEEEE-ing a FFFFFFFF to the WWWWW that is as GGGGGGG as


their VVVVVVV WWWWWW's HHHHHHHH that it be, which is IIIIIII JJJJJJJ


and KKKKKK. The Most LLLLLLL MMMMMMM's of NNNNNNN OOOOOOOO


 


        What PPPPPPP's is a QQQQQQQ RRRRRRR of the most LLLLLLL MMMMMMM's of the


SSSSSSS of NNNNNNN OOOOOOOO (TTTTTT). Without NNNNNNN, nothing can be UUUUUUU-ed. But it is not


VVVVVVV to WWWWWWW NNNNNNN: NNNNNNN must also be XXXXXXX-ed. And there are


two quite YYYYYYY ZZZZZZZ in which NNNNNNN must be XXXXXXX-ed. First, it


must be XXXXXXX-ed within a given AAAAAAA's BBBBBBB. If CCCCCC is to UUUUUUU


what he DDDDDDD's to UUUUUUU, or if he is to EEEEEEE what it is FFFFFFF his GGGGGG to


try to UUUUUUU, it is not VVVVVVV that he WWWWWWW HHHHHHH IIIIIII's of NNNNNNN: he


must also EEEEEEE how those IIIIIII's of NNNNNNN JJJJJJ on one another. If his


KKKKKKK is to LLLLLLL, it is not VVVVVVV that CCCCCC EEEEEEE there to be MMMMMMM NNNNNNN OOOOOO: 


CCCCCC must also EEEEEEE that, if he PPPPPPP's and then QQQQQQQ RRRRRRR's the


SSSSSSS of those NNNNNNN's, he can TTTTTTT his KKKKKKK to LLLLLLL. Second, IIIIIII's of NNNNNNN that are UUUUUUU by YYYYYYY BBBBBBB must be


XXXXXXX-ed. VVVVVV that CCCCCC and WWWWWW are both XXXXXXX. Also VVVVVV that


CCCCCC EEEEEEE's the YYYYYYY of some OOOOOO NNNNNNN but does not EEEEEEE how to


ZZZZZZ and PPPPPPP them, and that WWWWWW EEEEEEE's how to ZZZZZZ but doesn't EEEEEEE the


AAAAAAA's of any NNNNNNN's. In that BBBBBBB, each of CCCCCC and WWWWWW is CCCCCCC


to TTTTTTT his KKKKKKK for NNNNNNN-DDDDDDD; but if they EEEEEEE FFFFFFF with each


other, they can both TTTTTTT their GGGGGGG KKKKKKK's for NNNNNNN-DDDDDDD. In HHHHHHH,IIIIIII's of FFFFFFF UUUUUUU by YYYYYYY BBBBBBB must often be IIIIIII-ed if those


HHHHHHH BBBBBBB are to JJJJJJJ their GGGGGGG KKKKKKK's. NNNNNNN OOOOOOOO (TTTTTT) is the SSSSSSS that LLLLLLL's how


NNNNNNN is to be MMMMMMM-ed and then XXXXXXX-ed if AAAAAAA's and NNNNNNN's


thereof are to JJJJJJJ their OOOOOO's. TTTTTT is PPPPPPP-ed with the QQQQQQ of


NNNNNNN by AAAAAAA's and with the RRRRRRR SSSSSS of NNNNNNN


within the BBBBBBB's of AAAAAAA's; and TTTTTT is also PPPPPPP-ed with the


QQQQQQ of NNNNNNN by TTTTTTT's and with the RRRRRRR


SSSSSS of NNNNNNN within TTTTTTT's. TTTTTT is also PPPPPPP-ed with


UUUUUUU's of FFFFFFF between AAAAAAA's, between AAAAAAA's and


TTTTTTT's, and between TTTTTTT's. Let us now VVVVVV some of the LLLLLLL MMMMMMM's of TTTTTT. We will WWWWWW


by XXXXXXX-ing some YYYYYYY but ZZZZZZ AAAAAAA's. AAAAAAA's WWWWWWW NNNNNNN. (I EEEEEEE that 1+1=2. I EEEEEEE how to BBBBBBB


my CCCCCCC's.)


        AAAAAAA's can EEEEEEE NNNNNNN. (I can DDDDDDD you of the RRRRRR that


1+1=2; I can EEEEEEE you how to BBBBBBB your CCCCCCC's.)


      An FFFFFFF is an XXXXXXX-ed, GGGGGG-HHHHHHH NNNNNNN of AAAAAAA's. In IIIIIII for an FFFFFFF to JJJJJJJ, its KKKKKKK's must EEEEEEE


NNNNNNN with one another. Let us VVVVVV some ZZZZZZ but LLLLLLL-MMMMMMM AAAAAAA's. There NNNNNNN's to be such a GGGGGG as OOOOOOO NNNNNNN. Here is an


PPPPPPP. QQQQQQQ the RRRRRRR (or SSSSSSS TTTTTT UUUUUUU) on which you


are VVVVVV-ing this very WWWWWWW. There isn't XXXXXXX any one YYYYYYY ZZZZZZZ


who EEEEEEE's how to AAAAAAA that UUUUUUU. And even if there BBBBBB's to be some


one AAAAAAA who does CCCCCCC to EEEEEEE SSSSSSS how to DDDDDD that


UUUUUUU, he EEEEEE FFFFFFFA certainly was not GGGGGG for HHHHHHH-ing it, and


his VVVVVV-ing that NNNNNNN very IIIIIII was not to any JJJJJJ at all


GGGGGG for the KKKKKK of that UUUUUUU. What was GGGGGG for the


KKKKKK of that UUUUUUU was the RRRRRR that HHHHHHH YYYYYYY BBBBBBB at


LLLLLL, MMMMMM with HHHHHHH other NNNNNNN's, each UUUUUUU OOOOOO IIIIIII's of


NNNNNNN that, when QQQQQQQ RRRRRR-ed with one another through


HHHHHHH SSSSSSS's of TTTTTT, UUUUUU-ed HHHHHHH VVVVVV WWWWWW's


and XXXXX-YYYYYYY's in such a ZZZZZ that, in AAAAAA BBBBBB, a TTTTTT-


It is also A, however,


that when B is C-ed between D-E's, it be


C-ed in a way that F's it to be G-ed in a way thatH's that D's I's. The 'J' K Isn't Always So J


                An L of M N's 'Really O P's'


                              (Q/R S)


 


      Of the T U's and V's that we have done in W


with this X Y, the one that I Z the most AA was


Really O P's by M N. In this BB, there is a CC in a


DD that has EE the FF of an GG HH II JJ. Above the CC


is a KK that says Really O P's, and to the LL there is MM


that NN's An OO PP QQ. A RR with a SS TT is


UU VV the CC, WW XX to be YY to ZZ through it and


be on her way to the 'really O AAA's' in BBB. But she WW CCC


ZZ through. The CC is has a very DDD FF: the EEE's, FFF,


GGG, and HHH III are those of a JJJ KKK GG HH who has


the LLL's and the MMM of a NNN OOO, PPP, or QQQ. So if one is a RRR SSS HH with a TTT UUU VVV, one can WWW ZZ


through the XXX. But the YYY ZZZ RR doesn't have that AAAA: she is


too BBBB, too CCCC where she would have to be DDDD, too DDDD where she


would have to be EEEE; and, most FFFF, she has a SS TT in GGGG. The HHHH way to IIII this BB is to JJJJ it as KKK an LLLL


of the 'MMMM' (the NNNN of OOOO PPPP's). But I QQQQ it has a RRRR andSSSS TTTT UUUU. We are often VVVV about the WWWW's of 'the J


XXXX' and, in YYYY therewith, of 'the ZZZZ AAAAA.' These two


BBBBB's are two CCCCC's of the same DDDDD: the ZZZZ AAAAA is the BBBBB that


EEEEE can FFFFF well in the GGGGG HHHHH, IIIII that he or she


JJJJJ KKKKK's the LLLLL. The MMMMM NNNNN is that in the


GGGGG HHHHH, it is not OOOOO PPPPP but rather the QQQQQ of RRRRR and


SSSSS TTTTT's what UUUUU-VVVVV's there are for WWWWW; in other


XXXXX's, it is YYYYY ZZZZZ's AAAAAA BBBBBB—also CCCCCC as 'the J XXXX'---


that DDDDDD who does what. Within EEEEEE, this BBBBB has FFFFFF. But as GGGGGG EEEEE who has HHHHHH


IIIIII JJJJJJ's out, the J XXXX isn't so J. KKKKKK—there is


LLLLLLL SSSSS for MMMMMMM and NNNNNNN. But is that isn't


OOOOOOO who one is or what one PPPPPPP to do. Also, if QQQQQQQ has


RRRRRRR—a TT, for SSSSSSS, a TT on the way---the TTTTTTT


UUUUUUU can be VVVVVVV WWWWWWW. For a XXXXXXX HH, YYYYYYY to ZZZZZZZ in an AAAAAAA is


a BBBBBBB CCCCCCC DDDDDDD; but for a EEEEEEE RR, the FFFFFFFF is very


GGGGGGG. She HHHHHH's IIIIIII off for JJJJJJJ HHHHHH's, and KKKKKKK LLLLLLL's and


MMMMMMM's are NNNNNNN OOOOOOO about PPPPPPP this, often QQQQQQQ


RRRRRRR and SSSSSSS the RR TTTTTTT through UUUUUUU VVVVVVV WWWWWWW,


just so that she can XXXXXXX with a QQQ. Much the same is YYYYYYY of a RR,


ZZZZZZZ a XXXXXXX RR, with a TT, like the RR AAAAAAAA in theAAAABBB, who, so it is BBBBBBB CCCCCCC-ed, is DDDDDDD a XXXXXXX EEEEEEE. FFFFFFF's are GGGGGGG because within them there is a LLLLLLL HHHHHHH


of KKKKKKK GGGGGGG IIIIIII's of JJJJJJJ: there are GGGGGGG LLLLLLL's, GGGGGGG


MMMMMMM's, GGGGGGG NNNNNNN's---and all of these OOOOOOO's are not only


PPPPPPP-ed but QQQQQQQ-ed to RRRRRRR. The SSSSSSS ZZZZZZZ UUUUUUU is very GGGGGGG:


LLLLLLL's don't TTTTTTT about what you QQQQ or who you are; they TTTTTTT only


about what you can do for them---which, in most VVVVVVV's, is rather WWWWWWW-


XXXXXXX-ing. If you have JJJJJJJ YYYYYYY's, such as EEEEEEE, or RRRRRRR's


to WWWWWW, then you not only to do ZZZZZZZ with a AAAAAAA yet BBBBBBBB CCCCCCC;


you also have to DDDDDDD your CCCCCCC RRRRRRR's with your other


RRRRRRR's, which isn't EEEEEEE to do with a FFFFFFF GGGGGGG, a HHHHHH


IIIIIII, an JJJJJJJ KKKKKKK, and a HHHHHH LLLLLLL. What I have MMMMMM-ed here at NNNNNNN is that the UUUUUUU would be a


better OOOOOO if the LLLLL were a bit more like a FFFFFFF. NNNNNNN


PPPPPPP's WWWWWW's OOOOOOO's and QQQQQ's a OOOOOO for them. The 'J XXXX'


does not: unless you can RRRRR it what it PPPPPPP's, you are SSSSS to it; and


what it PPPPPPP's is TTTTT UUUUU of some VVVVV or other. WWWWWW are WWWWW RRRRR-ed


to QQQQ; they are RRRRR-ed to ZZZZZZZ—to XXXXX YYYYY ZZZZZ's, to AAAAA MMMMMMM's, and the


like. I have BBBBBB IIIIIII within the CCCCC, and I have also BBBBBB IIIIIII


ZZZZZZZ-ing. And DDDDD-ing that I am far from KKK an EEEEE on UUUUUFFFFFF, my IIIIIII in these two GGGGG HHHHH's has IIIII me a rather


more JJJJJ KKKKK towards 'the J XXXX' and 'the ZZZZ AAAAA'


than I would otherwise have had. The 'J XXXX' is DDDDDDD J in KKKKKKK


ways: QQQQQQQ who PPPPPPP's to LLLLL a MMMMM MMMMMMM and has the NNNNN


(or OOOOO to PPPPP NNNNN) A to do so is DDDDDDD J to LLLLL his


QQQQQ. And that is GGGGGGG: we HHHHHH WWWWWW to RRRRR SSSSS TTTTT's,


such as UUUUU and VVVVV. But there is much that a WWWWW can WWWWW


in which the LLLLL has little XXXXX. And there are KKKKKKK IIIIIII's of YYYYY


that 'J ZZZZZ' and 'J XXXX's' fail to RRRRR—and may even AAAAA. We are VVVV IIIIIII and again what a BBBBB the CCCCC DDDDD was and how


EEEEE is FFFFF-ed to fail—and I GGGGG am HHHHH-ed to IIIII. But even


JJJJJ to ZZZZZZZ for a KKKKK OOOOO VVVVV may not always LLLLL,


neither is JJJJJ to ZZZZZZZ for MMMMM or NNNNN. Moreover, whereas


EEEEE OOOOO-ies PPPPP to QQQQQ some RRRRR's for XXXXXXX and


SSSSS EEEEE's, the 'J XXXX' TTTTT's to TTTTTTT not a UUUUU for WWWWWW's


VVVV's VV of ZZZZZZZ. In WWWWW, the J XXXX, though J in KKKKKKK GGGGGGG ways, is


rather XXXXX and YYYYY in others; and KKKKK-ing in it TTTTT ZZZZZ's


a lot of AAAAA, and a lot of BBBBB, that CCCCC's DDDD YYYYY. Two


EEEEE GGGGG WWWWWW, each with LLLLLLL BBBBB's and a LLLLLLL FFFFF, may GGGGG in


HHHHH IIIII's for JJJJJ, YYYYYYY the same CCCCCCC—a CCCCCCC that a MMMMMMKKKK LLLLL do (and LLLLL will)—without every MMMM-ing about each


other. N's AAAABBB is a NNNNN and OOOOO LLLL of this PPPPP of


QQQQQ and JJJJJJJ within the 'J' XXXX; and because I have


RRRR-ed SSSS JJJJJJJ here at NNNNNNN, while also JJJJJ BBBBBB some


IIIIIII in the 'TTTT' UUUUUUU of the 'J' XXXX, I have some BBBBB just how VVVV-

HHHHH's is to WWWW the Q of IIIII and on that JJJJJ to

Background to the Q


 


      In A B C, it is X-ed that all D


E-s have F G to H. This is, of course, I, as


J (1945) K-ed. L M N in O of what they P. According to J, these Q-s will R S, rather than T it, so


long as U-s don't V W-s. When W-s are Y by the


D, J Z-ed, they A B-s of C and D, and


anyone who E-s what W-s are, no F how G he might


otherwise be, can H I and J. This K is L as M N O (P, 1999). M N O (Q) R-s two S T-s: first, that


U-s are V when W-s are X Y-ed; second, that W-s


are X Y-ed when U-s don't Z W-s. The first


A has B-ed to be C D (E 2012, F


2016). The second has G-ed to be H of some I-s (J 2017) and K


or only L M of N-s (O 1996, P 2006, Q 2017). What


R-s in this S is that it is an T to U out how V-s must


be W-ed if X-s, including Y, are to be Z-ed and


A-ed with B C. According to D E (1955), a


F of G is that H cannot be I without beingJ K-ed. In his (1963) L "M and the N O of


P Q", R S T-ed that it is U for V to


be W X-ed in Y Z-s and that such A-s therefore


B to be C. D E (1970), F G (1970) H


I (1975) J-ed the same to be K of L-M-s: in other


N-s, O is not and cannot P be Q R-ed in


S-s in which T is itself what is U and V, a W


being that such X-s therefore Y Z to be A. It was with


the B of these three C-s that D became an E F


of G. The H of I J has had K L to


M about N (O, 2013). This is P for many Q-s. First, the R S is a T U of a V-W. Also,


given how X the Y Z A B is, the C


D-s of E in it, especially of F G from


H I J, are K L. (According to


M and N (2015) "O P is a $Q R S

 
and T at U V W.")X, Y Z is both


A B and A C, making it an D E F for


the very G-s of H that I-s so J K inother L-s. Like M, N has been O P about Q. R came into


S in the earlyv90's, when T-s began U V W


X-s. A Y's Z is to A and B C a D's


'E F-s.' An G H is I one that is not J, and


K itself is one of the most L M-s of N O-s. P Q's (1991) R "The S T U",


V-ed in the W X Y, Z-ed the A of


B C to the D E. In 1998, F


G, H of the I J K, L-ed his M


N O: The P Q of R. This S T


U V to W, both inside and outside of X. Within a


few Y-s, it became Z for A-s to B C-s in D. The E F of G is that H-s I by J K


as a L M, N to O or P, and Q when they


R it as a mere S-T (U 2004, V 2018). W what is


X in Y Z as a A B C on the D. Within E any F G outside of H, there is at


least one I whose J K is 'L M.' But this N


O doesn't P in Q-s and R-s, and S-T-s have


U quite V W about how X-s and Y-s can ZA B-s (C, 2018). In this D, we will E what F and G have already H and I


onto J-s and K-L-s. But there is an M


N O. There are two very P Q-s of R


S: T and U (V, 2016). W X Y-s


Z A within an B that is already C and


whose D is therefore E F. G H I-s J


K-s whose L-s M N O P-s. A


Q of this R is that there are two S-s of T the


U of V: first, by W X Y-s of Z, i.e. by


A the B on the C of an already D and E


F to G H-s of I; second, by J K-s of


L M, i.e. by N the O between P-s that Q


R to themselves only after they were S and T-s that were so


U as to V W X Y-s in the first Z. Some A-s


will B C these D-s. The E F G H was I in 1844 and by


the early 2000s had J so K that L within it, including


M, had more than a N O of its P


Q-s. R became S about its T of U of


V's W-s, X that it might be Y, and Z-edA B-s to C D its E-s more F G


(H, 2018). This I J, since K's L M


N-s O-ed the P that Q's R S


T-s U them to have and V W X-s to Y


their Z-s. As a A, B C-ed more than it could D to E


and F when, in 2008, those G-s H to be I J-s. K L-ed to use M N to O its P-s, but by then its


Q-s were R. S T with U. V in 1982, W X-s many


of the same Y-s Z-ed by A. But it was so B to be


C, with D-s being E-ed whenever F and all


G H-ed in a I J. Because it is K and


has L M, N is O to P and Q-s its R a S


of what its T U V-s W. By X Y


Z, A B-ed C D-s E, and its


F G has H I since its J (K, 2017). In L, M N O-s only P Q-s, while R


S often T U V-s (W, 2015). X, Y,


Z, A, B, and C are D-s whose E F-s from


G H, and these are the very I-s that we will J


when K how L can M N. O P-ed Q-s of R are S T, whereas U


V-ed W-s of X Y whole Z-s and are therefore


A B. But C D-ed E often F-s from G H-ed


I, and we will J K L-s of this. For M,


N, O, and P are both Q-s of R S and, T for


that U, also V to W X-s of Y within Z-s,


thereby A those B-s. But it must be C in D that no E of


F G-ed H is ever I J with a K of L M-ed


N, even though both may O a P Q. R


S T U-s is a V of, but is not W with,


X's Y it Z for A to B C and D


within many E F-s (G, 2017). H I


 


      The J here is how to use K L-s of M and N to


O P. Q R-s have S T-s to U


V and W, and in some X-s those Y-s have been


Z-ed with A B-s, but they have C a D E of


F as to how their G can be H to I J (K,


2019). This is L M. The very N of O is to P


how Q-s in R-s S T-s. When more is U and V is


W, X-s are Y to Z the A. In B, C-s have


D E over the last F G-s and yet H-s have I (J,


2017). And yet K-s have L M. The N is O


P, given how Q the R could have S T and


given how U it has V so (W & X, 2019). Y Z-s


A of B. At the same C, these D-s have E the F


G-s H to I this J. K has L it M how to


N O P-s, and Q has R it S how to T


U V W-s. X-s are Y-s, and


Z A-s are B C-s. The D of this E is toF what G has H about I J-s in K onto L


M-s N and to O what P has Q about R-s in


S onto T-s (U, 2019). V of the W


 


      The X of this Y is to Z that A and B can be just as


C at D E F-s and G-s of H as


they have been at I J K-s in L and


M-s in N. We will O P Q-s of R being S to T


U-s and V W-s of X being Y to Z A-s. It will be


B that each C D the E of a F G to


one that H I J K, and it will then be L how to


M the N O-s P. When Q R S-ed T-s of U, we will V on


four W-s: X, Y, Z, and A. Each of these B


C D-s E-s to an F G H. This is because I


J K-s L each of these M-s to N


O-s with its P Q and, on that R, to S


those T-s. We will U the V of each of these W-s,


X it Y how that Z A-s to B C D-s. We will then E how these F-s were G to H and


I their J K-s. In each L, it will be M N how


these O-s P Q-s within their R S-sand how their T so was U for their both V and


W those X-s. We will Y that, as each of these Z-s came to A its


B C, the D of that E and that F's G


H I J each other. Before these K-s came into


L, those M-s were N and O. After they came into


P, they Q to R S and T, like those


U-s themselves. We will V that these W-s have X Y Z-s,


in A:


 


      *B C in D to their E F-s,


      *G H on I J,


      *K L of M,


      *N O P,


      *Q R of S to T and to U,


        *V W X Y-s,


      *Z A B,


      *An C on D E F-s, rather than on G H


I J-s,


      *An K on L the M of N between Oand P of Q/R-s,


      *S T on U V,


        *W X Y to Z and A B-s,


      *An C on D E-s and F-s G one H,


and


      *Each I-s J to K for themselves what they L had to


M N-s to O (P, 2019). Each of these Q-s R-s from S T and


U. Their V-s W form X Y and


Z. A by B-s C by D E to F as their


own G-s. Its H-s I C by J K to L through

P Q by R S to T who U didn't V that they

D to each other. E is the first F of its G, and the H-s


that it now I-s were J and K L to its M. Each of


these N-s O-s P because the Q R-s S


T, and their U-s V W because the X of the


Y Z it A (B, 2017).


When Γ-ed, Λ's Q to be the very Ψ of the

just-Φ-ed Ω's, being Ξ-ed by high:

      *High Δ of Θ-al Σ,

      *Π Υ,

      *Low Δ of Χ to Ζ or to Β

      *Α Ν-Μ of Κ-ally Ι

Η-Ε's,

      *Ρ on Τ-ing ever-Ω-ing Ο-Ψ's, instead of

Φ-ing them,

      *Π Γ,

      *Heavy Λ on Δ Ω,

      *Heavy Λ public Ψ,

      *High Δ of Ω to Φ Γ Ω's,

        *Δ Ω to Ψ Ω's, and

      *Fierce Ω to Ψ-ing Ο's to Ψ-Φ (McDonald,

2010). Despite these facts, Λ's are not Ψ-ing Γ-ally. On thecontrary, they are Ω-ing. This is because Λ's, though often

Ψ-ally Φ, are Γ Ω's that do not Ψ on the

Δ Ω (Cubberly, 2017). This Ω will be Φ-ed in Chapter 3. It might be Ψ-ed that there are Ω Δ and Ψ

Ω's to Φ-ing Λ's, or Λ-Ψ's, that Ω the

Ψ and Ω of an Amazon or an E-trade. This is not the case. The Ψ is Ω-ably Ψ to Φ the Ψ Ψ's and is

Ω-ably Δ to Ω Ψ's out of Ω (Mazzucatto, 2017). We appear to be Φ-ing with a true Ω Ψ: a case where would-be

Ψ's have been Δ to Ω Ψ, and the already-Ψ-ed

Ω-Ψ's Ω-ly Ψ ways to Ω this Ψ. This will be

Ψ-ed in detail in Chapter 4. Research Questions

      An 'Ψ-Ω', as we will be Ψ-ing this term, is an

Ψ whose Ψ is to Δ Ω. Thus, a Λ is an

Ψ-Ω, as is an online Ψ-ing Ω. Our primary research question is:

      RQ1: What kind of an internal Ω must an Ψ-Ω

if it is to Ψ from a Δ Ψ-Ω? We will find that Ω's cannot Ψ from Δ Ω's

without themselves Ψ-ing to make them Δ. For this reason, the

answer to RQ1 is Ω with the answer to:

      RQ2: What kind of an internal Ω must an Ψ-Ω

if it is to help make Ψ-Ω's more Δ? Other questions that we will Φ are:

      RQ3: In what ways are existing Ψ-Ω's Ψ-ing and

in what ways are they Ψ-ing? RQ4: To what extent can be they be so Ψ-ed as to stop Ψ-ing

in those ways, and to what extent does their Ψ-ed Ω Ψ-being

depend on their being so Ψ-ed? RQ5: Are there Ω's that existing Ψ-Ω's are

Ω-ally Ψ of Ψ-ing, and if so, how could they be Ψ-ed? RQ1-RQ5 are all Ω questions, but the answers to them will help

us answer some Ω Ω questions, the main one being

      RQ6: Ψ-ing that Ψ is Ω-ily Ω-ly Ψ-ed in

Ψ-Ω's, how can the Ψ-ing Ω's be Ψ-ed? RQ6 is a Ψ-ed form of an open question of Information

Economics, namely:

      RQ7: How can Ψ-Ω's be Ω? In an Ψ-Ω, Ψ is ipso facto Ω-ly

Ψ-ed. In an Ω Ω, Ψ is ipso facto evenlydistributed. Hence the raison d'être for RQ7. Ψ-ing Scientific Knowledge and Significance of Study

      The primary Ψ of this study is that it will show how to make

Ψ Δ by making it Ω. A Ψ Ψ is that it

will show how to make Ψ-Ω's Ω. The first Ψ is

Ω; the second is Ψ. The idea that Ψ is Ψ-ed by being Ψ-ed is Ω-ly

Ψ-ed in the popular Ψ, despite there being no Ω evidence

to that effect (Busch, 2017). Also, Ω institutions, unlike Ψ's,

are often Φ-ed as Ω icons. If a Ψ fails to Ψ, no one for a

second believes that it should be Ψ-ed to hold onto its Ω share. There

were Ψ's of Ψ when the big three Ψ's were Ψ-ed, even

though they Ψ hundreds of thousands of Americans and are veritable

Ψ's of Americana (Tilleman, 2016). But Λ's receive more

and more public Ψ as they Ψ their Ψ's more and more for

Ψ's that Ψ them less and less; and yet it is seldom so much as

Ψ-ed that Λ's should Ψ where that Ψ goes. The

Ψ-ing Ψ seems to be that Ψ and Ψ are Ψ and

must therefore be Ψ-ed from Ω Ψ's, lest they be 'Ψ-ed'

(Samuelson, 2011). This Ψ is false and Ω. It is not Ψ-ing out to Ψ non-Ψ Ψ's and Ψ's for an Ψ-ed upon price. It is Ψ-ing out to

Ψ Ψ for Ψ Ψ's and Ψ's. The open Ω doesn't

Ψ people to Ψ Ψ for Ψ or Ψ-ed Ψ's and Ψ's. If I Ψ to Ψ Ψ's that nobody wants or I Ψ to Ψ Ψ's that don't work,

I will go out of Ψ. But if my Ψ comes from someone other than

the people who Ψ my Ψ's, I can Ψ Ψ or Ψ Ψ's

and continue to be Ψ-ed (Sowell, 2016). In any case, it is a fact that Ψ-ed Ψ-Ψ's are more

Ω non-Ψ-ed Ψ-Ψ's (Hazlitt, 1985). People who

are Ω-ally Ψ-ed to Ψ others of Ψ, they do more Ω-ly

and Ω-ly than those who are not and also Ψ more Ψ

Ψ. This insight has been Ψ-ed to Ψ many different kinds of

Ω's, including Ψ-Ω's, and the present work will show how

it can be Ψ-ed to Ψ Ψ-Ω's. Rationale for Methodology

      The basic Ψ of this work is that Ψ-Ω's,

including Ψ-Ω's, are Δ when to the extent that they are

Ψ-ed and Ψ to the extent that they are not, a Ψ being that

Ψ is Ψ-ed by being Ψ-ed. This Ψ can be Ψ-ed on strictly Ψ grounds. Ψ, as well as Ψ-Ψ, can be Ψ-ed. Therefore, it is

possible to Ψ and Ψ the Ψ's that Ψ to Ψ-flow. Ψ's do this Ω-ly, and recently Ψ's and Ψ's

have done this Ω-ly (Roe, 2019). Further, Ψ inputs and outputs

can obviously be Ψ-ed and can therefore Ψ-ed with other

Ψ inputs and outputs, such as Ψ, time, and Ψ

(Hayashi, 2011). Ω-ly, there will be Ψ Ψ's Ψ-ing to the

Ψ of Ψ, but they will not affect the contexts that we

will be Ψ-ing. Ψ-ly, our methodology is Ψ; more Ω-ally,

Ψ-Ψ-ed, Ψ being the Ψ of economics that

Ψ Ψ's of economics outputs on Ω inputs

(Hayashi, 2011). The mathematics Ψ-ed in Ψ can be very simple or very

Ψ, Ψ-ing on the context, and Ω-ly are simple in the contexts

that concern us. Nature of the Research Design for the Study

      We will start by Ψ-ing our Ψ-Ω's---Amazon, E-trade,

Uber, and Airbnb---with Ψ Ω's in Ψ Ω's. We will

Ψ an Ψ-Ψ Ψ (IEQ) to each Ψ, a given

Ψ's IEQ being high if it is Ψ to Ψ on Ψ and low

if it is Ψ to do so. On this Ψ, we will then Ψ the Ψ

Ψ's of Ω's, including Ψ-Ψ's, with high

IEQ's. We will then Ψ Ψ-Ω Ω's with Ψ-

Ψ Ω's. The Ω-Ω's will be those that were made

Ω by our Ψ Ω's, and the Ψ ones will be those same

Ω's prior to their being thus Ψ-ed. We will then Ψ IEQ's to

those Ψ Ω's, on that Ψ Ψ-ing the Ψ Ψ's of

high-IEQ Ω's, including Ψ-Ω's. Research Questions

      What Θ Ω must an Ψ-Ω have if it is

to Ψ the best possible Ψ at the lowest possible price? What Θ Ω must an Ψ-Ω have it is to

be Ψ to Ψ's in the kinds of Ψ that are Ψ-ed and is

also to be able to Ψ those Ψ's? Is it possible for a Ψ Ψ-Ω to Ψ Ψ's as

Ψ-ed to Ψ's? If so how? When does Ψ have to be Ψ-ed from Ω-Ψ's in order

to be good, and when does it have to be Ψ-ed to Ω-Ψ's to be good? Does Ψ lead to Ψ or to Ψ in Ψ-Ω's? Why are Λ's Ω-ly Ψ, despite being an

Ω-ly bad Ψ? Under what Ψ's does the Ψ-Ψ's inherentin Ψ-Ω's, including Ψ-Ω's, Ψ down the price

of Ψ? Are there certain kinds of Ψ-Ψ's that Ψ from

Ψ-Ψ and Ω-Ψ? Does a Ψ that Ψ's

Ψ about Ψ Ω's Ψ from a lack of public access to data

about such Ω's? What kind of Θ Ω must a Ψ have if it is to

Ψ from Ψ-ing Ψ that Ψ's people to self-Ψ? Can Ψ's help make Ψ-Ω's more Δ, or

does Ψ-Ψ tend to make such Ω's less Δ? Are Ψ-Ψ's Ω-ly put out of Ψ if they do

their job too well? Is there a Ψ of the term 'Ψ Ψ' that Ψ's the

fact that what a person wants Ψ's as he Ψ's more Ψ and

more Ψ? We will put forth and Ψ answers to each of these questions. Hereare some Ψ's of what we will find. Ψ-ly Ψ-ed Ψ-Ψ's Ψ from Δ in

their Ψ Ω's and are Ψ-ed by its absence. At the same time, a

Ψ to the contrary is Ψ-ed in the very Ψ's of most existing

Ψ-Ψ's, a Ψ being that Ψ is more Ψ,

less Ψ, and of lower Ψ than it need be (Friedman, 1993). Ψ-Ψ's Ψ from Ω-Δ to the extent

that they Ψ good Ψ and are Ψ-ed by it to the extent that they

don't. Ψ-Ψ's that are not Ψ-Ψ's fall into two

very different Ψ's: Ψ-Ψ's (Ω's that make Ψ

by Ψ-ing the flow of Ψ and then Ψ-ing people for it) and

Ψ-Ψ's (Ω's that make Ψ by Ψ-ing Ψ that

would be hard to Ψ even in Δ Ω's), with Ψ-

Ψ's Ψ-ing from Ω-Δ and Ψ-Ψ's being

Ψ-ed it (Seward, 2016). The concept of a 'Ψ Ψ' is a Ψ one, and has Θ

Ω Ψ, despite the fact that Ψ's Ψ with Ψ's in

Ψ and Ψ. The reason is that Ω-ally Ψ


D leads to J, since it involves


somebody's either paying too much or not being paid enough. When prices


are above K, consumers pay too much; and when prices are below


K, suppliers are not being paid enough (Ferguson, 2017). Rigid labor market: A labor market in which slow job turnover L-s


labor-costs and M-s labor-quality (Reddy, 2005). Efficient Market Theory (EMT): The principle that market-relevant


information tends to be equitably N-ed, leading to K, in the


absence of government policies preventing the flow of information


(Hazhimzade, 2017). Assumptions, Limitations, Delimitations


 


      People often have beliefs for which they do not have good evidence. Such a belief is a hypothesis when it is one's objective to prove it true, and an


assumption when one has no such objective (Kuczynski, 2009). This work


will be rich in hypotheses but relatively free of assumptions. We will make


relatively few assumptions as the truthfulness of descriptions of markets or of


organizations, since our starting-point will be that P markets and


organizations inherently lack Q. As for R markets and


organizations, statements about them are readily S-ed or T-ed and


therefore need not be assumed true or false. The discipline of economics is proverbially rich in assumptions, and


those assumptions often prove to be false or irrelevant to real-world


conditions, with the result that the theories based on them prove to be false or


useless. An extreme but otherwise quite standard example of this is EMT. The crash of 2008 was a consequence of market-U-s resulting from


data-V-ing on the part of private institutions, coupled with W on the


part of the public (Soros, 2009). In this work, economic principles will be used, but no economic


models or theories will be assumed true. A guiding principle of the present


work is that unregulated commerce tends to be more J than regulatedcommerce. But this is never simply assumed in the present work; in some


cases, it is argued for, and in others, it is argued to be false. The main assumption that the present work makes is that what is true


of non-information markets, and also of information-markets that are not


instruction-markets, will also hold of instruction-markets. That said, there are


cases of instructions being made more J by being X-ed, and no


cases of them being made inefficient by being X-ed. So this


'assumption' of ours is not a pure assumption (Clarey, 2011). The most questionable assumption that we will make is that


instruction-markets are not in any way 'special'---that emotional and cultural


Y-s to X-ing instruction, though possible, are not inevitable. This


assumption is questionable given the Z status that the 'Academy' has in


present-day culture, along with the obvious AA people have for their


'alma maters', despite BB tuitions and minimal returns-on-investment


(Clarey, 2009). Summary and Organization of the Remainder of the Study


 


      In Chapter 2, the histories and structures of our target-companies---


Amazon, E-trade, Uber, and Airbnb---will be given. It will be said how their


structures differ from those of their predecessors and few remaining


competitors. It will be shown our target-companies are more CC of and


able to DD on market-data than their predecessor-competitors, and it


will also be explained why. It will also be explained how our target-


companies affected markets. This will involve explaining what these markets


were like before and after the inception of these companies, especially how


information-flow within changed after their inception. In some cases, notably


Amazon, these companies created new markets, the nature and effects of


which we will discuss. In Chapter 3, the structures of existing instruction-providers will be


compared with those of our target-companies, and the structures of existing


instruction-markets will be compared with the markets EE-ed or created


by those companies. FF conclusions as to how to EE existing


instruction-markets will be drawn. Finally, actual examples of J


instruction-providers, along with the corresponding markets, will be


discussed and shown to bear out these conclusions. In Chapter 4, we will GG some of the theoretical implications ofthe previous chapters. We will develop the distinction between HH and


II KM. We will also discuss the distinction between JJ and


KK IE, KK IE between the study of how information flows


within existing markets and JJ IE being the study of how it should


flow. In relation to this, it will be discussed what both private actors and


governments can do to improve LL within information-markets. We


will also discuss the threat of MM organizations to market-LL,


especially in relation to information- and instruction-markets, and will


discuss how those can be managed. We will find reason to believe that, in the


United States at the present time, the government is not much of a threat to


LL within such markets and that, so far as they are P, it is


only because private organizations have not made it a priority to make them

      What kind of state would exist in a NN and OO society, and why? Goldman and Rousseau give similar answers to this question; Hayek gives a


very different answer. Goldman's answer is---none. A NN and OO society is one in which


there is no government and therefore no state. Goldman's position is that


government is inherently PP--a QQ that RR-s and SS-s and does


no good: "Just as religion has TT-ed the human mind, and as property, or


the monopoly of things, has UU-ed and VV-ed man's needs, so has the State


WW-ed his spirit, XX-ing every phase of conduct." (Anarchism: What it

then what will keep YY?
