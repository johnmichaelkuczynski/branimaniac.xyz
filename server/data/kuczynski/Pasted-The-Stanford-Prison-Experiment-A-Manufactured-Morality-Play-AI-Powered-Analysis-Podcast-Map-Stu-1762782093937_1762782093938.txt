Abstract

The Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE) has been enshrined for half a century as social psychology's great revelation about power and cruelty. In fact, it was an under-designed psychodrama whose data were negligible and whose cultural afterlife rests entirely on narration, not evidence.

1. Myth over method

Philip Zimbardo's 1971 study purported to show that ordinary individuals, randomly assigned to act as guards and prisoners, would internalize their roles and become sadistic. Yet virtually no experimental control was exercised. The "guards" were prompted to be harsh, the "prisoners" knew they were expected to suffer, and the experimenter himself played warden, contaminating observation with performance.

2. The footage itself

Even if one brackets the later revelations of coaching, the surviving video is strikingly underwhelming. What one sees is not depravity but pantomime—college students shouting, enforcing push-ups, staging petty humiliations. No sustained aggression, no credible brutality, no sign of spontaneous moral collapse. By any realistic measure of human cruelty, the conduct barely registers. The "data," such as they are, would fail any minimal behavioral-science threshold for magnitude.

3. Why institutions love it

The SPE survives because it serves a moral and pedagogical function. Universities and corporations screen the movie to perform a ritual of self-critique: look how terrible authority can be—somewhere else. It allows genuinely hierarchical systems to congratulate themselves on their enlightenment while reproducing coercion in the classroom. The experiment is a morality play disguised as science.

4. Conclusion

The enduring lesson of the Stanford Prison Experiment is not that "power corrupts." It is that narrative, when sanctified by authority, can corrupt inquiry itself. The most revealing data lie not in the basement of Stanford's psychology building but in the fifty years of credulous repetition that followed.
