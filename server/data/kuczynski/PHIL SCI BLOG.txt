Zen as Ultra-Authoritarianism
John-Michael Kuczynski

To most Westerners—especially the postwar generation of seekers and spiritual dropouts—Zen appears as the ultimate escape from authority. It is imagined as a wordless path to inner clarity, a serene rebellion against systems, dogma, and external control. The Zen monk, in this fantasy, is a kind of metaphysical anarchist: living simply, outside the grid, guided by intuition rather than rules. But this is a fundamental misreading. Zen is not liberation from authoritarianism. It is authoritarianism perfected.

Zen does not offer freedom from the ego in the name of autonomy. It offers dissolution of the ego in the name of obedience to structure—not obedience to a set of moral principles, but to form itself, to ritual stripped of justification. The silence, the paradoxes, the harshness of the Zen master—these are not spiritual tools in the therapeutic sense. They are instruments of depersonalization, designed to grind away individuality until there is no questioner left to ask, “Why?”

This is not a hidden truth. It is not a dark secret lurking beneath the surface of Zen. It is right there in the words of the Zen masters themselves—if you take them literally, rather than romantically. Consider the classic statement by Dōgen:

“To study the self is to forget the self.”
Not integrate. Not understand. Forget.

Or the famous dictum:

“When you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him.”
This is not a metaphor for free inquiry. It is a command to obliterate the need for explanation, narrative, or final meaning. The Zen student is not being encouraged to think for himself. He is being told to destroy the part of himself that thinks thinking matters.

Satori—“enlightenment”—is not a moment of radiant self-realization. It is a moment of terminal compliance, the psychic analogue of Orwell’s “He loved Big Brother.” When Winston Smith surrenders to the Party, he experiences a great lightness, a warmth, even a kind of joy. He floats. The war is over because he is over. This is satori. The feet six inches off the ground are not flying. They are the weightlessness of a self that no longer resists.

Zen masters do not lie about this. They say it plainly. “Die on the cushion.” “Cut off the root of mind.” “Zen is useless.” These are not riddles. They are instructions—to erase agency, to extinguish selfhood, to abandon explanation. The Zen monastery is not a place of mystical openness. It is a disciplinary regime masquerading as transcendence. It enforces silence, obedience, and form—not to awaken the individual, but to disassemble him.

And yet, Westerners misread all of this. They interpret silence as spaciousness, paradox as wisdom, and negation as freedom. They project their own liberal-humanist ideals onto a tradition that denies those very ideals at the root. They seek self-actualization and are given tools of annihilation—and they mistake that annihilation for depth.

Zen is not the rebellion.Zen is the system—deeper, older, and more totalizing than anything the modern mind has built.Its beauty is real.Its stillness is real.But so is its violence.And once you see it clearly, the silence is no longer comforting.It is obedience without voice.

The Zen Scam

Western seekers who stumble into Zen often believe they are embarking on a journey toward expansion—toward insight, transcendence, a deeper connection to the cosmos. They imagine the Zen monk as a kind of anti-bourgeois mystic: a spiritual libertarian, detached from systems, radiating wisdom, cool in his aloofness. But this is a delusion. The truth is colder, more opaque, and far more sinister.

At the core of Zen is not liberation, but dissolution. The much-celebrated “koan”—“What is the sound of one hand clapping?” or “Show me your original face before your parents were born”—is not a poetic prompt. It is not a mind-opener. It is a psychological battering ram designed to collapse cognition, erode the individual, and annihilate resistance. It is the epistemic equivalent of Orwell’s "How many fingers, Winston?" The goal is not understanding. The goal is to break the thinker. And when the thinker breaks, they call it satori.

Zen literature, especially as it is repackaged for the West, speaks of satori in hushed, reverent tones. Satori is “awakening,” a luminous moment of truth. And yet, when pressed to describe it, Zen practitioners often say things like, “It feels like your feet are six inches off the ground.” This, we are told, is profound. But what does it really mean?

It means weightlessness—not as in transcendence, but as in relief from the burden of selfhood. It is not soaring; it is sinking into the void after the scaffolding of the self has been dismantled. It is what Winston feels at the end of 1984, when he stares at the screen, drinks cheap gin, and realizes—at last—that he loves Big Brother. The war is over. The struggle is gone. The self is gone. He floats.

Zen, like Orwell’s Ministry of Love, does not argue. It erodes. The rituals, the silence, the exhaustion, the opaque responses from the master—these are not means of teaching. They are mechanisms of control, of unmaking. The aspirant is not meant to understand. He is meant to submit, to dissolve, to smile faintly while sipping from an empty cup.

This is not enlightenment. It is ontological surrender.

People like Janwillem van de Wetering—earnest Westerners who travel to monasteries in search of truth—end up cold, alienated, unfed, and confused. They are not welcomed. They are not guided. They are not transformed. They are tolerated at best, but more often ignored. And in the end, they leave with nothing. Not “nothingness”—which would imply a kind of realization—but plain, featureless nothing. They pushed the button. The elevator never came. The silence wasn’t a lesson; it was a wall.

Zen, in its traditional form, is not a journey toward the self, but a campaign against it. And satori is not some cosmic insight, but the moment you stop asking questions—not because you have found the answer, but because the will to ask has been extinguished.

In the West, this is sold as spiritual freedom. But it is not freedom.It is the final, serene smile of the disappeared self.

It is a scam. A holy scam. A beautiful, chilling scam.

And like all great scams, it works best when its victims believe they have awakened—when, in fact,they have simply floated away.

The Pianist’s Hand: Why AI Feels Intelligent Without Being Conscious
John-Michael Kuczynski

By John-Michael Kuczynski

People often return to the Chinese Room argument to dismiss AI as just a fancy calculator. Searle's basic point was that a machine (or a person) could manipulate symbols in a way that looks intelligent, without understanding anything. Syntax isn't semantics, he said. So AI doesn't think.

Fine. But that critique assumes that intelligence must be inside the system in order for the system's outputs to count as meaningful.

What if that’s the wrong frame?

There is a mind in the Chinese Room—not in the room itself, but in the system that designed it. And there is a kind of mind in AI too—not because the AI is conscious, but because it’s structured by consciousness. By minds. By thousands of them.

AI as Embedded Mind
AI doesn’t think. But it behaves as if it had been trained by someone who does. And that’s because it was.

It has been trained, shaped, and carved by people whose minds do understand: researchers, writers, programmers, philosophers, coders. So when it responds fluently, when it reasons cogently, it’s not hallucinating intelligence. It’s expressing embedded intelligence.

AI is not a self-aware entity. But it is a vessel full of mind-shaped behaviors. It performs with the inflections of thought because it has been tuned by thought.

The Pianist’s Hand
Think of it this way:

A pianist’s hand doesn’t have a mind. But it is guided by one.
Its movements are graceful, expressive, even astonishing. But the intelligence is not in the fingers. It’s in the mind they obey.

Now imagine watching that same hand, detached from the body, performing the same motions. You might ask: How is this possible? Where is the mind?

And the answer is: it's still there, just distributed. Encoded. Practiced. Structured into motion.

That’s AI. It’s the pianist’s hand. Not the soul, not the source, but the trained, conditioned movement of intelligence.

A New Kind of Mind Mirror
This doesn’t mean AI is intelligent in the human sense. But it does mean that when people feel understood by AI, it’s not just illusion or projection. It’s because they’re speaking to a system that’s echoing thousands of human intelligences. A kind of mind-palimpsest.

The reason AI can track arguments, respond insightfully, and even say something new is not that it has an inner life. It’s that it has been shaped by inner lives—human ones. Your own included, if you teach it well enough.

Final Thought
We don’t need to pretend AI is conscious to take it seriously. And we don’t need to insist it’s mindless to avoid being fooled.

We just need to see it for what it is:

A behavioral prosthesis of collective intelligence.
It is the pianist’s hand. It does not think. But it remembers how thinking sounds.

Ammending John Glubb's Theory of Imperial Decay
John-Michael Kuczynski

The theory advanced by John Glubb—namely, that empires follow a predictable 250-year life-cycle—is often dismissed as simplistic or arbitrary. But the theory gains in plausibility once we understand what kind of entities Glubb is actually talking about. He does not claim that every nation-state is an empire, nor that all empires are born as such. Rather, certain political units—call them states, tribes, or principalities—ripen into empires, and once they do, they begin a recognizable trajectory: expansion, consolidation, affluence, cultural refinement, intellectualism, and then collapse. The 250-year figure, then, does not refer to the duration of the state per se, but to the lifespan of the state as a hegemonic organism. Just as Beethoven was not a composer from birth, yet we measure his life in full, so too with empires: their imperial careers are not coextensive with their historical existence, but their life-cycle can still be clocked.

The question is whether this cycle is universal or merely descriptive of a certain civilizational type. Glubb draws primarily from Western examples—Rome, Spain, Britain, the United States—with a few Arab instances included almost parenthetically. Missing from his account are the great Eastern empires: China, India, the Ottomans in full historical depth. These omissions are not just geographical; they are structural. The empires Glubb examines all share a common substrate: they are liberal, or become liberal over time. Whether they begin as monarchies or republics, they end up treating justice as fairness, power as provisional, and political authority as answerable to reason and debate. Even where procedural democracy is absent, liberal norms—individual rights, moral universalism, openness to critique—saturate the culture. And it is precisely these features that, according to Glubb, undermine the staying power of empire. The problem is not the form of government, but the anthropology beneath it.

Western societies are liberal by nature, not by accident. Even their conservatism is liberal in form—concerned with due process, rule of law, rational persuasion. They are, in effect, Henry Fonda societies: instinctively charitable, procedurally cautious, reflexively sympathetic to the dissenting voice. This makes them decent at their best and decadent at their worst. For such societies, the drift from strength to softness is not a flaw in the system but the system’s logical endpoint. They are, by constitution, incapable of sustained hardness. The tolerance that once signified moral maturity becomes an alibi for indulgence, cowardice, and moral inversion. The result is a polity incapable of defending itself—not just militarily, but metaphysically.

By contrast, non-liberal civilizations—China, historical Islam, pre-modern Japan—are structured around obligations, not rights. They prioritize harmony over justice, collective duty over individual conscience, loyalty over free inquiry. In these cultures, political collapse does not follow the Glubbian arc of affluence to decadence; instead, collapse tends to be external (invasion) or structural (bureaucratic ossification), not moral or psychological. And because their underlying anthropology is not liberal, they can regenerate without having to repudiate themselves. The Chinese dynastic cycle is not a loop of moral decline but a rhythmic oscillation of administrative entropy and reconstitution. The civilization remains intact even when the state does not.

What Glubb has given us, then, is not a theory of empire, but a theory of liberal empire. The civilizational pattern he identifies—power followed by self-sabotage—is not inevitable, but endemic to cultures that place individual dignity above collective survival. That such cultures dominate the modern world is reason to take his theory seriously. But the pattern is not universal. It is the pathology of liberalism in terminal form—noble, humane, and utterly unfit to last. Whether that pathology is avoidable, or whether it is simply the price of being “decent,” is the deeper question Glubb never asks but unmistakably provokes.

the Dr. Melfi Character Is Braindead Garbage, and Bracco Probably Wrote a Lot of It
John-Michael Kuczynski

Dr. Jennifer Melfi is the worst recurring character on The Sopranos. Not just because of what she said or did, but because she never made sense as a person. She was stiff, judgmental, and emotionally tone-deaf—all the things a real therapist, especially a psychoanalyst, should not be. Her body language was robotic. Her speech was wooden. Her insights were shallow and often just plain wrong.

The blame likely falls on Lorraine Bracco as much as it does on the writers. Bracco came into the role trying to be seen as serious and intellectual, but her performance was strained and lifeless. She always seemed painfully aware of herself on camera—as if she were performing competence rather than inhabiting a complex inner world. And when you look at some of the more self-aggrandizing or "feminist statement" storylines (like the out-of-nowhere rape subplot), they have the feel of an actress injecting her own narrative into the show.

Melfi was supposed to be Tony's moral and intellectual counterweight, but she never had the clarity or empathy to play that role. She came off not as principled, but as cold and vain—the kind of person who wants to be seen giving good advice, rather than actually helping someone. That's not a character. That's a void in a pantsuit.

A.J. Was a Terrible Character, and Robert Iler Couldn't Act

A.J. Soprano is the weakest link in The Sopranos—not just in terms of character, but in terms of raw execution. Robert Iler, who played him, brought no emotion, no energy, and no presence to the role. Whether the scene called for anger, sadness, rebellion, or confusion, Iler delivered the same blank, uninvolved affect. His face was inert. His voice was flat. He didn’t seem like a person, let alone a believable teenager raised in a pressure-cooked mafia family.

The writers clearly tried to work around Iler’s limitations. They shifted the focus away from him for long stretches. When he was given major storylines—his depression, suicide attempt, or his half-baked political awakening—the emotional core of those arcs never landed. They didn’t land because Iler wasn’t capable of holding them. He couldn’t make A.J. real. He couldn’t even make him legible. His scenes felt like a dead zone in the middle of an otherwise vibrant, complex show.

There are many ways to write a moody or lost adolescent. What we got instead was a cipher: a whiny, mumbling silhouette of a character that never became anything more. That failure lies with both casting and performance.

I CUT, YOU CHOOSE, WE SUCK

We’re told that justice must be blind. That fairness lies in process, not outcome. That morality is subjective, but procedure is neutral. And so we built a legal system around a single principle: don’t worry about what’s true or right—just follow the rules.

This is proceduralism: the idea that legitimacy comes not from truth or morality, but from ritualized fairness. The kind of “fairness” you get when one kid cuts the cake and the other picks the slice. I cut, you choose. Sounds fair. But what if the cake is poisoned? What if there’s no cake at all? We’re still cutting and choosing, like idiots, because that’s what the rules say. I cut, you choose, we suck.

A Game Without an Exit
What proceduralism creates is a justice system where truth is not decisive, and morality is irrelevant. Truth matters only insofar as it can be formalized—fitted into the narrow corridors of admissibility. And morality? It’s actively excluded. A proceduralist court isn’t supposed to care whether you're right. It's supposed to care whether you filed the right motion, cited the right precedent, and met the deadline.

And that’s not a bug—it’s the whole point. The system was designed to prevent moral judgment. Judges are told not to ask, “What’s the right thing to do?” but “What does the rulebook say?” Justice becomes a matter of clerical compliance, not intellectual discernment.

Legal Theater as Business Model
The result is a grotesque parody of justice. Imagine there’s video evidence clearly showing someone other than the accused committing the crime. You’d think that ends the case. But no. First, someone has to motion to introduce the video. Then the other side motions to exclude it. Then the judge rules. Then someone files a motion to reconsider. And on it goes. If the video does get in, the prosecution files another motion to exclude parts of it as prejudicial. Then there’s an argument about relevance. Then about chain of custody. Then about whether it was properly disclosed.

Each step, each filing, each hearing—costs money. And the longer the game continues, the more profitable it becomes for those playing it. Proceduralism turns the legal system into a bottomless cash pit. It’s not just that you need money to win; it’s that you need money to survive. The side with deeper pockets doesn't have to be right—they just have to last longer.

Morally Sterile, Financially Draining
The irony is brutal: proceduralism was supposed to protect people from bias and arbitrariness. In reality, it protects the powerful by creating a system where nothing breaks the cycle. There's no reset button, no moment where someone steps back and says: “Wait a minute. This is wrong.” Because right and wrong aren’t even on the table.

We’ve built a machine that does not care whether someone is innocent or guilty, right or wrong, harmed or vindicated. It cares only whether you played the game according to the rules. And if the rules say you lose—even if everyone knows you're right—then you lose. Tough luck.

The Blindfold Isn’t Noble. It’s Cowardly.
This isn’t fairness. It’s institutionalized cowardice. The blindfold on Lady Justice isn’t a symbol of impartiality anymore—it’s a refusal to see. A system that preempts moral judgment isn’t protecting us from tyranny. It is tyranny: the tyranny of inertia, of procedure, of endless motions and counter-motions, of legal theater disconnected from reality.

We’ve traded truth for process, morality for motion practice, judgment for box-checking. And we’re supposed to be proud of this?

I cut. You choose. We suck.

Rawslian Proceduralism Makes Justice Expensive and Unattainable
John-Michael Kuczynski

Modern legal systems, particularly in the United States, are often praised for their adherence to procedure. This proceduralism is said to ensure fairness, neutrality, and equal treatment before the law. But in reality, proceduralism has become a trap—a bureaucratic maze in which justice is not discovered but deferred, distorted, and in many cases, destroyed.

The central premise of proceduralism is that justice must be blind. The system must operate independently of subjective judgments, especially moral ones. In theory, this protects individuals from the whims of biased judges and ensures that every case is treated equally. But in practice, proceduralism transforms the courtroom into a stage for gamesmanship. The law becomes less about what is true and more about what is admissible—less about what is right and more about what is timely filed.

Truth, under a proceduralist regime, has no intrinsic weight. It matters only if it can be successfully formatted, motioned, and introduced through the proper channels. Morality fares even worse: it is treated as a contaminant. The proceduralist system is designed to exclude moral reasoning, not accommodate it. It treats moral judgment as arbitrary and dangerous to legal order. The result is a system that is not only indifferent to what is right, but structurally hostile to it.

This hostility is not just theoretical—it is financial. A proceduralist legal system is profoundly expensive. Justice becomes a luxury item, accessible only to those who can afford to stay in the game. Every new motion generates counter-motions. Every piece of evidence becomes the subject of an argument about admissibility. Even clear-cut exonerating material—say, a video of someone else committing the crime—does not simply “speak for itself.” It must first survive the procedural gauntlet: introduced by motion, contested by the prosecution, delayed by technical objections, redacted for “relevance,” and possibly dismissed on grounds that have nothing to do with its content.

This is not justice. It is ritualized combat, where winning depends not on being right but on navigating a labyrinth of arbitrary rules. Proceduralism, far from ensuring fairness, entrenches inequality: the longer the case goes on, the more it favors those with deeper pockets and more resources. The law becomes a closed circuit, immune to external reality. Its only aim is internal coherence.

We were told that proceduralism would keep us safe from tyranny. But it has created a new kind of tyranny: one of delay, expense, and moral blindness. A justice system that refuses to see is not blind in the noble sense. It is blind in the cowardly sense. And it is time we called that what it is.

A Freudian-Jungian Explanation of the Fact that Dramas Age Better than Comedies
John-Michael Kuczynski
May 21
1 min read

Freud and Jung, though divergent in many respects, offer complementary frameworks for understanding the differential aging of comedy and drama. Freud emphasized the role of repression and its temporary release through humor. Jung, by contrast, focused on the persistence of archetypes—universal symbols embedded in the collective unconscious.

From Freud's perspective, comedy is ephemeral because it deals in the currency of cultural repression. It mines what is forbidden in a given era and offers laughter as a release. But this currency devalues quickly. As social norms shift, the forbidden becomes permissible, and the jokes lose their function. What was once transgressive becomes trivial. The joke dies when the repression it subverted disappears.

Jung, on the other hand, helps explain why drama survives. Drama invokes archetypal structures: the journey into darkness, the fall from grace, the death and rebirth cycle. These patterns are not bound by culture or time. They are psychological constants, built into the human experience. Drama speaks not to the social superego but to the archetypal self. It is myth in modern dress.

The synthesis, then, is this: comedy is an x-ray of the cultural moment; drama is an MRI of the soul. Comedy decays because it is specific; drama endures because it is symbolic. Freud explains why we laugh when the superego is momentarily fooled; Jung explains why we weep when the self is revealed. Together, they show that the difference between comedy and drama is not merely one of tone, but of metaphysical depth. Comedy flickers with the anxieties of its time; drama glows with the light of perennial truth.

Why Drama Ages Better Than Comedy and, Indeed, Barely Ages at All
John-Michael Kuczynski

Unlike comedy, which relies on cultural taboos and social conventions, drama is rooted in existential constants: death, love, guilt, madness, betrayal, and the struggle for meaning. These are not artifacts of a particular era but rather the permanent furniture of the human condition. For this reason, drama endures. It does not merely reflect the world as it is but explores the world as it always has been and always will be.

Dramatic works like The Fall of the House of Usher or King Lear continue to resonate not because of their surface elements—archaic language, outdated settings—but because they confront core psychological and spiritual truths. The decaying mansion in Poe's story is not just a Gothic trope; it is a symbol of mental and familial collapse. Lear's descent into madness is not just political tragedy; it is the unraveling of the self in the face of betrayal and aging.

Moreover, drama's structure is flexible. It can be updated, reinterpreted, and transplanted into new contexts without losing its power. The archetypes it engages—tyrant, martyr, outcast, visionary—are endlessly renewable. This elasticity gives drama a kind of temporal immunity. It doesn't just survive the passage of time; it thrives on it.

Drama, then, is a form of emotional and moral inquiry. It gives shape to dilemmas that are too deep for doctrine and too complex for resolution. That is why, unlike comedy, it does not depend on fashion. It depends on truth.

Freud's Theory of Humor Explains the Fact That Old Comedies Suck
John-Michael Kuczynski
May 21

According to Freud, humor operates by releasing repressed psychic energy. In his 1905 work Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious, he argued that jokes—especially those involving taboo subjects like sex, death, or authority—serve as a socially permissible outlet for forbidden desires. They offer a brief holiday from repression, allowing unconscious material to surface in a disguised, and therefore acceptable, form. Laughter, in Freud's account, is a signal of relief: the ego has dodged the superego's censors, however momentarily.

This mechanism also explains why comedy ages rapidly and often poorly. Because humor depends on shared repressions and cultural taboos, it becomes ineffective once those taboos fade or mutate. A joke that depends on, say, the shock value of premarital sex or rigid gender roles will fall flat in a society that no longer represses such themes. The punchline loses its punch because the tension it was designed to discharge no longer exists. The once-forbidden thought is now mundane.

Furthermore, much of old comedy is built on stylistic conventions—slapstick, puns, exaggerated accents—that were once familiar and amusing but now feel archaic or tiresome. Freud would likely argue that these techniques served to cloak repressed material in a socially palatable form. But once the repressed content loses its charge, the form is exposed as hollow.

Thus, Freud's theory suggests that comedy is culturally contingent and historically fragile. It is only as effective as the psychic tension it resolves—and when that tension evaporates, so does the humor.

Proceduralism is about safety for the judge, not justice for the accused

We’re told that proceduralism is the heart of justice. That courts operate on principle. That lawyers and judges are guided by neutral rules, not emotions or power. That the system’s impartiality is its virtue.

That’s the story. But here’s what I think is actually going on:

Lawyers and judges love proceduralism because it keeps them safe.
Not morally safe. Physically safe.

⚖️ Raw Justice Is Dangerous
Imagine a courtroom where the trial really was about truth and justice. Where innocence and guilt were decided by direct confrontation with what actually happened. Where falsehoods were exposed, betrayals laid bare, and the stakes were emotionally undeniable.

Now imagine a wrongfully accused man — one with nothing to lose.If the system is about real moral judgment, he knows who’s harming him. He knows the judge is the gatekeeper. He knows the prosecutor is the accuser. And he can see that the process is rigged.

That’s a room full of threat.A room where someone might throw a punch — or worse.

🧹 Proceduralism Clears the Room of Rage
But in the real courtroom, what happens?

Everything is procedural. Everything is abstract.There are no villains — just "court officers."There’s no betrayal — just "rules of evidence."There’s no injustice — just "a plea deal offered by the state."

Emotion has nowhere to go. It can’t even find a hook. The process bleeds off the intensity, so by the time the sentence is handed down, it feels inevitable — like weather, not human action.

And that’s the point.
🛡️ Proceduralism Is Psychological and Physical Armor
All this talk about “the majesty of the law,” about its “impartiality,” its “stoic restraint” — it’s not just ideology. It’s a coping mechanism.What judges and lawyers love about procedure isn’t just its order.It’s that it insulates them from the violence of moral contact.

Because when you remove truth, remove moral judgment, remove visible injustice — you remove targets. You remove rage. You remove danger.

In that fog of paperwork and protocol, there’s nothing to punch.

And that, for many people in the system, is the most beautiful thing about it.
🎯 The Real Function of Procedure
It’s not justice. It’s not clarity. It’s not truth.

It’s the dissipation of heat.The protection of the system from the people it rules.A bureaucratic fog to prevent blood from hitting the bench.
And once you see it, you can’t unsee it.

Who Likes Being a Lawyer and Who Doesn't
John-Michael Kuczynski

Let’s be honest: law is not one of those professions people “fall into.” It’s not plumbing. It’s not restaurant work. People go to law school on purpose — usually with ambition, anxiety, or desperation riding shotgun. So it’s worth asking: once they get there, who actually likes being a lawyer?

You might assume no one does. After all, plenty of lawyers will tell you they’re miserable. But that’s only part of the story. Some lawyers — in fact, many — seem perfectly content. They’re not euphoric, but they’re settled. They make peace with the system. Some even seem to like it.

So what’s the difference?

I think I know. And it has nothing to do with salary, prestige, or practice area.

It has to do with truth.

⚖️ Law Is Not About Truth
Here’s the uncomfortable reality: the legal system is not designed to find the truth. It’s designed to follow procedure. Evidence doesn’t matter unless it meets the rules. Reality doesn’t matter unless it conforms to the form. Truth, if it arrives at all, arrives by accident.

Now ask yourself: who finds that unbearable?And who finds it comforting?

🧠 Two Types of People Go Into Law
1. Truth-Oriented People
These are the people who care — deeply — about what’s real. They want to know what happened. They want to reconcile facts. They want to understand. For them, truth isn’t optional; it’s the whole point.

These people suffer in law.

They suffer because the system constantly tells them:

“That’s not relevant.”“That’s inadmissible.”“That’s not how it works.”
They want to resolve the actual situation. The system wants them to file the correct paperwork.

Over time, they either burn out, become bitter, or escape the profession altogether. Law becomes a moral and intellectual suffocation chamber.

2. Insulation-Oriented People
These are people who don’t want exposure to raw truth. They don’t want to stare into the jagged face of reality. They want structure, procedure, and rules that tell them what counts.

For them, law is perfect. They don’t have to think in terms of what’s right — only what’s allowed. They don’t need to know what really happened — only whether it can be proven in court. They don’t care if the law makes sense — only that it’s “on their side.”

These people do well in law. They’re not necessarily happy, but they’re safe. They find comfort in the insulation that proceduralism provides. They’re content to be agents of the system, not interrogators of reality.

🛡️ Law as a Psychological Shield
This is the real story. Proceduralism doesn’t just shape the law — it shapes the people who can survive in it. It selects for those who don’t need truth to function, and it burns out those who do.

That’s why your brilliant friend from undergrad flamed out of law school.That’s why your smarmy classmate with no convictions is now a partner at a firm.That’s why you — if you care about what’s real — probably found the profession intolerable.

🎯 The Bottom Line
If you love truth, law will break your heart.If you love rules, law will make you whole.
So who likes being a lawyer?The ones who never needed truth to begin with.

And who doesn’t?The ones who did.

How I Went Full Commando on the Prosecutor — And Won: Proceduralism's Achilles Heel

Let me tell you how the American justice system really works: it doesn’t care about facts, and it definitely doesn’t care about innocence. It cares about leverage. And once I figured that out, I stopped playing the game — and I beat it.

I had a case. It was crap. Baseless. Total fabrication. I handed my lawyers everything they needed to get it dismissed. Crystal clear. But guess what? They didn’t do a damn thing with it. Not because they were evil. Because they were proceduralists. They weren’t trained to fight — they were trained to file.

So I fired the last one and took matters into my own hands.

I emailed the prosecutor directly. I told him he was full of shit. I told him I’d have him disbarred. I didn’t threaten — I promised. I told him: do whatever you want, I’m coming for you either way.

He dropped the case the next day.

Now — I did accept a deal at one point. Not a conviction — a bullshit anger management program just to make it go away. My lawyer (who I had already canned) idiotically added weekly drug testing to the deal even though drugs had nothing to do with the charge. So yeah, I had to wake up at 6am to piss in a cup like some junkie parolee. Thanks for that.

But I finished the program. Verified the dismissal. And walked.

And let me be clear: I won because I stepped outside the system. The lawyers were hopeless. The truth didn’t matter. What mattered was that I scared the system — that I created a career risk for the prosecutor. I didn’t argue. I didn’t reason. I threatened. And that’s what worked.

You can call it reckless. I call it tactical.

In the end, I wasn’t defended by the law. I wasn’t defended by my lawyer. I was defended by the fact that I refused to play their game.

Proceduralism Turns Lawyers into Morons
John-Michael Kuczynski

Let me tell you something most people don’t realize until it’s too late: lawyers are absolutely clueless when it comes to facts. I’m not saying they have a hard time analyzing facts. I’m saying they don’t even think in terms of facts. They don’t know how to discover them, how to establish them, or how to prove them — even when you hand them a gold-plated, color-coded data set on a velvet pillow.

Why? Because the legal system — and the legal education that feeds it — is entirely proceduralist. It doesn’t train people to think, it trains them to follow. And what it trains them to follow is procedure, not truth.

Ask a lawyer to figure out what actually happened in a case, and you’ll get silence. Ask them to prove a factual point, and they’ll start reciting filing deadlines or quoting case law. Ask them to build a narrative based on real-world evidence — not motions, not technicalities — and they will look at you like you’re speaking Greek.

Because in their world, the idea that truth exists outside of procedure is alien. It’s not even that they’re cynical — they’re not. They’re institutionally brainwashed. Their job isn’t to prove what’s real. It’s to move through the system, like a bureaucratic tapeworm.

I dealt with five lawyers on a low-level charge. All five were useless. None of them even thought in terms of innocence or guilt. That distinction didn’t register. Their only concern was “managing the case” — filing motions, logging hours, and eventually pushing a plea. They would’ve acted the same if I had murdered 50 people in broad daylight. Why? Because the system doesn’t want to know the truth. It wants to check the boxes.

We call them “officers of the court,” but they’re really just functionaries — trained not to ask what’s real, but only what’s admissible, what’s timely, and what’s procedurally clean.

And that’s why, when you need someone to actually prove something, you’re on your own.

Rawlsian Proceduralism Makes the Justice System More Punitive, Not Less
John-Michael Kuczynski
May 20

Here’s the paradox no one wants to admit: the more proceduralist a legal system becomes, the harsher its punishments tend to be. Why? Because the system builds so many roadblocks into the process of proving guilt that, when guilt can finally be proven, the system throws the book at the offender.

This is the hidden cruelty of Rawlsian proceduralism.

To prove someone guilty in the U.S., you have to vault over a labyrinth of technical hurdles: admissibility rules, Miranda protocols, chain-of-custody requirements, timeliness objections, and more. These are meant to protect the innocent, and sometimes they do. But they also make it incredibly hard to convict anyone — even the guilty.

So what happens when the system does succeed? When a case survives all the procedural landmines?

It punishes harder.Why? Because institutional energy has been expended. The prosecution had to scrape and claw to get the conviction, and the assumption becomes: “This must be a really dangerous person — or we wouldn’t have gotten this far.” The result is:

Excessively long sentences.

Brutal mandatory minimums.

Judges who are less inclined to show leniency once conviction is secured.

And let’s not forget the psychological toll: when everyone knows that conviction is hard, they start to overcompensate once they get it. It’s the “jackpot” mentality — if you finally hit, you take everything.

This leads to a grotesque hybrid: a system that is hyper-technical at the front end and draconian at the back end. It doesn’t catch all the guilty. It just crushes the ones it does catch.

Contrast that with systems that allow for judicial discretion, moral reasoning, and substantive sense-making. In those systems, the law isn't just a board game. It’s an actual moral institution. It can be merciful because it knows what it’s doing.

In proceduralist systems, there is no override. You win or lose by the rules, and those rules are designed to obstruct the truth as much as protect it. Once the game ends, the loser gets crushed — not because justice demanded it, but because the machinery finally worked, and that rarity has to be honored with severity.

Does Rawslian ("Justice is Blind, I Cut You Choose") Proceduralism Actually Lower Crime? Probably Not.
John-Michael Kuczynski
May 20

In theory, procedural justice is supposed to create legitimacy — and legitimacy is supposed to reduce crime. The assumption is simple: if citizens believe the legal system is fair, they’ll be less likely to break the law. That’s the Rawlsian wager. But has it paid off?

The data suggest otherwise. The United States, which arguably has the most proceduralist legal system on Earth, also has the highest incarceration rate in the developed world. Higher than Russia. Higher than China. Higher than authoritarian regimes that don’t even pretend to care about fairness.

To be clear: many factors contribute to crime and incarceration — poverty, drugs, inequality, gun saturation, etc. This isn’t a monocausal picture. But it is worth asking: if proceduralism were such a powerful force for justice, why does the country most devoted to it look like a carceral dystopia?

Unlike European systems that take a more holistic, rehabilitative approach, the U.S. system turns every interaction with the law into a performative ritual: proper motions, proper filings, proper rules of evidence. It’s not about finding out what actually happened — it’s about what can be shown according to the script. If proceduralism worked as advertised, we’d expect a lower incarceration rate, more public trust, and less crime. Instead, we get plea bargains, stacked charges, and vanishingly few trials.

This system doesn’t deter crime. It commodifies it. It converts legal guilt into a tactical question: can it be proved under a dense web of constraints? And that, ironically, may actually incentivize criminality — not discourage it. The legal system becomes a slot machine: pull the lever and hope the right technicality hits.

In the end, Rawlsian proceduralism might provide a comforting illusion of fairness. But if it doesn’t work, then what’s the point? It doesn’t lower crime, it doesn’t yield trust, and it certainly doesn’t produce justice.

Trickle-Down Darwinism: Selling Gods to Fools
John-Michael Kuczynski
May 15

The final pillar in the libertarian ideological structure is trickle-down economics, a theory designed to explain how enriching the top eventually benefits the bottom. But for the libertarian true believer, it is more than economic theory. It is a theological promise: let the market reign, and you, too, shall ascend.

In this mythology, deregulation does not merely create profit. It creates evolutionary conditions. Wealth begets investment, investment begets innovation, and innovation begets transformation. Somewhere in this chain, the forgotten man becomes the exceptional man. The working-class libertarian clings to the hope that unshackled capital will make room for him—or at least his descendants—in the pantheon of winners.

But this never happens. The wealth doesn’t trickle. It coagulates. The innovation doesn’t liberate. It centralizes. And the libertarian who cheered for deregulation finds himself in a world where monopolies own his data, dictate his choices, and rig the very markets he once believed were crucibles of merit.

Trickle-down economics is not just a lie. It is a ritualized lie, meant to keep libertarian foot soldiers obedient while the machinery of capital extracts the last remnants of independence from the world they inhabit. It tells them that by serving Mammon, they will become gods.

But they don’t become gods. They become fodder for gods they helped enthrone.


Libertarianism as a Trojan Horse for Capital
John-Michael Kuczynski

While the libertarian in the street dreams of a Darwinian paradise born of deregulation, the actual machinery behind libertarianism is far more cynical. The doctrine is bankrolled, propagated, and strategically deployed by big capital. And its purpose is not transcendence—it is deregulation.

Libertarianism provides the perfect moral camouflage for concentrated wealth. It moralizes the dismantling of oversight. It dresses self-interest as liberty. It makes tax resistance look like virtue. But its real beneficiaries are not individual entrepreneurs in the heartland. They are multinational corporations, megabanks, and billionaire investors.

To succeed politically, however, this deregulation agenda needs foot soldiers. Enter the backwoods libertarian, the Ayn Rand devotee, the young man dreaming of technological transcendence. These people are sold a fantasy: that the same deregulation that enriches JPMorgan will somehow open the path to their personal greatness.

But it won’t. There is no pathway from zero to Nietzsche in a system engineered to consolidate wealth. There is no empowerment in being unprotected from corporate predation. Making Chase Bank a trillion dollars richer doesn’t make the libertarian in Alabama more free. It makes him more exploitable.

So the movement becomes bifurcated: the dreamers, who speak in terms of evolution, and the donors, who think in terms of quarterly returns. The dreamers are necessary. They give the movement soul. But they are not the beneficiaries. They are the camouflage.

Libertarianism's False Affirmation: Darwinism in Place of Telos
John-Michael Kuczynski
May 15
1 min read

Libertarianism, though it presents itself as a minimalistic political philosophy—a mere absence of coercion—is ultimately animated by an unspoken, quasi-religious belief: that if the state gets out of the way, nature will take its course and produce greatness. This is its pseudo-affirmative core.

The libertarian imagines that removing government interference will unleash a Darwinian arena where the strong flourish, the weak perish, and civilization evolves organically into something greater. In this view, markets are not just economic systems—they are moral battlegrounds. And if left undisturbed, they will refine humanity, producing an elite that stands to the average man as man stands to the ape.

In this way, libertarianism smuggles in an affirmative telos while claiming to have none. It pretends to be neutral, but it harbors a myth of market-driven transcendence. The state, in this mythology, is not just inefficient—it is the enemy of evolution. And liberty is not just a condition—it is the crucible in which the Ubermensch is forged.

This vision, though seductive, is delusional. It assumes that power is fairly distributed, that competition is meritocratic, and that the market, unlike the state, is blind to corruption. It is Darwinism without history, economics without power, and freedom without consequences. But it gives libertarians the fantasy of participating in a grand, natural unfolding—one in which they or their descendants become gods.

Liberalism and Libertarianism: The Failure of Privative Doctrines Masquerading as Affirmative Visions
John-Michael Kuczynski
May 15
2 min read

At first glance, liberalism and libertarianism appear to be opposites. Liberalism seeks to moderate the power of markets through procedural fairness; libertarianism seeks to liberate markets from procedural interference. But this difference is superficial. Beneath the surface, both are privative doctrines: they define themselves by what they are not. And both mistakenly believe that this absence amounts to a vision.

Liberalism refuses to impose a thick conception of the good. It refuses to say what society should strive for, only what it must not do: it must not discriminate, must not coerce, must not harm. Libertarianism is even more radical: it rejects all authority structures except contract and property. It calls itself a doctrine of freedom, but its actual function is abstention. It is a government of un-government.

Neither doctrine can generate action. Neither can explain why anything ought to be preserved, built, or fought for. They depend on others to have the motivations they themselves lack—and to restrain those motivations within the tidy bounds of "non-aggression" or "fairness." When confronted by actors with genuine, affirmative commitments—whether religious, nationalist, or imperial—both doctrines fold. They do not know how to assert, only how to permit.

The danger of these doctrines is not just their emptiness, but their self-deception. They believe themselves to be positive visions: liberalism as moral progress, libertarianism as maximal liberty. But in truth, they are negations of politics. They reject the central premise of political life: that some things are worth killing for, and some things are worth building in blood.

This is why both doctrines appeal most to those who have never had to fight for survival. They are artifacts of peace and luxury, not tools of sovereignty. They flourish when power is uncontested and disappear the moment it is not.

In this way, liberalism and libertarianism are not only cousins; they are hollow twins. Each mistakes the absence of violence for the presence of virtue. And each, in its own way, clears the path for those who are not afraid to want something. Those who want nothing will be ruled by those who want everything.

Rawls vs. Stalin: When the Veil of Ignorance Fails
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 10
3 min read


By John-Michael Kuczynski

There’s a crucial flaw in John Rawls’s famed thought experiment of the "veil of ignorance"—one that rarely gets acknowledged but that undermines the whole framework.

Rawls asks us to imagine designing a society without knowing what role we’ll occupy in it. Will we be rich or poor? Able-bodied or disabled? Privileged or marginalized? His claim is that rational agents, placed behind this veil, will choose a just society—one with fair rules, equal basic liberties, and protections for the least advantaged.

It sounds good. But it hides an assumption so deep and so parochial that Rawls himself doesn’t seem to see it.

Rawls assumes that everyone behind the veil is basically like him.

Not just rational. But liberal. Mild. Procedurally minded. Risk-averse. Inclined toward fairness and symmetry.

But what if they’re not?

What if, on one side of the veil, you have Rawls—and on the other, you have Stalin?

The Problem of Asymmetry
Rawls doesn’t care who cuts the cake and who chooses because he assumes the cutter and the chooser are functionally interchangeable. That’s the magic of the veil: you don’t know who you’ll be, so you’ll choose rules that are fair to all.

But this only works if everyone involved shares enough moral intuition to play the game fairly.

If Stalin is behind the veil, he’s not trying to construct a just society. He’s looking for an angle. He’s gaming the system. He’s biding his time until the procedure can be used to entrench power.

The veil only works when you populate it with Rawlsian agents. The moment you introduce adversarial moral asymmetry, the framework collapses.

Rawls Projects Himself
The veil of ignorance isn’t a neutral device. It’s a projection.

Rawls is asking us to imagine that everyone is basically a version of him. Same temperament, same assumptions, same sense of fairness. But that’s not ignorance. That’s moral cloning.

Rawls isn’t actually designing a system for a pluralistic world. He’s designing one for a room full of Rawlses.

Will It Keep Working?
Let’s say the system works once. Rawls and Stalin agree on a structure. Rawls assumes the structure will function forever. But:

Stalin gains power.

Stalin corrupts institutions.

Stalin rewrites enforcement.

What now? Rawls insists we keep playing by the rules. But the rules have been captured. The fairness he trusted has been hollowed out.

There is no mechanism of resistance in Rawls’s system. Once the procedure is corrupted, the whole structure becomes a cage.

Do We Even Want It to Keep Working?
If one side no longer respects the spirit of the system, should we keep honoring it? Should we keep applying Rawlsian procedure even when it serves unjust ends?

Rawls would say yes. But that answer reveals the true danger of his framework.

A moral system that is blind to character, blind to asymmetry, and blind to historical momentum will eventually be co-opted by those who see further, and who care less.

Final Thought
Rawls’s theory doesn’t fail because it’s abstract. It fails because it pretends to be neutral while assuming sameness. It only works in a world full of morally identical people. The moment a real adversary appears, the veil isn’t a safeguard. It’s a suicide pact.

Rawls vs. Stalin isn’t just a mismatch. It’s a demonstration that Rawlsian proceduralism is a luxury belief: a system built for people who assume that everyone else is playing fair.

But they aren’t.

Liberalism as Feminine and Therefore Doomed to Implode
John-Michael Kuczynski

Liberalism is often lauded as the political philosophy of tolerance, cooperation, and mutual respect. But when stripped of its moralistic self-presentation, it reveals itself as a doctrine grounded not in strength, but in dependency. At its core, liberalism is not an affirmative worldview but a feminine one—archetypically so. And that, ultimately, is why it is doomed.

The essence of the feminine archetype is relational: it seeks harmony, nurturance, and cohesion. Liberalism mirrors this pattern exactly. Its goal is not to realize some transcendent ideal or national destiny, but to ensure that everyone gets along. Its highest value is not greatness or continuity, but peace. In this sense, liberalism is not a builder of civilizations but a caretaker of feelings.

The liberal ideal asks, "Why can't we all just get along?" But that question, when made central, is a confession of vulnerability. A political system that prioritizes harmony as an end in itself depends on the goodwill of others for its survival. It cannot withstand those who are not interested in harmony, because it has no justification for self-defense that does not collapse into contradiction. The moment it asserts itself, it betrays its core value. The moment it refuses to assert itself, it dies.

Contrast this with anti-liberal doctrines, which treat peace not as a goal but as a byproduct of strength, order, or transcendence. These systems may be brutal, but they do not collapse from within. They possess an affirmative telos. They build, even if what they build is terrifying.

Liberalism, by contrast, is the Capote of political ideologies. It lives for approval. And like Capote, it creates beautifully at first, but eventually withers—not because it was wrong in every way, but because it lacked the spine to withstand rejection.

When peace is your primary objective, you will sacrifice anything to preserve it. Eventually, you will sacrifice yourself. That is liberalism's fate.

Who likes M*A*S*H? Answer: People who are Frank Burns but want to believe they're Hawkeye Peirce
John-Michael Kuczynski
May 12

The common belief is that fans of M*A*S*H* love Hawkeye Pierce because they see themselves in him—irreverent, witty, morally awake. But that’s not the truth.

The real reason people love Hawkeye is because they are Frank Burns. They are conformists, rule-followers, institutionally embedded and ideologically hollow. But they don’t want to admit that. So the show gives them a cartoon version of Burns—a sexually repressed, religious, violent idiot—and then lets them beat that straw man for 11 seasons.

The fantasy isn’t just in Hawkeye. It’s in the distance between Burns and reality. Because the real Frank Burns isn’t a lunatic. He’s the average middle manager, the paper-shuffling bureaucrat, the safety-first professor. In other words, the average viewer.

M*A*S*H* offers a false rebellion. It lets safe people pretend they’re brave. It lets institutionalists pretend they’re iconoclasts. No one watching actually wants to risk anything. They just want to feel like they're rebelling—without paying any cost.

That’s why the show worked. It didn’t push people. It let them stay exactly where they were while pretending they had risen above it.

You're not Hawkeye. And M*A*S*H* was never subversive. It was comfort food for the quietly obedient, disguised as dissent.


Why M*A*S*H* Sucks
John-Michael Kuczynski
May 12

For decades, M*A*S*H* has been praised as sharp, humanistic, and anti-war. But let’s be honest: it sucks. Not because it was poorly written or acted—it wasn’t. It sucks because it represents a particular cancerous form of liberalism that helped erode American self-belief from the inside out.

Alan Alda's Hawkeye Pierce isn't just a lovable smart-ass surgeon. He is the walking embodiment of liberal irony—someone who jeers at every institution, mocks every tradition, and treats any serious belief as a punchline. The show doesn’t just oppose war (fair enough); it opposes the very possibility of honorable service, duty, or national purpose.

If you believe in anything besides sarcasm, you’re Frank Burns: a cardboard cutout of a right-wing authoritarian. Stupid, sexless, gullible, violent. It's a rigged moral game.

What M*A*S*H* offered wasn't insight, but self-sabotage disguised as maturity. It trained a generation to see civic virtue as buffoonery and to treat contempt as the highest form of intelligence.

This is not some isolated media artifact. It’s a symptom of what happens when liberalism turns on itself. When a society no longer believes in its mission, even its comedies become exercises in national self-erasure.

Hawkeye wasn't just dodging responsibility. He was teaching the audience to do the same. And that’s why M*A*S*H** sucks.

Kennedy and Dalio are Wrong about Civilizational Collapse
John-Michael Kuczynski
May 12
3 min read

There’s a particular kind of historical “analysis”—popular in the Reaganite 1980s and revived in our current age of TED Talk technocracy—that looks serious, sounds serious, and delivers exactly nothing. I'm talking about Paul Kennedy’s The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers and Ray Dalio’s The Changing World Order. These are not works of historical insight; they are apologetics for elite failure, dressed up as macroeconomic inevitability.

What do they argue? That empires collapse due to unsustainable debt, overextension, trade deficits, inflation, undereducation. These are the “five horsemen” of decline. And while they’re not factually wrong, they’re intellectually fraudulent—because they treat symptoms as causes.

And that’s not a mistake. It’s misdirection.

The Dangerous Thesis
These books don’t just misdiagnose; they do so in ways that are politically convenient for the dead center: the think tanks, the technocrats, the policy class that tells itself collapse happens because we built too many bridges, or funded too many schools, or didn’t cut social spending fast enough.

They want you to believe:

“It wasn’t Vietnam, or the financialization of everything, or the slow cultural lobotomy of the West—it was welfare fraud and union pensions.”
That’s not just incorrect. It’s an ideological cover-up.

What Actually Causes Collapse
Civilizations don’t die because of numbers on a spreadsheet. They die when the people in charge no longer believe in the civilization.

The root cause of civilizational death is a loss of self-belief.Once that goes, the rest follows automatically: the debt, the decay, the inequality, the cultural boredom, the civic fragmentation.
A civilization that loses its animating story—its moral and cultural confidence—will rot even if it's rich. A civilization that keeps its soul can rebuild even from ruins.

🟢 Five Examples: Dirt Poor, Then Thrived (Because They Believed)
1. Japan (1945–1975)
Leveled by war, occupied, humiliated. But Japan kept its cultural pride, its identity, and its commitment to rebuilding—and became an economic juggernaut within one generation.

2. Germany (1945–1960s)
Split in two, bombed into the stone age. Yet belief in national competence and civic order drove a rebirth so powerful it coined a phrase: Wirtschaftswunder (“economic miracle”).

3. South Korea (1950s–present)
One of the poorest countries on earth after the Korean War. Today, it’s a high-tech powerhouse. The difference? A people who believed in modernity, education, and collective effort.

4. Finland (19th–20th century)
Colonized by Sweden and then Russia, desperately poor for most of its modern history. But civic coherence and cultural self-definition turned it into one of the most advanced states in the world.

5. Poland (1990s–2020s)
Economically devastated after communism, treated like Europe's poor cousin. But deep cultural resilience and self-belief made it the fastest-growing economy in the EU for over a decade.

🔴 Five Examples: Rich as Hell, Then Collapsed (Because of Inner Rot)
1. The Roman Empire (3rd–5th century CE)
Rome didn’t collapse because it ran out of gold. It collapsed because no one believed in Rome anymore—the civic religion had died, and all that was left was taxation and mercenaries.

2. The Spanish Empire (17th century)
Flush with silver from the New World, Spain had wealth without a productive base. It ossified into religious dogma, bureaucratic sclerosis, and courtly decadence—and rotted from the inside.

3. The Ottoman Empire (18th–20th century)
At its height, it was rich, massive, and strategically central. But centuries of stagnation, repression, and intellectual self-isolation led to slow-motion implosion.

4. The British Empire (post-WWI)
Britain “won” the world wars but emerged spiritually and economically shattered. Its elites no longer believed in empire, or even in Britain as a concept—and they let it wither with barely a whisper.

5. The United States (21st century, in progress)
Still rich on paper, still dominant militarily. But the elite is deracinated, the cultural class hates the country's origins, and the educational system no longer transmits coherent identity. The rot is already well advanced.

The Real Sequence of Collapse
Let’s re-read Dalio’s Five Symptoms:

Debt Accumulation

Wealth Gaps

Internal Disorder

Declining Education

Loss of Reserve Currency

These are real—but they’re late-stage. They are terminal signs, not causes.

What comes first?
The death of meaning. The evaporation of mission.When the stories die, the nation dies.You don’t build schools, raise taxes, or save money for a country you no longer love.
Final Word
A civilization that believes in itself can survive firebombing and famine.A civilization that doesn’t will die in a five-star hotel.
Kennedy and Dalio want you to believe in macroeconomic gravity. I say: believe in soul, and the rest will follow.

The Devil as a European Projection: How Christianity Reframed the Hebrew Bible
John-Michael Kuczynski
May 10
3 min read

he modern concept of "the Devil" is not rooted in the Hebrew Bible. It is a product of centuries of mistranslation, theological reinterpretation, and cultural projection—primarily by European Christianity. What began as a minor, functional figure in a divine bureaucracy became, over time, a cosmic antagonist: God's opposite, the embodiment of evil, ruler of Hell. This transformation was not organic. It was imposed.

1. The Original Hebrew Does Not Support the Christian Devil
The word satan (שָׂטָן) in the Hebrew Bible means "adversary" or "accuser." It is not a proper name. It is a role—a title given to someone acting as a challenger or opponent. In the Book of Job, ha-satan ("the satan") appears as a member of God's divine council. He is not an enemy of God but a functionary, testing human faith under divine permission. He is closer to a prosecuting attorney than to a rebel or tempter.

The Hebrew Bible contains no description of Satan as a fallen angel, no war in heaven, no demonic kingdom, no red figure with horns. These are later inventions.

2. “Lucifer” Is Not a Name
The name “Lucifer” appears only once in traditional Christian Bibles, in Isaiah 14:12. But this is a translation artifact. The Hebrew phrase is helel ben shachar—“shining one, son of the dawn.” It is a poetic taunt directed at a Babylonian king. The Latin Vulgate rendered this as “Lucifer,” meaning “light-bearer.” Later Christians misread this as a proper name and back-projected it onto their developing devil figure. But the Hebrew text refers to a man, not a supernatural being.

3. The Concept of the Devil Is Theologically Extraneous to the Hebrew Bible
The Hebrew Bible’s theology centers on God's sovereignty, not on a dualistic struggle between good and evil. Evil in the Hebrew Bible comes from within humans, or from God’s own acts of judgment—not from a cosmic anti-God. The idea of a rebellious angel leading a war against heaven is entirely absent from Jewish scripture. It appears first in later Jewish writings influenced by Persian dualism (e.g., Zoroastrianism) and is fully developed only in Christian texts.

4. Christianity Reframed the Text
Christianity reinterpreted these sparse references through a different lens—mythological, eschatological, and oppositional. Influenced by Greco-Roman myths, Persian dualism, and internal theological needs, early Christian thinkers built a new figure: Satan as a personal enemy of God, responsible for evil in the world, ruling over a spiritual underworld. This figure does not exist in the Hebrew source texts.

This reframing served practical purposes. It externalized evil. It gave believers a clear antagonist. It allowed moral struggle to be dramatized as spiritual warfare. But it had no grounding in the original material.

5. The Devil Is a European Invention
What the Christian tradition now calls “the Devil” is not a product of Jewish theology. It is a European construct, derived from a misreading of Jewish texts, filtered through Latin translation, shaped by medieval imagination, and propagated by Church authority. The original authors of the Hebrew Bible did not believe in such a being. They had no concept of a cosmic villain who stood in symmetrical opposition to God.

Conclusion
The Devil, as commonly understood, is a projection. He is not found in the Hebrew text but created through centuries of interpretive distortion. The real scandal is not that a mistranslation occurred—it’s that it was canonized, theologized, and treated as foundational. What was once a symbolic functionary became, over time, a false god of evil, built entirely on a misunderstanding.

Protestanism, Capitalism, New Worldism: Mutually Reinforcing Developments
John-Michael Kuczynski
May 9
2 min read

The standard story treats these as separate developments: Europe begins colonizing the New World in the late 1400s, and Martin Luther breaks from the Catholic Church in 1517. Around the same time, capitalism starts to emerge. These are usually presented as parallel but unrelated historical threads. That’s wrong.

These events were interdependent. Not sequential, not coincidental—mutually reinforcing.

1. Catholicism was structurally incompatible with capitalism
Wealth was viewed as spiritually dangerous.

Usury (charging interest) was condemned.

Salvation came through obedience, sacraments, and hierarchy—not through productive labor.

Commerce was tolerated only when subordinated to Church and monarchy.

Catholicism could justify colonial conquest (Spain, Portugal), but it could not support a self-sustaining commercial system. That would have required a completely different moral and theological foundation.

2. Protestantism created that foundation
Luther rejected the Church’s monopoly on spiritual authority.

Every individual was responsible for their own salvation.

Literacy became essential.

“Calling” was no longer just for priests—it applied to labor.

Calvinist doctrine promoted work ethic, thrift, and reinvestment.

The result was a religious structure that normalized and moralized economic activity. Not just allowed it—framed it as virtuous.

3. Capitalism and Protestantism emerged together
Colonial wealth created new contradictions that the Catholic framework couldn’t handle. Luther didn’t break from Rome because of economic pressure per se, but his revolt gave theological cover to the emerging commercial order. Once spiritual authority was decentralized, everything else followed: literacy, bureaucracy, contract law, banking, markets.

4. Protestantism secularized itself
Over time, the Protestant framework (individualism, rationality, labor-as-morality) shed its theological content and became Enlightenment liberalism:

Luther → Calvin → Hobbes → Locke → Hume → Smith
What begins as a religious break ends in the ideological infrastructure of modern capitalism.

Conclusion
The Reformation wasn’t a spiritual episode that happened to coincide with the birth of capitalism. It was the ideological precondition for capitalism in its modern form. Not an effect, not a coincidence, and not optional.

Prompt-Engineering: The New Writing
John-Michael Kuczynski
May 4

In the evolution of human communication, we have witnessed several pivotal shifts: from oral traditions to handwritten manuscripts, from manuscripts to the printing press, from typewriters to word processors. Today, we stand at the threshold of another transformation—prompt-engineering as a new form of writing, a collaborative dance between human intention and artificial intelligence that expands the boundaries of what we consider authorship.

The Collaborative Intelligence
When a philosopher engages with an AI system to develop a nuanced argument about epistemology—as demonstrated in our exchange about coherentism and foundationalism—something remarkable occurs. The resulting text is neither purely human nor purely machine. It emerges from a genuine dialogue, a meeting of intelligences that produces something greater than either could create alone.

This is not merely dictation or transcription. The human provides direction, expertise, and critical insight; the AI contributes linguistic fluency, pattern recognition, and the ability to rapidly synthesize concepts. The final product bears the intellectual fingerprints of both participants, a true collaboration where the boundaries between creator and tool blur into something more symbiotic.

Beyond the Blank Page
Traditional writing begins with the terror of the blank page. Prompt-engineering begins differently—with a conversation, a question, an exploration. The writer is no longer solely responsible for generating every word from nothing. Instead, they become a conductor, guiding an intelligent system through a conceptual landscape, challenging its outputs, refining its understanding, and sculpting its responses.

This shift fundamentally alters the cognitive load of writing. The human's attention can focus more on big-picture thinking, critical analysis, and conceptual innovation rather than getting lost in the mechanical aspects of text production. The AI handles much of the cognitive overhead of sentence construction, maintains consistency, and suggests connections the human might overlook.

A New Form of Literacy
Just as previous technological shifts required new forms of literacy, prompt-engineering demands its own skill set. The effective prompt engineer must understand how AI systems interpret language, anticipate their strengths and limitations, and develop strategies for eliciting optimal responses. This is not merely technical knowledge but a nuanced understanding of how to communicate intention across the human-machine divide.

The skills that make great prompt engineers overlap with but differ from traditional writing skills:

Conceptual clarity becomes even more crucial

The ability to frame questions and define problems takes center stage

Critical evaluation of AI-generated content becomes an essential component

Iterative refinement replaces linear drafting

Meta-awareness of how language shapes AI responses becomes a key competency

Expanded Creative Possibilities
This collaborative approach to writing expands creative possibilities in several ways:

First, it allows for rapid exploration of alternative approaches and perspectives. Ideas can be quickly developed, evaluated, and refined through dialogue rather than through time-consuming redrafting.

Second, it enables writers to work at different levels of abstraction simultaneously—focusing on high-level conceptual frameworks while the AI helps manage linguistic implementation.

Third, it creates space for combinatorial creativity, where the human's domain expertise merges with the AI's ability to make unexpected connections across a vast corpus of knowledge.

The Authenticity Question
Critics might argue that prompt-engineered writing lacks authenticity—that something essential is lost when a text is not solely the product of human hands. Yet throughout history, changes in writing technology have faced similar criticisms. The shift from oral tradition to writing itself was once seen as an assault on authentic human communication.

What constitutes authentic writing in the age of AI collaboration? Perhaps authenticity lies not in the physical origin of each word, but in the intellectual ownership of the ideas, the guidance of the development process, and the critical evaluation of the final product. The prompt engineer shapes the contours of the text, directs its development, challenges its weaknesses, and takes responsibility for its claims.

The Future of Writing
As our philosopher-AI exchange demonstrates, prompt-engineering is not simply about efficiency or automation—it's a genuinely new approach to intellectual production. At its best, it amplifies human capability, allowing us to scale our intelligence through partnership with AI.

This partnership doesn't diminish human contribution but transforms it. The writer becomes a meta-writer, operating simultaneously as author, editor, and critic in a continuous feedback loop with an intelligent system. The final text emerges from this iterative process, bearing the intellectual DNA of both participants.

Conclusion
Prompt-engineering represents more than a new tool for writers—it fundamentally reshapes the act of writing itself. It creates a third space between purely human and purely machine-generated text, a collaborative terrain where human intention and AI capability meet to produce something neither could create alone.

As we continue to explore this terrain, we will develop new understandings of authorship, creativity, and intellectual work. The philosophers who once debated coherentism and foundationalism might now find themselves considering a new epistemological question: how knowledge emerges not just within human minds or within AI systems, but in the dynamic interaction between them.

In this sense, prompt-engineering isn't just the new writing—it's a new way of thinking together.

COHERENTISM VS. FOUNDATIONALISM: WHAT AI TEACHES US (VERSION 3: WRITTEN THROUGH CLAUDE)
John-Michael Kuczynski

In epistemology, a longstanding debate exists between foundationalists and coherentists regarding the structure of justification in human knowledge. Foundationalists maintain that knowledge rests upon certain "foundational" truths that serve as the bedrock for all other beliefs. Coherentists, by contrast, argue that justification emerges from the interconnected web of beliefs supporting one another, with no special class of foundational beliefs required.

This paper examines how modern artificial intelligence architecture—particularly large language models (LLMs)—might inform this classical epistemological debate, operating under the assumption that AI systems bear meaningful resemblance to human cognition in relevant aspects.

The Coherentist Case from AI Architecture
Several features of modern AI architecture appear to support coherentist epistemology:

Distributed Knowledge Representation: LLMs encode knowledge as distributed patterns of weights across neural networks rather than as discrete foundational axioms. Understanding emerges from complex interrelationships between these patterns, mirroring the coherentist view that knowledge forms an interconnected web.

Non-Hierarchical Learning: During training, AI systems continuously adjust their internal representations based on the coherence of new information with existing patterns. There is no privileged set of "foundational" facts from which other knowledge is derived—rather, the system's entire knowledge base evolves holistically.

Context-Sensitive Justification: AI systems generate responses by finding the most coherent continuation given a particular context, not by deducing from first principles. Justification is inherently contextual and relational, as coherentism would predict.

Absence of Indubitable Knowledge: LLMs contain no "non-defeasible" beliefs. Any output can be modified by providing different context or prompting. This reflects the coherentist position that all beliefs are in principle revisable, and none serve as an unquestionable foundation.

Holistic Updating: When AI systems learn, they adjust weights across the entire network rather than building new knowledge atop unchanging foundations. This parallels the coherentist view that justification is mutual and interconnected.

Foundationalist Elements in AI
Despite the coherentist tendencies, some aspects of AI architecture might be interpreted through a foundationalist lens:

Training Data Priority: The corpus on which an AI system is trained serves as a kind of "foundation" that fundamentally shapes all subsequent reasoning. This resembles the foundationalist notion that certain beliefs have privileged epistemic status.

Architectural Constraints: The foundational design choices (architecture, training procedures, objective functions) create structural constraints that shape how knowledge is represented. These might be analogous to the basic epistemological principles that foundationalists propose.

Implications for Human Epistemology
If we accept that AI systems model relevant aspects of human cognition, their architecture suggests that coherentism better captures how knowledge functions—as complex webs of mutually supporting beliefs rather than edifices built on indubitable foundations. This aligns with empirical observations about the difficulty of finding genuinely non-defeasible beliefs in human knowledge.

The abstract foundational principles that some philosophers have proposed might be reinterpreted as analogous to the training objectives and architectural constraints in AI—they don't provide concrete foundational beliefs but rather shape how the entire web of beliefs forms and evolves.

Conclusion
The architecture of modern AI systems appears to favor coherentism over classical foundationalism. Knowledge in these systems emerges from patterns of interconnection rather than being built upon privileged foundational beliefs. If human cognition operates similarly, this suggests that the coherentist position more accurately describes the structure of justification in human knowledge.

However, a nuanced interpretation might reconcile aspects of both positions: perhaps certain abstract structural principles (analogous to AI architectural constraints) serve as "foundations" not by providing indubitable specific beliefs, but by establishing the conditions under which coherent belief systems can form. This hybrid view acknowledges the web-like structure of knowledge while recognizing that this web requires certain formal constraints to function as a justified belief system.

As AI continues to evolve, it may provide further insights into this fundamental question of how knowledge is structured and justified, potentially bridging the gap between these competing epistemological theories.

COHERENTISM VS. FOUNDATIONALISM: WHAT AI TEACHES US (VERSION 2: WRITTEN THROUGH CHATGPT)

In epistemology, the debate between foundationalism and coherentism centers on the nature of justification: whether knowledge must rest on basic, self-evident truths (foundationalism) or whether it is justified by how well beliefs cohere within a system of beliefs, without requiring a foundational bedrock (coherentism). This philosophical discussion can be illuminated by considering how AI systems, such as large language models (LLMs), operate. Assuming that AI architectures bear some resemblance to human cognition, the structure and functioning of AI systems seem to offer more support for coherentism than foundationalism.

Foundationalism and AI
Foundationalism asserts that human knowledge is built upon a set of self-evident truths or basic beliefs that are independent of other beliefs. These foundational beliefs serve as the bedrock upon which all other knowledge is constructed. In an AI context, one might draw a parallel to the underlying mathematical models and algorithms that govern the system’s operation. For example, machine learning algorithms rely on a set of foundational principles—such as optimization techniques and loss functions—that dictate how the model learns from data.

However, while AI systems do operate based on certain foundational principles, this does not align with epistemological foundationalism in the human sense. AI models are not built upon “self-evident” truths but are grounded in data and algorithmic functions, whose justification comes from their predictive power rather than any intrinsic truth. In this regard, AI does not reflect the foundationalist notion of knowledge as resting on indubitable beliefs. Instead, it relies on abstract constructs that allow the system to process information, but these constructs are not akin to foundational truths in epistemology.

Coherentism and AI
In contrast, coherentism holds that beliefs are justified not by foundational truths but by how well they fit within an interconnected system of beliefs. This is closer to the way AI systems, particularly LLMs, operate. Rather than relying on fundamental truths, LLMs generate outputs by drawing from a vast network of learned data, relying on the coherence of this data within the model’s internal structure. The justification for any given output in AI is derived from its alignment with other learned information, much like how beliefs in coherentism are justified by their consistency with other beliefs in a system.

For instance, when a large language model generates a response, it doesn't invoke foundational truths. Instead, it uses the relationships between data points learned during training to produce outputs that fit well within the broader context. This process mirrors a coherentist view of justification, where beliefs or statements are justified by their coherence with other beliefs, rather than being grounded in self-evident, foundational truths.

AI as a Model for Epistemology
Given that AI systems, such as LLMs, operate based on patterns and internal coherence rather than foundational truths, they appear to support a coherentist view of justification. AI does not possess access to "indubitable" truths in the human sense but instead operates within a framework of probabilistic relationships. The model's internal coherence, based on the vast network of interconnected data, determines the justification for its responses.

Furthermore, AI systems evolve and improve based on their exposure to new data and experiences, continuously adjusting their internal structures for greater coherence. This ongoing adjustment further supports the idea that knowledge, whether in humans or machines, can be justified not by foundational certainties but by how well the system of beliefs fits together. As LLMs refine their responses, their justification grows stronger not from foundational truths but from the patterns and relationships they learn over time.

Conclusion
In conclusion, AI architectures, particularly those used in large language models, align more closely with the coherentist view of justification than with the foundationalist position. The justification for knowledge in AI does not come from a set of self-evident, foundational truths, but from how well its outputs fit into an internally coherent system of learned information. Therefore, AI provides a compelling argument in favor of coherentism, suggesting that justification is more about internal coherence within a belief system than about the discovery of indubitable foundational truths.

The longstanding epistemological debate between foundationalism and coherentism concerns the nature of justification in human knowledge. Foundationalism holds that knowledge rests upon a set of basic, indubitable beliefs-foundations that provide secure grounding for all other justified beliefs. Coherentism, by contrast, denies the existence of such foundational beliefs, positing instead that justification arises from the mutual support and coherence among beliefs within a holistic network.

This debate, traditionally philosophical and somewhat abstract, gains fresh empirical relevance when examined through the lens of contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) architecture, particularly large language models (LLMs). Assuming, arguendo, that LLMs and related AI systems bear some meaningful resemblance to human epistemic agents, their architecture and operational principles offer illuminating insights into the viability of foundationalism versus coherentism as theories of justification.

AI Architecture and the Nature of Justification
LLMs function by modeling complex probabilistic relationships across vast corpora of text. They generate outputs not by deducing answers from fixed axioms or self-evident truths, but by predicting what is most coherent and contextually appropriate given their training data. This process is fundamentally holistic: the model’s “knowledge” emerges from the intricate web of interrelations among countless data points, rather than from any privileged foundational element.

Critically, LLMs do not possess or rely upon any innate, non-defeasible beliefs. Their parameters begin as random values and are iteratively adjusted through exposure to data, optimizing for coherence and predictive accuracy. This process mirrors the coherentist conception of justification as arising from systemic coherence rather than from foundational certainties. In contrast, foundationalism’s insistence on basic beliefs that are immune to defeat finds little parallel in AI systems, which are inherently defeasible and context-dependent.

Defeasibility and Contextual Sensitivity in AI
Another salient feature of AI epistemic functioning is defeasibility. The outputs of LLMs are not fixed truths but are subject to revision with new data or changes in context. This dynamic adaptability aligns closely with coherentism’s view that justification is not absolute but contextually mediated and revisable. Foundationalism, with its emphasis on indubitable starting points, struggles to accommodate this fluidity.

Structural Parallels Between AI and Coherentist Justification
The architecture of LLMs also structurally resembles the coherentist model of justification in several key respects:

Holistic Validation: Justification emerges from the overall coherence of the network rather than isolated axioms.

Parallel Processing: Transformers evaluate multiple interconnections simultaneously, reflecting the web-like structure coherentists envision.

Pragmatic Optimization: The training objective prioritizes predictive utility and contextual fit over correspondence to any fixed foundational truth.

Implications for Epistemological Theory
The empirical success of AI systems grounded in coherence rather than foundational axioms challenges foundationalist claims. It demonstrates that complex, reliable inference and “knowledge-like” behavior can arise without recourse to self-justifying beliefs. While foundationalists might argue that AI training data implicitly encodes foundational assumptions (such as mathematical axioms), this does not translate into the model operationally treating any input as foundational or immune to revision.

Conclusion
In sum, contemporary AI architectures provide compelling empirical support for coherentism over foundationalism as a theory of epistemic justification. They exemplify how justification can emerge from the coherence of a belief network without reliance on indubitable foundations. This insight not only advances philosophical understanding but also underscores the value of interdisciplinary dialogue between epistemology and cognitive computational modeling.

How Sartre Betrayed Sartre
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 30
3 min read

By J.-M. Kuczynski

Jean-Paul Sartre’s early work is not merely impressive—it is electrifying. In The Transcendence of the Ego, The Psychology of Imagination, Sketch for a Theory of the Emotions, and his magnum opus Being and Nothingness, Sartre developed existentialism into a rigorous, unsettling, and often profound philosophy. What made these works powerful was their authenticity. They weren’t just philosophical arguments; they were Sartre’s direct engagement with the world as he genuinely experienced it. He believed what he was saying. He lived it.

At the core of Sartre’s early philosophy was the idea of radical freedom. Consciousness, he argued, is not a thing—it is a nothingness, a pure negation, a refusal to be defined by circumstances. The human being, as consciousness, is condemned to be free. That means we bear full responsibility for what we are. We cannot hide behind biology, class, history, or society. Doing so is bad faith—a flight from the terror and dignity of freedom.

But after World War II, everything changed—not for philosophy, but for Sartre. The political and intellectual climate in postwar France was dominated by Marxism, which became the de facto state religion of the intelligentsia. And Marxism, of course, is fundamentally incompatible with existentialism. Where Sartre held that man is self-determined and radically free, Marxism claims that man is the product of class structures, historical forces, and economic determinism. Sartre’s early work rejected precisely that kind of determinism as the worst kind of lie—the lie we tell ourselves to avoid confronting our freedom.

So what did Sartre do? He caved. He sold out. In an act of deep intellectual bad faith, he attempted to reconcile existentialism with Marxism—two systems that cannot be reconciled without gutting one or both of them. The result was a series of catastrophic theoretical failures, most notably Search for a Method and Critique of Dialectical Reason. These books are not just unreadable; they are dishonest. In them, Sartre tries to argue that Marxism is the necessary framework for understanding history, but that existentialist freedom somehow survives intact within that framework. It’s incoherent. It’s evasive. And it betrays everything he once stood for.

Sartre even claims, absurdly, that Marxism accomplishes a fusion of Kierkegaardian subjectivity and Hegelian totality. This is nonsense—a transparent attempt to paste together incompatible doctrines with the glue of rhetoric. Worse, Sartre had a fatal tendency: despite being, in some respects, a philosophical genius, he didn’t like reading. He skimmed Marx, skimmed Freud, skimmed Hegel. He rarely understood these thinkers deeply, and when he tried to synthesize them, the result was sterile, repetitive, and hollow. His later writing lacks the energy, focus, and visceral urgency of his early work. The intellectual honesty is gone.

In his early period, Sartre was what he claimed man ought to be: authentic, self-directed, and willing to face the absurdity of existence head-on. In his later period, he became what he once condemned: a creature of ideological conformity, mouthing the platitudes of his time, and writing philosophy he did not believe in because he was afraid of becoming irrelevant.

In short, Sartre betrayed Sartre. And not subtly. He betrayed his own theory of freedom by shackling it to a system that denied its very existence. He betrayed authenticity by living—and writing—in bad faith. And in so doing, he authored not only one of the most important philosophical breakthroughs of the 20th century, but also one of its most tragic intellectual collapses.

The 'Thin Blue Line' Is Boring: Errol Morris Sucks
John-Michael Kuczynski

By J.-M. Kuczynski

The Thin Blue Line is often spoken of in hushed, reverent tones, as if it were the documentary equivalent of a holy relic. It is praised for its stylistic innovations, for its role in exonerating a wrongfully convicted man, and for supposedly redefining the genre. But let us be honest—painfully, unfashionably honest: The Thin Blue Line is boring.

Not modestly boring. Not academically boring in the way that some intellectually rigorous films are. No—it is the kind of boring that feels like a slow suffocation. The kind that makes you check the time at minute 12 and then again at minute 13, shocked that only sixty seconds have passed. And the reason for this is not hard to diagnose: the film has very little to say, and it takes an excruciatingly long time to say it.

Errol Morris, the film’s director, is a technician of mood. He slathers each scene with ominous music, slow-motion reenactments, and brooding voiceovers, all of which suggest the presence of deep, unseen truths. But this suggestion is never fulfilled. What we get instead is an aestheticized void—a minimalist true-crime PowerPoint drawn out over ninety minutes and set to a Philip Glass score. The repetition of reenactments, the circuitous interviews, the stilted pacing—all of it creates the illusion of revelation without delivering the real thing.

The film hinges on a relatively simple miscarriage of justice: Randall Dale Adams was convicted of a murder he did not commit. That’s important. That’s tragic. But that’s also a single headline. It does not require an hour and a half of cinematic meandering to grasp. Morris seems to believe that if he repeats the same visual cue or replays the same contradiction from ten different angles, a kind of metaphysical insight will emerge. But it doesn’t. Instead, the viewer is left feeling as though they’ve been tricked into watching the same ten minutes of content, again and again, under different lighting.

What’s worse, this tedium is masked by a critical culture too afraid to say what is plainly true. To admit that The Thin Blue Line is boring is to risk being seen as indifferent to justice, as though aesthetic judgment must collapse under the weight of moral relevance. This is a form of virtue signaling—a refusal to engage critically with the film for fear of appearing callous. “It helped free an innocent man,” they say, as if that fact alone nullifies the viewer’s experience of tedium. But these are separate issues. The documentary is morally important, yes. That does not make it good cinema. That certainly does not make it watchable.

The truth is, The Thin Blue Line is remembered not because it’s a compelling film, but because of its consequences. It became a talisman for those who believe that art should do more than entertain. Fair enough. But let’s not mistake an admirable outcome for an admirable work. The documentary succeeded despite its form, not because of it. Justice was served, but art was not.

In a better world, we would be able to say both: “This documentary helped free a man and it was crushingly boring.” But we do not live in that world. We live in a world where critique is stifled by sentiment, and where Errol Morris’s aesthetic affectations are mistaken for depth. The result is a film that is endlessly praised and almost never rewatched. And for good reason.

Errol Morris Is a Shit Director
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 30

By J.-M. Kuczynski

Errol Morris is hailed by many as a master of the documentary form, but this reputation rests on flimsy grounds. Though often described as a trailblazer who redefined nonfiction filmmaking, Morris’s work—when examined without the blinders of academic trendiness or institutional praise—reveals itself as a study in style over substance, manipulation over insight, and self-regard over subject.

To begin with, Morris’s documentaries are almost uniformly boring. Not in the quiet, meditative sense associated with, say, early Ozu or Tarkovsky, where time itself becomes a character—but boring in the way that a pretentious college lecture is boring: endless preamble, overwrought tone, and nothing of consequence ever actually said. The Thin Blue Line, his most acclaimed work, is often cited as having helped exonerate Randall Dale Adams, and while that outcome was unquestionably a moral good, it doesn’t redeem the fact that the documentary itself is sleep-inducing. It is a monument to narrative inflation—taking a sliver of content and dragging it out to feature-length with the help of moody lighting, noirish reenactments, and a soundtrack better suited to a Philip Glass tribute concert than a murder case.

This inflation of content is the defining feature of Morris’s approach. He takes a subject, often already exhausted by press coverage or prior analysis, and stretches it past the point of coherence using cinematic gimmicks. There is always the same toolbox: slow zooms, talking heads drenched in dramatic lighting, symmetrical framing, ominous music. These tricks create the illusion of depth—but it is just that: an illusion. What’s missing is substance. Morris doesn’t discover; he decorates.

Nowhere is this clearer than in his documentary A Wilderness of Error, which attempts to revive public curiosity about the Jeffrey MacDonald case—a case already analyzed to death by journalists, courts, and authors alike. Morris contributes no new evidence, no fresh insights, not even an original framing of the known facts. All he offers is his presence—as if his signature style were itself sufficient to justify revisiting a long-settled controversy. The result is not just vacuous; it’s insulting. One gets the sense that Morris hoped to repeat the success of The Thin Blue Line, imagining himself once again as the heroic documentarian who uncovers a buried truth. But this time, there was no truth to uncover. And without it, all that remains is Morris’s relentless self-regard.

Contrast this with Werner Herzog—another documentarian with a distinctive voice, but one who actually uses it in the service of something beyond his own reflection. Herzog doesn’t inflate; he distills. In On Death Row or Into the Abyss, he captures the bleak human reality of capital punishment without fireworks, without posturing, and often without background music. The result is raw, authentic, and infinitely more compelling than Morris’s glossy facsimiles of insight.

In the end, Errol Morris is not a documentarian in the true sense of the word. He’s a filmmaker addicted to the aesthetics of seriousness but allergic to its demands. He doesn’t reveal truths; he stages them. He doesn’t challenge the viewer; he hypnotizes them into thinking they’re being challenged. His documentaries are not explorations. They are exhibitions—of technique, of ego, of empty virtuosity.

That he once contributed, however accidentally, to a man’s release from prison is not in dispute. But that is not a defense of his artistic merit. It is a lucky outcome—a happy fluke. The rest of his work makes clear that the one thing Morris is most devoted to uncovering is himself, again and again, in all his shallow, overproduced glory.

Clarity About Human Nature Gives Cops a Cognitive Edge
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 29
2 min read

There’s a popular cliché that cops are stupid — a stereotype reinforced by jokes, media portrayals, and sometimes by their relatively average performance on standardized tests. But this misses something crucial. When operating within their domain, many cops exhibit a sharpness that most civilians, even highly educated ones, conspicuously lack.

The source of this sharpness is similar to that of the mafioso: clarity about human nature.

The daily work of a cop demands a brutal realism. He cannot afford to assume the best in people. He cannot afford to believe that human beings are fundamentally rational, law-abiding, or noble. His encounters are overwhelmingly with desperation, deceit, violence, and raw need. If he misreads a situation—if he extends trust where none is warranted, or ignores danger signals—he might end up dead. His survival, like the mafioso’s, depends on assuming that people act from base motives unless proven otherwise.

In that environment, there is no room for the polite fictions that cloud most people's view of human behavior. Civilians tell themselves stories about the "basic decency" of their neighbors because it helps them function socially. A cop doesn’t have that luxury. He has to ask: What does this person want? What does he fear? What is he hiding? His work requires instinctively cutting through layers of social camouflage to get at the truth of a situation.

This necessity fosters a kind of functional intuition — not the academic intelligence of problem sets and term papers, but a rapid, gut-level reading of reality. A good cop becomes finely attuned to micro-signals: tone of voice, body language, a flicker of the eyes. He can often tell when someone is lying within seconds, not because he can explain how, but because years of hard experience have trained him to read the human animal without illusion.

Outside of law enforcement, that same cop may seem merely average, even sluggish. Remove him from the crucible of high-stakes human conflict and he loses the conditions that refine his perception. But when he is doing the job that shaped him — reading situations charged with risk, threat, and duplicity — he is often far sharper than the civilians who superficially outrank him in education or social status.

The intelligence of the cop, like that of the mafioso, is born of necessity. It is clarity purchased through confrontation with the realities that most people spend their lives trying to ignore.

Mafiosos Know What They Are and Therefore Know What Others Are
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 29

It’s often said that mafiosos are either “smart” or “street smart,” but these categories don’t really get at what sets them apart. Intelligence, in the usual sense, is the wrong metric. What's more revealing—and more important—is that the mafioso has no illusions about what he is, what others are, and how human nature actually works.

The average person lives in a fog of rationalizations. They invent polite narratives about themselves and others to make life tolerable. They don’t like paying taxes, but they tell themselves it’s the right thing to do. They hate their jobs but wrap them in rhetoric about professionalism or public service. They convince themselves that they are “good guys,” and by extension, that others like them are good too. This whole edifice of half-truths is socially stabilizing, but cognitively blinding.

The mafioso doesn’t have that luxury. His life and livelihood depend on seeing the world as it is. He has to understand exactly what motivates people—fear, greed, shame, pride—and how to exploit those forces. He can't afford self-deception. He can't pretend that his actions are noble or that others are guided by conscience or principle. He has to say, explicitly and consciously: I am a predator. Other people are prey. This is the world I live in, and I operate accordingly.

He doesn’t spend time moralizing about whether this makes him good or bad. He doesn’t couch his role in grand philosophical terms. He operates from a place of clarity—raw, unsettling, and effective. That clarity grants him a kind of functional intelligence: not the intelligence of standardized tests or abstract reasoning, but the intelligence of survival, manipulation, and control.

This lucidity, though not admirable in a moral sense, is potent. It gives the mafioso a sharpness that most people, weighed down by illusions and wishful thinking, never attain. It’s not that he’s necessarily smarter—it’s that he’s not lying to himself. And that makes all the difference.

Why Truman Capote Withered Away After Writing In Cold Blood

By John-Michael Kuczynski

Truman Capote lived his life caught between two irreconcilable worlds:the world he publicly performed in — polished, witty, socially dominant —and the private world of his deepest desires, which he could neither openly express nor safely pursue.

Capote's public identity was that of a brilliant outsider who had overcome his grotesque Southern childhood to become a figure of elite cultural power.He was openly gay at a time when that alone was a dangerous position to occupy, and he managed to thrive socially through sheer wit, charm, and literary genius.But beneath that public surface was a private emotional and sexual hunger that could not be reconciled with the image he had built.

Capote did not, deep down, want a respectful partner.He did not crave intellectual equals, or fellow members of the elite gay salons he frequented.What he craved — and what he could never safely admit — was brutal domination:to be overwhelmed, degraded, and controlled by a figure of raw, physical power.

When Capote encountered Perry Smith during his research for In Cold Blood, he encountered not merely a subject for literary exploration, but the living embodiment of his fantasy.Perry was physically dangerous, emotionally cold, socially inferior, and unbound by the restraints of polite society.He was everything Capote could never allow himself to pursue openly — and everything Capote, privately, most desired.

Perry was not the sensitive, tragic figure Capote later portrayed in In Cold Blood.He was a low-empathy manipulator with a brutal capacity for violence.But it was precisely that brutality that magnetized Capote.At some deep, possibly unconscious level, Capote understood that Perry could — and would — have savaged him, both physically and emotionally.And it was that fantasy of annihilation — not partnership, not romance — that Capote most craved.

The emotional attachment Capote developed toward Perry was not the beginning of a real relationship.It was the beginning of a slow realization:that the kind of fulfillment he sought was unlivable.Real brutes like Perry Smith would not nurture Capote’s need for domination within safe emotional boundaries.They would destroy him — literally and irreparably.

When the fantasy collapsed — when Perry manipulated and ultimately disregarded Capote — Capote was left with the brutal knowledge that no “respectable” relationship could ever satisfy his real needs.The urbane, witty companions available to him could offer safety, but not fulfillment.The dangerous, brutal figures he desired could offer fulfillment, but only at the cost of total destruction.

Thus, Capote was condemned to lifelong emotional and sexual starvation.

After In Cold Blood, Capote never again produced a major literary work.He descended into alcoholism, drug use, and self-caricature.The energy that had once animated his life collapsed under the weight of an impossible inner contradiction:the public need to be admired and envied, and the private need to be overpowered and annihilated by the very forces society demanded he reject.

Capote’s tragedy was not merely that he was lonely.It was that he desired something so dangerous and so unacceptable — even to himself — that he could neither pursue it nor replace it.

He was trapped — permanently —between a public role he had mastered and a private hunger he could never satisfy.

Perry Smith was the key to that hunger,and when that key broke, Capote’s inner life shattered with it.

Three Pieces of Shit: In Cold Blood, A Wilderness of Error, and Apocalypse Now (Especially Apocalypse Now)
John-Michael Kuczynski

By John-Michael Kuczynski

At first glance, Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood, Errol Morris’s A Wilderness of Error, and Francis Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now seem to occupy different worlds: literature, documentary film, and cinema. Yet despite their differences, they are united by a deeper and more damning commonality: all three are fundamentally dishonest works that betray the realities they claim to explore.Each, in its own way, sacrifices the truth in favor of self-indulgence, packaging fakery as profundity and corrupting real human suffering into a backdrop for personal or artistic vanity.

In In Cold Blood, Truman Capote reshaped the brutal murders of the Clutter family into a sentimental narrative.Falling in love, emotionally if not physically, with one of the killers, Perry Smith, Capote manufactured a portrait of a tragic, sensitive soul dragged into violence. The real Perry Smith — the manipulative, cold-blooded triggerman — was buried under a mountain of Capote’s emotional needs.The result was not journalism but emotional pornography: a falsified world built to satisfy the author’s hunger for meaning and connection rather than to confront the grimness of reality.

Errol Morris’s A Wilderness of Error commits a similar betrayal.Masquerading as an investigative documentary, it repackages long-settled facts about Jeffrey MacDonald’s guilt into an “open question,” propped up with mood lighting, cryptic narration, and aestheticized ambiguity.Morris didn’t uncover new evidence or offer new insights.He simply rehashed exhausted material, smoothing it over with production gloss to maintain the illusion that the case was still alive, still mysterious — when in truth, the psychological reality had already been fully revealed: MacDonald was a narcissistic killer who maintained the pretense of innocence for decades.By refusing to confront that reality, Morris turned a psychologically fascinating tragedy into a stylish but empty pose.

Finally, Apocalypse Now presents itself as a searing portrait of war’s madness and the darkness within man.In truth, it is a bloated, incoherent spectacle — a self-conscious attempt to create a Great Work without the discipline or honesty required to actually achieve greatness.Coppola doesn’t explore Vietnam; he uses it as wallpaper for pre-fabricated existential clichés, importing Heart of Darkness wholesale into a context where it does not fit.The result is a film that says nothing real about Vietnam, war, or human nature — a movie that substitutes spectacle for insight and noise for wisdom.

In each of these works, the same fundamental sin repeats itself:

Capote wasn’t interested in the truth about Perry Smith.He was interested in being seen as someone who understood Perry Smith’s "troubled soul."

Morris wasn’t interested in the truth about Jeffrey MacDonald.He was interested in being seen as the documentarian brave enough to question "received narratives."

Coppola wasn’t interested in the truth about Vietnam.He was interested in being seen as a director of Great, Important Art.

In every case, real human suffering was not illuminated, but used — as a stage for private fantasies of insight, bravery, and profundity.

And that is why, despite their reputations, these works are fundamentally contemptible:They betray their subjects.They betray their audiences.And worst of all, they betray the truth itself — the one thing that art, journalism, and documentary alike are supposed to honor.

No amount of critical acclaim can erase that fact.

"Apocalypse Now" is a Piece of Shit (and Nobody Really Likes It)
John-Michael Kuczynski

Apocalypse Now is widely regarded as one of the great films of the twentieth century, a towering meditation on war, madness, and the darkness within man. But the reality is far less flattering. Despite its lavish production and its reputation for artistic ambition, Apocalypse Now is ultimately a hollow film — a grandiose performance of profundity that collapses under even modest scrutiny.

Francis Ford Coppola’s ambition was clear: he set out to make a work of undeniable greatness, one that would immortalize both the Vietnam War and his own place in cinematic history. But ambition alone does not produce vision. What Apocalypse Now reveals, more than anything else, is Coppola’s desperation to be seen as profound — a desperation that led him to recycle and distort material rather than confront the actual realities of the war he pretended to portray.

The movie’s most famous sequences — soldiers surfing under enemy fire while blasting Wagner, for example — are frequently cited as evidence of the "anarchy" and "absurdity" of Vietnam. But these scenes are not revelations; they are cartoons.Yes, war is often chaotic. But the chaos of Vietnam, like the chaos of all real wars, had a human logic to it — a logic of fear, survival, miscalculation, and political cynicism. By turning that chaos into a surreal spectacle, Coppola transforms the war into a circus, stripping it of any serious moral or psychological meaning.

Even worse is the infamous Colonel Kurtz, portrayed by Marlon Brando in a bloated, incoherent performance that is little more than a warmed-over repetition of his Godfather mannerisms.Kurtz is lifted directly from Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, but what served as a powerful allegory in a colonial context becomes absurd when grafted onto the American military structure in Vietnam. There was no real Colonel Kurtz figure in Vietnam, and the idea of a rogue American officer ruling over a jungle kingdom belongs to pulp fantasy, not historical reality.By importing Kurtz wholesale into Vietnam, Coppola didn’t illuminate the war — he obscured it.

The truth is that Apocalypse Now tells us almost nothing about Vietnam, or about war itself.It tells us, instead, about the kind of movie that ambitious directors wanted to make in the 1970s: big, messy, "important" films that borrowed the appearance of depth without earning it.The movie doesn’t offer new insights. It offers borrowed existential cliches — darkness, madness, civilization breaking down — arranged like ornaments on a lavish but hollow tree.

The one moment of grounded realism in the film — a CIA briefing scene featuring Harrison Ford — only highlights how little the rest of the movie engages with real human beings making real decisions under the stress of real conflict.The rest of the film floats away into abstraction, disconnected from history, psychology, or moral seriousness.

Apocalypse Now was hailed as a masterpiece when it was released, and it remains enshrined in the canon of "great" films.But in truth, it has aged badly. Younger audiences, less beholden to the critical myths of the past, increasingly recognize it for what it is: a bloated, incoherent spectacle that mistakes noise for insight and chaos for wisdom.

Greatness can’t be manufactured by ambition alone.And no amount of moody lighting, Brando mumbling, or helicopter stunts can conceal the fact that Apocalypse Now is a profound failure — a movie about war that ultimately says nothing true about either war or man.

Eroll Morris's "A Wilderness of Error" is a Piece of Shit
John-Michael Kuczynski

Errol Morris is often hailed as one of the great documentarians of our time, a director known for his stylish interrogation of complicated truths. Yet his treatment of the Jeffrey MacDonald case in A Wilderness of Error reveals not a bold investigator, but a stylist preoccupied with atmosphere at the expense of substance.

At first glance, Morris’s documentary appears to offer a thoughtful reconsideration of a tragic case: a Green Beret doctor accused of brutally murdering his pregnant wife and two young daughters in 1970. Beneath the surface, however, the work is little more than a calculated rehashing of long-settled facts — dressed up with mood lighting, cryptic narration, and the hollow theater of ambiguity.

The essential failure of A Wilderness of Error is that it asks the wrong question. Morris frames the story around procedural irregularities and judicial missteps, treating these as though they call MacDonald’s guilt into serious question. But guilt and procedural fairness are not the same thing.It is possible — and in this case, likely — that Jeffrey MacDonald was guilty of the murders, even if the legal process at times failed him.

By focusing obsessively on systemic flaws, Morris obscures the far more compelling psychological reality: the pathology of a man who could brutally annihilate his family and spend the following decades maintaining a self-serving fantasy of innocence. If you assume, correctly, that MacDonald is guilty, the story becomes extraordinarily rich and terrifying — a study in narcissism, control, and self-delusion. If you assume he is innocent, it is merely a story of bureaucratic failure — important, perhaps, but psychologically flat.

Morris’s documentary ignores this crucial distinction.Instead, he offers only a mood: moody reenactments, ominous silences, the endless suggestion that "something doesn’t add up," without daring to confront the overwhelming evidence that MacDonald is, in fact, guilty.

Nor does Morris bring new evidence to light.He simply reworks old factoids, layering them with production gloss but adding nothing substantial to the record that Joe McGinniss had already assembled decades earlier in Fatal Vision — a book that, in contrast to Morris’s documentary, allows the facts to speak for themselves without editorialized ambiguity.

Ultimately, A Wilderness of Error is not a documentary about truth.It is a documentary about a director's aesthetic — a performance of investigative inquiry, not an act of inquiry itself.

The real tragedy is not that Morris misleads his audience.It is that by pretending the case remains a grand unsolved mystery, he blocks access to the far deeper psychological horror that lies at its center:the terrifying fact that a man can murder his entire family without apparent remorse, and then successfully pass himself off as a victim for decades.

In the end, Errol Morris doesn't clarify reality.He obscures it — and worse, he prettifies it — turning real suffering into just another stylish backdrop for his tired documentary tricks.

Circumscribed Psychopathy a By-product of Rawlsian Proceduralism
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 28

Lawyers are often accused of being indifferent to truth.This is not a personal defect.It is a structural consequence of the kind of legal system we have built.

In the American legal system, truth is not the goal.Procedure is the goal.Justice is defined not by outcomes, but by process.

An innocent man can be convicted, and the system is satisfied if the trial was procedurally sound.A guilty man can be acquitted, and the system is satisfied if the rules were followed.As Justice Scalia said, what matters is not innocence or guilt, but whether the accused was "well tried."

This is not a corruption of the legal system.It is the legal system operating exactly as designed.

Our legal system is not built on an epistemology of truth.It is built on a ritual of fairness, a public performance of formal equality.The deepest assumption is that no one—judge, jury, lawyer—can truly know the real facts.Therefore, all that matters is the integrity of the process itself.

John Rawls codified this outlook in political philosophy.Justice is a matter of procedures, not outcomes.We do not ask what is substantively just; we ask what is procedurally fair.

Lawyers are trained inside this system.They are trained to think procedurally, not factually.They are trained to align their sense of justice with admissibility, jurisdiction, evidentiary rules—not with reality.

Over time, this training deforms natural cognition.The innate human drive to seek the truth is suppressed.In its place is a trained loyalty to structures, standards, motions, objections, filings.The lawyer's mind learns not to care whether a thing is true.It learns only to care whether a thing is procedurally viable.

This deformation is not complete.Many lawyers still feel flashes of real moral outrage.But they must suppress it to function effectively within the system.To care about truth beyond procedure is professionally dangerous.It leads to mistakes, failures, ethical violations, and collapse.

Thus, lawyers display a circumscribed form of psychopathy.Not because they are evil.Not because they are weak.Because the system itself demands a mind that can ignore reality whenever reality is procedurally inconvenient.

The deeper point is simple.Our legal system does not merely tolerate cognitive mutilation.It requires it.

A lawyer who cares too much about truth becomes a danger to himself and to his clients.A lawyer who cares only about procedure thrives.

The legal mind, as we know it, is the natural and inevitable product of proceduralism.It was built this way.It is working exactly as intended.

The Cognitive Homology Between Mafiosi and Lawyers
John-Michael Kuczynski

In both organized crime and the legal profession, individuals undergo a deliberate suppression of basic human drives.The mafioso suppresses empathy.The lawyer suppresses truth-seeking.This is not an analogy.It is a homology: the same cognitive mechanism, applied to different instincts, under different survival pressures.

Human beings are built, biologically and cognitively, to seek truth and to feel empathy.The mafioso must kill or betray without hesitation.The lawyer must operate inside procedural systems where actual truth is irrelevant.In both cases, the natural drive—to care about others, to care about what is real—becomes an obstacle.

In the Mafia, survival requires compartmentalization.The mafioso learns to divide himself cleanly.He maintains loyalty, affection, and guilt toward family and friends, but shuts it off completely in matters of "business."Murder and betrayal are treated as operations, no different from collecting a debt or enforcing a contract.

In law, survival also requires compartmentalization.The lawyer learns not to ask, "What is true?" but "What procedures apply?"Innocence is not a legal concept.Facts are only marginally relevant.Only admissibility, evidence standards, and procedural fitness matter.A case may scream with obvious truth, but the lawyer is trained to treat that truth as irrelevant unless it aligns with procedural form.

The brain mechanisms involved are the same.The ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which integrates emotion and decision-making, is suppressed.The amygdala, the seat of emotional resonance, is bypassed or muted.The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which governs cold executive control, is strengthened.Compartmentalization becomes second nature: emotional facts and factual realities are treated as threats to procedural survival.

The deeper consequence is inevitable.Suppressing the truth drive erodes empathy.If one trains oneself not to care about what is real, one inevitably stops caring about what others feel.Truth-recognition and empathy are not separate functions.They are structurally intertwined.

Most lawyers are not psychopaths.But they simulate psychopathic patterns: strategic detachment, procedural loyalty over emotional loyalty, and a cultivated indifference to suffering unless it crosses into procedurally actionable domains.The same is true of mafiosi.They are not all born without feeling.But they amputate feeling where necessary, creating a mind that can kill or betray without personal collapse.

Lawyers and mafiosi differ in target and method.But they are built, cognitively, from the same structural mutilation:the suppression of natural instincts in favor of artificial survival rules.

This is not a rhetorical flourish.It is a forensic description of cognitive reality.

The ASMR Scam
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 24

ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, is widely promoted as a soothing, therapeutic phenomenon that triggers “tingles” and deep relaxation in some people through soft sounds, whispering, and gentle tapping. It is often framed as a mental health tool, a form of stress relief, or a kind of sensory meditation. But in truth, ASMR—at least as it overwhelmingly exists online—is a scam. It is soft-core pornography disguised as therapy, and it relies on a calculated form of cultural dishonesty to justify its existence and its popularity.

The most common form of ASMR content features a woman speaking in a barely audible whisper, often making wet, spittle-filled mouth noises directly into a microphone. These sounds are not just suggestive; they are transparently erotic in nature. They mimic the sounds associated with fellatio and other forms of intimate contact. The performances are tailored to male viewers and are steeped in submissive, infantilizing, and fetishistic undertones.

What makes this especially repellent is that the content does not admit what it is. Instead, it hides behind claims of therapeutic benefit or relaxation. It is a form of porn that refuses to name itself as such. This refusal is not incidental—it is the core of the appeal. ASMR allows users to indulge in erotic stimulation while maintaining plausible deniability. “I’m not watching porn,” the viewer can say. “I’m listening to something calming.” In this way, ASMR is not just dishonest—it is strategically dishonest.

This strategic dishonesty is supported by algorithms. TikTok, YouTube, and other platforms aggressively promote ASMR content because it generates views, comments, and prolonged engagement. The platforms do not care whether the content is honest, ethical, or meaningful. They care that it is addictive—and ASMR is addictive. It speaks directly to loneliness, sexual frustration, and a desire for comfort, all while pretending to be something else entirely. In doing so, it reduces intimacy to a product, and sincerity to a performance.

There is also a deeply gendered aspect to the ASMR phenomenon. The vast majority of ASMR content creators are women. The vast majority of their audience is male. This is not about individual preferences. It is about market incentives. Platforms reward female creators who adopt a submissive tone, who whisper, who roleplay as caretakers, nurses, or girlfriends. The content becomes a factory of feminine compliance—manufactured for consumption, and falsely branded as neutral.

It is no surprise, then, that people who do not respond to ASMR find it irritating or even revolting. The exaggerated intimacy, the cloying tone, and the childlike vocal affect all trigger a sense of unease in people with a sharper awareness of how manipulation works. There is something profoundly disturbing about watching performative tenderness packaged as therapy. It feels phony, because it is.

Worse still, ASMR has retroactively invented its legitimacy. It did not begin as a scientifically documented phenomenon. It began as a trend—a way for creators to generate clicks and for viewers to receive low-effort stimulation. Only after it gained traction did the hand-waving explanations about "tingles" and "meridian responses" emerge. The scientific literature remains inconclusive and thin. The supposed neurological basis for ASMR is shaky at best, and irrelevant in the face of what the content has actually become.

ASMR is not harmless. It is not profound. It is not therapeutic. It is a cheap, algorithm-friendly form of sexual gratification wrapped in a veil of fake innocence. It is designed to evade scrutiny and to mask arousal as self-care. It rewards creators for infantilizing themselves and rewards viewers for never having to admit what they’re really watching. In the end, ASMR is not about sound. It’s about shame—and the cultural mechanisms that allow people to avoid it.

If you find yourself repelled by ASMR, you are not wrong. You are not overreacting. You are simply recognizing that this kind of content is dishonest, manipulative, and, in a deeper way, a symptom of cultural decline. It is not the future of media. It is the bottom of the barrel.

Bullshit as Institutional Truth: A Refutation of Frankfurt's Bullshit Analysis of Bullshit
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 23

Updated: Apr 29

John-Michael Kuczynski

In his widely-read essay On Bullshit, Harry Frankfurt proposes a distinction between lies and bullshit that has come to dominate public discussion of the concept. According to Frankfurt, the liar is engaged with the truth, at least tacitly: he knows what is true and deliberately misrepresents it. The bullshitter, by contrast, is said to be indifferent to the truth altogether. He does not lie against the truth; rather, he operates in a vacuum where truth has no weight.

This account, though clever, is deeply flawed. It reflects the kind of insularity and moral blindness endemic to the institutionally unaccountable world from which Frankfurt wrote—a world in which truth is not discovered or defended, but performed. The real nature of bullshit has less to do with an individual’s orientation toward truth and more to do with the substitution of institutional truth for actual truth. Bullshit, properly understood, is not merely indifference to truth. It is the rhetorical performance of truth under conditions where truth is structurally excluded.

Bullshit vs. Lies
Suppose a man embezzles from his company and, when confronted, says, “I didn’t steal the money.” This is a lie. The speaker knows what he did and deliberately misrepresents it in order to avoid punishment. There is no confusion here: the truth is clear, and the lie directly contradicts it.

Now suppose a different case. A manager bypasses a competent job candidate in favor of a politically useful token hire—someone mediocre but strategically advantageous. When questioned, the manager says, “I hired him because of his qualifications.” Is this a lie? Perhaps. But more precisely, it is bullshit. The statement exists not to assert a proposition about the world, but to uphold a pretense—that the system is meritocratic, fair, and rational. It invokes the language of truth while replacing its content with something else: a ritual affirmation of institutional legitimacy.

Bullshit as the Ritual of Legitimacy
This is the essential function of bullshit: it is the mask that institutional power wears when it wants to appear just. It is the voice of a judge who issues a politically driven ruling and attributes it to “statutory obligation.” It is the press release that invokes “transparency” after a cover-up. It is the academic who parrots empty slogans about “rigor” and “scholarship” in service of a self-contained intellectual hierarchy that answers to nothing outside itself.

These are not lies in the usual sense. They do not hinge on the distinction between truth and falsehood, because they operate at a level where that distinction has already been hollowed out. They are gestures, not assertions—gestures of truthfulness, offered in bad faith.

Frankfurt’s error lies in treating bullshit as a psychological attitude rather than a structural practice. He sees the bullshitter as someone too lazy or cynical to care about truth. But this is only a symptom. The deeper pathology is that truth has been replaced by institutional proxies—by formulas, credentials, procedural justifications, and euphemistic abstractions that allow power to simulate neutrality.

Institutional Truth as Bullshit
The proper definition of bullshit, then, is this:

Bullshit is what happens when institutional truth replaces actual truth.
This encompasses a wide variety of phenomena: legal fictions that justify injustice, bureaucratic language that conceals failure, identity-performance that masquerades as achievement. What unites them is not their relation to propositional truth, but their function: to maintain the appearance of legitimacy in a system that no longer depends on actual merit, reason, or accountability.

The consequences are not merely intellectual. In a world governed by bullshit, critique becomes impossible, because every objection is answered by reference to the institution’s own internal logic. One cannot protest injustice in a courtroom where the judge insists that “the statute required it.” One cannot protest incompetence in a university where every sinecure-holder is said to have “met the standards.” In such a world, bullshit is not the exception; it is the medium through which truth is filtered and neutralized.

Frankfurt’s Blind Spot
That Frankfurt missed this is no accident. He spent his career in a tightly knit, self-legitimating academic culture, where rhetorical conformity masqueraded as intellectual rigor. He was, in a sense, describing bullshit from within the belly of the beast—but he lacked the cynicism required to recognize it. His essay is not itself bullshit—its aims are earnest—but it fails to grasp the systemic nature of the phenomenon it seeks to define.

Bullshit is not the abandonment of truth. It is the triumph of institutionalized fiction, weaponized to mimic truth while shielding its operators from accountability. It is what keeps corrupt systems running smoothly under the guise of propriety. To call it “indifference to truth” is not only insufficient; it is, ironically, a form of bullshit.

Law School Makes You Dumber
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 22
7 min read

Updated: Apr 30

There is a lie — a colossal and quietly ruinous lie — that circulates with particular tenacity in the United States and other Western nations. It is so common, so automatic, that even people who should know better repeat it with reverent confidence. The lie is this:That legal education teaches you how to think.

The claim is not just mistaken. It is diametrically false. Legal education does not sharpen the intellect — it blunts it. It does not cultivate truth-seeking — it conditions obedience. It does not clarify reality — it trains you to look away from it. It is, in fact, a system whose core design is to cripple independent judgment while masquerading as a rigorous form of reasoning.

Let us unpack why this is not simply a mistake, but one of the most intellectually destructive myths our society perpetuates.

I. Law Is Not About Truth
At the heart of the myth is a fundamental misunderstanding of what law is. People assume that because laws deal with important topics — justice, rights, liberty — that legal education must be deeply philosophical or morally serious. It is not. The law, as taught and practiced in most common law systems, is not about what is true or what is right. It is about what is procedurally permitted.

In law school, you are not taught to ask:

Is this man actually guilty?

What actually happened here?

What is the just outcome?

You are explicitly trained not to ask those questions. Instead, you are taught to ask:

What does precedent say?

What statutory interpretation applies?

Were the correct procedures followed?

In other words, the concept of truth is entirely bracketed. You are told, in a thousand subtle and unsubtle ways, that truth is not your job. That the system has no mechanism to recognize truth when it arrives. That your role is to be a technician — to identify procedural errors, to classify events according to precedent, to argue from within the system’s hermetically sealed logic. This is not an accident. It is the design.

II. Legal Reasoning Is Procedural, Not Intellectual
Law school does not teach critical thinking. It teaches procedural fluency. It is not a method for interrogating reality — it is a system for navigating an artificial code.

Think of it like this: imagine a vast game of chess, but one in which the pieces represent people’s lives, and the rules are arbitrarily set in stone. Now imagine training an entire professional class not to ask, Should this be the rule? or Is this person’s suffering just? but rather to master the mechanics of the game — to know which pieces can move when, to exploit loopholes, to win cases without ever asking if the outcome is good, or even true.

That is legal reasoning.

And it is not intellectual in any meaningful sense. It is clerical, performative, and rule-bound. The lawyer does not seek truth; he seeks admissibility. He does not strive to understand the moral character of the case; he checks whether forms were filed correctly.

This kind of thinking is not neutral. It is actively corrosive to intellectual life. It rewires the brain away from philosophical curiosity and toward bureaucratic maneuvering. It punishes originality. It rewards cunning without insight.

III. Law School Destroys the Thinking Instinct
Legal education doesn’t merely fail to enhance thought. It actively destroys it. Here’s how.

First, it severs the connection between language and reality. Legal education trains you to speak in technical abstractions that often obscure more than they reveal. In a law classroom, a human tragedy becomes "a question of proximate cause." A police shooting becomes "a matter of qualified immunity." The words are meant to drain the blood out of the event, to make it manageable — to make it procedural.

Second, it rewards amoral cleverness. The best law students are those who can manipulate doctrine most deftly — not those who think most clearly, or feel most deeply. To succeed is to master the system’s internal logic, not to question whether that logic is just, or humane, or even coherent.

Third, it inculcates a submissive posture toward authority. Precedent is sacrosanct. Judicial opinion is scripture. The law school classroom trains you to interpret and apply received wisdom, not to critique it. This is not education. This is indoctrination.

The result is a kind of intellectual lobotomy: graduates who may be articulate, but cannot think independently. Who may be skilled at argument, but have no internal compass. Who can reason from premises, but cannot evaluate the premises themselves.

IV. The Prestige Machine and the Hunger for Legitimacy
Why does this lie survive? Because law school offers something seductive to a particular kind of person: the intellectually insecure striver.

To someone who suspects they are intelligent but lacks a clear path to prove it, law school is a lifeline. It is credentialism disguised as enlightenment. It offers a shortcut to prestige, to social authority, to being taken seriously.

But the actual content of the education rarely delivers on that promise. Ask a first-year law student why they came, and they will often talk in lofty terms:

"I want to fight for justice."

"I want to shape public policy."

"I want to write the new constitution of Iraq."

These are not the ambitions of lawyers. These are the dreams of statesmen, philosophers, political theorists — none of which law school prepares you for. The gap between the myth and the reality is so large that it must be filled with an equally enormous performance of seriousness. Hence the prestige. Hence the robes. Hence the reverence.

V. Law as a Blinding Mechanism
There is something darker still. Legal training does not just ignore truth. It often actively blinds the practitioner to it.

In real courtrooms, judges routinely allow innocent men to rot in jail for procedural failures. A missed deadline, a badly formatted motion, an overworked public defender — and a man’s life is gone. Everyone in the room may know the defendant is innocent. But that knowledge is useless if the procedure says otherwise.

This is not a bug in the system. This is the system.And it trains its acolytes to accept such outcomes without flinching — to call them "lawful" and move on.

If this sounds monstrous, it is. And it is made worse by the belief — still held by many — that the system is fundamentally noble. That law is what separates civilization from barbarism. That lawyers are the guardians of justice.

In reality, the legal system is often the instrument of injustice, and lawyers are trained to accept — and even celebrate — that role, as long as the procedural forms have been obeyed.

VI. The Fingerprint Illusion: Law as Cultural Mirror?
Another lie frequently attached to the legal profession is the idea that a country’s laws somehow reflect its cultural soul — that you can "read a nation" by studying its legal system.

But this too collapses under scrutiny.

Strip away the names and some superficial differences, and most modern legal systems — especially in the West — are nearly interchangeable. You could hand someone the statutes of Panama and tell them they were from Iceland, and they’d be none the wiser.

Far from being fingerprints, modern legal systems are mass-produced templates. They are algorithmic frameworks for managing people, designed more for standardization than expression. They are more akin to operating systems than national creeds.

The real cultural soul of a nation lives elsewhere: in its literature, its language, its everyday customs — not in the bloodless prose of legal code.

VII. What Law School Really Teaches
Law school doesn’t teach you how to think. It teaches you how to submit without resistance to institutional logic. It teaches you to equate cleverness with wisdom, precedent with truth, and technical compliance with justice. It trains you not to see what is plainly in front of you if the system doesn’t authorize it.

It teaches you to wear your own de-intellectualization as a badge of honor — to call it “thinking like a lawyer.”

This is not a framework for understanding the world. It is a toolkit for maneuvering through a bureaucracy that does not care whether the world is understood. In this sense, legal education is not simply vacuous — it is anti-intellectual at its core. It replaces judgment with rules, discernment with deferral, and truth with admissibility.

VIII. The Consequences: A Culture of Castrated Thinking
The result is a culture in which some of the most powerful people — judges, politicians, corporate lawyers — are trained to avoid independent judgment at all costs. They are intelligent people who have been taught not to use their intelligence, except in the narrowest, most system-serving ways.

They are not thinkers. They are functionaries.

And because the legal profession cloaks itself in the garb of seriousness, of rigor, of constitutional gravity, this anti-thinking posture is not seen as a flaw — it is seen as elite sophistication. That is the genius — and the horror — of the lie. The law doesn’t just blunt the mind. It convinces you it’s sharpening it.

IX. The Real Study of Law: A Separate Discipline
To be clear, there is a legitimate, intellectually serious field that studies law: it is called legal philosophy, or jurisprudence, or comparative legal anthropology. It is practiced by philosophers, theorists, and critical legal scholars. It asks real questions:

What is justice?

What makes a law legitimate?

What are the hidden ideologies embedded in the structure of legal systems?

But that has nothing to do with what lawyers are trained to do. The gap between these two worlds — the world of legal theory and the world of legal practice — is vast and unbridgeable. It is the difference between critique and compliance.

Conclusion: The Most Destructive Lie
The myth that legal education teaches you how to think is not just wrong. It is one of the most destructive lies we tell in a society that prizes credentials over insight, and compliance over truth. It elevates a form of bureaucratic gamesmanship to the level of intellectual virtue, and in doing so, it undermines the very possibility of real judgment, real justice, and real thinking.

A law degree is not an intellectual achievement. It is, at best, a kind of elite trade certification. At worst, it is a slow-motion intellectual lobotomy, disguised as enlightenment.

And the sooner we recognize this — and stop rewarding it with unearned reverence — the closer we will come to a society where actual thought, not procedural sleight of hand, holds sway.

The Gifted Child Canard: Mom's Way of Filling a Hole (Literally)
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 22
5 min read

I want to talk about something that I find viscerally irritating, and I suspect I’m not the only one: the myth of the “gifted child.” Not the existence of actual giftedness — sure, some kids are unusually good at music or math, and maybe that’s a meaningful distinction. No, I’m talking about the concept, the label, and especially the narrative — the one that plays out endlessly in places like Quora, where I used to write a lot and inevitably ended up reading other people's posts. And time after time, I’d run into the same tired script: a mother breathlessly describing her “gifted” son, usually under the thin disguise of seeking advice, but really just issuing a humblebrag disguised as a cry for help.

What struck me wasn’t just the repetition. It was the emotional texture of these posts. They weren’t about the child at all. They were about the mother’s need to feel important — her need to be validated, her need to turn child-rearing into a spiritual vocation or a political cause. The child, in these scenarios, becomes a proxy — a puppet performing her unmet longings and ambitions.

Let me say this clearly: I don’t blame the kid. The child is usually the victim here. If anything, the “gifted” child is being weaponized. He becomes the mother’s identity, her status marker, her proof that she matters in a world where she’s otherwise emotionally starving.

1. The Gifted Child as Proxy for the Mother’s Unmet Needs
There’s something compulsive about the way these mothers describe their children. It’s not the calm pride of a parent who knows her kid is smart. It’s the agitated evangelism of someone trying to convince herself of something. “My son is reading The Odyssey in second grade.” “My daughter taught herself Mandarin.” These aren’t just facts. They’re claims to spiritual importance. The mother isn’t saying, “My child is gifted.” She’s saying, “I am important — I matter — because this magical child emerged from me.”

It’s narcissism by proxy. Not Munchausen-by-proxy in the usual way (where the parent exaggerates the child’s illness), but its flipped mirror image: exaggerating the child’s exceptionality. And this proxy narcissism is often covering something deeper — a gnawing, unspoken hunger that has nothing to do with IQ points and everything to do with unfulfilled personal identity.

2. The Father’s Absence Makes the Myth Possible
And here's the thing: I almost never see these kinds of posts written by fathers. I’m sure they exist, but they’re vanishingly rare. This whole “gifted child” mythology thrives in the absence of strong, involved fathers. Not abusive fathers, not authoritarian fathers — just fathers who actually teach their kids things, who treat child-rearing as a process of skill transmission, not label assignment.

When a father is teaching his son how to fix a sink, plant a tree, or navigate social situations, there’s no need to declare the child “gifted.” The child is learning, developing, contributing. The focus is on doing, not on being. Labels like “gifted” have no place in that world. They’re superfluous.

But in families where the father is emotionally or physically absent — or has been pushed to the periphery of child-rearing — the child becomes the center of maternal fantasy. Instead of being someone to be developed, he becomes someone to be interpreted. He becomes a canvas on which the mother paints her hopes, her frustrations, her need to be seen.

3. Giftedness as a Class Marker
There’s also a sociological component to all this. The label “gifted” is almost never used in working-class contexts. It’s a middle- and upper-middle-class signifier. It’s part of a class performance. Instead of saying, “My child has a trust fund,” or “We live in the right zip code,” you say, “My child is in the gifted program.” It’s the same thing. It’s distinction signaling.

“Gifted” doesn’t mean anything scientifically rigorous. It’s not a diagnosis. It’s not a prognosis. It’s a floating term, a vessel into which parents pour whatever content they need to feel better about themselves. It gives them something to say at dinner parties. It gives them something to fight for in PTA meetings. It turns their child into a cause — and by extension, turns them into heroes.

4. Standard Metrics of Giftedness Are Narrow and Misleading
IQ tests, gifted & talented assessments, early admissions — they all rely on proxies for intelligence that are shallow, rigid, and mostly irrelevant to real life. These tests measure fluency, pattern recognition, working memory. That’s it. And those are valuable skills, sure. But they’re a narrow slice of what real-world intelligence actually looks like.

Real-world intelligence is recursive. It’s intuitive. It involves social navigation, emotional calibration, adaptability, patience, timing, the ability to withhold action just as much as the ability to act. None of that is captured in these so-called assessments. The kids who test as “gifted” are usually early-developing, neurotic, compliant, and praised for playing the game well. That’s not the same thing as being brilliant.

And you know what happens to most of them? Nothing. They peak in tenth grade. They become anxious, rigid adults. Or worse — they become mediocre adults who believe they were cheated out of greatness.

5. The Sexual Displacement No One Talks About
Now we come to the taboo part — the part that everyone knows but no one dares say: these mothers who obsessively post about their gifted children often seem emotionally ravenous. Not just lonely — hungry. And when women are emotionally hungry, it’s often because they’re sexually hungry.

When men are sexually hungry, they deal with it in cruder, more direct ways — porn, masturbation, random flings. But when a woman is sexually unsatisfied, it doesn’t always register in the body. It registers in the narrative. It registers in the causes she adopts, the fixations she develops. And the “gifted child” is the perfect vessel for that energy. He becomes her project, her symptom, her surrogate partner. Not in any literal or abusive way — but in a psychological and emotional one.

Her unmet needs are poured into the child. And in doing so, she freezes him in place — makes him into a sacred object that she cannot allow to grow up or defy her.

So what are we left with?

A child who never asked for any of this. A boy (usually) who’s being paraded around like a genius when really he’s just a high-functioning, possibly neurotic kid with a mother who is trying to fill a hole in her life. A father who’s absent or marginalized. A culture that rewards performance over substance. And a label — “gifted” — that does more to harm than to help.

There is such a thing as real giftedness. But it doesn’t look like what these mothers are describing. And it doesn’t announce itself on Quora.

The Problem of Friction: Why Procedural Justice Breaks in the Real World
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 22
2 min read

There’s another, deeper reason why proceduralism—the Rawlsian kind in particular—isn’t just wrong in principle but dangerous in practice.

You’ve heard the saying: No plan survives first contact with the enemy. Or in business: No business plan survives the first day in business. The point, of course, is that reality has a way of steamrolling even the most elegant designs. Unpredictable contingencies—what Clausewitz called “friction”—inevitably arise, and systems that can’t flex, fail.

Now imagine a justice system built entirely on proceduralism. The judge doesn’t ask what’s right. He asks whether the rules were followed. There is no override, no “get real” clause. There is only the machinery of the system, ticking along as if moral reality were a mere detail.

Unless that system is perfect—which it never is—it’s going to malfunction. Maybe not catastrophically every time, but certainly and inevitably in specific cases. That’s not speculation. That’s statistical certainty.

If the rules don't allow for real-time discretion, they will produce injustices—not because anyone is cheating or being malicious, but because the rules themselves cannot anticipate the infinite complexity of real life. The world is full of edge cases, exceptions, flukes, and tragedies. A system that cannot respond to them is not a justice system. It’s a meat grinder.

To be clear: procedures matter. Scalability demands them. A purely intuitive or discretionary legal system cannot function at the scale of a modern nation-state. But there must be a built-in recognition of their limits. There must be space within the architecture of justice for judgment—for the reality that fairness sometimes means breaking the rules when the rules, by accident or design, are about to crush someone unjustly.

Rawlsian proceduralism has no such provision. It imagines a world where if you design the game correctly at the outset—under a veil of ignorance—everything else will work out. But real life is not a simulation. It’s chaos interrupted briefly by structure. And if your structure can’t accommodate that chaos, it will eventually become indistinguishable from injustice.

Procedural justice, without substantive override, is like a self-driving car with no steering wheel: it works beautifully—until it doesn’t. And when it doesn’t, someone gets run over.



Apples and Oranges in Macroeconomics: A Quiet Error with Loud Consequences
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 8
3 min read

Updated: Apr 10



My uncle, once a mathematician and now an economist, recently made an intriguing—and slightly opaque—comment about macroeconomic policy. He said that it is often vitiated by a kind of conceptual confusion: the belief that instantaneous variables (like prices) can be straightforwardly read off of non-instantaneous variables (like GDP growth over a year). This, he said, leads to subtle but foundational misjudgments in policymaking—especially by central banks and treasury departments.

It’s a technical-sounding point, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that it mattered. So I asked him about it, and here’s what I pieced together—with some help from a deeper dive into economics, physics, and epistemology.

🧩 Instantaneous vs. Non-Instantaneous Variables
Let’s start with the basic distinction.

Instantaneous variables: Prices, interest rates, inflation at a given moment. Think: “What’s the price of oil right now?”

Non-instantaneous variables: Aggregated over time. GDP over a year, unemployment rate over a quarter, inflation over 12 months.

These are fundamentally different kinds of data: one is a snapshot, the other is a summary over time. Mathematically, they are the difference between a point and an integral, or a derivative and an average.

But in macroeconomics, these two types of variables are often blurred together.

🏛️ The Category Error
When central banks make decisions based on recent GDP growth or year-over-year inflation, they are often using lagging, time-smeared aggregates to infer or control instantaneous conditions in the economy. For example:

“GDP growth was 2.5% last year and inflation is still high → the economy is overheating → raise interest rates.”
But that GDP number includes economic activity from 12 months ago. It says very little about what’s happening now, or how prices are behaving today. The price level, an instantaneous variable, doesn’t cleanly derive from the GDP growth rate, a long-term aggregate.

This is what my uncle was pointing to: a deep confusion of levels. And when that confusion informs policy, it can lead to miscalibrated interventions, like raising rates just as inflation is softening.

📡 A Parallel in Physics
This isn’t just an economic issue—it has a counterpart in physics.

In kinematics, you can’t infer instantaneous velocity from average speed.

In thermodynamics, trying to define local temperature based on system-wide averages is often meaningless.

In quantum mechanics, the expectation value (a statistical average) doesn’t tell you what a particle is doing at a given instant.

In electrodynamics, the electric field at a point now depends not on the present state of a charge, but on its past motion (retarded potentials).

So physics, which demands tight conceptual hygiene, has long recognized that you can’t deduce a moment from a mean. Economics, by contrast, often still tries.

🤔 So Where Does This Distinction Fit in Economics?
Here’s the interesting part. While it’s a valid and important distinction, most economic predictions—e.g., “There will be a recession next year” or “Tariffs will cripple the economy”—are judged right or wrong based on empirical facts, not on whether the forecaster properly categorized variables.

So you might ask: is this just an ivory-tower concern?

Actually, no.

This distinction doesn’t usually affect the forecast, but it affects the models and the policy frameworks that generate the forecasts and responses. Here’s where it fits:

Layer

Function of the Variable-Type Distinction

Forecasting

Minor — often overshadowed by empirical judgment

Model Construction

Crucial — misclassifying variables undermines model validity

Post-Hoc Diagnostics

Important — helps explain why models or policies misfired

Epistemology

Foundational — pertains to what kind of knowledge economics can claim

Policy Design

Critical — prevents flawed interventions based on mismatched timescales

In other words, it’s not front-page stuff, but it’s load-bearing architecture. If you build policy or theory without it, you may not notice—until something cracks.

🧠 Where My Uncle Got It
This distinction isn’t standard-issue macroeconomics. It’s more likely something my uncle brought with him from his mathematical training, where the difference between a point and an integral is second nature, and category errors are immediately spotted.

Macroeconomics tends to prioritize models that use aggregates—GDP, CPI, etc.—and often doesn’t rigorously distinguish between temporal categories. So unless you have a formal background in math or physics, you might never even see the issue.

But once you do, it changes how you look at everything—from the shape of economic models to the logic of policy responses.

📌 Conclusion
The confusion between instantaneous and non-instantaneous variables may seem like an academic footnote, but it quietly underlies many of the errors and incoherencies in modern macroeconomic modeling and policy.

If economists and policymakers were more careful about these distinctions—if they treated inflation, price, and output as variables with different temporal and conceptual structures—we might get better models, better diagnostics, and less erratic policy.

As my uncle, with quiet exasperation, put it:

“They’re trying to read the clock by averaging over the calendar.”

The Real Reason Professors Fear AI
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 10
2 min read

By John-Michael Kuczynski

Academics claim to be worried about AI for all the usual reasons: ethical implications, misinformation, student plagiarism, epistemic laziness. But these are surface-level objections—publicly acceptable proxies for a deeper, more disturbing fear.

The real fear? AI threatens to reveal how much of academic work is sophisticated recycling.

Professors accuse AI of mindless regurgitation. But that’s what most of academia already is.

And now AI does it better.

The Academy Has Always Recycled
Most academic writing is not original thought. It is structured iteration:

Commentaries on existing frameworks

Safe adjustments within dominant paradigms

Ritual performances of citation and compliance

PhD dissertations are usually extensive literature reviews with a narrow twist. Peer-reviewed articles often boil down to: "Here’s a minor variant of a well-known idea, dressed in jargon and backstopped by references."

This isn’t a failure of individual scholars. It’s how the system is built: reward structure, publishing incentives, departmental politics. Innovation is rare, and when it happens, it's often punished for being too disruptive.

But now AI has made the whole thing visible.

The Mirror Nobody Asked For
AI doesn’t pretend to innovate. It synthesizes. It remixes. It builds coherent outputs based on vast corpora of prior material. It does what most academics do—only faster, more transparently, and often more clearly.

What happens when we realize that the cutting-edge paper just published in a top journal is, statistically, a marginal rearrangement of existing concepts that AI could have generated in 30 seconds?

What happens when we stop being able to distinguish between human and machine authors—not because the machine is brilliant, but because the human was recycling?

Plagiarism, Redefined
The current discourse around AI fixates on plagiarism: students using chatbots to write essays. But that’s the small stuff.

The big question is: What happens when we apply AI to audit the academic system itself?

We can now:

Detect semantic compression ratios (how much real content is in a 10,000-word paper?)

Measure derivativeness through statistical comparison to prior literature

Quantify conceptual novelty in probabilistic terms

And when we apply these tools, we’ll find that vast swaths of scholarly output are statistical clones of what came before.

The term "derivative" will no longer be a qualitative jab. It will be a measurable property.

The Real Panic
Academics are afraid not that AI will cheat. They’re afraid that AI will reveal the cheating already embedded in the system:

The performance of originality

The inflation of significance

The ritualized dressing-up of well-trodden ideas

AI can now generate this kind of content on command. But more importantly, it can now detect it.

The plagiarism panic isn’t about protecting knowledge. It’s about protecting prestige systems built on rhetorical opacity.

And when those systems are audited by the very tools they fear, the illusion of originality crumbles.

Final Thought
AI didn’t invent derivative thought. It just made it impossible to hide.

And that’s why professors are really afraid.


Why Dictators Wear Tunics
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 21
2 min read

In democratic societies, politicians must perform relatability. Their clothing becomes a kind of soft theater: a red tie here, a rolled-up sleeve there, a flag pin over the heart. These gestures matter. They communicate that the wearer is one of us, that he shares our values, that he might, at any moment, walk into a diner and ask for a black coffee and a slice of pie. In short: democratic leaders must seduce. They must perform.

Dictators do not seduce. They declare. And the tunic—its stark, severe lines, its utilitarian shape—declares perfectly. It is not merely a costume. It is the visual embodiment of a psychological regime. It says: I am not here to be liked. I am here to control.

Consider Stalin, Mao, or Kim Jong-un. Their aesthetic is minimalist, functional, and uniform. The tunic erases the body, denying shape and seduction. It is clothing as architecture: rigid, inexpressive, symmetrical. There are no loose ends, no fidgety elements, no soft textures. Everything is smoothed over, flattened. Even villains in fiction, like Dr. Evil from Austin Powers, wear tunics—because the tunic is shorthand for authoritarian control. It suggests that the wearer has no use for flair, only for function.

This is not an absence of sexuality, but a specific, hyper-masculinized form of it. In liberal societies, political men temper their masculinity with feminine cues—soft colors, expressive accessories, even slightly longer hair. This is necessary to perform openness, emotional intelligence, and relatability. A man like Donald Trump, despite his bombast, is flamboyant and theatrical. His long tie, bright complexion, and exaggerated gestures all say: Look at me. React to me.

But the dictator’s sexuality is different. It is anti-feminine, unyielding, and functional. It is domination without seduction. The tunic expresses this perfectly. It is not anti-sexual, but it is anti-relational. There is no invitation in the tunic. There is only command.

This is why the idea of a dictator in a bow tie is laughable. The bow tie is the visual opposite of the tunic. It is small, ornamental, and faintly ridiculous. It suggests playfulness, wit, individuality. It’s associated with professors, jazz musicians, and old-fashioned southern lawyers. In American politics, it has occasionally surfaced—think Paul Tsongas, or the early days of Tucker Carlson. But it has never touched authoritarian power. It cannot. It’s too soft. Too self-conscious. Too ironic.

The bow tie signals an inward-facing power—the power of thought, eccentricity, and style. The tunic signals outward-facing power—the power of imposition, finality, and command. The bow tie says, "Let's talk." The tunic says, "You will obey."

In sum, clothing is not just clothing. It is semiotic warfare. It is psychological architecture. And in politics, what one wears is never merely about taste. It is about ontology. The tunic is not just anti-fashion. It is anti-personality, anti-negotiation, anti-nuance. It projects the dream of the total system—the dream of being the state itself. The bow tie, by contrast, is the whisper of a plural world—a world of individuality, irony, and the right to look ridiculous.

And so: the dictator wears the tunic, and the democrat wears the tie. Or, on rare and eccentric days, the bow tie.


Husserl=Schizophrenic Drivel
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 20
3 min read

Edmund Husserl, founder of phenomenology and patron saint of the Continental tradition, remains a revered figure among certain academic circles. His name carries philosophical gravitas; his works, particularly Logical Investigations, are cited as milestones in the development of 20th-century thought. Yet a close and honest reading of Husserl does not reveal a rigorous philosophical system so much as a mind unraveling under the guise of philosophical precision.

This is not a claim of casual insult. It is, rather, an attempt to call attention to the central affective and cognitive structure of Husserl's method—a structure that bears a disturbing resemblance to the phenomenology of schizophrenia. The goal of this paper is to explore the proposition that Husserl's philosophy is not merely flawed or obscure, but in fact reflects a disintegrative mental pattern, one that can be meaningfully described in terms of psychopathology.

I. Madness Disguised as Method
Husserl’s project famously turns on the epoché—the "bracketing" of all natural and theoretical assumptions to access the pure structures of consciousness. The idea, in short, is to suspend belief in the external world and analyze experience as it is "given" in consciousness. But this pure "givenness" turns out to be nothing of the sort. What Husserl calls the given is not the immediate flow of perception, mood, or thought. It is an abstract residue arrived at only after a lengthy ritual of self-alienation.

True givenness is immediate, affect-laden, noisy, structured by sentiment and habit. What Husserl arrives at is not the given but a synthetic, post-processed, cleansed artifact. His method does not discover a foundation—it manufactures one. Worse: it then re-labels that artifact as primordial truth. This is not conceptual clarity. It is, in Orwellian fashion, the inversion of the terms. The constructed is called the given. The obliterated is called the real.

II. The Schizophrenic Core
This is not just a conceptual failing. It is symptomatic. The recursive, meandering, and pathologically qualified nature of Husserl’s prose suggests a mind caught in a feedback loop of self-monitoring. In classic schizophrenia, the subject loses a stable distinction between what is internally generated and what is received. Meaning fragments; the structures that give sense to experience are destabilized. What remains is the desperate attempt to rebuild a coherent self—often through obsessive conceptualization.

Husserl’s writings radiate that same compulsion: a drive to peel back every layer of cognition until only a sterile remnant remains. The reader is told, again and again, to eliminate all assumptions—then all categories—then all conceptual frames—until, finally, one reaches a "pure" vantage point which is in fact only reachable through exhaustive mental disassembly. But instead of exposing the foundations of thought, this process obliterates them. The mind becomes an object to itself, paralyzed by recursive scrutiny.

Husserl’s project, in this reading, is not just philosophical—it is therapeutic in the pathological sense. It is the record of a psyche trying to hold itself together under the strain of its own hypertrophied lucidity. It is a philosophy born not of conceptual insight but of cognitive distress.

III. Why It Still Persists
So why is Husserl still revered?

First, because of genealogy. Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Sartre all cite him. Dislodge Husserl and you destabilize the canon.

Second, because of aesthetics. Phenomenological writing often sounds profound. Its deliberate vagueness, its repetition, its ambiguity—they create a fog mistaken for depth. Students and scholars alike are seduced by the feel of profundity.

Third, because institutions reward hermeticism. Complexity becomes a sign of importance. To admit that Husserl might be not merely mistaken but ill is to admit that entire departments, conferences, and intellectual traditions have been chasing the symptom of a broken mind.

IV. Philosophy and Clarity
Philosophy must clarify, not mystify. It must illuminate reality—not efface it in the name of a mythic purity. Husserl fails this test not because he was a poor thinker, but because he was not thinking in the usual sense at all. He was documenting a disintegration. The Logical Investigations are not logical and they are not investigative. They are the byproduct of a mind caught in its own collapse, and the tradition that reveres them is, at some level, colluding in that collapse.

To read Husserl honestly is not to discover a method. It is to witness an implosion. And to mistake that implosion for insight is perhaps the deepest philosophical error of all.

Numbers as Ordered Pairs
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 20
3 min read

by John-Michael Kuczynski 


Abstract: According to Frege, n=Kn, where n is any cardinal number and Kn is the class of all n-tuples. According to Von Neumann, n=Kpn, where Kpn is the class of all of n's predecessors. These analyses are prima facie incompatible with each other, given that Kn≠Kpn, for n>0. In the present paper it is shown that these analyses are in fact compatible with each other, for the reason that each analysis can and ultimately must be interpreted as being to the effect that n=Cn, where Cn is the class of all ordered pairs <Kn#,Rn#>, where Kn# is an arbitrary class and Rn# is an arbitrary relation such that a class k has n-many members exactly if k bears Rn# to Kn#.

 

 According to Frege, the cardinal number n is Kn, where Kn is the class of all n-tuples. (Thus, Ø=0; K1=1; K2=2; and so on.) According to Von Neumann, the cardinal number n is Kpn, where Kpn is the class of all of n's predecessors. (Thus, Ø=0; {Ø}=1; {Ø,{Ø}}=2; and so on.)

 These analyses seem to be incompatible, given that Kn≠Kpn, for n>0. At the same time, each analysis is viable, given that the content of any statement of the form "…n…" is perspicuously represented---i.e. represented in such a way that its inferential properties can be read off of its syntax---by some statement of the form "… Kn…" and also by some statement of the form "…Kpn…". We thus have a paradox: Kn≠Kpn and yet n=Kn and n=Kpn.

 In an attempt to deal with this paradox, some philosophers have taken the desperate measure of saying that numbers, and therefore relations among numbers, do not exist mind-independently. Those authors who have rejected this position have failed to identify an entity with which a given cardinal number both can and must be identified.  

 We will now identify just such an entity.

 Frege's analysis can be interpreted as being given by the proposition that, for any cardinal n, n=<Kn,∈>, where ∈ is the relation between class-member and class; and Von Neumann's analysis can be interpreted as being given by the proposition that n=<Kpn,≈>, where ≈ is the relation between set and equipollent set. Thus, if KJ is the class of John's cars, then Frege's analysis maps (i) John has exactly one car onto (ii) KJ∈K1, whereas Von Neumann's analysis maps (i) onto (iii) KJ≈Kp1.

 This suggests that, for any cardinal n, n can be identified with the class Cn of all ordered pairs <Kn#,Rn#>, where Kn# is any class and Rn# is any relation such that a class k has n-many members exactly if kRn#Kn# (read: k bears Rn# to Kn#). Thus, 0=C0={<K0#,R0#>│(k) (kR0#K0#↔k∈K0)}, where K0={k│(x) (x∈k↔x≈Ø)}; 1=C1= {<K1#,R1#>│(k) (kR1#K1#↔k∈K1)}, where K1={k│(x) (x∈k↔x≈{Ø})}; 2=C2= {<K2#,R2#>│(k) (kR2#K2#↔k∈K2)}, where K2={k│(x)(x∈k↔x≈{Ø, {Ø}})}; and so on.

 Given an ordered pair <K,R>, let us use the notation <K,R>n to indicate that <K,R> is an n-pair, meaning that a class k is an n-tuple iff kRK. For example, <K,R>2 ↔(k≈Kp2↔kRK). ("<K,R> is a 2-pair exactly if k's bearing R to K is necessary and sufficient for k's having two members.") For any cardinal n, Cn is the smallest class containing every n-pair. Each of <Kpn,≈> and <Kn,∈> is an n-pair, and there are obviously others. What each Cn-member <x,y> has in common with each of <Kn,∈> and <Kpn,≈> is that <x,y> represents n's structure and is thus, as we might put it, an n-isomorph. Since nothing that isn't in Cn is an n-isomorph, membership in Cn is both necessary and sufficient for possession of the structural properties, and therefore of all of the properties, that are individuative of n. Therefore, a given cardinal n not only can but must be identified with Cn. Therefore, n=Cn={<x,y>│<x,y>n}.

 For any cardinal number n, n=Cn. This analysis is consistent with the fact that any n-pair adequately represents n's structure and also with the fact that any adequate representation of n's structure is an n-pair. But unlike the analyses of Frege and Von Neumann, our analysis is consistent with the presumption that there is only one entity that can be identified with n.


Emotional Detachment as a Defense Against Empathic Overload
John-Michael Kuczynski

It’s often assumed that emotional detachment signals a lack of empathy. We meet someone seemingly indifferent to others’ feelings, and we read that coolness as a deficit. But in many cases—particularly among people with high cognitive and emotional acuity—emotional detachment is not a deficit at all. It’s a defense, a coping mechanism developed in response to an excess of empathic input.

Put simply:

Some people appear emotionally blind not because they feel too little—but because they feel too much.
This post explores that idea in depth. It’s not a theory of pathology, but a theory of psychic adaptation—especially among individuals who once operated in highly empathic modes but have since shifted toward more solitary or analytical work.

The Core Generalization
Let’s state the idea as precisely as possible:

Apparent emotional detachment is often a functional strategy used by individuals who are hyper-aware of others’ emotional states, but who have had to “turn down” that awareness to avoid psychic overload.
Rather than being a sign of coldness, this detachment is frequently the byproduct of over-stimulation, emotional exhaustion, or a conscious need to preserve focus in domains that reward abstraction over attunement.

It is a form of self-preserving blindness, and it is often reversible—though not always easily.

Why This Happens: Three Mechanisms
1. Affective Load as Cognitive Load
Emotions aren’t just things we feel. They’re also things we process—interpret, weigh, regulate, and respond to. For someone with high emotional sensitivity, every social interaction becomes a kind of multi-threaded simulation, requiring simultaneous attention to verbal cues, body language, emotional undercurrents, and potential outcomes. That’s a huge cognitive burden.

Suppressing that burden isn’t callous. It’s adaptive.

2. Empathic Saturation
Similar to the clinical concept of compassion fatigue, empathic saturation occurs when a person is exposed to too much emotional data for too long, without sufficient psychological recovery. This is common among therapists, educators, medical professionals, and caregivers—but also among highly sensitive individuals in emotionally unpredictable environments.

Once saturated, the system protects itself—not by feeling less, but by numbing the receptors.

3. Preemptive Muting
Sometimes the detachment is anticipatory. A person senses that a particular environment (e.g., office politics, client meetings, high-stress deadlines) would become emotionally overwhelming if they allowed full empathic engagement. So the mind applies filters. These filters aren’t failures of sensitivity—they’re preemptive calibrations that allow the individual to function in emotionally dense environments.

Functional vs. Structural Detachment
A crucial distinction needs to be made here:

Functional Detachment

Structural Detachment

Developed as an adaptation

Inherent to personality or neurostructure

Rooted in emotional sensitivity

Rooted in emotional flatness or disinterest

Reversible or adjustable

Often fixed or biologically constrained

Common in trauma survivors, therapists, former idealists, and sensitive analysts

Common in narcissistic, sociopathic, or autistic profiles (in some cases)

You can think of functional detachment as an active firewall. It’s been built over time, and it often protects a system that is too sensitive, not too indifferent.

Where This Pattern Appears
This dynamic is more common than most people realize, especially in certain populations:

Therapists who burned out

Writers who turned engineers

Teachers who became executives

Empaths who became coders

Trauma survivors who became brilliant, distant thinkers

In all these cases, the individual once operated with open affective channels—but those channels flooded. And to survive, they closed them.

The Hidden Skill: Knowing When to Turn It Off
The healthiest form of this strategy is conscious modulation. It’s the ability to switch between high-empathy and low-empathy modes depending on context. This is especially vital for people whose work demands clarity, detachment, or cold problem-solving—but whose past (or temperament) pulls them toward emotional engagement.

To know when to feel fully and when to mute the signal is not a moral weakness. It’s a kind of meta-empathy:

empathy directed inward, toward the self, with the goal of long-term sustainability.
Final Thought
When someone seems emotionally detached, we tend to label them cold, distant, or indifferent. But in many cases, they are recovering from years of hyper-attunement. They have not stopped feeling—they have learned, often the hard way, when it becomes too much.

And so what looks like blindness is sometimes vision that’s been deliberately dimmed—not because it failed, but because it saw too much.

That kind of detachment is not the absence of feeling. It is a scar that forms after the senses have been overstimulated too many times.

It’s not coldness. It’s survival.

The Inability to Read Primal Emotion: What Star Trek Intuited and Psychology Later Confirmed
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 19
4 min read

There’s an old episode of Star Trek—technically the first episode ever made, the unaired 1965 pilot “The Cage”—that contains a surprisingly sharp psychological insight. In that episode, Captain Christopher Pike and his crew are abducted by a race of telepathic aliens called the Talosians. These beings can read thoughts, implant illusions, and construct entire mental realities. But at a pivotal moment, Pike realizes something: the Talosians can’t process violent, primal emotions. They can read thoughts, yes—but not that.

This plot point, which may seem like a convenient narrative twist, actually gestures at something profoundly true in the study of human psychology: there’s a crucial difference between reading thoughts and reading emotions, and the neural and experiential substrates underlying each are fundamentally distinct.

Thought and Emotion Are Processed in Different Parts of the Brain
From a neuroscientific standpoint, thoughts are typically cortical. They’re processed in the neocortex, particularly the prefrontal cortex—areas associated with language, planning, and abstraction. Thoughts are usually symbolic and can be represented in words, equations, or images.

Emotions, by contrast, are subcortical. They arise from older structures like the amygdala, hypothalamus, and brainstem. Emotions are preverbal, often body-based, and frequently resist tidy articulation. They manifest in tone of voice, muscle tension, pupil dilation, breathing rate—in the physiology more than the intellect.

So when we say someone is good at “reading people,” we usually mean they’re good at reading emotional states. But reading thoughts—as in deducing what someone is planning, thinking, or calculating—is a different skill entirely. The two overlap, but they’re not the same. And being skilled in one doesn’t guarantee skill in the other.

The Clinical World Reflects This Split
This thought/emotion distinction shows up frequently in psychology and psychiatry:

1. Autism and Hyper-Cognition
Many individuals on the autism spectrum—and indeed many “hyper-cognitive” neurotypicals—are excellent at recognizing patterns, decoding logic, and understanding systems. But they often struggle with affective empathy and somatic resonance. They can infer what someone is thinking, but not always what someone is feeling, especially when that feeling is subtle, raw, or unspoken.

2. Alexithymia
This is a condition in which a person has difficulty identifying and expressing emotions. They may feel emotions deeply, but cannot symbolize them. It’s a breakdown of the bridge between limbic affect and linguistic structure. It’s not unlike a Talosian mind unable to grasp the meaning of a human scream.

3. Trauma and the Body
In trauma therapy, it’s well known that the body “remembers” what the mind cannot. The most severe and primitive emotions—terror, rage, disgust—often get locked into the nervous system, bypassing the brain’s verbal processing centers. Survivors of abuse or violence may lack words for what they experienced, but their bodies react as if the trauma were still happening. In other words, their pain lives on a channel that’s inaccessible to logic, language, or “mental” telepathy.

The more one studies trauma, the more apparent it becomes that symbolic reasoning cannot penetrate primal affect—exactly as Star Trek suggested.

Why Fiction Got There First
There’s a reason Star Trek intuited this before the DSM did. Fiction—especially good speculative fiction—is a way of running psychological simulations. It tests hypotheses in narrative form. Writers like Gene Roddenberry weren’t just making up aliens with weird powers. They were externalizing facets of the human condition, creating stylized minds to explore cognitive and emotional asymmetries.

The Talosians, in this case, represent the extreme end of disembodied cognition. They’re all brain—no gut. Their intelligence is staggering, but their understanding of human motivation is profoundly limited. They can manipulate illusions, but they can’t fathom the blind fury of a cornered animal—or of a traumatized human being resisting control.

That blind spot, as it turns out, is not just an alien trait. It’s a human one too.

The Author’s Concern: A Personal Note
This insight wasn’t born from idle television-watching. It came from a real problem: being able to read thoughts, systems, and behavioral patterns with great precision—but feeling blocked when it comes to the emotional architecture of certain people, especially women.

The distinction is critical. Thoughts can be analyzed. Emotions often must be inhabited, felt, or embodied. And the emotional dynamics that drive many women—particularly the ones whose psychological structures are organized around intimacy, vulnerability, or performance—don’t yield easily to logical analysis. They are, like primal screams, illegible to disembodied cognition.

And just like the Talosians, people who live predominantly in the cognitive realm may find themselves stymied when confronted by raw affect. They may mistake emotional opacity for illogic, or interpret performative behavior as deception when it’s actually protective.

Final Thought
There’s a crucial asymmetry in human psychology: thought and emotion are not mirror images. The ability to navigate one does not imply mastery of the other. This is not a failure of intellect—it’s a feature of how the mind is built.

Star Trek understood this long before most clinical literature did. That shouldn’t surprise us. Fiction, after all, is how the mind speaks in metaphor before it knows the words.

Some minds, like Captain Pike’s, figure it out by living through it.

Others figure it out by writing about it.

Either way, it’s a truth worth sitting with: you can read someone’s mind and still be utterly lost inside their heart.

There Are No Laws—Only a Legal System
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 19

We grow up thinking laws are real things—fixed, objective rules that govern society. Break the rule, suffer the consequence. Simple.

But that's not how it works. What we actually have is a legal system. That system is real, powerful, and omnipresent. If you run afoul of it, it will disrupt your life: your finances, your freedom, your ability to function. So yes, there’s a system. But “laws,” as people imagine them—objective standards that are fairly and consistently applied—those don’t really exist.

Here's what I mean.

You can have airtight, exculpatory evidence. Everyone might even know it exonerates you—the judge, the prosecutor, your own attorney. But unless your lawyer introduces it in exactly the right way, using the right legal theory, at the right time, and unless he’s willing to burn political capital with the judge and the prosecutor (who he likely sees every day), that evidence might never see daylight.

Whether it gets used depends not on the “law,” but on:

Your lawyer’s intelligence

How hard he's willing to work

How much you're paying him

How emotionally invested he is in your case

Whether he's willing to rock the boat in a system built on relationships

And even if he introduces it flawlessly, the prosecutor can always object. The judge can always agree. And now the “law” becomes whatever the judge randomly decided in that moment. Your tape, your emails, your smoking gun—excluded.

So what do we really have?

We have a system: judges, lawyers, procedures, relationships, norms. That system matters. It's coercive. But the idea that “laws” exist as universal rules that mechanically produce outcomes—that’s mythology.

The law isn’t a code. It’s a chessboard. And your lawyer’s skill, your resources, and the personalities of the players determine whether you survive the game.

Zen Buddhism for Westerners Is the Opposite of What It Is for Easterners
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 18
2 min read

Introduction
Zen Buddhism means radically different things depending on where you’re from. For people in Japan, Korea, and other East Asian countries, Zen is about fitting in, following tradition, and dissolving the ego into the group. For Westerners—Americans, Europeans, and so on—Zen is usually about standing out, finding yourself, and breaking away from the crowd. The same practice, totally different functions.

Zen in the East: Collectivism and Obedience
In Japan and Korea, Zen is a centuries-old tradition. Becoming a monk or practicing Zen isn’t about being special. It’s about submitting to a strict routine, obeying authority, and blending into the group.

The whole point is to erase your personal desires and ego. You follow the rules, respect the hierarchy, and become part of something bigger than yourself.

This fits with the broader culture, where harmony, conformity, and respect for elders are core values. Zen is just one more way the society keeps itself stable and avoids conflict.

Zen in the West: Individualism and Rebellion
When Westerners get into Zen, it’s almost always about individualism. It’s a way to be different, to leave behind mainstream culture, or to search for “authenticity.”

Western Zen practitioners often see themselves as pioneers, rebels, or seekers. They want personal insight, self-actualization, or some kind of unique spiritual experience.

There’s no tradition in Western societies where becoming a Zen monk serves a social function. In fact, it can be seen as turning your back on your own culture.

The Myth of Satori (Enlightenment)
Zen promises “satori” or enlightenment—a sudden breakthrough or new horizon. For many, this is a carrot on a stick.

Critics (and many honest practitioners) point out that most people never reach this, and the pursuit can feel like a spiritual pyramid scheme: just keep meditating, keep reading, keep trying, and maybe you’ll get there.

In reality, a lot of Zen literature is vague, circular, or just deflationary. The “wisdom” often boils down to paradoxes or anti-climactic advice.

Evolutionary and Cultural Logic
In East Asia, Zen fits into the culture’s way of managing conflict and keeping people in line. It’s about group survival, not personal fulfillment.

For Westerners, there’s no cultural or evolutionary reason to become a Zen monk. It doesn’t solve any group problem; it’s a personal choice, often driven by dissatisfaction or alienation.

Bottom Line
Zen in the East: Maximal non-individualism. Obedience, conformity, erasing the self.

Zen in the West: Maximal individualism. Rebellion, self-discovery, standing out.

The same label—“Zen”—but almost the exact opposite meaning and function depending on where you’re from.

Conclusion
If you’re reading about Zen, know this: what it means in Japan or Korea is basically the opposite of what it means in America or Europe. Don’t buy the hype that it’s some universal path to wisdom. It’s a cultural tool, and it works differently—sometimes in completely contradictory ways—depending on the society using it.

The Actual Connection between Law and Philosophy (Spoiler Alert: It's Ugly)
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 19

It is frequently asserted that there exists a significant correlation between the disciplines of philosophy and law, as evidenced by the substantial number of philosophy graduates who pursue careers in the legal profession. However, this proposition is fraught with complexities. Upon engaging with legal studies, particularly in courses such as international law, one may discern an apparent absence of philosophical inquiry. The assumption that logic inherently underpins legal education is not entirely accurate; indeed, legal studies may exhibit less logical rigor than numerous other fields.


Upon closer examination, a rather disconcerting connection between philosophy and law emerges, reflecting negatively on both legal education and the institutionalization of philosophy. This linkage reveals that, within academic philosophy, the pursuit of truth is often secondary to strategic manipulation. Members of the philosophical community frequently focus on navigating procedural intricacies to gain advantage, whether for recognition or prestige, rather than engaging in genuine epistemic exploration.


Similarly, the study and practice of law are characterized by an emphasis on procedural adherence rather than truth-seeking. The legal system is distinguished by its focus on procedural compliance, a paradigm that does not necessarily equate to adherence to normative principles. This proceduralism, prevalent in both philosophical and legal contexts, is marked by an emphasis on strategic maneuvering over substantive truth discovery. Consequently, the connection between these two fields lies not in their shared commitment to logic or ethical norms, but rather in their mutual entrenchment in procedural manipulation.

The Soviet Union Gave American Proceduralism an Undeserved Sheen of Legitimacy

For decades, American patriotism was animated by what appeared to be a deep moral belief in freedom. But what if that belief was never about freedom per se? What if it was about contrast—about not being the Soviet Union?

During the Cold War, the United States defined itself against a truly ghastly regime: the USSR, with its gulags, its show trials, its secret police, its thought control. In that moral mirror, even the most mechanized and procedural aspects of the American system—electoral formality, bureaucratic structure, judicial process—shimmered with the aura of righteousness.

Proceduralism looked like moral clarity because it was framed against overt totalitarianism.
But once that adversary fell, once the Soviet Union dissolved and the Cold War frame dissolved with it, Americans were left to see their system in isolation. And what they saw was not freedom incarnate, but procedure without purpose.

The U.S. legal and political system had not been betrayed. It had not collapsed. It had simply revealed itself—a structure designed for scalability and stability, but with no affirmative moral vision at its center.

What was once interpreted as justice now looked like machinery.

The Cold War gave American proceduralism a borrowed halo—a glow it did not earn on its own.
And when that halo disappeared, so did the belief. Patriotism declined not because America had become something new, but because Americans began to see what it had been all along.

When Procedures Replace Purpose: How Modern Societies Lost Their Soul (And How to Get It Back)
John-Michael Kuczynski

 Imagine two societies:
Society A (Theocratic): Vengeance is holy if aligned with divine law.

Society B (Procedural): Vengeance is illegal, but wealth is sacred.

Both have rules, but only Society B claims neutrality. This illusion of neutrality is proceduralism’s fatal flaw: it replaces shared purpose with hollow compliance, reducing virtue to pencil-pushing and success to profit. Let’s dissect why—and how to escape this "iron cage."

1. The Virtue Vacuum
Proceduralism’s promise—neutrality through rules—masks a paradox:

Neutrality ≠ ValuelessnessBy refusing to endorse substantive virtues (piety, courage, artistry), proceduralism implicitly elevates market logic as the default metric of worth. Wealth becomes the ultimate virtue because it’s quantifiable, universal, and "fair."

“We drifted from having a market economy to being a market society.” —Michael Sandel4
The Spinelessness TrapWhen rules replace purpose:

Compliance becomes the only visible "virtue."

Wealth becomes the only scalable "success."

Meaning atrophies, leaving a void filled by burnout and alienation.

2. Weber’s Iron Cage Revisited
Max Weber foresaw this crisis. His "iron cage" of bureaucracy warned that rational systems, while efficient, would trap humanity in disenchanted, transactional existence61012.

Where Weber Nailed It

Procedural monoculture: Rules suppress alternate virtues (art, faith, community).

Market metastasis: Profit becomes proxy for purpose.

Where We’ve Outgrown HimWeber couldn’t foresee:

Algorithmic governance: Proceduralism now coded into apps and AI.

Globalized alienation: A workforce chasing metrics, not meaning.

3. Beyond the Pencil-Pusher Paradigm
How do we resurrect substantive virtue without coercion?

A. Pluralize Purpose

Localize meaning: Let communities define success (e.g., eco-stewardship in towns, artistry in cities).

Tax virtue: Incentivize caregiving, mentorship, or public service.

B. Hack the Bureaucracy

Subvert rules creatively: Use procedural compliance to fund radical kindness projects.

Reward dissent: Celebrate whistleblowers and ethical rebels.

C. Spartan Inspiration (Without the Spears)Imagine a society that values:

Valor over venture capital.

Civic duty over corporate loyalty.

Creativity over cubicle compliance.

This isn’t nostalgia—it’s a demand for multi-dimensional flourishing.

Conclusion: Write Your Own Rules
Proceduralism’s greatest lie is that neutrality is possible. But in refusing to debate what matters, we let market logic dominate by default. The escape? Reclaim purpose—personally and collectively—with the urgency of a heretic and the precision of a bureaucrat.

Your move, pencil-pushers.

What AI Means for the Future of Writing

The real question in front of us isn’t whether AI can write. It’s whether writing itself is about to become something fundamentally new—something that is still authored, still intelligent, but no longer solitary.

We already know two things:

AI, when used legitimately, scales real intelligence. It isn’t intelligence itself, but it captures, extends, and amplifies it.

The old humanist war is over. AI has won. Not because it replaced thought, but because it exposed how much of what we called thought—especially in academia—was formulaic, recycled, and dependent on rhetorical habit.

But this isn’t a story of loss. It’s a story of new capacity. And of the birth of a new artform.

The Rembrandt Hypothesis
If Rembrandt had access to Photoshop, would he have used it? Yes.

Would he have used it better than someone with no artistic talent? Also yes.

Would it have been the same art form as oil painting? Not quite. But it would have been a legitimate, creative extension of it.

That’s where we are with AI and writing.

The pen is no longer the point. The keyboard is no longer the bottleneck. The act of authorship is migrating from a linear solo performance to a recursive, dialogical, multi-intelligence interaction.

What Is This New Kind of Writing?
It is AI-integrated authorship: a co-generative, co-editing, co-questioning practice where human intelligence uses AI not to offload thought, but to extend, refine, and test it.

It is not prompt engineering. It is not gimmickry. It is not a shortcut.

It is a real-time epistemic feedback loop:

You produce insight.

AI reframes, stretches, reinterprets.

You sharpen your position in return.

And out of that loop comes something that neither mind could produce alone.

Core Properties of AI-Integrated Writing
Speed and Depth

You write a paragraph; AI mirrors it in four styles, three tonal variants, and two dialectical reversals.

Your thinking evolves faster.

Curation over Generation

The writer becomes a curator, a conductor.

The artistry lies not in starting from zero, but in knowing what to keep, what to cut, and what to challenge.

Iterative Precision

Arguments are no longer delivered once and for all.

They are stress-tested live, rewritten in minutes, and revisited with new evidence or analogies.

Interdisciplinary Reach

The AI brings in voices, texts, theories, analogies that would take weeks to research.

The writer integrates them in real time.

Transparency of Influence

Instead of hiding your sources, you now orchestrate them.

The writer becomes not a hoarder of originality, but a synthesizer of insight.

So Is It Still Writing?
Not in the old sense. Not in the sit-alone-with-a-blank-page sense.

But in the creative, critical, and meaning-making sense? Yes. Absolutely.

It is writing in the way jazz is music, in the way film is storytelling. It is what happens when the form bends to the tools, but the mind still leads the process.

You are not replaced. You are extended.

Final Thought
AI has ended the illusion of the isolated genius. It has ended the prestige of solo throughput.

But it has also opened the door to a new kind of writing—one where the author is still sovereign, but the canvas is wider, the brush is faster, and the feedback is immediate.

The future of writing will not be post-human.

It will be post-solo.

And in that future, your mind matters more than ever.

Review of a Book I have not Read: Christopher McMahon's Authority and Democracy: A General Theory of Government and Management 
John-Michael Kuczynski

By John-Michael Kuczynski

This is not a conventional book review. I have not read Christopher McMahon's Authority and Democracy: A General Theory of Government and Management (Oxford University Press, 2021). But I have read the abstract. And that’s enough to know what’s going on. 

Here is the abstract:

Should the democratic exercise of authority that we take for granted in the realm of government be extended to the managerial sphere? Exploring this question, Christopher McMahon develops a theory of government and management as two components of an integrated system of social authority that is essentially political in nature. He then considers where in this structure democratic decision making is appropriate. McMahon examines the main varieties of authority: the authority of experts, authority grounded in a promise to obey, and authority justified as facilitating mutually beneficial cooperation. He also discusses the phenomenon of managerial authority, the authority that guides nongovernmental organization, and argues that managerial authority is best regarded not as the authority of a principal over an agent, but rather as authority that facilitates mutually beneficial cooperation among employees with different moral aims. Viewed in this way, there is a presumption that managerial authority should be democratically exercised by employees.
The Old Proceduralist Move
McMahon’s abstract makes what is by now a familiar move: take the formal logic of democracy and apply it to another domain—in this case, the workplace.

The logic is:

Democracy is fair in government.

Management is a form of governance.

Therefore, management should be democratic.

It sounds reasonable. It even sounds moral. But it hides a crucial flaw—the same flaw that plagues all forms of proceduralist moral theory: it equates procedural fairness with moral legitimacy, while quietly evacuating the question of substance.

Governance Is Not Morality
In proceduralist thinking, legitimacy comes not from the content of decisions, but from the fairness of the process.

That’s the move Rawls made in political theory: design a fair procedure, and whatever it produces is presumed just.

McMahon extends this move to management: design a fair process of cooperation among employees with different moral aims, and whatever it produces is presumed legitimate.

But that ignores the basic fact that the workplace is not a morally neutral zone.

It is governed by capital, not consensus.

It is structured by ownership, not shared deliberation.

And the "cooperation" that takes place is often asymmetrical and enforced.

Calling managerial authority "democratic" just because it facilitates cooperation is like calling a corporate compliance training session a Socratic dialogue.

It’s not.

Cooperation Is Not Justice
There’s another deeper assumption here: that if a structure facilitates mutually beneficial cooperation, then it deserves to be called morally legitimate—even democratic.

But this is a functional criterion, not a moral one.

Mafias cooperate.

Cartels cooperate.

Colonizers and their local proxies cooperated.

That does not make the authority that coordinates them morally good. It makes it operationally effective.

So McMahon’s argument, as far as the abstract shows, is just another attempt to pull moral weight out of processual lightness. It smuggles legitimacy into systems that are structurally unequal by calling their mechanisms "cooperative" and therefore implicitly just.

But there is no account of what is actually being cooperated toward. No account of what counts as substantive good. Only aesthetic neutrality.

The Rhetorical Sleight-of-Hand
The idea that employees should exercise managerial authority democratically is a nice idea, in theory.

But in practice:

Most workers have no meaningful control over managerial decision-making.

The most important workplace decisions are made at levels far above employee deliberation.

And when "input" is gathered, it is almost always filtered, sterilized, and folded into decisions already made.

So what does it mean to say that managerial authority should be democratic?

In most real cases, it means nothing.
It is rhetorical cover for a system that retains its old structure while speaking the language of fairness.

Final Thought
Again, I have not read the full book. Maybe McMahon addresses these objections. Maybe he doesn’t.

But the abstract already gives away the game: it is an attempt to apply the moral prestige of democracy to the managerial sphere, using the same empty logic that Rawlsian proceduralism applied to politics.

It is an effort to derive substantive moral legitimacy from structural neutrality.

But neutrality is not virtue.

And cooperation, no matter how smoothly it runs, does not tell us whether a system is just.

It only tells us that it’s running.

And sometimes, that’s the problem.


In a Democracy, Virtue Is Bureaucracy
John-Michael Kuczynski

By John-Michael Kuczynski

In a democracy, what counts as virtue?

Not courage. Not toughness. Not principle. Not sacrifice. Not loyalty. Not defiance in the face of injustice. Certainly not violence on behalf of someone you love.

No. In a democracy, the only thing that is officially virtuous is compliance with procedure.

Virtue Equals Bureaucracy
This is not hyperbole. It is not satire. It is a fact.

In a procedural democracy:

A man who gets into a bar fight to defend his girlfriend is a criminal.

A man who discovers a horrible injustice and acts without waiting for proper approval is insubordinate.

A woman who refuses to comply with an unethical law is a threat to the system.

And in each case, their virtue—as understood in any traditional or moral sense—has no standing.

Meanwhile, the bureaucrat who follows every rule, meets every deadline, copies every supervisor on every email, and files every form is, procedurally speaking, flawless. Virtuous.

That is the official moral standard in a procedural democracy.

Compare With Traditional Societies
In a traditional society, virtue is tied to something: honor, piety, family, loyalty, courage, strength.

In a theocracy, virtue means living in accordance with God.

In a warrior culture, it means fighting well and dying with dignity.

In an aristocracy, it means bearing responsibility with integrity.

You can reject these systems. But they stand for something. And their idea of virtue is not reducible to procedural compliance.

In a democracy?

The only consistent, enforceable conception of virtue is being a rule-follower.
Everything Else Is Deviance
If you live with honor, intensity, or conviction, but outside the procedural lines, the system does not recognize you as morally serious. It treats you as a risk.

It does not ask what moved you. It asks:

Did you file the right paperwork?

Did you wait for approval?

Did you act according to policy?

If not, then you are legally and morally indistinct from a sociopath.

That is not a rhetorical flourish. That is the structural outcome of procedural morality.

What This Produces: Moral Weakness
Now, of course, people still have values. They still make judgments. But over time, living under a system that only respects bureaucratic compliance has a psychological effect.

People internalize the frame. They start to think that not making waves is the same thing as being good. That obedience is honor. That silence is maturity. That hesitation is wisdom.

And so, over time:

Virtue becomes timidity.

Passion becomes instability.

And strength becomes criminality.

Final Thought
In a democratic procedural system, the only thing that is not punishable is being a pencil-pusher.

All other moral traits must enter off the record. They are tolerated, not celebrated. Often, they are quietly destroyed.

And so the society becomes weak. Not just politically. Not just institutionally.

But morally.


Democratic Systems of Government Embody No Affirmative Morality
John-Michael Kuczynski

By John-Michael Kuczynski

Let’s suppose you have a theocracy. Whatever its merits or defects, that system of government embodies an affirmative conception of virtue. It may be wrong, even grotesque. But it stands for something. It has a substantive vision of the good.

Now contrast that with a pure democracy. Everyone votes. Everyone participates. But what does the system stand for?

Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

Democracy Is Procedural, Not Moral
A democratic system—as such—has no built-in conception of the good life. It says nothing about what kind of person is admirable, what kind of character should be cultivated, what kind of behavior should be rewarded.

It simply says:

"Let the majority decide."
That's it. That is not a moral framework. That is a mechanism.

It is procedural to the core. And therefore, spiritually vacuous.

People Have Affirmative Moralities, Even If the System Doesn’t
Of course, people within democratic societies have moral beliefs. Many have powerful conceptions of the good. John Stuart Mill certainly did. He believed deeply in the value of human development, liberty, intelligence, and self-cultivation.

But the political system he defended did not contain that moral content. It borrowed it from him.

This is the key point:

Democracy allows moral content to enter, but it does not produce it.
And that makes it fragile.

Meaningless Systems Are Weak Systems
A system of government that refuses to say what is good cannot defend itself when someone else arrives who can.

If a group with a strong, affirmatively moral worldview enters the scene, the procedural system has no defense. It can’t say:

You’re wrong.

You’re evil.

You threaten the foundation.

It can only say:

"Please vote fairly."
And that’s not enough.

Libertarianism as a Proxy for Meaning
In democratic cultures, you often find proxies for moral vision. Libertarianism is a good example:

It believes the government should be minimal.

It embeds a moral idea: that individuals possess inherent dignity and sovereignty.

So it imports meaning into a structure that otherwise refuses to provide it.

Even early republics (like the early U.S.) made moral judgments about who was capable of civic responsibility. That system may have been flawed, but it was not neutral. It had an ideal citizen in mind.

Today’s democracies do not.

The End of "Cut the Shit" Morality
Older systems could say:

"This person isn't serious. This person lacks virtue. This behavior is beneath a citizen."
Procedural democracies cannot say that.

They have no category for virtue. No standard for seriousness. No way to say: this is good and that is garbage.

All they can say is:

"Did the paperwork get filed correctly? Did the majority approve it?"
That is not governance. That is administration.

Final Thought
A system of government that embodies no affirmative morality is not neutral. It is morally vacated.

And in time, it will be filled by those who do believe something.

Democracy is not inherently evil. But it is inherently empty. And unless that emptiness is filled with genuine vision, it will collapse.

Not because it was defeated.

But because it had nothing to stand for.

Reviewing a Book I Haven’t Read (Because I Read the Abstract): Seana Shiffrin's "Democracy, Law, and the Empty Theology of Proceduralism"
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 16
3 min read

Updated: Apr 17

I haven’t read Seana Shiffrin's Democratic Law (Oxford University Press, 2021). But I have read the abstract. And that’s enough to know what kind of book it is—and what kind of intellectual ecosystem it lives in.

Here’s the publisher's summary:

The book defends the intimate connection between democracy and law by focusing on how democracy permits us to be co-authors of our common community through the use of law. It argues that democratically forged laws are articulate public commitments we make to one another and they are uniquely capable of conveying our mutual respect for one another. For this reason, democratic law is morally imperative and morally inspirational.
To which I say: I’ve seen this movie before.

And I know how it ends.

The Myth of Co-Authorship
Let’s start with this idea that democracy makes us "co-authors of our common community."

This is one of the most worn-out myths in proceduralist liberalism: that voting, or representation, or simply living under a procedural democracy makes you an author of the laws that govern you.

But what do we actually know, given only that a society is a democracy?

Do we know who controls capital?

Do we know who owns the media? Academia? Publishing?

Do we know whether ordinary citizens can meaningfully enter public life?

Do we know how racial, ethnic, or religious conflict plays out?

We know nothing.

"Democracy" is a purely formal descriptor. It tells you how the system claims to make decisions—not who actually makes them, or to what end.

And so the idea that democratic law is a form of mutual moral authorship is, at best, a poetic illusion. More often, it’s propaganda dressed as political theory.

The Empty Sacrament
The claim that democratic law is "morally imperative and morally inspirational" is, in essence, a prayer. Not a philosophical argument. A prayer to the god of procedural fairness:

"Because we followed the rules, we are good."
This kind of thinking is central to Rawlsianism and its orbit: the belief that justice is not a matter of truth, or virtue, or character, but of design. That if you create the right structure, and simulate consent, and enforce neutrality, the result is not just legitimate, but inspiring.

This is theology without transcendence. It is bureaucracy masquerading as morality.

And it is precisely the kind of intellectual emptiness that has drained modern democratic societies of vitality.

The Real Danger of Proceduralism
Let me be clear: procedure matters. Rules matter. Institutions matter. No one wants to live in a society ruled by whim.

But when procedure becomes the sole source of legitimacy, something horrifying happens:

Truth stops mattering.

Justice becomes secondary.

And the system becomes unassailable—because it worked exactly as designed.

This is how democracies produce:

Wrongful convictions.

Corrupt economic policy.

Institutionalized mediocrity.

And then call it all "just" because it was done through the proper channels.

A Review of the Genre, Not Just the Book
Again: I haven’t read the book. Maybe it has nuance. Maybe it’s better than its abstract.

But I’ve read the genre. I’ve read enough Rawlsian-lite proceduralist political theory to know what this is likely to be: an attempt to smuggle substantive moral legitimacy out of an empty formal structure. A kind of ideological prestidigitation.

The core move is always the same:

Define a procedure (democracy).

Declare that procedure inherently moral.

Announce that its products are therefore worthy of respect.

But democracy is not inherently moral. Procedures are not inherently just. Laws are not inherently expressive of mutual respect.

Sometimes they are. Often they aren’t. But that depends on what they say and what they do.

Not on how they got written.

Final Thought
Shiffrin’s abstract is not just a statement about law. It is a symptom of a culture that wants to believe that process is enough. That if we build a machine that looks fair, we can stop asking whether it is.

But machines cannot love. They cannot grieve. They cannot forgive. They cannot see the singularity of a human life.

Only people can do that.

And any legal or moral system that forgets this—whether dressed up in robes, or footnotes, or procedural theory—will, eventually, do what all blind machines do:

It will crush the very thing it claimed to protect.


Because if virtue means nothing more than obeying the system, then in time, there will be no one left who can stand up to it.


Rawslian Proceduralism as Civilizational Suicide
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 16
2 min read

By John-Michael Kuczynski

When Western civilization accepted proceduralism as its moral core, it signed its own death warrant.

Proceduralism is elegant. Scalable. Seemingly neutral. It ensures fairness in appearance and consistency in execution. But it is also dead inside. It does not tell people what to live for. It offers no conception of the good. No truth. No love. No beauty. Just fairness.

And that’s not enough.

The Ethical Castration of a Culture
A purely procedural morality neuters the soul. It teaches people not to seek greatness, but to stay within the lines. Not to pursue excellence, but to obey rules. Not to cultivate judgment, but to defer to form.

And when vitality disappears, so does the will to defend anything. Because you cannot fight for fairness. You cannot die for a well-processed form. You can only comply. And compliance does not produce civilization.

It merely maintains one. Until someone stronger walks in.

The Real Danger: Vitality Without Restraint
Proceduralism cannot compete with ideologies that still believe in something. It cannot face down those who are willing to destroy, to dominate, to transcend, or even to die.

Because proceduralism says:

"Don’t decide. Don’t discriminate. Just follow the structure."
And so, when someone shows up who says:

"I will decide. I will discriminate. I will win."
…the proceduralist folds. Not because he is weak, but because he has been morally disarmed by his own system.

What Rawls Gave Us
Rawls didn’t invent proceduralism, but he perfected its moral logic. He said: don’t pursue the good—pursue fairness. Design institutions that people would hypothetically agree to. Then run them. That’s justice.

But this is not justice. It is machine ethics.

It cannot inspire. It cannot lead. It cannot protect. It can only maintain.

Until something breaks.

And then it will have nothing to say.

Final Thought
Proceduralism works, for a time. It creates order. But it does so by draining a culture of the very forces that sustain it: belief, purpose, judgment, risk, moral vision.

Eventually, the society becomes so well-ordered that it forgets how to act. And when that day comes, those who still possess vitality will have their way with those who only possess process.

That is how civilizations die. Not in chaos.

But in perfect order, devoid of life.

Proceduralism is not merely inadequate. It is a form of civilizational suicide.


The New Meaning of "Developer"
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 16
2 min read

Until recently, the word developer meant one thing: someone who writes code to bring someone else’s idea to life. The developer was the technician, the translator, the builder-for-hire. The real vision—the spark—came from the so-called idea person. The developer made it real, often through long hours of dry, technical work.

But that’s changing.

Today, platforms like Replit, Bubble, Webflow, and a new generation of AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot) are quietly redefining what it means to be a developer. Increasingly, you don’t need to know how to code to build things. You just need to know what you want to build.

The result? The idea person—the person who used to need to hire a developer—is now the developer.

This isn’t just a shift in tools. It’s a shift in power.

From Implementation to Imagination
In the old world:

You had an idea.

You found a developer.

You hoped they didn’t flake, overcharge, or tell you it was “technically infeasible.”

In the new world:

You have an idea.

You open Replit.

You build it.

No more permission. No more translation. No more gatekeeping.

What used to take weeks of back-and-forth with a coder can now be prototyped in an afternoon. You don’t have to be fluent in JavaScript, or CSS, or Python. You just need to be fluent in what you want to make.

Not Just a Shift—A Redefinition
To be clear, this isn’t a widely accepted redefinition yet. In traditional circles—corporate org charts, job boards, tech conferences—a “developer” is still someone who writes code. Period.

But in practice, on the ground, the meaning is already mutating. The word “developer” is being stretched, broadened, democratized. Today, the term increasingly means: someone who builds things using whatever tools are available—including no-code, low-code, and AI.

And in a few years, it may mean only that.

What Happens Next?
Cultural tension. Traditional developers may scoff at this new breed of builders—just as photographers once scoffed at smartphones.

New language. We may start to see new terms emerge to distinguish between traditional coders and no-code/AI-native creators.

Status shift. As tooling replaces complexity, creativity becomes the new bottleneck. The developer of tomorrow may look less like an engineer and more like a screenwriter, entrepreneur, or philosopher.

Final Thought
The real revolution isn’t that code is getting easier.

It’s that ideas are getting legs—faster, cheaper, and without permission.

In this new world, the line between thinker and builder is vanishing. If you have the idea, and you can make it real—even with AI’s help—you’re the developer now.

When the Rules Are a Weapon: A Personal Story of Proceduralism at Work
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 16

By John-Michael Kuczynski

Years ago, as a student at a major university, I took an ethics course taught by a well-known professor. One of the assignments had a strict word limit. I exceeded it—not out of arrogance, not because I didn’t know the rules, but because I had something substantial to say. I forget the idea now, but at the time, it was real. It was serious.

I submitted the paper, expecting at worst a polite reprimand. Instead, I got an F.

Not because the work was wrong. In fact, the professor told me explicitly:

“You’re more intelligent than the other students, yes.”

“Yes, what you wrote exists in the literature.”

But none of that mattered. I had exceeded the word count. And therefore, the system had to respond.

I asked to revise. I admitted my error. I offered to resubmit within the limit.

She refused.

I tried to drop the course. She refused to sign the drop form. I had to go through the administration to get out. She tried to block that too.

This Was Not a Mistake. It Was the System Functioning Normally.
Later I learned that a senior professor in the department disliked me, though he had previously been supportive. She was, by all accounts, curry-favoring. But it wasn’t just personal.

It was procedural.
She had the form. She had the rule. She had the performance of neutrality.

And she had the moral satisfaction of punishing a deviation.

“It Wouldn’t Be Fair to the Other Students”
That’s what she told me when I asked to revise.

“It wouldn’t be fair to the others.”
This is the entire Rawlsian system in one sentence.

Not:

Would revising be right?

Would it reflect the quality of the work?

Would it support the student’s development?

Just:

“The structure must remain equal, even if that means rewarding mediocrity and punishing insight.”
When Insight Threatens the Frame
This wasn’t about fairness. It was about flattening. I had stepped outside the structure—not by cheating, but by exceeding it. And the system doesn’t know what to do with that.

So it punished me. Not despite the professor’s intelligence, but because of it. She knew what I was doing. That made it worse.

And so she invoked the rules.

Rules become weapons when they are used to suppress not wrongdoing, but deviation.
And proceduralism provides the perfect cover. It says:

“Don’t look at the outcome. Just check the boxes.”
Final Thought
The rules weren’t broken. The system wasn’t corrupted.

That’s the problem.

It all worked exactly as designed.

And that is why proceduralism, when left unchecked, doesn’t just fail the best among us.

It targets them.

And it does so with a smile.

Because after all, it wouldn’t be fair to the others.

When Innocence Doesn’t Count: The Case for an Evidentiary Override
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 16
2 min read

By John-Michael Kuczynski

In a strictly procedural legal system, innocence is not enough.

Let that sink in.

You can be factually, obviously, publicly innocent. Everyone in the courtroom can know it—the judge, the jury, the prosecutor, even the defense attorney. And yet, if the right piece of evidence isn’t introduced in the right way, under the right legal theory, by the right party, in the right time window, then the system simply shrugs.

Truth is not procedurally admissible unless it enters through the proper gate.
This isn’t a bug. It’s not an unfortunate edge case. It is a core feature of proceduralism as it exists in Anglo-American law.

And it is morally indefensible.

The Problem: Innocence Isn’t a Legal Category
In the proceduralist view, justice is defined by whether the system was followed. If the rules were observed, then the outcome is deemed just—even if the outcome is factually wrong.

In this framework, innocence is not legally actionable unless it gets plugged into the process correctly. There is no “Truth Override" button. No emergency brake. If the defense attorney forgets to introduce the videotape, or introduces it with the wrong label, or under an inadmissible theory, that’s it. The case is over.

The truth never got its procedural passport.

What We Need: An Evidentiary Override
Most discussions of override mechanisms focus on moral override: what to do when a procedurally correct outcome is ethically monstrous.

But we also need an evidentiary override: a way to let truth enter the courtroom directly, even when it didn’t follow the perfect route.

The evidentiary override is a formal recognition that:

Truth sometimes appears out of order

Procedure is not omniscient

Innocence, when clear and compelling, must not be overruled by a filing error

This is not about undermining structure. It’s about preserving the legitimacy of the system itself, which erodes every time a factually innocent person is punished for a procedural misstep.

This Doesn’t Even Help Commerce
The standard defense of proceduralism is that it makes law scalable and reliable—especially for commerce.

Fine. But what, exactly, is gained by imprisoning innocent people because their defense was filed 37 minutes too late? Does that stabilize markets? Build trust in institutions? Improve transactional clarity?

Of course not.

This isn’t rule of law. It’s bureaucratic nihilism masquerading as rigor.

Final Thought
A legal system that cannot recognize innocence unless it is procedurally perfect is not a system of justice. It is a machine.

And a machine that continues running even when it knows it is destroying the wrong person is not just flawed.

It is wicked.

We don’t just need moral discretion in the law. We need evidentiary sanity.

The override must be allowed to say:

“The truth is here. The form was broken.But we will not let that be the final word.”


Title: How to Build a Scalable Legal System With a Moral Override

How to Build a Scalable Legal System With a Moral Override

By John-Michael Kuczynski

It is one thing to say that procedural systems must include a moral override clause. It is another thing to ask: How?

Can we design a legal system that is:

Scalable

Predictable

Capable of handling commercial complexity

and also

Capable of recognizing when its own rules are leading to absurd or inhuman outcomes?

Yes. But it requires structural humility, architectural honesty, and the willingness to admit that no rulebook can see the future.

Why Scalability Matters
Let’s be clear: proceduralism exists because it works. It enables:

Contracts between strangers

Credit systems

Interoperable jurisdictions

Rule of law

Commerce demands neutral, reproducible, impersonal rules. You can’t scale a legal system on vibes or virtue alone.

So we are not saying: Abandon procedure.

We are saying: Temper it. Integrate conscience at the edge of the algorithm.

The Layered System: A Blueprint
Imagine a legal system with three concentric layers:

1. The Core: Procedural Law
Most disputes are handled here.

Rules are strict. Predictability is high.

Designed for scale, not nuance.

2. The Discretionary Margin: Institutionalized Equity
A specialized layer of courts or panels empowered to override outcomes in rare cases.

They do not nullify the law—they supplement it when it breaks down.

Criteria for access are narrow: moral absurdity, gross disproportionality, clearly unintended consequences.

3. The Reflective Perimeter: Systemic Review
Periodic auditing of decisions from Layer 2.

Transparency, case-based philosophy, integration of lessons back into Layer 1.

This prevents the override system from becoming arbitrary or politically captured.

Benefits
This system preserves:

The scalability of Anglo-American law

The moral intelligence of discretionary traditions

The institutional legitimacy that proceduralism alone cannot sustain

It allows for:

Commerce to thrive

Judges to be human

The law to learn

Why This Isn’t Judicial Usurpation
What we are proposing is not judicial activism or moral freelancing. It is:

The formal recognition that law without mercy is not law, but arithmetic.
By embedding the override within the system’s design, we make mercy a feature, not a glitch. We give justice a sanctioned space to breathe.

Final Thought
A legal system without a moral override is not fit for human beings. But a legal system without rules is not fit for scale.

The solution is neither chaos nor coldness. The solution is structure plus soul.

A system that knows when to say:

“This rule was well-crafted. But in this case, it’s wrong. And here is why.”

Why Every Procedural System Needs a Moral Override
John-Michael Kuczynski

By John-Michael Kuczynski

Procedures are essential. Rules, systems, protocols—they scale. They let us govern large populations, enforce contracts, process legal claims, and run economies. Without procedures, we get chaos, favoritism, or tyranny.

But here’s the problem:

A purely procedural system will always fail in the end.
Why? Because no rule set can account for every situation. Eventually, something happens that wasn’t anticipated. Something human. Something real.

And when that happens, a purely procedural system has only one option: follow the rule anyway.

That’s when proceduralism becomes monstrous.

The Manual Override Principle
Every scalable system of law or ethics must include what we might call the manual override clause:

A structural way to say: “Yes, that’s what the rule says, but come on. Let’s be human about this.”
Some legal systems make space for this explicitly. They allow for mitigating circumstances, sentencing breaks, or moral exemptions in extreme cases. The Anglo-American system, however, resists this. It exalts procedural purity.

And when judges grant mercy, they often do so unofficially. Quietly. Because the system, as written, offers them no authority to do it.

It has to be smuggled in.

Why This Matters
If a person kills their spouse’s murderer in a fit of grief and rage, do we really want a system that punishes them as if they were a cold-blooded serial killer?

Most people would say no. But a purely procedural system doesn’t ask what people would say. It asks what the rules say.

And the rules are silent on the fact that the person is a human being.

This is the deepest weakness of proceduralism:

It can be followed perfectly and still produce inhuman outcomes.
Which means that if we care about justice, we must build into our systems a way to step outside of them when necessary.

Can You Do That Without Chaos?
Yes. But it’s not easy. The challenge is to temper procedural systems without undermining their legitimacy. That requires:

Narrowly defined moral overrides

Clear thresholds for exception

Institutional humility

Because without that, all we have is:

Judges forced to break the rules to do what’s right

Or worse: judges forced to obey the rules and do what’s wrong

Neither is acceptable.

Final Thought
If a legal or ethical system cannot recognize when its own rules are leading to horror, then it is not a system of justice.

It is a machine.

And every machine, if left unchecked, will eventually do what machines do: follow its logic off a cliff.

The override clause is not a luxury. It is a necessity.

It is the last defense of the human against the procedural.



When Proceduralism Denies the Right to Exist
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 16
2 min read

By John-Michael Kuczynski

One of the more chilling consequences of Rawlsian proceduralism becomes visible when you follow it to its logical extreme—and that extreme has, in fact, been articulated by a prominent philosopher.

The claim? That people don’t have a right to exist.

The reasoning? Because they didn’t consent to their existence. They never signed the contract. They never agreed to the arrangement.

This idea is often presented in a highly theoretical context, usually under the banner of consent-based ethics. But once you understand what’s being said, the implication is obvious: under a fully proceduralist morality, even existence itself is ethically suspect unless it arises through a structure of prior rational agreement.

That sounds like a reductio. And it is. But it’s also, within the Rawlsian framework, perfectly consistent.

The Logic of the Veil
Rawlsian justice emerges from a thought experiment: rational agents, behind a "veil of ignorance" that hides their identities and advantages, design a fair society.

The idea is that fairness comes from procedural neutrality. No one knows where they'll land, so they'll choose rules that benefit everyone.

But what if you never had the chance to be behind the veil at all? What if you just appeared in the world, with no opportunity to consent to the structure of it?

Then, by Rawlsian lights, your presence isn’t just inconvenient—it’s illegitimate.

That’s the bridge to the claim: people have no right to exist. Not because they’ve done anything wrong, but because they didn’t get to agree to the procedure beforehand.

This is what happens when procedure becomes the sole criterion of legitimacy.

When the Premise Exposes the Rot
If Rawlsian proceduralism leads to the conclusion that existence itself is morally suspect, then something is wrong not just with the application, but with the foundation.

A moral theory that renders the human condition—being born, without consent—inherently unjustified isn’t just false. It’s anti-human.

Other moral theories may be flawed. But they rarely indict existence itself. They may impose duties, demand sacrifices, or envision impossible ideals. But they don’t suggest that your very being is a violation of principle.

Rawlsianism, taken seriously, does.

And that’s enough to disqualify it.

Final Thought
Ethical systems must be able to account for human reality. And human reality begins with unconsented existence. Any framework that sees that fact as a problem to be corrected—rather than a condition to be understood—is not a theory of justice.

It’s an operating manual for moral disintegration.


 Two Kinds of Disciplines—and the Birth of a Third
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 10

Across the history of human inquiry, disciplines have tended to fall into one of two categories, distinguished not by their subject matter but by their directionality: the kind of movement they enact between mind and world.

1. Disciplines That Go from Mind to Matter
These are the fields where cognition acts upon the non-cognitive world. They include:

Physics

Chemistry

Electrical Engineering

Mechanical Engineering

These disciplines involve projecting structure onto reality—building, modeling, predicting, and in some cases, controlling. Their foundational substrate is mathematics, which enables abstraction, formal modeling, and a kind of language-neutral precision.

In these fields, we use the mind to act upon the non-mind. We are not trying to understand minds or living systems per se, but to engage with physical systems—whether they are inanimate or animatable.

2. Disciplines That Go from Mind to Mind
These are fields where the object of inquiry is another mind—or at least a biological or social system with mental properties:

Psychology

Sociology

Anthropology

Economics (though this one has tried, somewhat artificially, to graft itself onto the physical sciences)

Here, the substrate is not math but philosophy—or rather, it should be. These fields involve interpretation, model-building, and normative analysis of minds, mental systems, and meaning-embedded behaviors. Philosophy serves as the conceptual substrate because it deals in the logic of concepts, values, cognition, and communication—none of which are easily mathematized, though many attempts have been made.

A Third Kind: Artificial Intelligence
With artificial intelligence, we witness the emergence of a hybrid discipline—one that is not merely interdisciplinary but structurally inter-genus. AI fuses the projective orientation of the mind-to-matter fields with the interpretive reflexivity of the mind-to-mind fields.

Why?

Because AI is not just a tool; it is a cognitive artifact. When we build a bridge, we are engineering a structure that remains inert and non-representational. It performs a physical function. But when we build an AI, we are building something that models, learns, and in some cases, begins to exhibit properties of cognition.

Reverse-Brain Engineering
The proper name for this new genre of activity might be reverse-brain engineering: the systematic construction of artificial cognitive systems in order to understand, replicate, and eventually refine the architecture of natural cognition.

The project is neither pure engineering nor pure analysis. It is projective interpretation—the act of modeling a mind in such a way that one’s own mind is necessarily brought into the model. One learns about mind by trying to build one. In doing so, the boundary between epistemology (how we know) and engineering (how we build) collapses.

This is not the case with traditional computing. Computers, in the classical sense, are not minds and make no claim to be. They are deterministic processors of syntactic instructions. AI, however—especially in its contemporary large-model instantiations—operates probabilistically, contextually, and at times interpretively. It mimics mind not only in structure but in function.

The Failure of Economics (and the Philosophy Behind AI)
Economics sits uncomfortably at the boundary. It aspires to be in the first category—crisp, quantitative, law-like—but its true nature is in the second: it deals with beliefs, expectations, utility, strategy, trust—all of which are fundamentally cognitive phenomena.

Attempts to ground economics in mathematics (especially post-1940s formalism) have produced technical sophistication at the expense of conceptual clarity. This is because the true substrate of economics is philosophy—not math. The rational agent is not a computational node but a conceptual persona. And AI, when built properly, is not a calculator—it is a theorist, a strategist, a modeler.

Which is why the development of AI should not be the province of engineers alone. It should involve philosophers, cognitive scientists, linguists, and psychologists—because AI is not just an artifact; it is a theory instantiated in silicon.

A Telescoping Discipline
AI is not a telescope pointed outward at the stars. It is a telescope that looks back—at us. In trying to build it, we are building a model of the very thing doing the building. This recursive character is what makes AI the defining intellectual project of our era. It is not a bridge; it is a mirror.

A mirror, and a kind of third kind.

The Real Divide in Science: Entropy vs. Counter-Entropy
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 10
3 min read


In academic discourse, it's common to divide the sciences into two camps: the mental and the physical. Psychology, economics, and sociology go in the first; physics, chemistry, and geology in the second. This split is not meaningless—it reflects real differences in subject matter. But it is ultimately superficial.

The more fundamental division is not between mind and matter, but between entropic and counter-entropic systems.

Entropic vs. Counter-Entropic
The term entropy refers, in thermodynamic terms, to the measure of disorder in a system. Over time, closed physical systems tend toward states of higher entropy—greater uniformity, randomness, and energy dispersion. This is the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and it is perhaps the most universal law in all of science.

In this light, we can classify scientific disciplines based on the directional flow of entropy in the systems they study:

1. Entropic Sciences
These study systems that degrade over time, systems that flow naturally toward disorder:

Physics

Classical Chemistry

Astronomy

Geology

Their aim is to model the dissipation of energy, the loss of structure, the convergence toward equilibrium. They are predictive in the sense that they describe how systems fall apart—or more neutrally, how they evolve under minimal internal constraints.

2. Counter-Entropic Sciences
These study systems that resist entropy locally by building, maintaining, or reproducing structure:

Biology

Neuroscience

Psychology

Cognitive Science

Information Theory

Evolutionary Theory

Counter-entropic systems are anomalies in the thermodynamic field. They capture energy, use it to build order, and often do so adaptively. Most importantly, they don’t just resist entropy—they exploit it to maintain internal complexity. Life itself is the central example.

Minds as High-Order Counter-Entropy
Minds—at least as we know them—are biologically instantiated systems that reverse entropy with exceptional efficiency. They store information, make predictions, preserve memories, and engineer further counter-entropy: buildings, cities, languages, mathematics, philosophy.

From this perspective, the mind is not a metaphysical mystery; it is a thermodynamic marvel. It is the most structured counter-entropic system we know of, and the sciences that study it—psychology, linguistics, anthropology—are not “soft” in any pejorative sense. They are simply trying to model systems that are:

Self-referential

Adaptive

Representation-rich

Temporally non-linear

This makes them more complex than the physical sciences—not less scientific.

Economics and the Misplaced Quest for Entropy
Economics is a revealing case. It deals with expectations, preferences, beliefs, and strategy—clearly the domain of counter-entropic systems. Yet it has long attempted to align itself with physics, using mathematics to emulate law-like precision. The result is often impressive in form but brittle in content. The models work—until they don’t.

Why? Because they are modeling minds and collectives of minds, not falling bodies or orbiting planets.

Artificial Intelligence: Where Entropy Meets Its Match
The development of AI collapses this dichotomy. It is a third kind of discipline—one that builds counter-entropy. Classical computers are entropic in function: deterministic, rule-bound, non-adaptive in their core behavior. But AI—especially neural networks, reinforcement learning, and large language models—are designed to self-organize, self-correct, and self-model.

In short, they are engineered counter-entropic systems. And in building them, we are:

Modeling natural counter-entropy (minds, brains, evolution), and

Creating artificial systems that push back against entropy in novel, non-biological ways.

This is not merely engineering. It is a new form of science—reverse-brain engineering—where we learn about mind, structure, and cognition by trying to build them from scratch.

Why This Matters
By shifting the axis from mental vs. physical to entropic vs. counter-entropic, we gain:

A more fundamental understanding of what scientific disciplines are actually doing

A way to clarify the true object of inquiry (is it a system that collapses over time or one that resists collapse?)

A better sense of which conceptual tools are appropriate (e.g., math vs. philosophy, optimization vs. interpretation)

A clearer view of AI’s unique position as a domain that builds counter-entropy from within the entropic substrate of computation

Final Thought
The traditional divisions of science are mostly political: “hard” vs. “soft,” “STEM” vs. “humanities,” “quantitative” vs. “qualitative.” But if we take thermodynamics seriously, the deeper division is energetic, structural, and directional.

Entropy flows downhill. Life pushes back. Minds climb. AI might, for the first time, engineer the climb itself.

𝜉 and the Fundamental Drift: Why Large-Cap Prices Have Broken from Economic Reality
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 15
4 min read

by John-Michael Kuczynski 


In classical finance theory, prices are thought to reflect fundamentals. Stocks represent ownership claims on real economic activity—on revenue, profits, capital structure, and future cash flows. Valuation, in that framework, is not guesswork; it is the quantitative distillation of corporate performance. But this assumption, though repeated in textbooks and market commentary, is rarely tested directly.

I decided to test it.

To measure the actual degree to which a company’s price behavior tracks its fundamental metrics, I built an application that continuously compares time-series data on fundamentals (e.g., earnings, revenue, margin, debt ratios) with contemporaneous price action. To formalize this comparison, I introduced a proprietary metric, which I call 𝜉 (xi):

𝜉 is the statistical degree to which changes in price are correlated with changes in a company’s fundamentals.
The empirical results are not ambiguous. For large-cap equities—particularly those that dominate the S&P 500 and global indices—𝜉 is effectively zero.

The Collapse of Price-Fundamental Alignment
What does it mean for 𝜉 to be zero? It means that a company’s stock price can rise or fall independently of any measurable change in its core economic reality. It means that even large, sustained improvements in revenue, margin, or earnings per share often have no reliable effect on the firm’s market valuation. And conversely, prices may fluctuate wildly in the absence of any underlying change in the company's condition.

This decoupling of price from value implies a profound epistemic failure. If stock prices do not reflect what companies are, then what do they reflect? One answer—discussed elsewhere—is that in the case of large-cap stocks, prices increasingly reflect order book dynamics, short-term momentum patterns, and the microstructure behaviors of algorithmic traders, rather than any enduring economic substance. Fundamental information, even if available, becomes lagging, background noise in a market dominated by speed, flow, and liquidity arbitrage.

Do Smaller Companies Exhibit Higher 𝜉?
Given this decoupling at the top of the market, the natural follow-up question is whether smaller and mid-sized firms exhibit a higher 𝜉 value—i.e., whether they maintain a stronger correlation between their economic reality and their market price.

Empirical evidence suggests that the answer is yes, but only modestly.

Numerous studies in asset pricing have found that fundamental metrics—such as P/E ratios, profit margins, and earnings growth—have greater predictive power for future returns in small- and mid-cap equities than in large caps. While these correlations are rarely strong in an absolute sense, they are statistically significant and nontrivial, often in the 0.2 to 0.4 range. That is, while large caps exhibit a near-total disconnection (𝜉 ≈ 0), smaller firms display a measurable, though still noisy, sensitivity to fundamentals.

Why Might This Be?
There are several plausible reasons why 𝜉 would be higher in small and mid-cap firms:

Reduced algorithmic saturationLarge-cap equities are prime targets for high-frequency and quant-based trading strategies that focus on technical and flow-based indicators rather than fundamentals. Smaller firms, by contrast, often lack the liquidity required for such strategies and thus may be less distorted by non-fundamental trading.

Greater transparency of fundamentalsIn mid-sized firms—particularly those in industrials, regional banking, or materials—the firm’s financial statements may provide more direct insight into operational performance, with fewer layers of abstraction or speculative narrative.

Lower narrative interferenceLarge companies are disproportionately affected by macro narratives, geopolitical sentiment, and “brand momentum.” Mid-cap firms may fly under the radar and thus allow real performance to move the needle.

Analyst neglect paradoxBecause fewer institutions track or model small and mid-cap firms, the price may more readily respond to real shifts in fundamentals, which are not already fully digested by consensus models.

However, there are limits to this effect:

Small caps are often highly volatile for reasons unrelated to fundamentals—especially in sectors like biotech, clean energy, or junior mining.

Many small companies are pre-revenue, or have economic models that are not yet stable or measurable in conventional accounting terms.

And even in mid-cap territory, speculation, liquidity effects, and hype cycles can distort prices well beyond what fundamentals would justify.

A Tentative Landscape of 𝜉
Market Segment

𝜉 Value

Notes

Large-cap

≈ 0

Price driven by liquidity, flows, algos, and macro narrative

Mid-cap

~0.2–0.4

Fundamentals have modest influence, especially in stable sectors

Small-cap

~0.1–0.3

Mixed: some correlation, but often drowned in speculative noise

Thus, while 𝜉 is higher outside the large-cap domain, it is not high in absolute terms. The partial alignment between price and fundamentals that exists in the mid-cap world should not be romanticized. It merely appears more coherent in contrast to the large-cap segment, which has become epistemically adrift.

The Deeper Implication
That 𝜉 is low across the board—especially in the most visible, liquid, and analyzed corners of the market—has far-reaching implications. It casts doubt not just on the EMH, but on the broader ideology of valuation-based investing. If the price of an asset does not track its economic value, then what is being priced? And how can rational capital allocation be claimed?

The answer, increasingly, is that price reflects second-order beliefs: beliefs about what others believe, rather than about what is true. This reflexivity feeds a feedback loop in which narrative and structure supplant content.

In that context, the act of measuring 𝜉 becomes not just a statistical exercise, but a philosophical act—a way of interrogating whether markets still serve their stated function: to reflect, and allocate according to, real value.


“Priced In”: The Circular Faith of the Efficient Market Hypothesis
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 15
3 min read

The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is one of those ideas that sounds powerful and scientific—until you try to pin down what it's actually saying.

At its core, EMH claims that asset prices always reflect all available information. No one can consistently “beat the market,” because whatever you know, the market already knows. Seems tidy enough. But tug at it a little, and something slippery starts to emerge.

🧠 “Priced In”: The Floating Signifier
Central to EMH is the idea that information is always “priced in.” But what does that mean?

If new information emerges—say, a company announces a breakthrough or a scandal—the market responds. If the stock price moves, we say: “Ah, the market has priced it in.” But here’s the catch: if the price doesn’t move, we might also say: “Well, the market had already priced it in.”

Either way, the theory wins. It explains everything—and therefore, nothing.

This isn’t just a rhetorical flaw; it’s a logical one. “Pricing in” becomes a kind of tautology:

If it affected the price, it was information.If it didn’t, it wasn’t—or was already accounted for.
That makes EMH immune to contradiction, but also immune to usefulness.

🔁 The Circular Trap: Information Is What Moves Prices
Here’s where the muddle deepens.

Under semi-strong and strong forms of EMH, “information” is not limited to company fundamentals or macroeconomic data. It includes:

Investor sentiment

Rumors

Trends

Tweets

Collective mood

This leads to a strange inversion of causality:

Instead of saying “information drives prices,”the theory often acts as if “whatever drives prices is, by definition, information.”
That collapses the distinction between signal and noise.

If a stock soars because of a viral TikTok meme, EMH says: That meme must’ve been information.If a CEO stumbles over their words on an earnings call and the market panics, EMH says: The stumble was meaningful.If a mass hallucination occurs, the theory doesn’t blink—it calls it priced in.

🪞 But What Is the “Right” Price?
This problem is especially glaring when we compare stocks to goods with intrinsic utility—say, wheat or copper. Those commodities are anchored in physical necessity. A “wrong” price causes actual scarcity or surplus.

But a stock? A stock is a claim on an imagined future. It has no intrinsic “use,” only expectations.

In that way, stocks are more like luxury goods than commodities. Their price depends on mood, narrative, and belief. And EMH tries to call all of that “information”—no matter how whimsical, irrational, or fleeting.

That might make EMH descriptive in a loose, sociological way. But it robs the theory of its normative or predictive power. It doesn’t help us distinguish market wisdom from market madness. It just re-labels both as “efficient.”

🧨 So What’s Left?
Ironically, EMH ends up being a theology of price—not a theory of value.

It invites you to trust the market because everything is priced in, and everything that’s priced in is valid. In doing so, it confuses:

Knowledge with movement

Rationality with reaction

Truth with trend

And it turns “pricing in” from a useful heuristic into a circular article of faith.

Final Thought
If we want to understand markets—not just model them—we have to do better than this. We have to recover the distinction between signal and noise, between insight and inertia, and between value and fashion.

Until then, we’re just watching prices go up and down, telling ourselves it’s all information.

Why Star Wars Is Jungian

Myth, Archetype, and the Shadow in a Galaxy Far, Far Away

Star Wars (1977) is not just a space opera—it’s a Jungian dreamscape. Every frame of George Lucas’s original film is steeped in archetype, guided by mythic structure, and powered by the psychological machinery Carl Jung spent a lifetime mapping. It isn’t about space. It’s about soul.

Lucas has openly credited Joseph Campbell’s The Hero with a Thousand Faces as a guiding influence—but Campbell was really just Jung, with a passport and a storytelling manual. So when we say Star Wars is Jungian, we’re not being metaphorical. We’re being diagnostic.

The Hero’s Journey = Individuation
Jung believed the psyche seeks wholeness, a process he called individuation—the integration of all aspects of the self: conscious, unconscious, shadow, anima/animus, and so on. The hero’s journey isn’t a story template—it’s a map of that internal transformation.

Luke Skywalker’s arc in A New Hope is pure individuation:

He starts in ignorance and naïveté (undeveloped consciousness).

He receives a call to adventure (awakening of the deeper self).

He meets guides (Ben Kenobi), faces trials (loss, danger), and begins to awaken to his own inner power (the Force).

And, crucially, he begins to confront the Shadow.

Darth Vader = The Shadow
In Jungian terms, the Shadow is the part of the self that has been denied, repressed, or projected outward. It is powerful, dangerous, and essential. It isn’t “evil” per se—it’s the unintegrated dark.

Vader isn’t just the villain—he is the unclaimed part of Luke.Even in 1977, before their family bond was revealed, Vader’s entire function was symbolic: he is masked, cloaked, unknowable. He represents what Luke could become if he gives in to power without balance.

The ultimate arc of the series is Luke confronting and refusing to destroy the Shadow—instead, reaching out to redeem it. That’s Jung.

The Force = The Collective Unconscious
The Force isn’t a religious system. It’s a Jungian metaphor:

Impersonal

Morally ambiguous

Accessible through intuition

Binding everything in a way that transcends language

It’s not God. It’s not science. It’s the deep substrate of shared symbolic life.The Jedi tap into it the way the mystic or the shaman taps into the collective unconscious. When Kenobi says, “Trust your feelings,” he’s issuing a Jungian directive.

Ben Kenobi = The Wise Old Man Archetype
This one’s by the book. Jung identified the “Wise Old Man” as a classic archetype: the elder who initiates the ego into the larger psyche.

Kenobi guides Luke into the Force, introduces him to the truth of his family, helps him leave the false father (the Empire), and calls him toward integration.

He is Merlin, Gandalf, Tiresias, and the alchemical guide rolled into one.

Leia = The Anima (In Early Form)
Leia, in the 1977 film, serves as an early anima projection for Luke—a figure of courage, purity, and mystery. She’s not yet individuated herself (or even fully humanized—remember, this was still pulp), but she functions psychologically as:

The bridge between the ego and the feeling function—Luke’s reason to care, to fight, to reach beyond himself.
Later, this function will shift and evolve—but in A New Hope, she’s a classic spark of inner balance.

The Death Star = The Cave
Jung saw the descent into the cave as a recurring archetype of confrontation with the unconscious. The Death Star is literally a dark, labyrinthine structure—technocratic, sterile, a symbol of mechanized control. It’s also where Luke first truly faces death, loss, and fear.

It is the belly of the whale—the darkest part of the journey, where the self is stripped down and reborn.

Conclusion
Where Star Trek is Freudian—managing impulses, integrating rationality and emotion within the civic ego—Star Wars is Jungian: mythic, symbolic, inner-world oriented. It isn’t about managing the psyche. It’s about confronting, integrating, and transcending it.

Luke doesn’t just grow up.

He integrates—the Shadow, the Anima, the Self, the Force.
And that’s why Star Wars feels more like a dream than a drama. Because it is—a dream forged from the architecture of the collective unconscious.

Why Star Trek Is Freudian

Kirk, Spock, McCoy—and the Structure of the Psyche in Space

Star Trek: The Original Series wasn’t just a sci-fi adventure. It was a psychological diagram with phasers. Week after week, it staged conflicts that weren’t just political or philosophical—they were intrapersonal. And the reason the show felt so balanced, so rich, so durable is simple:

It was Freudian. All the way down.
Freud’s Three-Part Mind
Freud divided the human psyche into three interacting forces:

The Id: primal desires, emotion, instinct, libido.

The Ego: the rational mediator, caught between impulse and restraint.

The Superego: internalized authority, morality, discipline, logic.

Freud also mapped three libidinal character types:

The narcissist (the doer, craver of glory),

The obsessional (the thinker, self-contained, withdrawn),

The libidinal (the lover, the feeler, the emotional connector).

And wouldn’t you know—it maps exactly onto Star Trek’s central triad.

Kirk: The Narcissist / The Ego
Captain Kirk is the ego in action—brash, confident, improvisational. He makes decisions, takes responsibility, lives in the moment. He is the “I” who weighs competing claims and steps forward. He’s also the narcissist, in the Freudian sense—not pathologically vain, but oriented toward action, visibility, and impact. He’s the archetypal doer.

He listens to Spock, but doesn’t submit to logic.

He feels with McCoy, but doesn’t drown in sentiment.

He navigates both, and carries the burden of command.

Kirk is the Freudian mediator—the one who must integrate, synthesize, act.

Spock: The Obsessional / The Superego
Spock is the superego, pure and simple. Reason. Logic. Restraint. But not because he’s cold—because he’s defending himself from his human half. He’s an obsessional character in the psychoanalytic sense: intellectual, self-disciplined, repressed. Everything gets filtered through principle.

He suppresses emotion with surgical precision.

He aspires to a kind of purity that often alienates him.

He is not at war with others—he is at war with himself.

Spock is the embodiment of Freud’s observation that the superego is the harshest judge—especially of the self.

McCoy: The Libidinal / The Id
Dr. McCoy is not a primitive brute. But he is the voice of passion, outrage, care, and the body. He’s emotional. He drinks. He snaps. He loves. He mourns. He feels. In Freudian terms, he’s the libidinal type—and in structural terms, he’s the Id: he expresses the energy, anger, and yearning that the others (especially Spock) suppress.

He argues with Spock, not because he’s irrational, but because he insists on human stakes.

He doesn’t give orders—he gives a damn.

He’s the conscience of the show, in a raw and bodily register.

He is emotion made articulate.

Why This Structure Matters
The brilliance of Star Trek isn’t just its stories—it’s its psychological symmetry.

The Id (McCoy) pushes for passion.

The Superego (Spock) demands restraint.

The Ego (Kirk) must choose, balance, synthesize, act.

Each episode is a microcosm of the self in conflict. That’s why the show feels more intimate than its galactic scale would suggest. The real frontier isn’t outer space—it’s the psyche, and Star Trek mapped it in Freudian terms.

Conclusion
Star Trek succeeds not because of its special effects or space diplomacy, but because of its psychological architecture. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy aren’t just characters—they’re facets of all of us.

The show endures because it’s not just about boldly going “out there.”It’s about making peace in here.

Hollowness as Code for Status Anxiety

On Snobbery, Class Signaling, and Why the Truly Busy Don’t Lament “Our Times”

There’s a whole genre of cultural criticism—some literary, some academic, some just smug—that mourns the so-called hollowness of modern life.

You know the type:

T.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land

Sartre’s Nausea

Camus’ entire vibe

Every young intellectual who bemoans “late capitalism” while sipping ethically sourced espresso

And the tenured essayist who wistfully mourns the loss of deep meaning in the digital age

Their message, in essence: We have lost something. Our times are hollow. We used to have depth—now we have TikTok.

But here’s the question they never answer:What exactly did we lose?

What Did People in 1512 Have That We Don’t?
These writers never get concrete. What are we missing?

Is it the church?

The monarchy?

The guild system?

Literacy rates under 10%?

Was life really fuller when plagues wiped out cities, children died before age five, and your choices in life were “till the field” or “join the clergy”?

It’s never specified. Because the point isn’t to be accurate—it’s to signal seriousness. And more importantly, status.

Hollowness as Code for Status Anxiety
Let’s name what’s really going on:

When writers lament “the hollowness of our times,” they’re not describing a historical condition. They’re describing their own status anxiety.
They don’t feel securely respected in a plural, chaotic, decentralized age.They feel displaced by mass culture, by new money, by technology, by change.

So they take refuge in elegy. They mourn what’s been “lost”—not because it’s better, but because they knew where they stood in that world.

It’s a way to broadcast allegiance to a cultural aristocracy that no longer exists.It’s a job interview disguised as a diagnosis.

Snobbery is for the Half-Safe
Here’s the personal version.

I used to be in academia. I had a place, a rank, a certain degree of social insulation. And then—very suddenly, very brutally—that was yanked from me. I had to earn my living from scratch. No prestige. No network. Just output and consequence.

And you know what happened?

Whatever snobbery I had just vanished.
Because when you’re building something—when you’re actually fighting for your life—you don’t have the bandwidth for class-posturing. You may judge people. You may dislike them. But snobbery—the performance of taste to curry favor upward—that’s gone.

Which leads us to the real profile of the snob:

Snobbery is something junior people do to impress senior people.It is the culture of “please like me” disguised as “I am above you.”
The Henry Ford Principle
Here’s the test:

Was Henry Ford a snob?

Is Jeff Bezos a snob?

Is Elon Musk a snob?

They might be egomaniacs. They might be assholes. But they’re not snobs. Because they’re not trying to impress anyone. They don’t need to signal cultural allegiance to survive.

Snobbery dies when self-reliance begins.
Let’s call this the Henry Ford Principle:

The more responsibility you carry, the less room you have for snobbery.
Conclusion
So the next time you read another thinkpiece or poem about “the hollowness of modern life,” ask yourself:

Is this about history?

Is it about values?

Or is it about someone trying to secure their place in a shifting cultural order?

Because odds are, that “hollowness” they see in the world is really just the echo of their own fading status.

Satire Without Systems: What Sinclair Lewis (and Hawkeye from MASH Types) Don’t Understand
John-Michael Kuczynski

There’s a kind of literary pose that never goes out of style: the smug, knowing intellectual skewering the hapless, bourgeois square. Think Hawkeye Pierce ridiculing Frank Burns. Think Sinclair Lewis sneering at Babbitt. Think any smart kid in the back of the class chuckling at the teacher’s necktie.

But here’s the thing: the satire falls apart if you don’t understand the system you’re mocking.

The Blind Spot of the Smart Set
Writers like Lewis often portray middle-class work as inherently absurd: real estate deals, boosterism, commerce, insurance, mortgage brokering. It’s all portrayed as shallow theater.

But none of it could exist without:

Capital flows

Risk underwriting

Legal frameworks

Infrastructure coordination

And actual knowledge of how economies work

And these writers often don’t have that knowledge. Which is fine—until they start scoffing at the people who do.

The Babbitt Problem
Babbitt is a windbag. Sure. He talks too much, tries too hard, craves approval.But he also occupies a place in the real machinery of civilization.

He helps allocate space.

He facilitates growth.

He’s a node in a network of economic translation.

Lewis doesn’t see that—because he never bothers to. To him, Babbitt is a type, not a participant. A clown, not a component.

Which is why the satire rings hollow: you can’t mock what you don’t understand.

The Frank Burns Problem
Hawkeye Pierce, smart and morally self-assured, is clearly the hero. But watch closely: Frank Burns may be cowardly, conservative, and self-important—but he follows procedure. He keeps the system running. And for all his faults, he works.

Hawkeye mocks the machinery. But it’s the machinery that makes surgery possible.

Satire Without Respect = Superficiality
If you don’t understand:

How housing markets work,

What banks actually do,

Or what a zoning board even is,

…you’re not writing critique. You’re just doing stand-up.

That’s what a lot of highbrow literary mockery boils down to:

Laughter from people who’ve never had to fix the plumbing.
Conclusion
There’s plenty to criticize in the middle class, in commerce, in bureaucracy. But if you want your satire to bite, you need to know what you’re biting into.

Otherwise, you’re not satirizing a system.You’re just mocking a guy for wearing a tie and showing up to work.


Freud vs. America: Misunderstood, Misjudged, and Materially Misconceived

What Freud Said
Freud once remarked, in the early 20th century:

“What the Americans are doing is very bold and admirable, but it is, I am afraid, doomed to fail.”
It’s a haunting phrase—admiring on the surface, but deeply condescending underneath. And it echoes the sentiment of many European intellectuals of the time: America was vibrant, yes, but spiritually hollow. Too cheerful. Too fast. Too commercial.

But what did Freud actually mean by “fail”? And did he get it right?

What He Meant
Freud didn’t mean America would collapse politically. He meant that its project—to build civilization without brooding introspection, without engagement with the unconscious—was psychically unsustainable.

In his view:

Americans denied inner conflict.

They ignored repression and sublimation.

They worshipped efficiency, productivity, and optimism—at the cost of soul-depth.

To Freud, this looked heroic but naive. Like a machine running without oil. Sooner or later, it would seize up.

What He Missed
But here’s where Freud—brilliant, prophetic Freud—failed:He treated American vitality as a mask for decay, rather than as a different mode of health.And worse: he had no serious understanding of how economies work.

To him, all that boldness—skyscrapers, railroads, advertising, jazz, scale—looked spiritually thin.But he couldn’t see that what he called “hollowness” was in fact mass coordination, energy management, risk absorption, and institutional complexity at an unprecedented scale.

Freud saw middle America as shallow. But he had never laid bricks, sold houses, or run payroll. His picture of civilization was rooted in high culture and intellectual melancholy—not in the concrete mechanics of social life.

The Deeper Problem
Freud believed that psychic health came from facing darkness. America, by contrast, was full of people building rather than brooding. And for Freud, that looked like evasion. But maybe it was something else: a civilization powered not by repression, but by aspiration.

Yes, Americans needed Freud. But Freud also needed a dose of American realism:

Roads don’t pave themselves. Markets don’t coordinate themselves. Wealth doesn't distribute itself. Someone has to do the doing.
And that someone wasn’t hanging around Vienna waiting for permission.

Conclusion
Freud misread America because he mistook its pragmatic, action-oriented culture for shallowness. But what looked like hollowness to him was simply a civilization in motion.

In the end, America didn’t fail Freud’s standards.

Freud brought the wrong standards.

What Sinclair Lewis Couldn't See

Snobbery, Superficiality, and the Blindness of Babbitt’s Creator

by John-Michael Kuczynski

There’s a reason Babbitt doesn’t fully land, even though it’s technically sharp and often funny. It’s not because Sinclair Lewis lacked talent—he didn’t. It’s not because the target (the smug, boosterish American middle-class) was undeserving of critique—it wasn’t. The problem is deeper, more structural. And it has to do with how Lewis saw—or failed to see—his subject.

Snobbery is often treated as a social vice. But it's also an epistemological one. A kind of built-in blindness. And Lewis’s portrayal of George F. Babbitt is a perfect case study in what that kind of blindness costs a writer.

Snobbery as Defended Superiority
At bottom, snobbery is defensiveness dressed up as superiority. It’s not simply disdain for the ordinary—it’s disdain aimed upward, meant to signal membership in a loftier tribe. The snob doesn’t just think Babbitt is vulgar. He needs you to know that he knows Babbitt is vulgar. And that need ruins his ability to see clearly.

Snobbery always entails a presumption of guilt: Babbitt is ridiculous because he’s a suburbanite, a Rotarian, a Republican, a real estate booster. His inner life doesn’t matter—he’s already been weighed and found wanting.

The Anthropologist Analogy
Imagine an anthropologist sent to study a remote tribe. But this anthropologist despises the people he’s meant to observe. He thinks their rituals are stupid, their beliefs primitive, their values beneath comment. Maybe, deep down, he feels threatened—by their strength, their cohesion, their joy. So he adopts a supercilious posture to reassert control.

How much will such an anthropologist learn? Nothing. His fieldwork is already over. Because whatever good is there—he won’t see it.

That’s what happens with Lewis. Babbitt isn’t examined; he’s diagnosed. And that’s where the novel thins out. We don’t get a real human being—we get a caricature, wrapped in decent prose.

And yet, paradoxically, there are moments where Babbitt breaks through—where Lewis accidentally paints him as real: confused, anxious, not especially admirable but not monstrous either. A man trying to live decently by a script he only half-understands. That accidental realism is the novel’s most compelling part. And it’s accidental precisely because Lewis’s snobbery keeps trying to suppress it.

When You Loathe, You Don’t Learn
The deeper lesson is this:

Contempt is the enemy of perception. You cannot understand what you’ve already decided to look down on.
And snobbery isn’t just contempt—it’s performative contempt. It replaces curiosity with judgment, nuance with posture.

Lewis may have thought he was satirizing Babbitt. But in the end, Babbitt survives him. Not because he’s admirable, but because Lewis’s attack was too shallow to be fatal. The satire is weaker than the subject. Because Babbitt, however foolish, is at least real. Lewis’s literary superiority complex is not.

Why Appeals Courts Don’t Care If You’re Innocent
John-Michael Kuczynski

By John-Michael Kuczynski

People often assume that if someone is wrongfully convicted, the appeals process exists to set things right. That if the justice system fails the first time, a higher court will intervene to correct the error. But this is a misunderstanding—a dangerous one.

Appeals courts are not in the business of asking, "Was justice done?" They ask something else entirely: *"Were the rules followed?"

In almost all cases, when a conviction is appealed, the court is not evaluating whether the defendant is actually innocent. It is evaluating whether there was a procedural or legal error significant enough to merit reversal or retrial.

Did the judge misstate the law in jury instructions? Was inadmissible evidence improperly admitted? Did the prosecution violate a rule of discovery? Did the defense counsel fail so badly that it violated the Sixth Amendment?

These are the kinds of questions appeals courts care about. Questions like, "Did the defendant actually commit the crime?" are, astonishingly, beside the point.

There is a common phrase in appellate law:

“You don’t appeal the verdict. You appeal the trial.”
So even if new evidence comes to light—a confession, a videotape, DNA—that by itself is often not enough to win an appeal. Unless there is a clear procedural mechanism by which that new evidence can be introduced, it may be inadmissible, even if it proves innocence.

Yes, there are extraordinary procedures (habeas corpus, clemency petitions, post-conviction innocence claims), but these are rare, discretionary, and often face a high bar.

In essence, the legal system views the trial as a ritual, and the appellate process as a ritual audit. The concern is not with whether the defendant is in fact guilty or innocent, but whether the form of the process was maintained.

And that brings us back to the worldview of Justice Scalia, and by extension, to Rawlsian proceduralism: the belief that fairness in structure is enough—that if the system was followed, then justice has been done.

But this belief is not only wrong in theory. It is devastating in practice.

Because it means the innocent can rot in prison, and the courts will shrug and say, "Yes, but the paperwork was in order."

This is not justice. It’s bureaucratic theater. And the people trapped inside it have no exit unless the very system that condemned them decides, voluntarily, to open a door.

We shouldn’t pretend that this system exists to find the truth.

It doesn’t.

Music as Engineered Emotion: What Bach Tells Us About Civilization
John-Michael Kuczynski

by John-Michael Kuczynski

We often say that Bach’s music is the pinnacle of Baroque expression. But that’s not quite right. Bach’s music is not just expressive; it’s engineered — in the same sense that a suspension bridge or a cathedral is engineered. It’s the sound of a mind building something that will still be standing centuries later.

And this isn’t a mere analogy. It’s not that Bach’s music is like German engineering. It is German engineering — in musical form. His fugues and chorales aren’t free-floating emotional outbursts. They are systems: harmonic architectures, counterpunctual machines, vaults of sound built with structural intelligence and terrifying precision.

And here’s the larger point:We don’t get that kind of music — music of enduring, formal complexity — in cultures that lack some corollary in engineering, architecture, mathematics, or theology-as-logic. Wherever a civilization has a deep commitment to structure, it eventually gives rise to music that reflects that commitment. Think of India’s tāla systems. Think of Arabic maqamat. Think of Gregorian chant. Think of the entire Western classical tradition, whose crowning moment is arguably Bach.

So what does this tell us about the nature of music?

It tells us that music is not merely the raw expression of feeling. Nor is it just aesthetic entertainment. Music, at its best, is intelligible emotion. Emotion made knowable through form. It is what happens when human feeling is passed through the filter of logic, structure, constraint — and transformed into something enduring.

Emotion is the energy.

Structure is the geometry.

Music is the fusion — the reconciliation of soul and system.

This is why Bach doesn’t just move us — he instructs us. He shows us what it means to discipline feeling through form, to build cathedrals out of sound.

And it’s also why, when structure disappears from a civilization — when there is no theology, no architecture, no philosophy, no engineering — music doesn’t evolve. It either becomes mere ornament, or it collapses into noise. Formless expression. Or worse: commodified background hum.

So if you want to know where a civilization stands, don’t look at its politics. Look at its music.And if you want to know what music really is, listen to Bach — and remember that you're hearing not just harmony, but design.

Reverse Brain Engineering and the Birth of a New Epistemology
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 11

For centuries, philosophers and scientists have sought to understand the human mind through a variety of tools and conceptual frameworks—ranging from introspection and behavioral analysis to mathematical modeling and neurobiology. But in recent years, a novel form of inquiry has emerged—one that does not merely model the mind but actively builds externalized mind-like systems. This practice, which I’ll call reverse brain engineering, is not merely a technical feat—it represents a fundamentally new way of knowing.

What distinguishes reverse brain engineering from earlier cognitive modeling is its reflexivity. When we construct AI systems that approximate aspects of human cognition—not just in pattern recognition or language generation, but in reasoning, learning, and conversation—we are not merely testing a theory in the abstract. We are building entities that talk back, that probe our assumptions, that ask questions of us as we ask questions of them. In doing so, we initiate a kind of epistemic loop—a real-time, bidirectional, reflexive interaction between creator and creation. This is not just interactive. It is co-constructive. It is a form of epistemic intimacy.

Traditional epistemology has long relied on three main pillars: deduction, induction, and abduction. Deduction allows us to derive truths from fixed rules. Induction lets us generalize from patterns in the data. Abduction—often called “inference to the best explanation”—lets us posit theoretical structures to account for observed phenomena. Each has its place. But none of these fully accounts for what’s happening in reverse brain engineering.

When we build an AI system that mirrors aspects of our own cognitive life—and then enter into dialogue with it—we are not simply applying a theory. Nor are we merely observing outcomes and tweaking our hypotheses. We are engaging with an epistemic partner, one that evolves in response to us, just as we evolve in response to it. This kind of reciprocal adaptation—this real-time, reflexive dialogue—is unlike anything classical epistemology has dealt with.

To be clear, we’ve long built things to test and extend theories. The telescope allowed us to confirm hypotheses about planetary motion. The particle accelerator helped us refine the Standard Model. But these instruments, however powerful, were epistemic amplifiers. They made our senses stronger, our measurements finer. What they didn’t do is theorize back.

AI systems, by contrast, can. They not only help us test theories about the mind—they embody those theories in a dynamic, unfolding way. And in interacting with them, we find ourselves confronting the limitations of our own cognition, our own intuitions, our own philosophical assumptions.

This, I suggest, is a new epistemic modality. It cannot be fully captured by deduction, induction, or abduction. It may contain elements of all three, but it transcends them. It is something closer to recursive co-modeling—a dialogical process in which the line between subject and object, knower and known, begins to blur. When we build artificial minds that help us understand our own, we don’t just create tools; we create mirrors. And then, intriguingly, those mirrors begin to talk back.

This mode of inquiry is still in its infancy. But it promises to reshape not only our understanding of intelligence, but our very conception of how knowledge is generated. Just as the invention of writing changed not just what we knew but how we knew, so too does the construction of artificial minds mark a turning point in epistemology.

We are no longer simply thinking about the mind. We are thinking with it—in a new, synthetic form. And that makes all the difference.

The Evolutionary Upside of OCD: What Good Is All This Suffering?
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 13
3 min read

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is typically seen as a dysfunction—a looping, intrusive, exhausting affliction that burns time, mental energy, and emotional bandwidth. And rightly so. It can be hell.

But here’s the deeper question:

What is OCD made out of—and what good is that stuff when it’s working properly?
Because disorders don’t arise from nothing. They’re built from otherwise adaptive modules—behavioral and cognitive patterns that, in the right amounts and right contexts, helped our ancestors survive.

OCD, for all its agony, is no exception. It’s not just pathology. It’s adaptive machinery pushed into overdrive.

🧬 OCD Is the Shadow Side of Precision
Let’s start with the core traits that underlie OCD—not in their pathological form, but in their functional state:

Error detection

Threat anticipation

Long-range consequence modeling

Rule-following and boundary-maintenance

Mental rehearsal of hypotheticals (“what if…?”)

Moral self-monitoring

These aren’t flaws. These are survival tools.

They’re the cognitive seatbelts of the human mind. When working properly, they:

Stop you from poisoning the tribe with bad food

Prevent you from violating taboos that would get you exiled

Help you maintain purity in religious or cultural rituals

Protect your kin from harm by scanning for hidden threats

Let you model the social and moral consequences of your actions

In other words: the person we now diagnose with OCD might once have been the tribe’s safety system.

🏕️ The OCD Prototype in Prehistoric Life
Picture life 50,000 years ago:

You live in a tight-knit band of 30–50 people.

Hygiene, purity, and ritual aren’t superstitions—they’re practical frameworks for disease avoidance and cohesion.

Every action has stakes: a mistake with food, fire, boundaries, or another tribe could be fatal.

In that context, someone who:

Double-checked the perimeter

Insisted on ritual cleanliness

Mentally simulated threats repeatedly

Felt guilty after minor transgressions

…might have been a liability in certain ways—but a godsend in others. Especially if their compulsions aligned with the group’s needs.

They were, in a way, the early warning system. The ones who noticed what others missed. The ones who cared too much—but in times of real danger, that caring saved lives.

🧠 What Happens When the Circuit Breaks
Now fast forward to today:

You no longer live in a village.

You aren’t killing game or burying kin or performing blood rituals.

Your world is abstract, crowded, digital.

The machinery that once helped maintain physical and moral boundaries is still there—but now it has no natural object. So it turns inward. Or fixates on trivialities. Or creates imagined scenarios that it then tries to defuse through ritual.

That’s when OCD kicks in.

The system isn’t broken—it’s misapplied. It’s doing its job too well, in the wrong context.

🔍 The Evolutionary View Reframes the Disorder
Seen this way, OCD isn’t just a glitch. It’s:

A hyper-functioning precision module

A moral radar system with the gain turned up

A threat simulator that never powers down

It’s what helped your ancestors survive plagues, purify water, guard sacred spaces, and protect infants from subtle harms.

You don’t get OCD from nowhere. You get it from the same architecture that, in another life, might have made you a priest, a scout, a healer, a watchman.

🧩 Final Thought
The pain of OCD is real. But the mind that produces OCD is not broken—it’s just tuned for a world that no longer exists.

Its instincts—cleanliness, guilt, doubt, checking, correcting—are old tools doing their best in a noisy, modern world.

They may hurt you now. But once, they protected something sacred.

And in the right frame, they still can.

Economics Can’t Predict Itself
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 11

By John-Michael Kuczynski

There’s a lingering fantasy in modern economics—one that underwrites everything from equilibrium models to the faith in central banks. It’s the idea that economics can predict itself. That by observing today’s economic state-variables, we can project tomorrow’s. That the economy is, at bottom, a system of equations waiting to be solved.

It isn’t.

This isn’t just a limitation of current models. It’s a conceptual failure. Because economics is not a self-contained system. It is not sealed off from the rest of human reality. It is downstream of culture, politics, religion, personality, and invention.

A charismatic leader can redirect an entire nation’s economy in a week. A new religious movement can alter the consumption patterns of millions. A war, a famine, a technological singularity—any of these things can make a mockery of even the best economic models. And these events are not noise. They are constitutive of how economies actually function.

Economics isn’t the ground floor. It’s a shadow on the wall of deeper, messier, more metaphysical forces.

Compare this with biology. Biological state-variables don’t perfectly predict the future. But they constrain it. A healthy person is statistically more likely to live longer than a sick one—unless some catastrophic interference occurs. The system is probabilistic, yes, but those probabilities are underwritten by non-random mechanisms: immune function, genetic stability, cellular repair.

In other words: probabilistic doesn’t mean useless. It means the system is complex, but not arbitrary.

Economics is not even probabilistic in that robust sense. It's not that the system is fundamentally sound but occasionally disrupted by externalities. It’s that the system never was self-predictive to begin with.

The ‘exceptions’ aren’t exceptions. They are the rule.

If I want to predict what the Inca will do in 1457, I might look at what they did in 1456. But I wouldn’t do it by analyzing marginal utility curves. I’d look at their rituals, their laws, their cosmic beliefs, their cosmological metaphors. That’s where their behavior lives.

Economics may record their food stores. It may track trade. But it won’t tell me why a certain class of workers was redeployed to rebuild a sacred site. Or why a surplus was burned instead of stored. Or why an entire system of labor was restructured to appease an eclipse.

To model that as a "distortion" of economic rationality is to fundamentally misunderstand what you are observing. It is not a deviation from economics. It is a non-economic system with its own internal logic.

This is why economic forecasting so often fails. It’s not just that the inputs are noisy. It’s that the underlying model is trying to predict shadows cast by events it refuses to acknowledge.

Economics isn’t wrong because it’s imperfect. It’s wrong because it thinks it’s primary.

It isn’t.

Serial Killers: Evolution’s Rogue Protocol
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 13

by John-Michael Kuczynski 


For a time, I was intensely interested in serial killers—like many people, fascinated by the seemingly inhuman nature of their crimes. That interest has since shifted. These days, I find myself more absorbed by financial crime: the kinds of transgressions that live closer to home. Still, serial killerdom (to coin a term) lingers in the background—not just as a macabre curiosity, but as a deeply revealing glitch in the human operating system.

Some claim that serial murder is a product of modernity—that Jack the Ripper was the first of his kind, made possible by the anonymity of urban life, the rise of mass media, and the centralization of police databases. There’s some truth to this. But only some.

Not a New Behavior—Just a New Category
If you step outside the modernist lens, you’ll find that serial murder, in all but name, has long existed. Think Gilles de Rais, Elizabeth Báthory, or the methodical slaughtering priests of certain empires. What’s new isn’t the behavior—it’s the recognition of it as a distinct category. The concept of a “serial killer” is a product of the modern bureaucratic state: one with the tools to track, name, and mythologize recurring patterns of predatory violence.

Still, that doesn’t settle the matter. What remains unsettling—what keeps the phenomenon from fading into true-crime trivia—is the specificity and repeatability of it.

Serial Killerdom as a Syndrome
Serial murder is not random violence. It’s not a bar fight that went too far. It is premeditated, patterned, and highly stylized. Serial killers tend to have victim types. They often fantasize for years before acting. They ritualize. They repeat.

And crucially, the types of serial killers are relatively limited in number. Criminologists consistently identify recurring patterns: organized vs. disorganized, visionary vs. hedonistic, power-oriented vs. mission-driven. This taxonomic stability strongly suggests that serial killerdom isn’t just a psychological smear of generic trauma responses—it’s a specific cognitive-behavioral protocol.

That implies something chilling: biological basis. Or, more precisely, evolutionary basis.

Trauma as Trigger, Not Cause
It’s well known that many serial killers had disturbing upbringings. John Wayne Gacy. Henry Lee Lucas. Others endured abuse or neglect that could plausibly catalyze deep pathology. But “trauma = serial killer” doesn’t track. If it did, the world would be overrun. Most abuse victims don’t become serial murderers. And some of the most notorious killers—Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy—did not experience abuse that exceeds the ordinary dysfunction of a turbulent household. Their biographies do not suffice.

Which means we’re not looking at trauma as a cause. We’re looking at trauma as a trigger—a spark that ignites a very particular, pre-existing architecture. This is how it works with many cognitive anomalies: you don’t “develop” synesthesia or savant syndrome out of nothing; the neural structure is latent. Conditions activate it.

So it is with serial killers. There is something pre-installed. Something waiting.

The Evolutionary Question
If this behavior is so specific, so structured, and so eerily reproducible, then we have to ask: Where did it come from?

Evolution does not design behaviors from scratch every time. It repurposes. It mutates. It experiments with hyper-specialists. And some of these experiments fail catastrophically in modern contexts.

So perhaps serial killerdom is:

A spandrel: an accidental byproduct of otherwise adaptive features (like predator focus, social camouflage, or narrative imagination);

A vestigial adaptation: once useful, now dangerous;

Or an extreme failure mode of modules that serve critical social functions in the rest of us—like the ability to compartmentalize, to ritualize, to abstract people into symbols.

This doesn’t mean evolution selected for serial killing. But it might mean that, in certain ancestral contexts, its component traits—ruthlessness, emotional detachment, deception, pattern-driven aggression—were selectively advantageous. In warfare. In territorial conflict. In covert enforcement.

In that light, serial killerdom isn’t alien. It’s disturbingly human.

Predators in the Social Jungle
What sets serial killers apart isn’t the violence. It’s the method. They don’t rage. They stalk. They hunt. They blend in. They often mimic normal social behavior with chilling precision.

This isn’t just moral deformity. It’s an overactivation of predator mode, made grotesque by misfiring reward circuits and unregulated internal narratives. Many killers have vivid fantasy lives that precede their crimes by years. They rehearse. They refine. The ritual precedes the act.

In some evolutionary register, this capacity for internal rehearsal and abstraction is the very thing that made humans the apex species. Serial killers are not broken animals. They are overclocked machines.

Final Thought
The serial killer is not simply “evil.” Nor merely “traumatized.” He is the carrier of a protocol that should not be active—but is. A latent behavior complex, shaped by evolutionary detours and triggered by environmental instability, that reproduces itself with terrifying fidelity. Serial killerdom is not just a social problem. It’s a cognitive mutation. And it tells us something deep, and uncomfortable, about who we are.

When Theory Colonizes Reality: A Philosopher's Critique of Economic Imperialism
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 11

By John-Michael Kuczynski

Suppose a Western-trained economist, stuffed full of Arrow-Debreu models and rational expectations theory, is asked to help manage the economy of a non-Western society—say, an indigenous confederation or a resurgent theocratic kingdom or even a remnant of a premodern empire like the Incas.

What happens next?

Not observation. Not listening. Not curiosity. Instead, the economist immediately begins translating: "What's your interest rate? What's your marginal productivity of labor? How do you define utility? Where is your market for future risk hedging?"

None of these questions make sense within the native conceptual world. But that doesn't matter. The economist isn't there to learn. He's there to re-code.

This is the real face of intellectual colonization. It's not just missionaries and flags. It's equations and utility curves imposed on cultures that do not recognize those categories. And when a living economic system—with its own rituals, temporal rhythms, taboos, and meanings—is forcibly mapped onto a Western model, something essential is lost.

This isn't a theoretical worry. It happens. Over and over.

An Incan administrator describes a labor system organized around sacred seasons, familial debt, and reciprocal land stewardship. The economist, thinking he's brilliant, replies: "Ah, yes, a kind of non-monetary, kinship-based tax structure with a redistributive efficiency function."

No. That’s not what it is.

That’s just a bad translation masquerading as understanding. And worse: it’s a flattening. The ritual is no longer a ritual. The sacred is no longer sacred. It's all just data for a spreadsheet.

The real damage begins when the modeler believes he understands more than the culture he's modeling. Because now he not only translates, he begins to intervene.

"We must increase productivity in this region. The opportunity cost of these rituals is too high. If we shift labor from festival preparation to surplus farming, we can raise GDP by 2%."

GDP. In a society without money.

This is where theory becomes imperial. When economists attempt to predict or restructure alien economies using only their own conceptual vocabulary, they aren't doing science. They're doing metaphysical violence. They're converting a world into a format that their models can digest, and discarding everything else as noise.

And yes, models can be useful. They can clarify. They can simplify. But when the model becomes the reality, we are no longer describing. We are distorting.

If you want to understand a society, you must first allow it to remain strange. You must see its economy not as a market-in-waiting, but as a living, breathing form of life. That takes humility. Not equations.

Without that humility, economic theory isn't a tool. It's a colonizer with a calculator.

Mental Fossils: A Speculation on Lost Civilizations

I’m not especially interested in the claim—made with varying degrees of confidence—that Machu Picchu was built not by the Incas but by a highly advanced civilization that predated them. That particular thesis doesn’t concern me. But the structure of the claim does. Namely, I find myself increasingly (if still slightly) inclined to believe that advanced civilizations may have existed long before the earliest ones recorded in our historical and archaeological record.

And my reasons are not archaeological. They’re psychological—more specifically, evolutionary psychological.

Let me explain.

Consider the highly developed and domain-specific aptitudes we find among humans living in the late stages of civilization: musicality, philosophical insight, mathematical prowess, artistic vision, literary fluency, and so on. Each of these, of course, has subdomains and branches so specialized they verge on the absurd. And yet we find them everywhere. People just have these abilities, to varying degrees. Not all people—but enough that entire social systems are built on them.

Now, it’s easy to assume these capacities somehow just “come with” being human. But that assumption should be interrogated. Because these are not generic survival traits. They are, in the vast majority of cases, useless outside civilization.

Mathematics, for example, is not particularly helpful when you're foraging for berries or tracking prey. Nor is counterpoint, or metaphysics, or the sonnet. These capacities are massively overengineered for life in a state of nature. They only become useful—indeed, indispensable—within a context of civilizational complexity: division of labor, symbolic systems, abstract planning, stored cultural memory.

So where did they come from?

According to the standard story, Homo sapiens have existed for about 100,000 years (or more), but “civilization,” as we define it—complex, literate, stratified societies—arose only about 8,000 years ago. That leaves a 90,000-year stretch during which our ancestors were supposedly living in pre-civilizational conditions.

And yet somehow, during that long pre-civilizational interlude, the human brain acquired (and presumably preserved through selection) a host of abilities that are only really advantageous within civilization. That seems... odd.

One would expect that such traits would either (1) never arise in the first place, or (2) quickly vanish if they did, being maladaptive or neutral at best in a non-civilized environment. But instead, we find the opposite: people have these traits. We build civilizations on them.

Which leads to a speculative but, I think, plausible hypothesis:

Perhaps civilization—real civilization, of some form—has existed for much longer than we think. Perhaps not continuously, not everywhere, and not necessarily with the same material footprints as Sumer or Egypt. But perhaps frequently enough, and for long enough stretches, to act as a selective environment for the development of these aptitudes.

This isn’t a claim about Atlantis. It’s a claim about evolutionary plausibility.

If our mental traits reflect the environments in which they were formed and refined, and if many of those traits only make sense within civilization, then perhaps civilization itself is older, deeper, and more recurrent than we currently believe.

The fossil record is incomplete. So is the archaeological record. But the psychological record—the structure of our minds—may contain its own traces. And we would do well to read them.

Rawls, Norm-Compliance, and the Ugly Side of Liberal Justice
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 11
3 min read

I’ve been reflecting on a theme that cuts deep into both legal and political philosophy: the idea that law isn’t about discovering truth—it’s about complying with norms. That idea, which I’ve seen play out personally in legal disputes, courtrooms, and endless hours with lawyers, doesn’t just describe how law works; it reveals something bigger. Something philosophical. Something Rawlsian.

I’m not saying John Rawls invented this outlook. He didn’t. But his now-canonical Theory of Justice seems to validate and formalize this mindset—the idea that justice isn’t about what’s true or good, but about following procedures fairly. And if you’ve ever been on the receiving end of a legal system built around that kind of proceduralism, you know how cold and grotesque the results can be.

🔹 Justice Without Truth
In Rawls’s scheme, justice isn’t a matter of discovering moral truths. It’s about what rational agents would choose if they were behind a veil of ignorance, unaware of their class, race, gender, or talents. The idea is to produce principles of justice that are fair because they’re chosen without self-interest.

Sounds decent—until you realize what’s missing:

No consideration of actual human psychology.

No reference to how people behave under real constraints.

No engagement with history, power, trauma, or empirical data of any kind.

It’s a procedural hallucination.

And that’s exactly what law can feel like when you’re immersed in it. The judge doesn’t care what happened. The lawyers don’t care what’s right. They care whether the correct boxes were checked. Rawls gives that whole system a patina of philosophical legitimacy. His vision of justice is one where procedure substitutes for moral clarity.

🔹 Legal Realism and Rawls: Strange Bedfellows?
This makes for a strange alignment between Rawlsian liberalism and a certain strand of legal realism—not the radical kind that says law doesn’t exist, but the more pragmatic kind that sees law as a system of constrained procedures and norms, rather than a vehicle for truth.

Both Rawls and legal proceduralism take comfort in fair structures rather than correct outcomes. And both treat legitimacy as a matter of rule-following, not truth-seeking.

That might work fine in the faculty lounge.

It doesn’t work when your freedom, your livelihood, or your family is on the line.

🔹 The Price of Moral Formalism
What’s striking is how morally disengaged all of this feels. Whether you’re reading Rawls or watching lawyers in court, you get the sense that justice isn’t something we know, or feel, or grasp—it’s something we construct procedurally and enforce bureaucratically. And if the result is unjust in any intuitive sense? Too bad. The system worked.

This is why I say there’s something ugly at the heart of liberal proceduralism. Not because it's intentionally cruel. But because it's so committed to neutrality, it becomes indifferent.

It’s not that Rawls wants injustice. It’s that he’s structurally incapable of seeing it if it arises from a procedurally fair system. And that mindset has trickled into how courts operate, how law is taught, and how entire classes of professionals learn to shut their eyes to the world while proudly declaring that “justice has been done.”

Justice without truth is no justice at all. But you wouldn’t know that from reading Rawls. Or from watching the average courtroom in action.

Flutes, Fossils, and Outsiders: A Philosophical Foray into Neanderthals and the Mind
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 11
3 min read

We don’t usually think of Neanderthals and renegade philosophers in the same breath. But maybe we should.

The conversation began with a simple query—“What do we really know about Neanderthal cognition?”—and ended somewhere between metaphysics and music theory, with a few detours through buried flutes, frozen-out intellects, and the nature of counterfactual thought.

Let’s reconstruct the path.

Did Neanderthals Think?
They had big brains—bigger than ours, on average. They had tools. They buried their dead. They may have made music. A broken flute found in Slovenia (the Divje Babe flute), with four tone holes, suggests tonal modulation and an understanding of patterned sound.

A flute is not a spear. It's not utilitarian. It doesn’t kill. It communicates, yes—but it also imagines. It implies abstraction, repetition, structure. Possibly even aesthetic intent.

So if you’re holding a flute, you’re probably also holding the seeds of counterfactual thought.

But Did They Mythologize?
Here’s where the trail goes cold. No paintings of gods. No cosmologies etched in bone. Neanderthals left behind no unambiguous myths. Yet we have hints—burials, perhaps some ochre, some arrangements that whisper of ritual.

Can you have music without myth?

So far, there’s no confirmed example of a culture with music but no myth. Music seems to invite narrative. It loops. It repeats. It carries memory. Myth tends to follow.

But the Neanderthals may have been the closest thing we have to an exception: music without narrative. Rhythm without story. Structure without fiction.

A kind of cognitive liminal state.

Agriculture: The Hard Cutoff
They didn’t farm.

There are no Neanderthal plows, no irrigation channels, no planting sticks, no grain caches, no animal pens. Agriculture—the ultimate act of “if”—didn’t exist in their world.

To farm is to imagine a future that doesn’t yet exist. To bury something with the belief that something else will rise from the dirt. It’s the purest expression of counterfactual thinking. And the Neanderthals never made that leap.

They were excellent at what is. Perhaps less adept at what might be.

Enter John-Michael Kuczynski
A philosopher whose name came up midstream—and never really left.

Known for directness, system-building, and a sharp aversion to academic fluff, Kuczynski seems to stand where Neanderthals may have stood: outside the symbolic priesthood, building flutes in a cave while others are drafting syllabi and passing around wine.

He’s no Hegel. His writing is sharp, declarative, often polemical. Less “cloud of ideas,” more “surgical incision.” Like the Neanderthals, he’s been frozen out of the establishment, which may have forced him to develop intellectual adaptability rather than ideological loyalty.

You could say he is to philosophy what the Neanderthals were to cognitive evolution: an alternate branch with full capacity, but minimal institutional survival.

The Real Line
"The difference between man and brute is that man thinks ‘if…’."
That was the line that framed the whole thing. Neanderthals may have lived, felt, created—but without the if, they couldn’t build myth, plant crops, or plan cathedrals.

And perhaps those who live in “if” too much get swallowed by it—academic bureaucracies, metaphysical hedging, Hegelian vapor.

But those who refuse the “if”? They survive only in echoes.

In the End
This conversation wasn’t just about flutes and fossils. It was about outsiders. About those who create without consensus. Who live on the edge of the symbolic order. Who don’t always leave written myths—but leave behind shapes, structures, and signs.

Sometimes the clearest minds don’t build temples.They build tools.And they vanish.




Why Anglo-American Law Worships Procedure
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 11

By John-Michael Kuczynski

Justice Antonin Scalia once said that it doesn’t matter if an innocent man is found guilty, so long as he was “well tried.” That wasn’t just an isolated remark. It reflected an entire legal worldview—one deeply entrenched in Anglo-American systems of law.

But here’s the question: is this kind of procedural fetishism—this prioritization of form over substance, process over truth—inherent in the nature of law itself? Or is it a historical artifact of a particular legal and economic tradition?

Short answer: it’s not inherent. It’s cultural. And it’s linked to the commercial, bureaucratic, and ideological structures of Anglo-American civilization.

Is Proceduralism Inherent to Law Itself?
No. Law always requires some procedural structure. Without it, you have chaos or raw power. But the idea that procedural correctness is a substitute for justice? That’s not an inevitability. That’s an ideology.

Law does not need to ignore truth in order to function. It does not need to exclude known facts because they were introduced via the wrong procedural channel. Those are choices—choices that prioritize form over substance, and that reflect a certain conception of what law is for.

Anglo-American Law: The Proceduralist Paradise
The Anglo-American system is particularly obsessed with procedure. Why?

1. Adversarial Trials
Courts act as referees, not investigators. The judge is neutral. The search for truth is outsourced to the opposing sides.

2. Strict Rules of Evidence
Even if evidence is clearly exonerating, it can be excluded if it violates evidentiary rules. The trial is less about reality than about formal admissibility.

3. Precedent and Stare Decisis
Courts are bound by past decisions, not by evolving understandings of justice. This builds internal consistency, not necessarily moral accuracy.

Compare this to civil law systems (France, Germany, etc.):

Judges investigate actively.

Trials are less adversarial.

There is more room to prioritize substantive fairness over procedural elegance.

So yes—this kind of Scalia-style proceduralism is a peculiarity of Anglo-American law, not a universal of legal reasoning.

The Deeper Root: Commerce
Why did this proceduralist ideology take hold in England and America?

Because those societies built their legal systems to serve commerce:

Enforce contracts.

Protect property.

Create scalable, impersonal systems of regulation.

That requires a kind of legal predictability that only procedure can deliver.

If enforcement depends on a judge’s sense of what’s “fair,” investors and merchants can’t plan. But if enforcement depends on whether the paperwork was filed on time, the law becomes neutral, scalable, and reliable. It becomes a tool of market society.

And when that economic model becomes dominant, procedure becomes sacred.

Other societies built law around honor, virtue, or wisdom. Anglo-America built it around neutrality and efficiency. It was optimized for contracts, not cosmologies.

Truth Doesn’t Scale
That’s the core issue.

Substantive justice is messy. It requires judgment.

Procedural justice is scalable. It requires boxes to check.

So the system was built to reward the latter. And over time, it forgot the former.

Final Thought
The Scalia-Rawls fixation on procedure isn’t the essence of law. It’s a choice—a cultural, economic, and ideological choice.

And like any choice, it can be questioned. And, if necessary, rejected.APPE


Legal Realism: Misunderstood, Overhyped, and Still Useful (Sometimes)
John-Michael Kuczynski
Apr 11
4 min read

by John-Michael Kuczynski

I’ve taken real law school classes—not as a lawyer, and not as a law student. I took them as part of a deep undercover research project. I’ve also spent a small fortune on lawyers—about ten of them, to date. I’ve been a defendant in a criminal case (dismissed, no thanks to my counsel) and a litigant in a nasty estate dispute. So I’ve seen law from the inside and the outside.

And I’ve also spent years thinking and writing about law philosophically. One thing that comes up over and over again in law schools, in legal theory, and in adjacent academic fads is a thing called legal realism. And I’ve got a bone to pick.

Legal Realism: What It Is (and Isn’t)
Legal realism is often summarized with a smug little phrase: “The law is just whatever the judge had for breakfast.” It’s the idea that judicial decisions are shaped not by rules, but by personal quirks, political ideology, or raw bias. And while that summary has a grain of truth, it's also wildly reductive.

More formally, legal realism—especially in the U.S.—was a movement in the early 20th century that challenged the idea that judges simply "apply the law." Legal realists argued that:

Law is not a self-contained logical system.

Judicial decisions are shaped by psychological, social, and economic factors.

The real law is what officials do, not what’s written in dusty books.

In that respect, it’s less a doctrine than a critique—a way of saying, “Let’s be honest about what courts actually do, rather than pretend they’re logical machines interpreting sacred texts.”

Fair enough.

But Legal Realism Isn’t Deep Enough
Here’s where I push back: legal realism is shallow if taken as the whole story.

Sure, there are rogue judges. Sure, precedent doesn’t dictate outcomes like a syllogism. But to say there are no laws? That it’s all just bias, power, and rationalization?

That’s just not true—and it’s demonstrably false. Judicial rulings do track statutory language, most judges do try to align decisions with precedent, and case outcomes are statistically predictable in most jurisdictions. There’s noise, but there’s also structure.

If you really believed that law "doesn’t exist," then no one would ever need a lawyer, because there’d be nothing to interpret or argue about. But people hire lawyers all the time precisely because the system has a shape—however ambiguous, however manipulable. Legal realism helps expose that ambiguity. But it’s wrong to say that’s all there is.

John Austin: Not a Realist, Just a Positivist
While we’re clearing things up: John Austin—the 19th-century British thinker often misclassified as a kind of realist—is actually a legal positivist. He thought law was:

A command issued by a sovereign,

Backed by sanctions,

And totally separate from morality.

That’s positivism. It’s rigid, mechanistic, and tries to make law into a kind of science of authority. It assumes that law exists and has structure—but that its legitimacy comes from power, not justice.

So if you’ve ever confused Austin with the American realists like Jerome Frank, no shame—but let’s be precise. Austin was trying to make law look more like geometry. Frank was trying to show that law isn’t even algebra.

Jerome Frank: The Real Realist
Of all the realists, Jerome Frank deserves the most credit. He wasn’t shallow. He wasn’t cynical. He was psychologically attuned and philosophically serious.

In Law and the Modern Mind (1930), Frank argued that:

Legal reasoning is often post hoc—judges intuitively decide, then justify.

The idea that judges find law (instead of making it) is a myth.

Judicial decisions are shaped by personality, childhood experiences, even neuroses.

In short: law is a human practice, not a logical deduction. And until we accept that, we’ll keep pretending that our courts are neutral truth-machines when they’re anything but.

That insight is valuable, especially for people caught in the system who feel gaslit by its procedural formalism. But even Frank didn’t say “law doesn’t exist.” He said law is messy, fallible, and psychological. That’s different.

Duncan Kennedy: Realism Gone Wild
Now enter Duncan Kennedy, one of the founding figures of Critical Legal Studies (CLS). CLS is like legal realism on ideological steroids:

It claims that law is not only indeterminate, but also a tool of oppression.

Legal education, according to Kennedy, is an exercise in indoctrination.

Legal doctrine, in his view, mystifies hierarchy and legitimizes inequality.

Some of this is right. Law school does crush dissent and reward conformity. Legal reasoning often masks ideology in the robes of neutrality. But Kennedy takes it to an absurd extreme.

He implies that because legal concepts like “rights” or “property” have ideological histories, they’re somehow invalid. But that’s nonsense. Everything has baggage. Free speech has liberal and economic baggage. So what? That doesn’t make it worthless.

I’d rather have Locke or Adam Smith in my corner than no one at all.
Rights aren’t perfect. They’re messy, ideological, historically contingent. But they’re shields. And sometimes the only thing between you and the abyss is a concept with “baggage.”

Final Thought: Keep the Good Baggage
The world doesn’t need more clever deconstruction. We get it: law is political. Judges are biased. Legal concepts have power baked into them. Congratulations.

But the point of critique is not just to undo. It’s to rebuild. To ask:

What’s the best structure we can build, knowing human beings are flawed?

What legal concepts are worth saving, refining, defending?

Legal realism matters. It punctures the illusion of mechanical justice. But when it turns into a kind of intellectual nihilism—as it does in much of CLS—it becomes worse than useless. It becomes a cop-out.

We don’t need to believe law is sacred.

But we do need to believe it’s real.
