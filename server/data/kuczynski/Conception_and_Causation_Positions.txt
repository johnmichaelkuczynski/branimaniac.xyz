POSITION STATEMENTS: KUCZYNSKI - CONCEPTION AND CAUSATION: SELECTED EARLY PHILOSOPHICAL PAPERS

================================================================================

EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DECEPTION

1. Human beings have always unconsciously known the theory of evolution, repressing this knowledge due to its threat to self-esteem.

2. The anatomical similarities between humans and other animals are so obvious that recognition of common ancestry is virtually inevitable.

3. When confronted with similar things, humans instinctively seek a common cause; the ability to accept coincidence marks non-instinctive thought.

4. Human self-conception as morally superior to animals is a defensive mechanism against the humiliating truth of our animal nature.

5. The biological basis of love and sex, involving excretory organs, reveals our fundamental animality despite idealized conceptions.

6. Sexual intercourse has always been regarded as indecent except under hyper-specific circumstances, proving awareness of our animal nature.

================================================================================

PROPOSITIONS, EMOTIONS, AND MORAL REALISM

7. A proposition is the non-linguistic entity meant by a complete sentence, not the sentence itself.

8. Emotions are beliefs or are at least belief-like in that they can be true or false, rational or irrational.

9. Emotions answer to canons of rationality, which only beliefs can do; therefore emotions must be beliefs.

10. Moral statements express emotions, and since emotions are beliefs capable of truth and falsity, moral statements can be true or false.

11. Emotivism, properly understood, is a form of moral realism rather than anti-realism.

================================================================================

NORMS AND LANGUAGE ACQUISITION

12. Awareness of norms cannot be acquired through behavioral conditioning; it must exist ab initio or not at all.

13. A society of normless individuals cannot collectively become aware of norms; norms cannot emerge from non-normative ingredients.

14. Understanding complex sentences presupposes grasping concepts; there is no way to reduce sentence comprehension to precognitive reactions.

15. To understand a complex sentence, one must grasp not just the concepts of its constituents but also the rules governing their composition.

16. A creature with purely de re awareness cannot make the leap to de dicto awareness through conditioning alone.

================================================================================

CONCEPTS AND MENTALESE

17. Lexical items do not come bundled the way concepts do; therefore lexical items cannot be our concepts, and we do not think in any language.

18. There is no such thing as Mentalese; we do not think in a language or symbolic code.

19. Constitutive relations among concepts are not containment relations among symbols.

20. The thought "that is a sphere" is different from, though constitutively connected with, the thought "that is a closed figure of uniform curvature."

21. Conceptual analysis and semantic analysis are not the same thing; a single semantic analysis may correspond to multiple conceptual analyses.

================================================================================

CONCEPTUAL HOLISM

22. Color concepts are not mutually definable, yet they are constitutively interconnected; one cannot grasp one color without grasping others.

23. Any concept has constitutive connections to other concepts; conceptual atomism is false.

24. One cannot represent a single property to oneself without being able to represent other properties; representational capacities come in networks.

25. To grasp a specific shade of color, one must be able to distinguish it from other colors and thus grasp multiple colors.

26. If a creature could represent only one shade of color, its concept of that shade would collapse into a concept of color in general.

27. Properties are individuated by their relations to other properties; grasping a property requires grasping its place in a space of properties.

28. Degree properties like "weighing 1000 lbs" obviously require grasping related properties; this point generalizes to all properties.

================================================================================

LANGUAGE AND REFERENCE

29. A language must comprise basic expressions; otherwise knowledge of any expression would presuppose knowledge of an infinitely large lexicon.

30. Proper names are not definite descriptions, as Kripke decisively showed.

31. What we think does not, by itself, establish what our words and sentences mean; semantic externalism is correct.

32. Twin Earth cases show that the meanings of natural kind terms are not wholly determined by internal psychological states.

33. Content internalism is compatible with semantic externalism; linguistic meaning and cognitive content are distinct.

34. Reference-fixing should be distinguished from meaning-giving; this distinction dissolves many puzzles about concepts.

================================================================================

CONCEPTION AND IDENTIFICATION

35. To have a concept of a thing is to know some proposition that describes that thing.

36. Knowledge of an existential proposition that uniquely describes x suffices for the ability to think about x.

37. Conception is sustained by knowledge of uniquely individuating descriptions, which may include indexical elements.

38. Recognition consists in seeing that one object satisfies two existence claims previously thought to be satisfied by different objects.

================================================================================

PHENOMENAL CONTENT AND INTENTIONALISM

39. Phenomenal content does not supervene on propositional content; intentionalism is false.

40. Phenomenal content does not supervene on non-propositional representational content either.

41. Intentionalism over-predicts the amount of information borne by sensations.

42. A tickle or twinge is too simple and homogeneous to bear fine-grained propositions about anatomical structures.

43. Creatures can experience phenomenal contents like woozy feelings without possessing vast networks of representational capacities.

44. If intentionalism were true, a twinge would deliver vastly more information than such sensations actually deliver.

45. Phenomenal content is something altogether different from representational content—not identical with or supervenient on it.

46. Even restricted intentionalism (within sensory modalities) collapses into non-intentionalism upon examination.

47. There is no absolute correspondence between phenomenal and representational content.

48. Different phenomenal contents, even within the same modality, can bear the same representational content.

49. The relationship between phenomenal contents and their physical causes is like a "rule of projection" that could be different.

================================================================================

COMPUTATIONAL THEORY OF MIND

50. The Computational Theory of Mind (CTM) is false because there is no purely morphological characterization of syntax.

51. There is no purely syntactic characterization of logical truth; adequate characterizations must be partially semantic.

52. The only way to sensitize a thing to logical form is to sensitize it to semantics.

53. Turing machines do not compute in the relevant sense because they do not respond to semantics.

54. Adding numbers is never a purely mechanical, cognition-free operation even when done by the "quick and dirty" method.

55. A representationally innocent entity generating patterns of shapes does not constitute genuine computation.

56. Computing involves being sensitive to logical form, and logical form is buried in semantics.

================================================================================

FUNCTIONALISM AND MENTAL CAUSATION

57. The Ramsey-Lewis sentence method for defining theoretical terms is useless because functionalism cannot be articulated without vicious circularity.

58. Functionalism fails because it cannot non-circularly specify the mental states in terms of which functional roles are defined.

59. Content externalism strips mental content of causal efficacy; if externalism is true, content cannot explain behavior.

60. Program causes (as defined by Jackson and Pettit) do not rescue content externalism from the causal impotence objection.

61. Mental causation requires that mental content be causally relevant in a way externalism cannot accommodate.

62. Davidson's anomalous monism leads to epiphenomenalism about the mental.

================================================================================

FODOR AND CONCEPTUAL ATOMISM

63. Jerry Fodor's computationalism is pseudo-computationalism because he cannot adequately account for how syntax tracks semantics.

64. Fodor's main argument for conceptual atomism fails because constitutive connections are not containment relations.

65. Fodor confuses the claim that concepts are not decomposable with the claim that concepts lack constitutive connections to others.

66. Non-atomism does not require inferential role semantics (IRS); the inference from one to the other is fallacious.

67. Inferential role semantics faces the "error objection": if inferential roles define concepts, misapplication becomes impossible.

68. Inferential role semantics leads to an untenable holism where no two people can grasp the same proposition.

================================================================================

PROPOSITIONS AND TRUTH

69. The bundle theory of personal identity is defensible when properly understood.

70. Propositions are sets of properties; truth is the instantiation of all members of that set.

71. A proposition like "Smith punches Jones" is a set containing properties corresponding to Smith, Jones, and the punching relation.

72. For a proposition to be true is for all of its component properties to be instantiated.

73. Propositions have decompositional structure; they are not merely specified by truth-conditions.

74. Analytically equivalent propositions can convey very different information.

75. Analytic propositions do typically convey information, contrary to Lewis's model.

================================================================================

CONFIRMATION AND INDUCTION

76. Hempel's paradox is solved by recognizing that accidental generalizations do not receive support from their instances.

77. Only principled (nomic) generalizations receive confirmational support from their instances.

78. "If x is heated metal, x expands" and "If x isn't expanding, x isn't heated metal" are not confirmationally equivalent when read nomically.

79. Negative facts (like not being heated metal) are not fit to stand in nomic relations because they are not events or constituted by events.

80. A thing's not having a property is not nomically connected to anything, unlike a thing's having a property.

81. Inductions by enumeration are actually crypto-inferences to the best explanation.

================================================================================

FORMAL TRUTH AND LOGIC

82. Formal truth is truth by virtue of being an instance of a sentence-schema all of whose instances are true.

83. Formal truth is not identical with syntactic truth; there is no purely morphological characterization of logical form.

84. The equation of formal truth with syntactic truth is viciously circular.

85. Not all logical truths are formal truths; logic cannot be identified with the study of formal truth.

86. The most fundamental truths of logic must consist of non-formal, analytic truths.

87. The linguistic theory of logical truth (that logical truths are true by convention) is false.

88. Logical truths are not true merely in virtue of the meanings of words or linguistic conventions.

================================================================================

DUALISM, TIME, AND CAUSATION

89. Conceivability sometimes entails possibility, providing a neo-Cartesian argument for dualism.

90. If mental properties are not identical with physical properties, and identity is necessary, then dualism follows.

91. Time travel is an incoherent concept.

92. Probabilistic causation is a genuine form of causation distinct from deterministic causation.

93. Simulated thought is not actual thought; genuine mental processes cannot be simulated by non-mental processes.

94. Davidson's views on rationality embody fundamental misconceptions.

================================================================================

FOUNDATIONALISM AND PERCEPTION

95. Foundationalism about knowledge is compatible with non-atomism about concepts.

96. Intentionalism (the view that phenomenal properties are representational properties) fails both in restricted and unrestricted forms.

97. The veil of perception problem is exacerbated by externalism, not solved by it.

98. Representationalism about perception faces serious objections from the nature of phenomenal experience.

================================================================================

SENTENCE MEANING AND UNDERSTANDING

99. Understanding a sentence requires knowing multiple existence claims and their connections.

100. Identification is relative to background knowledge; being able to identify an object means connecting it to background knowledge.

101. A parrot cannot really say "it's getting hotter" because it lacks grasp of concepts and semantic rules.

102. For a sentence to have meaning for a speaker, it must have internal structure connected to concepts.

103. The meaning of complex sentences is a resultant, not a mere heaping together, of component meanings.

104. The word "fire" in isolation has the same semantics as in complex sentences; meaning operates through concepts uniformly.

================================================================================

INTROSPECTION AND PHENOMENAL KNOWLEDGE

105. Sense perceptions have existential content; the content of a perception is given by some bit of existential information.

106. Introspection, while limited, is reasonably reliable for apprehending the nature of phenomenal contents.

107. If phenomenal contents deliver information, our conscious minds must retrieve this information, suggesting we know our phenomenal contents well.
