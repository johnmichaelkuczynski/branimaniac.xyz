# 100 Positions from "How Is Rationalization Possible?"

## On Self-Deception and Its Possibility

1. People routinely deceive themselves, and it would be hard to exaggerate how often or how discrepantly from truth.

2. The view that self-deception is conceptually incoherent is itself a case of self-deception.

3. The view that self-deception is conceptually incoherent is demonstrably false.

4. There are two distinct kinds of repression (repression₁ and repression₂).

5. There are correspondingly two kinds of self-deception, as a corollary of there being two kinds of repression.

## On Repression₁ (Epistemic Avoidance)

6. Repression₁ involves inaction—a deliberate, conscious intention not to follow up on suggestive leads.

7. Repression₁ involves suspecting but not knowing, and wanting to keep it that way.

8. Repression₁ involves not exercising due diligence in interpreting existing evidence or generating new evidence.

9. Repression₁ does not involve driving an already-formed belief into the unconscious.

10. Repression₁ involves abstaining from doing things that would generate evidence making acceptance of a belief de rigueur.

11. The customary conception of repression (CCR) is erroneous.

12. Suspicion is not knowledge, and there is nothing paradoxical about not wanting to pursue suspicions one suspects would lead to unwanted knowledge.

13. One can know what sort of thing something is without knowing which particular thing it is.

## On Repression₂ (Dissociation of Existing Beliefs)

14. Repression₂ involves already-formed beliefs.

15. The essence of repression₂ is dissociation.

16. To repress₂ an idea is to take away its "vote" in decision-making—to give it no weight.

17. Repression₂ involves blinding oneself to an existing belief one has already formed.

## On the Mechanisms Enabling Repression

18. The possibility of self-deception is a consequence of three facts about the mind.

19. The mind is not a perfectly unified entity; it consists of parts that communicate imperfectly.

20. There are two very different ways of being aware of something: knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description.

21. There are two very different senses in which mental content can be "conscious": as a constituent of consciousness, or as something one is conscious of.

22. The word "conscious" is used equivocally—sometimes meaning "constituent of consciousness," sometimes meaning "mental entity we are directly conscious of."

## On the Nature of Beliefs and Propositional Attitudes

23. All mental entities that aren't constituents of consciousness are, in one sense, unconscious.

24. Beliefs exist and are operative even when one is not conscious of them.

25. A belief can be psychologically active as a belief even when not the object of consciousness.

26. Propositional attitudes are not constituents of consciousness.

27. One can, without knowing it, have two distinct concepts of one of one's own propositional attitudes.

28. Emotions are distinct from their manifestations in consciousness.

29. Emotions are enduring psychological structures, not ephemeral events.

30. Beliefs, like emotions, are enduring structures distinguishable from the constituents of consciousness they may cause.

31. All propositional attitudes are enduring structures distinguishable from any constituents of consciousness for whose existence they're responsible.

32. Given two qualitatively distinct conscious events both expressing one propositional attitude, there isn't necessarily reason to recognize the attitude in both.

33. One can have very different attitudes towards a given one of one's own propositional attitudes without knowing it.

## On Judgment and Self-Knowledge

34. Having a propositional attitude is distinct from knowing that one has it.

35. Knowing one feels a certain way involves making a judgment about one's mental state.

36. Propositional attitudes never appear in consciousness in propria persona, except indirectly as rocks and trees do.

37. What is in consciousness is at most a representative or derivative of a propositional attitude.

38. One must "synthesize" indications of one's attitudes; one must make a judgment that they express an enduring attitude.

39. These synthesis-judgments are often quite wrong.

40. We sometimes like those toward whom we have constant surges of rage; we sometimes dislike those who make us feel good.

## On Limitations of Agency Over Mental Processes

41. One's agency only goes so far; much within one's mind falls outside its scope.

42. Judgment-producing processes lie beyond the reach of what one can choose to occur.

43. It is not within one's power to completely suspend judgment-producing processes.

44. One can no more choose to stop making judgments than choose to stop digesting food.

45. One can choose courses of action that redirect automatically-occurring mental activity that yields judgments.

46. Unless one damages one's brain, the stream of judgment-making activity will eventually yield the judgments one doesn't want.

## On Anxiety and Repression₁

47. The anxiety felt when repression₁ breaks down isn't from unconscious knowledge entering consciousness.

48. It results from one's thought-processes following up on clues despite attempts to stymie them.

49. Every case of repression₁ involves intrapsychic conflict, but not between unconscious knowledge and conscious ignorance.

50. The conflict in repression₁ is between a wish to know the truth and a wish not to know it.

## On Conditions for Repression₂

51. For a propositional attitude to be a candidate for repression₂, it must be a source of conflict within one's psyche.

52. It isn't enough for something to be painful for it to be repressed₂.

53. People typically choose to suppress painful memories, but suppression isn't repression₂.

54. One represses₂ knowledge that would severely disrupt one's life-structure if consciously admitted.

## On the Value and Dangers of Repression₂

55. Repression₂ isn't always bad; in many contexts, it's optimal.

56. A person who never repressed₂ anything would quickly go mad.

57. Repressions₂ are necessary.

58. Repressions₂ outlive their usefulness—circumstances change but the repression persists.

59. Repression₂ isn't a one-off affair; it is an ongoing process.

60. Each instance of repression₂ creates holes in one's knowledge that must be explained away.

61. These explanations cannot be genuine and each incentivizes more bogus, anomaly-creating explanations.

62. The need to plug these holes disposes one to devalue truth and hyper-value illegitimate reasoning methods.

63. The result of sustained repression₂ is loss of both ratiocinative and ethical integrity.

## On Factors Conducive to Repression₂

64. One can know something without that thing being obvious to one.

65. It's harder to repress₂ knowledge of the obvious than of the non-obvious.

66. Inference-based knowledge is easier to repress₂ than sense-based knowledge.

67. People can repress₂ knowledge of totally obvious truths, but this requires telling oneself one isn't capable of knowing truth.

68. Complete loss of faith in one's ratiocinative ability usually creates more conflict than it eliminates.

69. In most cases of repression₂, there must be "plausible deniability."

70. The things one represses₂ tend to involve judgment-calls rather than pure sense-perception.

71. If a belief concerns something personal, one's standard of proof tends to be ridiculously high.

## On Freud's Principal Claims

72. Nobody is perfectly transparent to himself; nobody is conscious of everything in his mind.

73. Some mental contents are readily made conscious (pre-conscious); others are kept unconscious because distressing.

74. Repressed entities weren't destroyed; the subject merely blinded himself to them.

75. Desires arising from repressed material are necessarily intense and the subject experiences intolerable frustration until discharged.

76. Such desires cannot be discharged unless they employ subterfuge, since conscious intention to gratify them is impossible.

77. Subterfuges are of two types: disguise as an acceptable desire, or expression as a symptom.

## On Opposition to Freud

78. Arguments against Freud's contentions are pitifully weak and involve regressions to crude, demonstrably false positions.

79. The positions "we're computers," "there is no consciousness," "there are no minds," "the mind is completely transparent to itself" are all untenable.

80. Eliminativism about propositional attitudes ("folk psychology") is false.

81. Willful denials of the obvious are touted as "scientific" and "rigorous" without warrant.

82. While it's good not to impute minds to stones, it's obviously not good not to impute them to people.

83. The projector itself cannot be a projection—one cannot eliminate the mental by treating it as projection.

## On the Mechanism of Repression₂ (Detailed)

84. Beliefs are inert except to the extent one draws consequences from them and allows them to engage other beliefs.

85. Some inferences are made involuntarily, but one has at least some control over what sorts of inferences one's mind makes.

86. One can so structure one's life that a belief, though still conscious, is isolated—prevented from engaging other beliefs.

87. By de-operationalizing acceptance of a fact, one can cease to have more than abstract, formal understanding of it.

88. Most data-synthesis occurs below the threshold of consciousness.

89. Decisions about what goes on in one's mind are of limited scope—they don't directly affect deeper strata.

90. One cannot "uninstall" a belief by tinkering with its representations in consciousness.

91. The conscious representative of a repressed₂ belief becomes an innocuous shell, but the belief still lives on.

92. Since one no longer acknowledges the repressed belief's existence, it must insinuate itself into intentions or be expressed as symptoms.

## On Both Forms of Repression

93. Both repression₁ and repression₂ involve conflict between conscious and unconscious forces within oneself.

94. Both forms of repression involve constructing and operationalizing a narrative alternative to reality.

95. Both forms of repression involve rationalization.

96. Without rationalization, it is hard if not impossible to repress an idea and keep it repressed.

97. Rationalization-construction is more heavily involved in keeping ideas repressed than in initially repressing them.

## On Psychology as a Discipline

98. The science of psychology has itself become a means by which people rationalize attempts to repress obvious psychodynamic truths.

99. Brain-science, to the extent it's relevant to psychology, is parasitic on psychological knowledge.

100. The denial of emotions is itself a thoroughly emotional position, and the denial of repression is itself an instance of repression.
