2. One must never do wrong, even in return for wrong suffered.
3. Wrongdoing is always bad and dishonorable for the person who does it.

10. The laws gave him birth, nurtured him, and educated him.
11. He had the option to leave Athens if he disliked its laws.
12. He never chose to emigrate, even for visits, proving his satisfaction.

14. Escaping would destroy the laws and the entire city.
15. If private individuals could nullify court judgments, the city could not function.
16. If he escapes, he will be seen as an enemy of Athens in other cities.
17. Other cities will view him as a subverter of laws.
18. His friends will be in danger for aiding his escape.
19. His children will be exiled or lose their Athenian citizenship.
20. His act will not benefit his children if he raises them in disgrace in exile.
21. To go into exile is to live by clinging to life at all costs.
22. He would be living a life of cowardice, not principle.
23. He would be acting out of fear of death, which he previously claimed not to fear.
24. The opinion of the many (the public) is not the one that matters.
25. Only the opinion of the reasonable person, the one who understands justice, matters.
26. One should value good opinions and disregard bad ones.
27. The many cannot make a man wise or foolish; their power is accidental.

39. His death will be a fulfillment of justice as understood by the social contract.
40. His friends (like Crito) are motivated by love, but love must not override justice.
41. Crito is concerned with reputation—what "the many" will think of him for not saving Socrates.
42. Socrates is concerned only with what is right.
43. The philosophical life requires consistency between word and deed.
44. To flee would make his entire life's defense of law and justice a hypocrisy.
45. The divine sign (daimonion) has not opposed him, implying this path is correct.
46. He must follow the logical argument (logos) that proves escape is unjust.
47. He will go to his death as a man who has been wronged by people, not by justice itself.
48. He owes a debt of gratitude to the Laws that cannot be repaid by destroying them.
49. The citizen is like a child or slave to the Laws, bound to obey.
50. To disobey is to strike at the parent who raised you.

POSITION STATEMENT FOR Charmides

**Position Statements from Plato's *Charmides***

1. The dialogue's central question is: What is temperance (*sōphrosynē*)?
2. Temperance is a kind of quietness.
3. Temperance is modesty.
4. Temperance is doing one’s own business.
5. Temperance is self-knowledge.
6. Temperance is the knowledge of what one knows and does not know.
7. Temperance is the knowledge of knowledge itself.
8. Temperance is the knowledge of the absence of knowledge.
9. Temperance is the only knowledge that benefits its possessor.
10. A science of science would govern all other sciences.
11. The knowledge of knowledge would allow one to distinguish between the true knower and the ignoramus.
12. Temperance, as the knowledge of knowledge and ignorance, would make a man know himself.
13. Such self-knowledge would lead to living well.
14. But a science that knows only itself and other sciences, but not their subject matter, is problematic.
15. The physician knows health, not merely the knowledge of health.
16. A ruler benefits his subjects through the specific knowledge of good and evil, not through meta-knowledge.
17. Temperance defined as pure self-knowledge may have no practical product.
18. The ultimate good is not knowledge alone, but the knowledge of good and evil.
19. A city of temperate men (as self-knowers) might be pleasant but not necessarily happy or functional.
20. Without knowledge of good and evil, other knowledge is useless or harmful.
21. The argument ends in *aporia*—no satisfactory definition is found.
22. Socrates professes his own ignorance of the answer.
23. Charmides is beautiful, both in body and seemingly in soul.
24. Charmides is also young and of noble lineage.
25. Socrates is physically attracted to Charmides.
26. Socrates’ examination of Charmides is also a test of his soul.
27. Critias is Charmides’ guardian and a prominent intellectual.
28. Critias later became one of the violent Thirty Tyrants.
29. The dialogue hints at the future corruption of Critias.
30. True temperance should lead to good action, not just abstract knowledge.
31. The dialogue demonstrates the Socratic method of definition and refutation.
32. Proposed definitions are tested for logical consistency and comprehensiveness.
33. A definition must apply to all instances of the virtue.
34. A definition must distinguish the virtue from all other things.
35. “Doing one’s own business” is linked to justice in *Republic* but found insufficient for temperance here.
36. The discussion moves from behavioral definitions to epistemological ones.
37. Self-knowledge is established as a crucially important concept.
38. The dialogue raises the question of whether virtue is a form of knowledge.
39. It questions whether all knowledge is beneficial by nature.
40. The final, implied position may be that temperance is the knowledge of good and evil as it pertains to oneself.
41. The dialogue is set in a wrestling school, a place of physical training.
42. There is an analogy between caring for the body and caring for the soul.
43. Socrates claims to know a cure for Charmides’ headache—a charm and a leaf.
44. The charm requires the leaf to be applied with an incantation.
45. The true charm is beautiful words that implant temperance in the soul.
46. A soul cured by temperance makes the body healthy.
47. The examination of the definition is the cure itself.
48. The dialogue is ironic: Socrates examines the boy while claiming to seek the cure from him.
49. The political subtext suggests Athenian aristocracy lacked true self-knowledge.
50. The search for the definition, not its finding, is the philosophical activity that cultivates the soul.

POSITION STATEMENT FOR Laches


**Position Statements from Plato's *Laches***

1. The dialogue's central question is: What is courage (*andreia*)?
2. Courage is standing firm in battle and not fleeing.
3. Courage is a kind of endurance of the soul.
4. Courage is wise endurance.
5. Courage is knowledge of what is and is not to be feared.
6. That which is to be feared is future evil.
7. That which is to be confident about is future good.
8. Courage, therefore, is the knowledge of future good and evil.
9. But knowledge of future good and evil is the same as knowledge of all good and evil—past, present, and future.
10. This knowledge is identical to virtue as a whole.
11. Thus, courage defined as this knowledge is not a part of virtue, but the whole of virtue.
12. This contradicts the initial premise that courage is a *part* of virtue.
13. The argument ends in *aporia*—no satisfactory definition is found.
14. Socrates professes his ignorance alongside the generals.
15. The practical catalyst is deciding what education (specifically, armed fighting) is best for young men.
16. The true education sought is not for the body, but for the soul—toward virtue.
17. Lysimachus and Melesias, the fathers seeking advice, lack notable achievements and wish better for their sons.
18. Generals Laches and Nicias are consulted as presumed experts on matters of courage.
19. Laches defines courage first, based on experience.
20. Nicias defines courage as a kind of wisdom or knowledge.
21. Socrates tests each definition for consistency and universality.
22. A definition must apply to all instances of courage (e.g., in illness, at sea, in poverty).
23. Standing firm is not always courageous; tactical retreat can be courageous.
24. Endurance can be foolish and harmful if not guided by knowledge.
25. Therefore, courage must be combined with wisdom.
26. Nicias's definition (knowledge of what is to be feared) is a Socratic formulation.
27. Socrates then cross-examines Nicias's definition to its problematic conclusion.
28. The knowledge in question cannot be limited to future events alone.
29. The expert in good and evil, in all times, is truly courageous—but also fully virtuous.
30. Courage, if it is knowledge, cannot be separated from the complete knowledge of virtue.
31. The dialogue models the need to consult not just "experts" but those who truly understand the subject—the philosophers.
32. Laches admires Socrates's consistency between his words at the Battle of Delium and his philosophical discourse.
33. True expertise requires giving an account (*logos*) of one's knowledge.
34. The generals, while brave in action, cannot give a satisfactory account of courage.
35. The search itself is valuable, even if it fails to find an answer.
36. The dialogue demonstrates the unity of the virtues: to possess one (as knowledge) is to possess them all.
37. It critiques traditional, experience-based Athenian education.
38. It suggests that virtue is not simply taught by technical masters (like fighting instructors).
39. The true teacher of virtue remains an unanswered question.
40. The participants agree to seek the best teachers for their sons, starting with Socrates himself.
41. Courage is initially associated with the military class but is shown to be a universal quality.
42. The setting is public, after a demonstration of armed combat.
43. The inquiry moves from a practical question to a profound philosophical investigation.
44. Socrates acts as a midwife, drawing out and testing the beliefs of others.
45. The fathers are urged to participate in the care of their sons' souls, not delegate it.
46. The failure to define courage reveals the complexity of the concept.
47. Implicitly, courage may involve correct judgment about true goods and evils, not just dangers.
48. The dialogue highlights the Socratic principle that virtue is knowledge.
49. It also highlights the paradox that if virtue is knowledge, it should be teachable—yet no teachers exist.
50. The philosophical search, undertaken with humility and persistence, is itself a courageous act.


POSITION STATEMENT Lysis

**Position Statements from Plato's *Lysis***

1. The dialogue's central question is: What is friendship (*philia*)?
2. Friendship requires mutual liking between two persons.
3. One cannot be friends with someone who dislikes them.
4. A friend must be useful to their friend.
5. The bad cannot be friends, as they are unreliable and harmful.
6. The good, being self-sufficient, have no need of friends.
7. Friendship occurs between those who are neither wholly good nor wholly bad.
8. The neither-good-nor-bad becomes friend of the good because of the presence of evil (e.g., illness desires medicine).
9. Desire is the cause of friendship.
10. One desires what one lacks.
11. One loves what belongs to oneself (the *oikeion*).
12. What belongs to oneself is what is akin or similar to one's nature.
13. Therefore, the like is friend to the like.
14. But bad men, being alike in badness, harm each other and cannot be true friends.
15. Therefore, only the good can be friends with the good.
16. Yet the good, being alike and self-sufficient, may not *need* friendship.
17. Alternatively, the unlike is friend to the unlike (e.g., dry desires wet).
18. But extreme opposites (e.g., justice and injustice) cannot be friends.
19. Therefore, what is neither wholly alike nor wholly unlike may be the basis of friendship.
20. The primary object of love is the ultimate good for the sake of which all intermediate things are loved.
21. We love things for the sake of some final good, the "first friend" (*prōton philon*).
22. That "first friend" is the true object of all desire and friendship.
23. One who is loved may not necessarily love in return (e.g., a boy may not love his admirer).
24. Thus, friendship may be one-sided, not mutual.
25. Parents love children even when children do not reciprocate fully.
26. Friendship may be based on utility, but utility is unstable and changes.
27. Genuine friendship must be based on something permanent.
28. The dialogue ends in *aporia*—no satisfactory definition is found.
29. Socrates professes ignorance of what a friend is.
30. The characters Lysis and Menexenus are young boys, objects of pedagogical and possibly erotic interest.
31. Hippothales is in love with Lysis and wishes to learn how to converse with him.
32. Socrates demonstrates how to converse with a beloved—by humbling him, not flattering him.
33. True care for a friend involves improving their soul, not indulging them.
34. Socrates proves to Lysis that his parents do not fully trust him until he acquires wisdom.
35. Friendship is linked to the possession of wisdom, which makes one useful and free.
36. The dialogue explores the link between friendship, desire, and the good.
37. Friendship is a fundamental human experience that resists simple definition.
38. The search for the definition is itself a friendly, shared activity.
39. The interlocutors themselves become friends through philosophizing.
40. The "first friend" concept suggests friendship is ultimately oriented toward the Form of the Good.
41. Friendship may be a means by which the neither-good-nor-bid soul moves toward the good.
42. The possibility of non-reciprocal love challenges the mutual-affection model.
43. Friendship is distinct from mere kinship or familiarity.
44. Socrates uses complex, sometimes contradictory, arguments to provoke thought.
45. The setting is a new wrestling school at the edge of the city, a liminal space.
46. The dialogue mixes logical analysis with dramatic playfulness.
47. It implicitly criticizes pederastic conventions that prioritize possession over improvement.
48. True friendship requires a shared pursuit of wisdom.
49. The inability to define friendship underscores its mysterious, foundational role in human life.
50. The philosophical investigation, though inconclusive, binds the participants in a common search—an image of friendship itself.

POSITION STATEMENT FOR Euthyphro 

**Position Statements from Plato's *Euthyphro***

1. The dialogue's central question is: What is piety (*to hosion*)?
2. Piety is prosecuting the wrongdoer, regardless of their identity.
3. Piety is what is dear to the gods (*theophile*).
4. The gods are in a state of discord and disagree about what is just, noble, and good.
5. Therefore, the same things are both loved and hated by different gods.
6. The same action could then be pious and impious if loved by some gods and hated by others.
7. Piety cannot be defined simply as "what is loved by the gods" if the gods disagree.
8. Revised: Piety is what is loved by **all** the gods.
9. This leads to the central dilemma: Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved?
10. If the pious is loved because it is pious, then its piety exists independently of the gods' love.
11. If it is pious because it is loved, then its piety is arbitrary, dependent on divine whim.
12. The gods love the pious because it is pious; its nature causes the love, not vice versa.
13. Therefore, piety is a distinct quality that the gods recognize.
14. Piety is a part of justice: it is the part concerned with care (*therapeia*) of the gods.
15. Care for the gods is like a servant's care for a master, aimed at benefiting the object of care.
16. But human care cannot benefit the gods, who are already perfect.
17. Therefore, piety is a form of service (*hyperetikē*) to the gods.
18. This service is like that of slaves to masters: we do what they command.
19. Piety is then a sort of knowledge of how to give to and beg from the gods—a trading skill.
20. We give honor, reverence, and gratitude; we beg for what we need.
21. But this reduces piety to a commercial exchange between gods and humans.
22. The dialogue ends in *aporia*—the definition circles back to being "what is dear to the gods."
23. Socrates insists on a definition that captures the essential form (*eidos*) of piety.
24. Euthyphro is prosecuting his own father for the murder of a servant.
25. Euthyphro claims expert knowledge of divine matters.
26. Socrates is on his way to his own trial for impiety.
27. The dialogue contrasts Socratic ignorance with Euthyphro's dogmatic confidence.
28. True piety requires intellectual humility and a search for rational understanding.
29. An action cannot be pious simply because the gods command it; they command it because it is good.
30. Piety must be grounded in a moral reality independent of divine will.
31. The dialogue challenges traditional Greek religion based on capricious, quarreling gods.
32. It seeks a philosophical, rational foundation for religious duty.
33. Piety is intimately connected to justice, but its specific difference remains unclear.
34. Euthyphro's dogmatism is presented as a danger greater than Socrates' supposed impiety.
35. The failure to define piety highlights the difficulty of understanding virtue.
36. Socrates implies that his own philosophical mission—cross-examining in service of truth—is a pious act.
37. The dialogue demonstrates the Socratic method of definition and refutation.
38. A proper definition must be universal, essential, and non-circular.
39. Euthyphro's prosecution of his father may be legally correct but philosophically ungrounded.
40. The setting—the porch of the king-archon—frames the discussion as a prelude to Socrates' trial.
41. The tension between traditional familial duty and abstract justice is dramatized.
42. Piety cannot be merely a subset of justice if its object (the gods) cannot be benefited.
43. The "Euthyphro Dilemma" establishes a foundational problem for theological ethics.
44. The gods love the pious for its inherent nature; morality is not created by divine decree.
45. The search for definition is more pious than acting on unexamined conviction.
46. Euthyphro's failure to teach Socrates reveals the emptiness of his claimed expertise.
47. Socrates ironically treats Euthyphro as a teacher, exposing his ignorance.
48. The dialogue suggests that true piety involves caring for the soul through philosophical examination.
49. The inconclusive end leaves the reader to continue the inquiry.
50. The dramatic irony: Socrates, on trial for impiety, seeks a true definition, while Euthyphro, confident in his piety, cannot provide one.

POSITION STATEMENT FOR Ion

**Position Statements from Plato's *Ion***

1. The dialogue's central question is: What is the source and nature of poetic/rhapsodic expertise?
2. Ion is a master rhapsode, specializing solely in Homer.
3. He cannot explain subjects within Homer (e.g., chariot-driving, medicine, generalship) as well as the relevant experts.
4. Therefore, his knowledge is not a technical expertise (*technē*) of Homer's content.
5. A rhapsode's skill is not derived from knowledge (*epistēmē*) or mastery of a craft.
6. Ion is moved powerfully by Homer's poetry during performance.
7. He also powerfully moves his audience.
8. This power is explained as divine inspiration (*theia moira*).
9. The poet is not in his right mind when composing; he is possessed by a god (e.g., the Muse).
10. The rhapsode is a "divinely possessed" interpreter of the divinely possessed poet.
11. The chain of inspiration: God → Muse → Poet → Rhapsode → Audience.
12. Like a magnetic ring, the god transmits power through this chain.
13. The rhapsode is a "light and winged" thing, sacred.
14. He does not speak through art (*technē*) but through divine possession (*enthousiasmos*).
15. A rhapsode can only perform brilliantly on the poet by whom he is inspired (for Ion, Homer).
16. Ion is unable to speak well about other poets (e.g., Hesiod).
17. This selective ability is proof his skill is inspiration, not a universal expertise in poetry.
18. If it were an art, he could speak equally well about all poets on the same subjects.
19. Ion claims to be the best general in Greece based on Homer's descriptions of warfare.
20. Socrates argues that if Ion were truly a general, he would have been hired as one.
21. Ion is either deceptive about his general's knowledge or divinely inspired and not in control.
22. Socrates offers a choice: Ion is either unjust (for claiming unpaid expertise) or divine.
23. Ion gladly accepts the divine, inspired identity.
24. The dialogue criticizes the cultural authority of rhapsodes who claim deep wisdom.
25. It separates inspired performance from genuine knowledge.
26. Poetry and its performance belong to the realm of divine madness, not rational understanding.
27. The rhapsode is an empty vessel, not a true teacher.
28. The audience is the last link in the magnetic chain, also passively enchanted.
29. True expertise (*technē*) is systematic, teachable, and covers a defined subject area.
30. Rhapsody lacks these features and is therefore not a *technē*.
31. The dialogue is deeply ironic: Socrates "praises" Ion as divine while undermining his claims to knowledge.
32. Ion is shown to be charming but intellectually shallow.
33. The dialogue questions the educational value of Homeric poetry.
34. It implies that artistic success is non-rational and non-cognitive.
35. The performer does not understand the true meaning or value of what he performs.
36. The power of poetry lies in emotional contagion, not instruction.
37. Socrates' method exposes the inconsistency in Ion's claims to expertise.
38. Ion is unable to give an account (*logos*) of his art.
39. The dialogue defends a psychological theory of artistic transmission as irrational possession.
40. It presents a challenge: if art is not a *technē*, can it be a source of truth or virtue?
41. The performer is a medium, not an author.
42. The gods use poets and rhapsodes as mouthpieces to communicate with humans.
43. Inspiration is a temporary state, not a permanent condition of wisdom.
44. The dialogue blurs the line between praise and critique.
45. Ion is ultimately a figure of amusement, not malice.
46. The discussion highlights the conflict between traditional cultural authority (Homer) and Socratic philosophy.
47. Art's power is acknowledged but relegated to a non-rational, non-philosophical domain.
48. The philosopher seeks knowledge; the rhapsode transmits divine madness.
49. Ion's specialization in Homer alone is presented as a logical flaw, not a strength.
50. The dialogue ends inconclusively but with Ion "defeated" and choosing the flattering explanation (divinity) over the rational one (lack of expertise).

POSITION STATEMENT FOR Protagoras

**Position Statements from Plato's *Protagoras***

1. The dialogue's central question: Can virtue (*aretē*) be taught?
2. Protagoras claims to teach the political art and make men good citizens.
3. Socrates doubts virtue is teachable, noting that Athenian assemblies do not consult experts on virtue, and good men often fail to teach it to their sons.
4. Protagoras offers a myth: Zeus gave justice (*dikē*) and shame (*aidōs*) to all humans to enable political community.
5. Therefore, political virtue is universal and teachable to all.
6. Virtue is taught by all through punishment, praise, blame, and lifelong socialization.
7. Protagoras presents himself as a superior teacher, like a specialist versus a general practitioner.
8. Virtue is not one thing but many distinct parts (courage, wisdom, piety, justice, temperance).
9. Socrates questions whether the virtues are separate or one unified whole.
10. Through examination, Socrates argues the virtues are essentially one: knowledge.
11. No one willingly does evil; all wrongdoing is due to ignorance (the unity of virtue thesis).
12. The dialogue shifts to exegesis of a poem by Simonides to debate consistency in ethical statements.
13. This literary interlude illustrates the difficulty of interpreting texts and the need for dialectical clarity.
14. The final argument examines courage and wisdom.
15. Courage is knowledge of what is and is not to be feared.
16. Therefore, courage is a form of wisdom.
17. If virtue is knowledge, then it must be teachable.
18. This conclusion contradicts Socrates' initial position and Protagoras' discrete-virtue position.
19. The dialogue ends in apparent role reversal: Socrates arguing virtue is teachable, Protagoras doubtful.
20. The overall conclusion is *aporia*—confusion remains on how virtue is acquired.
21. The setting is the house of Callias, filled with sophists and intellectuals.
22. Protagoras practices and teaches the art of persuasive speaking (*logos*).
23. Socrates brings young Hippocrates, eager to become Protagoras' student.
24. Socrates insists on examining what a sophist teaches before committing.
25. The method of dialogue shifts between long speeches (Protagoras) and short questions (Socrates).
26. Socrates forces the conversation into dialectical form.
27. Pleasure and pain are analyzed: the good is pleasure, the bad is pain.
28. The art of measurement would be a knowledge that overcomes the power of appearance for correct choice.
29. Being overcome by pleasure is actually ignorance of measurement.
30. The many believe in being overcome by pleasure, which Socrates calls impossible if one knows the greater good.
31. All virtues reduce to a hedonic calculus—knowledge of maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain.
32. This hedonistic premise is assumed for argument, not necessarily endorsed by Plato.
33. The sophist is a seller of goods for the soul, but the buyer must beware.
34. The dialogue explores the relationship between nature (*physis*) and custom/nom (*nomos*).
35. Protagoras' myth suggests virtue is conventional but universally instilled.
36. Socrates pushes for a natural, knowledge-based foundation for virtue.
37. The characters embody competing educational models: sophistry vs. philosophy.
38. Prodicus makes a cameo, distinguishing synonyms—a parody of sophistic verbal precision.
39. Hippias advocates natural law, contrasting with conventional justice.
40. The dramatic frame shows Socrates as a protector of the young from unexamined teachings.
41. The dialogue criticizes the sophists' fee-taking and professionalization of virtue.
42. It questions whether virtue, if teachable, should be a specialized skill.
43. Protagoras admits shame and justice are universal, but courage and wisdom may be rarer.
44. Socrates' method demonstrates that philosophical dialogue is the true education.
45. The unity of virtues implies one cannot possess one without the others.
46. The hedonistic calculus makes virtue a technical, teachable science.
47. The final *aporia* suggests the question of teachability remains open, pending a definition of virtue itself.
48. The dialogue is a performance of philosophy outperforming sophistry in its own space.
49. Socrates leaves unsure whether virtue is teachable but certain the sophists do not teach it.
50. The search for virtue is a collaborative, dialectical pursuit, not a commodity to be sold.

POSITION STATEMENT FOR Euthydemus

**Position Statements from Plato's *Euthydemus***

1. The dialogue contrasts true philosophy with eristic sophistry (verbal combat for victory, not truth).
2. Euthydemus and Dionysodorus are brothers, masters of eristic and combat arts.
3. They claim to teach virtue and wisdom better and faster than anyone.
4. Their method is to trap interlocutors in verbal contradictions using fallacies and equivocation.
5. Example: Learning requires either knowing (no need) or not knowing (cannot seek what you don't know) – therefore learning is impossible.
6. Example: To lie is to say what is not; saying what is not is to say nothing; therefore, no one can lie.
7. Socrates labels their arguments "deceptions" and "verbal tripping."
8. True philosophical inquiry aims at caring for the soul and pursuing wisdom.
9. The dialogue includes a model "protreptic" (hortatory) speech by Socrates on why one must pursue wisdom.
10. All men desire happiness (*eudaimonia*).
11. Happiness is acquired by possessing good things (e.g., wealth, health, beauty, virtues).
12. But good things only benefit us if we have the wisdom to use them rightly.
13. Without wisdom, good things can bring greater harm (e.g., wealth without wisdom).
14. Therefore, wisdom is the only unconditional good; it is the necessary condition for benefit.
15. We must then seek wisdom and philosophy above all.
16. But what *is* wisdom? It is the knowledge that benefits us.
17. What knowledge is that? The kingly or political art – the knowledge of ruling.
18. But ruling over what? Over other men to make them better.
19. And what is the product of this art? It must make men wise and good.
20. The argument circles: wisdom makes men good, but we seek wisdom to become good. The precise knowledge remains undefined.
21. Socrates’ protreptic also ends in *aporia*, but constructively, directing toward further inquiry.
22. The young Cleinias is the primary target of both the eristics' traps and Socrates' encouragement.
23. Socrates distinguishes between the eristics' destructive wordplay and his own constructive, if incomplete, exhortation.
24. Eristic refutation aims to humiliate and confuse; Socratic refutation aims to stimulate self-awareness and desire for truth.
25. The dialogue is framed as Socrates recounting the event to his friend Crito, who is concerned about bad reputations for philosophy.
26. Crito reports a bystander’s criticism that philosophy is useless word-chopping.
27. Socrates identifies this critic as a mediocre writer of speeches, representing the practical world's contempt for philosophy.
28. The true philosopher must ignore such ignorant critiques.
29. The brothers’ arguments parody Eleatic and Sophistic paradoxes (e.g., of becoming, of falsehood).
30. Their technique exposes the need for precise definitions and logical consistency in real philosophy.
31. The dramatic action is slapstick, portraying the eristics as ridiculous and aggressive.
32. Socrates plays along ironically, praising their "wonderful wisdom."
33. A serious sub-question: Is knowledge of virtue sufficient for happiness, or is an additional "knowledge of use" required?
34. Socrates suggests wisdom is both the possession of knowledge and its correct application for the good.
35. The dialogue examines the relationship between wisdom, good fortune (*eutychia*), and happiness.
36. Wisdom is identified as the only true good fortune.
37. The eristics represent the danger of philosophy degenerating into empty, amoral logic-chopping.
38. Socrates represents philosophy as a moral and existential pursuit.
39. The setting is the Lyceum, a public space of learning and contest.
40. Ctesippus, Cleinias’ lover, adopts eristic tactics angrily to defend him, showing the method’s corrupting influence.
41. The dialogue is a defense of Socratic philosophy against both hostile caricature and its degenerate imitation.
42. It demonstrates that philosophical inquiry, even when inconclusive, is noble, while verbal victory is trivial.
43. True education requires care for the soul’s orientation toward the good, not just argumentative skill.
44. The brothers are comically portrayed as having all knowledge, even of crafts like cobbling, by their logic.
45. They claim to teach virtue instantly, while Socrates claims to know nothing and teaches slowly.
46. The search for wisdom is a lifelong, cooperative endeavor.
47. The final message to Crito: do not judge philosophy by its corrupt imitators.
48. The philosopher must engage the world to improve it, not just refute it.
49. Eristic treats language as a weapon; philosophy treats language as a tool for shared discovery.
50. The dialogue’s structure (serious protreptic surrounded by farcical eristic) enacts its thesis: the pursuit of wisdom is noble, difficult, and easily mocked, but essential for a good life.

POSITION STATEMENT FOR Gorgias

**Position Statements from Plato's *Gorgias***

1. The dialogue's central conflict: Philosophy vs. Rhetoric.
2. Gorgias defines rhetoric as the art of persuasion concerning justice and injustice in public assemblies.
3. Rhetoric's power (*dynamis*) produces conviction (*pistis*) but not knowledge (*epistēmē*) about its subject.
4. Gorgias claims rhetoric is the greatest good, as it secures freedom and political power.
5. Socrates argues rhetoric is a knack (*empeiria*) for producing gratification and pleasure (*charis*), not a true art (*technē*).
6. It is a form of flattery (*kolakeia*), akin to cookery (which flatters medicine) or cosmetics (which flatters gymnastics).
7. True arts (like medicine) aim at the good of the soul or body; flattery aims at pleasure without regard for the good.
8. Polus enters, defending rhetoric's power to do as one pleases, including injustice without punishment.
9. Socrates argues it is worse to commit injustice than to suffer it.
10. The tyrant, doing great injustice, is the most miserable of men.
11. To do wrong and escape punishment is the greatest evil, as the unpunished soul remains corrupted.
12. Suffering wrong is a lesser evil than doing wrong.
13. Rhetoric's true just use is to accuse oneself and one's loved ones of injustice to ensure they receive curative punishment.
14. Callicles enters, advocating a "natural justice" where the strong rule and satisfy their desires.
15. Convention (*nomos*) is the invention of the weak to restrain the strong.
16. The superior man (*kreittōn*) should allow his desires to grow as large as possible and use courage and intelligence to satisfy them.
17. Philosophy, in Callicles' view, is useless and disgraceful for an adult in public life.
18. Socrates argues the life of limitless desire is like a leaky jar, never satisfied; it is the life of a tyrant, not a happy man.
19. Order and discipline (*kosmos*) are the principles of a good soul, analogous to health in the body.
20. The temperate (*sōphrōn*) man, master of himself, is the good and happy man.
21. The many, whom Callicles says he follows, actually believe in orderly, lawful happiness, not limitless license.
22. The craftsman imposes order; so the good soul is ordered by law and justice.
23. Pleasure is not the good; some pleasures are bad (e.g., the coward's pleasure at escaping battle).
24. Good things (like health, wisdom, courage) are good because of their structure (*taxis*) and order (*kosmos*).
25. The final myth: Naked souls are judged after death by truly just judges. The incurable are eternally punished as warnings; the curable are purified. The philosophical soul, ordered and just, goes to the Isles of the Blessed.
26. The dialogue is a call to care for the justice of one's soul above all political or rhetorical success.
27. Socrates alone practices the true political art, aiming at the citizens' improvement.
28. Athenian politicians (Pericles, Cimon, Themistocles) are criticized for flattering, not improving, the people.
29. Rhetoric, as practiced, is a tool for self-advancement, not public good.
30. The philosopher is the true statesman.
31. It is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong.
32. It is better to be justly punished than to escape punishment for injustice.
33. The unexamined power (like tyranny) is the greatest curse.
34. The goal of life is not pleasure, but the goodness and order of the soul.
35. Callicles' ideal of the strong man is, in reality, a slave to his own unlimited desires.
36. Shame (*aischynē*) is a natural emotion indicating a violation of true, not conventional, norms.
37. Socrates claims to be one of the few Athenians who attempts the true political art.
38. The dialogue ends with Socrates asserting the coherence of his arguments: the good soul is happy, the unjust soul is miserable.
39. The myth serves as a cosmological reinforcement of the logical argument.
40. Philosophy requires a radical reorientation of values away from power, wealth, and fame toward justice and wisdom.
41. Gorgias is trapped by his own admission that a rhetorician must teach justice or else risk being unjust through ignorance.
42. Polus is trapped by his agreement that doing wrong is more shameful (*aischion*) than suffering it, linking shame to objective badness.
43. Callicles is forced to concede that some pleasures are better than others, introducing a standard beyond pleasure itself.
44. The "geometric equality" of the soul and cosmos is the true standard of justice.
45. Socrates presents himself as a doctor of the soul, offering bitter medicine.
46. The dialogue is a defense of Socratic ethics against three progressively more hostile and radical opponents.
47. Rhetoric is a phantom (*eidōlon*) of a part of politics (the judicial part).
48. True art requires knowledge of the nature and cause of its subject.
49. The rhetorician, like the pastry chef, has no knowledge of the soul's good.
50. The final, urgent conclusion: One must choose the life of philosophy and justice, regardless of worldly poverty or mockery, for the sake of one's eternal soul. 
POSITION STATEMENT FOR  HIPPIAS MINOR**
1. The dialogue examines the proposition: Is the truthful person or the false person more capable?
2. It begins with Achilles being praised as truthful and Odysseus as false and wily.
3. Socrates argues the false person is one who is able to be false.
4. To be able to be false is to possess knowledge and power.
5. The truthful person is also the one who is able to be truthful.
6. Therefore, the same person is able to be both false and truthful.
7. The good person is the one who voluntarily does wrong, because they have the power to do so.
8. The bad person does wrong involuntarily, due to lack of power and knowledge.
9. This leads to the counter-intuitive conclusion: the one who does wrong voluntarily is better than the one who does it involuntarily.
10. The dialogue ends in aporia, disturbed by this outcome.

**HIPPIAS MAJOR**
1. The central question: What is the beautiful (*to kalon*)?
2. Hippias first defines the beautiful as a beautiful maiden.
3. Socrates refutes this: the beautiful must be that which makes all beautiful things beautiful.
4. Hippias' second definition: the beautiful is gold.
5. Refuted: Gold is not beautiful in inappropriate contexts (e.g., a wooden soup ladle).
6. Hippias' third definition: to be rich, healthy, and honored, and to bury one's parents well.
7. Refuted: This is not a single form (*eidos*) but a list.
8. Socrates offers a definition from "the other": the beautiful is the appropriate (*prepon*).
9. Problem: The appropriate makes things appear beautiful, not necessarily be beautiful.
10. Another definition: the beautiful is the useful (*chrēsimon*).
11. Problem: The useful is for some good effect; thus the beautiful becomes the cause of good.
12. But a cause is different from its effect, so the beautiful is not the good.
13. Another definition: the beautiful is the beneficial (*ōphelimon*) through hearing and sight.
14. This narrows the beautiful to pleasures of sight and hearing.
15. Problem: Why unite these two distinct pleasures under one form?
16. The final definition attempted: the beautiful is the pleasurable (*hēdy*) through sight and hearing.
17. This is also found insufficient, as it does not capture the essence.
18. The dialogue ends in aporia; the definition remains elusive.
19. Hippias is portrayed as a self-satisfied polymath unable to grasp philosophical definition.
20. Socrates insists on seeking a unitary form that explains all instances.

**MENO**
1. The dialogue's opening question: Can virtue (*aretē*) be taught?
2. Meno defines virtue: virtue of a man (managing the city), of a woman (managing the household), etc.
3. Socrates rejects this as a "swarm" of virtues; he seeks the single form of virtue.
4. Meno's second definition: virtue is the ability to rule over people.
5. Refuted: This is not virtuous without justice.
6. Meno's third definition: virtue is to desire fine things and have the power to acquire them.
7. Refuted: One must desire good things; no one desires evil knowingly.
8. Meno presents his paradox: One cannot search for what one knows (no need) or for what one does not know (won't recognize it).
9. Socrates responds with the theory of recollection (*anamnēsis*): the soul is immortal and has learned all things.
10. Learning is recollection of knowledge from past lives.
11. Socrates demonstrates this by guiding a slave boy to geometrical truth through questioning.
12. The boy recollects, he is not taught.
13. If virtue is knowledge, it can be taught.
14. Socrates and Meno agree to investigate whether virtue is knowledge.
15. They agree virtue is something good and beneficial.
16. All good things depend on right use, guided by wisdom.
17. Therefore, virtue is a kind of wisdom (knowledge).
18. If virtue is knowledge, it should be teachable.
19. But there are no teachers of virtue (Sophists claim to be, but are unreliable; good men like Themistocles failed to teach it to their sons).
20. Therefore, virtue may not be knowledge, but true opinion (*alēthēs doxa*).
21. True opinion is as good as knowledge for practical guidance.
22. True opinion is unstable, however; it can "run away" unless tied down by reasoning (*aitias logismos*).
23. Virtue thus comes by divine dispensation (*theia moira*) without understanding, like poetic inspiration.
24. The dialogue ends inconclusively on teachability but affirms the method of inquiry via recollection.
25. The search for definition is possible and necessary, despite the paradox.


**HIPPIAS MINOR (Additional 25)**
26. The dialogue explores the relationship between ability (*dynamis*), knowledge, and moral intention.
27. The person with knowledge is capable of both truth and falsehood in their domain.
28. The ignorant person is incapable of being truly false in a skilled way; they merely make mistakes.
29. Voluntary wrongdoing implies a full understanding of the right and the wrong.
30. Involuntary wrongdoing stems from ignorance and lack of control.
31. The argument challenges the Greek heroic ideal that links nobility (*kalokagathia*) with simple honesty.
32. It problematizes the moral status of technical skill or cleverness (*deinotēs*).
33. There is an implicit critique of Hippias as a polymath who possesses many skills but lacks self-knowledge.
34. The logical conclusion is at odds with Socratic ethics, suggesting the dialogue may be elenchic and aporetic, not doctrinal.
35. Socrates may be arguing ad hominem to reveal inconsistencies in Hippias’s views of Homeric heroes.
36. The voluntary wrongdoer, by knowing what is right, is closer to being good than the ignorant wrongdoer.
37. The discussion blurs the line between intellectual capacity and moral virtue.
38. It raises the question: Does knowledge of good and evil necessarily lead to doing good?
39. The dialogue unsettles the straightforward association of goodness with simplicity and badness with complexity.
40. It serves as a logical exercise on the predicates of ability and voluntariness.
41. Hippias is confident in his interpretations of Homer and his own moral character.
42. Socrates adopts an ironic stance, praising Hippias while leading him into contradiction.
43. The form of the dialogue is a duel of wits more than a cooperative search.
44. The true and false person are shown to be the same in capacity, different only in intention or use of that capacity.
45. But intention (*prohairesis*) is not sufficiently examined, leaving the moral psychology incomplete.
46. The analogy is drawn to other arts: the good runner is the one who can run fast *and* slow; the good doctor can kill and cure.
47. Power is morally neutral; its goodness depends on the wisdom and justice of its use.
48. The argument suggests that ultimate moral knowledge would confer the power to choose either good or evil actions.
49. This presents a paradox for the Socratic thesis that knowledge is virtue and that no one errs willingly.
50. The dialogue ends with Socrates dissatisfied, preferring to be the involuntary wrongdoer if the conclusion is true, thus distancing himself from the argument’s outcome.

**HIPPIAS MAJOR (Additional 25)**
26. The dialogue is a search for a definition of the Beautiful (*to kalon*) itself, not examples.
27. The beautiful maiden is beautiful only in relation to an ape, but ugly in relation to a goddess.
28. Therefore, any particular thing can be both beautiful and ugly; the Form cannot.
29. Gold is beautiful only when it is fitting (*harmotton*); the fitting becomes a new candidate.
30. The appropriate (*prepon*) makes things appear beautiful, which separates appearance from being.
31. The useful (*chrēsimon*) is beautiful only when it is actually used for good; potential is not enough.
32. The cause of good (*tou agathou aition*) is different from the good itself, so the beautiful cannot simply be the good.
33. The beneficial (*ōphelimon*) is a subset of the useful—what actually brings about good.
34. The pleasurable through sight and hearing is a hedonistic definition, reducing beauty to a subjective experience.
35. Why sight and hearing? Because they are the senses through which we perceive order, harmony, and rhythm.
36. But pleasures of taste, touch, and smell are excluded, suggesting a hierarchy of senses.
37. The definition fails because "pleasurable through sight and hearing" is a contingent attribute, not an essence.
38. Hippias represents the sophistic reliance on examples, reputation, and practical success.
39. Socrates represents the philosophical insistence on a unitary, intelligible standard.
40. The dialogue parodies Hippias’s boastful self-presentation as a universal expert.
41. The "other" Socrates speaks of is likely his own critical, philosophical self.
42. The appropriate is rejected because it deals with semblance, not reality.
43. The dialogue implies the Beautiful may be related to measure, proportion, or order—but never states it.
44. The failure to define mirrors the difficulty of capturing a transcendental Form in language.
45. The method is one of hypothesis and refutation, not positive doctrine.
46. Beauty is treated as an objective quality, not a matter of convention.
47. The discussion has implications for art, morality, and love.
48. Socrates feigns being instructed by Hippias, exposing the latter’s emptiness.
49. The true lesson is the recognition of ignorance as the starting point for wisdom.
50. The pursuit of the definition, though unsuccessful, is itself a beautiful activity of the soul.

**MENO (Additional 25)**
26. The theory of recollection solves the epistemological paradox of inquiry.
27. The soul, being immortal, has seen all things, so learning is remembering.
28. The slave boy demonstration shows innate geometrical knowledge elicited through questioning.
29. The boy starts with a false belief about doubling a square’s area.
30. Through *elenchus*, he recognizes his error and experiences puzzlement (*aporia*).
31. From aporia, Socrates guides him to recover the correct answer from within.
32. The boy’s knowledge is latent; he has not been taught the answer.
33. This proves the soul’s prenatal knowledge and the possibility of learning.
34. All nature is akin, so recalling one thing can lead to the discovery of everything.
35. If virtue is knowledge, it too can be recollected and taught.
36. The search for whether virtue is teachable is an empirical one: find teachers and students.
37. Anytus enters, representing Athenian conventional morality and hostility to Sophists.
38. Anytus warns that Sophists corrupt the youth; good citizens learn virtue from previous good citizens.
39. But Socrates points out that great Athenians (Themistocles, Pericles) failed to teach virtue to their sons.
40. Therefore, either they did not have knowledge (virtue) to teach, or it is not teachable.
41. The absence of recognized masters of virtue is a strong argument against its teachability.
42. Virtue may come by divine gift (*theia moira*) without intelligence, like prophecy.
43. True opinion (*alēthēs doxa*) is distinguished from knowledge (*epistēmē*).
44. True opinion is as good a guide to right action as knowledge.
45. But true opinion is unstable; it can be forgotten or lost unless fixed by causal reasoning.
46. Knowledge is stable because it is tied down by understanding of the cause (*aitia*).
47. Virtuous men, then, may be like inspired seers: they have correct opinions, not knowledge.
48. This explains their inability to teach it to others.
49. The dialogue suggests a hierarchy: divine gift/true opinion < knowledge (which is teachable).
50. The conclusion is modest: virtue is not knowledge, but a kind of true opinion given by the gods, and its essence remains undefined, though the method of inquiry (recollection) is validated.



Here are 25 position statements for each of the remaining requested Platonic dialogues.

**PHAEDO**
1. The soul is immortal.
2. The philosopher practices dying and being dead throughout life.
3. The body is an impediment to true knowledge.
4. The senses deceive; pure truth is grasped by the intellect alone.
5. The Theory of Forms: Absolute realities (e.g., Equality, Beauty, Good) exist separately from their imperfect instances.
6. Knowledge is recollection (*anamnesis*) of the Forms seen by the soul before birth.
7. The soul is most like the divine, immortal, intelligible, and uniform.
8. The body is most like the human, mortal, perceptible, and composite.
9. The "Affinity Argument": The soul is akin to the unchanging Forms, therefore it is unchanging and indestructible.
10. The soul is the principle of life; it cannot admit its opposite, death, and is therefore deathless.
11. The Cyclical Argument: Life comes from death and death from life in an endless cycle.
12. The soul exists before birth to account for our knowledge of the Forms.
13. Socrates' final hours are a demonstration of the philosophical life's serenity in the face of death.
14. The philosopher despises bodily pleasures like food, drink, and sex.
15. Suicide is forbidden because we are the possessions of the gods.
16. The final argument: The soul is the Form of Life; it cannot be present in a body without bringing life; therefore, it cannot admit death.
17. The Myth of the True Earth: A cosmological allegory of the soul’s journey after death.
18. The soul is subject to reincarnation based on its purity and philosophical attainment.
19. Misology (hatred of argument) is a danger greater than death.
20. The Forms are causes of things being what they are (the Safe but Simple explanation).
21. Socrates’ intellectual autobiography: He sought physical and then teleological causes, finding safety in the Forms.
22. The Method of Hypothesis: Assume the truth of a higher principle (like the Forms) and test its consequences.
23. True virtue comes from wisdom and philosophy; popular virtue is a shadow of it.
24. The final proof aims to demonstrate the soul is not only deathless but also imperishable.
25. The dialogue is a dramatization of the triumph of reasoned faith over the fear of annihilation.

**SYMPOSIUM**
1. Love (*Eros*) is a desire for what one lacks.
2. Love is not a god, but a *daimon*, an intermediary between mortal and immortal.
3. Love’s object is the beautiful (*to kalon*).
4. Love’s ultimate aim is permanent possession of the good, which for mortals means immortality.
5. Humans seek immortality through physical offspring or the “spiritual offspring” of fame and creative works.
6. Diotima’s Ladder of Love: Ascent from love of a single beautiful body, to all beautiful bodies, to beautiful souls, laws, and knowledge, finally to the Form of Beauty itself.
7. The Form of Beauty is eternal, absolute, not relative, and the source of all beautiful things.
8. The vision of the Form of Beauty is the only life worth living.
9. Alcibiades’ speech disrupts the theory, showing Socrates as the embodiment of the philosophical lover.
10. Socrates claims to know nothing except the art of love (*ta erotika*).
11. The speeches before Socrates represent incomplete understandings of love.
12. Phaedrus: Love inspires virtue and courage.
13. Pausanias: Distinguishes Common Love (of the body) from Heavenly Love (of the soul and character).
14. Eryximachus: Love is a cosmic force of harmony and balance in all things.
15. Aristophanes: Love is the desire for our original, severed halves; a quest for wholeness.
16. Agathon: Love is a young, beautiful, and tender god, the source of all virtues.
17. Socrates refutes Agathon: Love cannot be beautiful if it desires beauty.
18. The true lover is a philosopher, in a state between wisdom and ignorance.
19. Love’s creative power is the longing to give birth “in beauty,” physically or spiritually.
20. The highest creativity is the engendering of true virtue and wisdom in another soul.
21. Alcibiades’ failed attempt to seduce Socrates demonstrates Socrates’ mastery over bodily desires.
22. Socrates is the exemplar of the ascent, having moved from physical beauty to the beauty of the soul.
23. The dialogue links love, creativity, and the pursuit of the transcendent good.
24. The setting—a drinking party with suspended rules—mirrors the theme of transcending limits.
25. The conclusion is ambiguous, with Socrates forcing the poets to agree the same man could write comedy and tragedy, hinting at the unity of the human experience.

**REPUBLIC**
1. Justice (*dikaiosynē*) is the health, harmony, and proper order of the soul.
2. The just city is an analogy for the just soul: three classes correspond to three parts of the soul.
3. The soul has three parts: Rational (seeks truth, rules), Spirited (seeks honor, defends), Appetitive (seeks pleasure, obeys).
4. Justice in the soul is each part performing its proper function under the rule of reason.
5. The city has three classes: Rulers (Philosopher-Kings, rational), Auxiliaries (Guardians, spirited), Producers (farmers/artisans, appetitive).
6. The Philosopher-Kings must rule because only they have knowledge of the Good.
7. The Form of the Good is the ultimate object of knowledge, the source of all truth and reality.
8. The Allegory of the Cave: Most humans live in ignorance, mistaking shadows for reality; education is the painful turn toward the light of truth.
9. The Divided Line: Illustrates levels of cognition: Imagination (images), Belief (physical things), Thought (mathematical objects), Understanding (Forms).
10. Education is not putting knowledge into souls, but turning the soul’s eye toward the Good.
11. The Noble Lie: The Myth of the Metals (gold, silver, bronze/iron) to foster social harmony.
12. Women are equally eligible to be Guardians, based on nature, not convention.
13. The family and private property are abolished among the Guardians to eliminate factional loyalty.
14. Art (poetry, music) must be censored to educate the character, as it powerfully imitates and shapes the soul.
15. Poetry is an imitation (*mimesis*) of an imitation (the physical world, which imitates Forms), thus thrice removed from truth.
16. The soul is immortal and endures many reincarnations (Myth of Er).
17. The tyrant is the most unjust and miserable man, ruled by lawless, mad desires.
18. Injustice is a tyranny of one part of the soul over the others, creating internal strife and misery.
19. The just life is happier than the unjust life, regardless of external rewards.
20. There are four unjust constitutions, descending from the just: Timocracy, Oligarchy, Democracy, Tyranny.
21. Each constitution mirrors a type of soul dominated by a different part (honor-loving, money-loving, freedom-loving, lust-loving).
22. Knowledge is of what is (Being), ignorance of what is not (Non-being), opinion is of what lies between (the sensible world).
23. Philosophers must be compelled to return to the Cave to rule, as a debt to the city that educated them.
24. The Theory of Forms is necessary to ground knowledge, morality, and political authority.
25. The dialogue is a search for the meaning of justice and the defense that the just life is intrinsically superior, even in the face of Glaucon’s challenge of the perfectly unjust man seeming just.

**CRATYLUS**
1. The dialogue investigates whether names are natural (*physei*) or conventional (*thesei*).
2. Cratylus argues names are natural: a correct name reveals the essence of the thing named.
3. Hermogenes argues names are conventional: any name agreed upon is correct.
4. Socrates mediates, proposing a craftsman (nomothete) who imposes names according to the nature of the thing.
5. A name is a tool (*organon*) for instructing and separating reality.
6. The name-giver must know the reality he names to fashion a correct name.
7. Etymology is used to show how primordial name-givers embedded truths about reality in words.
8. But etymologies are often fanciful and contradictory, suggesting instability in language.
9. The primary names (phonemes) imitate the essence of things through sound (e.g., 'r' for motion).
10. If names are imitations, they are inferior to the things they imitate.
11. One cannot learn about reality solely from names, as names can be poorly made.
12. One must learn from the things themselves, not their names.
13. Cratylus takes the naturalist view to an extreme: knowing the name is knowing the thing.
14. Socrates refutes this: If names can be wrongly applied, they are not infallible guides.
15. There must be a standard beyond names to judge their correctness—the Forms.
16. The first names may have been given by a legislator with a flawed view of reality (Heraclitean flux).
17. If all is in flux, stable knowledge through names is impossible.
18. Knowledge must be of stable, unchanging realities (Forms), apprehended directly, not through names.
19. Language is a useful but flawed medium for philosophy.
20. The dialogue ends with Socrates advocating for studying things themselves, not words.
21. Hermogenes’ conventionalism is also rejected, as it makes truth relative.
22. The etymological exercise is both a serious philosophical inquiry and a parody of sophistic word-play.
23. The dialogue critiques the Heraclitean doctrine of universal flux.
24. It affirms the need for objective, non-linguistic standards for truth.
25. The final position: Language points toward reality but is not its master; the philosopher must look beyond it.

**PHAEDRUS**
1. True rhetoric must be based on knowledge of the truth and knowledge of the soul.
2. The soul is immortal and self-moving, the source of all motion.
3. The soul is likened to a charioteer (Reason) with two horses (Spirit and Appetite).
4. Souls follow the gods in a procession to behold the plain of Truth (the Forms).
5. Human souls glimpse the Forms imperfectly; the fall to earth and incarnation is a result of failing to maintain the vision.
6. Love (*eros*) is a divine madness (*mania*) sent by the gods, the greatest of blessings.
7. The lover sees in the beloved a reflection of the Form of Beauty, which triggers recollection.
8. The philosophical lover uses this madness to ascend from physical beauty to the Form.
9. The non-lover, who is merely calculating, is inferior to the inspired lover.
10. There are four kinds of divine madness: prophetic, ritual, poetic, and erotic.
11. Writing is criticized as a threat to memory and true understanding; it gives the semblance of wisdom.
12. The written word is dead, cannot defend itself, and speaks to all indiscriminately.
13. The living word of dialectic, planted in a suitable soul, is superior.
14. A proper speech (like Lysias’s) should be an organic whole, like a living creature.
15. Rhetoric without philosophy is a mere knack, like cookery.
16. The true art of rhetoric requires classifying types of souls and types of speeches to match them.
17. Dialectic—the processes of collection (*synagogē*) and division (*diairesis*)—is the method for finding truth.
18. Love is a madness that can lead either to vice (if the bad horse dominates) or to philosophical virtue.
19. The cicadas myth suggests one should philosophize, not be lulled by their song of summer.
20. The dialogue’s setting—outside the city walls—symbolizes the move beyond conventional rhetoric.
21. Socrates’ two speeches (the non-lover speech recanted, then the palinode) model philosophical repentance and correction.
22. The beauty of the natural setting inspires Socrates’ best speech, linking beauty to philosophical inspiration.
23. The dialogue unifies themes of love, rhetoric, soul, and the pursuit of transcendent truth.
24. The true lover seeks to help the beloved grow wings and ascend back toward the divine.
25. The final prayer is for inner beauty and harmony, uniting the dialogue’s ethical and aesthetic aims.

**THEAETETUS**
1. The dialogue asks: What is knowledge (*epistēmē*)?
2. It examines and rejects three definitions: a) Knowledge is perception, b) Knowledge is true judgment, c) Knowledge is true judgment with an account (*logos*).
3. First definition: Knowledge is perception (*aisthēsis*). This is identified with Protagoras’s doctrine: “Man is the measure of all things.”
4. If knowledge is perception, then every appearance is true for the perceiver (radical relativism).
5. This leads to absurdities: No one is wiser, no false beliefs are possible, animals are also measures.
6. Protagoras’s doctrine is self-refuting: If all opinions are true, then the opinion that Protagoras is wrong is also true.
7. Perception is of qualities (e.g., hot, white), not of being (*ousia*); knowledge must be of being.
8. The flux doctrine (Heraclitus) underpinning the perception theory makes stable knowledge impossible.
9. The soul judges “being” and sameness/difference through itself, not through the senses.
10. Therefore, knowledge is not perception.
11. Second definition: Knowledge is true judgment (*alēthēs doxa*).
12. But one can have a true judgment by luck (e.g., a jury persuaded by a lawyer, not by knowledge).
13. True judgment lacks the stability and explanatory grounding required for knowledge.
14. The “Wax Block” model: Memory is an imprint on wax; true judgment is a fit between perception and memory imprint.
15. But this fails to account for false judgments of mismatch.
16. The “Aviary” model: Knowledge is possessing pieces of knowledge like birds in a cage; false judgment is catching the wrong bird.
17. But this leads to the problem of knowing and not-knowing the same piece of knowledge.
18. If one possesses knowledge, one cannot mistake it for ignorance; thus false judgment remains unexplained.
19. Therefore, knowledge is not simply true judgment.
20. Third definition: Knowledge is true judgment with an account (*logos*).
21. Three interpretations of “account” are examined: a) Speech (inadequate, as all judgment involves speech), b) Listing the elements (insufficient for knowledge of the whole), c) Stating the differentiating mark.
22. The Dream Theory: Knowledge is true judgment about a complex, which is knowable, based on its unknowable simple elements.
23. This is rejected: One cannot have knowledge of a complex if its elements are unknowable.
24. The dialogue ends in aporia; no satisfactory definition of knowledge is found.
25. Socrates’ role as midwife: He delivers Theaetetus’s ideas and tests them, showing they are stillborn, but Theaetetus is left more capable of future inquiry; the negative result is fruitful.

**PARMENIDES**
1. The dialogue contains a devastating critique of the Theory of Forms as presented by a young Socrates.
2. The critique is presented by Parmenides, who affirms he believes in Forms but points out difficulties.
3. The “Greatest Difficulty”: Forms are separate; how do particulars participate in them? (The Third Man regress).
4. If Forms are paradigms, particulars resemble them, leading to an infinite regress of resemblances.
5. If Forms are separate, we cannot have knowledge of them, as our knowledge is of particulars.
6. Forms might be mere thoughts, existing only in minds, but then they wouldn’t be independent realities.
7. The participation problem: Does a whole Form or a part exist in each particular?
8. Parmenides argues young Socrates posits Forms too hastily, for things like hair, mud, and dirt.
9. The critique is not meant to destroy the Theory but to train Socrates in dialectic.
10. The second part is a dialectical exercise on the hypothesis: “If the One is” and “If the One is not.”
11. This generates eight (or nine) logically deduced deductions about the consequences for the One and the Others.
12. The deductions are often contradictory, showing the complexity of concepts like Unity, Being, and Difference.
13. The exercise demonstrates the method of hypothesis and the necessity of considering all consequences.
14. It trains the mind to handle extreme abstract reasoning, necessary for defending the Theory of Forms.
15. The conclusions are paradoxical: The One seems to have and not have all predicates (motion, rest, likeness, etc.).
16. The purpose is gymnastic, to prepare for a more robust defense of the Forms.
17. The dialogue suggests the Forms may need a more sophisticated metaphysical framework.
18. It highlights the immense difficulty of any coherent account of being and unity.
19. The historical Parmenides critiques the youthful Socratic theory, guiding him toward greater rigor.
20. The exercise shows that negation and hypothesis are essential tools of philosophy.
21. The final deduction suggests that if the One is not, then nothing is or can be spoken of.
22. The dialogue is a watershed in Plato’s thought, marking a self-critical turn in his metaphysics.
23. It implies that the theory of participation (*methexis*) must be clarified.
24. The method of collection and division (from *Phaedrus*) is presupposed as the way forward.
25. The overall message: The Theory of Forms is necessary but must be developed with full logical awareness of its pitfalls; philosophy requires relentless dialectical training.


Here are 25 position statements for each of the final dialogues, including those of disputed authenticity.

**SOPHIST**
1. The Sophist is defined as an imitator who produces false appearances.
2. The central metaphysical problem: How can false statement or belief exist? It requires that "what is not" in some sense *is*.
3. "What is not" does not mean absolute non-being, but Otherness (*heteron*).
4. The Five Greatest Kinds (*megista genē*): Being, Sameness, Difference, Motion, Rest. They interweave.
5. Being (*to on*) is not just motion or rest, but a third thing that partakes of both.
6. Difference pervades all things; each thing is by being different from the others.
7. False statement says "what is not" (the different) as if it were.
8. The Sophist is a maker of semblances in the realm of opinion, not reality.
9. The method of collection and division (*synagogē* and *diairesis*) is used to hunt the definition.
10. The Sophist is finally defined as a producer of ignorant imitations through the art of contradiction in private debate.
11. The dialogue overcomes Parmenides' prohibition against speaking of "what is not."
12. The art of dialectic is the science of discerning the interweaving of the Forms.
13. Images (*eidōla*) are of two kinds: likenesses (*eikones*, accurate copies) and semblances (*phantasmata*, distorted copies).
14. The Sophist deals in semblances.
15. The Eleatic Stranger, not Socrates, leads the inquiry.
16. The philosopher is distinguished from the Sophist: the philosopher seeks truth through reason; the Sophist creates illusion for profit.
17. Non-being is shown to be a Form, the Form of Difference.
18. The dialogue establishes the possibility of meaningful falsehood, essential for logic and epistemology.
19. The final divisions locate the Sophist under the acquisitive, rather than productive, arts.
20. The art of refutation (*elenchus*) is a noble tool of the philosopher, debased by the Sophist.
21. The discussion of Being and Not-Being is a necessary propaedeutic to defining the Sophist.
22. The Sophist hides in the darkness of Not-Being, which the dialogue illuminates.
23. All statements involve a weaving together of Forms (verb and noun) to portray a state of affairs.
24. Falsehood is a mismatch between the statement and the state of affairs that is.
25. The dialogue concludes by saving the phenomenon of falsehood and defining the Sophist as a wizard of words, a mimic of the wise.

**STATESMAN**
1. The Statesman is defined through the method of division.
2. The central metaphor: Statesmanship is the art of weaving.
3. The true ruler rules by wisdom (*epistēmē*), not by law or consent.
4. Law is a blunt instrument, incapable of judging particular circumstances with precision.
5. In the absence of a true statesman, the second-best regime is rule by immutable laws.
6. The myth of the Age of Cronos: A cosmic cycle where the god directly steers the world versus when it is left to its own devices.
7. In our current age (Zeus's), the world moves on its own, requiring human art and governance.
8. The Statesman weaves together opposite character types (courageous and moderate) into a strong civic fabric.
9. The art of measurement is crucial: distinguishing due measure (*to metrion*) from the merely relative.
10. There are three main constitutions: monarchy, aristocracy, democracy, each with a corrupt counterpart (tyranny, oligarchy, lawless democracy).
11. The best is monarchy with knowledge; the worst is tyranny.
12. All law-bound constitutions are imitations of the true rule, with monarchy-by-law being best, democracy-by-law worst.
13. The Eleatic Stranger corrects early divisions: the Statesman is a herdsman of humans, but a special kind—one who cares for voluntary, bipedal creatures.
14. The paradigm of weaving is introduced to correct the overly simplistic herd-tending model.
15. The dialogue identifies "ancillary arts" (like generalship, rhetoric, judiciary) that serve the royal art.
16. The royal art does not *do* these things but directs those who do.
17. The Statesman's knowledge is synoptic, directive, and concerned with the greatest good of the community.
18. The weaver-ruler uses persuasion for the willing, force for the unwilling, to achieve the city's good.
19. The dialogue defends the unpopular thesis that the knowledgeable ruler may act outside the law for the city's benefit.
20. Education is part of the ruler's weaving art, shaping characters to fit together.
21. The myth serves to distinguish divine from human caretaking, emphasizing human responsibility.
22. The method of division must be guided by natural joints, not arbitrary cuts.
23. The example of the angler is a training exercise in division.
24. The final definition: The Statesman possesses the kingly art of caring for the entire human community, weaving together dispositions through right opinion, for the common good.
25. The dialogue culminates in a vision of political expertise as a rational, directive, synthetic craft.

**PHILEBUS**
1. The dialogue's question: Is pleasure (*hēdonē*) or intellect (*nous*) the good for human life?
2. The answer: Neither alone; the good is a mixed life of pleasure and knowledge.
3. The final ranking: Measure (*metron*) and proportion (*symmetron*) are first, followed by the fitting, intellect, sciences/arts, pure pleasures, and finally necessary mixed pleasures.
4. Pleasures are not all alike; there are true and false pleasures.
5. False pleasures exist: those based on false anticipations, or those mistaken in intensity due to contrast.
6. Pure pleasures are those unmixed with pain (e.g., of beautiful colors, shapes, smells, learning).
7. Impure pleasures are releases from pain (e.g., quenching thirst), always mixed with their opposite.
8. Some pleasures are "unlimited" (*apeiron*) and can become excessive and destructive.
9. Intellect (*nous*) is the cause of the mixture, introducing limit (*peras*) to the unlimited.
10. The fourfold ontology: The Unlimited, The Limit, The Mixture of these two, The Cause of the mixture (Intellect).
11. The good life is a harmonious mixture produced by intellect imposing limit on pleasures and pains.
12. The dialectical method is to seek the one in the many and the many in the one.
13. Pleasure alone cannot provide a stable, harmonious existence; it is inherently processual.
14. Wisdom and knowledge are more akin to the good than pleasure is.
15. The dialogue critiques hedonism (represented by Philebus) and extreme intellectualism.
16. The gods enjoy a life of pure intellect, unmixed with pleasure or pain.
17. Memory, anticipation, and desire are key to understanding the psychology of pleasure.
18. The science of dialectic—the highest knowledge—is the truest possession of the mind.
19. The arts are ranked by their use of precision and measurement (e.g., mathematics above music).
20. The cause of the good mixture in the cosmos is a cosmic intellect, akin to divine reason.
21. The final good for humans is a state of being, not a process of becoming.
22. Pleasure is a genesis (process of becoming) toward a being; the good is a state of being (*ousia*).
23. The dialogue provides a sophisticated psychology and metaphysics to support ethical conclusions.
24. Socrates leads the discussion, not the Eleatic Stranger.
25. The conclusion is a hierarchical, rational hedonism where intellect governs and selects pleasures.

**TIMAEUS**
1. The physical world is a living, intelligent creature, crafted by a divine Demiurge.
2. The Demiurge is good and desired all things to be as like himself (good) as possible.
3. He imposed order on pre-existing chaotic motion, using the eternal Forms as models.
4. The World Soul is constructed from a mixture of Same, Different, and Being, and is placed at the center of the cosmos.
5. Time is the moving image of eternity.
6. The stars and planets are divine, visible gods, moved by the World Soul.
7. Human souls are made from the same (less pure) material as the World Soul.
8. The human body is constructed by lesser gods to house the immortal soul.
9. The head is spherical (like the cosmos) to house the rational soul; the chest houses spirit, the belly appetite.
10. Diseases of body and soul arise from imbalance of the four elements or poor regimen.
11. The four elements (fire, air, water, earth) are not primitives but are composed of geometric shapes: regular polyhedra (tetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedron, cube).
12. These shapes are themselves composed of two types of elementary triangles.
13. Perception is explained by physical particles from objects interacting with the body's channels.
14. The Receptacle (*hypodochē*) is the "nurse of becoming," a neutral space that receives the copies of Forms.
15. The Receptacle is characterized by a chaotic, unstable motion before the Demiurge's intervention.
16. The cosmos is unique, because its model (the Living Being containing all Forms) is unique.
17. Necessity (*anankē*) and Reason (*nous*) are the two causes: Reason persuades Necessity for the best.
18. The dialogue is a "likely story" (*eikōs mythos*), not certain truth, due to the nature of the physical world.
19. The purpose of the human rational soul is to contemplate the cosmic order and thereby order itself.
20. Men who live poorly are reincarnated as women or lower animals.
21. Atlantis is introduced as a historical example of a great, ancient Athens that defeated it.
22. Mathematics and astronomy are essential for understanding the divine cosmos and tuning the soul.
23. Vision is a divine gift to allow us to observe the heavens and develop philosophy.
24. The liver is the organ of divination, transmitting images from reason to the appetitive soul during sleep.
25. The dialogue is a comprehensive physical and physiological account grounded in metaphysical principles.

12. Ancient Athens, at the same time, was a virtuous, well-ordered state with a class of guardians.
13. The Athenian guardians had no private property and lived communally.
14. Athens led a Hellenic alliance against the invading Atlantean empire.
15. After a great struggle, Athens alone defeated the Atlantean forces.
16. Subsequently, violent earthquakes and floods caused Atlantis to sink into the sea in a single day and night.
17. The same cataclysm also submerged the Athenian army.
18. The story is presented as a true history, passed down from Solon.
19. The purpose is to show a historical example of the ideal state in action and the divine punishment of hubris.

21. The dialogue breaks off as Zeus begins to speak to the assembly of gods about punishment.
22. The geography of ancient Attica is described as much more fertile and extensive than in Plato's time.
23. The war took place 9,000 years before Solon's time.
24. The story emphasizes the cyclical nature of civilization and catastrophe.
25. It is a philosophical myth about the rise and fall of civilizations due to moral decay.

**LAWS**
1. The best practicable state is ruled by "second-best" means: fixed, divine laws, not a philosopher-king.
2. Law (*nomos*) is the rational prescription of intellect (*nous*), and must be preluded by persuasive explanations.
3. The Athenian Stranger leads the discussion with Cleinias and Megillus.
4. The aim of legislation is to promote virtue (*aretē*), not war or wealth.
5. The city (Magnesia) is to have 5,040 citizen households, a number chosen for its mathematical properties.
6. The gods exist, care for humans, and are not swayed by bribes; impiety laws are severe.
7. Education (*paideia*) is the lifelong process of learning to feel pleasure and pain correctly.
8. Music and dance are strictly regulated to form good character; innovation is dangerous.
9. Private property is allowed, but its use is heavily regulated to minimize inequality and faction.
10. The Nocturnal Council, a body of elder, wise magistrates, meets before dawn to study and guide the law.
11. Slavery is accepted, but masters should not abuse slaves, as it corrupts the master.
12. Women should receive the same education as men and participate in public meals and some civic functions.
13. Marriage is regulated for eugenic purposes.
14. The three main political offices are to be mixed, balancing monarchic and democratic principles.
15. The highest virtue is not wisdom alone, but a harmony of wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice.

17. Atheism is punishable; there are three main types of impiety.
18. The dialogue includes a detailed legal code covering crime, property, family, and commerce.
19. The preludes to laws are rhetorical attempts to foster voluntary compliance, not just fear of punishment.
20. The origin of society is explained through a myth of a pastoral post-cataclysm age.

22. Poetry must be censored; only hymns to gods and praises of good men are allowed.
23. The goal is to make the citizens "willing slaves to the laws."
24. Philosophy is implicit in the laws and studied by the Nocturnal Council, not openly practiced by all.
25. The *Laws* is Plato's most practical work, concerned with implementation, stability, and human frailty.

**ALCIBIADES I** (Disputed)
1. The dialogue's theme: Self-knowledge and political ambition.
2. To care for the city, one must first care for oneself.
3. To care for oneself is to care for one's soul, not one's body or possessions.
4. Self-knowledge is knowledge of the soul, specifically its rational part.
5. The "self" is the soul that uses the body as a tool.
6. To know oneself, one must look into another soul, specifically into its rational element—like looking into a mirror.
7. The divine is the most beautiful mirror for the soul.
8. Alcibiades is ambitious but ignorant of justice and his own ignorance.
9. He has been corrupted by the flattery of the many.
10. Socrates is the only true lover of Alcibiades, caring for his soul.

18. The dialogue is protreptic, aiming to turn Alcibiades toward philosophy.
19. The soul is divine and immortal.
20. Self-knowledge leads to moderation (*sōphrosynē*).
21. Without Socrates's guidance, Alcibiades' ambition will destroy him and Athens.
22. The body is the soul's instrument; the user is superior to the thing used.
23. To rule others, one must first be able to rule oneself.
24. The conversation takes place just before Alcibiades enters public life.
25. It is a foundational text on the Socratic ideal of the care of the soul (*epimeleia tēs psychēs*).

**ALCIBIADES II** (Disputed)
1. The topic is prayer and the knowledge of what is good to ask from the gods.
2. It is dangerous to pray without knowledge, as one might receive harmful things.
3. The story of the misguided prayers of Oedipus and Theseus is cited.
4. The Spartans prayed generically for "good things" to avoid this error.
5. One needs wisdom to know what is truly good.
6. Without wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice can be harmful.
7. Therefore, the only safe prayer is for the gods to give what is good, or simply for wisdom.
8. Ignorance is the root of error in prayer and action.
9. The dialogue is short and likely incomplete.

**CLITOPHON** (Disputed)
1. The dialogue is a critique of Socratic exhortation (*protreptic*).
2. Clitophon praises Socrates for his ability to exhort others to care for virtue and justice.
3. But he criticizes Socrates for only exhorting, not teaching what justice *is* or how to achieve it.
4. Clitophon reports asking Socrates what comes after the exhortation, and receiving unclear answers.
5. He concludes that Socrates is good at creating a desire for virtue but incapable of satisfying it.
6. Clitophon has therefore turned to Thrasymachus for positive instruction.

18. It ends abruptly, perhaps inviting the reader to supply Socrates's defense from other dialogues.
19. Clitophon is an interlocutor in *Republic* Book I.
20. The core issue: Can virtue be taught, and if so, how?
21. Socrates's silence in the face of the critique is notable.
22. It emphasizes the need for the interlocutor's active engagement in the search.
23. The dialogue is a philosophical puzzle about the limits of teaching.
24. It suggests that the "what is X?" question must be answered before the "how to achieve X?" question.
25. Ultimately, it questions the practical efficacy of the Socratic mission.

**EPINOMIS** (Disputed, likely by Philip of Opus)
1. The dialogue is presented as a sequel to *Laws*, with the same characters.
2. Its subject: How to become wise (*sophos*), the highest virtue.
3. Wisdom is defined as knowledge of number (*arithmos*), specifically the study of the stars and planets.
4. The visible gods are the stars and planets, whose orderly motions demonstrate divine reason.
5. Astronomy is the supreme science, leading to piety and understanding.
6. The five elements: fire, water, air, earth, and a fifth—aether (*aithēr*), the material of the heavens.

11. Harmony (music theory) is also necessary.
12. This study constitutes true piety and is the path to becoming a "daemon" after death.
13. Different races have different capacities for wisdom; Greeks are best suited.
14. The dialogue attempts to provide a theological-scientific foundation for the laws of Magnesia.

**EPISTLES** (Disputed authenticity, especially **Letter VII**)
1. **Letter VII** is the most philosophically significant, discussing Plato's involvement in Sicilian politics.
2. It claims a philosophical doctrine cannot be written down, only through long companionship and a spark of understanding.
3. There are three things related to any subject: the name, the definition, the image, and the knowledge of the thing itself.
4. The Fourth is the thing itself (the Form), knowable only by intellect.
5. Writing is inherently inadequate for conveying true philosophical knowledge.
6. Plato went to Sicily three times to tutor Dionysius II and to establish a philosopher-king in Syracuse.

8. True philosophy requires a moral and intellectual conversion, not just learning doctrines.

13. The letters emphasize the connection between philosophy, law, and stable governance.
14. They express pessimism about Athenian democracy and the moral state of Sicily.

**HIPPARCHUS** (Spurious)
1. The dialogue asks: What is love of gain (*philokerdia*)?
2. It is a short, probably spurious dialogue featuring Socrates and a companion.
3. Love of gain is defined as the desire to profit from things of no value.
4. But all men desire good things; to profit is to get something good.
5. Therefore, love of gain, in this sense, would be irrational—desiring to gain what is worthless.
6. The companion is confused by the argument.
7. Socrates tells a story of the tyrant Hipparchus, son of Peisistratus, as a wise ruler who erected herms with moral inscriptions.
8. The story seems somewhat irrelevant to the argument.

11. It may be a satire of Socratic argument or a school exercise.

15. The dialogue lacks depth and dramatic artistry.
16. It may be intended to show a fallacious argument.
17. The love of gain is shown to be, by definition, a desire for the bad, which is impossible.
18. Therefore, the term "love of gain" is problematic.
19. The reference to Hipparchus may be ironic, as he was an enlightened tyrant yet still a tyrant.
20. The forfeit joke at the end reduces the philosophical discussion to a game.
21. It is an example of "Socratic" dialogue degenerating into sophistry.
22. The companion is unnamed, adding to the generic feel.
23. The dialogue is often considered one of the *Dialogi Dubii*.
24. It reflects on the semantics of value terms.
25. Its main interest is as a curio in the Platonic corpus.

**MINOS** (Spurious)
1. The dialogue asks: What is law (*nomos*)?

5. Socrates argues that law is the discovery of reality (*to on*).
6. True law is not mere convention but aims at the truth of things.
7. The example of kings like Minos of Crete, who received laws from Zeus, is given.
8. Minos is rehabilitated from his Athenian reputation as a cruel tyrant.
9. He was a wise ruler and educator, friend of Zeus.
10. Athenian tragedy slandered Minos because he defeated Athens.
11. Law is therefore akin to true opinion about reality.
12. The dialogue connects law with kingship and divine wisdom.
13. It suggests that good laws are based on knowledge of what is.
14. The companion is resistant to rehabilitating Minos.
15. The discussion is rudimentary and abruptly ends.
16. It may be a preface to *Laws* or a school exercise on the nature of law.

18. The dialogue implies a natural law theory: law is the finding of what is by nature just.
19. Socrates criticizes the variability of human laws, suggesting a higher standard.
20. It praises the Cretan constitution (theme of *Laws*).
21. The companion is slow to understand Socrates's distinction between true law and faulty decrees.
22. The definition of law as "the finding of what is" is cryptic.
23. It reinforces the Platonic theme that authority should be based on knowledge.
24. The dialogue is simplistic in its argument and characterization.
25. It serves as a basic introduction to the concept of law as something more than convention.
