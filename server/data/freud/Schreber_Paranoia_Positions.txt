POSITION STATEMENTS: FREUD - PSYCHO-ANALYTIC NOTES ON AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL ACCOUNT OF A CASE OF PARANOIA (SCHREBER, 1911)

================================================================================

PARANOIA AND HOMOSEXUALITY

1. Paranoia originates from the defense against unconscious homosexual wishes.

3. Delusions of persecution arise from the transformation "I love him" into "He hates me."

18. Delusions of jealousy transform "I love him" into "She loves him."

19. Erotomania transforms "I love him" into "She loves me."

================================================================================

PROJECTION MECHANISM

2. The mechanism of projection converts internal perceptions into external perceptions.

13. The voices heard by paranoiacs represent projected self-observations and self-criticisms.

================================================================================

NARCISSISM AND LIBIDO

4. Megalomania results from the withdrawal of libido from external objects back onto the ego.

5. The "end of the world" delusion reflects the subjective experience of libidinal withdrawal from reality.

10. Fixation at the narcissistic stage of development predisposes to paranoid illness.

14. Homosexual object-choice passes through the narcissistic stage of taking oneself as love-object.

16. Detachment of libido from people and things produces the characteristic indifference of schizophrenia.

21. In narcissistic neuroses, libido withdrawn from objects is directed toward the ego rather than fantasy.

================================================================================

DELUSION AS RECOVERY

6. Paranoid delusion-formation is an attempt at recovery—a reconstruction of the lost object-world.

22. The formation of a delusional system provides secondary gain by organizing chaotic mental contents.

================================================================================

SCHREBER'S SYMBOLIC SYSTEM

7. The sun is a sublimated father-symbol in the unconscious.

8. Transformation into a woman in Schreber's delusion represents submission to the father.

9. The relationship to God in Schreber's system represents a distorted father-relationship.

23. Schreber's "soul murder" represents the destruction of his being through homosexual subjugation.

24. The rays of God represent spermatic or seminal influence from the father-figure.

================================================================================

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

11. The choice between neurosis and psychosis depends on the point of libidinal fixation.

12. Dementia praecox (schizophrenia) involves a more severe regression than paranoia.

17. Paraphrenia involves regression to auto-erotism, while paranoia involves regression to narcissism.

20. The libido theory explains the difference between transference neuroses and narcissistic neuroses.

================================================================================

FAMILY IN PARANOIA

15. The brothers and father of the paranoid patient often appear in persecutory delusions.

================================================================================

LOGIC IN DELUSION

25. The paranoiac's systematized delusion demonstrates preserved logical faculties applied to false premises.
