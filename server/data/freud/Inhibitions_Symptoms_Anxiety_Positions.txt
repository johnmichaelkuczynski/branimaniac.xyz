POSITION STATEMENTS: FREUD - INHIBITIONS, SYMPTOMS AND ANXIETY (1926)

================================================================================

INHIBITIONS VS SYMPTOMS

1. An inhibition is the expression of a restriction of an ego-function, not necessarily pathological.

2. A symptom is a substitute for an unachieved instinctual gratification and indicates pathology requiring treatment.

3. Inhibitions differ from symptoms in that inhibitions relate specifically to function while symptoms represent compromise formations between the ego and the id.

================================================================================

THE EGO AND ANXIETY

4. The ego is the actual site of anxiety.

5. Anxiety causes repression, not the other way around (reversing Freud's earlier position).

6. The ego produces anxiety as a signal to mobilize defense mechanisms against perceived danger.

7. Signal anxiety is anticipatory and adaptive, serving to warn the ego of impending danger.

8. Automatic anxiety occurs when the ego is overwhelmed and cannot employ signal anxiety effectively.

================================================================================

CASTRATION AND DEVELOPMENTAL ANXIETY

9. Castration anxiety is the central danger situation in the male psyche and the motive force behind repression.

10. The fear of castration in boys parallels the fear of loss of love in girls.

11. The prolonged helplessness (Hilflosigkeit) of the human infant is a biological factor predisposing humans to neurosis.

12. Birth provides a physiological prototype for later anxiety experiences but is not the direct cause of all neurosis.

13. Otto Rank's theory that birth trauma is the paradigmatic key to understanding all neurosis is rejected.

14. The fetus lacks sufficient awareness during birth to experience psychological trauma in the full sense.

15. Anxiety evolves through developmental stages: fear of object loss, fear of loss of love, castration anxiety, and superego anxiety.

16. Separation anxiety from the mother represents an early danger situation that shapes later anxiety responses.

17. The superego can be a source of anxiety through its demands and threats of punishment.

================================================================================

SYMPTOM FORMATION

18. Symptoms are formed as compromises between instinctual wishes and the ego's defensive operations.

19. Phobias involve displacement of anxiety onto an external substitute object.

20. In Little Hans's case, the horse phobia represented a displacement of castration anxiety related to the father.

21. The inability to go out into the streets was an inhibition the ego imposed to avoid the anxiety-symptom; the replacement of the father by a horse constitutes the symptom proper.

================================================================================

OBSESSIONAL NEUROSIS

22. Obsessional neurosis employs specific defense mechanisms: isolation and undoing (retroactive annulment).

23. Isolation involves detaching an idea from its emotional affect, leaving the idea conscious but emotionally flat.

24. Undoing is a negative magic that attempts to make something that has happened un-happen through symbolic motor action.

25. Obsessional patients create pauses after unpleasurable events during which no perception or action can take place.

26. The taboo against touching in obsessional neurosis reflects the fear that contact will expose unbound ambivalence between love and hate.

27. Obsessional symptoms often unfold in two moments, where the second act symbolically reverses or cancels the first.

28. Regression to the anal-sadistic stage is characteristic of obsessional neurosis.

29. Ambivalence between love and hate is a fundamental feature of obsessional neurosis.

================================================================================

WORK INHIBITIONS

30. Neurotic inhibitions at work take the form of loss of ability, loss of interest, or somatic symptoms like fatigue and giddiness.

31. Specific inhibitions occur when an ego-function takes on unconscious sexual significance for the neurotic subject.

32. Writing, walking, and piano playing may be inhibited when they acquire symbolic sexual meaning.

33. Excessive erotization of an organ can impair the ego-function of that organ.

34. General inhibitions occur when the ego is preoccupied with difficult psychic tasks and must restrict energy expenditure.

35. Mourning and the suppression of affect can cause widespread ego impoverishment and general inhibition.

================================================================================

GUILT AND SUCCESS

36. Inhibitions can serve as self-punishment stemming from unconscious guilt.

37. Fear of success may manifest as inhibition due to oedipal conflicts about surpassing parental figures.

================================================================================

STRUCTURAL AND THEORETICAL POSITIONS

38. There is a two-stage development of sexual life in humans, with particular emphasis on puberty as a critical period.

39. The defects of the mental apparatus lead the ego to treat libidinal drives as dangers.

40. The ego tolerates symptom formation in exchange for having impaired or restrained the dangerous instinct.

41. Mental pain reflects a loss of part of the self rather than loss of the external object.

42. The distinction between realistic anxiety (from external dangers) and neurotic anxiety (from internal dangers) is fundamental.

================================================================================

CASE MATERIAL

43. The phobic symptom achieves a compromise between incestuous desires and their repression.

44. The Wolf Man case demonstrates how passive homosexual fantasies and parricidal wishes contribute to neurosis.

45. Repression bears upon an instinctual impulse with projection onto an external object in phobia formation.

================================================================================

ETIOLOGICAL FACTORS

46. The phylogenetic factor in neurosis involves the inherited two-stage development of human sexuality.

47. The psychological factor in neurosis involves the ego's tendency to treat instinctual demands as if they were external dangers.
