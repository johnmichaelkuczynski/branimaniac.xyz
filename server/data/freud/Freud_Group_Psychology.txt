POSITION STATEMENTS FOR FREUD: GROUP PSYCHOLOGY AND THE ANALYSIS OF THE EGO (1921)

================================================================================

INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP PSYCHOLOGY

1. The opposition between individual psychology and social/group psychology is less sharp than it appears - individual psychology is always already social, involving relations to others.

2. Group psychology concerns the individual as member of a tribe, nation, caste, profession, institution, or crowd.

3. Social instincts are not primary or irreducible - they can be traced back to origins in the narrower family circle.

4. The psychology of groups is the oldest human psychology; individual psychology emerged only gradually from group psychology.

================================================================================

CRITIQUE AND APPROPRIATION OF LE BON

5. Le Bon correctly identified key characteristics of group behavior: diminished intellectual capacity, lack of restraint, incapacity for moderation, and emotional intensification.

6. Groups display heightened suggestibility, contagion of emotions, and a tendency toward extremes.

7. In groups, the heterogeneous is submerged and the unconscious foundations common to all come to the fore.

8. The group mind produces lowered intellectual performance, uninhibited affect, and incapacity for delay - resembling primitive mental life and childhood.

9. Groups are credulous, influenced by images rather than logic, and think in terms of wish-fulfilling associations.

10. Le Bon's description of group characteristics is accurate, but his explanation through "suggestion" and "prestige" is circular and inadequate.

================================================================================

LIBIDO THEORY APPLIED TO GROUPS

11. Libido - the energy of love instincts - is the force that holds groups together.

12. Eros, which holds together everything in the world, is what binds group members to each other and to the leader.

13. Groups are held together by a libidinal bond, not merely by self-interest or rational advantage.

14. The essence of a group lies in the libidinal ties existing within it.

15. Aim-inhibited love (tenderness, affection) is as much a product of sexual instincts as directly sexual love, and is equally capable of forming lasting bonds.

================================================================================

THE ROLE OF THE LEADER

16. Groups require a leader; leaderless groups are unstable or must substitute an abstraction (idea, shared hatred) for the leader.

17. The leader does not need to love the group members; he may be narcissistic, self-confident, and independent.

18. The leader occupies the position of the primal father - he is the group ideal that governs the ego in place of the ego ideal.

19. The leader is loved by all group members, and this shared love for the same object creates the mutual identification among members.

20. The hypnotist and the leader both occupy the place of the ego ideal and exercise power through this position.

================================================================================

THE TWO ARTIFICIAL GROUPS: CHURCH AND ARMY

21. The Church and the Army are highly organized artificial groups that demonstrate the structure of group psychology with clarity.

22. Both groups involve the same libidinal structure: a head (Christ, Commander-in-Chief) who loves all members equally.

23. The illusion of the leader's equal love for all members is essential to group cohesion.

24. Panic in armies results from the dissolution of libidinal ties - the loss of the leader or the sense that he has ceased to care for his followers.

25. Religious intolerance and cruelty toward out-groups stem from the same libidinal bonds that create in-group cohesion.

26. Groups are intolerant of outsiders because narcissistic self-love is limited only by love for others who are libidinally bound to the same object.

================================================================================

IDENTIFICATION

27. Identification is the earliest expression of an emotional tie with another person - it is pre-oedipal and distinct from object-choice.

28. Identification is ambivalent from the start - it can express tenderness as well as the wish to eliminate.

29. There are three sources of identification: (a) the original emotional tie with an object, (b) regressive substitution for an abandoned object-choice by introjection, and (c) perception of a common quality shared with another person who is not a sexual object.

30. Group members are identified with one another through having placed the same object (the leader) in the place of their ego ideal.

31. Identification is partial and highly limited - it borrows a single trait from the object.

32. Hysterical identification involves adopting a symptom from another person with whom one shares an unconscious common element (often a repressed wish).

33. Identification based on shared ego ideal is the primary mechanism of group formation among members.

================================================================================

THE EGO IDEAL

34. The ego ideal is a differentiating grade within the ego - the heir to the original narcissism.

35. The ego ideal has the functions of self-observation, moral conscience, censorship of dreams, and a major influence in repression.

36. In group formation, the ego ideal is replaced by the group's shared object (leader or leading idea).

37. When the ego ideal is externalized and projected onto a leader, the individual relinquishes critical judgment and submits to the group.

38. The separation between ego and ego ideal is reversible - in states of triumph, mania, and group membership, the two may temporarily coincide.

================================================================================

BEING IN LOVE AND HYPNOSIS

39. Being in love involves overvaluation of the object - the object is treated as if it were one's own ego, and serves as a substitute for one's own unattained ego ideal.

40. In extreme love, the ego impoverishes itself in favor of the object; the object consumes the ego.

41. Hypnosis resembles being in love minus direct sexual satisfaction - the hypnotist occupies the place of the ego ideal.

42. Hypnosis is a group of two - it shares the essential structure of group psychology, with the hypnotist as leader.

43. Suggestion, rather than explaining hypnosis and group psychology, is itself a derivative of libido and must itself be explained.

================================================================================

THE PRIMAL HORDE

44. The primal horde (Urhorde) described by Darwin constitutes the prehistoric origin of group psychology.

45. The primal father was free while all other members of the group had their will restricted; individual psychology began with the father.

46. Groups recreate the primal horde situation - the leader is the dreaded primal father, and the group wants to be dominated by unlimited force.

47. The uncanny power of hypnosis derives from its connection to the primal father - the hypnotist awakens a portion of the archaic heritage.

48. The primal father was the original ego ideal; the father of the primal horde was the group ideal that governed individual egos.

49. Totemism, with its taboos, represents the conditions of the overthrown primal father imposed on the group.

================================================================================

NEUROSIS AND GROUP PSYCHOLOGY

50. Neurosis is antisocial - it achieves privately what group formation achieves through collective means.

51. The neurotic creates his own private substitutive formations (symptoms) instead of participating in shared group formations.

52. The complaint that civilization is responsible for neurosis contains a kernel of truth - neurotic substitutes are attempts to achieve what society achieves through collective institutions.

================================================================================

ADDITIONAL STRUCTURAL POSITIONS

53. There is a gradation from being in love, through hypnosis, to group formation - all involve the same libidinal dynamics with variation in the sexual aim and number of objects.

54. Groups can substitute a common tendency, wish, or abstraction for a concrete leader - even shared hatred can unify.

55. The group increases affect and diminishes intellect because identification with fellow members permits regression to early mental states.

56. Herd instinct (Trotter) does not explain group formation; rather, the sibling relationship and shared parental attachment explain the later sense of group belonging.
