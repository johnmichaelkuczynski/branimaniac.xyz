**FIVE LECTURES ON PSYCHO-ANALYSIS (1910)**

1. Hysterical symptoms have psychological meaning and can be traced to specific traumatic experiences.
2. The method of free association is superior to hypnosis for accessing unconscious material.
3. Dream interpretation is the royal road to knowledge of the unconscious.
4. Dreams possess latent content hidden behind manifest content through processes of condensation and displacement.
5. Repression is a defense mechanism whereby incompatible ideas are forced out of consciousness.
6. Resistance encountered during analysis is the same force that originally produced repression.
7. Symptoms are substitute formations representing repressed wishes in distorted form.
8. Infantile sexuality exists and develops through distinct stages (oral, anal, phallic).
9. The Oedipus complex is a universal phenomenon in which children take parents as their first love objects.
10. Neurosis originates from conflicts between sexual impulses and the forces that repress them.
11. Transference is the phenomenon whereby patients unconsciously transfer feelings from past relationships onto the analyst.
12. Childhood experiences, particularly sexual ones, determine susceptibility to later neurosis.
13. The unconscious operates according to its own laws distinct from conscious thought.
14. Psychoanalytic treatment works by making the unconscious conscious.
15. The therapeutic relationship recreates early conflictual relationships, enabling their resolution.

**INTRODUCTORY LECTURES ON PSYCHO-ANALYSIS (1916-17)**

16. Parapraxes (slips of tongue, forgetting, bungled actions) have meaning and reveal unconscious intentions.
17. Apparently accidental mental phenomena are psychically determined.
18. Parapraxes arise from the interference of two different intentions, one conscious and one unconscious.
19. Dreams are the fulfillment of repressed wishes, typically infantile in origin.
20. Dream-work transforms latent thoughts into manifest content through condensation, displacement, and secondary revision.
21. Symbols in dreams have relatively constant meanings, particularly regarding sexual content.
22. The censorship function operates during sleep to disguise forbidden wish-fulfillments.
23. Anxiety dreams and punishment dreams do not contradict wish-fulfillment theory but represent wishes of the superego or self-punishment.
24. Neurotic symptoms, like dreams, are compromise formations between conflicting psychical forces.
25. Fixation at early libidinal stages predisposes individuals to specific forms of neurosis.
26. Regression to earlier developmental stages occurs when later development is blocked.
27. The libido can become attached to objects or can be withdrawn onto the ego (narcissism).
28. Actual neuroses differ from psychoneuroses in having a contemporary somatic etiology rather than psychological conflict.
29. Obsessional neurosis involves regression to the anal-sadistic stage and ambivalence toward objects.
30. Hysteria involves conversion of psychical conflict into somatic symptoms.
31. The transference neurosis that develops in analysis provides access to the patient's pathogenic conflicts.
32. Resistance takes multiple forms: repression resistance, transference resistance, secondary gain resistance, id resistance, and superego resistance.
33. Working through resistances is essential to therapeutic success.
34. The analyst must maintain neutrality and use the patient's transference as a therapeutic instrument.

**NEW INTRODUCTORY LECTURES ON PSYCHO-ANALYSIS (1933)**

35. The psyche is divided into three agencies: id, ego, and superego.
36. The id is the reservoir of instinctual drives, operates according to the pleasure principle, and is entirely unconscious.
37. The ego is the portion of the id modified by contact with external reality and mediates between id, superego, and external world.
38. The superego is formed through internalization of parental authority and the dissolution of the Oedipus complex.
39. The superego functions as conscience and ego ideal, enforcing moral restrictions and striving toward perfection.
40. The ego serves three tyrannical masters: the id, superego, and external reality.
41. Anxiety is a signal function of the ego warning of danger situations.
42. Different developmental stages correspond to different danger situations: loss of object, loss of love, castration anxiety, superego anxiety.
43. The death instinct (Thanatos) operates alongside the life instinct (Eros) and manifests as aggression and self-destruction.
44. Instincts can fuse or defuse, with aggression becoming more dangerous when separated from erotic binding.
45. Female psychosexual development differs from male development, with the girl having to change both erogenous zone and love object.
46. Penis envy plays a central role in female development, leading to the castration complex and its consequences.
47. The superego in women develops differently and may be less impersonal than in men.
48. Telepathy and thought-transference, while requiring scientific caution, cannot be dismissed a priori.
49. Psychoanalysis is a natural science and maintains a scientific worldview (Weltanschauung).
50. Religion is an illusion based on wish-fulfillment and the projection of the father complex onto the cosmos.
