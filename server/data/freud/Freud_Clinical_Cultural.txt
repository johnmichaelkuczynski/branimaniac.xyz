Here are **100 Position Statements on Transference and Countertransference** based on Freud’s writings and the subsequent psychoanalytic tradition he initiated.

---

### **Freud’s Positions on Transference & Countertransference**

#### **TRANSFERENCE (1–70)**

**Definition & Nature**
1. **Transference** is the displacement of feelings, attitudes, and fantasies from past significant figures onto the analyst.
2. It is an **unconscious process**—the patient is unaware they are transferring.
3. Transference is **inevitable** in psychoanalysis—it arises spontaneously.
4. It is a **repetition** of earlier object relations, not a new experience.
5. Transference turns the analyst into a **parental substitute**.
6. It is a **resistance** when it avoids remembering by enacting instead.
7. It is also the **most powerful tool** for change when analyzed.
8. Transference is **ubiquitous**—it occurs in all relationships, not just therapy.
9. It is rooted in **infantile prototypes** (mother, father, siblings).
10. Transference is **ambivalent**—can be loving (positive) or hostile (negative).

**Forms of Transference**
11. **Positive transference**: affectionate, loving, idealizing feelings toward the analyst.
12. **Negative transference**: hostile, angry, suspicious feelings toward the analyst.
13. **Erotic transference**: sexualized feelings and fantasies about the analyst.
14. **Paternal transference**: analyst as father figure—authoritative, punishing, protective.
15. **Maternal transference**: analyst as mother figure—nurturing, engulfing, abandoning.
16. **Sibling transference**: analyst as rival or ally.
17. **Transference of defense**: patient treats analyst as they defended against a parent.
18. **Transference neurosis**: a structured re‑creation of the childhood neurosis within the analysis.
19. **Transference psychosis**: analyst is incorporated into delusional system.
20. **Mild vs. intense transference**: varies with patient’s pathology and analytic situation.

**Clinical Manifestations**
21. Transference appears in **dreams about the analyst**.
22. It shapes how the patient **hears interpretations** (as criticism, seduction, etc.).
23. It influences **session attendance** (eagerness, lateness, cancellations).
24. It colors **free association** (what is said and withheld).
25. It emerges in **nonverbal behavior** (posture, eye contact, dress).
26. It appears in **gift‑giving**, **compliments**, or **attacks**.
27. **Silence** can be a transference communication.
28. **Questions** to the analyst often carry transference meanings.
29. **Compliance** or **defiance** to the fundamental rule reflects transference.
30. **Fee discussions** often activate parental transference (providing/withholding).

**Therapeutic Use of Transference**
31. **Analysis of transference** is the central task of psychoanalysis.
32. The analyst must **allow transference to develop** without interfering.
33. Transference interpretation should be **timely and tactful**.
34. Interpret **resistance in the transference** first.
35. Connect transference feelings to **past relationships** (“then and there” to “here and now”).
36. Use transference to make the **unconscious conscious** in the immediacy of the session.
37. **Transference gratification** should be avoided—the analyst remains neutral.
38. **Transference frustration** (abstinence) promotes regression and revelation.
39. **Working through** transference patterns is repetitive and gradual.
40. **Resolution of transference** is necessary for termination.

**Transference & Diagnosis**
41. **Hysterics** develop intense, eroticized transferences.
42. **Obsessionals** develop intellectualized, resistant transferences.
43. **Narcissistic patients** may show mirroring or idealizing transferences.
44. **Borderline patients** develop split, unstable, intense transferences.
45. **Psychotic patients** may develop psychotic transference (delusional).
46. **Depressed patients** may transfer helplessness or guilt.
47. **Phobic patients** may transfer fear of abandonment or penetration.
48. **Trauma survivors** may re‑enact trauma in transference.

64. **Interpret from surface to depth**—start with what is conscious.
65. Use the patient’s own **words and metaphors** in interpretation.

69. **Document transference patterns** over time.
70. **Termination** involves mourning the transference relationship.

#### **COUNTERTRANSFERENCE (71–100)**

**Definition & Nature**
71. **Countertransference** is the analyst’s emotional reaction to the patient.
72. It includes feelings, fantasies, and attitudes stirred by the patient.
73. Originally seen as an **obstacle**—the analyst’s unresolved neurosis.
74. Later viewed as a **tool**—providing information about the patient’s unconscious.
75. It can be **conscious or unconscious** in the analyst.
76. It is inevitable—no analyst is free of countertransference.
77. It is **complementary** (reacting to patient’s transference) or **concordant** (identifying with patient).
78. **Chronic countertransference** stems from analyst’s unresolved conflicts.
79. **Acute countertransference** is situation‑specific to the patient.

92. **Continuous self‑analysis** during and between sessions.
93. Use countertransference as **data** about the patient’s projective identifications.
94. **Monitor bodily reactions** (sleepiness, tension) as countertransference signals.
95. **Consult supervision** when countertransference is persistent or troubling.
96. **Do not act out** countertransference (e.g., become seductive, punitive).
97. **Interpret countertransference‑based interventions** cautiously.
98. Sometimes **disclose countertransference** tactfully if it furthers the analysis.
99. **Set boundaries** to protect patient and analyst from acting out.
100. Ultimately, **countertransference is the analyst’s best instrument for understanding the patient’s unconscious** when analyzed rather than enacted.
