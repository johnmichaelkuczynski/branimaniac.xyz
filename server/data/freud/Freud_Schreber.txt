POSITION STATEMENTS: FREUD - PSYCHO-ANALYTIC NOTES ON AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL ACCOUNT OF A CASE OF PARANOIA (SCHREBER, 1911)

1. Paranoia originates from the defense against unconscious homosexual wishes.
2. The mechanism of projection converts internal perceptions into external perceptions.
3. Delusions of persecution arise from the transformation "I love him" into "He hates me."
4. Megalomania results from the withdrawal of libido from external objects back onto the ego.
5. The "end of the world" delusion reflects the subjective experience of libidinal withdrawal from reality.
6. Paranoid delusion-formation is an attempt at recovery—a reconstruction of the lost object-world.
7. The sun is a sublimated father-symbol in the unconscious.
8. Transformation into a woman in Schreber's delusion represents submission to the father.
9. The relationship to God in Schreber's system represents a distorted father-relationship.
10. Fixation at the narcissistic stage of development predisposes to paranoid illness.
11. The choice between neurosis and psychosis depends on the point of libidinal fixation.
12. Dementia praecox (schizophrenia) involves a more severe regression than paranoia.
13. The voices heard by paranoiacs represent projected self-observations and self-criticisms.
14. Homosexual object-choice passes through the narcissistic stage of taking oneself as love-object.
15. The brothers and father of the paranoid patient often appear in persecutory delusions.
16. Detachment of libido from people and things produces the characteristic indifference of schizophrenia.
17. Paraphrenia involves regression to auto-erotism, while paranoia involves regression to narcissism.
18. Delusions of jealousy transform "I love him" into "She loves him."
19. Erotomania transforms "I love him" into "She loves me."
20. The libido theory explains the difference between transference neuroses and narcissistic neuroses.
21. In narcissistic neuroses, libido withdrawn from objects is directed toward the ego rather than fantasy.
22. The formation of a delusional system provides secondary gain by organizing chaotic mental contents.
23. Schreber's "soul murder" represents the destruction of his being through homosexual subjugation.
24. The rays of God represent spermatic or seminal influence from the father-figure.
25. The paranoiac's systematized delusion demonstrates preserved logical faculties applied to false premises.
