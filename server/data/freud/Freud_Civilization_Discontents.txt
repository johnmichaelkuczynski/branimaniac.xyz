POSITION STATEMENT FREUD CIVILIZATION AND ITS DISCONTENTS

1. There exists a fundamental and irresolvable tension between the individual's desire for instinctive freedom and civilization's demand for conformity and repression.

2. Human beings possess certain characteristic instincts that are immutable and cannot be eliminated, only redirected or suppressed.

3. Primitive instincts such as the desire to kill and the insatiable craving for sexual gratification are inherently harmful to collective wellbeing.

4. Civilization requires the renunciation of instinctual satisfaction as its most essential characteristic.

5. The guilty conscience is the psychological price paid by individuals to belong to civilized society.

6. Guilt often remains unconscious and manifests as anxiety or generalized discontent.

7. The "oceanic feeling" of limitlessness and connection to the universe is a residue of early infantile ego-states rather than evidence of religious truth.

8. Religion functions as a mass delusion that helps humans cope with suffering but exacts an enormous psychological cost.

9. The ego is not sharply delimited but extends inward into an unconscious entity called the id.

10. In infancy, the ego includes everything; the division between self and external world develops through experience.

11. There are three primary sources of human suffering: the frailty of our bodies, the superior power of nature, and the inadequacy of social regulations.

12. Of these sources of suffering, social relations appear controllable but prove to have obdurate psychological causes that resist reform.

13. Civilization is built upon wish-fulfillments of human ideals including control, beauty, hygiene, order, and intellectual achievement.

14. The development of civilization parallels the libidinal development of the individual.

15. Civilization serves to redistribute pleasure more equally among individuals while demanding compromises in innate egocentrism.

16. Human beings enter social bonds by sacrificing a portion of their happiness in exchange for greater security.

17. Eros and Ananke—love and necessity—are the two parents of civilization.

18. The purpose of Eros is to combine individuals, then families, then races, peoples, and nations into one great unity of mankind.

19. There exists alongside Eros an independent aggressive instinct—the death drive or Thanatos—that shares world-dominion with the life instinct.

20. The inclination to aggression is an original, self-subsisting instinctual disposition in human beings.

21. Aggression constitutes the greatest impediment to civilization.

22. The evolution of civilization represents the struggle between Eros and Death, between the instinct of life and the instinct of destruction.

23. Civilization obtains mastery over individual aggression by installing the super-ego as an internal agency to watch over dangerous desires.

24. The super-ego develops through the internalization of aggressive instincts that cannot be successfully directed outward.

25. Instincts can never be dispelled but only diverted or redirected according to the economy of the psyche.

26. The more aggression that is diverted inward, the greater the power of the super-ego becomes.

27. Those least inclined to immoral acts are often most severely punished by their own conscience.

28. Guilt is produced both for misdeeds actually committed and for the mere intention of committing misdeeds.

29. Human culture is bound up in an ancient Oedipal drama of brothers banding together to kill their father and then creating rules to mediate ambivalent desires.

30. The commandment "Love thy neighbor" is psychologically untenable because human beings are primarily aggressive rather than loving.

31. Love within families and groups tends to isolate these units and prevent individuals from maturing independently.

32. When instinctual trends undergo repression, their libidinal elements become neurotic symptoms while aggressive elements form the basis for guilt.

33. There may exist a "cultural super-ego" that functions as a conscience for society as a whole.

34. The cultural super-ego, like its individual counterpart, often makes excessive demands that should be lowered.

35. Professional work offers a means of sublimation that can displace libidinal components—narcissistic, aggressive, and erotic—onto productive activity.

36. Freely chosen work that enables sublimation of existing inclinations is a source of special satisfaction.

37. Man has become a "prosthetic God" through technological advancement, yet increased misery accompanies these achievements.

38. The assertion that we would be happier if we abandoned civilization and returned to primitive conditions is ridiculous.

39. Civilization may not bring liberty or happiness, but it does restrain primitive impulses and prevent many problems.

40. The "psychological poverty of groups" poses a danger when social bonds are constituted primarily by identification among members rather than by genuine leadership.

41. Societies themselves, like individuals, can be understood as having psychologically determined "characters" reflecting different blends of Eros and Thanatos.

42. Societies, like individuals, may become "neurotic" when overcome by excess anxiety regarding base impulses.

43. A real change in relations to possessions would help civilization more than ethical commands, but this recognition has been obscured by idealistic misconceptions of human nature.

44. The sacrifice of libidinal pleasure and happiness in return for security may not be worth the effort, though this cannot be conclusively determined.

45. The final question for humanity is whether civilization can prevail over the human instinct of aggression and self-destruction.

46. Religion helps civilizations by taming asocial instincts and creating community around shared beliefs.

47. Organized religion makes individuals perpetually subordinate to the primal father figure embodied by God.

48. The death instinct originally aims at self-destruction but is partially diverted outward as aggression to protect the organism.

49. Sadism and masochism are manifestations of the death drive directed outward and inward respectively.

50. Repetition of painful situations, self-destructiveness, and death wishes are expressions of the internally directed death drive.
