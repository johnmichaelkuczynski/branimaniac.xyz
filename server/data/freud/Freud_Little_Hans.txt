POSITION STATEMENTS: FREUD - ANALYSIS OF A PHOBIA IN A FIVE-YEAR-OLD BOY (LITTLE HANS, 1909)

1. Infantile sexuality is a universal phenomenon and not a pathological aberration.
2. The Oedipus complex—sexual love for the opposite-sex parent and rivalry with the same-sex parent—is the nuclear complex of neurosis.
3. Castration anxiety arises from threats (real or imagined) connected to masturbatory activity in childhood.
4. Phobias are formed through the displacement of anxiety from an internal danger to an external object.
5. The choice of phobic object is determined by symbolic connections and associative links in the child's experience.
6. Horses can symbolically represent the father in a child's unconscious fantasy life.
7. Anxiety in phobias originates from the repression of libidinal impulses.
8. Children develop sexual theories to explain reproduction, birth, and anatomical differences.
9. The discovery of anatomical sex differences produces the castration complex in boys.
10. Ambivalence—the coexistence of love and hatred toward the same object—is characteristic of childhood emotional life.
11. The fear of being bitten represents transformed aggressive and libidinal impulses toward the father.
12. Repression transforms libido into anxiety when direct satisfaction is blocked.
13. The birth of a sibling activates jealousy and death wishes in the older child.
14. Children's sexual researches are motivated by practical concerns about their position in the family.
15. The resolution of the Oedipus complex involves identification with the same-sex parent.
16. Phobic avoidance serves to prevent the arousal of anxiety associated with forbidden wishes.
17. The father is both loved and feared as a rival for the mother's affection.
18. Sexual curiosity in children is normal and should not be met with punishment or deception.
19. The lumf (feces) and widdler (penis) theories reflect children's attempts to understand bodily functions.
20. The fantasy of the "big giraffe" and "crumpled giraffe" symbolizes taking possession of the mother.
21. Analysis conducted through a parent can be effective when the parent is properly instructed.
22. The symbolic equation of feces, baby, and penis underlies much of infantile sexual theorizing.
23. The child's wish to sleep with the mother represents a direct expression of Oedipal desire.
24. Fear of heavily loaded carts represents anxiety about the pregnant mother and birth.
25. Recovery from phobia occurs when repressed material is made conscious and the underlying conflicts are resolved.
