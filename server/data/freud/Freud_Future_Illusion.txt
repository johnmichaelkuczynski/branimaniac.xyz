POSITION STATEMENTS: FREUD - THE FUTURE OF AN ILLUSION (1927)

1. Civilization exists to help individuals repress their animalistic and violent instincts, allowing them to live in harmonious community.
2. The individual is essentially an enemy of society and has instinctual urges that must be restrained to help society function.
3. Human nature is anti-social, rebellious, and has high sexual and destructive tendencies.
4. Among the fundamental instinctual wishes that must be repressed are those of incest, cannibalism, and lust for killing.
5. Masses are lazy and unintelligent; they have no love for instinctual renunciation and cannot be convinced by argument of its inevitability.
6. Civilization rests on labor, coercion, and instinctual renunciation that provoke resistance.
7. Religion first arose as early humans sought to explain nature's forces by imagining they were controlled by human-like gods.
8. The personification of nature allows humans to deal psychically with forces that would otherwise remain incomprehensible and terrifying.
9. Religion transformed from polytheism to monotheism, with a single father-like God believed to exist to protect his followers.
10. Religious ideas are illusions, consisting of dogmas and assertions about external and internal reality that claim credence without independent verification.
11. Religious concepts are transmitted in three ways: because primal ancestors believed them, because proofs have been handed down from antiquity, and because questioning their authenticity is forbidden.
12. Religious beliefs represent wish-fulfillment—fulfillments of the oldest, strongest, and most urgent wishes of mankind.
13. An illusion is a belief in which wish-fulfillment is a prominent factor in its motivation, disregarding its relations to reality.
14. The gods serve a threefold task: exorcising the terrors of nature, reconciling men to the cruelty of fate (especially death), and compensating them for the sufferings and privations of civilized life.
15. Religion is a projection of infantile helplessness and father-longing that humanizes nature, promises justice and an afterlife, and asserts authority without proof.
16. The mother, who satisfies the child's hunger, becomes its first love-object and first protection against undefined dangers—its first protection against anxiety.
17. In the protective function, the mother is soon replaced by the stronger father, who retains that position for the rest of childhood.
18. The libido follows paths of narcissistic needs and attaches itself to objects ensuring satisfaction of those needs.
19. When we become adults, we become aware of the fallibility of our fathers yet still have need for protection.
20. Humans create the idea of a Divine Father to take the place of the human father.
21. Religious belief is an infantile neurosis in need of a cure so the person can become a healthy mature adult.
22. Nature is a threat that civilization inadequately responds to; civilization's task is to defend us against nature, which seeks coldly, cruelly, and relentlessly to destroy us.
23. Religion serves as a method to end suffering and doubt, helping people find purpose in life.
24. Religion helps formulate positive moral codes which allow communal existence of humanity.
25. Religious teachings lack evidentiary support, and it is impossible to independently verify their claims.
26. Religion exists to fulfill humanity's wishes to not feel insignificant in the scheme of the universe.
27. Religion should be understood as a universal obsessional neurosis with totemic roots.
28. Religion has been applied by leaders to control forces of nature and extract wealth from the masses.
29. Religion has been imposed by a minority using power and coercion to obtain possession and control.
30. Cultural prohibitions enforced through religion suppress people and the innate nature of human failure.
31. The concept of sin—being unworthy of love unless one behaves in a certain manner—is mainly used as a power of coercion.
32. Laws and moral precepts should be justified by social necessity rather than divine mandate.
33. Society would benefit from an "education to reality" and gradual reliance on reason and science.
34. The scientific spirit engenders particular attitudes toward worldly matters; before religious matters it pauses, hesitates, and finally crosses the threshold.
35. Science can eventually provide explanations that go beyond the limitations of religion.
36. Reason should replace faith in God as the basis for civilization.
37. Better alternatives to religion must exist for achieving social order and individual emotional fulfillment.
38. Religion can be removed from civilization without risk or harm to people.
39. If being devoutly religious were truly a sign of great intellect, there should be no harm caused by anti-religious arguments.
40. Religion has not done enough for humanity despite its contributions; it has failed to make people happier or more moral.
41. Human society can only advance by abandoning the collective neurosis that plagues societal development.
42. Giving up expectation of another world will motivate people to work harder to make this world better and happier.
43. Religion sanctions violations of fundamental principles of society through concepts like confession and absolution.
44. The philosophy of "as if"—behaving as if religious doctrines were true for practical reasons—is not far removed from "credo quia absurdum."
45. No personal revelation or state of ecstasy, however deeply moving to one individual, can establish the truth of religious doctrines for others.
46. Scientific illusions differ from religious illusions in that they can be altered, updated, or scrapped without penalty.
47. The transition from religious to scientific worldview will be slow and contested.
48. Psychoanalysis reveals the same motives for religious formation as the infantile contribution to manifest motives.
49. Religion keeps people in an infantile psychological state rather than promoting mature development.
50. The conflict between religion and science is irreconcilable; they are mortal enemies.
