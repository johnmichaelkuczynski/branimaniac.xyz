POSITION STATEMENTS
FREUD: SELECTED PAPERS

========================================
THE UNCANNY (1919)
========================================

1. The uncanny (unheimlich) is that class of frightening things which leads us back to what is known and familiar.

2. The German word heimlich contains within its semantic range a meaning that overlaps with its opposite unheimlich; what is homely and familiar also means what is concealed and hidden.

3. The uncanny is the mark of the return of the repressed—something familiar that has become alienated through the process of repression.

4. Intellectual uncertainty about whether something is animate or inanimate (automata, dolls, waxwork figures) contributes to uncanny feelings.

5. The fear of losing one's eyes, as in Hoffmann's "The Sandman," is a substitute for the dread of castration.

6. The figure of the double (doppelgänger) was originally an insurance against the destruction of the ego and a denial of the power of death.

7. When the stage of primary narcissism is surmounted, the double changes from an assurance of immortality into the uncanny harbinger of death.

8. The double embodies all the unfulfilled possibilities of our lives, suppressed acts of volition, and frustrated strivings of the ego.

9. Repetition of the same situations, events, or numbers produces uncanny effects by suggesting the operation of fateful forces.

10. The omnipotence of thoughts—the overvaluation of mental processes over reality—is a source of uncanny feelings when it appears confirmed.

11. There is a distinction between the uncanny as actually experienced and the uncanny as merely pictured or read about in fiction.

12. Fiction can produce more uncanny effects than real life because the author can control the conditions under which events occur.

13. Uncanny effects in fiction are limited when the author establishes a realistic setting that conforms to ordinary reality.

14. The uncanny arises when infantile complexes that have been repressed are revived, or when primitive beliefs that have been surmounted seem confirmed.

15. The return of the dead, ghosts, and spirits produce uncanny effects because primitive fear of the dead persists despite intellectual surmounting.

========================================
CRIMINALS FROM A SENSE OF GUILT (1916)
========================================

16. Some individuals commit crimes because they are suffering from an oppressive sense of guilt of unknown origin that precedes the criminal act.

17. Criminal acts in such cases serve to attach the pre-existing, free-floating sense of guilt to something concrete and explicable.

18. The commission of a crime brings relief because the external punishment it invites is less severe than the internal torment of unconscious guilt.

19. The obscure sense of guilt that precedes crime derives from the Oedipus complex—from wishes to kill the father and have sexual relations with the mother.

20. This mechanism of crime from guilt feelings does not apply to criminals without moral inhibitions or those who rationalize their antisocial behavior.

21. Many minor infractions committed during analytic treatment can be understood as attempts to alleviate an unbearable sense of guilt.

22. The "pale criminal" described by Nietzsche can be understood psychoanalytically as one driven to crime by unconscious guilt seeking punishment.

23. Children often become naughty in order to provoke punishment, after which they become calm and satisfied.

24. The desire for punishment from parental figures can persist into adult life and motivate seemingly inexplicable criminal behavior.

========================================
NEGATION (1925)
========================================

25. Negation is a way of taking cognizance of what is repressed; it constitutes a lifting of repression, though not an acceptance of the repressed content.

26. When a patient says "It is not my mother" in reporting a dream figure, this negation is the surest indication that it is indeed the mother.

27. Negation allows repressed ideational content to reach consciousness on the condition that it is denied—separating intellectual function from affective process.

28. The outcome of negation is intellectual acceptance of the repressed while the essential aspect of repression persists emotionally.

29. Conquering the patient's negation and achieving intellectual acceptance does not automatically remove the repressive process itself.

30. Judgment has two functions: affirming or disaffirming that a thing possesses a particular attribute, and asserting or disputing that a presentation exists in reality.

31. The function of judgment concerning attributes derives from the original interplay of introjection and projection based on the pleasure principle.

32. The original pleasure-ego wants to introject all that is good and expel all that is bad, equating good with ego and bad with external.

33. The reality-ego develops the capacity to refind in perception an object that corresponds to what was once a source of real satisfaction.

34. Reality-testing determines whether something that exists as a presentation in the ego can also be rediscovered in perception.

35. Thinking possesses the capacity to bring before the mind something perceived in the past by reproducing it as a presentation without the external object.

36. Affirmation—as a substitute for uniting—belongs to Eros; negation—the successor to expulsion—belongs to the instinct of destruction.

37. The general wish to negate displayed by some psychotics may indicate a defusion of instincts through withdrawal of libidinal components.

38. There is no "no" in the unconscious; recognition of the unconscious by the ego is expressed in a negative formula.

========================================
CIVILIZED SEXUAL MORALITY AND MODERN NERVOUS ILLNESS (1908)
========================================

39. Civilization imposes sexual frustration that has a direct effect on the genesis of neuroses.

40. There are three stages of civilization with respect to sexual instinct: free exercise of sexuality, restriction to reproduction only, and restriction to legitimate reproduction only.

41. Modern civilized sexual morality demands abstinence until marriage and monogamous fidelity within it—standards most people cannot meet without damage.

42. Sublimation of sexual instinctual forces toward higher cultural aims can only be achieved by a minority, and then only intermittently.

43. The sexual instinct is not originally designed to serve reproduction but aims at obtaining particular kinds of pleasure (organ-pleasure).

44. Suppression of the sexual life of civilized peoples through conventional morality causes nervous illness on a large scale.

45. Women suffer particularly from civilized sexual morality because their legitimate sexual outlet within marriage is often unsatisfying.

46. Premarital sexual abstinence damages women's capacity for full sexual response and damages men's capacity for tender relationships.

47. The cultural gains achieved through sexual repression may be offset by the intellectual and creative losses caused by neurosis.

48. Neurotic illness represents a flight into illness when the ego cannot otherwise manage the demands of civilization upon sexuality.

49. Marriage under current conditions often fails to satisfy the sexual needs of either partner and prohibits the extramarital satisfaction that might compensate.

50. The strict sexual morality that injures individuals ultimately injures society by producing widespread neurosis and diminished productivity.

========================================
REPRESSION (1915)
========================================

51. Repression is a preliminary stage of condemnation, something between flight and judgment; the ego cannot escape from instinctual demands as it can from external stimuli.

52. The motive and purpose of repression is the avoidance of unpleasure; repression occurs when satisfaction of an instinct would produce unpleasure instead of pleasure.

53. Primal repression (Urverdrängung) is the first phase of repression in which the psychical representative of an instinct is denied entrance into consciousness.

54. Primal repression establishes a fixation; the repressed representative persists unaltered and the instinct remains attached to it.

55. Repression proper (or after-pressure) is a second phase affecting psychical derivatives of the repressed representative or associative chains connected to it.

56. Repression proper involves both attraction from what was primally repressed and repulsion from consciousness acting together.

57. Repression is not a single event but requires continuous expenditure of force to maintain; its removal results in an economic saving.

58. The repressed exercises continuous pressure toward consciousness, which must be balanced by unceasing counter-pressure (anticathexis).

59. Derivatives of the repressed can gain access to consciousness if they are sufficiently distorted or distant from the original repressed material.

60. Repression acts individually on each derivative of the repressed; each must undergo its own fate depending on its degree of distortion.

61. It is not repression itself that produces symptoms, but rather the return of the repressed—symptoms are indicators of such return.

62. In anxiety hysteria, repression is initially successful but fails as excitation spreads to substitute formations (phobias) requiring fresh efforts of repression.

63. In conversion hysteria, repression may succeed in disposing of affect entirely, but the ideational content finds expression through somatic innervation.

64. In obsessional neurosis, the initial repression is followed by failure, return of the repressed, and secondary defensive measures (reaction formations, obsessive actions).

========================================
INSTINCTS AND THEIR VICISSITUDES (1915)
========================================

65. An instinct (Trieb) is a stimulus to the mind arising from within the organism, operating as a constant force that cannot be escaped through flight.

66. An instinct has four characteristics: pressure (motor force), aim (satisfaction through removal of stimulation), object (means to the aim), and source (somatic process).

67. The object of an instinct is its most variable characteristic; it is not originally connected with the instinct and becomes attached through its fitness for satisfaction.

68. The two primary groups of instincts are the ego or self-preservative instincts and the sexual instincts.

69. Sexual instincts are distinguished by their ability to change objects readily and their capacity for sublimation.

70. The four vicissitudes (fates) that instincts may undergo are: reversal into the opposite, turning round upon the subject's own self, repression, and sublimation.

71. Reversal into the opposite involves either a change from activity to passivity (in aims) or a reversal of content (transformation of love into hate).

72. Turning round upon the subject's own self involves changing the object while the aim remains the same—as when sadism becomes masochism.

73. In the transformation from sadism to masochism, there is a change of object (from another to the self) and a change of aim (from active to passive).

74. The preliminary narcissistic stage intervenes between sadistic and masochistic phases, where the self becomes the object.

75. Voyeurism and exhibitionism represent parallel transformations: looking at an external object, looking at one's own body, being looked at.

76. Masochism is actually sadism turned round upon the subject's own ego, and the masochist shares in the enjoyment of the assault upon himself.

77. Love and hate are not related to each other as simple opposites; they have complex and independent developmental histories.

78. Hate as a relation to objects is older than love; it derives from the narcissistic ego's primordial repudiation of the external world and its stimuli.

79. At the preliminary stages of love (incorporating, mastering), love is hardly distinguishable from hate in its attitude toward the object.

80. The three great polarities governing mental life are: subject (ego) versus object (external world), pleasure versus unpleasure, and active versus passive.

========================================
SOME CHARACTER TYPES MET WITH IN PSYCHO-ANALYTIC WORK (1916)
========================================

81. "The Exceptions" are those who feel entitled to special privileges in compensation for early injury or suffering they experienced as innocent children.

82. Exceptions believe their early undeserved suffering exempts them from the renunciations that others must accept as part of normal life.

83. Richard III, as depicted by Shakespeare, exemplifies the Exception who claims the right to be unjust because Nature was first unjust to him.

84. Women often feel entitled to make exceptional demands because they regard themselves as having been damaged through no fault of their own (castration).

85. "Those Wrecked by Success" are people who fall ill precisely when a deeply-rooted wish comes to fulfillment—illness replaces the expected happiness.

86. The paradox of wrecked by success shows that internal forces of conscience can prohibit enjoyment of what has been legitimately attained.

87. Lady Macbeth exemplifies one wrecked by success, falling ill when she achieves the crown she desired, destroyed by the very fulfillment of her ambition.

88. Rebecca West in Ibsen's Rosmersholm similarly collapses when marriage to Rosmer becomes possible, as if success revealed forbidden Oedipal wishes.

89. The collapse upon success occurs because achieving the forbidden wish makes the underlying Oedipal guilt conscious and intolerable.

90. Unconscious guilt can remain dormant while a wish remains unfulfilled but becomes overwhelming when external obstacles are removed.

========================================
SOME NEUROTIC MECHANISMS IN JEALOUSY, PARANOIA, AND HOMOSEXUALITY (1922)
========================================

91. Jealousy is one of those affective states that may be described as normal; its absence in someone indicates severe repression and great unconscious significance.

92. There are three layers of jealousy: competitive or normal jealousy, projected jealousy, and delusional jealousy.

93. Normal jealousy is compounded of grief over the lost loved object, narcissistic wound, and hostile feelings toward the successful rival.

94. Normal jealousy is rooted in the Oedipus complex and sibling rivalry; it also draws on unconscious homosexual attraction to the rival.

95. Projected jealousy derives from actual unfaithfulness on the subject's part or from repressed impulses toward unfaithfulness.

96. In projected jealousy, subjects who resist their own temptations to infidelity perceive their partner as unfaithful instead—a projection onto the other.

97. Social convention permits a degree of coquetry and flirtation in marriage, and projected jealousy interprets these within the measure of one's own temptations.

98. Delusional jealousy is an acidulated (soured) homosexuality and rightly takes its place among the classical forms of paranoia.

99. Delusional jealousy represents an attempt at defense against an unduly strong homosexual impulse through the formula: "I do not love him—she loves him."

100. In male paranoid delusions, the proposition "I (a man) love him (a man)" is contradicted in various ways producing persecution, erotomania, or jealousy.

101. Male homosexuality frequently develops through the boy remaining fixated on his mother and later identifying with her, seeking objects resembling himself.

102. The homosexual man loves as he wished his mother to love him; his object choice proceeds by way of narcissism toward youth and physical resemblance.

103. Intense jealousy combined with strong homosexual impulses can transform into paranoid persecutory delusions through successive denials and projections.

104. Analysis reveals that behind all these forms of jealousy there is also a mourning-like grief at the loss of an object and the blow to narcissism.

105. The treatment of projected jealousy requires not disputing the patient's evidence but helping them view the situation differently.

I have the research. Here are the position statements:

========================================
THE LOSS OF REALITY IN NEUROSIS AND PSYCHOSIS (1924)
========================================

1. In neurosis, the ego in its dependence on reality suppresses a piece of the id (instinctual life); in psychosis, the ego in service of the id withdraws from a piece of reality.

2. For neurosis the decisive factor is the predominance of the influence of reality; for psychosis it is the predominance of the id.

3. Both neurosis and psychosis involve two steps: in neurosis, the ego first represses an instinctual impulse, then attempts to compensate for the damage to the id.

4. In psychosis, the first step drags the ego away from reality, while the second tries to make good the damage by creating a new reality.

5. Every neurosis disturbs the patient's relation to reality; in its severe forms it signifies a flight from real life.

6. Neurosis does not disavow reality—it only ignores it; psychosis disavows reality and tries to replace it.

7. In neurosis, a piece of reality is avoided by a sort of flight; in psychosis, reality is remodeled.

8. The psychotic reaction to unbearable reality would be a disavowal of the fact itself, whereas the neurotic reaction is repression of the instinctual wish aroused by that fact.

9. The world of phantasy plays the same role in neurosis as the "storeroom" from which materials for the new reality are drawn in psychosis.

10. Normal or healthy behavior combines features of both reactions: it disavows reality as little as neurosis but exerts itself like psychosis to alter that reality through work on the external world.

11. In psychosis, the initial flight from reality is succeeded by an active phase of remodeling; in neurosis, initial obedience is succeeded by a deferred attempt at flight.

12. The newly constructed world of psychosis follows the wishful impulses of the id, while the reason for the break with reality was the frustration of these same wishes.

13. The loss of reality in psychosis affects the perception of external reality; the loss of reality in neurosis affects the relation between ego and id.

14. Delusions and hallucinations in psychosis are attempts to create a substitute reality that better satisfies the id's demands.

========================================
FETISHISM (1927)
========================================

15. The fetish is a substitute for a particular and quite special penis—the mother's phallus which the little boy once believed in and does not want to give up.

16. The boy refuses to take cognizance of the fact that a woman has no penis because this would mean acknowledging that his own possession of a penis is in danger.

17. The fetish is not simply a substitute for any penis but specifically for the mother's penis that the boy believed in and now disavows.

18. In creating a fetish, the boy has retained his belief in the maternal phallus but has also given it up—both attitudes persist side by side.

19. The fetish represents a compromise between the perception of maternal castration and the counter-wish that denies it.

20. The creation of a fetish involves a process akin to the stopping of memory in traumatic amnesia—interest is frozen at the last moment before the traumatic discovery.

21. The fetish is a token of triumph over the threat of castration and a protection against it.

22. The fetish saves the fetishist from becoming homosexual by endowing women with the characteristic that makes them tolerable as sexual objects.

23. The fetishist enjoys an advantage: the fetish is easily accessible, not withheld from him, and he can readily obtain the sexual satisfaction attached to it.

24. Affection and hostility in the treatment of the fetish run parallel with the disavowal and acknowledgment of castration, mixed in varying proportions.

25. Some fetishes represent both the disavowal and the assertion of castration simultaneously—as when a woman's underclothing can be viewed either as castrated or as bearing concealed genitals.

26. In cases involving disavowal, one current of mental life recognizes reality while another simultaneously denies it—producing a split in the ego.

27. The concept of disavowal (Verleugnung) describes the fate of the idea, as distinct from repression (Verdrängung), which describes the fate of the affect.

28. Disavowal is not the same as complete erasure (scotomization); the perception persists but is simultaneously affirmed and denied.

29. Probably no male human being is spared the fright of castration at the sight of a female genital; why some become homosexual, some create fetishes, and most surmount it, we cannot explain.

========================================
MEDUSA'S HEAD (1922)
========================================

30. To decapitate equals to castrate; the terror of Medusa is thus a terror of castration linked to the sight of something.

31. The terrifying decapitated head of Medusa represents the castrated female genital, specifically the mother's genital surrounded by hair.

32. The occasion for castration terror is when a boy catches sight of the female genitals—probably those of an adult, essentially those of his mother.

33. The hair upon Medusa's head, frequently represented as snakes, is derived from the castration complex.

34. Though the snakes are frightening in themselves, they serve to mitigate the horror because they replace the penis whose absence causes the horror.

35. The multiplication of penis symbols (the many snakes) paradoxically signifies castration—this is a technical rule confirmed by the Medusa image.

36. The sight of Medusa's head makes the spectator stiff with terror, turns him to stone—and becoming stiff means an erection.

37. The stiffening offers consolation to the spectator: he is still in possession of a penis, and the erection reassures him of this fact.

38. Displaying the erect penis (or its substitute) is a way of intimidating evil spirits—saying "I am not afraid of you, I defy you, I have a penis."

39. The virgin goddess Athena wears the symbol of horror (Medusa's head) on her dress, thus becoming a woman who is unapproachable and repels all sexual desire.

40. Athena displaying the terrifying genitals of the Mother represents a woman who repels desire because she exhibits the proof of castration.

41. The Greeks, being in the main strongly homosexual, inevitably represented woman as a being who frightens and repels because she is castrated.
