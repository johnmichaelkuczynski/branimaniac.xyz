FRAGMENT OF AN ANALYSIS OF A CASE OF HYSTERIA (DORA, 1905)
1. Hysterical symptoms are the expression of repressed sexual wishes and fantasies.
2. Dreams provide the most direct access to unconscious mental content.
3. Transference is the displacement of feelings originally directed toward earlier figures onto the person of the analyst.
4. Somatic symptoms have symbolic meaning corresponding to unconscious fantasies.
5. Resistance to analytic interpretation indicates proximity to repressed material.
6. Hysteria involves the conversion of psychical excitation into somatic symptoms.
7. Multiple determinants converge in the production of a single hysterical symptom.

ANALYSIS OF A PHOBIA IN A FIVE-YEAR-OLD BOY (LITTLE HANS, 1909)
8. The Oedipus complex is a universal phenomenon in childhood psychosexual development.
9. Phobias result from the displacement of anxiety from an internal source onto an external object.
10. Castration anxiety is central to male psychosexual development.
11. Children spontaneously develop sexual theories to explain procreation and anatomical differences.
12. Animal phobias in childhood represent displaced fear of the father.
13. Infantile sexuality exists and follows developmental stages.
14. The child's sexual researches are driven by the threat posed by a new sibling.

PSYCHO-ANALYTIC NOTES ON AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL ACCOUNT OF A CASE OF PARANOIA (SCHREBER, 1911)
15. Paranoia results from the defense against unconscious homosexual wishes.
16. Projection transforms unacceptable internal perceptions into perceptions of external origin.
17. Delusions are attempts at recovery and reconstruction of the world.
18. Megalomania represents a regression to primary narcissism.
19. The paranoiac's relation to the world is withdrawn and then reconstructed through delusion.
20. The transformation of homosexual love follows the formula: "I do not love him—I hate him—he hates me."
21. Persecutory delusions develop when projected hatred returns as external persecution.

FROM THE HISTORY OF AN INFANTILE NEUROSIS (WOLF MAN, 1918)
22. Infantile neurosis provides the template and nucleus for adult neurosis.
23. The primal scene—real or fantasied observation of parental intercourse—has traumatic significance.
24. Deferred action (Nachträglichkeit) operates such that early experiences acquire pathogenic meaning retroactively.
25. Obsessional neurosis is characterized by profound ambivalence toward the father.
26. Passive sexual aims in relation to the father underlie obsessional symptoms.
27. Phylogenetic inheritance may supply primal fantasies when individual experience is lacking.
28. The wolf dream condenses multiple layers of infantile sexual experience.

ON NARCISSISM: AN INTRODUCTION (1914)
29. Primary narcissism is a normal developmental stage preceding object-love.
30. Libido can be directed toward the ego (ego-libido) or toward external objects (object-libido).
31. The ego-ideal is formed through the internalization of narcissistic perfection.
32. Being in love involves an impoverishment of ego-libido transferred to the object.
33. Narcissistic object-choice is based on what one is, was, wishes to be, or once was part of oneself.
34. The distinction between ego-libido and object-libido is fundamental to libido theory.
35. Megalomania in psychosis represents the return of libido to the ego.

INSTINCTS AND THEIR VICISSITUDES (1915)
36. Instincts (Triebe) operate at the frontier between the mental and the somatic.
37. An instinct has four characteristics: source, aim, object, and impetus.
38. The four vicissitudes of instincts are: reversal into the opposite, turning around upon the subject, repression, and sublimation.
39. Love and hate are not simple opposites deriving from a single instinct.
40. The pleasure-unpleasure polarity is the fundamental regulator of mental life.
41. The transformation from activity to passivity and from sadism to masochism are instinctual reversals.
42. The object of an instinct is its most variable feature.

REPRESSION (1915)
43. Repression is a defense mechanism distinct from and preliminary to conscious condemnation.
44. Primal repression establishes an unconscious nucleus to which later repressions attach.
45. Repression proper (after-pressure) acts on derivatives of the primally repressed.
46. The repressed exerts continuous pressure toward consciousness requiring constant counter-cathexis.
47. Repression acts individually upon each ideational representative.
48. The return of the repressed occurs through symptom formation and other substitute formations.
49. Repression fails when substitute formations become too similar to the repressed content.

THE UNCONSCIOUS (1915)
50. The unconscious constitutes a distinct psychical system governed by its own laws.
51. Primary process—displacement and condensation—characterizes unconscious mental functioning.
52. The unconscious knows no negation, no doubt, and no degrees of certainty.
53. Unconscious processes are timeless and not ordered temporally.
54. Thing-presentations alone characterize the unconscious; word-presentations belong to the preconscious.
55. The censorship between unconscious and preconscious determines what reaches consciousness.
56. Unconscious ideas can only become conscious by linking with corresponding word-presentations.

MOURNING AND MELANCHOLIA (1917)
57. Mourning is the normal reaction to the loss of a loved object.
58. Melancholia involves identification with the lost object through narcissistic regression.
59. In melancholia, the shadow of the object falls upon the ego.
60. Self-reproaches in melancholia are actually reproaches directed at the introjected lost object.
61. Ambivalence toward the lost object is constitutive of the melancholic disposition.
62. The ego splits in melancholia: one part (the ego-ideal) attacks another (the ego identified with the object).
63. Mania represents the triumph of the ego over the lost object following its metabolization.
64. Object-loss may be ideal or unconscious even when the object has not actually died.
