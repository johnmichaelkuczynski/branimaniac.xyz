POSITION STATEMENTS: FREUD - FROM THE HISTORY OF AN INFANTILE NEUROSIS (WOLF MAN, 1918)

1. Infantile neurosis is the precursor and precondition of adult neurosis.
2. The primal scene—witnessing or fantasizing parental intercourse—has pathogenic significance.
3. Deferred action (Nachträglichkeit) means early experiences gain traumatic force only after later development.
4. Animal phobias in childhood represent displaced anxiety concerning the father.
5. The wolf symbolically represents the threatening, castrating father in the unconscious.
6. Passive sexual aims toward the father underlie many neurotic symptoms in men.
7. The choice of the wolf as phobic object is determined by its association with fairy tales and anxiety.
8. Castration anxiety can be activated by the observation of female genitals.
9. Regression to the anal-sadistic phase occurs when genital organization encounters obstacles.
10. Obsessional neurosis develops when repressed sadistic impulses return in the form of self-torture.
11. Bowel disturbances can represent displaced genital sensations and wishes.
12. The fantasy of being beaten by the father represents a regressive substitute for being loved by him.
13. Seduction by an older child or sibling contributes to premature sexual development.
14. The primal scene may be constructed from observations of animal coitus and applied to parents.
15. Religious piety can serve as a sublimation or reaction-formation against sadistic and sexual impulses.
16. Ambivalence toward the father manifests as alternating piety and blasphemous thoughts.
17. The Christmas birthday (rebirth) fantasy represents identification with Christ and the father.
18. Phylogenetic inheritance provides schemata that organize individual experience.
19. The inherited primal fantasies include seduction, castration, and observation of parental intercourse.
20. Intestinal symptoms can represent feminine identification and pregnancy wishes.
21. The fear of being eaten by the wolf represents passive submission to the father.
22. Analysis must reconstruct the infantile neurosis to achieve lasting therapeutic results.
23. Screen memories condense and distort significant childhood experiences.
24. The dream of the wolves staring represents the reversal of the primal scene experience.
25. Stillness and immobility in dreams can represent violent motion through reversal.
