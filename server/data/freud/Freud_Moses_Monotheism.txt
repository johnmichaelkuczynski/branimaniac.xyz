POSITION STATEMENT FREUD MOSES AND MONOTHEISM

1. Moses was not a Hebrew but an Egyptian, likely a nobleman or priest of high rank.

2. The name "Moses" is of Egyptian origin, derived from names like Thut-mose and Ra-mose, meaning "child."

3. Monotheism is not of Jewish origin but an Egyptian discovery, originating with Pharaoh Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV).

4. Akhenaten established monotheism as his state religion in the form of exclusive worship of the sun-power, or Aten.

5. The Aten religion was characterized by exclusive belief in one God, rejection of anthropomorphism, rejection of magic and sorcery, and absolute denial of an afterlife.

6. Moses was a devoted believer in and follower of Akhenaten's Aten religion.

7. After Akhenaten's death and the collapse of Aten worship, Moses fled Egypt to preserve monotheism through a new people.

8. Moses chose the Israelite slaves as a people upon whom he could impose his monotheistic religious beliefs.

9. Moses imposed the Egyptian custom of circumcision upon the Israelites as part of their new religious identity.

10. The fact that Jews practice circumcision—an Egyptian custom—provides evidence that Moses was Egyptian and brought Egyptian religion to them.

11. Because of his tyrannical and domineering character and his desire to impose strict monotheism, Moses was murdered by his followers in a revolt.

12. The biblical account of Moses follows the structure of "the family romance"—a mythic pattern identified by Otto Rank in hero narratives.

13. The standard hero myth involves noble birth, exposure, and rescue by humble parents; Moses's story inverts this, suggesting the historical reality was itself inverted.

14. After Moses's murder, the Israelites repressed the memory of the deed and abandoned much of his strict religion.

15. The Israelites later joined with a Midianite tribe who worshipped a volcano god named Yahweh.

16. The monotheistic solar god Aten of the Egyptian Moses was eventually fused with Yahweh, the Midianite volcano god.

17. The deeds of the Egyptian Moses were ascribed to a Midianite priest also called Moses, creating a composite figure.

18. There is an analogy between collective phenomena in religion and the process of repression in individual development: trauma—defense—latency—neurotic illness—partial return of the repressed.

19. After a significant period of latency (centuries), there was a "return of the repressed" in which the strict ethical monotheism of Moses reasserted itself.

20. The return of the repressed shaped the distinctive character of the Jewish people and brought Judaism to its spiritual and ethical heights.

21. Repressed collective guilt stemming from the murder of Moses was passed down through generations.

22. This inherited guilt led Jews to neurotic expressions of legalistically religious sentiment to cope with their inheritance of trauma.

23. The Jewish prophets kept alive the sense of guilt, leading to the imposition of ever more instinctual renunciations.

24. These renunciations resulted in "ethical heights which had remained inaccessible to the other peoples of antiquity."

25. The concept of the Messiah emerged as a hope for the return of Moses—a desire for reconnection with the murdered father figure.

26. Jewish identity and character traits are transmitted phylogenetically and do not require religion to be sustained.

27. The concept of "the chosen people" catalyzes a collective narcissistic neurosis that contributes to anti-Semitism.

28. The hatred Jews have attracted is the price paid for the denial of parricide and the refusal to acknowledge it.

29. Christianity emerged as a way for humanity to deal with the sense of guilt arising from the murder of Moses (and the primal father).

30. The crucifixion of Jesus was a way to acknowledge and atone for original sin—which was actually the murder of the primal father.

31. Original sin, in its deepest meaning, refers to parricide—the killing of the primal father.

32. The Holy Communion represents the totem feast described in Totem and Taboo—the ritual consumption of the murdered father.

33. In Christianity, guilt (original sin) and parricide are recognized and assumed; in Judaism, parricide is not recognized but reappears in the feeling of guilt.

34. Christianity represents a "son religion" that replaced the "father religion" of Judaism.

35. Christianity acknowledged the killing of God (in Christ), while Judaism continues to deny the murder of Moses.

36. The Jewish religion exhibits "the progress of spirituality" (Fortschritt in der Geistigkeit)—an advance in intellectuality.

37. This advance in intellectuality is connected to the ban on idolatry and the dematerialization of God in monotheism.

38. The prohibition against making images of God represents a triumph of abstract thought over sensory perception.

39. The recognition of paternity over maternity represents a similar triumph of intellectuality—the father cannot be perceived directly but must be inferred.

40. One man, Moses, created the Jews; to him they owe their tenacity in life and much of the hostility they have encountered.

41. The distinctive character and survival of the Jewish people can be explained by the legacy of strict Mosaic monotheism.

42. Religions owe their compulsive power to the return of the repressed; they are reawakened memories of ancient traumatic events.

43. The structure of individual neurosis applies to the development of religious and cultural phenomena.

44. The sense of guilt that results from repression and renunciation of instincts is the foundation of civilization's development.

45. Moses and Monotheism represents a psychoanalytic history of the Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish psyche.

46. The work applies the interpretive methods used in individual psychoanalysis to reconstruct collective historical events.

47. Anti-Semitism is partly explained by the envy aroused by the Jewish claim to be the "chosen people."

48. Anti-Semitism is also connected to the fact that Jews have lived as minorities among other peoples.

49. Circumcision evokes castration anxiety in non-Jews, contributing to anti-Semitic sentiment.

50. The Jewish people have attracted "undying hatred" that is intimately related to their advance in spirituality and ethical monotheism.
