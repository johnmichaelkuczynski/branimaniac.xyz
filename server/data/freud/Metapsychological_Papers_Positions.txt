POSITION STATEMENTS: FREUD - METAPSYCHOLOGICAL PAPERS (1914-1917)

================================================================================

ON NARCISSISM: AN INTRODUCTION (1914)

29. Primary narcissism is a normal developmental stage preceding object-love.

30. Libido can be directed toward the ego (ego-libido) or toward external objects (object-libido).

31. The ego-ideal is formed through the internalization of narcissistic perfection.

32. Being in love involves an impoverishment of ego-libido transferred to the object.

33. Narcissistic object-choice is based on what one is, was, wishes to be, or once was part of oneself.

34. The distinction between ego-libido and object-libido is fundamental to libido theory.

35. Megalomania in psychosis represents the return of libido to the ego.

================================================================================

INSTINCTS AND THEIR VICISSITUDES (1915)

36. Instincts (Triebe) operate at the frontier between the mental and the somatic.

37. An instinct has four characteristics: source, aim, object, and impetus.

38. The four vicissitudes of instincts are: reversal into the opposite, turning around upon the subject, repression, and sublimation.

39. Love and hate are not simple opposites deriving from a single instinct.

40. The pleasure-unpleasure polarity is the fundamental regulator of mental life.

41. The transformation from activity to passivity and from sadism to masochism are instinctual reversals.

42. The object of an instinct is its most variable feature.

================================================================================

REPRESSION (1915)

43. Repression is a defense mechanism distinct from and preliminary to conscious condemnation.

44. Primal repression establishes an unconscious nucleus to which later repressions attach.

45. Repression proper (after-pressure) acts on derivatives of the primally repressed.

46. The repressed exerts continuous pressure toward consciousness requiring constant counter-cathexis.

47. Repression acts individually upon each ideational representative.

48. The return of the repressed occurs through symptom formation and other substitute formations.

49. Repression fails when substitute formations become too similar to the repressed content.

================================================================================

THE UNCONSCIOUS (1915)

50. The unconscious constitutes a distinct psychical system governed by its own laws.

51. Primary process—displacement and condensation—characterizes unconscious mental functioning.

52. The unconscious knows no negation, no doubt, and no degrees of certainty.

53. Unconscious processes are timeless and not ordered temporally.

54. Thing-presentations alone characterize the unconscious; word-presentations belong to the preconscious.

55. The censorship between unconscious and preconscious determines what reaches consciousness.

56. Unconscious ideas can only become conscious by linking with corresponding word-presentations.

================================================================================

MOURNING AND MELANCHOLIA (1917)

57. Mourning is the normal reaction to the loss of a loved object.

58. Melancholia involves identification with the lost object through narcissistic regression.

59. In melancholia, the shadow of the object falls upon the ego.

60. Self-reproaches in melancholia are actually reproaches directed at the introjected lost object.

61. Ambivalence toward the lost object is constitutive of the melancholic disposition.

62. The ego splits in melancholia: one part (the ego-ideal) attacks another (the ego identified with the object).

63. Mania represents the triumph of the ego over the lost object following its metabolization.

64. Object-loss may be ideal or unconscious even when the object has not actually died.
