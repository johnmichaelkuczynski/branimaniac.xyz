**POSITION STATEMENTS - FREUD: PROJECT FOR A SCIENTIFIC PSYCHOLOGY (1895)**

1. The aim of psychology as a natural science is to represent psychical processes as quantitatively determined states of specifiable material particles (neurons).

2. What distinguishes mental activity from rest is to be regarded as a quantity (Q) subject to the general laws of motion.

3. The material particles in question that carry psychical quantity are the neurons.

4. The principle of neuronic inertia asserts that neurons tend to divest themselves of quantity—the nervous system seeks to reduce tension to zero.

5. Reflex movement is an established method for neurons to discharge quantity and keep themselves free from stimulus.

6. The neuronic system receives endogenous stimuli from the body itself which give rise to the major needs: hunger, respiration, and sexuality.

7. The organism cannot withdraw from endogenous stimuli as it does from external stimuli; they only cease when specific conditions are realized in the external world.

8. The neuronic system must abandon its original trend toward inertia and learn to tolerate a store of quantity sufficient to meet the demands for specific action (the exigencies of life).

9. There are two classes of neurons: permeable neurons (φ) which serve perception and retain nothing, and impermeable neurons (ψ) which offer resistance, retain quantity, and are the vehicles of memory and psychical processes.

10. Memory is represented by the facilitations (Bahnung) existing between the ψ-neurons—the differences in the degree to which contact-barriers have been made more capable of conduction.

11. Facilitation depends on the quantity that passes through a neuron in the excitatory process and on the number of repetitions of that process.

12. One chief characteristic of nervous tissue is memory: a susceptibility to permanent alteration by a single process, contrasted with the behavior of material that returns to its former condition.

13. Pain consists in the irruption of large quantities into ψ—it sets both the φ-system and the ψ-system in motion and is the most imperative of all processes.

14. Pain leaves behind permanent facilitations in ψ—like a stroke of lightning—that may do away entirely with the resistance of contact-barriers.

15. The perceptual neurons (ω) are excited along with the others during perception but not during reproduction; their states of excitation give rise to conscious sensations—qualities.

16. The sense organs operate not only as screens against quantity but as sieves, only letting through stimuli with particular periods.

17. Unpleasure coincides with a rise in the level of quantity in ψ; pleasure is the sensation of discharge.

18. A few minutes after taking in a stimulus, one experiences exhilaration; the psychic effect consists of euphoria which does not differ from the normal euphoria of a healthy person.

19. The experience of satisfaction occurs when an extraneous helper carries out specific action in the external world on behalf of the helpless subject.

20. The original helplessness of human beings is the primal source of all moral motives.

21. The experience of satisfaction leads to facilitation between the memory-image of the object and the nuclear neurons cathected during the state of urgency.

22. When the state of wishing reappears, the cathexis will pass to the memories and activate them; the memory-image of the object will be the first to experience wishful activation.

23. Wishful activation in the first instance produces something similar to a perception—namely, a hallucination.

24. The experience of pain produces in ψ a large rise in the level of quantity felt as unpleasure, an inclination to discharge, and a facilitation between this inclination and the memory-image of the pain-giving object.

25. A wishful state produces positive attraction to the object of the wish; an experience of pain results in repulsion—a disinclination to keep the hostile memory-image cathected. These are primary wishful attraction and primary defense.

26. The ego is defined as the totality of ψ-cathexes at any given time; in these a permanent portion may be distinguished from a changing one.

27. A lateral cathexis from a neighboring neuron acts as an inhibition on the passage of quantity—the ego can inhibit psychical processes.

28. With help of a mechanism that draws the ego's attention to an imminent fresh cathexis of a hostile memory-image, the ego can inhibit the passage of quantity from the memory to the release of unpleasure.

29. Wishful cathexis carried to the point of hallucination and complete generation of unpleasure involving complete expenditure of defense are psychical primary processes.

30. Processes only made possible by a good cathexis of the ego, which represent a moderation of primary processes, are psychical secondary processes.

31. The secondary process requires correct exploitation of indications of reality, which is only possible when there is inhibition on the part of the ego.

32. It is the inhibition brought about by the ego that makes possible a criterion for distinguishing between a perception and a memory.

33. Judgement is a ψ-process only made possible by inhibition exercised by the ego, brought about by the difference between wishful cathexis of a memory and a similar perceptual cathexis.

34. Language describes the constant portion of the perceptual complex as a "thing" and the inconstant portion as its activity or attribute—its "predicate."

35. Judging is not a primary process; it presupposes a cathexis from the ego of the disparate portion of the complex.

36. It is on his fellow-creatures that a human being first learns to cognize—the fellow human-being was the subject's first satisfying object, first hostile object, and sole assisting force.

37. What we term "things" are residues that have evaded judgement.

38. The thought-process consists of the cathexis of ψ-neurons accompanied by a change in the previously operative facilitations brought about by lateral cathexis from the ego.

39. The secondary process is a repetition of the original course of excitation in ψ, but at a lower level and with smaller quantities.

40. The essential precondition of sleep is a lowering of the endogenous charge in the ψ-nucleus, which renders the secondary function unnecessary.

41. In sleep the subject is in the ideal state of inertia, with the store of quantity discharged.

42. The will is the discharge of the total ψ-quantity.

43. Dreams are devoid of motor discharge; we are paralyzed in dreams because the neurons are uncathected and motor excitation cannot pass over the barriers.

44. In dreams the compulsion to associate prevails—two cathexes simultaneously present must be brought into connection with each other.

45. The purpose and meaning of normal dreams can be established with certainty: dreams are the fulfilments of wishes—primary processes following on experiences of satisfaction.

46. Consciousness is not restricted to the ego but can be attached to any ψ-process—this is a warning against identification of primary processes with unconscious ones.

47. The psychical course of excitation in dreams takes place in accordance with quantity, but it is not quantity that decides what shall become conscious.

48. Consciousness emerges during the passage of a quantity; it is not aroused by a constant cathexis.

49. An intense current of quantity is not favorable to the emergence of consciousness; consciousness is attached to the outcome of the current—to a comparatively quiescent persistence of cathexis.

50. The meaning of dreams as wish-fulfilments is concealed by a number of ψ-processes which are characteristic of the pathological nature of neuroses.
