contained 
in 
Marxism

were 
delivered 
at 
the 
San 
Francisco 
Public 
Library, 
June 
23–July 
3, 
1952, 
under 
the 
sponsorship 
of 
The 
Freeman 
magazine. 
They 
were 
taken 
down, 
word

She 
has 
very 
kindly 
made 
these 
lectures 
available 
to 
the 
Foundation 
for 
Economic 
Education 
for 
publication. 
Mrs. 
Greaves 
worked 
as 
a 
senior 
staff 
member 
at 
FEE 
for 
practically 
50 
years, 
only 
retiring 
in 
1999. 
Along 
with 
her 
late 
husband, 
Percy 
L. 
Greaves, 
Jr., 
she 
was 
a 
long-time 
friend 
and 
associate 
of 
Ludwig 
von 
Mises. 
Indeed, 
there 
are 
few 
people 
in 
the 
world 
today 
who 
are 
as 
conversant 
with 
Mises’s 
ideas 
and 
writings 
as 
she. 


The

INTRODUCTION 


by 
Richard 
M. 
Ebeling 


AUSTRIAN 
ECONOMIST 
LUDWIG 
VON 
MISES 
delivered 
these 
nine 
lectures, 
which 
we 
have 
titled 
Marxism 
Unmasked, 
from 
June 
23 
to 
July 
3, 
1952, 
in 
San 
Francisco 
at 
a 
seminar 
sponsored 
by 
The 
Freeman. 
Ahistory 
teacher 
who 
received 
a 
scholarship 
to 
attend 
the 
program 
later 
wrote 
to 
the 
magazine 
to 
say: 


The 
lectures 
themselves 
I 
found 
provocative, 
stimulating 
and 
highly 
rewarding. 
As 
a 
classic 
exposition 
of 
the 
virtues 
of 
individualism 
and 
the 
evils 
of 
socialism, 
buttressed 
with 
an 
impressive 
array 
of 
scholarship, 
they 
were 
unmatched.... 
I 
am 
not 
trying 
to 
say 
that 
I 
became 
converted 
completely 
to 
the 
set 
of 
ideas 
that 
Dr. 
Mises 
and 
the 
Freeman 
represent. 
But 
I 
do 
say 
that 
any 
student 
or 
teacher 
of 
the 
social 
sciences 
who 
fails 
to 
think 
deeply 
on 
these 
ideas 
is 
negligent 
and 
ill-informed, 
if 
not 
worse. 
This 
feeling 
the 
seminar 
did 
leave 
me 
with. 
Certainly 
I 
personally 
appreciate 
some 
of 
these 
ideas 
far 
more 
than 
I 
did 
a 
month 
ago.1 


It 
is 
worth 
recalling 
the 
state 
of 
the 
world 
in 
1952 
when 
Ludwig 
von 
Mises 
gave 
these 
lectures. 
Everywhere 
around 
the 
globe 
Soviet 
socialism 
seemed 
to 
be 
on 
the 
march. 
World 
War 
II 
had 
left 
all 
of 
Eastern 
Europe 
in 
the 
grip 
of 
the 
Soviet 
Union. 
In 
1949, 
mainland 
China 
had 
fallen 
under 
the 
control 
of 
Mao 
Zedong’s 
communist 
armies. 
In 
June 
of 
1950 
the 
Korean 
War 
had 
broken 
out, 
and 
in 
1952 
American 
armies 
under 
the 
UN 
flag 
were 
in 
a 
bloody 
stalemate 
along 
the 
38th 
parallel 
against 
the 
forces 
of 
North 
Korea 
and 
Communist 
China. 
The 
French 
were 
immersed 
in 
a 
seemingly 
endless 
colonial 
conflict 
in 
Indochina 
against 
Ho 
Chi 
Minh’s 
communist 
guerrilla 
army. 


In 
the 
West, 
large 
numbers 
of 
intellectuals 
were 
persuaded 
that 
“history” 
was 
inescapably 
on 
the 
side 
of 
socialism, 
under 
the 
leadership 
Comrade 
Stalin 
in 
the 
Kremlin. 
Communist 
parties 
in 
France 
and 
Italy 
had 
large 



memberships, 
and 
followed 
every 
ideological 
twist 
and 
turn 
made 
by 
Moscow. 
Even 
many 
of 
those 
who 
rejected 
the 
brutality 
of 
Soviet-style 
socialism 
still 
believed 
that 
economic 
planning 
was 
inevitable. 
A 
prominent 
political 
scientist 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Chicago 
even 
declared 
in 
1950 
that 
“Planning 
is 
coming. 
Of 
this 
there 
can 
be 
no 
doubt. 
The 
only 
question 
is 
whether 
it 
will 
be 
the 
democratic 
planning 
of 
a 
free 
society, 
or 
totalitarian 
in 
character.”2 


In 
both 
Europe 
and 
the 
United 
States 
it 
was 
presumed 
that 
capitalism, 
when 
left 
unregulated, 
could 
only 
lead 
to 
exploitation, 
misery, 
and 
social 
injustice. 
Governments 
on 
both 
sides 
of 
the 
Atlantic 
were 
introducing 
ever 
more 
stringent 
interventionist 
and 
welfare 
statist 
policies 
meant 
to 
ameliorate 
the 
supposed 
cruelty 
of 
the 
market 
economy. 
And 
because 
of 
the 
“emergency” 
of 
the 
Korean 
War, 
the 
U.S. 
government 
had 
further 
burdened 
the 
American 
people 
with 
a 
comprehensive 
system 
of 
wage 
and 
price 
controls 
that 
hampered 
almost 
every 
aspect 
of 
economic 
activity.3 


The 
primary 
source 
and 
impetus 
for 
the 
global 
bias 
toward 
socialism 
were 
the 
writings 
of 
Karl 
Marx 
(1818–1883). 
He 
claimed 
to 
have 
discovered 
the 
invariant 
“laws” 
of 
human 
historical 
development 
that 
would 
lead 
to 
the 
demise 
of 
capitalism 
and 
the 
triumph 
of 
socialism, 
followed 
by 
a 
final 
transition 
to 
a 
blissful, 
post-scarcity 
communist 
world. 
During 
the 
intermediary 
socialist 
stage 
leading 
to 
communism, 
Marx 
declared, 
there 
would 
be 
a 
“revolutionary 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat.” 
It 
would 
prevent 
remnants 
of 
the 
old 
capitalist 
ruling 
class 
from 
trying 
to 
return 
to 
power 
and 
would 
“reeducate” 
the 
workers 
into 
a 
“higher 
consciousness” 
free 
from 
the 
residues 
of 
the 
prior 
bourgeois 
mentality.4 


What 
makes 
this 
entire 
process 
inescapable 
and 
irreversible, 
Marx 
insisted, 
is 
that 
the 
physical 
means 
of 
production 
follow 
technological 
transformations 
in 
a 
series 
of 
historical 
stages 
that 
are 
beyond 
man’s 
control. 
Each 
of 
these 
stages 
of 
transformation 
requires 
a 
particular 
set 
of 
human 
institutional 
relationships 
for 
the 
full 
blossoming 
of 
that 
technology’s 
potential. 
What 
men, 
in 
their 
limited 
and 
subjective 
views 
of 
the 
world, 
take 
to 
be 
the 
invariant 
foundations 
of 
human 
life—morality, 
family, 
property, 
religious 
faith, 
customs 
and 
traditions, 
and 
so 
on—are 
merely 
the 
temporary 
elements 
of 
a 
societal 
“superstructure” 
serving 
the 
ends 
of 
the 
objective 
material 
forces 
of 
production 
during 
each 
of 
these 
historical 
epochs. 
Therefore, 
even 
man’s 
“consciousness” 
about 
himself 
and 
the 
world 
around 
him 
is 
a 
product 
of 
his 
particular 
place 
and 
role 
in 
this 
process 
of 
historical 



evolution.5 


Every 
man’s 
“class” 
position 
in 
society, 
according 
to 
Marx, 
is 
determined 
by 
his 
relationship 
to 
the 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
Those 
who 
own 
the 
means 
of 
production 
in 
capitalist 
society 
must, 
by 
historical 
necessity, 
“exploit” 
the 
others 
who 
offer 
their 
labor 
services 
to 
them 
for 
hire. 
The 
capitalist 
class 
lives 
off 
the 
labor 
of 
the 
working 
class 
by 
expropriating 
as 
“profit” 
a 
part 
of 
what 
the 
laborers 
in 
their 
employ 
have 
produced. 
Hence, 
these 
two 
social 
classes 
are 
in 
irreconcilable 
conflict 
with 
each 
other 
for 
the 
material 
rewards 
of 
human 
labor. 
This 
conflict 
reaches 
its 
climax 
with 
the 
violent 
overthrow 
of 
the 
exploiters 
by 
the 
proletariat, 
who 
experience 
an 
increasing 
economic 
misery 
during 
the 
final 
death 
throes 
of 
the 
capitalist 
system.6 


In 
the 
new 
socialist 
order 
that 
replaces 
capitalism, 
the 
means 
of 
production 
will 
be 
nationalized 
and 
centrally 
planned 
for 
the 
economic 
betterment 
of 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
humanity, 
and 
no 
longer 
will 
be 
used 
only 
for 
the 
profit-oriented 
benefit 
of 
the 
capitalist 
property 
owners. 
Economic 
planning 
will 
generate 
material 
prosperity 
far 
exceeding 
anything 
experienced 
under 
capitalism; 
technological 
advances 
and 
rising 
production 
will 
not 
only 
eliminate 
poverty 
but 
also 
push 
society 
to 
a 
level 
of 
material 
abundance 
at 
which 
all 
physical 
wants 
and 
worries 
will 
be 
a 
thing 
of 
the 
past. 
This 
final 
stage 
of 
communism 
will 
create 
a 
paradise 
on 
earth 
for 
all 
mankind.7 


Ludwig 
von 
Mises 
as 
Critic 
of 
Socialism 


There 
were 
many 
critics 
of 
socialism 
and 
Marxism 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
and 
early 
twentieth 
centuries. 
One 
of 
the 
most 
outstanding 
was 
the 
French 
economist 
Paul 
Leroy-Beaulieu, 
who 
in 
1885 
penned 
an 
extremely 
insightful 
and 
devastating 
analysis 
of 
collectivism, 
addressing 
its 
dangers 
to 
both 
personal 
liberty 
and 
economic 
prosperity.8 
In 
1896 
one 
of 
Ludwig 
von 
Mises’s 
own 
professors 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Vienna, 
the 
internationally 
renowned 
Austrian 
economist 
Eugen 
von 
Böhm-Bawerk, 
published 
the 
most 
damaging 
critique 
of 
Marx’s 
labor 
theory 
of 
value 
and 
the 
accompanying 
idea 
of 
exploitation 
of 
labor 
under 
capitalism.9 
There 
were 
even 
highly 
effective 
anti-utopian 
novels 
that 
depicted 
the 
disastrous 
effects 
to 
be 
expected 
if 
a 
socialist 
regime 
were 
to 
come 
to 
power 
and 
impose 
central 
planning 
on 
society.10 


But 
none 
of 
these 
writers 
was 
as 
penetrating 
in 
demonstrating 
the 



inherent 
unworkability 
of 
a 
system 
of 
socialist 
central 
planning 
as 
Ludwig 
von 
Mises. 
During 
World 
War 
I 
and 
its 
immediate 
aftermath 
there 
was 
an 
enthusiastic 
confidence 
that 
the 
age 
of 
government 
planning 
had 
finally 
arrived. 
The 
wartime 
price 
and 
wage 
controls 
and 
production 
planning 
boards 
imposed 
in 
virtually 
all 
the 
belligerent 
nations 
were 
considered 
by 
many 
the 
precursors 
of 
continued 
peacetime 
planning. 
Following 
the 
Bolshevik 
Revolution 
in 
Russia 
in 
1917, 
Lenin’s 
Marxist 
regime 
imposed 
“war 
communism” 
in 
1918, 
heralding 
it 
not 
only 
as 
an 
emergency 
device 
to 
fight 
the 
anti-communist 
White 
armies 
during 
the 
three-year 
civil 
war 
in 
Russia, 
but 
also 
as 
the 
great 
leap 
into 
the 
fully 
planned 
society. 
And 
following 
the 
end 
of 
the 
war 
in 
November 
1918, 
new 
Social 
Democratic 
Party 
governments 
in 
Germany 
and 
Austria 
declared 
that 
the 
time 
for 
“socialization” 
and 
economic 
planning 
had 
finally 
arrived.11 


In 
1919, 
at 
a 
meeting 
of 
the 
Austrian 
Economic 
Society, 
Mises 
delivered 
a 
paper 
on 
“Economic 
Calculation 
in 
the 
Socialist 
Commonwealth,” 
which 
was 
published 
in 
a 
leading 
German-language 
journal 
in 
1920.12 
He 
incorporated 
this 
article 
as 
the 
centerpiece 
in 
a 
comprehensive 
treatise 
on 
collectivism 
that 
he 
published 
two 
years 
later 
in 
1922, 
titled 
Socialism: 
An 
Economic 
and 
Sociological 
Analysis 
in 
its 
English 
translation.13 


Mises 
observed 
that 
most 
of 
the 
earlier 
critics 
of 
socialism 
had 
rightly 
pointed 
out 
that 
a 
system 
of 
comprehensive 
government 
planning 
of 
economic 
affairs 
would 
create 
the 
worst 
tyranny 
ever 
experienced 
in 
human 
history. 
With 
all 
production, 
employment, 
and 
distribution 
of 
output 
completely 
under 
the 
monopoly 
control 
of 
the 
State, 
the 
fate 
and 
fortune 
of 
every 
individual 
would 
be 
at 
the 
mercy 
of 
the 
political 
authority. 
In 
addition, 
these 
earlier 
opponents 
of 
socialism 
had 
cogently 
argued 
that 
with 
the 
end 
of 
private 
property 
and 
freedom 
of 
enterprise, 
individuals 
would 
lose 
much 
of 
the 
self-interested 
motivation 
for 
industry, 
innovation, 
and 
work 
effort 
that 
exists 
in 
a 
market 
economy. 


But, 
Mises 
said, 
what 
had 
not 
been 
thoroughly 
examined 
and 
challenged 
was 
whether 
a 
socialist 
economic 
system 
was 
even 
workable 
in 
practice. 
In 
other 
words, 
would 
the 
socialist 
central 
planners 
be 
able 
to 
rationally 
and 
efficiently 
manage 
the 
everyday 
affairs 
of 
economic 
life? 
His 
answer 
was 
no. 
In 
the 
market 
economy 
production 
is 
guided 
by 
the 
expected 
consumer 
demand 
of 
the 
buying 
public. 
Businessmen 
and 
entrepreneurs, 
in 
the 
quest 
to 
earn 
profits 
and 
avoid 
losses, 
must 
direct 
the 
resources 
at 
their 
disposal 
in 
a 
way 
that 
minimizes 
their 
costs 
of 
production 
relative 
to 
the 
expected 
revenues 



from 
supplying 
goods 
and 
services 
that 
consumers 
want 
to 
purchase. 


Money 
prices 
for 
both 
finished 
consumer 
goods 
and 
the 
means 
of 
production 
facilitate 
the 
process. 
The 
prices 
for 
consumer 
goods 
tell 
entrepreneurs 
what 
consumers 
want. 
The 
prices 
for 
the 
means 
of 
production 
—land, 
labor, 
and 
capital—tell 
them 
the 
costs 
of 
producing 
those 
goods 
with 
different 
types 
of 
resources 
and 
raw 
materials 
in 
different 
combinations. 
The 
entrepreneur’s 
task 
is 
to 
select 
that 
resource 
“mix” 
that 
minimizes 
the 
expense 
of 
bringing 
goods 
to 
market 
in 
the 
quantities 
and 
qualities 
demanded 
by 
consumers. 


The 
price 
attached 
to 
any 
one 
of 
those 
resources 
(whether 
it 
be 
land, 
labor, 
or 
capital) 
reflects 
its 
value 
in 
alternative 
uses, 
as 
represented 
by 
the 
competing 
bids 
to 
purchase 
or 
hire 
it 
by 
rival 
entrepreneurs 
who 
also 
seek 
to 
employ 
it 
for 
some 
production 
purpose 
in 
the 
market. 
Unless 
the 
expected 
price 
for 
the 
finished 
good 
is 
able 
to 
cover 
the 
costs 
necessary 
to 
employ 
a 
variety 
of 
resources 
to 
produce 
it, 
it 
is 
uneconomical—wasteful—to 
devote 
those 
resources 
for 
its 
manufacture. 
As 
Mises 
later 
explained 
in 
his 
book 
on 
Bureaucracy, 
“To 
the 
entrepreneur 
of 
capitalist 
society 
a 
factor 
of 
production 
through 
its 
price 
sends 
out 
a 
warning: 
Don’t 
touch 
me, 
I 
am 
earmarked 
for 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
another, 
more 
urgent 
need” 
of 
the 
consuming 
public.14 


This 
means 
that 
the 
price 
system 
of 
a 
competitive 
free 
market 
tends 
to 
assure 
that 
the 
scarce 
resources 
of 
society 
are 
allocated 
and 
used 
in 
a 
way 
that 
best 
reflects 
the 
wants 
and 
desires 
of 
all 
of 
us 
in 
our 
roles 
as 
consumers. 
Since 
one 
of 
the 
inescapable 
elements 
of 
the 
world 
in 
which 
we 
live 
is 
constant 
change, 
every 
shift 
in 
consumer 
demand 
and 
every 
modification 
in 
the 
availability 
and 
uses 
of 
those 
scarce 
resources 
are 
reflected 
in 
changes 
in 
the 
market 
structure 
of 
relative 
prices. 
Such 
changes 
in 
the 
structure 
of 
market 
prices 
provide 
new 
information 
to 
both 
producers 
and 
consumers 
that 
they 
may 
have 
to 
adjust 
their 
buying, 
selling, 
and 
production 
decisions, 
given 
the 
new 
circumstances. 


Mises’s 
challenge 
to 
the 
socialists 
was 
to 
argue 
that 
this 
“rationality” 
of 
the 
market, 
which 
constantly 
coordinated 
selling 
prices 
with 
cost-prices, 
and 
supply 
with 
demand, 
would 
be 
totally 
absent 
under 
a 
system 
of 
central 
planning. 
Prices 
emerge 
out 
of 
the 
buying 
and 
selling 
of 
the 
market 
participants. 
But 
buying 
and 
selling 
are 
only 
possible 
with 
the 
institution 
of 
private 
property, 
under 
which 
goods 
and 
resources 
are 
owned, 
used, 
and 
transferred 
through 
voluntary 
exchange 
at 
the 
discretion 
of 
the 
owners. 


Furthermore, 
under 
capitalism 
the 
complex 
network 
of 
market 



transactions 
is 
made 
possible 
through 
the 
use 
of 
a 
commonly 
accepted 
medium 
of 
exchange—money. 
With 
all 
goods 
and 
resources 
bought 
and 
sold 
in 
the 
market 
through 
a 
medium 
of 
exchange, 
their 
respective 
exchange 
values 
are 
all 
expressed 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
same 
common 
denominator: 
their 
money 
prices. 
This 
common 
denominator 
of 
money 
prices 
enables 
the 
process 
of 
“economic 
calculation,” 
i.e., 
the 
comparing 
of 
relative 
costs 
with 
selling 
prices. 


The 
primary 
goal 
of 
practically 
all 
socialists 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
and 
most 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century 
was 
the 
abolition 
of 
private 
property, 
market 
competition, 
and 
money 
prices. 
In 
their 
place, 
the 
State 
would 
nationalize 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
and 
as 
the 
“trustee” 
of 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
“working 
class” 
would 
centrally 
plan 
all 
of 
society’s 
economic 
activities. 
The 
central 
planning 
agency 
would 
determine 
what 
got 
produced, 
how 
and 
where 
it 
was 
produced, 
and 
then 
distribute 
the 
resulting 
output 
to 
the 
members 
of 
the 
new 
“workers’ 
paradise.” 


Mises 
showed 
that 
the 
end 
of 
private 
property 
would 
mean 
the 
end 
to 
economic 
rationality. 
Without 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
—and 
no 
competitive 
market 
upon 
which 
rival 
entrepreneurs 
could 
bid 
for 
those 
resources 
based 
on 
their 
profit-motivated 
estimates 
of 
their 
respective 
values 
in 
producing 
goods 
desired 
by 
the 
consuming 
public—there 
would 
be 
no 
way 
to 
know 
real 
and 
actual 
opportunity 
costs 
among 
the 
potential 
alternative 
uses 
for 
which 
they 
might 
be 
applied. 
How, 
therefore, 
would 
the 
central 
planners 
know 
whether 
or 
not 
they 
were 
misusing 
and 
wasting 
the 
resources 
of 
society 
in 
their 
production 
decisions? 
As 
Mises 
summarized 
the 
dilemma, 
“It 
is 
not 
an 
advantage 
to 
be 
ignorant 
of 
whether 
or 
not 
what 
one 
is 
doing 
is 
a 
suitable 
means 
of 
attaining 
the 
ends 
sought. 
A 
socialist 
management 
would 
be 
like 
a 
man 
forced 
to 
spend 
his 
life 
blindfolded.”15 


Even 
if 
a 
socialist 
system 
were 
not 
controlled 
by 
brutal 
dictators 
but 
instead 
by 
human 
“angels” 
who 
only 
wanted 
to 
do 
“good” 
for 
humanity, 
and 
even 
if 
the 
incentives 
for 
work 
and 
industry 
were 
not 
reduced 
or 
eliminated 
through 
the 
abolition 
of 
private 
property, 
Mises 
was 
able 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
the 
very 
institutional 
structure 
of 
a 
socialist 
regime 
made 
it 
impossible 
for 
it 
to 
produce 
a 
material 
“heaven 
on 
earth” 
for 
mankind 
superior 
to 
the 
productive 
and 
innovative 
efficiency 
of 
a 
functioning 
free-market 
economy.16 
It 
is 
what 
enabled 
Mises 
to 
declare 
in 
the 
early 
1930s, 
when 
the 
appeal 
of 
socialist 
planning 
around 
the 
world 
was 
reaching 
its 
zenith, 
that, 
“From 
the 
standpoint 
of 
both 
politics 
and 
history, 
this 
proof 
is 
certainly 
the 
most 



important 
discovery 
made 
by 
economic 
theory.... 
It 
alone 
will 
enable 
future 
historians 
to 
understand 
how 
it 
came 
about 
that 
the 
victory 
of 
the 
socialist 
movement 
did 
not 
lead 
to 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
socialist 
order 
of 
society.”17 


Mises’s 
San 
Francisco 
Lectures 


Mises 
believed 
that 
any 
comprehensive 
critique 
of 
socialism 
had 
to 
deal 
with 
more 
than 
merely 
its 
unworkability 
as 
an 
economic 
system, 
however 
central 
this 
was 
to 
the 
case 
against 
socialism. 
It 
was 
also 
necessary 
to 
challenge 
and 
refute 
the 
philosophical 
and 
political 
underpinnings 
of 
the 
socialist 
and 
Marxian 
conceptions 
of 
man 
and 
society. 
His 
1922 
book 
on 
Socialism 
attempted 
to 
do 
this 
in 
great 
detail. 
And 
he 
returned 
to 
this 
theme 
a 
few 
years 
after 
he 
delivered 
these 
lectures 
in 
San 
Francisco 
in 
his 
work 
on 
Theory 
and 
History.18 


What 
Mises 
offered 
those 
attending 
these 
lectures 
in 
late 
June 
and 
early 
July 
of 
1952 
was 
a 
clear 
understanding 
and 
insight 
into 
the 
fundamental 
errors 
and 
misconceptions 
to 
be 
found 
in 
Marx’s 
theories 
of 
dialectical 
materialism 
and 
class 
warfare, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
historical 
analysis 
of 
the 
real 
benefits 
from 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution 
that 
coincided 
with 
the 
emergence 
of 
modern 
capitalist 
society. 
He 
also 
explains 
the 
role 
of 
savings, 
investment, 
and 
the 
profit 
and 
loss 
system 
as 
the 
engines 
for 
economic 
and 
cultural 
progress, 
and 
which 
have 
helped 
eliminate 
the 
poverty 
that 
has 
plagued 
mankind 
through 
most 
of 
history. 


In 
an 
especially 
insightful 
lecture, 
Mises 
discusses 
the 
nature 
and 
workings 
of 
capital 
markets 
and 
the 
importance 
of 
market-based 
interest 
rates 
free 
from 
government 
manipulation 
and 
inflation. 
In 
addition, 
he 
shows 
that 
foreign 
investment 
in 
underdeveloped 
parts 
of 
the 
world 
have 
not 
been 
the 
cause 
of 
poverty 
or 
exploitation, 
as 
socialists 
have 
constantly 
claimed, 
but 
the 
source 
of 
accelerated 
prosperity 
and 
human 
improvement 
for 
tens 
of 
millions 
of 
people 
in 
these 
countries. 


All 
of 
these 
arguments 
and 
analyses 
are 
placed 
in 
the 
wider 
context 
of 
individualism 
versus 
collectivism, 
the 
importance 
of 
freedom 
for 
the 
dignity 
and 
betterment 
of 
every 
human 
being, 
and 
the 
dangers 
from 
surrendering 
liberty 
and 
property 
to 
the 
paternalistic 
state. 
Through 
it 
all, 
the 
reader 
is 
offered 
a 
vision 
of 
the 
classical-liberal 
ideal 
of 
the 
free 
and 
prosperous 
society. 


As 
with 
an 
earlier 
series 
of 
lectures 
that 
Ludwig 
von 
Mises 
delivered 
in 
1951, 
and 
which 
was 
published 
by 
FEE 
under 
the 
title 
The 
Free 
Market 
and 



Its 
Enemies,19 
a 
unique 
quality 
of 
Marxism 
Unmasked 
is 
that 
it 
captures 
Mises 
as 
teacher. 
Unlike 
many 
of 
his 
longer, 
more 
formal 
writings, 
these 
lectures 
are 
peppered 
with 
numerous 
historical 
asides 
and 
common-sense 
examples 
that 
convey 
the 
ease 
and 
spirit 
of 
the 
spoken 
word. 


These 
lectures, 
like 
the 
earlier 
ones, 
were 
taken 
down, 
word 
for 
word, 
in 
shorthand 
and 
then 
transcribed 
by 
Bettina 
Bien 
Greaves, 
a 
long-time 
former 
senior 
staff 
member 
at 
the 
Foundation 
for 
Economic 
Education. 
Mrs. 
Greaves 
is 
one 
of 
the 
leading 
experts 
on 
the 
ideas 
and 
writings 
of 
Ludwig 
von 
Mises, 
and 
her 
deep 
appreciation 
for 
his 
contributions 
to 
economic 
theory 
and 
policy 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
care 
with 
which 
she 
transcribed 
these 
lectures 
for 
eventual 
publication. 
They 
would 
not 
be 
available 
now 
in 
print 
if 
not 
for 
her 
dedication 
and 
diligent 
scholarship, 
for 
which 
we 
are 
all 
especially 
grateful. 


When 
Mises 
delivered 
these 
lectures 
Marxian 
socialism 
seemed 
to 
be 
conquering 
the 
world. 
Despite 
the 
fall 
of 
the 
Berlin 
Wall 
in 
1989 
and 
the 
collapse 
of 
the 
Soviet 
Union 
in 
1991, 
Marxian 
criticisms 
of 
capitalist 
society 
still 
set 
the 
tone 
for 
those 
around 
the 
world 
who 
persistently 
hope 
for 
the 
end 
of 
human 
freedom 
and 
the 
market 
economy.20 
For 
that 
reason, 
what 
Mises 
had 
to 
say 
more 
than 
50 
years 
ago 
still 
has 
much 
meaning 
for 
us 
today. 


But 
now, 
simply 
enjoy 
“listening” 
to 
the 
mind 
of 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
economists 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century 
as 
you 
read 
this 
book.

Mind, 
Materialism, 
and 
the 
Fate 
of 
Man 


THE 
FIRST 
FIVE 
LECTURES 
IN 
THIS 
SERIES 
will 
be 
on 
philosophy, 
not 
on 
economics. 
Philosophy 
is 
important 
because 
everybody, 
whether 
or 
not 
he 
knows 
it, 
has 
a 
definite 
philosophy, 
and 
his 
philosophical 
ideas 
guide 
his 
actions. 


The 
philosophy 
of 
today 
is 
that 
of 
Karl 
Marx 
[1818–1883]. 
He 
is 
the 
most 
powerful 
personality 
of 
our 
age. 
Karl 
Marx 
and 
the 
ideas 
of 
Karl 
Marx 
—ideas 
which 
he 
did 
not 
invent, 
develop, 
or 
improve, 
but 
which 
he 
combined 
into 
a 
system—are 
widely 
accepted 
today, 
even 
by 
many 
who 
emphatically 
declare 
that 
they 
are 
anti-communist 
and 
anti-Marxist. 
To 
a 
considerable 
extent, 
without 
knowing 
it, 
many 
people 
are 
philosophical 
Marxists, 
although 
they 
use 
different 
names 
for 
their 
philosophical 
ideas. 


Marxists 
today 
speak 
of 
Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism. 
Volumes 
are 
written 
today 
in 
Russia 
about 
the 
contributions 
of 
[Vladimir 
Ilyich] 
Lenin 
[1870–1924] 
and 
[Josef] 
Stalin 
[1879–1953]. 
Yet 
the 
system 
remains 
what 
it 
was 
in 
the 
days 
of 
Karl 
Marx; 
Marxism 
is 
in 
effect 
petrified. 
Lenin 
contributed 
only 
very 
strong 
invectives 
against 
his 
adversaries; 
Stalin 
contributed 
nothing. 
Thus, 
it 
is 
questionable 
to 
call 
any 
of 
these 
contributions 
“new,” 
when 
we 
realize 
that 
the 
most 
important 
contribution 
of 
Marx 
to 
this 
philosophy 
was 
published 
in 
1859.1 


It 
takes 
a 
long 
time 
for 
ideas 
to 
conquer 
the 
world. 
When 
Marx 
died 
in 
1883, 
his 
name 
was 
by 
and 
large 
unknown. 
A 
few 
newspapers 
reported 
in 
a 
couple 
of 
lines 
that 
Karl 
Marx, 
the 
author 
of 
various 
books, 
had 
died. 
Eugen 
von 
Böhm-Bawerk 
[1851–1914] 
published 
a 
critique 
of 
Marx’s 
economic 
ideas2 
in 
1896, 
but 
it 
was 
only 
20 
years 
later 
that 
people 
began 
to 
consider 
Marx 
a 
philosopher. 


The 
ideas 
of 
Marx 
and 
of 
his 
philosophy 
truly 
dominate 
our 
age. 
The 
interpretation 
of 
current 
events 
and 
the 
interpretation 
of 
history 
in 
popular 
books, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
philosophical 
writings, 
novels, 
plays, 
and 
so 
forth, 
are 
by 
and 
large 
Marxist. 
At 
the 
center 
is 
the 
Marxian 
philosophy 
of 
history. 
From 



this 
philosophy 
is 
borrowed 
the 
term 
“dialectical,” 
which 
is 
applied 
to 
all 
his 
ideas. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
so 
important 
as 
it 
is 
to 
realize 
what 
Marxist 
materialism 
means. 


Materialism 
has 
two 
different 
meanings. 
The 
first 
refers 
exclusively 
to 
ethical 
problems. 
A 
material 
man 
is 
interested 
only 
in 
material 
things––food, 
drink, 
shelter––not 
in 
art, 
culture, 
and 
so 
forth. 
In 
this 
sense, 
the 
majority 
of 
men 
are 
materialists. 
The 
second 
meaning 
of 
materialism 
refers 
to 
a 
special 
group 
of 
solutions 
proposed 
to 
a 
basic 
philosophical 
problem––the 
relation 
between 
the 
human 
mind 
or 
soul 
on 
the 
one 
side, 
and 
the 
human 
body 
and 
the 
physiological 
functions 
of 
the 
body 
on 
the 
other 
side. 
Various 
answers 
to 
this 
problem 
have 
been 
offered––among 
them 
religious 
answers. 
We 
know 
very 
well 
that 
there 
is 
a 
connection 
between 
body 
and 
mind; 
surgery 
has 
proved 
that 
certain 
damages 
to 
the 
brain 
bring 
about 
certain 
changes 
in 
the 
function 
of 
the 
human 
mind. 
However, 
materialists 
of 
this 
second 
variety 
explain 
all 
manifestations 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
as 
products 
of 
the 
body. 


Among 
these 
philosophical 
materialists, 
there 
are 
two 
schools 
of 
thought: 


A. 
One 
school 
considers 
man 
as 
a 
machine. 
This 
machine 
variety 
of 
materialists 
say 
these 
problems 
are 
very 
simple––the 
human 
“machine” 
works 
precisely 
as 
any 
other 
machine 
works. 
A 
Frenchman, 
Julien 
de 
La 
Mettrie 
[1709–1751], 
wrote 
a 
book 
containing 
this 
idea, 
Man, 
the 
Machine; 
and 
today 
many 
people 
still 
want 
to 
explain 
all 
operations 
of 
the 
human 
mind, 
directly 
or 
indirectly, 
as 
if 
they 
were 
mechanical 
operations. 
For 
instance, 
see 
the 
Encyclopedia 
of 
the 
Social 
Sciences. 
One 
of 
the 
contributors, 
a 
teacher 
at 
the 
New 
School 
for 
Social 
Research, 
says 
the 
newborn 
child 
is 
like 
a 
Ford 
car, 
ready 
to 
run. 
Perhaps! 
But 
a 
machine, 
a 
newborn 
Ford, 
does 
not 
run 
by 
itself. 
A 
machine 
doesn’t 
achieve 
anything, 
doesn’t 
do 
anything 
alone––it 
is 
always 
men 
or 
a 
number 
of 
men 
who 
achieve 
something 
by 
means 
of 
the 
machine. 
Someone 
must 
run 
the 
machine. 
If 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
man 
ceases, 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
machine 
ceases 
too. 
We 
must 
ask 
this 
professor 
of 
the 
New 
School 
for 
Social 
Research, 
“Who 
runs 
the 
machine?” 
The 
answer 
would 
destroy 
the 
materialist 
machine 
doctrine. 
People 
also 
talk 
sometimes 
about 
“feeding” 
the 
machine, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
alive. 
But, 
of 
course, 
it 
isn’t 
alive. 
Then 
too 
people 
sometimes 
say 
the 
machine 
suffers 
a 
“nervous 
breakdown.” 
But 
how 
can 
an 
object 
without 
nerves 
suffer 
a 
nervous 
breakdown? 
This 
machine 
doctrine 
has 
been 
repeated 



again 
and 
again, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
very 
realistic. 
We 
don’t 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
it 
because 
no 
serious 
men 
really 
believe 
it. 


B. 
The 
physiological 
doctrine 
put 
forth 
by 
the 
second 
class 
of 
materialists 
is 
more 
important. 
This 
doctrine 
was 
formulated 
in 
a 
primitive 
way 
by 
Ludwig 
Feuerbach 
[1804–1872] 
and 
Karl 
Vogt 
[1817–1895] 
in 
the 
early 
days 
of 
Karl 
Marx. 
This 
idea 
was 
that 
thoughts 
and 
ideas 
are 
“simply” 
secretions 
of 
the 
brain. 
(No 
materialist 
philosopher 
ever 
fails 
to 
use 
the 
world 
“simply.” 
That 
means, 
“I 
know, 
but 
I 
can’t 
explain 
it.”) 
Today 
scientists 
know 
that 
certain 
pathological 
conditions 
cause 
certain 
secretions, 
and 
that 
certain 
secretions 
cause 
certain 
activities 
in 
the 
brain. 
But 
these 
secretions 
are 
chemically 
the 
same 
for 
all 
people 
in 
the 
same 
situation 
and 
condition. 
However, 
ideas 
and 
thoughts 
are 
not 
the 
same 
for 
all 
people 
in 
the 
same 
situation 
and 
condition; 
they 
are 
different. 
First, 
ideas 
and 
thoughts 
are 
not 
tangible. 
And 
second, 
the 
same 
external 
factors 
do 
not 
produce 
the 
same 
reaction 
with 
everybody. 
An 
apple 
once 
fell 
from 
a 
tree 
and 
hit 
a 
certain 
young 
man 
[Isaac 
Newton]. 
This 
may 
have 
happened 
to 
many 
other 
young 
men 
before, 
but 
this 
particular 
happening 
challenged 
this 
particular 
young 
man 
and 
he 
developed 
some 
ideas 
from 
it. 


But 
people 
do 
not 
always 
have 
the 
same 
thoughts 
when 
they 
are 
presented 
with 
the 
same 
facts. 
For 
instance, 
in 
school 
some 
learn; 
some 
don’t. 
There 
are 
differences 
in 
men. 


Bertrand 
Russell 
[1872–1970] 
asked, 
“What 
is 
the 
difference 
between 
men 
and 
stones?” 
He 
said 
there 
was 
no 
difference 
except 
that 
men 
react 
to 
more 
stimuli 
than 
do 
stones. 
But 
actually 
there 
is 
a 
difference. 
Stones 
react 
according 
to 
a 
definite 
pattern 
which 
we 
can 
know; 
we 
can 
anticipate 
what 
will 
happen 
to 
a 
stone 
if 
it 
is 
treated 
in 
a 
certain 
way. 
But 
men 
don’t 
all 
react 
the 
same 
way 
when 
treated 
a 
certain 
way; 
we 
cannot 
establish 
such 
categories 
of 
actions 
for 
men. 
Thus, 
even 
though 
many 
people 
think 
physiological 
materialism 
is 
a 
solution, 
it 
actually 
leads 
to 
a 
dead 
end. 
If 
it 
were 
really 
the 
solution 
to 
this 
problem, 
it 
would 
mean 
that 
in 
any 
event 
we 
could 
know 
the 
way 
everyone 
would 
react. 
We 
cannot 
even 
imagine 
what 
the 
consequences 
would 
be 
if 
everybody 
knew 
what 
everybody 
else 
was 
going 
to 
do. 


Karl 
Marx 
was 
not 
a 
materialist 
in 
the 
first 
sense––the 
machine 
sense. 
But 
the 
physiological 
idea 
was 
very 
popular 
in 
his 
day. 
It 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
know 
exactly 
what 
influenced 
Marx 
because 
he 
had 
personal 
hatreds 
and 
envies. 
Karl 
Marx 
hated 
Vogt, 
the 
exponent 
of 
physiological 
materialism. 
As 
soon 
as 
materialists 
like 
Vogt 
began 
to 
talk 
politics, 
Karl 
Marx 
said 
they 
had 
bad 



ideas; 
that 
meant 
Marx 
didn’t 
like 
them. 


Marx 
developed 
what 
he 
thought 
was 
a 
new 
system. 
According 
to 
his 
materialist 
interpretation 
of 
history, 
the 
“material 
productive 
forces” 
(this 
is 
an 
exact 
translation 
of 
the 
German) 
are 
the 
bases 
of 
everything. 
Each 
stage 
of 
the 
material 
productive 
forces 
corresponds 
to 
a 
definite 
stage 
of 
production 
relations. 
The 
material 
productive 
forces 
determine 
the 
production 
relations, 
that 
is, 
the 
type 
of 
ownership 
and 
property 
which 
exists 
in 
the 
world. 
And 
the 
production 
relations 
determine 
the 
superstructure. 
In 
the 
terminology 
of 
Marx, 
capitalism 
or 
feudalism 
are 
production 
relations. 
Each 
of 
these 
was 
necessarily 
produced 
by 
a 
particular 
stage 
of 
the 
material 
productive 
forces. 
In 
1859, 
Karl 
Marx 
said 
a 
new 
stage 
of 
material 
productive 
forces 
would 
produce 
socialism. 


But 
what 
are 
these 
material 
productive 
forces? 
Just 
as 
Marx 
never 
said 
what 
a 
“class” 
was, 
so 
he 
never 
said 
exactly 
what 
the 
“material 
productive 
forces” 
are. 
After 
looking 
through 
his 
writings 
we 
find 
that 
the 
material 
productive 
forces 
are 
the 
tools 
and 
machines. 
In 
one 
of 
his 
books 
[Misère 
de 
la 
philosophie—The 
Poverty 
of 
Philosophy], 
written 
in 
French 
in 
1847, 
Marx 
said 
“the 
hand 
mill 
produces 
feudalism––the 
steam 
mill 
produces 
capitalism.”3 
He 
didn’t 
say 
it 
in 
this 
book, 
but 
in 
other 
writings 
he 
wrote 
that 
other 
machines 
will 
come 
which 
will 
produce 
socialism. 


Marx 
tried 
hard 
to 
avoid 
the 
geographical 
interpretation 
of 
progress, 
because 
that 
had 
already 
been 
discredited. 
What 
he 
said 
was 
that 
“tools” 
were 
the 
basis 
of 
progress. 
Marx 
and 
[Friedrich] 
Engels 
[1820–1895] 
believed 
that 
new 
machines 
would 
be 
developed 
which 
would 
lead 
to 
socialism. 
They 
rejoiced 
at 
every 
new 
machine, 
thinking 
that 
meant 
socialism 
was 
just 
around 
the 
corner. 
In 
the 
French 
book 
of 
1847, 
he 
criticized 
those 
who 
attached 
importance 
to 
the 
division 
of 
labor; 
he 
said 
the 
important 
thing 
was 
the 
tools. 


We 
must 
not 
forget 
that 
tools 
don’t 
fall 
from 
heaven. 
They 
are 
the 
products 
of 
ideas. 
To 
explain 
ideas, 
Marx 
said 
the 
tools, 
the 
machines––the 
material 
productive 
forces––reflect 
themselves 
in 
the 
brains 
of 
men 
and 
in 
this 
way 
ideas 
come. 
But 
the 
tools 
and 
machines 
are 
themselves 
the 
product 
of 
ideas. 
Also, 
before 
there 
can 
be 
machines, 
there 
must 
be 
division 
of 
labor. 
And 
before 
there 
can 
be 
division 
of 
labor, 
definite 
ideas 
must 
be 
developed. 
The 
origin 
of 
these 
ideas 
cannot 
be 
explained 
by 
something 
which 
is 
possible 
only 
in 
a 
society, 
which 
is 
itself 
the 
product 
of 
ideas. 


The 
term 
“material” 
fascinated 
people. 
To 
explain 
changes 
in 
ideas, 
changes 
in 
thoughts, 
changes 
in 
all 
those 
things 
which 
are 
the 
products 
of 



ideas, 
Marx 
reduced 
them 
to 
changes 
in 
technological 
ideas. 
In 
this 
he 
was 
not 
original. 
For 
example, 
Hermann 
Ludwig 
Ferdinand 
von 
Helmholtz 
[1821–1894] 
and 
Leopold 
von 
Ranke 
[1795-1886] 
interpreted 
history 
as 
the 
history 
of 
technology. 


It 
is 
the 
task 
of 
history 
to 
explain 
why 
definite 
inventions 
were 
not 
put 
into 
practice 
by 
people 
who 
had 
all 
the 
physical 
knowledge 
required 
for 
their 
construction. 
Why, 
for 
instance, 
did 
the 
ancient 
Greeks, 
who 
had 
the 
technical 
knowledge, 
not 
develop 
railroads? 


As 
soon 
as 
a 
doctrine 
becomes 
popular, 
it 
is 
simplified 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
be 
understood 
by 
the 
masses. 
Marx 
said 
everything 
depends 
on 
economic 
conditions. 
As 
he 
stated 
in 
his 
1847 
French 
book 
[The 
Poverty 
of 
Philosophy], 
he 
meant 
that 
the 
history 
of 
factories 
and 
tools 
developed 
independently. 
According 
to 
Marx, 
the 
whole 
movement 
of 
human 
history 
appears 
as 
a 
corollary 
to 
the 
development 
of 
the 
material 
productive 
forces, 
the 
tools. 
With 
this 
development 
of 
tools, 
the 
construction 
of 
society 
changes 
and 
as 
a 
consequence 
everything 
else 
changes 
too. 
By 
everything 
else, 
he 
meant 
the 
superstructure. 
Marxian 
authors, 
writing 
after 
Marx, 
explained 
everything 
in 
the 
superstructure 
as 
due 
to 
definite 
changes 
in 
the 
production 
relations. 
And 
they 
explained 
everything 
in 
the 
production 
relations 
as 
due 
to 
changes 
in 
the 
tools 
and 
machines. 
This 
was 
a 
vulgarization, 
a 
simplification, 
of 
the 
Marxian 
doctrine 
for 
which 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
were 
not 
completely 
responsible. 
They 
created 
a 
lot 
of 
nonsense, 
but 
they 
are 
not 
responsible 
for 
all 
the 
nonsense 
today. 


What 
is 
the 
influence 
of 
this 
Marxian 
doctrine 
on 
ideas? 
The 
philosopher 
René 
Descartes 
[1596–1650], 
who 
lived 
in 
the 
early 
seventeenth 
century, 
believed 
that 
man 
had 
a 
mind 
and 
that 
man 
thinks, 
but 
that 
animals 
were 
merely 
machines. 
Marx 
said, 
of 
course, 
Descartes 
lived 
in 
an 
age 
in 
which 
the 
“Manufakturperioden,” 
the 
tools 
and 
machines, 
were 
such 
that 
he 
was 
forced 
to 
explain 
his 
theory 
by 
saying 
that 
animals 
were 
machines. 
Albrecht 
von 
Hailer 
[1708–1777], 
a 
Swiss, 
said 
the 
same 
thing 
in 
the 
eighteenth 
century 
(he 
didn’t 
like 
liberal 
government’s 
equality 
under 
law). 
Between 
these 
two 
men, 
lived 
de 
La 
Mettrie, 
who 
also 
explained 
man 
as 
a 
machine. 
Therefore, 
Marx’s 
concept 
that 
ideas 
were 
a 
product 
of 
the 
tools 
and 
machines 
of 
a 
particular 
era 
is 
easily 
disproved. 


John 
Locke 
[1632–1704], 
the 
well-known 
philosopher 
of 
empiricism, 
declared 
that 
everything 
in 
men’s 
minds 
comes 
from 
sensual 
experience. 
Marx 
says 
John 
Locke 
was 
a 
spokesman 
for 
the 
class 
doctrine 
of 
the 



bourgeoisie. 
This 
leads 
to 
two 
different 
deductions 
from 
the 
writings 
of 
Karl 
Marx: 
(1) 
The 
interpretation 
he 
gave 
to 
Descartes 
is 
that 
he 
was 
living 
in 
an 
age 
when 
machines 
were 
introduced 
and, 
therefore, 
Descartes 
explained 
the 
animal 
as 
a 
machine; 
and 
(2) 
The 
interpretation 
he 
gave 
to 
John 
Locke’s 
inspiration––that 
it 
came 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
was 
a 
representative 
of 
bourgeois 
class 
interests. 
Here 
are 
two 
incompatible 
explanations 
for 
the 
source 
of 
ideas. 
The 
first 
of 
these 
two 
explanations, 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
ideas 
are 
based 
on 
material 
productive 
forces, 
the 
tools 
and 
machines, 
is 
irreconcilable 
with 
the 
second, 
namely 
that 
class 
interests 
determine 
ideas. 


According 
to 
Marx, 
everybody 
is 
forced––by 
the 
material 
productive 
forces––to 
think 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
the 
result 
shows 
his 
class 
interests. 
You 
think 
in 
the 
way 
in 
which 
your 
“interests” 
force 
you 
to 
think; 
you 
think 
according 
to 
your 
class 
“interests.” 
Your 
“interests” 
are 
something 
independent 
of 
your 
mind 
and 
your 
ideas. 
Your 
“interests” 
exist 
in 
the 
world 
apart 
from 
your 
ideas. 
Consequently, 
the 
production 
of 
your 
ideas 
is 
not 
truth. 
Before 
the 
appearance 
of 
Karl 
Marx, 
the 
notion 
of 
truth 
had 
no 
meaning 
for 
the 
whole 
historical 
period. 
What 
the 
thinking 
of 
the 
people 
produced 
in 
the 
past 
was 
always 
“ideology,” 
not 
truth. 


“Les 
idéologues” 
in 
France 
were 
well 
advertised 
by 
Napoleon 
[1769– 
1821], 
who 
said 
everything 
would 
be 
all 
right 
in 
France 
but 
for 
these 
“idéologues.” 
In 
1812, 
Napoleon 
was 
defeated. 
He 
left 
the 
army 
in 
Russia, 
returned 
alone, 
incognito, 
and 
appeared 
at 
the 
end 
of 
December 
1812 
in 
Paris. 
He 
blamed 
the 
evils 
that 
happened 
to 
his 
country 
on 
the 
bad 
“idéologues” 
which 
influenced 
the 
country. 


Marx 
used 
ideology 
in 
a 
different 
sense. 
According 
to 
Marx, 
ideology 
was 
a 
doctrine 
thought 
out 
by 
members 
of 
a 
class. 
These 
doctrines 
were 
necessarily 
not 
truths, 
but 
merely 
the 
expressions 
of 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
class 
concerned. 
Of 
course, 
one 
day 
there 
will 
be 
a 
classless 
society. 
One 
class–– 
the 
proletarian 
class––prepares 
the 
way 
for 
the 
classless 
society. 
The 
truth 
of 
today 
is 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
proletarians. 
The 
proletarians 
will 
abolish 
all 
classes 
and 
then 
will 
come 
the 
Golden 
Age, 
the 
classless 
society. 


Marx 
called 
Joseph 
Dietzgen 
[1828–1888] 
a 
proletarian, 
but 
Marx 
would 
have 
called 
him 
a 
petty 
bourgeois 
if 
he 
had 
known 
more 
about 
him. 
Officially 
Marx 
approved 
all 
the 
ideas 
of 
Dietzgen, 
but 
in 
his 
private 
correspondence 
with 
Ferdinand 
Lassalle 
[1825–1864] 
he 
expressed 
some 
disagreement. 
There 
is 
no 
universal 
logic. 
Every 
class 
has 
its 
own 
logic. 
But, 
of 
course, 
the 
logic 
of 
the 
proletariat 
is 
already 
the 
true 
logic 
of 
the 
future. 



(These 
people 
were 
offended 
when 
the 
racists 
took 
over 
the 
same 
ideas, 
claiming 
that 
the 
various 
races 
have 
different 
logics 
but 
the 
logic 
of 
the 
Aryans 
is 
the 
true 
logic.) 


Karl 
Mannheim’s 
[1893–1947] 
sociology 
of 
knowledge 
grew 
out 
of 
Hitler’s 
ideas. 
Everybody 
thinks 
in 
ideologies––i.e., 
false 
doctrines. 
But 
there 
is 
one 
class 
of 
men 
which 
enjoys 
a 
special 
privilege––Marx 
called 
them 
the 
“unattached 
intellectuals.” 
These 
“unattached 
intellectuals” 
have 
the 
privilege 
of 
discovering 
truths 
which 
are 
not 
ideology. 


The 
influence 
of 
this 
idea 
of 
“interests” 
is 
enormous. 
First 
of 
all, 
remember 
that 
this 
doctrine 
doesn’t 
say 
men 
act 
and 
think 
according 
to 
what 
they 
consider 
to 
be 
their 
interests. 
Secondly, 
remember 
that 
they 
consider 
“interests” 
as 
independent 
of 
the 
thoughts 
and 
ideas 
of 
men. 
These 
independent 
interests 
force 
men 
to 
think 
and 
to 
act 
in 
a 
definite 
way. 
As 
an 
example 
of 
the 
influence 
this 
idea 
has 
on 
our 
thinking 
today, 
I 
might 
mention 
a 
U.S. 
Senator––not 
a 
Democrat––who 
said 
that 
people 
vote 
according 
to 
their 
“interests”; 
he 
didn’t 
say 
in 
accordance 
with 
what 
they 
think 
to 
be 
their 
interests. 
This 
is 
Marx’s 
idea––assuming 
that 
“interests” 
are 
something 
definite 
and 
apart 
from 
a 
person’s 
ideas. 
This 
idea 
of 
class 
doctrine 
was 
first 
developed 
by 
Karl 
Marx 
in 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto. 


Neither 
Engels 
nor 
Marx 
was 
of 
the 
proletariat. 
Engels 
was 
very 
wealthy. 
He 
hunted 
for 
fox 
in 
a 
red 
coat––this 
was 
the 
pastime 
of 
the 
rich. 
He 
had 
a 
girlfriend 
he 
considered 
too 
far 
beneath 
him 
to 
think 
of 
marrying. 
She 
died, 
and 
her 
sister 
became 
her 
successor. 
He 
finally 
married 
the 
sister, 
but 
just 
as 
she 
was 
dying––only 
two 
days 
before 
her 
death. 


Karl 
Marx 
never 
made 
much 
money 
himself. 
He 
received 
some 
money 
as 
a 
regular 
contributor 
to 
The 
New 
York 
Tribune. 
But 
he 
was 
almost 
completely 
supported 
by 
his 
friend 
Engels. 
Marx 
was 
not 
a 
proletarian; 
he 
was 
the 
son 
of 
a 
well-to-do 
lawyer. 
His 
wife, 
Mrs. 
Karl 
Marx 
[Jenny 
von 
Westphalen, 
1814–1881], 
was 
the 
daughter 
of 
a 
high 
Prussian 
Junker. 
And 
Marx’s 
brother-in-law 
was 
the 
head 
of 
the 
Prussian 
police. 


Thus, 
these 
two 
men, 
Marx 
and 
Engels, 
who 
claimed 
that 
the 
proletarian 
mind 
was 
different 
from 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
were 
in 
an 
awkward 
position. 
So 
they 
included 
a 
passage 
in 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto 
to 
explain: 
“When 
the 
time 
comes, 
some 
members 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie 
join 
the 
rising 
classes.” 
However, 
if 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
some 
men 
to 
free 
themselves 
from 
the 
law 
of 
class 
interests, 
then 
the 
law 
is 
no 
longer 
a 
general 
law. 


Marx’s 
idea 
was 
that 
the 
material 
productive 
forces 
lead 
men 
from 
one 



stage 
to 
another, 
until 
they 
reach 
socialism, 
which 
is 
the 
end 
and 
the 
height 
of 
it 
all. 
Marx 
said 
socialism 
cannot 
be 
planned 
in 
advance; 
history 
will 
take 
care 
of 
it. 
In 
Marx’s 
view, 
those 
who 
say 
how 
socialism 
will 
work 
are 
just 
“utopians.” 


Socialism 
was 
already 
defeated 
intellectually 
at 
the 
time 
Marx 
wrote. 
Marx 
answered 
his 
critics 
by 
saying 
that 
those 
who 
were 
in 
opposition 
were 
only 
“bourgeois.” 
He 
said 
there 
was 
no 
need 
to 
defeat 
his 
opponents’ 
arguments, 
but 
only 
to 
unmask 
their 
bourgeois 
background. 
And 
as 
their 
doctrine 
was 
only 
bourgeois 
ideology, 
it 
was 
not 
necessary 
to 
deal 
with 
it. 
This 
would 
mean 
that 
no 
bourgeois 
could 
write 
anything 
in 
favor 
of 
socialism. 
Thus, 
all 
such 
writers 
were 
anxious 
to 
prove 
they 
were 
proletarians. 
It 
might 
be 
appropriate 
to 
mention 
at 
this 
time 
also 
that 
the 
ancestor 
of 
French 
socialism, 
Saint-Simon,4 
was 
a 
descendant 
of 
a 
famous 
family 
of 
dukes 
and 
counts. 


It 
is 
simply 
not 
true 
that 
inventions 
develop 
because 
people 
search 
for 
practical 
purposes 
and 
not 
for 
truths. 


When 
Marx 
published 
his 
writings, 
German 
thought 
was 
dominated 
by 
George 
Wilhelm 
Friedrich 
Hegel 
[1770–1831], 
professor 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Berlin. 
Hegel 
had 
developed 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
philosophical 
evolution 
of 
history. 
In 
some 
respect 
his 
ideas 
were 
different 
from, 
even 
the 
very 
opposite 
to, 
those 
of 
Marx. 
Hegel 
was 
the 
man 
who 
destroyed 
German 
thinking 
and 
German 
philosophy 
for 
more 
than 
a 
century, 
at 
least. 
He 
found 
a 
warning 
in 
Immanuel 
Kant 
[1724–1804] 
who 
said 
the 
philosophy 
of 
history 
can 
only 
be 
written 
by 
a 
man 
who 
has 
the 
courage 
to 
pretend 
that 
he 
sees 
the 
world 
with 
the 
eyes 
of 
God. 
Hegel 
believed 
he 
had 
the 
“eyes 
of 
God,” 
that 
he 
knew 
the 
end 
of 
history, 
that 
he 
knew 
the 
plans 
of 
God. 
He 
said 
Geist 
(mind) 
develops 
itself 
and 
manifests 
itself 
in 
the 
course 
of 
historical 
evolution. 
Therefore, 
the 
course 
of 
history 
is 
inevitably 
progress 
from 
less 
satisfactory 
to 
more 
satisfactory 
conditions. 


In 
1825, 
Hegel 
said 
that 
we 
have 
reached 
a 
wonderful 
state 
of 
affairs. 
He 
considered 
the 
Prussian 
kingdom 
of 
Friedrich 
Wilhelm 
III 
[1770–1840] 
and 
the 
Prussian 
Union 
Church 
as 
the 
perfection 
of 
secular 
and 
spiritual 
government. 
Marx 
said, 
as 
Hegel 
had, 
that 
there 
was 
history 
in 
the 
past, 
but 
there 
will 
be 
no 
history 
anymore 
when 
we 
have 
reached 
a 
state 
that 
is 
satisfactory. 
Thus, 
Marx 
adopted 
the 
Hegelian 
system, 
although 
he 
used 
material 
productive 
forces 
instead 
of 
Geist. 
Material 
productive 
forces 
go 
through 
various 
stages. 
The 
present 
stage 
is 
very 
bad, 
but 
there 
is 
one 
thing 
in 



its 
favor––it 
is 
the 
necessary 
preliminary 
stage 
for 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
perfect 
state 
of 
socialism. 
And 
socialism 
is 
just 
around 
the 
corner. 


Hegel 
was 
called 
the 
philosopher 
of 
Prussian 
absolutism. 
He 
died 
in 
1831. 
His 
school 
thought 
in 
terms 
of 
left 
and 
right 
wings. 
(The 
left 
didn’t 
like 
the 
Prussian 
government 
and 
the 
Prussian 
Union 
Church.) 
This 
distinction 
between 
the 
left 
and 
the 
right 
has 
existed 
since 
then. 
In 
the 
French 
Parliament, 
those 
who 
didn’t 
like 
the 
king’s 
government 
were 
seated 
on 
the 
left 
side 
of 
the 
assembly 
hall. 
Today 
no 
one 
wants 
to 
sit 
on 
the 
right. 


Originally, 
i.e., 
before 
Karl 
Marx, 
the 
term 
“right” 
meant 
the 
supporters 
of 
representative 
government 
and 
civil 
liberties, 
as 
opposed 
to 
the 
“left” 
who 
favored 
royal 
absolutism 
and 
the 
absence 
of 
civil 
rights. 
The 
appearance 
of 
socialist 
ideas 
changed 
the 
meaning 
of 
these 
terms. 
Some 
of 
the 
“left” 
have 
been 
outspoken 
in 
expressing 
their 
views. 
For 
instance, 
Plato 
[427–347 
BC] 
was 
frank 
in 
stating 
that 
a 
philosopher 
shall 
rule. 
And 
Auguste 
Comte 
[1798– 
1857] 
said 
that 
freedom 
was 
necessary 
in 
the 
past 
because 
it 
made 
it 
possible 
for 
him 
to 
publish 
his 
books, 
but 
now 
that 
these 
books 
have 
been 
published 
there 
is 
no 
longer 
any 
need 
for 
freedom. 
And 
in 
the 
same 
way 
Etienne 
Cabet 
[1788–1856] 
spoke 
of 
three 
classes 
of 
books––the 
bad 
books, 
which 
should 
be 
burned; 
the 
intermediate 
books, 
which 
should 
be 
amended; 
and 
the 
remaining 
“good” 
books. 
Therefore, 
there 
was 
great 
confusion 
as 
to 
the 
civil 
liberties 
to 
be 
assigned 
to 
the 
citizens 
of 
the 
socialist 
state. 
This 
was 
because 
Marxian 
ideas 
did 
not 
develop 
in 
countries 
which 
had 
civil 
liberties, 
but 
in 
countries 
in 
which 
the 
people 
did 
not 
have 
civil 
liberties. 


Nikolai 
Bukharin 
[1888–1938], 
a 
Communist 
author 
who 
lived 
in 
a 
Communist 
country, 
wrote 
a 
pamphlet 
in 
19175, 
in 
which 
he 
said, 
we 
asked 
for 
freedom 
of 
the 
press, 
thought, 
and 
civil 
liberties 
in 
the 
past 
because 
we 
were 
in 
the 
opposition 
and 
needed 
these 
liberties 
to 
conquer. 
Now 
that 
we 
have 
conquered, 
there 
is 
no 
longer 
any 
need 
for 
such 
civil 
liberties. 
[Bukharin 
was 
tried 
and 
condemned 
to 
death 
in 
the 
Moscow 
Purge 
Trial 
of 
March 
1938.] 
If 
Mr. 
Bukharin 
had 
been 
an 
American 
Communist, 
he 
would 
probably 
still 
be 
alive 
and 
free 
to 
write 
more 
pamphlets 
about 
why 
freedom 
is 
not 
necessary. 


These 
peculiarities 
of 
Marxian 
philosophy 
can 
only 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
Marx, 
although 
living 
in 
Great 
Britain, 
was 
not 
dealing 
with 
conditions 
in 
Great 
Britain, 
where 
he 
felt 
civil 
liberties 
were 
no 
longer 
needed, 
but 
with 
the 
conditions 
in 
Germany, 
France, 
Italy, 
and 
so 
on, 
where 
civil 
liberties 
were 
still 
needed. 
Thus 
we 
see 
that 
the 
distinction 
between 
right 



and 
left, 
which 
had 
meaning 
in 
the 
days 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution, 
no 
longer 
has 
any 
meaning.

Class 
Conflict 
and 
Revolutionary 
Socialism 


MARX 
ASSUMED 
that 
“interests” 
were 
independent 
of 
human 
ideas 
and 
thoughts. 
He 
said 
that 
socialism 
was 
the 
ideal 
system 
for 
the 
proletariat. 
He 
said 
class 
interests 
determine 
the 
thinking 
of 
individuals 
and 
that 
this 
situation 
causes 
irreconcilable 
conflicts 
between 
the 
various 
classes. 
Marx 
then 
returned 
to 
the 
point 
at 
which 
he 
had 
started—namely, 
that 
socialism 
is 
the 
ideal 
state. 


The 
fundamental 
concept 
of 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto 
(1848) 
was 
that 
of 
“class” 
and 
“class 
conflict.” 
But 
Marx 
didn’t 
say 
what 
a 
“class” 
was. 
Marx 
died 
in 
1883, 
35 
years 
after 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto. 
In 
those 
35 
years 
he 
published 
many 
volumes, 
but 
in 
not 
one 
of 
them 
did 
he 
say 
what 
he 
meant 
by 
the 
term 
“class.” 
After 
Marx’s 
death, 
Friedrich 
Engels 
published 
the 
unfinished 
manuscript 
of 
the 
third 
volume 
of 
Marx’s 
Das 
Kapital. 
Engels 
said 
this 
manuscript, 
on 
which 
Marx 
had 
stopped 
work, 
many 
years 
before 
he 
died, 
had 
been 
found 
in 
Marx’s 
desk 
after 
his 
death. 
In 
one 
three-page 
chapter 
in 
that 
volume, 
Marx 
tells 
us 
what 
a 
“class” 
was 
not. 
But 
you 
may 
search 
through 
all 
his 
writings 
to 
learn 
what 
a 
“class” 
was 
without 
ever 
finding 
out. 
In 
fact, 
“classes” 
don’t 
exist 
in 
nature. 
It 
is 
our 
thinking— 
our 
arranging 
in 
categories—that 
constructs 
classes 
in 
our 
minds. 
The 
question 
is 
not 
whether 
social 
classes 
exist 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
Karl 
Marx; 
the 
question 
is 
whether 
we 
can 
use 
the 
concept 
of 
social 
classes 
in 
the 
way 
in 
which 
Karl 
Marx 
meant 
it. 
We 
can’t. 


Marx 
did 
not 
see 
that 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
“interest” 
of 
an 
individual, 
or 
of 
a 
class, 
cannot 
be 
solved 
simply 
by 
referring 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
is 
such 
an 
interest 
and 
that 
men 
must 
act 
according 
to 
their 
interests. 
Two 
questions 
must 
be 
asked: 
(1) 
Toward 
what 
ultimate 
ends 
do 
these 
“interests” 
lead 
people? 
(2) 
What 
methods 
do 
they 
want 
to 
apply 
in 
order 
to 
reach 
these 
ends? 


The 
First 
International 
was 
a 
small 
group 
of 
people, 
a 
committee 
of 
a 
few 
men 
in 
London, 
friends 
and 
enemies 
of 
Karl 
Marx. 
Someone 
suggested 
that 
they 
cooperate 
with 
the 
British 
labor-union 
movement. 
In 
1865, 
Karl 



Marx 
read 
at 
the 
meeting 
of 
the 
International 
Committee, 
a 
paper, 
Value, 
Price, 
and 
Profit, 
one 
of 
his 
few 
writings 
originally 
written 
in 
English. 
In 
this 
paper, 
he 
pointed 
out 
that 
the 
methods 
of 
the 
union 
movement 
were 
very 
bad 
and 
must 
be 
changed. 
Paraphrasing:“The 
unions 
want 
to 
improve 
the 
fate 
of 
the 
workers 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
capitalist 
system—this 
is 
hopeless 
and 
useless. 
Within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
capitalist 
system 
there 
is 
no 
possibility 
of 
improving 
the 
state 
of 
the 
workers. 
The 
best 
the 
union 
could 
achieve 
in 
this 
way 
would 
be 
some 
short-term 
success. 
The 
unions 
must 
abandon 
this 
‘conservative’ 
policy; 
they 
must 
adopt 
the 
revolutionary 
policy. 
They 
must 
fight 
for 
the 
abolition 
of 
the 
wage 
society 
as 
such 
and 
work 
for 
the 
coming 
of 
socialism.” 
Marx 
didn’t 
have 
the 
courage 
to 
publish 
this 
paper 
during 
his 
lifetime; 
it 
was 
published 
only 
after 
his 
death 
by 
one 
of 
his 
daughters. 
He 
didn’t 
want 
to 
antagonize 
the 
labor 
unions; 
he 
still 
had 
hopes 
they 
would 
abandon 
their 
theory. 


Here 
is 
an 
obvious 
conflict 
of 
opinions 
among 
the 
proletarians 
themselves 
concerning 
the 
right 
means 
to 
use. 
The 
proletarian 
unions 
and 
Marx 
disagreed 
as 
to 
what 
was 
in 
the 
“interest” 
of 
the 
proletarians. 
Marx 
said 
that 
the 
“interest” 
of 
a 
class 
was 
obvious—there 
could 
be 
no 
doubt 
about 
it— 
everyone 
would 
know 
it. 
Then 
here 
comes 
a 
man 
who 
doesn’t 
belong 
to 
this 
proletarian 
class 
at 
all, 
a 
writer 
and 
a 
lawyer 
who 
tells 
the 
unions 
they 
were 
wrong. 
“This 
is 
bad 
policy,” 
he 
said. 
“You 
must 
radically 
change 
your 
policy.” 
Here 
the 
whole 
idea 
of 
the 
class 
breaks 
down, 
the 
idea 
that 
an 
individual 
may 
sometimes 
err 
but 
that 
a 
class 
as 
a 
whole 
can 
never 
err. 


Criticisms 
of 
Marxian 
doctrines 
have 
always 
been 
superficial. 
They 
haven’t 
pointed 
out 
how 
Marx 
contradicted 
himself 
and 
how 
he 
failed 
to 
explain 
his 
ideas. 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
critique1 
was 
good 
but 
he 
didn’t 
cover 
the 
entire 
system. 
Critics 
of 
Marx 
didn’t 
even 
discover 
Karl 
Marx’s 
most 
manifest 
contradictions. 


Marx 
believed 
in 
the 
“iron 
law 
of 
wages.” 
He 
accepted 
that 
as 
the 
fundamental 
basis 
of 
his 
economic 
doctrine. 
He 
didn’t 
like 
the 
German 
term 
for 
this 
law, 
the 
“brazen” 
law 
of 
wages, 
about 
which 
Ferdinand 
Lassalle 
[1825–1864] 
had 
published 
a 
pamphlet. 
Karl 
Marx 
and 
Ferdinand 
Lassalle 
were 
not 
friends; 
they 
were 
competitors, 
very 
serious 
competitors. 
Marx 
said 
Lassalle’s 
only 
contribution 
was 
the 
term 
itself, 
the 
“brazen” 
law 
of 
wages. 
And 
what 
was 
more, 
the 
term, 
was 
borrowed, 
borrowed 
from 
the 
dictionary 
and 
from 
Goethe.2 


The 
“iron 
law 
of 
wages” 
still 
survives 
in 
many 
textbooks, 
in 
the 
minds 



of 
politicians, 
and 
consequently 
in 
many 
of 
our 
laws. 
According 
to 
the 
“iron 
law 
of 
wages,” 
the 
wage 
rate 
is 
determined 
by 
the 
amount 
of 
food 
and 
other 
necessities 
required 
for 
the 
preservation 
and 
reproduction 
of 
life, 
to 
support 
the 
workers’ 
children 
until 
they 
can 
themselves 
work 
in 
the 
factories. 
If 
wage 
rates 
rise 
above 
this, 
the 
number 
of 
workers 
would 
increase 
and 
the 
increased 
number 
of 
workers 
would 
bring 
wage 
rates 
down 
again. 
Wages 
cannot 
drop 
below 
this 
point 
because 
there 
would 
then 
develop 
a 
shortage 
of 
labor. 
This 
law 
considers 
the 
worker 
to 
be 
some 
kind 
of 
microbe 
or 
rodent 
without 
free 
choice 
or 
free 
will. 


If 
you 
think 
it 
is 
absolutely 
impossible 
under 
the 
capitalist 
system 
for 
wages 
to 
deviate 
from 
this 
rate, 
how 
then 
can 
you 
still 
talk, 
as 
Marx 
did, 
about 
the 
progressive 
impoverishment 
of 
the 
workers 
as 
being 
inevitable? 
There 
is 
an 
insoluble 
contradiction 
between 
the 
Marxian 
idea 
of 
the 
iron 
law 
of 
wage 
rates, 
according 
to 
which 
wages 
will 
remain 
at 
a 
point 
at 
which 
they 
are 
sufficient 
to 
support 
the 
progeny 
of 
workers 
until 
they 
can 
themselves 
become 
workers, 
and 
his 
philosophy 
of 
history, 
which 
maintains 
that 
the 
workers 
will 
be 
more 
and 
more 
impoverished 
until 
they 
are 
driven 
to 
open 
rebellion, 
thus 
bringing 
about 
socialism. 
Of 
course, 
both 
doctrines 
are 
untenable. 
Even 
50 
years 
ago 
the 
leading 
socialist 
writers 
were 
forced 
to 
resort 
to 
other 
elaborate 
schemes 
in 
the 
attempt 
to 
support 
their 
theories. 
What 
is 
amazing 
is 
that, 
during 
the 
century 
since 
Marx’s 
writings, 
no 
one 
has 
pointed 
out 
this 
contradiction. 
And 
this 
contradiction 
is 
not 
the 
only 
contradiction 
in 
Marx. 


What 
really 
destroyed 
Marx 
was 
his 
idea 
of 
the 
progressive 
impoverishment 
of 
the 
workers. 
Marx 
didn’t 
see 
that 
the 
most 
important 
characteristic 
of 
capitalism 
was 
large-scale 
production 
for 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
masses; 
the 
main 
objective 
of 
capitalists 
is 
to 
produce 
for 
the 
broad 
masses. 
Nor 
did 
Marx 
see 
that 
under 
capitalism 
the 
customer 
is 
always 
right. 
In 
his 
capacity 
as 
a 
wage 
earner, 
the 
worker 
cannot 
determine 
what 
is 
to 
be 
made. 
But 
in 
his 
capacity 
as 
a 
customer, 
he 
is 
really 
the 
boss 
and 
tells 
his 
boss, 
the 
entrepreneur, 
what 
to 
do. 
His 
boss 
must 
obey 
the 
orders 
of 
the 
workers 
as 
they 
are 
members 
of 
the 
buying 
public. 
Mrs. 
Webb3, 
like 
other 
socialists, 
was 
the 
daughter 
of 
a 
well-to-do 
businessman. 
Like 
other 
socialists, 
she 
thought 
her 
father 
was 
an 
autocrat 
who 
gave 
orders 
to 
everybody. 
She 
didn’t 
see 
that 
he 
was 
subject 
to 
the 
sovereignty 
of 
the 
orders 
of 
the 
customers 
on 
the 
market. 
The 
“great” 
Mrs. 
Webb 
was 
no 
smarter 
than 
the 
dumbest 
messenger 
boy 
who 
sees 
only 
that 
his 
boss 
gives 
orders. 



Marx 
had 
no 
doubt 
as 
to 
what 
the 
ends 
were 
toward 
which 
men 
aim. 
Nor 
did 
he 
have 
any 
doubts 
as 
to 
the 
best 
way 
to 
attain 
these 
ends. 
How 
is 
it 
that 
a 
man 
who 
read 
so 
much 
and 
interrupted 
his 
reading 
only 
to 
write, 
didn’t 
realize 
the 
discrepancy 
in 
his 
ideas? 


To 
answer 
that 
question, 
we 
must 
go 
back 
to 
the 
thinking 
of 
his 
time. 
That 
was 
the 
time 
of 
Charles 
Darwin’s 
Origin 
of 
the 
Species 
[1859]. 
It 
was 
the 
intellectual 
fashion 
of 
that 
day 
to 
look 
upon 
men 
merely 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
their 
membership 
in 
the 
zoological 
class 
of 
mammals, 
which 
acted 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
instincts. 
Marx 
didn’t 
take 
into 
account 
the 
evolution 
of 
mankind 
above 
the 
level 
of 
very 
primitive 
men. 
He 
considered 
unskilled 
labor 
to 
be 
the 
normal 
type 
of 
labor 
and 
skilled 
labor 
as 
the 
exception. 
He 
wrote 
in 
one 
of 
his 
books 
that 
progress 
in 
the 
technological 
improvement 
of 
machines 
causes 
the 
disappearance 
of 
specialists 
because 
the 
machine 
can 
be 
operated 
by 
anyone; 
it 
takes 
no 
special 
skill 
to 
operate 
a 
machine. 
Therefore, 
the 
normal 
type 
of 
man 
in 
the 
future 
will 
be 
the 
non-specialist. 


With 
regard 
to 
many 
of 
his 
ideas, 
Marx 
belonged 
to 
much 
earlier 
ages, 
especially 
in 
constructing 
his 
philosophy 
of 
history. 
Marx 
substituted 
for 
Hegel’s 
evolution 
of 
Geist 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
material 
factors 
of 
production. 
He 
didn’t 
realize 
that 
the 
material 
factors 
of 
production, 
i.e., 
the 
tools 
and 
machines, 
are 
actually 
products 
of 
the 
human 
mind. 
He 
said 
these 
tools 
and 
machines, 
the 
material 
productive 
forces, 
inevitably 
bring 
about 
the 
coming 
of 
socialism. 
His 
theory 
has 
been 
called 
“dialectical 
materialism,” 
abbreviated 
by 
the 
socialists 
to 
“diamet.” 


[In 
an 
aside, 
Dr. 
Mises 
told 
of 
visiting 
a 
school 
in 
Mexico, 
an 
“escuela 
socialista,” 
a 
“socialist 
school.” 
Mises 
asked 
the 
school’s 
Mexican 
dean 
what 
“socialist 
school” 
meant. 
The 
dean 
explained 
that 
Mexican 
law 
required 
schools 
to 
teach 
the 
Darwinian 
doctrine 
of 
evolution 
and 
dialectical 
materialism. 
Then 
he 
commented 
on 
the 
provision 
in 
the 
law 
making 
this 
requirement 
and 
on 
the 
school 
system 
itself: 
“There 
is 
a 
great 
difference 
between 
the 
letter 
of 
the 
law 
and 
the 
practice. 
Ninety 
percent 
of 
the 
teachers 
in 
our 
schools 
are 
female 
and 
most 
of 
them 
are 
practicing 
Catholics.”] 


Marx 
reasoned 
from 
the 
thesis 
to 
the 
negation 
of 
the 
thesis 
to 
the 
negation 
of 
the 
negation. 
Private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
by 
every 
individual 
worker 
was 
the 
beginning, 
the 
thesis. 
This 
was 
the 
state 
of 
affairs 
in 
a 
society 
in 
which 
every 
worker 
was 
either 
an 
independent 
farmer 
or 
an 
artisan 
who 
owned 
the 
tools 
with 
which 
he 
was 
working. 
Negation 
of 
the 
thesis—ownership 
under 
capitalism—when 
the 
tools 
were 
no 
longer 



owned 
by 
the 
workers, 
but 
by 
the 
capitalists. 
Negation 
of 
the 
negation 
was 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
by 
the 
whole 
society. 
Reasoning 
in 
this 
way, 
Marx 
said 
he 
had 
discovered 
the 
law 
of 
historical 
evolution. 
And 
that 
is 
why 
he 
called 
it 
“scientific 
socialism.” 


Marx 
branded 
all 
previous 
socialists 
“utopian 
socialists” 
because 
they 
tried 
to 
point 
out 
why 
socialism 
was 
better. 
They 
wanted 
to 
convince 
their 
fellow 
citizens 
to 
their 
view 
because 
they 
expected 
people 
would 
adopt 
the 
socialist 
social 
system 
if 
they 
were 
convinced 
it 
was 
better. 
They 
were 
“utopians,” 
Marx 
said, 
because 
they 
tried 
to 
describe 
the 
future 
earthly 
paradise. 
Among 
the 
forerunners 
of 
Marx 
whom 
he 
considered 
“utopians” 
were 
Saint-Simon, 
a 
French 
aristocrat; 
Robert 
Owen 
[1757–1858], 
a 
British 
manufacturer; 
and 
Charles 
Fourier 
[1772–1837], 
a 
Frenchman 
who 
was 
without 
doubt 
a 
lunatic. 
(Fourier 
was 
called 
the 
“fou 
[fool] 
du 
Palais-Royal.” 
He 
used 
to 
make 
such 
statements 
as 
“In 
the 
age 
of 
socialism, 
the 
ocean 
will 
no 
longer 
be 
salt 
but 
lemonade.”) 
Marx 
considered 
these 
three 
as 
great 
forerunners. 
But, 
he 
said, 
they 
didn’t 
realize 
that 
what 
they 
were 
saying 
was 
just 
“utopian.” 
They 
expected 
the 
coming 
of 
socialism 
because 
of 
a 
change 
in 
the 
opinions 
of 
the 
people. 
But 
for 
Marx, 
the 
coming 
of 
socialism 
was 
inevitable; 
it 
would 
come 
with 
the 
inevitability 
of 
nature. 


On 
the 
one 
hand, 
Karl 
Marx 
wrote 
of 
the 
inevitability 
of 
socialism. 
But 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
he 
organized 
a 
socialist 
movement, 
a 
socialist 
party, 
declared 
again 
and 
again 
that 
his 
socialism 
was 
revolutionary, 
and 
that 
the 
violent 
overthrow 
of 
the 
government 
was 
necessary 
to 
bring 
about 
socialism. 


Marx 
borrowed 
his 
metaphors 
from 
the 
field 
of 
gynecology. 
The 
socialist 
party 
is 
like 
obstetrics, 
Marx 
said; 
it 
makes 
the 
coming 
of 
socialism 
possible. 
When 
asked 
if 
you 
consider 
the 
whole 
process 
inevitable, 
why 
do 
you 
not 
favor 
evolution 
instead 
of 
revolution, 
the 
Marxists 
reply, 
“There 
are 
no 
evolutions 
in 
life. 
Is 
not 
birth 
itself 
a 
revolution?” 


According 
to 
Marx, 
the 
goal 
of 
the 
socialist 
party 
was 
not 
to 
influence, 
but 
only 
to 
help 
the 
inevitable. 
But 
obstetrics 
itself 
influences 
and 
changes 
conditions. 
Obstetrics 
has 
actually 
brought 
about 
progress 
in 
this 
branch 
of 
medicine, 
and 
even 
saved 
lives. 
And 
by 
saving 
lives 
it 
could 
be 
said 
obstetrics 
has 
actually 
changed 
the 
course 
of 
history. 


The 
term 
“scientific” 
acquired 
prestige 
during 
the 
course 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century. 
Engels’ 
Anti-Dühring 
(1878) 
became 
one 
of 
the 
most 
successful 
books 
among 
the 
writings 
of 
philosophical 
Marxists. 
One 
chapter 
in 
this 
book 
was 
reprinted 
as 
a 
pamphlet 
under 
the 
title 
“The 
Development 
of 



Socialism 
from 
Utopia 
to 
Science,” 
and 
it 
had 
enormous 
success. 
Karl 
Radek 
[1885–1939], 
a 
Soviet 
Communist, 
later 
wrote 
a 
pamphlet 
called 
“The 
Development 
of 
Socialism, 
from 
Science 
to 
Action.” 


Marx’s 
doctrine 
of 
ideology 
was 
concocted 
to 
discredit 
the 
writings 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
[Tomás] 
Masaryk 
[1850–1937] 
of 
Czechoslovakia 
was 
born 
of 
poor 
people, 
farmers 
and 
workers, 
and 
he 
wrote 
about 
Marxism. 
Yet 
the 
Marxians 
called 
him 
a 
bourgeois. 
How 
could 
he 
be 
considered 
“bourgeois” 
if 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
called 
themselves 
“proletarian”? 


If 
the 
proletarians 
must 
think 
according 
to 
the 
“interests” 
of 
their 
class, 
what 
does 
it 
mean 
if 
there 
are 
disagreements 
and 
dissent 
among 
them? 
The 
confusion 
makes 
the 
situation 
very 
difficult 
to 
explain. 
When 
there 
is 
dissent 
among 
proletarians, 
they 
call 
a 
dissenter 
a 
“social 
traitor.” 
After 
Marx 
and 
Engels, 
the 
great 
man 
of 
the 
Communists 
was 
a 
German, 
Karl 
Kautsky 
[1854-1938]. 
In 
1917, 
when 
Lenin 
tried 
to 
revolutionize 
the 
whole 
world, 
Karl 
Kautsky 
was 
opposed 
to 
the 
idea. 
And 
because 
of 
this 
disagreement, 
the 
former 
great 
man 
of 
the 
party 
became 
overnight 
a 
“social 
traitor,” 
and 
he 
was 
called 
that 
as 
well 
as 
many 
other 
names. 


This 
idea 
is 
like 
that 
of 
the 
racists. 
The 
German 
racists 
declared 
that 
a 
definite 
set 
of 
political 
ideas 
were 
German 
and 
every 
real 
German 
must 
necessarily 
think 
according 
to 
this 
particular 
set 
of 
ideas. 
This 
was 
the 
Nazi 
idea. 
According 
to 
the 
Nazis, 
the 
best 
situation 
was 
to 
be 
in 
a 
state 
of 
war. 
But 
some 
Germans—Kant, 
Goethe, 
and 
Beethoven, 
for 
instance—had 
different 
“un-German” 
ideas. 
If 
not 
every 
German 
must 
think 
in 
a 
certain 
way, 
who 
is 
to 
decide 
which 
ideas 
are 
German 
and 
which 
are 
un-German? 
The 
answer 
can 
only 
be 
that 
an 
“inner 
voice” 
is 
the 
ultimate 
standard, 
the 
ultimate 
yardstick. 
This 
position 
necessarily 
leads 
to 
conflicts 
that 
must 
result 
in 
civil, 
or 
even 
international, 
war. 


There 
were 
two 
groups 
of 
Russians, 
both 
of 
whom 
considered 
themselves 
proletarians—the 
Bolsheviks 
and 
the 
Mensheviks. 
The 
only 
method 
to 
“settle” 
disagreements 
between 
them 
was 
to 
use 
force 
and 
liquidation. 
The 
Bolsheviks 
won. 
Then 
within 
the 
ranks 
of 
the 
Communist 
Bolsheviks 
there 
arose 
other 
differences 
of 
opinion—between 
Trotsky4 
and 
Stalin—and 
the 
only 
way 
to 
resolve 
their 
conflicts 
was 
a 
purge. 
Trotsky 
was 
forced 
into 
exile, 
trailed 
to 
Mexico, 
and 
there 
in 
1940 
he 
was 
hacked 
to 
death. 
Stalin 
originated 
nothing; 
he 
went 
back 
to 
the 
revolutionary 
Marx 
of 
1859— 
not 
to 
the 
interventionist 
Marx 
of 
1848. 


Unfortunately, 
purges 
are 
not 
something 
which 
happen 
just 
because 
men 



are 
imperfect. 
Purges 
are 
the 
necessary 
consequences 
of 
the 
philosophical 
foundation 
of 
Marxian 
socialism. 
If 
you 
cannot 
discuss 
philosophical 
differences 
of 
opinion 
in 
the 
same 
way 
you 
discuss 
other 
problems, 
you 
must 
find 
another 
solution—through 
violence 
and 
power. 
This 
refers 
not 
only 
to 
dissent 
concerning 
policies, 
economic 
problems, 
sociology, 
law, 
and 
so 
on. 
It 
refers 
also 
to 
problems 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
The 
Webbs, 
Lord 
and 
Lady 
Passfield, 
were 
shocked 
to 
learn 
that 
Russian 
magazines 
and 
papers 
dealt 
even 
with 
problems 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
philosophy 
of 
Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism. 
For 
instance, 
if 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
of 
opinion 
with 
regard 
to 
science 
or 
genetics, 
it 
must 
be 
decided 
by 
the 
“leader.” 
This 
is 
the 
necessary 
unavoidable 
consequence 
of 
the 
fact 
that, 
according 
to 
Marxist 
doctrine, 
you 
do 
not 
consider 
the 
possibility 
of 
dissent 
among 
honest 
people; 
either 
you 
think 
as 
I 
do, 
or 
you 
are 
a 
traitor 
and 
must 
be 
liquidated. 


The 
Communist 
Manifesto 
appeared 
in 
1848. 
In 
that 
document, 
Marx 
preached 
revolution; 
he 
believed 
the 
revolution 
was 
just 
around 
the 
corner. 
He 
believed 
then 
that 
socialism 
was 
to 
be 
brought 
about 
by 
a 
series 
of 
interventionist 
measures. 
He 
listed 
ten 
interventionist 
measures—among 
them 
the 
progressive 
income 
tax, 
the 
abolition 
of 
the 
rights 
of 
inheritance, 
agricultural 
reform, 
and 
so 
on. 
These 
measures 
were 
untenable, 
he 
said, 
but 
necessary 
for 
socialism 
to 
come. 


Thus, 
Karl 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
believed 
in 
1848, 
that 
socialism 
could 
be 
attained 
by 
interventionism. 
By 
1859, 
eleven 
years 
after 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto, 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
had 
abandoned 
the 
advocacy 
of 
interventions; 
they 
no 
longer 
expected 
socialism 
to 
come 
from 
legislative 
changes. 
They 
wanted 
to 
bring 
about 
socialism 
by 
a 
radical 
change 
overnight. 
From 
this 
point 
of 
view, 
followers 
of 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
considered 
later 
measures— 
the 
New 
Deal, 
the 
Fair 
Deal, 
and 
so 
forth—to 
be 
“petty 
bourgeois” 
policies. 
In 
the 
1840s 
Engels 
had 
said 
British 
labor 
laws 
were 
a 
sign 
of 
progress 
and 
a 
sign 
of 
the 
breakdown 
of 
capitalism. 
Later 
they 
called 
such 
interventionist 
measures 
or 
interventionist 
policy 
(Sozialpolitik) 
very 
bad. 


In 
1888–40 
years 
after 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto—a 
translation 
was 
made 
by 
an 
English 
writer. 
Engels 
added 
some 
comments 
to 
this 
translation. 
Referring 
to 
the 
ten 
interventionist 
measures 
advocated 
in 
the 
Manifesto, 
he 
said 
these 
measures 
were 
not 
only 
untenable, 
as 
the 
Manifesto 
claimed, 
but 
precisely 
because 
they 
were 
untenable, 
they 
would 
necessarily 
push 
further 
and 
further 
toward 
still 
more 
measures 
of 
this 
kind, 
until 



eventually 
these 
more 
advanced 
measures 
would 
lead 
to 
socialism.

Individualism 
and 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution 


LIBERALS 
STRESSED 
THE 
IMPORTANCE 
OF 
THE 
INDIVIDUAL. 
The 
nineteenth-
century 
liberals 
already 
considered 
the 
development 
of 
the 
individual 
the 
most 
important 
thing. 
“Individual 
and 
individualism” 
was 
the 
progressive 
and 
liberal 
slogan. 
Reactionaries 
had 
already 
attacked 
this 
position 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century. 


The 
rationalists 
and 
liberals 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
century 
pointed 
out 
that 
what 
was 
needed 
was 
good 
laws. 
Ancient 
customs 
that 
could 
not 
be 
justified 
by 
rationality 
should 
be 
abandoned. 
The 
only 
justification 
for 
a 
law 
was 
whether 
or 
not 
it 
was 
liable 
to 
promote 
the 
public 
social 
welfare. 
In 
many 
countries 
the 
liberals 
and 
rationalists 
asked 
for 
written 
constitutions, 
the 
codification 
of 
laws, 
and 
for 
new 
laws 
which 
would 
permit 
the 
development 
of 
the 
faculties 
of 
every 
individual. 


Areaction 
to 
this 
idea 
developed, 
especially 
in 
Germany 
where 
the 
jurist 
and 
legal 
historian 
Friedrich 
Karl 
von 
Savigny 
[1779–1861] 
was 
active. 
Savigny 
declared 
that 
laws 
cannot 
be 
written 
by 
men; 
laws 
are 
developed 
in 
some 
mystical 
way 
by 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
whole 
unit. 
It 
isn’t 
the 
individual 
that 
thinks—it 
is 
the 
nation 
or 
a 
social 
entity 
which 
uses 
the 
individual 
only 
for 
the 
expression 
of 
its 
own 
thoughts. 
This 
idea 
was 
very 
much 
emphasized 
by 
Marx 
and 
the 
Marxists. 
In 
this 
regard 
the 
Marxists 
were 
not 
followers 
of 
Hegel, 
whose 
main 
idea 
of 
historical 
evolution 
was 
an 
evolution 
toward 
freedom 
of 
the 
individual. 


From 
the 
viewpoint 
of 
Marx 
and 
Engels, 
the 
individual 
was 
a 
negligible 
thing 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
nation. 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
denied 
that 
the 
individual 
played 
a 
role 
in 
historical 
evolution. 
According 
to 
them, 
history 
goes 
its 
own 
way. 
The 
material 
productive 
forces 
go 
their 
own 
way, 
developing 
independently 
of 
the 
wills 
of 
individuals. 
And 
historical 
events 
come 
with 
the 
inevitability 
of 
a 
law 
of 
nature. 
The 
material 
productive 
forces 
work 
like 
a 
director 
in 
an 
opera; 
they 
must 
have 
a 
substitute 
available 
in 
case 
of 
a 
problem, 
as 
the 
opera 
director 
must 
have 
a 
substitute 
if 
the 
singer 
gets 
sick. 



According 
to 
this 
idea, 
Napoleon 
and 
Dante, 
for 
instance, 
were 
unimportant 
—if 
they 
had 
not 
appeared 
to 
take 
their 
own 
special 
place 
in 
history, 
someone 
else 
would 
have 
appeared 
on 
stage 
to 
fill 
their 
shoes. 


To 
understand 
certain 
words, 
you 
must 
understand 
the 
German 
language. 
From 
the 
seventeenth 
century 
on, 
considerable 
effort 
was 
spent 
in 
fighting 
the 
use 
of 
Latin 
words 
and 
in 
eliminating 
them 
from 
the 
German 
language. 
In 
many 
cases 
a 
foreign 
word 
remained 
although 
there 
was 
also 
a 
German 
expression 
with 
the 
same 
meaning. 
The 
two 
words 
began 
as 
synonyms, 
but 
in 
the 
course 
of 
history, 
they 
acquired 
different 
meanings. 
For 
instance, 
take 
the 
word 
Umwälzung, 
the 
literal 
German 
translation 
of 
the 
Latin 
word 
revolution. 
In 
the 
Latin 
word 
there 
was 
no 
sense 
of 
fighting. 
Thus, 
there 
evolved 
two 
meanings 
for 
the 
word 
“revolution”—one 
by 
violence, 
and 
the 
other 
meaning 
a 
gradual 
revolution 
like 
the 
“Industrial 
Revolution.” 
However, 
Marx 
uses 
the 
German 
word 
Revolution 
not 
only 
for 
violent 
revolutions 
such 
as 
the 
French 
or 
Russian 
revolutions, 
but 
also 
for 
the 
gradual 
Industrial 
Revolution. 


Incidentally, 
the 
term 
Industrial 
Revolution 
was 
introduced 
by 
Arnold 
Toynbee 
[1852–1883]. 
Marxists 
say 
that 
“What 
furthers 
the 
overthrow 
of 
capitalism 
is 
not 
revolution—look 
at 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution.” 


Marx 
assigned 
a 
special 
meaning 
to 
slavery, 
serfdom, 
and 
other 
systems 
of 
bondage. 
It 
was 
necessary, 
he 
said, 
for 
the 
workers 
to 
be 
free 
in 
order 
for 
the 
exploiter 
to 
exploit 
them. 
This 
idea 
came 
from 
the 
interpretation 
he 
gave 
to 
the 
situation 
of 
the 
feudal 
lord 
who 
had 
to 
care 
for 
his 
workers 
even 
when 
they 
weren’t 
working. 
Marx 
interpreted 
the 
liberal 
changes 
that 
developed 
as 
freeing 
the 
exploiter 
of 
the 
responsibility 
for 
the 
lives 
of 
the 
workers. 
Marx 
didn’t 
see 
that 
the 
liberal 
movement 
was 
directed 
at 
the 
abolition 
of 
inequality 
under 
law, 
as 
between 
serf 
and 
lord. 


Karl 
Marx 
believed 
that 
capital 
accumulation 
was 
an 
obstacle. 
In 
his 
eyes, 
the 
only 
explanation 
for 
wealth 
accumulation 
was 
that 
somebody 
had 
robbed 
somebody 
else. 
For 
Karl 
Marx 
the 
whole 
Industrial 
Revolution 
simply 
consisted 
of 
the 
exploitation 
of 
the 
workers 
by 
the 
capitalists. 
According 
to 
him, 
the 
situation 
of 
the 
workers 
became 
worse 
with 
the 
coming 
of 
capitalism. 
The 
difference 
between 
their 
situation 
and 
that 
of 
slaves 
and 
serfs 
was 
only 
that 
the 
capitalist 
had 
no 
obligation 
to 
care 
for 
workers 
who 
were 
no 
longer 
exploitable, 
while 
the 
lord 
was 
bound 
to 
care 
for 
slaves 
and 
serfs. 
This 
is 
another 
of 
the 
insoluble 
contradictions 
in 
the 
Marxian 
system. 
Yet 
it 
is 
accepted 
by 
many 
economists 
today 
without 
realizing 
of 
what 
this 



contradiction 
consists. 


According 
to 
Marx, 
capitalism 
is 
a 
necessary 
and 
inevitable 
stage 
in 
the 
history 
of 
mankind 
leading 
men 
from 
primitive 
conditions 
to 
the 
millennium 
of 
socialism. 
If 
capitalism 
is 
a 
necessary 
and 
inevitable 
step 
on 
the 
road 
to 
socialism, 
then 
one 
cannot 
consistently 
claim, 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
Marx, 
that 
what 
the 
capitalist 
does 
is 
ethically 
and 
morally 
bad. 
Therefore, 
why 
does 
Marx 
attack 
the 
capitalists? 


Marx 
says 
part 
of 
production 
is 
appropriated 
by 
the 
capitalists 
and 
withheld 
from 
the 
workers. 
According 
to 
Marx, 
this 
is 
very 
bad. 
The 
consequence 
is 
that 
the 
workers 
are 
no 
longer 
in 
a 
position 
to 
consume 
the 
whole 
production 
produced. 
A 
part 
of 
what 
they 
have 
produced, 
therefore, 
remains 
unconsumed; 
there 
is 
“underconsumption.” 
For 
this 
reason, 
because 
there 
is 
underconsumption, 
economic 
depressions 
occur 
regularly. 
This 
is 
the 
Marxian 
underconsumption 
theory 
of 
depressions. 
Yet 
Marx 
contradicts 
this 
theory 
elsewhere. 


Marxian 
writers 
do 
not 
explain 
why 
production 
proceeds 
from 
simpler 
to 
more 
and 
more 
complicated 
methods. 


Nor 
did 
Marx 
mention 
the 
following 
fact: 
About 
1700, 
the 
population 
of 
Great 
Britain 
was 
about 
five 
and 
a 
half 
million; 
by 
the 
middle 
of 
1700, 
the 
population 
was 
six 
and 
a 
half 
million, 
about 
500,000 
of 
whom 
were 
simply 
destitute. 
The 
whole 
economic 
system 
had 
produced 
a 
“surplus” 
population. 
The 
surplus 
population 
problem 
appeared 
earlier 
in 
Great 
Britain 
than 
on 
continental 
Europe. 
This 
happened, 
first 
of 
all, 
because 
Great 
Britain 
was 
an 
island 
and 
so 
was 
not 
subject 
to 
invasion 
by 
foreign 
armies, 
which 
helped 
to 
reduce 
the 
populations 
in 
Europe. 
The 
wars 
in 
Great 
Britain 
were 
civil 
wars, 
which 
were 
bad, 
but 
they 
stopped. 
And 
then 
this 
outlet 
for 
the 
surplus 
population 
disappeared, 
so 
the 
numbers 
of 
surplus 
people 
grew. 
In 
Europe 
the 
situation 
was 
different; 
for 
one 
thing, 
the 
opportunity 
to 
work 
in 
agriculture 
was 
more 
favorable 
than 
in 
England. 


The 
old 
economic 
system 
in 
England 
couldn’t 
cope 
with 
the 
surplus 
population. 
The 
surplus 
people 
were 
mostly 
very 
bad 
people—beggars 
and 
robbers 
and 
thieves 
and 
prostitutes. 
They 
were 
supported 
by 
various 
institutions, 
the 
poor 
laws,1 
and 
the 
charity 
of 
the 
communities. 
Some 
were 
impressed 
into 
the 
army 
and 
navy 
for 
service 
abroad. 
There 
were 
also 
superfluous 
people 
in 
agriculture. 
The 
existing 
system 
of 
guilds 
and 
other 
monopolies 
in 
the 
processing 
industries 
made 
the 
expansion 
of 
industry 
impossible. 
In 
those 
pre-capitalist 
ages, 
there 
was 
a 
sharp 
division 
between 



the 
classes 
of 
society 
who 
could 
afford 
new 
shoes 
and 
new 
clothes, 
and 
those 
who 
could 
not. 
The 
processing 
industries 
produced 
by 
and 
large 
for 
the 
upper 
classes. 
Those 
who 
could 
not 
afford 
new 
clothes 
wore 
hand-me-downs. 
There 
was 
then 
a 
very 
considerable 
trade 
in 
secondhand 
clothes—a 
trade 
which 
disappeared 
almost 
completely 
when 
modern 
industry 
began 
to 
produce 
also 
for 
the 
lower 
classes. 
If 
capitalism 
had 
not 
provided 
the 
means 
of 
sustenance 
for 
these 
“surplus” 
people, 
they 
would 
have 
died 
from 
starvation. 
Smallpox 
accounted 
for 
many 
deaths 
in 
pre-capitalist 
times; 
it 
has 
now 
been 
practically 
wiped 
out. 
Improvements 
in 
medicine 
are 
also 
a 
product 
of 
capitalism. 


What 
Marx 
called 
the 
great 
catastrophe 
of 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution 
was 
not 
a 
catastrophe 
at 
all; 
it 
brought 
about 
a 
tremendous 
improvement 
in 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
people. 
Many 
survived 
who 
wouldn’t 
have 
survived 
otherwise. 
It 
is 
not 
true, 
as 
Marx 
said, 
that 
the 
improvements 
in 
technology 
are 
available 
only 
to 
the 
exploiters 
and 
that 
the 
masses 
are 
living 
in 
a 
state 
much 
worse 
than 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution. 
Everything 
the 
Marxists 
say 
about 
exploitation 
is 
absolutely 
wrong! 
Lies! 
In 
fact, 
capitalism 
made 
it 
possible 
for 
many 
persons 
to 
survive 
who 
wouldn’t 
have 
otherwise. 
And 
today 
many 
people, 
or 
most 
people, 
live 
at 
a 
much 
higher 
standard 
of 
living 
than 
that 
at 
which 
their 
ancestors 
lived 
100 
or 
200 
years 
ago. 


During 
the 
eighteenth 
century, 
there 
appeared 
a 
number 
of 
eminent 
authors—the 
best 
known 
was 
Adam 
Smith 
[1723–1790]—who 
pleaded 
for 
freedom 
of 
trade. 
And 
they 
argued 
against 
monopoly, 
against 
the 
guilds, 
and 
against 
privileges 
given 
by 
the 
king 
and 
Parliament. 
Secondly, 
some 
ingenious 
individuals, 
almost 
without 
any 
savings 
and 
capital, 
began 
to 
organize 
starving 
paupers 
for 
production, 
not 
in 
factories 
but 
outside 
the 
factories, 
and 
not 
for 
the 
upper 
classes 
only. 
These 
newly 
organized 
producers 
began 
to 
make 
simple 
goods 
precisely 
for 
the 
great 
masses. 
This 
was 
the 
great 
change 
that 
took 
place; 
this 
was 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution. 
And 
this 
Industrial 
Revolution 
made 
more 
food 
and 
other 
goods 
available 
so 
that 
the 
population 
rose. 
Nobody 
saw 
less 
of 
what 
really 
was 
going 
on 
than 
Karl 
Marx. 
By 
the 
eve 
of 
the 
Second 
World 
War, 
the 
population 
had 
increased 
so 
much 
that 
there 
were 
60 
million 
Englishmen. 


You 
can’t 
compare 
the 
United 
States 
with 
England. 
The 
United 
States 
began 
almost 
as 
a 
country 
of 
modern 
capitalism. 
But 
we 
may 
say 
by 
and 
large 
that 
out 
of 
eight 
people 
living 
today 
in 
the 
countries 
of 
Western 
civilization, 
seven 
are 
alive 
only 
because 
of 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution. 
Are 
you 
personally 
sure 
that 
you 
are 
the 
one 
out 
of 
eight 
who 
would 
have 
lived 



even 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution? 
If 
you 
are 
not 
sure, 
stop 
and 
consider 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution. 


The 
interpretation 
given 
by 
Marx 
to 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution 
is 
applied 
also 
to 
the 
interpretation 
of 
the 
“superstructure.” 
Marx 
said 
the 
“material 
productive 
forces,” 
the 
tools 
and 
machines, 
produce 
the 
“production 
relations,” 
the 
social 
structure, 
property 
rights, 
and 
so 
forth, 
which 
produce 
the 
“superstructure,” 
the 
philosophy, 
art, 
and 
religion. 
The 
“superstructure,” 
said 
Marx, 
depends 
on 
the 
class 
situation 
of 
the 
individuals, 
i.e., 
whether 
he 
is 
a 
poet, 
painter, 
and 
so 
on. 
Marx 
interpreted 
everything 
that 
happened 
in 
the 
spiritual 
life 
of 
the 
nation 
from 
this 
point 
of 
view. 
Arthur 
Schopenhauer 
[1788–1860] 
was 
called 
a 
philosopher 
of 
the 
owners 
of 
common 
stock 
and 
bonds. 
Friedrich 
Nietzsche 
[1844–1900] 
was 
called 
the 
philosopher 
of 
big 
business. 
For 
every 
change 
in 
ideology, 
for 
every 
change 
in 
music, 
art, 
novel 
writing, 
play 
writing, 
the 
Marxians 
had 
an 
immediate 
interpretation. 
Every 
new 
book 
was 
explained 
by 
the 
“superstructure” 
of 
that 
particular 
day. 
Every 
book 
was 
assigned 
an 
adjective—“bourgeois” 
or 
“proletarian.” 
The 
bourgeoisie 
were 
considered 
an 
undifferentiated 
reactionary 
mass. 


Don’t 
think 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
a 
man 
to 
practice 
all 
his 
life 
a 
certain 
ideology 
without 
believing 
in 
it. 
The 
use 
of 
the 
term 
“mature 
capitalism” 
shows 
how 
fully 
persons, 
who 
don’t 
think 
of 
themselves 
as 
Marxian 
in 
any 
way, 
have 
been 
influenced 
by 
Marx. 
Mr. 
and 
Mrs. 
Hammond, 
in 
fact 
almost 
all 
historians, 
have 
accepted 
the 
Marxian 
interpretation 
of 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution.2 
The 
one 
exception 
is 
Ashton.3 


Karl 
Marx, 
in 
the 
second 
part 
of 
his 
career, 
was 
not 
an 
interventionist; 
he 
was 
in 
favor 
of 
laissez 
faire. 
Because 
he 
expected 
the 
breakdown 
of 
capitalism 
and 
the 
substitution 
of 
socialism 
to 
come 
from 
the 
full 
maturity 
of 
capitalism, 
he 
was 
in 
favor 
of 
letting 
capitalism 
develop. 
In 
this 
regard 
he 
was, 
in 
his 
writings 
and 
in 
his 
books, 
a 
supporter 
of 
economic 
freedom. 


Marx 
believed 
that 
interventionist 
measures 
were 
unfavorable 
because 
they 
delayed 
the 
coming 
of 
socialism. 
Labor 
unions 
recommended 
interventions 
and, 
therefore, 
Marx 
was 
opposed 
to 
them. 
Labor 
unions 
don’t 
produce 
anything 
anyway 
and 
it 
would 
have 
been 
impossible 
to 
raise 
wage 
rates 
if 
producers 
had 
not 
actually 
produced 
more. 


Marx 
claimed 
interventions 
hurt 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
workers. 
The 
German 
socialists 
voted 
against 
[Otto 
von] 
Bismarck’s 
social 
reforms 
that 
he 
instituted 
circa 
1881 
(Marx 
died 
in 
1883). 
And 
in 
this 
country 
the 
Communists 
were 
against 
the 
New 
Deal. 
Of 
course, 
the 
real 
reason 
for 
their 



opposition 
to 
the 
government 
in 
power 
was 
very 
different. 
No 
opposition 
party 
wants 
to 
assign 
so 
much 
power 
to 
another 
party. 
In 
drafting 
socialist 
programs, 
everybody 
assumes 
tacitly 
that 
he 
himself 
will 
be 
the 
planner 
or 
the 
dictator, 
or 
that 
the 
planner 
or 
dictator 
will 
be 
intellectually 
completely 
dependent 
on 
him 
and 
that 
the 
planner 
or 
dictator 
will 
be 
his 
handyman. 
No 
one 
wants 
to 
be 
a 
single 
member 
in 
the 
planning 
scheme 
of 
somebody 
else. 


These 
ideas 
of 
planning 
go 
back 
to 
Plato’s 
treatise 
on 
the 
form 
of 
the 
commonwealth. 
Plato 
was 
very 
outspoken. 
He 
planned 
a 
system 
ruled 
exclusively 
by 
philosophers. 
He 
wanted 
to 
eliminate 
all 
individual 
rights 
and 
decisions. 
Nobody 
should 
go 
anywhere, 
rest, 
sleep, 
eat, 
drink, 
wash, 
unless 
he 
was 
told 
to 
do 
so. 
Plato 
wanted 
to 
reduce 
persons 
to 
the 
status 
of 
pawns 
in 
his 
plan. 
What 
is 
needed 
is 
a 
dictator 
who 
appoints 
a 
philosopher 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
prime 
minister 
or 
president 
of 
the 
central 
board 
of 
production 
management. 
The 
program 
of 
all 
such 
consistent 
socialists—Plato 
and 
Hitler, 
for 
instance 
—planned 
also 
for 
the 
production 
of 
future 
socialists, 
the 
breeding 
and 
education 
of 
future 
members 
of 
society. 


During 
the 
2300 
years 
since 
Plato, 
very 
little 
opposition 
has 
been 
registered 
to 
his 
ideas. 
Not 
even 
by 
Kant. 
The 
psychological 
bias 
in 
favor 
of 
socialism 
must 
be 
taken 
into 
consideration 
in 
discussing 
Marxian 
ideas. 
This 
is 
not 
limited 
to 
those 
who 
call 
themselves 
Marxian. 


Marxians 
deny 
that 
there 
is 
such 
a 
thing 
as 
the 
search 
for 
knowledge 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
knowledge 
alone. 
But 
they 
are 
not 
consistent 
in 
this 
case 
either, 
for 
they 
say 
one 
of 
the 
purposes 
of 
the 
socialist 
state 
is 
to 
eliminate 
such 
a 
search 
for 
knowledge. 
It 
is 
an 
insult, 
they 
say, 
for 
persons 
to 
study 
things 
that 
are 
useless. 


Now 
I 
want 
to 
discuss 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
ideological 
distortion 
of 
truths. 
Class 
consciousness 
is 
not 
developed 
in 
the 
beginning, 
but 
it 
must 
inevitably 
come. 
Marx 
developed 
his 
doctrine 
of 
ideology 
because 
he 
realized 
he 
couldn’t 
answer 
the 
criticisms 
raised 
against 
socialism. 
His 
answer 
was, 
“What 
you 
say 
is 
not 
true. 
It 
is 
only 
ideology. 
What 
a 
man 
thinks, 
so 
long 
as 
we 
do 
not 
have 
a 
classless 
society, 
is 
necessarily 
a 
class 
ideology—that 
is, 
it 
is 
based 
on 
a 
false 
consciousness.” 
Without 
any 
further 
explanation, 
Marx 
assumed 
that 
such 
an 
ideology 
was 
useful 
to 
the 
class 
and 
to 
the 
members 
of 
the 
class 
that 
developed 
it. 
Such 
ideas 
had 
for 
their 
goal 
the 
pursuit 
of 
the 
aims 
of 
their 
class. 


Marx 
and 
Engels 
appeared 
and 
developed 
the 
class 
ideas 
of 
the 
proletariat. 
Therefore, 
from 
this 
time 
on 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie 
is 



absolutely 
useless. 
Perhaps 
one 
may 
say 
that 
the 
bourgeoisie 
needed 
this 
explanation 
to 
solve 
a 
bad 
conscience. 
But 
why 
should 
they 
have 
a 
bad 
conscience 
if 
their 
existence 
is 
necessary? 
And 
it 
is 
necessary, 
according 
to 
Marxian 
doctrine, 
for 
without 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
capitalism 
cannot 
develop. 
And 
until 
capitalism 
is 
“mature,” 
there 
cannot 
be 
any 
socialism. 


According 
to 
Marx, 
bourgeois 
economics, 
sometimes 
called 
“apologetics 
for 
bourgeois 
production,” 
aided 
them, 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
The 
Marxians 
could 
have 
said 
that 
the 
thought 
the 
bourgeoisie 
gave 
to 
this 
bad 
bourgeois 
theory 
justified, 
in 
their 
eyes, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
exploited, 
the 
capitalist 
mode 
of 
production, 
thus 
making 
it 
possible 
for 
the 
system 
to 
exist. 
But 
this 
would 
have 
been 
a 
very 
un-Marxist 
explanation. 
First 
of 
all, 
according 
to 
Marxian 
doctrine, 
no 
justification 
is 
needed 
for 
the 
bourgeois 
system 
of 
production; 
the 
bourgeoisie 
exploit 
because 
it 
is 
their 
business 
to 
exploit, 
just 
as 
it 
is 
the 
business 
of 
the 
microbes 
to 
exploit. 
The 
bourgeoisie 
don’t 
need 
any 
justification. 
Their 
class 
consciousness 
shows 
them 
that 
they 
have 
to 
do 
this; 
it 
is 
the 
capitalist’s 
nature 
to 
exploit. 


A 
Russian 
friend 
of 
Marx 
wrote 
him 
that 
the 
task 
of 
the 
socialists 
must 
be 
to 
help 
the 
bourgeoisie 
exploit 
better 
and 
Marx 
replied 
that 
that 
was 
not 
necessary. 
Marx 
then 
wrote 
a 
short 
note 
saying 
that 
Russia 
could 
reach 
socialism 
without 
going 
through 
the 
capitalist 
stage. 
The 
next 
morning 
he 
must 
have 
realized 
that, 
if 
he 
admitted 
that 
one 
country 
could 
skip 
one 
of 
the 
inevitable 
stages, 
this 
would 
destroy 
his 
whole 
theory. 
So 
he 
didn’t 
send 
the 
note. 
Engels, 
who 
was 
not 
so 
bright, 
discovered 
this 
piece 
of 
paper 
in 
the 
desk 
of 
Karl 
Marx, 
copied 
it 
in 
his 
own 
handwriting, 
and 
sent 
his 
copy 
to 
Vera 
Zasulich 
[1849–1919], 
who 
was 
famous 
in 
Russia 
because 
she 
had 
attempted 
to 
assassinate 
the 
Police 
Commissioner 
in 
St. 
Petersburg 
and 
been 
acquitted 
by 
the 
jury—she 
had 
a 
good 
defense 
counsel. 
This 
woman 
published 
Marx’s 
note, 
and 
it 
became 
one 
of 
the 
great 
assets 
of 
the 
Bolshevik 
Party. 


The 
capitalist 
system 
is 
a 
system 
in 
which 
promotion 
is 
precisely 
according 
to 
merit. 
If 
people 
do 
not 
get 
ahead, 
there 
is 
bitterness 
in 
their 
minds. 
They 
are 
reluctant 
to 
admit 
that 
they 
do 
not 
advance 
because 
of 
their 
lack 
of 
intelligence. 
They 
take 
their 
lack 
of 
advancement 
out 
on 
society. 
Many 
blame 
society 
and 
turn 
to 
socialism. 
This 
tendency 
is 
especially 
strong 
in 
the 
ranks 
of 
intellectuals. 
Because 
professionals 
treat 
each 
other 
as 
equals, 
the 
less 
capable 
professionals 
consider 
themselves 
“superior” 
to 
nonprofessionals 
and 
feel 
they 
deserve 
more 
recognition 
than 
they 
receive. 
Envy 



plays 
an 
important 
role. 
There 
is 
a 
philosophical 
predisposition 
among 
persons 
to 
be 
dissatisfied 
with 
the 
existing 
state 
of 
affairs. 
There 
is 
dissatisfaction, 
also, 
with 
political 
conditions. 
If 
you 
are 
dissatisfied, 
you 
ask 
what 
other 
kind 
of 
state 
can 
be 
considered. 


Marx 
had 
“anti-talent”—i.e., 
a 
lack 
of 
talent. 
He 
was 
influenced 
by 
Hegel 
and 
Feuerbach, 
especially 
by 
Feuerbach’s 
critique 
of 
Christianity. 
Marx 
admitted 
that 
the 
exploitation 
doctrine 
was 
taken 
from 
an 
anonymous 
pamphlet 
published 
in 
the 
1820s. 
His 
economics 
were 
distortions 
taken 
over 
from 
[David] 
Ricardo 
[1772–1823].4 


Marx 
was 
economically 
ignorant; 
he 
didn’t 
realize 
that 
there 
can 
be 
doubts 
concerning 
the 
best 
means 
of 
production 
to 
be 
applied. 
The 
big 
question 
is, 
how 
shall 
we 
use 
the 
available 
scarce 
factors 
of 
production. 
Marx 
assumed 
that 
what 
has 
to 
be 
done 
is 
obvious. 
He 
didn’t 
realize 
that 
the 
future 
is 
always 
uncertain, 
that 
it 
is 
the 
job 
of 
every 
businessman 
to 
provide 
for 
the 
unknown 
future. 
In 
the 
capitalist 
system, 
the 
workers 
and 
technologists 
obey 
the 
entrepreneur. 
Under 
socialism, 
they 
will 
obey 
the 
socialist 
official. 
Marx 
didn’t 
take 
into 
consideration 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
between 
saying 
what 
has 
to 
be 
done 
and 
doing 
what 
somebody 
else 
has 
said 
must 
be 
done. 
The 
socialist 
state 
is 
necessarily 
a 
police 
state. 


The 
withering 
away 
of 
the 
state 
was 
just 
Marx’s 
attempt 
to 
avoid 
answering 
the 
question 
about 
what 
would 
happen 
under 
socialism. 
Under 
socialism, 
the 
convicts 
will 
know 
that 
they 
are 
being 
punished 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
whole 
society. 


The 
third 
volume 
of 
Das 
Kapital 
was 
filled 
with 
lengthy 
quotations 
from 
the 
hearings 
of 
British 
Parliamentary 
Committees 
on 
money 
and 
banking, 
and 
they 
don’t 
make 
any 
sense 
at 
all.5 
For 
instance, 
“The 
monetary 
system 
is 
essentially 
Catholic, 
the 
credit 
system 
essentially 
Protestant.... 
But 
the 
credit 
system 
does 
not 
emancipate 
itself 
from 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
monetary 
system 
any 
more 
than 
Protestantism 
emancipates 
itself 
from 
the 
foundations 
of 
Catholicism.”6 
Utterly 
nonsensical!

MARXIAN 
DOCTRINE 
DOESN’T 
DENY 
THE 
POSSIBILITY 
OF 
ABSOLUTE 
TRUTH, 
but 
it 
maintains 
that 
absolute 
truth 
can 
be 
attained 
only 
in 
the 
classless 
society. 
Or 
in 
the 
proletarian 
class 
society. 


Lenin’s 
main 
book1, 
or 
at 
least 
his 
most 
voluminous 
book 
(now 
available 
in 
the 
Collected 
Works 
of 
Lenin), 
led 
some 
people 
to 
call 
him 
a 
philosopher. 
Most 
of 
Lenin’s 
critique 
of 
the 
ideas 
of 
his 
adversaries 
consists 
of 
calling 
them 
“bourgeois.” 
Lenin’s 
philosophy 
is 
merely 
a 
restatement 
of 
the 
philosophical 
ideas 
of 
Marx; 
to 
some 
extent 
it 
is 
not 
even 
up 
to 
the 
level 
of 
other 
Russian 
writers 
on 
Marxism. 


Marxist 
theory 
or 
philosophy 
had 
no 
development 
in 
countries 
where 
there 
were 
Communist 
parties. 
Persons 
whom 
we 
call 
Marxians 
consider 
themselves 
merely 
interpreters 
of 
Marx; 
they 
never 
tried 
to 
change 
anything 
in 
Marx. 
However, 
there 
are 
contradictions 
in 
Marx. 
So 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
quote 
passages 
from 
his 
writings 
from 
all 
points 
of 
view. 
The 
influence 
of 
Marx 
on 
all 
authors 
and 
writers 
who 
have 
lived 
since 
Marx 
died 
has 
been 
considerable, 
even 
though 
it 
is 
not 
usually 
admitted 
that 
these 
authors 
were 
influenced 
by 
Marx. 


Although 
Marxians 
considered 
themselves 
solely 
interpreters 
of 
Marx, 
one 
Marxian, 
one 
writer, 
added 
something 
and 
had 
a 
strong 
influence, 
not 
only 
on 
the 
small 
group 
of 
his 
followers, 
but 
also 
on 
other 
authors. 
Georges 
Sorel 
[1847–1922]—not 
to 
be 
confused 
with 
Albert 
Sorel 
[1842–1906]—an 
important 
historian, 
developed 
a 
philosophy 
in 
many 
respects 
different 
from 
the 
Marxian 
philosophy. 
And 
it 
influenced 
political 
action 
and 
philosophic 
thinking. 
Sorel 
was 
a 
timid 
bourgeois 
intellectual, 
an 
engineer. 
He 
retired 
to 
discuss 
these 
things 
with 
his 
friends 
at 
a 
bookshop 
owned 
by 
Charles 
Péguy 
[1873–1914], 
a 
revolutionary 
socialist. 
In 
the 
course 
of 
the 
years, 
Péguy 
changed 
his 
opinions 
and 
at 
the 
end 
of 
his 
life 
he 
was 
a 
very 
ardent 
Catholic 
author. 
Péguy 
had 
serious 
conflicts 
with 
his 
family. 
Péguy 
was 
remarkable 
for 
his 
intercourse 
with 
Sorel. 
Péguy 
was 
a 
man 
of 
action; 
he 
died 
in 
action 
in 



1914 
in 
the 
first 
weeks 
of 
the 
war. 


Sorel 
belonged 
psychologically 
to 
the 
group 
of 
people 
who 
dream 
of 
action 
but 
never 
act; 
he 
didn’t 
fight. 
As 
a 
writer, 
however, 
Sorel 
was 
very 
aggressive. 
He 
praised 
cruelty 
and 
deplored 
the 
fact 
that 
cruelty 
is 
more 
and 
more 
disappearing 
from 
our 
life. 
In 
one 
of 
his 
books, 
Reflections 
on 
Violence, 
he 
considered 
it 
a 
manifestation 
of 
decay 
that 
Marxian 
parties, 
calling 
themselves 
revolutionary, 
had 
degenerated 
into 
parliamentary 
parties. 
Where 
is 
the 
revolution 
if 
you 
are 
in 
Parliament? 
He 
also 
didn’t 
like 
labor 
unions. 
He 
thought 
the 
labor 
unions 
should 
abandon 
the 
hopeless 
venture 
of 
seeking 
higher 
wage 
rates 
and 
should 
adopt, 
instead 
of 
this 
conservative 
pattern, 
the 
revolutionary 
process. 


Sorel 
saw 
clearly 
the 
contradiction 
in 
the 
system 
of 
Marx 
who 
spoke 
of 
revolution 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
and 
then 
said, 
“The 
coming 
of 
socialism 
is 
inevitable, 
and 
you 
cannot 
accelerate 
its 
coming 
because 
socialism 
cannot 
come 
before 
the 
material 
productive 
forces 
have 
achieved 
all 
that 
is 
possible 
within 
the 
frame 
of 
the 
old 
society.” 
Sorel 
saw 
that 
this 
idea 
of 
inevitability 
was 
contradictory 
to 
the 
idea 
of 
revolution. 
This 
is 
the 
contradiction 
all 
socialists 
ask 
themselves 
about—Kautsky, 
for 
one. 
Sorel 
completely 
adopted 
the 
idea 
of 
revolution. 


Sorel 
asked 
of 
the 
labor 
unions 
a 
new 
tactic, 
action 
directe—attack, 
destroy, 
sabotage. 
He 
considered 
these 
aggressive 
policies 
only 
preliminary 
to 
the 
great 
day 
when 
the 
unions 
would 
declare 
a 
“general 
strike.” 
That 
is 
the 
day 
when 
the 
unions 
will 
declare 
“Now 
we 
don’t 
work 
at 
all. 
We 
want 
to 
destroy 
the 
life 
of 
the 
nation 
completely.” 
General 
strike 
is 
only 
a 
synonym 
for 
the 
live 
revolution. 
The 
idea 
of 
action 
directe 
is 
called 
“syndicalism.” 


Syndicalism 
can 
mean 
ownership 
of 
the 
industry 
by 
the 
workers. 
Socialists 
mean 
by 
this 
term 
ownership 
by 
the 
state 
and 
operation 
for 
the 
account 
of 
the 
people. 
Sorel 
wanted 
to 
attain 
this 
by 
revolution. 
He 
didn’t 
question 
the 
idea 
that 
history 
leads 
toward 
socialism. 
There 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
instinct 
that 
pushes 
men 
toward 
socialism, 
but 
Sorel 
accepted 
this 
as 
superstition, 
an 
inner 
urge 
that 
cannot 
be 
analyzed. 
For 
this 
reason 
his 
philosophy 
has 
been 
compared 
with 
that 
of 
Henri 
Bergson’s 
élan 
vital 
(myths, 
fairy 
stories, 
fables, 
legends). 
However, 
in 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Sorel, 
“myth” 
means 
something 
else—a 
statement 
which 
cannot 
be 
criticized 
by 
reason. 


1. 
Socialism 
is 
an 
end. 
2. 
The 
general 
strike 
is 
the 
great 
means. 

Most 
of 
Sorel’s 
writings 
date 
from 
1890 
to 
1910. 
They 
had 
an 
enormous 
influence 
on 
the 
world, 
not 
only 
on 
the 
revolutionary 
socialists, 
but 
also 
on 
the 
royalists, 
supporters 
of 
the 
restoration 
of 
the 
House 
of 
Orange, 
the 
“Action 
française,” 
and 
in 
other 
countries 
the 
“Action 
nationale.” 
But 
all 
these 
parties 
gradually 
became 
a 
little 
bit 
more 
“civilized” 
than 
Sorel 
thought 
they 
should 
be. 


It 
was 
the 
idea 
of 
French 
Syndicalism 
that 
influenced 
the 
most 
important 
movement 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century. 
Lenin, 
Mussolini, 
and 
Hitler 
were 
all 
influenced 
by 
Sorel, 
by 
the 
idea 
of 
action, 
by 
the 
idea 
not 
to 
talk 
but 
to 
kill. 
Sorel’s 
influence 
on 
Mussolini 
and 
Lenin 
has 
not 
been 
questioned. 
For 
his 
influence 
on 
Nazism, 
see 
the 
book 
by 
Alfred 
Rosenberg2 
titled 
The 
Myth 
of 
the 
20th 
Century. 
The 
fundamental 
idea 
of 
racism 
was 
borrowed 
from 
Frenchmen. 
The 
only 
man 
who 
really 
contributed 
something 
to 
the 
Marxian 
idea 
was 
Sorel, 
along 
with 
a 
group 
of 
syndicalists—a 
comparatively 
small 
group 
composed 
exclusively 
of 
intellectuals 
and 
even 
of 
idle 
rich 
and 
intellectuals, 
like 
the 
“penthouse 
Bolshevists” 
of 
New 
York. 
They 
repeated 
again 
and 
again 
that 
only 
the 
workers 
have 
enough 
vigor 
and 
enough 
class 
consciousness 
in 
order 
to 
search 
out 
and 
to 
destroy 
the 
bourgeois 
system. 


The 
center 
of 
Marxian 
activity 
shifted 
from 
Germany 
to 
France. 
The 
greatest 
portion 
of 
Marxian 
writings 
are 
in 
French. 
Sorel’s 
work 
was 
done 
in 
France. 
Outside 
of 
Russia, 
there 
are 
more 
Marxians 
in 
France 
than 
in 
any 
other 
country; 
there 
is, 
however, 
more 
discussion 
of 
communism 
in 
France 
than 
in 
Russia. 
The 
École 
Normale 
Supérieure 
in 
Paris 
was 
an 
important 
center 
of 
Marxian 
teachings. 
Lucien 
Herr 
[1864–1926], 
the 
librarian, 
had 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
influence. 
He 
was 
the 
father 
of 
French 
Marxism. 
As 
former 
students 
of 
École 
Normale 
Supérieure 
became 
more 
and 
more 
important, 
the 
school 
spread 
Marxism 
all 
over 
France. 


By 
and 
large, 
the 
same 
condition 
prevailed 
in 
most 
European 
countries. 
When 
the 
universities 
seemed 
slow 
to 
accept 
Marxism, 
special 
schools 
were 
endowed 
to 
educate 
the 
rising 
generations 
in 
orthodox 
socialism. 
This 
was 
the 
goal 
of 
the 
London 
School 
of 
Economics, 
a 
Fabian 
institution 
founded 
by 
the 
Webbs. 
But 
it 
couldn’t 
avoid 
being 
invaded 
by 
persons 
of 
other 
ideas. 
For 
instance, 
[Friedrich 
A.] 
Hayek 
[1899–1992] 
taught 
for 
some 
years 
at 
the 
London 
School 
of 
Economics. 
This 
was 
the 
case 
in 
all 
countries—European 
countries 
had 
state 
universities. 
People 
generally 
ignored 
the 
fact 
that 
Marxians, 
not 
free 
traders, 
were 
appointed 
by 
the 
Tsar 
at 
the 
imperial 
universities 
in 
Russia. 
These 
professors 
were 
called 
legal, 
or 
better 
“loyal,” 



Marxians. 
When 
the 
Bolshevists 
came 
to 
power 
in 
Russia, 
it 
was 
not 
necessary 
to 
fire 
the 
professors. 


Marx 
didn’t 
see 
any 
differences 
between 
the 
various 
parts 
of 
the 
world. 
One 
of 
his 
doctrines 
was 
that 
capitalism 
is 
one 
stage 
in 
the 
development 
of 
socialism. 
In 
this 
regard, 
there 
are 
some 
nations 
that 
are 
more 
backward 
than 
others. 
But 
capitalism 
was 
destroying 
the 
trade 
barriers 
and 
migration 
barriers 
that 
once 
prevented 
the 
unification 
of 
the 
world. 
Therefore, 
the 
differences 
in 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
various 
countries 
with 
regard 
to 
their 
maturity 
toward 
socialism 
will 
disappear. 


In 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto 
in 
1848, 
Marx 
declared 
that 
capitalism 
was 
destroying 
all 
national 
peculiarities 
and 
unifying 
into 
one 
economic 
system 
all 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
world. 
The 
cheap 
prices 
of 
products 
were 
the 
means 
capitalism 
used 
to 
destroy 
nationalism. 
But 
in 
1848, 
the 
average 
person 
didn’t 
know 
anything 
about 
Asia 
or 
Africa. 
Marx 
was 
even 
less 
informed 
than 
the 
average 
English 
businessman 
who 
knew 
something 
about 
business 
relations 
with 
China 
and 
India. 
The 
only 
attention 
Marx 
gave 
to 
this 
problem 
was 
his 
remark, 
later 
published 
by 
Vera 
Zasulich, 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
it 
might 
be 
possible 
for 
a 
country 
to 
skip 
the 
capitalist 
stage 
and 
proceed 
directly 
to 
socialism. 
Marx 
saw 
no 
distinction 
between 
various 
nations. 
Capitalism, 
feudalism, 
brings 
about 
progressive 
impoverishment 
everywhere. 
Everywhere 
there 
will 
be 
mature 
economies. 
And 
when 
the 
age 
of 
mature 
capitalism 
comes, 
the 
whole 
world 
will 
have 
reached 
socialism. 


Marx 
lacked 
the 
ability 
to 
learn 
by 
observing 
political 
events 
and 
the 
political 
literature 
being 
published 
around 
him. 
For 
him 
practically 
nothing 
existed 
but 
the 
books 
of 
the 
classical 
economists, 
which 
he 
found 
in 
the 
library 
of 
the 
British 
Museum, 
and 
the 
hearings 
of 
the 
British 
Parliamentary 
Commissions. 
He 
didn’t 
even 
see 
what 
was 
going 
on 
in 
his 
own 
neighborhood. 
He 
didn’t 
see 
that 
many 
people 
were 
fighting, 
not 
for 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
but 
for 
the 
principles 
of 
nationality. 


Marx 
completely 
ignored 
this 
principle 
of 
nationality. 
The 
principle 
of 
nationality 
asked 
that 
every 
linguistic 
group 
form 
an 
independent 
state 
and 
that 
all 
the 
members 
of 
such 
a 
group 
should 
be 
recognized 
and 
unified. 
This 
was 
the 
principle 
which 
brought 
about 
the 
European 
conflicts, 
led 
to 
the 
complete 
destruction 
of 
the 
European 
system, 
and 
created 
the 
present-day 
chaos 
in 
Europe. 
The 
principle 
of 
nationality 
doesn’t 
take 
into 
account 
that 
there 
are 
large 
territories 
in 
which 
linguistic 
populations 
are 
mixed. 
Consequently 
there 
were 
struggles 
between 
the 
various 
linguistic 
groups 



which 
finally 
resulted 
in 
the 
situation 
we 
have 
today 
in 
Europe. 
I 
mention 
this 
because 
it 
is 
a 
principle 
of 
government 
which 
was 
unknown 
up 
to 
now. 


According 
to 
this 
principle 
there 
is 
no 
such 
nation 
as 
India. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
this 
principle 
of 
nationality 
will 
break 
India 
up 
into 
many 
independent 
states 
fighting 
one 
another. 
The 
Indian 
Parliament 
uses 
the 
English 
language. 
The 
members 
of 
the 
various 
states 
cannot 
communicate 
with 
one 
another, 
other 
than 
by 
employing 
the 
language 
of 
the 
government, 
a 
language 
which 
they 
have 
practically 
expelled 
from 
their 
country. 
But 
this 
situation 
will 
not 
last 
forever. 


In 
1848, 
when 
the 
Slavs 
of 
Europe 
met 
for 
a 
Panslavist 
Congress 
in 
Moscow, 
they 
had 
to 
speak 
with 
one 
another 
in 
German. 
But 
this 
didn’t 
prevent 
later 
developments 
in 
a 
different 
way. 


Karl 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
didn’t 
like 
the 
nationalistic 
movement 
and 
never 
took 
notice 
of 
it. 
It 
didn’t 
fit 
into 
their 
plans 
or 
schemes. 
If, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
unfriendly 
remarks 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
made 
about 
various 
linguistic 
groups 
of 
Austria-Hungary 
and 
the 
Balkans, 
some 
authors, 
especially 
French 
authors, 
think 
Marx 
was 
a 
forerunner 
of 
National 
Socialism—Nazism—they 
are 
wrong. 
Marx 
said 
that 
what 
he 
wanted 
was 
to 
create 
a 
one-world 
state. 
And 
that 
was 
Lenin’s 
idea 
too. 


By 
1848 
Marx 
had 
already 
assumed 
that 
socialism 
was 
just 
around 
the 
corner. 
Given 
such 
a 
theory, 
there 
was 
no 
reason 
to 
form 
a 
separate 
linguistic 
state. 
Such 
a 
state 
could 
only 
be 
very 
temporary. 
Marx 
simply 
assumed 
that 
the 
age 
of 
nationalities 
would 
come 
to 
an 
end, 
and 
that 
we 
were 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
an 
age 
in 
which 
there 
would 
no 
longer 
be 
differences 
between 
various 
types, 
classes, 
nations, 
linguistic 
groups, 
etc. 
Marx 
absolutely 
denied 
any 
differences 
among 
men. 
Men 
would 
all 
be 
of 
the 
same 
type. 
There 
was 
never 
any 
answer 
in 
Marx 
as 
to 
what 
language 
the 
people 
in 
his 
one-world 
state 
would 
use, 
or 
what 
the 
nationality 
of 
the 
dictator 
would 
be. 


Marx 
was 
furious 
when 
someone 
said 
there 
were 
differences 
between 
men 
in 
the 
same 
nation, 
the 
same 
city, 
the 
same 
branch 
of 
business, 
just 
as 
all 
Marxists 
became 
furious 
when 
someone 
told 
them 
there 
were 
differences 
between 
Englishmen 
and 
Eskimos. 
According 
to 
Marx, 
the 
only 
difference 
was 
due 
to 
education. 
If 
an 
idiot 
and 
Dante 
had 
been 
educated 
in 
the 
same 
way, 
there 
would 
have 
been 
no 
difference 
between 
them. 
This 
idea 
influenced 
Marx’s 
followers, 
and 
it 
is 
still 
one 
of 
the 
guiding 
principles 
of 
American 
education. 
Why 
is 
not 
everybody 
equally 
intelligent? 
Many 
Marxians 
assume 
that 
in 
the 
future 
socialist 
commonwealth 
the 
average 



person 
will 
be 
equal 
in 
talents, 
gifts, 
intelligence, 
artistic 
attainments, 
to 
the 
greatest 
men 
of 
the 
past, 
such 
as 
Trotsky, 
Aristotle, 
Marx, 
and 
Goethe, 
although 
there 
will 
still 
be 
some 
more 
gifted 
people. 


It 
never 
occurred 
to 
Marx 
that, 
in 
the 
best 
case, 
education 
can 
only 
transfer 
to 
the 
pupil 
what 
the 
teacher 
already 
knows. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
Marx, 
it 
wouldn’t 
have 
been 
enough 
for 
him 
to 
have 
been 
educated 
in 
a 
school 
by 
perfect 
Hegelian 
teachers 
because 
then 
everything 
he 
would 
have 
produced 
would 
have 
only 
been 
Hegelianism 
again. 
By 
educating 
people 
in 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
generation 
preceding 
motor 
cars, 
it 
wouldn’t 
have 
been 
possible 
to 
produce 
motor 
cars. 
Education 
can 
never 
bring 
about 
progress 
as 
such. 
That 
some 
people, 
thanks 
to 
their 
positions, 
inheritance, 
education, 
and 
so 
on, 
have 
the 
gift 
to 
go 
one 
step 
farther 
than 
preceding 
generations 
cannot 
be 
explained 
simply 
by 
education. 


Similarly, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
explain 
great 
things 
and 
the 
great 
acts 
of 
some 
men 
simply 
by 
referring 
to 
their 
national 
affiliation. 
The 
problem 
is, 
why 
were 
these 
people 
different 
from 
their 
brothers 
and 
sisters? 
Marx 
simply 
assumed, 
without 
any 
reason, 
that 
we 
are 
now 
living 
in 
the 
age 
of 
internationalism 
and 
that 
all 
national 
traits 
will 
disappear. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
that 
he 
assumed 
that 
specialization 
would 
disappear, 
because 
machines 
can 
be 
operated 
by 
unskilled 
workers, 
he 
assumed 
there 
would 
no 
longer 
be 
any 
differences 
between 
various 
parts 
of 
the 
world 
and 
various 
nations. 
Every 
kind 
of 
conflict 
between 
nations 
was 
interpreted 
as 
the 
consequence 
of 
the 
machinations 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
Why 
do 
Frenchmen 
and 
Germans 
fight? 
Why 
did 
they 
fight 
in 
1870? 
Because 
the 
ruling 
classes 
of 
Prussia 
and 
the 
ruling 
classes 
of 
France 
wanted 
to 
fight. 
But 
this 
had 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
interests 
of 
nations. 


In 
regard 
to 
his 
attitude 
toward 
war, 
Marx 
was, 
of 
course, 
influenced 
by 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
Manchester 
laissez-faire 
liberals. 
In 
using 
the 
term 
“Manchester 
liberalism” 
always 
as 
an 
insult, 
we 
tend 
to 
forget 
the 
essential 
statement 
in 
that 
famous 
declaration 
of 
the 
Manchester 
Congress 
where 
the 
term 
originated. 
It 
was 
said 
there 
that 
in 
the 
world 
of 
free 
trade 
there 
is 
no 
longer 
any 
reason 
for 
nations 
to 
fight 
one 
another. 
If 
there 
is 
free 
trade 
and 
every 
nation 
can 
enjoy 
the 
products 
of 
every 
other 
nation, 
the 
most 
important 
cause 
of 
war 
disappears. 
The 
princes 
are 
interested 
in 
increasing 
the 
territorial 
size 
of 
their 
princely 
province 
to 
get 
greater 
income 
and 
power, 
but 
nations 
as 
such 
are 
not 
interested, 
because 
it 
doesn’t 
make 
any 
difference 
under 
free 
trade. 
And 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
immigration 
barriers 
it 
doesn’t 
matter 
to 
the 



individual 
citizen 
whether 
his 
country 
is 
large 
or 
small. 
Therefore, 
according 
to 
the 
Manchester 
Liberals, 
war 
will 
disappear 
under 
popular 
democratic 
rule. 
The 
people 
will 
not 
then 
be 
in 
favor 
of 
war 
because 
they 
have 
nothing 
to 
win 
—they 
have 
only 
to 
pay 
and 
to 
die 
in 
the 
war. 


It 
was 
this 
idea 
that 
was 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
President 
[Woodrow] 
Wilson 
[1856–1924] 
when 
he 
went 
to 
war 
against 
Germany. 
What 
President 
Wilson 
didn’t 
see 
was 
that 
all 
this 
about 
the 
uselessness 
of 
war 
is 
true 
only 
in 
a 
world 
when 
there 
is 
free 
trade 
between 
the 
nations. 
It 
is 
not 
true 
in 
a 
world 
of 
interventionism. 


Sir 
Norman 
Angell 
[1872–1967] 
still 
argues 
in 
the 
same 
way. 
What 
did 
the 
individual 
Germans 
gain 
in 
1870? 
This 
was 
almost 
true 
then, 
because 
there 
was 
comparatively 
free 
trade. 
But 
today 
the 
situation 
is 
different. 
Italy’s 
own 
policies 
made 
it 
impossible 
for 
Italians, 
in 
the 
world 
of 
interventionism, 
to 
get 
the 
raw 
materials 
they 
needed. 
It 
is 
not 
true 
in 
today’s 
interventionist 
world 
that 
the 
individual 
person 
does 
not 
gain 
something 
from 
war. 


The 
League 
of 
Nations 
is 
one 
of 
the 
great 
failures 
in 
world 
history—and 
there 
have 
been 
many 
failures 
in 
world 
history. 
During 
the 
League’s 
20 
years 
the 
trade 
barriers 
had 
been 
more 
and 
more 
intensified. 
Tariffs 
became 
unimportant 
as 
trade 
barriers 
because 
embargoes 
were 
established. 


Because 
the 
liberals 
said 
war 
was 
no 
longer 
economically 
advantageous 
because 
the 
people 
will 
not 
gain 
anything 
from 
it, 
therefore, 
a 
democratic 
nation 
will 
no 
longer 
be 
eager 
to 
fight 
wars. 
Marx 
assumed 
that 
this 
was 
true 
even 
in 
the 
interventionist 
world 
which 
was 
developing 
under 
his 
very 
eyes. 
This 
was 
one 
of 
the 
fundamental 
errors 
of 
Marxism. 
Marx 
was 
not 
a 
pacifist. 
He 
didn’t 
say 
war 
was 
bad. 
He 
only 
said—because 
the 
liberals 
said 
so—that 
war 
between 
nations 
had 
no 
importance 
or 
meaning 
at 
all. 
He 
said 
war—i.e., 
revolution, 
by 
which 
he 
meant 
civil 
war—was 
necessary. 
Nor 
was 
Friedrich 
Engels 
a 
pacifist; 
he 
studied 
military 
science 
day 
in 
and 
day 
out 
in 
order 
to 
prepare 
himself 
for 
the 
position 
he 
had 
assigned 
himself 
as 
commander-inchief 
of 
all 
nations, 
as 
commander-in-chief 
for 
the 
proletarians 
of 
all 
countries 
united. 
Remember 
that 
he 
participated 
in 
fox 
hunting 
in 
a 
red 
coat, 
which 
he 
told 
Marx 
this 
was 
the 
best 
exercise 
for 
a 
future 
general. 


Because 
of 
this 
idea 
of 
revolution—civil 
war, 
not 
international 
war—the 
Marxian 
International 
began 
to 
discuss 
peace. 
In 
1864 
Marx 
founded 
in 
London 
the 
First 
International. 
A 
group 
of 
persons 
who 
had 
very 
little 
to 
do 
with 
the 
people 
and 
the 
masses 
met 
together. 
There 
was 
a 
secretary 
for 
every 
country. 
The 
secretary 
for 
Italy 
was 
Friedrich 
Engels 
and 
many 
of 
the 
other 



countries 
were 
represented 
by 
persons 
who 
only 
knew 
the 
countries 
they 
represented 
as 
tourists. 
Arguments 
between 
the 
members 
disrupted 
the 
whole 
International. 
Finally 
it 
was 
moved 
to 
the 
United 
States 
and 
then 
fell 
apart 
in 
1876. 


The 
Second 
International 
was 
formed 
in 
Paris 
in 
1869. 
But 
this 
Second 
International 
didn’t 
know 
what 
to 
deal 
with. 
The 
unions 
had 
arisen 
and 
the 
unions 
were 
opposed 
to 
free 
trade 
and 
free 
migration. 
Under 
such 
conditions, 
how 
could 
you 
find 
subjects 
to 
be 
discussed 
at 
an 
international 
congress? 
Then 
they 
decided 
to 
discuss 
peace 
and 
war, 
but 
only 
on 
a 
national 
level. 
They 
said 
they 
were 
all 
proletarians 
and 
they 
agreed 
they 
would 
never 
fight 
the 
wars 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
The 
Germans 
included 
Engels 
and 
Karl 
Kautsky. 
There 
were 
some 
“bad” 
Frenchmen 
in 
the 
group 
who 
asked, 
“What 
do 
you 
mean 
when 
you 
say 
we 
can’t 
defend 
our 
own 
country? 
We 
don’t 
like 
the 
Hohenzollerns.” 
The 
French 
at 
this 
time 
made 
an 
agreement 
with 
the 
Russians 
and 
the 
Germans 
didn’t 
like 
that. 
Every 
few 
years 
there 
was 
such 
an 
international 
congress 
and 
each 
time 
the 
newspapers 
said 
it 
heralded 
the 
end 
of 
war. 
But 
these 
“nice 
fellows” 
didn’t 
discuss 
the 
real 
causes 
of 
friction, 
migration 
barriers, 
etc. 
The 
outbreak 
of 
World 
War 
I 
disrupted 
the 
International 
Congresses. 


What 
Marx 
planned 
was 
a 
revolution. 
But 
what 
really 
happened 
was 
that 
he 
created 
a 
bureaucratic 
organization 
in 
the 
European 
countries 
which 
was, 
by 
and 
large, 
innocent 
because 
it 
lacked 
the 
power 
to 
execute 
its 
theories. 
Then 
there 
developed 
in 
the 
East 
a 
Communist 
organization 
that 
unfortunately 
has 
the 
power 
to 
execute 
people 
and 
to 
threaten 
the 
whole 
world. 
And 
all 
this 
was 
started 
in 
the 
Reading 
Room 
of 
the 
British 
Museum 
in 
London 
by 
a 
man, 
who 
was 
not 
in 
this 
regard 
a 
man 
of 
action, 
but 
who 
was 
able 
to 
bring 
about 
violent 
action. 
It 
was 
the 
timid 
bourgeois 
characters, 
Karl 
Marx 
and 
Georges 
Sorel, 
who 
created 
all 
this 
mischief. 
Most 
of 
the 
violent 
ideas 
of 
our 
times 
have 
come 
from 
men 
who 
themselves 
wouldn’t 
have 
been 
able 
to 
resist 
any 
aggression. 


Wilson 
accepted 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
Manchester 
Liberals, 
namely 
that 
so 
far 
as 
war 
was 
concerned, 
democracies 
don’t 
like 
to 
fight 
wars; 
democracies 
fight 
only 
wars 
of 
defense 
because 
the 
individual 
citizen 
cannot 
expect 
any 
improvement 
of 
his 
conditions 
from 
war, 
not 
even 
if 
his 
country 
is 
victorious. 
But 
Wilson 
didn’t 
see 
that 
this 
was 
true 
only 
in 
a 
world 
of 
free 
trade. 
He 
didn’t 
see 
that 
this 
was 
quite 
different 
already 
in 
the 
age 
in 
which 
he 
lived, 
which 
was 
an 
age 
of 
interventionism. 
He 
didn’t 
realize 
that 
an 
enormous 



change 
in 
economic 
policies 
had 
deprived 
this 
theory 
of 
the 
Manchester 
Liberals 
of 
its 
practicability. 
Trade 
barriers 
were 
comparatively 
innocent 
in 
1914. 
But 
they 
were 
very 
much 
worsened 
during 
the 
years 
of 
the 
League 
of 
Nations. 
While 
free 
traders 
were 
meeting 
with 
the 
League 
in 
Geneva 
and 
talking 
about 
reducing 
trade 
barriers, 
people 
at 
home 
were 
increasing 
them. 
In 
1933, 
there 
was 
a 
meeting 
in 
London 
to 
bring 
about 
cooperation 
among 
the 
nations. 
And 
precisely 
at 
this 
time 
the 
richest 
country, 
the 
United 
States, 
nullified 
the 
whole 
thing 
with 
monetary 
and 
financial 
regulations. 
After 
this 
the 
whole 
apparatus 
was 
absolutely 
useless. 


Ricardo’s 
theory 
of 
comparative 
advantage 
is 
that 
it 
is 
to 
the 
advantage 
to 
a 
nation 
to 
have 
free 
trade 
even 
if 
all 
other 
nations 
cling 
to 
their 
trade 
barriers. 
If 
the 
United 
States 
alone 
today 
adopted 
free 
trade 
there 
would 
be 
certain 
changes. 
But 
if 
all 
other 
countries 
clung 
to 
protectionism 
with 
import 
barriers, 
it 
would 
not 
be 
possible 
for 
the 
United 
States 
to 
buy 
more 
goods 
from 
other 
countries. 


There 
are 
isolationists 
not 
only 
in 
this 
country; 
there 
are 
also 
isolationists 
in 
other 
countries. 
Imports 
must 
be 
paid 
for 
by 
exports 
and 
exports 
have 
no 
other 
purpose 
than 
to 
pay 
for 
imports. 
Thus 
the 
establishment 
of 
free 
trade 
by 
the 
richest 
and 
most 
powerful 
nation 
only 
would 
not 
change 
the 
situation 
for 
the 
Italians, 
for 
instance, 
if 
they 
retained 
their 
trade 
barriers. 
It 
would 
not 
make 
any 
difference 
for 
other 
countries 
either. 
It 
is 
advantageous 
for 
any 
country 
to 
have 
free 
trade 
even 
if 
all 
other 
countries 
do 
not, 
but 
the 
problem 
is 
to 
remove 
the 
barriers 
of 
the 
other 
countries. 


The 
term 
“socialism,” 
when 
it 
was 
new 
in 
the 
second 
part 
of 
the 
1830s, 
meant 
exactly 
the 
same 
as 
“communism”—i.e., 
the 
nationalization 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
“Communism” 
was 
the 
more 
popular 
term 
in 
the 
beginning. 
Slowly 
the 
term 
“communism” 
fell 
into 
oblivion 
and 
the 
term 
“socialism” 
came 
into 
use 
almost 
exclusively. 


Socialist 
parties, 
social 
democratic 
parties, 
were 
formed 
and 
their 
fundamental 
dogma 
was 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto. 
In 
1918, 
Lenin 
needed 
a 
new 
term 
to 
distinguish 
his 
group 
of 
socialists 
from 
those 
groups 
which 
he 
called 
“social 
traitors.” 
So 
he 
gave 
to 
the 
term 
“communism” 
a 
new 
meaning; 
he 
used 
it 
to 
refer, 
not 
to 
the 
final 
goal 
of 
socialism 
and 
communism, 
but 
only 
to 
the 
tactical 
means 
for 
attaining 
them. 
Until 
Stalin, 
communist 
meant 
simply 
a 
better 
method—the 
revolutionary 
method—as 
against 
the 
peaceful, 
socialist, 
method 
of 
the 
“socialist 
traitors.” 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
1920s, 
without 
great 
success, 
Stalin 
in 
the 
Third 
International 
tried 
to 
give 
a 
different 



meaning 
to 
the 
term 
“communism.” 
However, 
Russia 
is 
still 
called 
the 
Union 
of 
the 
Soviet 
Socialist 
Republics 
(USSR). 


In 
a 
letter, 
Karl 
Marx 
distinguished 
between 
two 
stages 
of 
socialism— 
the 
lower 
preliminary 
stage 
and 
the 
higher 
stage. 
But 
Marx 
didn’t 
give 
different 
names 
to 
these 
two 
stages. 
At 
the 
higher 
stage, 
he 
said, 
there 
will 
be 
such 
an 
abundance 
of 
everything 
that 
it 
will 
be 
possible 
to 
establish 
the 
principle 
“to 
everybody 
according 
to 
his 
needs.” 
Because 
foreign 
critics 
noticed 
differences 
in 
the 
standards 
of 
living 
of 
various 
members 
of 
the 
Russian 
Soviets, 
Stalin 
made 
a 
distinction. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
1920s 
he 
declared 
that 
the 
lower 
stage 
was 
“socialism” 
and 
the 
higher 
stage 
was 
“communism.” 
The 
difference 
was 
that 
at 
the 
lower 
socialist 
stage 
there 
was 
inequality 
in 
the 
rations 
of 
the 
various 
members 
of 
the 
Russian 
Soviets; 
equality 
will 
be 
attained 
only 
in 
the 
later, 
communist, 
stage.

TH 
LECTURE 



Marxism 
and 
the 
Manipulation 
of 
Man 


IT 
IS 
AN 
ASTONISHING 
FACT 
that 
a 
philosophy 
like 
Marxism, 
which 
attacks 
the 
whole 
social 
system, 
remained 
for 
many 
decades 
more 
or 
less 
unattacked 
and 
uncontested. 
Karl 
Marx 
was 
not 
very 
well 
known 
in 
his 
lifetime 
and 
his 
writings 
remained 
practically 
unknown 
to 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
his 
contemporaries. 
The 
great 
socialists 
of 
his 
age 
were 
other 
men—for 
instance, 
Ferdinand 
Lassalle. 
Lassalle’s 
agitations 
lasted 
only 
a 
year 
because 
he 
was 
killed 
in 
duel 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
private 
affair, 
but 
he 
was 
considered 
a 
great 
man 
in 
his 
age. 
Marx, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
was 
more 
or 
less 
unknown. 
People 
neither 
approved, 
nor 
criticized, 
his 
teachings. 
He 
died 
in 
1883. 
After 
his 
death, 
there 
appeared 
the 
first 
part 
of 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
critique 
of 
the 
economic 
doctrines 
of 
Karl 
Marx.1 
And 
later 
in 
the 
1890s, 
when 
the 
last 
volume 
of 
Das 
Kapital 
was 
published, 
there 
appeared 
the 
second 
part 
of 
this 
critique, 
which 
completely 
killed 
Marx’s 
economic 
doctrines.2 
The 
most 
orthodox 
Marxians 
tried 
to 
revive 
and 
restate 
his 
doctrines. 
But 
there 
was 
practically 
no 
sensible 
critique 
of 
the 
philosophical 
doctrines 
of 
Karl 
Marx. 


Marx’s 
philosophical 
doctrines 
became 
popular 
in 
that 
people 
became 
familiar 
with 
some 
of 
his 
terms, 
slogans, 
and 
so 
forth, 
although 
they 
used 
them 
differently 
from 
the 
way 
they 
were 
used 
in 
the 
system 
of 
Karl 
Marx. 
Such 
simplification 
happens 
to 
many 
doctrines. 
For 
instance, 
Darwinism 
became 
known 
as 
the 
theory 
based 
on 
the 
idea 
that 
man 
is 
the 
grandson 
of 
an 
ape. 
What 
remains 
of 
Nietzsche 
is 
not 
much 
more 
than 
his 
term 
“superman,” 
which 
later 
acquired 
popularity 
in 
the 
United 
States 
without 
any 
connection 
to 
Nietzsche. 
Regarding 
Marx, 
people 
know 
his 
terms 
but 
they 
use 
them 
very 
loosely. 
But 
by 
and 
large, 
Marxian 
ideas 
have 
little 
or 
no 
opposition. 


One 
of 
the 
reasons 
why 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Marx 
was 
so 
diluted 
in 
the 
public 
mind 
was 
the 
way 
Engels 
tried 
to 
explain 
Marxian 
theory. 
See 
his 
statement 
at 
the 
graveside 
of 
Marx: 
“Marx 
discovered 
the 
law 
of 
mankind’s 
historical 
evolution, 
i.e., 
the 
simple 
fact, 
hitherto 
hidden 
beneath 
ideological 
overgrowths, 
that 
men 
must 
first 
of 
all 
eat, 
drink, 
have 
shelter 
and 
clothing 



before 
they 
can 
pursue 
politics, 
science, 
art, 
religion, 
and 
the 
like.”3 
Yet 
no 
one 
ever 
denied 
this. 
But 
now 
if 
someone 
says 
something 
against 
Marxian 
doctrine 
then 
they 
can 
be 
asked: 
“How 
can 
you 
be 
so 
stupid 
as 
to 
deny 
that 
one 
must 
first 
eat 
before 
one 
becomes 
a 
philosopher?” 


Again 
there 
is 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
material 
productive 
forces. 
But 
no 
explanation 
is 
offered 
for 
their 
formation. 
Dialectical 
materialism 
states 
that 
the 
material 
productive 
forces 
come 
to 
the 
world—one 
doesn’t 
know 
how 
they 
come, 
nor 
where 
they 
come 
from—and 
it 
is 
these 
material 
productive 
forces 
that 
create 
everything 
else, 
i.e., 
the 
superstructure. 


People 
sometimes 
believe 
that 
there 
has 
been 
a 
very 
sharp 
conflict 
between 
the 
various 
churches 
and 
Marxism. 
They 
consider 
Marxism 
and 
socialism 
as 
incompatible 
with 
the 
teachings 
of 
all 
Christian 
churches 
and 
sects. 
The 
early 
communist 
sects 
and 
early 
monastic 
communities 
were 
based 
on 
a 
peculiar 
interpretation 
of 
the 
Bible 
in 
general, 
and 
of 
the 
book 
of 
Acts 
especially. 
We 
don’t 
know 
much 
about 
these 
early 
communist 
sects 
but 
they 
existed 
in 
the 
Middle 
Ages 
and 
also 
in 
the 
early 
years 
of 
the 
Reformation. 
All 
these 
sects 
were 
in 
conflict 
with 
the 
established 
doctrines 
of 
their 
churches 
or 
denominations. 
So 
it 
would 
be 
absolutely 
wrong 
to 
make 
the 
Christian 
church 
responsible 
for 
them. 
I 
mention 
this 
to 
show 
that, 
at 
least 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
some 
groups, 
most 
of 
which 
the 
church 
considered 
heretical, 
there 
is 
no 
absolute 
conflict 
between 
socialism 
and 
the 
teachings 
of 
the 
church. 
The 
anti-
Christian 
tendencies 
of 
the 
socialist 
forerunners 
of 
Karl 
Marx, 
of 
Karl 
Marx 
himself; 
and 
later 
of 
his 
followers, 
the 
Marxians, 
must 
first 
of 
all 
be 
understood 
within 
the 
whole 
framework 
which 
later 
gave 
rise 
to 
modern 
socialism. 


The 
states, 
the 
governments, 
the 
conservative 
parties, 
were 
not 
always 
opposed 
to 
socialism. 
On 
the 
contrary; 
the 
personnel 
of 
a 
government 
has 
a 
tendency 
or 
a 
bias 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
expansion 
of 
government 
power; 
one 
could 
even 
say 
that 
there 
is 
an 
“occupational 
disease” 
on 
the 
part 
of 
government 
personnel 
to 
be 
in 
favor 
of 
more 
and 
more 
governmental 
activities. 
It 
was 
precisely 
this 
fact, 
this 
propensity 
of 
governments 
to 
adopt 
socialism—and 
many 
governments 
really 
did 
adopt 
socialism—that 
brought 
Marxism 
into 
conflict 
with 
the 
various 
governments. 


I 
have 
pointed 
out 
that 
the 
worst 
thing 
that 
can 
happen 
to 
a 
socialist 
is 
to 
have 
his 
country 
ruled 
by 
socialists 
who 
are 
not 
his 
friends. 
This 
was 
the 
case 
with 
respect 
to 
Karl 
Marx 
and 
the 
Prussian 
government. 
The 
Prussian 
government 
was 
not 
against 
socialism. 
Ferdinand 
Lassalle 
attacked 
the 
liberal 



parties 
of 
Prussia, 
which 
were 
at 
that 
time 
fighting 
a 
great 
constitutional 
battle 
against 
the 
Hohenzollern 
kings, 
headed 
by 
Bismarck. 
The 
majority 
in 
Prussia 
at 
that 
time 
was 
against 
the 
government; 
the 
government 
couldn’t 
get 
a 
majority 
in 
the 
Prussian 
Parliament. 
The 
Prussian 
government 
was 
not 
very 
strong 
at 
that 
time. 
The 
King 
and 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
ruled 
the 
country 
without 
consent, 
without 
the 
cooperation 
of 
the 
Parliament. 
This 
was 
the 
case 
in 
the 
early 
1860s. 
As 
an 
illustration 
of 
the 
weakness 
of 
the 
Prussian 
government, 
Bismarck, 
in 
his 
Memoirs, 
reported 
a 
conversation 
he 
had 
with 
the 
King. 
Bismarck 
said 
he 
would 
defeat 
the 
Parliament 
and 
the 
liberals. 
The 
King 
answered, 
“Yes, 
I 
know 
how 
that 
will 
end. 
Here 
in 
the 
square 
in 
front 
of 
the 
palace. 
First 
they 
will 
execute 
you 
and 
then 
they 
will 
execute 
me.” 


Queen 
Victoria 
[1819–1901], 
whose 
oldest 
daughter 
[Victoria, 
1840– 
1901] 
had 
married 
the 
royal 
prince 
of 
Prussia, 
was 
not 
very 
pleased 
by 
these 
developments; 
she 
was 
convinced 
that 
the 
Hohenzollerns 
would 
be 
defeated. 
At 
this 
critical 
moment 
Ferdinand 
Lassalle, 
who 
was 
at 
the 
head 
of 
a 
labor 
movement 
which 
was 
then 
still 
very 
modest, 
very 
small, 
came 
to 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
Hohenzollern 
government. 
Lassalle 
had 
meetings 
with 
Bismarck 
and 
they 
“planned” 
socialism. 
They 
introduced 
state 
aid, 
production 
cooperatives, 
nationalization, 
and 
general 
manhood 
suffrage. 
Later 
Bismarck 
really 
embarked 
on 
a 
program 
of 
social 
legislation. 
The 
greatest 
rival 
of 
the 
Marxians 
was 
the 
Prussian 
government, 
and 
they 
fought 
with 
every 
possible 
movement. 


Now 
you 
must 
realize 
that 
in 
Prussia, 
the 
Prussian 
Church, 
the 
Protestant 
Church, 
was 
simply 
a 
department 
of 
the 
government, 
administered 
by 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Cabinet—the 
Minister 
of 
Education 
and 
Affairs 
of 
Culture. 
One 
of 
the 
councilors 
in 
the 
lower 
levels 
of 
the 
administration 
dealt 
with 
the 
problems 
of 
the 
church. 
The 
church 
in 
this 
regard 
was 
a 
state 
church; 
it 
was 
even 
a 
state 
church 
in 
its 
origin. 
Until 
1817, 
there 
were 
Lutherans 
and 
Calvinists 
in 
Prussia. 
The 
Hohenzollerns 
didn’t 
like 
this 
state 
of 
affairs. 
The 
Lutherans 
were 
in 
the 
majority 
in 
the 
old 
Prussian 
territories, 
but 
in 
the 
newly 
acquired 
territories 
there 
were 
both 
groups. 
In 
spite 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
whole 
Prussian 
people 
were 
Lutherans, 
the 
electorate 
of 
the 
Brandenburgs 
had 
changed 
from 
Lutherans 
to 
Calvinists. 
The 
Hohenzollerns 
were 
Calvinists, 
but 
they 
were 
the 
head 
of 
the 
Lutheran 
Church 
in 
their 
country. 
Then 
in 
1817, 
under 
Frederick 
Wilhelm 
III 
of 
Prussia, 
the 
two 
churches 
were 
merged 
to 
form 
the 
Prussian 
Union 
Church. 
The 
Church 
was 
a 
branch 
of 
the 
country’s 
government. 



From 
the 
seventeenth 
century 
on 
in 
Russia, 
the 
church 
was 
simply 
a 
department 
of 
the 
government. 
The 
church 
was 
not 
independent. 
Dependence 
of 
the 
church 
on 
the 
secular 
power 
was 
one 
of 
the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
Eastern 
Church 
at 
Constantinople. 
The 
head 
of 
the 
Eastern 
Empire 
was 
in 
fact 
the 
Superior 
of 
the 
Patriarch. 
This 
same 
system 
was 
to 
some 
extent 
carried 
over 
into 
Russia, 
but 
there 
the 
church 
was 
only 
a 
part 
of 
the 
government. 
Therefore, 
if 
you 
attacked 
the 
church, 
you 
also 
attacked 
the 
government. 


The 
third 
country 
in 
which 
the 
problem 
was 
very 
critical 
was 
Italy, 
where 
the 
nationalist 
unification 
implied 
the 
abolition 
of 
the 
secular 
rule 
of 
the 
Pope. 
Until 
the 
second 
part 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
the 
central 
part 
of 
Italy 
was 
ruled 
independently 
by 
the 
Pope. 
In 
1860, 
the 
king 
of 
Sardinia 
conquered 
these 
states. 
The 
Pope 
retained 
only 
Rome, 
under 
the 
protection 
of 
a 
detachment 
of 
the 
French 
Army 
until 
1860, 
when 
the 
French 
had 
to 
withdraw 
to 
fight 
Prussia. 
Therefore, 
there 
was 
a 
very 
violent 
feud 
between 
the 
Catholic 
Church 
and 
the 
Italian 
secular 
state. 
The 
struggle 
of 
the 
Church 
against 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 
Marxians 
concerning 
religion 
is 
something 
different 
from 
their 
struggle 
against 
the 
socialist 
program. 
Today 
it 
is 
complicated 
even 
more 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Russian 
Church, 
the 
Oriental 
Orthodox 
Church, 
came 
as 
it 
seems, 
to 
some 
agreement 
with 
the 
Bolsheviks. 
The 
struggle 
in 
the 
East 
is 
to 
a 
great 
extent 
a 
struggle 
between 
the 
Eastern 
Church 
and 
the 
Western 
Church—a 
continuation 
of 
the 
struggle 
that 
originated 
more 
than 
a 
thousand 
years 
ago 
between 
the 
two 
churches. 
Therefore, 
the 
conflicts 
in 
these 
countries, 
between 
Russia 
and 
the 
western 
boundaries 
of 
the 
Iron 
Curtain, 
are 
very 
complicated. 
It 
is 
not 
only 
a 
struggle 
against 
totalitarian 
economic 
methods 
for 
economic 
freedom; 
it 
is 
also 
a 
struggle 
of 
various 
nationalities, 
of 
different 
linguistic 
groups. 
Consider, 
for 
instance, 
the 
attempts 
of 
the 
present 
Russian 
government 
to 
make 
the 
various 
Baltic 
nationalities 
over 
into 
Russians—a 
continuation 
of 
something 
that 
had 
been 
started 
by 
the 
Tsars—and 
the 
struggle 
in 
Poland, 
Czechoslovakia, 
Hungary, 
and 
so 
on, 
against 
the 
attempts 
of 
the 
Russian 
Church 
to 
bring 
them 
back, 
as 
they 
say, 
to 
the 
Oriental 
Creed. 
To 
understand 
all 
these 
struggles 
one 
needs 
a 
special 
familiarity 
with 
these 
nationalities 
and 
with 
the 
religious 
histories 
of 
these 
parts 
of 
the 
world. 


In 
the 
sixteenth 
and 
seventeenth 
centuries 
there 
were 
changes 
that 
expanded 
the 
size 
of 
the 
territory 
in 
which 
the 
Pope’s 
supremacy 
was 
acknowledged. 
Therefore, 
there 
existed 
a 
Russian 
Church, 
the 
Orthodox 



Church, 
and 
a 
Ukrainian 
or 
Russian 
Catholic 
Church 
which 
acknowledged 
the 
supremacy 
of 
the 
Pope. 
All 
these 
things 
together 
constituted 
the 
great 
religious 
struggles 
of 
the 
East. 
However, 
one 
must 
not 
confuse 
the 
events 
happening 
in 
these 
nationalistic 
and 
religious 
struggles 
with 
the 
fight 
against 
communism. 
For 
instance, 
the 
politicians 
fighting 
against 
the 
Russians 
today 
are 
not 
always, 
or 
at 
least 
not 
in 
most 
cases, 
fighters 
in 
favor 
of 
a 
free 
economic 
system. 
They 
are 
Marxians, 
socialists. 
They 
would 
probably 
like 
to 
have 
a 
totalitarian 
police 
state, 
but 
they 
don’t 
want 
it 
to 
be 
governed 
by 
the 
Russians. 


From 
this 
point 
of 
view, 
one 
cannot 
say 
that 
there 
is 
any 
real 
opposition 
to 
the 
social 
teachings 
and 
social 
programs 
of 
Marxism. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
realize 
that 
there 
isn’t 
necessarily 
always 
a 
connection 
between 
anti-Marxism, 
an 
ideological 
philosophy, 
and 
economic 
freedom. 


One 
of 
the 
outstanding 
contemporaries 
of 
Karl 
Marx 
in 
Germany 
was 
a 
philosopher, 
Friedrich 
Albert 
Lange 
[1828–1875]. 
He 
wrote 
a 
famous 
book, 
The 
History 
of 
Marxism, 
considered 
for 
many 
years, 
not 
only 
in 
Germany 
but 
also 
in 
English-speaking 
countries, 
one 
of 
the 
best 
introductions 
to 
philosophy. 
Lange 
was 
a 
socialist; 
he 
wrote 
another 
book 
about 
socialism. 
In 
his 
book 
he 
didn’t 
criticize 
Marx, 
but 
rather 
materialism. 
Marxian 
materialism 
is 
a 
very 
imperfect 
materialism 
because 
it 
traces 
all 
changes 
back 
only 
to 
something 
which 
is 
itself 
already 
the 
product 
of 
the 
human 
mind. 


It 
is 
important 
to 
stress 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
critiques 
of 
Marxism 
were 
sometimes 
very 
wrong. 
I 
want 
to 
point 
to 
only 
one 
typical 
example. 
This 
is 
the 
popular 
propensity 
of 
anti-Marxians 
to 
consider 
dialectical 
materialism 
and 
Marxism 
as 
something 
belonging 
to 
the 
same 
group 
of 
ideas 
as 
Freudian 
psychoanalysis. 
I 
am 
not 
a 
psychologist, 
but 
I 
only 
have 
to 
point 
out 
how 
mixed 
up 
these 
people 
are 
who 
believe 
that 
materialism 
in 
general 
and 
Marxian 
materialism 
in 
particular 
have 
some 
connection 
with 
Freudian 
psychoanalysis. 


Before 
Sigmund 
Freud 
[1856–1939] 
and 
Josef 
Breuer 
[1842–1925], 
who 
opened 
up 
this 
whole 
method 
of 
thinking, 
began 
to 
develop 
their 
doctrines, 
it 
was 
the 
generally 
uncontested 
assumption 
among 
all 
doctors 
that 
mental 
disabilities 
were 
caused 
by 
pathological 
changes 
in 
the 
human 
body. 
If 
a 
man 
had 
something 
that 
was 
called 
a 
nervous 
or 
mental 
disease 
they 
looked 
for 
some 
bodily 
factor 
that 
brought 
about 
this 
state 
of 
affairs. 
From 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
doctor 
who 
deals 
with 
the 
human 
body 
this 
is 
the 
only 
possible 
interpretation. 
However, 
sometimes 
they 
were 
absolutely 
correct 
when 
they 



said, 
“We 
don’t 
know 
the 
cause.” 
Their 
only 
method 
was 
to 
look 
for 
a 
physical 
cause. 
One 
could 
give 
many 
examples. 
I 
want 
to 
cite 
only 
one. 
It 
happened 
in 
1889, 
just 
a 
few 
years 
before 
the 
first 
book 
of 
Freud 
and 
Breuer 
was 
published. 
An 
eminent 
man 
in 
France 
committed 
suicide. 
For 
political 
reasons 
and 
because 
of 
his 
religion, 
the 
question 
was 
raised 
whether 
or 
not 
he 
was 
sane. 
His 
family 
wanted 
to 
prove 
that 
it 
was 
a 
mental 
disease. 
In 
order 
to 
prove 
his 
mental 
disease 
to 
the 
Church, 
they 
had 
to 
discover 
some 
physical 
cause. 
There 
was 
an 
autopsy 
by 
eminent 
doctors, 
and 
their 
report 
was 
published. 
“We 
discover 
certain 
things 
in 
the 
brain,” 
they 
said; 
“there 
is 
something 
that 
is 
not 
regular.” 
At 
that 
time, 
people 
thought 
that 
if 
a 
man 
doesn’t 
behave 
like 
other 
people 
has 
no 
physical 
sign 
of 
abnormality 
in 
his 
body, 
he 
is 
a 
malingerer. 
Sometimes 
this 
is 
unfortunate, 
because 
one 
can 
only 
discover 
whether 
or 
not 
a 
person 
is 
a 
malingerer 
after 
he 
is 
dead. 
In 
this 
regard, 
psychoanalysis 
brought 
about 
a 
great 
change. 
The 
case 
of 
Crown 
Prince 
Rudolf 
of 
Austria 
[1858–1889], 
who 
committed 
suicide 
at 
Mayerling, 
raised 
similar 
issues.4 


The 
famous 
first 
case 
was 
that 
of 
a 
woman 
who 
was 
paralyzed. 
Yet 
nothing 
could 
be 
discovered 
in 
her 
body 
to 
explain 
her 
situation. 
The 
case 
was 
written 
up 
by 
a 
man 
who 
followed 
the 
advice 
of 
a 
Latin 
poet: 
wait 
nine 
years 
with 
your 
manuscript 
before 
you 
publish. 
Breuer 
got 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
origin 
of 
this 
bodily 
deficiency 
was 
not 
physical 
but 
that 
it 
was 
in 
the 
mind. 
This 
was 
a 
radical 
change 
in 
the 
field 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences; 
such 
a 
thing 
had 
never 
happened 
before—a 
discovery 
that 
mental 
factors, 
ideas, 
superstitions, 
fables, 
wrong 
ideas, 
what 
a 
man 
thinks, 
what 
he 
believes, 
can 
bring 
about 
changes 
in 
the 
body. 
This 
was 
something 
that 
all 
the 
natural 
sciences 
had 
denied 
and 
contested 
before. 


Freud 
was 
a 
very 
conscientious 
and 
cautious 
man. 
He 
didn’t 
say, 
“I 
have 
completely 
discredited 
the 
old 
doctrines.” 
He 
said, 
“Perhaps 
one 
day, 
after 
a 
very 
long 
time, 
the 
pathological 
doctors 
will 
discover 
that 
ideas 
are 
already 
the 
product 
of 
some 
physical 
external 
bodily 
factor. 
Then 
psychoanalysis 
will 
no 
longer 
be 
needed 
or 
useful. 
But 
for 
the 
time 
being 
you 
must 
at 
least 
admit 
that 
there 
is 
a 
temporary 
value 
in 
Breuer’s 
and 
my 
discovery 
and 
that, 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
present-day 
science, 
there 
is 
nothing 
that 
confirms 
the 
materialist 
thesis 
that 
every 
idea 
or 
every 
thought 
is 
the 
product 
of 
some 
external 
factor, 
just 
as 
urine 
is 
a 
product 
of 
the 
body. 
Psychoanalysis 
is 
the 
opposite 
of 
materialism; 
it 
is 
the 
only 
contribution 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
materialism 
vs. 
idealism 
that 
has 
come 
from 
empirical 
research 
in 
the 
human 



body. 


We 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
ways 
some 
people 
abuse 
psychoanalysis. 
I 
do 
not 
defend 
those 
psychoanalysts 
who 
try 
to 
explain 
everything 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
certain 
urges, 
among 
which 
the 
sex 
urge 
is 
considered 
the 
most 
important. 
There 
was 
a 
book 
by 
a 
Frenchman 
dealing 
with 
Baudelaire 
[Charles 
Baudelaire, 
1821–1867]. 
Baudelaire 
liked 
to 
spend 
money, 
but 
he 
didn’t 
earn 
money 
because 
publishers 
didn’t 
buy 
his 
poems 
during 
his 
lifetime. 
But 
his 
mother 
had 
money; 
she 
had 
married 
money 
and 
her 
husband 
died 
and 
left 
it 
to 
her. 
Baudelaire 
wrote 
his 
mother 
a 
lot 
of 
letters. 
This 
writer 
found 
all 
sorts 
of 
subconscious 
explanations 
for 
his 
letters. 
I 
don’t 
defend 
this 
attempt. 
But 
his 
letter 
writing 
doesn’t 
need 
any 
further 
explanation 
than 
that 
Baudelaire 
wanted 
money. 


Freud 
said 
he 
didn’t 
know 
anything 
about 
socialism. 
In 
this 
regard 
he 
was 
very 
different 
from 
Einstein 
[1879–1955] 
who 
said, 
“I 
don’t 
know 
anything 
about 
economics, 
but 
socialism 
is 
very 
good.” 


If 
we 
follow 
how 
Marxism 
became 
the 
leading 
philosophy 
of 
our 
age, 
we 
must 
mention 
Positivism 
and 
the 
school 
of 
Auguste 
Comte. 
Comte 
was 
a 
socialist 
similar 
to 
Karl 
Marx. 
In 
his 
youth, 
Auguste 
Comte 
had 
been 
the 
secretary 
of 
Saint-Simon. 
Saint-Simon 
was 
a 
totalitarian 
who 
wanted 
to 
rule 
the 
whole 
world 
by 
world 
council 
and, 
of 
course, 
he 
believed 
he 
would 
be 
the 
president 
of 
this 
world 
council. 
According 
to 
Comte’s 
idea 
of 
world 
history, 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
search 
for 
the 
truth 
in 
the 
past. 
“But 
now, 
I, 
August 
Comte, 
have 
discovered 
the 
truth. 
Therefore, 
there 
is 
no 
longer 
any 
need 
for 
freedom 
of 
thought 
or 
freedom 
of 
the 
press. 
I 
want 
to 
rule 
and 
to 
organize 
the 
whole 
country.” 


It 
is 
very 
interesting 
to 
follow 
the 
origin 
of 
certain 
terms 
which 
are 
today 
so 
familiar 
that 
we 
assume 
they 
must 
have 
been 
in 
the 
language 
from 
time 
immemorial. 
In 
French, 
the 
words 
“organize” 
and 
“organizer” 
were 
unknown 
before 
the 
end 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
century 
or 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century. 
With 
regard 
to 
this 
term, 
“organize,” 
Balzac5 
observed 
“This 
is 
a 
new-fangled 
Napoleonic 
term. 
This 
means 
you 
alone 
are 
the 
dictator 
and 
you 
deal 
with 
the 
individual 
as 
the 
builder 
works 
with 
stones.” 


Another 
new 
term, 
“social 
engineering,” 
deals 
with 
the 
social 
structure. 
The 
social 
engineer 
deals 
with 
the 
social 
structure 
or 
with 
his 
fellowmen 
as 
the 
master 
builder 
deals 
with 
his 
bricks. 
Reasoning 
in 
this 
way, 
the 
Bolsheviks 
eliminate 
those 
individuals 
who 
are 
useless. 
In 
the 
term 
“social 
engineering” 
you 
have 
the 
idea 
of 
planning, 
the 
idea 
of 
socialism. 
Today 
we 



have 
many 
names 
for 
socialism. 
If 
a 
thing 
is 
popular, 
then 
the 
language 
has 
many 
expressions 
for 
it. 
These 
planners 
say 
in 
defense 
of 
their 
ideas, 
you 
must 
plan 
things; 
you 
cannot 
let 
things 
act 
“automatically.” 


Sometimes 
“automatically” 
is 
used 
in 
a 
metaphorical 
sense 
to 
apply 
to 
things 
that 
happen 
on 
the 
market. 
If 
the 
supply 
of 
a 
product 
drops, 
then 
they 
say 
prices 
go 
up 
“automatically.” 
But 
this 
doesn’t 
mean 
that 
this 
is 
done 
without 
human 
consciousness, 
without 
some 
persons 
bidding 
and 
offering. 
Prices 
go 
up 
precisely 
because 
people 
are 
anxious 
to 
acquire 
these 
things. 
Nothing 
in 
the 
economic 
system 
happens 
“automatically.” 
Everything 
happens 
because 
certain 
people 
behave 
in 
a 
definite 
way. 


Also 
the 
planners 
say, 
“How 
can 
you 
be 
so 
stupid 
as 
to 
advocate 
the 
absence 
of 
planning?” 
But 
no 
one 
advocates 
the 
absence 
of 
plan. 
The 
question 
is 
not 
“Plan, 
or 
no 
plan.” 
The 
question 
is 
“Whose 
plan? 
The 
plan 
of 
one 
dictator 
only? 
Or 
the 
plan 
of 
many 
individuals?” 
Everyone 
plans. 
He 
plans 
to 
go 
to 
work; 
he 
plans 
to 
go 
home; 
he 
plans 
to 
read 
a 
book; 
he 
plans 
a 
thousand 
other 
things. 
A 
“great” 
plan 
eliminates 
the 
plans 
of 
everybody 
else; 
then 
only 
one 
plan 
can 
be 
supreme. 
If 
the 
“great” 
plan 
and 
the 
plans 
of 
individuals 
come 
into 
conflict, 
whose 
plan 
is 
to 
be 
supreme? 
Who 
decides? 
The 
police 
decide! 
And 
they 
decide 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
“great” 
plan. 


In 
the 
early 
days 
of 
socialism, 
some 
critics 
of 
socialism 
used 
to 
blame 
socialists 
for 
their 
ignorance 
of 
human 
nature. 
A 
man 
who 
must 
execute 
the 
plan 
of 
somebody 
else 
only 
would 
no 
longer 
be 
a 
man 
of 
the 
kind 
we 
call 
human. 
This 
objection 
was 
answered 
by 
those 
socialists 
who 
said, 
“If 
human 
nature 
is 
against 
socialism, 
then 
human 
nature 
will 
have 
to 
be 
changed.” 
Karl 
Kautsky 
said 
this 
many 
years 
before, 
but 
he 
didn’t 
give 
any 
details. 


The 
details 
were 
provided 
by 
Behaviorism 
and 
by 
[Ivan] 
Pavlov 
[1849– 
1936], 
the 
psychologist 
mentioned 
in 
every 
book 
by 
a 
Marxist. 
The 
explanation 
was 
offered 
by 
Pavlov’s 
conditioned 
reflex. 
Pavlov 
was 
a 
Tsarist; 
he 
made 
his 
experiments 
in 
the 
days 
of 
the 
Tsar. 
Instead 
of 
human 
rights, 
Pavlov’s 
dog 
had 
canine 
rights. 
This 
is 
the 
future 
of 
education. 


The 
Behaviorist 
philosophy 
wants 
to 
deal 
with 
human 
individuals 
as 
if 
there 
were 
no 
ideas 
or 
no 
faults 
in 
men. 
Behaviorism 
considers 
every 
human 
action 
as 
a 
reaction 
to 
a 
stimulus. 
Everything 
in 
the 
physical 
and 
physiological 
nature 
responds 
to 
certain 
reflexes. 
They 
say, 
“Man 
belongs 
to 
the 
same 
realm 
as 
animals. 
Why 
should 
he 
be 
different? 
There 
are 
certain 
reflexes 
and 
certain 
instincts 
that 
guide 
men 
to 
certain 
ends. 
Certain 
stimuli 
bring 
about 
certain 
reactions.” 
What 
the 
Behaviorists 
and 
the 
Marxists 
did 



not 
see 
was 
that 
you 
cannot 
even 
discredit 
such 
a 
theory 
of 
stimuli 
without 
entering 
into 
the 
meaning 
that 
the 
individual 
attaches 
to 
such 
stimuli. 
The 
housewife, 
when 
quoted 
the 
price 
of 
an 
object 
which 
she 
is 
considering 
buying, 
reacts 
differently 
to 
$5 
than 
she 
does 
to 
$6. 
You 
cannot 
determine 
the 
stimulus 
without 
entering 
into 
the 
meaning. 
And 
the 
meaning 
itself 
is 
an 
idea. 


The 
Behaviorists’ 
approach 
says, 
“We 
will 
condition 
the 
other 
people.” 
But 
who 
are 
the 
“we”? 
And 
who 
are 
the 
“other 
people?” 
“Today,” 
they 
say, 
“people 
are 
conditioned 
for 
capitalism 
by 
many 
things, 
by 
history, 
by 
good 
people, 
by 
bad 
people, 
by 
the 
church, 
etc., 
etc.” 


This 
philosophy 
doesn’t 
give 
us 
any 
answer 
other 
than 
the 
answer 
we 
have 
already 
seen. 
The 
whole 
idea 
of 
this 
philosophy 
is 
that 
we 
must 
accept 
what 
Karl 
Marx 
told 
us 
because 
he 
had 
the 
great 
gift—he 
was 
entrusted 
by 
Providence, 
by 
the 
material 
productive 
forces, 
with 
discovering 
the 
law 
of 
historical 
evolution. 
He 
knows 
the 
end 
toward 
which 
history 
leads 
mankind. 
This 
leads 
eventually 
to 
the 
point 
where 
we 
must 
accept 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
party, 
the 
group, 
the 
clique, 
that 
has 
defeated 
the 
others 
by 
force 
of 
arms, 
is 
the 
right 
ruler, 
that 
he 
is 
called 
by 
the 
material 
productive 
forces 
to 
“condition” 
all 
other 
people. 
The 
fantastic 
thing 
is 
that 
the 
school 
which 
develops 
this 
philosophy 
calls 
itself 
“liberal” 
and 
calls 
its 
system 
a 
“people’s 
democracy,” 
“real 
democracy,” 
and 
so 
on. 
It 
is 
also 
fantastic 
that 
the 
Vice 
President 
of 
the 
United 
States 
[Henry 
Wallace, 
1888–1965] 
one 
day 
declared, 
“We 
in 
the 
United 
States 
have 
only 
a 
civil 
rights 
democracy—but 
in 
Russia 
there 
is 
economic 
democracy.” 


There 
was 
a 
socialist 
author, 
valued 
highly 
by 
the 
Bolsheviks 
in 
the 
beginning, 
who 
said 
the 
most 
powerful 
man 
in 
the 
world 
is 
the 
man 
in 
whose 
favor 
the 
greatest 
lies 
are 
told 
and 
believed. 
(Something 
similar 
was 
said 
by 
Adolf 
Hitler.) 
Here 
is 
the 
power 
of 
this 
philosophy. 
The 
Russians 
have 
the 
power 
to 
say, 
“We 
are 
a 
democracy 
and 
our 
people 
are 
happy 
and 
enjoy 
a 
full 
life 
under 
our 
system. 
“And 
other 
nations 
seem 
to 
be 
unable 
to 
find 
the 
right 
answer 
to 
this 
idea. 
If 
they 
had 
found 
the 
right 
answer, 
this 
philosophy 
wouldn’t 
be 
so 
popular. 


There 
are 
people 
living 
here 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
at 
an 
American 
standard 
of 
living, 
who 
think 
they 
are 
unhappy 
because 
they 
do 
not 
live 
in 
Soviet 
Russia 
where, 
they 
say, 
there 
is 
a 
classless 
society 
and 
everything 
is 
better 
than 
it 
is 
here. 
But 
it 
seems 
that 
it 
is 
not 
very 
much 
fun 
to 
live 
in 
Russia, 
not 
only 
from 
the 
material 
point 
of 
view, 
but 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
individual 
freedom. 
If 
you 
ask, 
“How 
is 
it 
possible 
that 
people 
say 



everything 
is 
wonderful 
in 
a 
country, 
Russia, 
in 
which 
everything 
is 
probably 
not 
very 
wonderful,” 
then 
we 
must 
answer, 
“Because 
our 
last 
three 
generations 
were 
unable 
to 
explode 
the 
contradictions 
and 
the 
failures 
of 
this 
philosophy 
of 
dialectic 
materialism.” 


The 
greatest 
philosophy 
in 
the 
world 
today 
is 
that 
of 
dialectical 
materialism--the 
idea 
that 
it 
is 
inevitable 
that 
we 
are 
being 
carried 
toward 
socialism. 
The 
books 
that 
have 
been 
written 
up 
to 
now 
have 
not 
succeeded 
in 
countering 
this 
thesis. 
You 
must 
write 
new 
books. 
You 
must 
think 
of 
these 
problems. 
It 
is 
ideas 
that 
distinguish 
men 
from 
animals. 
This 
is 
the 
human 
quality 
of 
man. 
But 
according 
to 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 
socialists 
the 
opportunity 
to 
have 
ideas 
should 
be 
reserved 
to 
the 
Politburo 
only; 
all 
the 
other 
people 
should 
only 
carry 
out 
what 
the 
Politburo 
tells 
them 
to 
do. 


It 
is 
impossible 
to 
defeat 
a 
philosophy 
if 
you 
do 
not 
fight 
in 
the 
philosophical 
field. 
One 
of 
the 
great 
deficiencies 
of 
American 
thinking—and 
America 
is 
the 
most 
important 
country 
in 
the 
world 
because 
it 
is 
here, 
not 
in 
Moscow, 
that 
this 
problem 
will 
be 
decided—the 
greatest 
shortcoming, 
is 
that 
people 
think 
all 
these 
philosophies 
and 
everything 
that 
is 
written 
in 
books 
is 
of 
minor 
importance, 
that 
it 
doesn’t 
count. 
Therefore 
they 
underrate 
the 
importance 
and 
the 
power 
of 
ideas. 
Yet 
there 
is 
nothing 
more 
important 
in 
the 
world 
than 
ideas. 
Ideas 
and 
nothing 
else 
will 
determine 
the 
outcome 
of 
this 
great 
struggle. 
It 
is 
a 
great 
mistake 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
battle 
will 
be 
determined 
by 
things 
other 
than 
ideas. 


Russian 
Marxists, 
like 
all 
other 
Marxists, 
had 
the 
idea 
that 
they 
wanted 
to 
nationalize 
agriculture. 
That 
is, 
the 
theorists 
wanted 
to—the 
individual 
worker 
did 
not 
want 
to 
nationalize 
the 
farms; 
they 
wanted 
to 
take 
the 
big 
farms, 
break 
them 
up, 
and 
distribute 
the 
land 
among 
the 
small 
farmers. 
This 
has 
been 
called 
“agrarian 
reform.” 
The 
social 
revolutionaries 
wanted 
to 
distribute 
the 
farms 
to 
the 
poor 
peasants. 
In 
1917, 
Lenin 
coined 
a 
new 
slogan, 
“You 
make 
revolution 
with 
the 
slogan 
of 
the 
day.” 
Therefore, 
they 
accepted 
something 
that 
was 
against 
Marxism. 
Later 
they 
started 
the 
nationalization 
of 
farm 
lands. 
Then 
they 
adopted 
this 
idea 
in 
the 
new 
countries 
they 
took 
over; 
they 
told 
every 
man 
that 
he 
would 
get 
his 
own 
farm. 


They 
started 
this 
program 
in 
China. 
In 
China 
they 
took 
the 
big 
farms 
and 
abolished 
the 
rights 
of 
mortgage 
banks 
and 
landlords 
and 
freed 
the 
tenants 
from 
making 
any 
payments 
to 
the 
landlords. 
Therefore, 
it 
was 
not 
philosophy 
that 
made 
the 
Chinese 
peasants 
communistic, 
but 
the 
promise 
of 
a 
better 
life; 
people 
thought 
they 
would 
improve 
their 
conditions 
if 
they 
could 
get 
some 



farm 
land 
owned 
up 
to 
then 
by 
wealthier 
people. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
the 
solution 
for 
the 
Chinese 
problem. 
The 
advocates 
of 
this 
program 
were 
called 
agricultural 
reformers; 
they 
were 
not 
Marxians. 
The 
idea 
of 
land 
distribution 
is 
entirely 
un-Marxian.

[Additional 
comments 
by 
Mises 
during 
the 
question-and-answer 
period] 


Majorities 
are 
also 
not 
godlike. 
“The 
people’s 
voice 
is 
God’s” 
is 
an 
old 
German 
maxim, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
true. 
The 
basis 
of 
the 
idea 
of 
talking 
about 
pleasing 
the 
majority 
is 
that 
in 
the 
long 
run 
the 
majority 
will 
not 
tolerate 
rule 
by 
a 
minority; 
if 
the 
majority 
are 
not 
pleased 
there 
will 
be 
a 
violent 
revolution 
to 
change 
the 
government. 
The 
system 
of 
representative 
government 
is 
not 
radical; 
it 
is 
precisely 
a 
way 
to 
make 
a 
change 
of 
government 
possible 
without 
violence; 
many 
think 
that, 
with 
the 
approval 
of 
the 
people, 
they 
can 
change 
the 
government 
at 
the 
next 
election. 
Majority 
rule 
is 
not 
a 
good 
system 
but 
it 
is 
a 
system 
that 
assures 
peaceful 
conditions 
within 
the 
country. 
Newspapers, 
periodicals, 
books, 
and 
so 
on, 
are 
the 
opinion-makers. 


The 
great 
progress 
of 
the 
modern 
age 
is 
that 
it 
led 
to 
representative 
government. 
The 
great 
pioneer 
of 
this 
idea 
was 
the 
British 
philosopher 
David 
Hume 
[1711–1776],6 
who 
pointed 
out 
that 
in 
the 
long 
run 
government 
is 
not, 
as 
people 
believed, 
based 
on 
military 
power, 
but 
on 
opinion, 
on 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
majority. 
What 
is 
needed 
is 
to 
convince 
the 
majority. 
It 
is 
not 
because 
the 
majority 
is 
always 
right. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
I 
would 
say 
the 
majority 
is 
very 
often 
wrong. 
But 
if 
you 
do 
not 
want 
to 
resort 
to 
a 
violent 
overthrow 
of 
the 
government, 
and 
this 
is 
impossible 
if 
you 
are 
the 
minority 
because 
if 
you 
are 
the 
minority 
they 
will 
overthrow 
you, 
you 
have 
only 
one 
method—to 
talk 
to 
the 
people, 
to 
write, 
and 
to 
talk 
again.

6TH 
LECTURE 



The 
Making 
of 
Modern 
Civilization: 
Savings, 
Investment, 
and 
Economic 
Calculation 


INSTITUTIONALISM1 
used 
to 
ridicule 
the 
classical 
economists 
because 
they 
started 
with 
“Crusoe 
economics.” 
In 
the 
beginning 
a 
fisherman 
got 
the 
idea 
that 
he 
could 
catch 
more 
fish 
one 
day 
than 
he 
needed 
and 
then 
he 
could 
have 
some 
leisure 
time 
to 
manufacture 
fishing 
nets. 
These 
nets 
and 
saved 
fish 
are 
“capital 
goods”; 
I 
don’t 
call 
them 
“capital.” 


Capital 
goods 
are 
the 
intermediate 
factors 
between 
the 
given 
natural 
factors 
of 
production 
and 
consumer 
goods. 
Nature—given 
resources 
and 
human 
labor 
are 
the 
given 
natural 
factors. 
But 
if 
they 
are 
to 
produce, 
they 
must 
be 
guided. 
The 
produced, 
intermediary 
factors 
of 
production—capital 
goods—are 
not 
only 
tools; 
they 
are 
also 
all 
other 
intermediary 
goods, 
half-
finished 
products, 
and 
supplies 
of 
consumer 
goods 
which 
are 
used 
for 
the 
support 
of 
those 
who 
are 
producing 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
capital 
goods. 
The 
production 
process 
which 
we 
are 
organizing 
and 
operating 
today 
started 
in 
the 
early 
ages 
of 
history, 
in 
the 
remotest 
ages 
of 
history. 
If 
the 
children 
used 
up 
the 
nets 
and 
fish 
produced 
by 
their 
parents, 
capital 
accumulation 
would 
have 
had 
to 
start 
all 
over 
again. 
There 
is 
a 
continuous 
progress 
from 
simpler 
conditions 
to 
more 
refined 
conditions. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
realize 
this 
because 
we 
must 
know 
that, 
from 
the 
early 
beginnings 
on, 
the 
first 
step 
toward 
this 
system 
of 
producing 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
capital 
goods 
was 
saving, 
and 
has 
always 
been 
saving. 


The 
concept 
of 
“capital” 
must 
be 
distinguished 
from 
the 
concept 
of 
“capital 
goods.” 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
think 
and 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
problems 
of 
capital 
goods 
without 
using 
and 
referring 
to 
the 
concepts 
which 
we 
have 
developed 
in 
the 
complicated 
modern 
system 
of 
capital 
calculation. 
Capital 
goods 
are 
something 
material—something 
that 
could 
be 
described 
in 
terms 
of 
physics 
and 
chemistry. 
The 
concept 
of 
“capital” 
refers 
to 
the 
valuation 
of 
a 
supply 
of 
these 
capital 
goods 
in 
terms 
of 
money. 
This 
valuation 
of 
capital 



goods 
in 
terms 
of 
money 
is 
what 
marks 
the 
beginning 
of 
what 
may 
be 
called 
a 
new 
and 
higher 
period 
in 
human 
endeavors 
to 
improve 
the 
external 
conditions 
of 
mankind. 
The 
problem 
is 
how 
to 
maintain 
or 
to 
preserve 
the 
amount 
of 
capital 
available 
and 
how 
to 
avoid 
consuming 
the 
available 
capital 
goods 
without 
replacing 
them. 
The 
problem 
is 
how 
not 
to 
consume 
more, 
or 
if 
possible, 
how 
to 
consume 
less, 
than 
the 
amount 
of 
newly 
produced 
products. 
It 
is 
the 
problem 
of 
capital 
preservation, 
maintenance, 
and 
of 
course 
of 
increasing 
the 
capital 
available. 


Under 
some 
circumstances, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
deal 
with 
this 
problem 
without 
any 
special 
calculation 
or 
computation. 
If 
a 
farmer 
continues 
to 
produce 
in 
the 
same 
way 
and 
if 
the 
methods 
of 
construction 
and 
method 
of 
living 
haven’t 
changed, 
he 
can 
estimate 
his 
condition 
because 
he 
can 
establish 
comparisons 
in 
physical 
and 
biological 
terms—two 
barns 
are 
more 
than 
one 
barn, 
a 
dozen 
head 
of 
cattle 
is 
more 
than 
two 
cows, 
and 
so 
on. 
But 
such 
simple 
methods 
of 
computation 
are 
insufficient 
in 
an 
economic 
system 
in 
which 
there 
is 
change 
and 
progress. 
Replacement 
may 
not 
be 
in 
the 
same 
form 
as 
the 
factors 
which 
are 
used 
up. 
Diesel 
engines 
may 
be 
substituted 
for 
steam 
engines, 
and 
so 
on. 
Replacement 
and 
maintenance 
of 
capital 
under 
such 
conditions 
require 
a 
method 
of 
computation 
and 
calculation 
which 
can 
only 
be 
figured 
in 
terms 
of 
money. 
The 
various 
physical 
and 
external 
factors 
of 
production 
cannot 
be 
compared 
in 
any 
other 
way 
than 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
services 
they 
render 
to 
men, 
calculated 
in 
terms 
of 
money. 


It 
was 
one 
of 
the 
fundamental 
errors 
of 
Aristotle 
that 
he 
believed 
that 
in 
exchanges 
the 
things 
which 
were 
exchanged 
must 
have 
the 
same 
value. 
Since 
the 
days 
of 
Aristotle, 
for 
two 
or 
three 
thousand 
years, 
the 
same 
error 
has 
prevailed 
again 
and 
again, 
leading 
great 
thinkers, 
as 
well 
as 
simple 
men, 
astray. 
The 
same 
error 
appears 
in 
the 
first 
pages 
of 
Marx’s 
Das 
Kapital, 
making 
everything 
Marx 
said 
about 
these 
problems 
useless. 
This 
error 
was 
repeated 
even 
much 
later 
in 
the 
writings 
of 
Henri 
Bergson 
[1859-1941], 
the 
eminent 
French 
philosopher. 


There 
is 
no 
equivalence 
in 
exchange. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
it 
is 
differences 
that 
bring 
about 
exchange. 
You 
cannot 
reduce 
the 
terms 
of 
exchange 
and 
of 
trade 
to 
equivalence; 
you 
can 
only 
reduce 
them 
to 
differences 
in 
evaluation. 
The 
buyer 
values 
what 
he 
gets 
more 
highly 
than 
what 
he 
gives 
away; 
the 
seller 
values 
what 
he 
gives 
less 
highly 
than 
what 
he 
gets. 
Therefore, 
the 
equivalence 
that 
we 
use 
in 
determining 
the 
importance 
the 
various 
capital 
goods 
have 
in 
our 
lives 
can 
only 
be 
expressed 
in 
terms 
of 
prices. 
In 



calculating 
in 
terms 
of 
prices 
you 
can 
establish 
a 
system 
of 
prices, 
and 
determine 
whether 
or 
not 
a 
price 
has 
increased 
or 
decreased—that 
is, 
in 
terms 
of 
money. 
Without 
a 
price 
system 
there 
cannot 
be 
any 
calculation. 
In 
the 
socialist 
system, 
which 
cannot 
have 
a 
price 
system 
as 
we 
have 
it 
in 
the 
market 
system, 
there 
cannot 
be 
established 
calculation 
and 
computation. 


In 
the 
system 
of 
economic 
calculation, 
we 
have 
the 
terms 
“capital” 
and 
“income”—terms 
and 
notions 
that 
cannot 
be 
thought 
of 
outside 
this 
system. 
“Capital” 
is 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
prices 
that 
can 
be 
obtained 
on 
the 
market 
for 
a 
definite 
given 
supply 
of 
capital 
goods. 
The 
businessman 
employs 
economic 
calculation 
in 
a 
specific 
way; 
he 
could 
not 
operate 
without 
this 
system 
of 
economic 
calculation. 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
his 
enterprise 
he 
establishes 
a 
total 
value 
of 
all 
the 
capital 
goods 
at 
his 
disposal 
and 
calls 
it 
his 
“capital,” 
or 
the 
“capital” 
of 
his 
firm 
or 
corporation. 
Periodically, 
he 
compares 
the 
value 
of 
the 
prices 
of 
all 
the 
capital 
goods 
available 
in 
the 
firm 
with 
the 
prices 
of 
these 
capital 
goods 
at 
the 
beginning. 
If 
there 
is 
an 
increase 
he 
calls 
it 
“profit.” 
If 
there 
is 
a 
decrease, 
he 
calls 
it 
“loss.” 
No 
other 
system 
would 
make 
it 
possible 
to 
establish 
whether 
what 
has 
been 
done 
has 
increased 
the 
capital 
available, 
improved 
it, 
or 
decreased 
it. 
From 
another 
point 
of 
view, 
the 
total 
surplus 
that 
he 
calls 
“profit” 
can 
also 
be 
called 
“income,” 
insofar 
as 
it 
makes 
it 
possible 
for 
the 
owner—corporation 
or 
individual—to 
consume 
this 
amount 
without 
reducing 
the 
amount 
of 
capital 
available 
and 
without, 
therefore, 
living 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
future. 
Thus 
the 
concepts 
of 
“capital” 
and 
“income” 
developed 
only 
within 
this 
system 
of 
economic 
calculation. 


If 
the 
total 
amount 
of 
“income” 
is 
consumed, 
then 
there 
is 
no 
change 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
capital 
available 
for 
the 
enterprise. 
If 
a 
part 
is 
saved, 
i.e., 
not 
consumed 
but 
reinvested—that 
is, 
if 
it 
is 
used 
to 
expand 
the 
stock 
of 
capital 
goods 
working 
in 
the 
enterprise—then 
we 
can 
say 
additional 
capital 
has 
been 
accumulated; 
the 
enterprise 
has 
earned 
some 
“income.” 
If 
the 
contrary 
is 
the 
case, 
if 
the 
amount 
consumed 
by 
the 
owner 
exceeds 
the 
income, 
then 
we 
have 
capital 
consumption, 
or 
capital 
decumulation, 
and 
there 
will 
be 
less 
available 
in 
the 
future 
for 
the 
production 
of 
consumer 
goods. 


I 
don’t 
want 
to 
enter 
into 
how 
much 
knowledge 
the 
ancient 
Greeks 
and 
Romans 
had 
of 
these 
ideas. 
They 
had 
some 
knowledge 
at 
least, 
but 
by 
the 
Middle 
Ages 
it 
had 
entirely 
disappeared. 
Under 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
Middle 
Ages, 
there 
was 
no 
need 
for 
such 
calculation. 
It 
developed 
slowly, 
step 
by 
step 
in 
the 
latter 
part 
of 
the 
Middle 
Ages 
in 
the 
countries 
in 
which 
at 
that 
time 
economic 
progress 
was 
much 
better 
than 
other 
countries, 
in 
Italy, 
for 



instance. 
As 
a 
result, 
some 
of 
the 
fundamental 
terms 
of 
accountancy 
preserve 
their 
Italian 
origin, 
for 
instance 
the 
word 
“capital” 
itself. 


In 
the 
beginning, 
the 
terms 
of 
accountancy 
were 
not 
very 
clear. 
People 
were 
not 
very 
good 
at 
arithmetic, 
and 
we 
discover 
very 
bad 
errors 
simply 
in 
arithmetical 
problems 
even 
in 
the 
books 
of 
big 
fifteenth-century 
firms. 
Gradually 
these 
ideas 
developed 
more 
and 
more 
until 
the 
system 
of 
double-
entry 
bookkeeping 
was 
developed. 
Our 
whole 
thinking 
is 
now 
influenced 
by 
these 
ideas, 
even 
the 
ideas 
of 
those 
who 
know 
nothing 
of 
the 
problems 
of 
accountancy 
and 
who 
are 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
read 
and 
interpret 
the 
balance 
sheet 
of 
a 
corporation. 
Accountants 
and 
bookkeepers 
are 
only 
the 
handymen 
in 
this 
fundamental 
way 
of 
dealing 
with 
all 
material 
and 
external 
problems. 
However, 
these 
problems 
concern 
others 
than 
accountants 
and 
bookkeepers. 
Goethe, 
who 
was 
a 
great 
poet, 
scientist, 
and 
a 
precursor 
of 
the 
science 
of 
evolution, 
described 
a 
merchant’s 
double-entry 
accounting 
system 
as 
“one 
of 
the 
most 
marvelous 
inventions 
of 
the 
human 
spirit.” 
Goethe 
realized 
these 
ideas 
were 
fundamental 
to 
the 
modern 
system 
of 
producing 
and 
acting 
and 
that 
these 
concepts 
were 
a 
kind 
of 
practical 
mathematics 
and 
logic 
in 
the 
way 
people 
deal 
with 
all 
these 
problems. 


In 
our 
age, 
public 
opinion 
and 
legislation 
have 
completely 
lost 
all 
understanding 
of 
these 
problems. 
This 
is 
due 
to 
modern 
income-tax 
legislation. 
First 
of 
all, 
in 
the 
legislation 
concerning 
income 
taxes, 
the 
lawgiver 
calls 
salaries 
and 
wages 
“income” 
or 
“earned 
income.” 
However, 
the 
main 
characteristic 
of 
“income” 
in 
the 
economic 
sense 
is 
that 
it 
is 
that 
surplus 
over 
a 
businessman’s 
costs 
that 
may 
be 
consumed 
without 
reducing 
capital, 
i.e., 
without 
living 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
future. 
You 
cannot 
consume 
“income” 
without 
deteriorating 
your 
opportunities 
for 
future 
production. 
The 
concepts 
of 
“capital” 
and 
“income” 
developed 
only 
within 
the 
system 
of 
economic 
calculation. 


These 
income-tax 
laws 
also 
deal 
with 
“profits” 
as 
if 
they 
were 
salaries. 
The 
income-tax 
authors 
are 
very 
astonished 
if 
a 
firm 
doesn’t 
have 
a 
profit 
every 
year. 
They 
don’t 
realize 
that 
there 
are 
good 
years 
and 
bad 
years 
for 
an 
enterprise. 
One 
consequence 
was 
that 
during 
the 
depression 
in 
the 
early 
1930s 
people 
used 
to 
say, 
“How 
unjust 
that 
a 
man 
who 
owns 
a 
big 
factory 
doesn’t 
have 
to 
pay 
any 
income 
tax 
this 
year, 
while 
a 
man 
who 
makes 
only 
$300 
a 
month 
has 
to 
pay.” 
It 
was 
not 
unjust 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
law; 
that 
year 
the 
big 
factory 
owner 
had 
no 
“income.” 


The 
authors 
in 
promulgating 
these 
income-tax 
laws 
had 
not 
the 
slightest 



idea 
of 
what 
“capital” 
and 
“income” 
in 
the 
economic 
system 
really 
meant. 
What 
they 
didn’t 
see 
was 
that 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
great 
profits 
and 
great 
incomes 
wasn’t 
spent 
by 
the 
businessmen, 
but 
reinvested 
in 
capital 
goods 
and 
plowed 
back 
into 
the 
enterprise 
to 
increase 
production. 
This 
was 
precisely 
the 
way 
in 
which 
economic 
progress, 
improvement 
in 
material 
conditions, 
took 
place. 
Fortunately 
I 
do 
not 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
income-tax 
laws, 
nor 
with 
the 
mentality 
that 
led 
to 
these 
laws. 
It 
is 
enough 
to 
say 
that, 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
individual 
worker, 
it 
would 
be 
much 
more 
reasonable 
to 
tax 
only 
income 
spent, 
not 
income 
saved 
and 
reinvested. 


In 
many 
cases, 
it 
is 
difficult 
for 
a 
man 
in 
the 
late 
years 
of 
his 
life 
to 
make 
a 
living, 
or 
at 
least 
to 
earn 
as 
much 
as 
he 
had 
earned 
in 
his 
prime. 
To 
make 
it 
simple, 
take 
the 
situation 
of 
singers 
whose 
years 
of 
big 
earning 
are 
definitely 
limited. 


What 
I 
want 
to 
deal 
with 
is 
the 
idea 
that 
saving 
in 
general, 
or 
that 
saving 
under 
special 
circumstances, 
is 
supposedly 
bad 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
welfare 
of 
the 
commonwealth 
and, 
therefore, 
that 
something 
should 
be 
done 
to 
restrict 
saving 
or 
to 
direct 
it 
into 
special 
channels. 
In 
fact, 
we 
may 
say, 
and 
nobody 
can 
deny 
it, 
that 
all 
material 
progress, 
everything 
that 
distinguishes 
our 
conditions 
from 
those 
of 
earlier 
ages, 
is 
that 
more 
has 
been 
saved 
and 
accumulated 
as 
capital 
goods. 
This 
also 
distinguishes 
the 
United 
States 
from, 
let 
us 
say, 
India 
or 
China. 
The 
most 
important 
difference 
is 
only 
a 
difference 
in 
time. 
It 
is 
not 
too 
late 
for 
them. 
We 
just 
started 
earlier 
to 
save 
some 
of 
the 
excess 
of 
production 
over 
consumption. 


The 
most 
important 
institutional 
factor 
in 
the 
development 
of 
nations 
was 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
system 
of 
government 
and 
of 
legislation 
that 
made 
large-scale 
saving 
possible. 
Large-scale 
saving 
was 
impossible 
and 
still 
is 
impossible 
today 
in 
all 
those 
countries 
in 
which 
the 
governments 
believe 
that 
when 
one 
man 
has 
more 
it 
must 
necessarily 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
other 
people’s 
distress. 
This 
was 
once 
the 
idea 
of 
all 
people. 
And 
it 
is 
today 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
people 
in 
many 
countries 
outside 
the 
countries 
of 
Western 
civilization. 
It 
is 
the 
idea 
that 
is 
now 
jeopardizing 
Western 
civilization 
by 
introducing 
different 
methods 
of 
government 
into 
the 
constitutions 
which 
made 
possible 
the 
development 
of 
Western 
civilization. 
It 
was 
also 
the 
idea 
prevailing 
in 
most 
European 
countries 
until 
the 
rise 
of 
modern 
capitalism, 
that 
is, 
until 
the 
age 
very 
inappropriately 
called 
the 
“Industrial 
Revolution.” 


To 
show 
how 
strong 
this 
idea 
was, 
I 
quote 
from 
Immanuel 
Kant 
[1724– 
1804], 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
philosophers—but 
he 
lived 
in 
the 
east, 
in 



Kaliningrad, 
then 
called 
Königsberg: 
“If 
one 
man 
has 
more 
than 
necessary, 
another 
man 
has 
less.” 
This 
is 
mathematically 
perfectly 
true, 
of 
course, 
but 
mathematics 
and 
economics 
are 
two 
different 
things. 
The 
fact 
is 
that 
in 
all 
those 
countries 
in 
which 
people 
believed 
in 
this 
dictum 
and 
in 
which 
governments 
believed 
that 
the 
best 
way 
to 
improve 
conditions 
was 
to 
confiscate 
the 
wealth 
of 
successful 
businessmen—it 
was 
not 
necessary 
to 
confiscate 
the 
wealth 
of 
those 
who 
were 
unsuccessful—in 
all 
those 
countries, 
it 
was 
not 
possible 
to 
save 
and 
invest. 


If 
someone 
asked 
me 
why 
the 
ancient 
Greeks 
did 
not 
have 
railroads, 
I 
would 
answer, 
“Because 
there 
was 
a 
tendency 
in 
those 
days 
to 
confiscate 
wealth. 
Why 
should 
people 
then 
invest? 
“The 
Greek 
philosopher 
Isocrates 
[436–438 
BC] 
made 
some 
speeches 
which 
are 
still 
available 
to 
us. 
He 
said 
if 
a 
wealthy 
citizen 
stood 
trial 
in 
Athens 
he 
had 
no 
chance 
to 
win 
because 
the 
judges 
wanted 
to 
confiscate 
his 
wealth, 
expecting 
this 
would 
improve 
their 
situation. 
Under 
such 
conditions 
there 
couldn’t 
be 
any 
question 
of 
large-scale 
savings. 


Large-scale 
savings 
developed 
only 
from 
the 
eighteenth 
century 
on. 
And 
from 
that 
time 
on 
there 
developed 
also 
those 
institutions 
which 
made 
saving 
and 
investment 
possible, 
not 
only 
by 
the 
well-to-do, 
but 
also 
of 
small 
sums 
by 
the 
poor 
man. 
In 
the 
early 
days 
the 
poor 
man 
could 
save 
only 
by 
hoarding 
coins. 
But 
coins 
don’t 
bear 
any 
interest, 
and 
the 
advantage 
he 
got 
from 
his 
savings 
was 
not 
very 
great. 
Moreover, 
it 
was 
dangerous 
to 
have 
such 
small 
hoards 
in 
his 
regular 
home; 
they 
could 
be 
stolen 
easily 
and 
they 
didn’t 
earn 
anything. 
From 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
on, 
we 
had 
a 
large-
scale 
development 
that 
made 
saving 
possible 
for 
the 
broad 
masses. 


One 
of 
the 
characteristic 
differences 
between 
a 
capitalistic 
and 
a 
precapitalistic 
system 
is 
that 
in 
the 
capitalistic 
system 
even 
those 
who 
are 
not 
very 
well 
off 
are 
owners 
of 
savings 
and 
have 
small 
investments. 
Many 
people 
do 
not 
recognize 
this 
difference. 
Still 
today, 
in 
dealing 
with 
the 
problem 
of 
interest, 
statesmen, 
or 
politicians, 
as 
well 
as 
public 
opinion, 
believe 
that 
creditors 
are 
the 
rich 
and 
the 
debtors 
are 
the 
poor. 
Therefore, 
they 
think 
that 
a 
policy 
of 
easy 
money, 
a 
policy 
of 
lowering 
interest 
rates 
artificially 
by 
government 
interference, 
is 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
poor 
and 
against 
the 
rich. 
In 
fact, 
the 
poor 
and 
the 
less 
well-to-do 
own 
deposits 
with 
savings 
banks, 
have 
bonds, 
insurance 
policies, 
and 
are 
entitled 
to 
pensions. 
According 
to 
a 
newspaper 
account 
today, 
there 
are 
61/2 
million 
owners 
of 
bonds 
(promises 
to 


pay) 
in 
this 
country. 
I 
don’t 
know 
whether 
or 
not 
this 
figure 
is 
accurate. 
But 



nevertheless 
these 
bonds 
are 
widely 
distributed, 
and 
so 
this 
means 
that 
the 
majority 
are 
not 
debtors 
but 
creditors. 
All 
these 
people 
are 
creditors. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
owners 
of 
the 
common 
stock 
of 
a 
corporation 
that 
has 
issued 
bonds, 
or 
is 
indebted 
to 
banks, 
are 
not 
creditors, 
but 
debtors. 
Similarly 
the 
big 
real 
estate 
operator 
who 
has 
a 
big 
mortgage 
is 
also 
a 
debtor. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
no 
longer 
true 
to 
say 
that 
the 
rich 
are 
creditors 
and 
the 
poor 
are 
debtors. 
Conditions 
in 
this 
regard 
have 
changed 
considerably. 


One 
of 
Hitler’s 
great 
rallying 
cries 
was: 
“Do 
away 
with 
interest 
slavery. 
Long 
live 
the 
debtor; 
perish 
the 
creditor.” 
But 
one 
German 
newspaper 
recognized 
the 
error 
in 
this 
and 
wrote 
an 
article 
with 
the 
headline, 
“DO 
YOU 
KNOW 
THAT 
YOU 
YOURSELF 
ARE 
A 
CREDITOR?” 
I 
cannot 
say 
that 
this 
article 
was 
appreciated 
by 
Hitler. 


There 
developed 
some 
years 
ago 
a 
hostility 
to 
saving 
and 
capital 
accumulation. 
This 
opposition 
to 
saving 
can’t 
be 
attributed 
to 
Marx, 
because 
Marx 
didn’t 
understand 
how 
capital 
was 
accumulated. 
Karl 
Marx 
didn’t 
foresee 
the 
development 
of 
large 
corporations 
and 
ownership 
by 
many 
small 
savers. 
A 
Russian 
economist 
who 
was 
influenced 
by 
Marx 
declared 
years 
ago 
that 
the 
whole 
economic 
system 
of 
capitalism 
was 
self-contradictory. 
Instead 
of 
consuming 
everything 
that 
was 
produced, 
a 
great 
part 
of 
the 
things 
produced 
is 
saved 
and 
accumulated 
as 
additional 
capital. 
There 
will 
be 
more 
and 
more 
for 
coming 
generations. 
What 
is 
the 
sense 
of 
this? 
For 
whom 
do 
they 
accumulate 
all 
this? 
Like 
a 
miser 
they 
accumulate, 
but 
who 
will 
enjoy 
what 
the 
saver 
earns? 
It 
is 
ridiculous; 
it 
is 
bad; 
something 
should 
be 
done 
about 
it. 


John 
Maynard 
Keynes 
[1883–1946] 
succeeded 
with 
his 
anti-saving 
program. 
According 
to 
him, 
there 
is 
danger 
in 
over-saving. 
He 
believed, 
and 
many 
people 
accepted 
his 
view, 
that 
opportunities 
for 
investment 
were 
limited. 
There 
may 
not 
be 
sufficient 
investment 
opportunities 
to 
absorb 
all 
the 
income 
that 
is 
set 
aside 
as 
savings. 
Business 
will 
become 
bad 
because 
there 
is 
too 
much 
savings. 
Therefore, 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
save 
too 
much. 


The 
same 
doctrine 
from 
another 
point 
of 
view 
had 
been 
prevalent 
for 
a 
very 
long 
time. 
People 
believed 
that 
a 
new 
invention—a 
labor-saving 
device 
—would 
produce 
what 
was 
called 
“technological 
unemployment.” 
This 
was 
the 
idea 
that 
led 
the 
early 
unions 
to 
destroy 
machines. 
Present-day 
unions 
still 
have 
the 
same 
idea, 
but 
they 
are 
not 
so 
unsophisticated 
as 
to 
destroy 
the 
machines—they 
have 
more 
refined 
methods. 


As 
far 
as 
we 
can 
see, 
human 
wants 
are 
practically 
unlimited. 
What 
we 



need 
to 
fulfill 
satisfactions 
is 
more 
accumulation 
of 
capital 
goods. 
The 
only 
reason 
we 
don’t 
have 
a 
higher 
standard 
of 
living 
in 
this 
country 
is 
that 
we 
don’t 
have 
enough 
capital 
goods 
to 
produce 
all 
the 
things 
that 
people 
would 
like 
to 
have. 
I 
don’t 
want 
to 
say 
that 
people 
always 
make 
the 
best 
use 
of 
economic 
improvements. 
But 
whatever 
it 
is 
that 
you 
want, 
it 
requires 
more 
investment 
and 
more 
manpower 
to 
satisfy 
it. 
We 
could 
improve 
conditions, 
we 
could 
think 
of 
more 
ways 
to 
employ 
capital, 
even 
in 
the 
wealthiest 
parts 
of 
the 
United 
States, 
even 
in 
California. 
There 
will 
always 
be 
plenty 
of 
room 
for 
investment 
as 
long 
as 
there 
is 
scarcity 
of 
the 
material 
factors 
of 
production. 
We 
cannot 
imagine 
a 
state 
of 
affairs 
without 
this 
scarcity. 
We 
cannot 
imagine 
life 
in 
a 
“Land 
of 
Cockaigne,” 
where 
people 
have 
only 
to 
open 
their 
mouths 
and 
let 
food 
enter 
and 
where 
everything 
else 
people 
wanted 
was 
available. 


Scarcity 
of 
the 
factors 
of 
production 
means 
a 
scarcity 
of 
capital 
goods. 
Therefore, 
the 
whole 
idea 
that 
we 
must 
stop 
saving 
and 
start 
spending 
is 
fantastic. 
In 
1931 
or 
1932, 
Lord 
Keynes 
and 
a 
number 
of 
his 
friends 
published 
a 
declaration 
in 
which 
they 
stated 
there 
was 
only 
one 
means 
to 
avoid 
catastrophe 
and 
to 
improve 
economic 
conditions 
immediately—that 
was 
to 
spend, 
spend 
more, 
and 
still 
more. 
Economically 
we 
must 
realize 
that 
spending 
in 
this 
sense 
does 
not 
create 
jobs 
that 
investment 
wouldn’t 
have 
created 
just 
as 
much. 
It 
doesn’t 
matter 
whether 
you 
use 
your 
money 
for 
the 
purchase 
of 
a 
new 
machine 
or 
you 
spend 
it 
in 
a 
night 
club. 
According 
to 
Keynes’s 
theory 
the 
man 
who 
spends 
the 
money 
on 
a 
better 
life 
creates 
jobs, 
while 
the 
man 
who 
buys 
a 
machine 
and 
improves 
production 
is 
withholding 
something 
from 
the 
public. 


It 
is 
not 
true 
that 
when 
Keynes 
wrote 
his 
book 
conditions 
in 
Great 
Britain 
justified 
his 
theory 
of 
government 
spending 
to 
create 
full 
employment. 
What 
created 
the 
unfavorable 
situation 
in 
Great 
Britain 
was 
that 
British 
industries 
after 
World 
War 
I 
did 
not 
have 
the 
means 
required 
to 
improve 
the 
material 
equipment 
in 
their 
factories. 
Therefore, 
the 
British 
machines 
were 
inefficient 
when 
compared 
with 
the 
machines 
in 
some 
other 
countries, 
especially 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
marginal 
productivity 
of 
labor 
was 
lower 
in 
Britain. 
But 
as 
the 
unions 
would 
not 
tolerate 
any 
significant 
reduction 
of 
wage 
rates 
to 
make 
British 
industry 
more 
competitive, 
the 
result 
was 
unemployment. 
What 
Great 
Britain 
needed 
was 
more 
investment 
to 
improve 
the 
productivity 
of 
the 
factors 
of 
production, 
just 
as 
they 
need 
to 
do 
the 
same 
today. 



Lord 
Keynes 
was 
very 
peculiar 
about 
this 
idea. 
An 
American 
friend 
published 
an 
article 
dealing 
with 
his 
personal 
friendship 
with 
Lord 
Keynes. 
He 
tells 
a 
story 
about 
visiting 
Keynes 
in 
a 
Washington 
hotel. 
In 
washing 
his 
hands, 
the 
friend 
was 
very 
careful 
not 
to 
soil 
more 
than 
a 
single 
towel. 
Keynes 
then 
crumpled 
all 
of 
the 
towels 
and 
said 
in 
that 
way 
he 
was 
making 
more 
jobs 
for 
American 
chambermaids. 
From 
this 
point 
of 
view, 
the 
best 
way 
to 
increase 
employment 
would 
be 
to 
destroy 
as 
much 
as 
possible. 
I 
would 
have 
thought 
that 
idea 
had 
been 
demolished 
once 
and 
for 
all 
by 
Frédéric 
Bastiat 
[1801–1850] 
in 
his 
broken 
window 
story.2 
But 
evidently 
Keynes 
didn’t 
understand 
this 
tale 
of 
Bastiat’s. 


The 
fallacy 
that 
labor-saving 
machines 
create 
technological 
unemployment 
has 
not 
only 
been 
disproved 
by 
theoretical 
examination 
but 
also 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
whole 
history 
of 
mankind 
consists 
precisely 
of 
the 
introduction 
of 
more 
and 
more 
labor-saving 
machines. 
Today 
we 
produce 
a 
greater 
amount 
of 
various 
amenities 
with 
a 
smaller 
amount 
of 
human 
labor. 
Yet 
there 
are 
more 
people 
and 
more 
employment. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
not 
true 
that 
people 
are 
deprived 
of 
their 
jobs 
because 
some 
new 
machines 
are 
invented. 


It 
is 
no 
less 
a 
fable, 
and 
it 
is 
also 
a 
very 
bad 
fable, 
that 
the 
accumulation 
of 
capital 
hurts 
the 
workers. 
The 
more 
capital 
goods 
available, 
the 
higher 
the 
marginal 
productivity 
of 
labor—other 
things 
being 
equal. 
If 
an 
employer 
considers 
the 
hiring 
of 
an 
additional 
worker 
or 
the 
firing 
of 
an 
additional 
worker, 
he 
asks 
himself 
what 
the 
employment 
of 
this 
man 
adds 
to 
the 
value 
of 
his 
products. 
If 
the 
employment 
of 
one 
worker 
more 
adds 
something 
to 
the 
quantities 
produced, 
the 
employer’s 
problem 
is, 
does 
his 
employment 
cost 
more 
than 
it 
brings 
from 
the 
sale 
of 
his 
production? 
The 
same 
problem 
arises 
when 
the 
employment 
of 
an 
additional 
amount 
of 
capital 
goods 
is 
considered. 
The 
greater 
amount 
of 
capital 
available 
per 
head 
of 
the 
worker, 
the 
greater 
the 
marginal 
productivity 
of 
the 
worker 
and 
consequently 
the 
higher 
the 
wages 
the 
employer 
can 
pay. 
The 
more 
capital 
accumulated—other 
things 
being 
equal—the 
more 
workers 
can 
be 
employed 
at 
the 
same 
rates, 
or 
at 
higher 
rates. 


Two 
businessmen—J. 
Howard 
Pew 
[1882–1971] 
of 
Sunoco, 
and 
Irving 
Olds 
[1887–1963] 
of 
U. 
S. 
Steel—have 
tried, 
without 
too 
much 
success, 
to 
explain 
to 
other 
businessmen 
the 
effect 
of 
inflation 
on 
their 
capital 
accumulation, 
inventories, 
depreciation, 
and 
so 
forth. 
Inflation 
raises 
the 
businessmen’s 
selling 
prices, 
creating 
the 
illusion 
that 
they 
are 
making 
profits. 
The 
government 
then 
taxes 
and 
uses 
for 
current 
expenses 
these 



apparent 
“profits” 
which 
would 
otherwise 
have 
been 
used 
for 
investment 
or 
set 
aside 
for 
depreciation 
and 
replacement. 


If 
an 
individual 
takes 
out 
a 
policy 
with 
a 
private 
insurance 
company, 
the 
insurance 
company 
invests 
this 
money. 
Later, 
of 
course, 
when 
the 
insurance 
has 
to 
be 
paid 
out, 
it 
has 
to 
disinvest. 
Individuals 
come 
to 
the 
point 
where 
they 
must 
disinvest, 
but 
insurance 
companies 
expand 
from 
year 
to 
year, 
and 
as 
there 
is 
capital 
accumulation 
taking 
place 
in 
the 
whole 
country, 
the 
insurance 
companies 
as 
a 
whole 
do 
not 
have 
to 
disinvest. 


It 
is 
different 
with 
the 
Social 
Security 
system. 
The 
government 
talks 
about 
actuarial 
statistics 
but 
this 
does 
not 
mean 
what 
it 
means 
to 
an 
insurance 
company. 
What 
the 
individual 
pays, 
the 
government 
spends 
for 
current 
expenses. 
The 
government 
then 
gives 
to 
the 
“Social 
Security 
Fund” 
an 
IOU 
which 
it 
calls 
a 
“bond.” 
Thus 
the 
government 
“invests” 
in 
government 
bonds. 
When 
the 
government 
collects 
“Social 
Security” 
taxes, 
it 
says, 
“give 
me 
your 
money 
to 
spend 
and 
in 
return 
I 
promise 
that 
in 
30 
or 
40 
years 
the 
taxpayers 
will 
be 
willing 
to 
pay 
back 
the 
debt 
which 
we 
have 
incurred 
today.” 
Therefore 
the 
Social 
Security 
system 
is 
something 
very 
different 
from 
private 
insurance. 
It 
doesn’t 
mean 
something 
has 
been 
saved. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
savings 
of 
individuals 
are 
collected 
by 
government 
for 
“social 
security” 
but 
they 
are 
used 
for 
current 
expenses. 
I 
am 
fully 
convinced 
the 
government 
will 
pay, 
but 
the 
question 
is, 
in 
what 
kind 
of 
dollars? 
The 
whole 
thing 
depends 
on 
the 
readiness 
of 
future 
Congresses 
and 
the 
future 
public 
to 
pay 
in 
good 
money. 
If 
people 
don’t 
like 
the 
paper 
money, 
they 
won’t 
use 
it. 
For 
instance, 
California 
stayed 
on 
hard 
currency 
during 
the 
Civil 
War 
era 
of 
the 
greenbacks. 


Bismarck’s 
idea 
of 
social 
security 
was 
that 
he 
wanted 
everybody 
to 
receive 
something 
from 
the 
government. 
He 
compared 
the 
situation 
with 
that 
of 
the 
French, 
many 
of 
whom 
owned 
government 
bonds 
and 
received 
interest. 
He 
thought 
that 
was 
why 
the 
French 
were 
so 
patriotic; 
they 
were 
receiving 
something 
from 
the 
government. 
Bismarck 
wanted 
the 
individual 
German, 
too, 
to 
depend 
on 
the 
government. 
So 
he 
started 
an 
additional 
government 
bonus 
of 
50 
Marks 
to 
every 
old-age 
pensioner. 
This 
was 
called 
the 
Reichszuschuss 
[governmental 
supplementary 
allowance]. 


The 
problems 
of 
capital 
are 
problems 
of 
economic 
calculation. 
You 
cannot 
increase 
“capital 
goods” 
by 
inflation, 
although 
you 
can 
seemingly 
increase 
“capital.” 
The 
result 
is 
a 
discrepancy 
between 
capital 
goods 
and 
capital, 
as 
is 
pointed 
out 
by 
economic 
calculation.

7TH 
LECTURE 



Money, 
Interest, 
and 
the 
Business 
Cycle 


THERE 
ARE 
TWO 
PURELY 
THEORETICAL 
PROBLEMS 
which 
have 
had 
serious 
influences 
and 
serious 
consequences 
that 
cannot 
be 
exaggerated. 


The 
first 
of 
these 
two 
problems 
relates 
to 
the 
taking 
of 
interest. 
This 
leads 
us 
back 
to 
Aristotle 
and 
his 
famous 
dictum, 
“Money 
cannot 
beget 
money.” 
Aristotle 
found 
interest 
a 
very 
difficult 
problem. 
He 
was 
responsible 
for 
the 
error 
that 
interest 
was 
paid 
for 
the 
use 
of 
money. 
For 
many 
centuries, 
for 
two 
thousand 
years, 
this 
was 
the 
theoretical 
basis 
of 
the 
legal 
prohibition 
of 
interest-taking 
on 
loans. 
People 
saw 
only 
the 
interest 
on 
loans; 
they 
didn’t 
see 
that 
interest 
stemmed 
from 
a 
general 
category 
of 
human 
action, 
that 
it 
arose 
out 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
all 
people 
by 
necessity, 
without 
any 
exception, 
valued 
present 
goods 
higher 
than 
future 
goods. 
Therefore, 
this 
meant 
that 
the 
discounted 
values 
and 
discounted 
prices 
of 
future 
goods 
as 
against 
present 
goods 
could 
not 
be 
eliminated 
simply 
by 
a 
government 
fiat, 
rule, 
or 
command. 
When 
the 
Roman 
Empire’s 
“capitalism” 
broke 
down 
and 
the 
highly 
developed 
Roman 
economic 
system 
was 
supplanted 
by 
the 
economy 
of 
the 
invading 
tribes—an 
economy 
that 
was 
purely 
agricultural 
and 
based 
on 
the 
self-sufficiency 
of 
every 
householder’s 
farm—the 
general 
prohibition 
against 
the 
taking 
of 
interest 
was 
increasingly 
enforced. 


In 
many 
parts 
of 
Europe 
there 
was 
a 
struggle 
against 
the 
taking 
of 
interest. 
At 
the 
head 
of 
this 
struggle 
was 
the 
Church. 
For 
a 
thousand 
years, 
the 
councils 
of 
the 
Church 
repeated 
the 
unconditional 
prohibition 
of 
interest. 
But 
in 
order 
to 
find 
a 
theoretical 
basis 
for 
this 
prohibition 
they 
could 
not 
use 
the 
Gospels 
and 
the 
New 
Testament—they 
had 
to 
go 
back 
to 
the 
law 
of 
Moses. 
There 
they 
found 
a 
passage 
referring 
to 
the 
taking 
of 
interest 
on 
loans 
lent 
to 
Jews 
and 
not 
to 
Gentiles. 
Later 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
twelfth 
century 
the 
theologians 
found 
a 
passage 
in 
the 
Gospels1which 
could 
also 
be 
interpreted 
as 
being 
against 
interest 
taking. 
This, 
however, 
did 
not 
refer 
specifically 
to 
interest 
taking; 
it 
said, 
“lend, 
hoping 
for 
nothing 
again.” 
I 
think 
that 
translation 
is 
correct. 
This 
raised 
a 
problem 
which 
we 
needn’t 
go 
into, 



but 
which 
was 
contested 
by 
theologians 
and 
historians 
of 
law. 


There 
was 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
the 
prohibition 
of 
the 
Church—the 
Canon 
Law—which 
the 
Church 
was 
very 
eager 
to 
enforce—but 
there 
was 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
reality, 
the 
practice 
of 
the 
people. 
Loans 
were 
needed. 
In 
the 
countries 
under 
the 
power 
of 
the 
Church, 
both 
religious 
and 
secular, 
modern 
banking 
was 
slowly 
developing. 
Theologians 
began 
to 
study 
the 
question 
of 
interest 
to 
determine 
whether 
or 
not 
there 
were 
reasons 
to 
justify 
the 
taking 
of 
interest. 
These 
studies 
were 
the 
beginning 
of 
economic 
law 
versus 
canonistic 
doctrine. 
They 
discussed 
many 
issues, 
and 
at 
least 
eliminated 
the 
erroneous 
belief 
that 
the 
lender 
extracts 
something 
unjust 
from 
the 
borrower 
by 
earning 
interest 
on 
money 
that 
is 
lent. 
Nevertheless 
that 
idea 
is 
still 
found 
in 
many 
American 
textbooks. 


There 
was, 
however, 
another 
question 
and 
that 
question 
was 
this: 
If 
you 
increase 
the 
supply 
of 
money 
that 
is 
available 
for 
lending, 
then 
you 
bring 
about 
on 
the 
money 
market 
(the 
market 
for 
short-term 
loans) 
a 
tendency 
toward 
a 
drop 
in 
the 
rate 
of 
interest. 
If 
interest 
is 
not 
the 
reward 
for 
giving 
a 
man 
the 
use 
of 
a 
certain 
sum 
of 
money 
but 
in 
fact 
depends 
on 
the 
discount 
of 
present 
goods 
against 
future 
goods 
(and 
is 
independent 
of 
whether 
the 
supply 
of 
money 
is 
greater 
or 
smaller), 
how, 
then, 
and 
why 
does 
the 
initial 
drop 
in 
the 
rate 
of 
interest, 
caused 
by 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
supply 
of 
money, 
get 
reversed? 
In 
other 
words, 
notwithstanding 
this 
increased 
supply 
of 
money, 
what 
is 
the 
process 
that 
re-establishes 
a 
rate 
of 
interest 
that 
reflects 
people’s 
evaluations 
concerning 
the 
discount 
of 
future 
against 
present 
goods? 
Some 
people 
denied 
the 
existence 
of 
this 
phenomenon. 
Some 
people 
simply 
declared 
that 
if 
you 
increase 
the 
amount 
of 
money 
or 
money 
substitutes 
you 
can 
bring 
about 
a 
progressive 
tendency 
toward 
a 
further 
and 
further 
drop 
in 
the 
rate 
of 
interest 
until 
interest 
finally 
disappears 
completely. 
There 
are 
actually 
socialist 
authors 
who 
believe 
this 
is 
the 
right 
way 
to 
bring 
about 
abundance, 
to 
create 
plenty 
for 
all, 
and 
make 
everybody 
rich. 


We 
must 
draw 
a 
sharp 
distinction 
between 
two 
types 
of 
bank 
transactions. 
The 
classical 
old 
definition 
of 
a 
banker, 
the 
businessman’s 
and 
economist’s 
definition, 
was 
that 
a 
banker 
was 
a 
man 
who 
loaned 
other 
people’s 
money. 
(A 
man 
who 
lends 
only 
his 
own 
money 
is 
a 
money-lender.) 
The 
banker 
is 
a 
person 
who 
gets 
deposits 
from 
people, 
who 
takes 
other 
people’s 
money, 
and 
lends 
this 
money 
to 
still 
other 
people. 
His 
business 
gains 
are 
derived 
from 
a 
difference 
in 
the 
rate 
of 
interest 
he 
pays 
to 
his 
depositors 
and 
the 
rate 
of 
interest 
he 
gets 
from 
those 
to 
whom 
he 
lends 



money. 
This 
is 
the 
genuine 
business 
of 
banking, 
of 
a 
banker. 


The 
situation 
that 
came 
about 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
with 
the 
development 
of 
modern 
methods 
of 
banking, 
with 
the 
issue 
of 
banknotes 
and 
of 
deposits 
subject 
to 
check, 
led 
to 
two 
serious 
problems: 
fiduciary 
media 
and 
credit 
expansion. 


It 
was 
a 
historical 
evolution 
that 
took 
place 
first 
in 
Great 
Britain, 
and 
then 
also 
in 
other 
countries. 
People 
deposited 
money 
for 
safekeeping 
with 
persons 
whom 
they 
later 
called 
bankers—earlier 
these 
persons 
were 
the 
goldsmiths 
of 
London. 
From 
these 
goldsmiths 
the 
depositors 
got 
receipts 
for 
their 
money 
which 
they 
used 
in 
making 
payments. 
Today, 
we 
would 
call 
these 
receipts 
“banknotes.” 
When 
the 
goldsmith 
concerned 
enjoyed 
favorable 
good 
will, 
there 
was 
no 
reason 
for 
another 
person 
not 
to 
accept 
such 
a 
receipt 
in 
payment 
of 
money 
due 
him. 
The 
goldsmiths 
and 
the 
early 
bankers 
very 
soon 
discovered 
that 
it 
was 
not 
necessary 
to 
keep 
as 
reserves 
in 
their 
vaults 
funds 
amounting 
to 
the 
total 
amount 
of 
the 
receipts 
they 
issued—they 
could 
issue 
more 
receipts, 
more 
banknotes, 
than 
they 
really 
had 
ready 
in 
their 
cash 
holdings. 
They 
discovered 
that 
they 
could 
lend 
a 
part 
of 
their 
reserves, 
that 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
give 
more 
credit 
by 
means 
of 
banking 
operations 
than 
the 
amount 
of 
money 
actually 
deposited 
with 
them 
would 
have 
permitted. 
Thus 
they 
discovered 
what 
we 
would 
call 
“fiduciary 
media.” 


The 
second 
very 
questionable 
business 
consists 
of 
the 
institution 
of 
credit 
expansion, 
which 
may 
be 
called 
the 
most 
important 
economic 
problem 
of 
our 
age. 
This 
means 
that 
the 
banker 
lends 
more 
money 
to 
people 
than 
he 
receives 
from 
his 
depositors. 
This 
surplus 
of 
banknotes 
issued 
by 
the 
banker, 
or 
of 
deposits 
subject 
to 
check 
which 
he 
opens 
for 
his 
customers, 
is 
credit 
expansion. 
The 
question 
is, 
“What 
are 
the 
consequences 
of 
such 
operations?” 
At 
the 
beginning, 
credit 
expansion 
of 
this 
type 
was 
not 
very 
critical, 
not 
very 
dangerous, 
because 
it 
was 
done 
by 
individual 
bankers 
who 
had 
a 
good 
standing 
in 
the 
city 
and 
their 
notes 
could 
be 
taken 
by 
people, 
or 
they 
could 
be 
refused. 
You 
could 
go 
to 
the 
banker 
and 
receive 
from 
him 
a 
loan 
made 
up 
completely 
of 
additional 
banknotes, 
fiduciary 
media, 
made 
up 
completely 
of 
credit 
expansion. 
But 
then 
the 
question 
was, 
would 
your 
customers 
and 
your 
creditors 
really 
be 
ready 
to 
accept 
as 
payment 
the 
banknotes 
issued 
by 
this 
banker? 
We 
may 
assume 
that 
a 
creditor 
who 
has 
a 
questionable 
deal 
would 
answer, 
“It 
is 
better 
to 
take 
these 
notes 
than 
to 
wait 
any 
longer 
for 
payment.” 
But 
then, 
he 
would 
have 
gone 
immediately 
to 
the 
banker 
who 
issued 
the 
notes 
and 
would 
have 
redeemed 
them, 
thus 
reducing 
the 
number 
of 
surplus 



banknotes 
outstanding. 
Therefore, 
the 
dangers 
of 
credit 
expansion 
were 
not 
very 
great 
as 
long 
as 
the 
credit 
expansion 
was 
the 
business 
of 
private 
banks 
and 
private 
businesses 
subject 
to 
commercial 
laws. 
As 
long 
as 
the 
surplus 
banknotes 
could 
be 
returned 
to 
the 
bank 
of 
issue 
for 
redemption, 
there 
was 
a 
check 
on 
credit 
expansion, 
and 
there 
couldn’t 
be 
credit 
expansion 
of 
any 
considerable 
extent. 


But 
very 
soon 
governments 
invaded 
this 
field 
of 
action. 
They 
invaded 
it 
under 
the 
erroneous 
idea 
that 
by 
issuing 
circulation 
credit, 
additional 
credit, 
fiduciary 
media, 
by 
issuing 
more 
money 
than 
they 
had 
received 
from 
the 
public, 
the 
banks 
were 
in 
a 
position, 
precisely 
on 
account 
of 
this 
credit 
expansion, 
to 
reduce 
the 
height 
of 
the 
rate 
of 
interest. 


I 
pointed 
out 
before 
that 
a 
great 
mistake 
concerning 
interest 
was 
inherited 
from 
earlier 
ages. 
It 
was 
a 
correct 
description 
of 
the 
conditions 
in 
ancient 
times 
to 
say 
that 
the 
wealthy 
were 
the 
creditors 
and 
the 
poor 
were 
the 
debtors. 
And 
as 
a 
result 
of 
this, 
the 
idea 
prevailed 
that 
a 
high 
interest 
rate 
was 
bad. 
People 
were 
not 
prepared 
to 
accept 
the 
rate 
of 
interest 
as 
a 
market 
phenomenon 
that 
could 
not 
be 
influenced 
by 
the 
government. 
They 
considered 
the 
interest 
rate 
merely 
as 
an 
obstacle 
to 
economic 
development 
and 
progress. 
Many 
even 
believed 
that 
the 
rate 
of 
interest 
was 
something 
produced 
by 
the 
greed 
of 
selfish 
money-lenders 
and 
that 
it 
was 
the 
duty 
of 
the 
government 
to 
fight 
against 
it. 
The 
development 
of 
modern 
capitalism 
was 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
governments, 
after 
centuries 
and 
centuries 
of 
making 
mistakes, 
finally 
abandoned 
the 
idea 
that 
they 
should 
interfere 
with 
market 
prices, 
wage 
rates, 
and 
so 
on. 
Capitalism 
wouldn’t 
have 
developed 
if 
government 
interference 
with 
prices 
and 
wages 
had 
not 
been 
abandoned 
in 
the 
eighteenth 
century. 
This 
development 
laid 
the 
way 
for 
the 
economic 
improvements 
of 
our 
age. 
However, 
it 
did 
not 
succeed 
completely 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
rate 
of 
interest. 


It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
older 
government 
decrees 
fixing 
maximum 
rates 
of 
interest 
were 
abolished 
in 
the 
age 
of 
liberalism 
and 
capitalism. 
But 
they 
were 
abolished 
only 
because 
governments 
thought 
they 
had 
discovered 
a 
new 
means 
of 
making 
credit 
cheaper, 
i.e., 
through 
credit 
expansion 
by 
the 
banks. 
In 
the 
process, 
private 
bankers 
disappeared 
completely 
from 
this 
business. 
Governments 
gave 
privileges 
to 
governmental 
banks 
that 
had 
the 
monopoly 
of 
the 
issuance 
of 
fiduciary 
media. 
It 
was 
not 
easy 
for 
them 
to 
do 
this, 
because 
there 
was 
some 
resistance. 
Twice 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
the 
efforts 
to 
establish 
a 
United 
States 
bank 
of 
issue 
were 
thwarted 
by 
the 
majority 
of 
the 



population. 


What 
the 
governments 
did 
was 
to 
introduce 
a 
very 
weak 
“middle 
of 
the 
road” 
procedure 
for 
dealing 
with 
the 
problem. 
A 
consistent 
supporter 
of 
this 
system 
of 
credit 
expansion 
would 
have 
said, 
“If 
you 
can 
reduce 
the 
interest 
rate 
by 
credit 
expansion, 
why 
should 
you 
not 
finally 
abolish 
it 
altogether 
and 
make 
the 
rate 
of 
interest 
disappear 
and 
give 
everybody 
loans 
without 
charging 
them 
any 
rate 
of 
interest 
at 
all? 
This 
would 
be 
a 
solution 
to 
the 
social 
problem 
of 
poverty—you 
could 
give 
to 
everybody. 
Why 
not?” 
But 
the 
governments 
did 
not 
believe 
they 
could 
abolish 
the 
rates 
of 
interest 
altogether. 


There 
was 
a 
famous 
exchange 
of 
letters 
between 
the 
French 
socialist 
Pierre-Joseph 
Proudhon 
[1809–1865] 
and 
Frédéric 
Bastiat. 
Proudhon 
was 
an 
opponent 
of 
Bastiat. 
Proudhon 
maintained 
that 
if 
we 
established 
such 
credit-
issuing 
banks, 
then 
we 
could 
make 
the 
rate 
of 
interest 
disappear 
completely. 
Bastiat 
disagreed, 
but 
he 
didn’t 
find 
precisely 
the 
correct 
position; 
he 
endorsed 
a 
“middle 
of 
the 
road” 
solution, 
namely 
that 
interest 
rates 
should 
be 
allowed 
to 
go 
up 
to 
certain 
points 
but 
that 
they 
should 
not 
be 
“too 
high.” 
This 
middle-of-the-road 
position 
became 
later 
the 
generally 
accepted 
doctrine 
of 
the 
world. 
Those 
who 
still 
maintained 
that 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
create 
riches 
for 
all 
by 
credit 
measures 
aimed 
at 
lowering 
or 
eliminating 
interest 
rates 
altogether 
were 
called 
“monetary 
cranks.” 
There 
was 
no 
reason 
to 
call 
them 
monetary 
cranks; 
they 
were 
only 
more 
consistent 
than 
those 
who 
advocated 
the 
official 
middle-of-the-road 
policy. 
Some 
of 
the 
advocates 
of 
lowering 
interest 
rates 
drastically 
were 
very 
eminent 
men, 
eminent 
in 
other 
fields. 
There 
was 
Ernest 
Solvay 
[1838–1922], 
a 
Belgian 
who 
was 
successful 
as 
a 
businessman 
and 
as 
a 
chemist, 
but 
who 
believed 
that 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
make 
all 
people 
happy 
by 
establishing 
comptabilisme 
social 
[compatibilism]. 
In 
Canada, 
there 
was 
the 
Alberta 
Experiment, 
the 
program 
of 
an 
Englishman, 
Major 
Clifford 
H. 
Douglas 
[1879–1952]. 
Douglas 
called 
it 
“social 
credit.” 


How 
could 
people 
be 
so 
mistaken 
as 
to 
assume 
that 
there 
were 
no 
consequences 
from 
this 
credit 
expansion? 
A 
special 
doctrine 
was 
developed 
for 
this 
purpose. 
It 
was 
said 
that 
within 
the 
economic 
system 
there 
is 
a 
natural 
limit 
to 
credit 
expansion. 
The 
amount 
of 
money 
required 
for 
business 
transactions, 
they 
said, 
was 
determined 
by 
the 
“needs 
of 
business,” 
and 
if 
the 
banks 
did 
not 
expand 
credit 
more 
than 
called 
for 
by 
these 
“needs 
of 
business,” 
then 
no 
harm 
can 
be 
done. 
Their 
idea 
was 
this: 
The 
producer 
of 
raw 
materials 
sells 
raw 
materials 
to 
a 
manufacturer 
and 
issues 
a 
bill 
of 



exchange 
to 
him; 
the 
businessman 
who 
buys 
the 
raw 
materials 
takes 
the 
bill 
of 
exchange 
to 
the 
bank; 
the 
bank 
discounts 
it 
and 
gives 
him 
credit 
to 
pay 
for 
these 
raw 
materials; 
after 
three 
months 
the 
manufacturer 
has 
produced 
a 
finished 
product 
out 
of 
these 
raw 
materials; 
he 
sells 
the 
product 
and 
pays 
back 
the 
loan 
granted 
to 
him. 
Therefore, 
the 
proponents 
of 
this 
system 
say, 
there 
is 
no 
danger 
if 
the 
bank 
merely 
provides 
credit 
enabling 
the 
businessman 
to 
buy 
these 
raw 
materials. 
If 
the 
bank 
limits 
itself 
to 
granting 
credit 
to 
such 
business 
already 
transacted, 
they 
say, 
then 
the 
amount 
of 
credit 
asked 
from 
the 
bank 
for 
such 
purposes 
is 
limited 
by 
the 
“needs 
of 
business”—by 
the 
exact 
and 
real 
amount 
of 
business 
transacted 
in 
the 
country. 
Therefore, 
it 
doesn’t 
mean 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
supply 
of 
credit, 
because 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
supply 
of 
credit 
corresponds 
exactly 
to 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
demand 
for 
credit 
transactions 
based 
on 
real 
transactions 
on 
the 
part 
of 
business. 


But 
what 
this 
doctrine 
did 
not 
see 
was 
that 
these 
“needs 
of 
business” 
depend 
on 
the 
amount 
of 
credit 
given 
by 
the 
bank. 
And 
the 
amount 
of 
credit 
it 
gives 
out 
depends 
on 
the 
interest 
rate 
it 
asks 
from 
borrowers. 
The 
higher 
the 
interest 
rate, 
the 
fewer 
borrowers 
will 
want 
loans; 
the 
lower 
the 
interest 
rate, 
the 
more 
borrowers 
will 
ask 
for 
credit. 


Every 
businessman 
calculates 
the 
expected 
outgo 
and 
income 
of 
his 
projects. 
If 
his 
calculations 
show 
that 
the 
transaction, 
given 
the 
costs, 
including, 
of 
course, 
the 
cost 
of 
interest, 
will 
not 
pay, 
then 
the 
project 
is 
not 
undertaken. 
But 
if 
the 
bank 
of 
issue 
appears 
on 
the 
scene 
and 
creates 
additional 
circulation 
credit 
to 
give 
out 
for 
such 
purposes, 
thereby 
lowering 
the 
rate 
of 
interest 
below 
what 
it 
would 
have 
been 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
this 
new 
credit, 
even 
if 
only 
by 
a 
quarter 
or 
a 
fifth 
of 
one 
percent, 
a 
number 
of 
projects 
which 
would 
not 
have 
been 
undertaken 
at 
the 
higher 
rate 
of 
interest 
would 
now 
be 
done. 
The 
credit 
expansion 
of 
the 
bank 
creates 
its 
own 
demand; 
it 
gives 
the 
impression 
that 
more 
savings, 
more 
capital 
goods, 
are 
available 
than 
actually 
is 
the 
case. 
In 
fact 
what 
has 
been 
increased 
is 
only 
the 
amount 
of 
credit. 


If 
the 
bank 
does 
not 
expand 
credit, 
if 
it 
does 
not 
give 
out 
new 
circulation 
credit 
for 
this 
purpose, 
that 
is, 
if 
it 
lends 
only 
money 
from 
someone’s 
savings, 
the 
consequence 
would 
be 
that 
the 
bank 
would 
have 
to 
charge 
a 
higher 
rate 
of 
interest 
than 
if 
it 
did 
create 
new 
credit. 
Then 
many 
transactions 
would 
not 
be 
conducted, 
precisely 
on 
account 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
rate 
of 
interest 
was 
a 
little 
bit 
higher. 
However, 
if 
the 
bank 
gives 
out 
new 
credit, 



additional 
money, 
it 
must 
reduce 
the 
interest 
rate 
to 
attract 
new 
borrowers, 
as 
all 
available 
funds 
were 
already 
loaned 
out 
at 
the 
prevailing 
market 
rate 
of 
interest. 


The 
banks 
very 
often 
expand 
credit 
for 
political 
reasons. 
There 
is 
an 
old 
saying 
that 
if 
prices 
are 
rising, 
if 
business 
is 
booming, 
the 
party 
in 
power 
has 
a 
better 
chance 
to 
succeed 
in 
an 
election 
campaign 
than 
it 
would 
otherwise. 
Thus 
the 
decision 
to 
expand 
credit 
is 
very 
often 
influenced 
by 
the 
government 
that 
wants 
to 
have 
“prosperity.” 
Therefore, 
governments 
all 
over 
the 
world 
are 
in 
favor 
of 
such 
a 
credit-expansion 
policy. 


On 
the 
market, 
credit 
expansion 
creates 
the 
impression 
that 
more 
capital 
and 
savings 
are 
available 
than 
actually 
are, 
and 
that 
projects 
which 
yesterday 
were 
not 
practical 
because 
of 
the 
higher 
interest 
rate 
are 
feasible 
today 
because 
conditions 
have 
changed. 
Businessmen 
assume 
that 
the 
lower 
interest 
rate 
signals 
the 
availability 
of 
sufficient 
capital 
goods. 
This 
means 
that 
credit 
expansion 
falsifies 
the 
businessman’s 
economic 
calculations; 
it 
gives 
the 
impression 
to 
him, 
to 
the 
nation, 
and 
to 
the 
world, 
that 
there 
are 
more 
capital 
goods 
than 
there 
really 
are. 
By 
credit 
expansion, 
you 
can 
increase 
the 
accounting 
concept 
of 
“capital”; 
what 
you 
cannot 
do 
is 
create 
more 
real 
capital 
goods. 
As 
production 
is 
necessarily 
always 
limited 
by 
the 
amount 
of 
capital 
goods 
available, 
the 
result 
of 
credit 
expansion 
is 
to 
make 
businessmen 
believe 
that 
projects 
are 
feasible 
which 
actually 
cannot 
be 
executed 
on 
account 
of 
the 
existing 
scarcity 
of 
capital 
goods. 
Thus 
credit 
expansion 
misleads 
businessmen, 
results 
in 
distorting 
production 
and 
causes 
economic 
“malinvestment.” 
When 
the 
credit 
expansion 
causes 
businessmen 
to 
undertake 
such 
projects, 
the 
result 
is 
called 
a 
“boom.” 


We 
must 
not 
overlook 
the 
fact 
that 
all 
during 
the 
nineteenth 
and 
twentieth 
centuries 
there 
was 
always 
an 
obsession, 
unfortunately 
not 
against 
credit 
expansion, 
but 
at 
least 
against 
giving 
the 
government 
too 
much 
power 
in 
matters 
of 
credit 
expansion. 
The 
main 
object 
was 
to 
limit 
the 
government’s 
influence 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
central 
banks. 


In 
the 
course 
of 
history, 
governments 
have 
used 
the 
central 
banks 
again 
and 
again 
for 
borrowing 
money. 
The 
government 
can 
borrow 
money 
from 
the 
public. 
For 
instance, 
a 
person 
who 
has 
saved 
one 
hundred 
dollars 
could 
hold 
them 
as 
dollars 
or 
invest 
them. 
But 
instead 
of 
doing 
either 
of 
these 
things 
he 
can 
buy 
a 
new 
government 
bond; 
this 
purchase 
doesn’t 
change 
the 
amount 
of 
money 
in 
existence; 
the 
money 
he 
pays 
for 
the 
bond 
passes 
from 
his 
hands 
to 
those 
of 
the 
government. 
But 
if 
the 
government 
goes 
to 
the 
central 
bank 
to 



borrow 
the 
money, 
the 
bank 
can 
buy 
government 
bonds 
and 
lend 
money 
to 
the 
government 
simply 
by 
expanding 
credit, 
in 
effect 
creating 
new 
money. 
Governments 
have 
a 
lot 
of 
good 
ideas 
as 
to 
how 
to 
carry 
out 
this 
borrowing. 


There 
has 
always 
been 
a 
struggle 
between 
parliaments 
and 
the 
executive 
concerning 
the 
government’s 
influence 
on 
the 
central 
banks. 
Most 
of 
the 
European 
legislatures 
said 
very 
clearly 
that 
their 
central 
banks 
must 
be 
separate 
from 
the 
government, 
that 
they 
must 
be 
independent. 
And 
in 
this 
country, 
you 
know 
there 
is 
a 
continual 
conflict 
between 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Board 
and 
the 
U.S. 
Treasury. 
This 
is 
a 
natural 
situation 
caused 
by 
economic 
laws 
and 
government 
legislation. 
Some 
governments 
have 
found 
it 
very 
easy 
to 
violate 
the 
legislation 
without 
violating 
the 
letter 
of 
the 
law. 
The 
German 
government, 
for 
instance, 
borrowed 
from 
the 
public 
during 
World 
War 
I 
because 
the 
Reichsbank 
had 
promised 
to 
give 
it 
loans. 
Private 
individuals 
who 
bought 
German 
government 
bonds 
needed 
to 
pay 
out 
only 
17 
percent 
of 
the 
amount 
of 
the 
bond, 
and 
this 
17 
percent 
gave 
them 
a 
yield 
of 
6 
or 
7 
percent. 
Hence, 
83 
percent 
of 
the 
price 
of 
the 
bond 
was 
supplied 
by 
the 
Bank. 
This 
meant 
that 
when 
the 
government 
borrowed 
from 
the 
public, 
it 
was 
actually 
borrowing 
indirectly 
from 
the 
German 
Reichsbank. 
The 
result 
was 
that 
in 
Germany 
the 
U. 
S. 
dollar 
went 
from 
4.20 
Marks 
pre-World 
War 
I, 
to 


4.2 
billion 
Marks 
by 
the 
end 
of 
1923.2 
There 
has 
always 
been 
resistance 
to 
giving 
power 
to 
the 
central 
banks, 
but 
in 
the 
last 
decades 
this 
resistance 
has 
been 
by 
and 
large 
completely 
defeated 
in 
all 
countries 
of 
the 
world. 
The 
U. 
S. 
government 
has 
used 
the 
power 
of 
the 
central 
bank, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve, 
to 
borrow 
from 
it 
to 
obtain 
a 
considerable 
part 
of 
the 
money 
it 
needs 
to 
fund 
its 
expenditures. 
The 
consequences 
have 
been 
inflation 
and 
a 
tendency 
for 
prices 
and 
wage 
rates 
to 
rise. 


There 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
the 
credit 
expansion 
brings 
about 
a 
drop 
in 
the 
rate 
of 
interest. 
Why 
then 
does 
this 
not 
mean 
that 
the 
rate 
of 
interest 
can 
always 
remain 
low 
and 
that 
interest 
could 
really 
disappear 
completely? 
If 
it 
is 
true 
that 
the 
rate 
of 
interest 
is 
not 
a 
monetary 
phenomenon 
but 
a 
general 
phenomenon 
of 
the 
market, 
which 
reflects 
the 
fact 
that 
future 
goods 
are 
traded 
at 
a 
discount 
as 
compared 
with 
present 
goods, 
we 
must 
ask 
ourselves, 
“What 
is 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
process 
which, 
after 
the 
initial 
drop 
of 
the 
interest 
rate 
due 
to 
credit 
expansion, 
finally 
brings 
about 
step 
by 
step 
a 
return 
of 
the 
rate 
of 
interest 
to 
that 
level 
which 
reflects 
market 
conditions 
and 
the 
general 
state 
of 
affairs?” 
That 
is, 
if 
the 
rate 
of 
interest 
is 
a 
general 
category 
of 
human 



action, 
and 
yet 
if 
an 
increased 
supply 
of 
money 
and 
bank 
credit 
can 
bring 
about 
a 
temporary 
drop 
in 
the 
rate 
of 
interest, 
how 
does 
the 
interest 
rate 
return 
once 
more 
to 
the 
rate 
that 
reflects 
the 
discount 
of 
future 
goods 
over 
present 
goods? 


In 
answering 
this 
question, 
we 
are 
also 
answering 
a 
question 
that 
has 
occupied 
people 
for 
decades, 
even 
centuries 
in 
some 
countries 
that 
have 
had 
central 
banks 
and 
a 
system 
of 
credit 
expansion. 
This 
is 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
trade 
cycle—the 
regular 
return 
of 
periods 
of 
economic 
depression. 
In 
Great 
Britain 
from 
the 
end 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
century 
on, 
and 
later 
in 
those 
countries 
of 
the 
world 
that 
entered 
step 
by 
step 
into 
the 
system 
of 
modern 
capitalism 
and 
modern 
banking 
methods, 
we 
could 
observe 
from 
time 
to 
time 
an 
almost 
regular 
occurrence 
of 
events, 
i.e., 
the 
emergence 
of 
periods 
of 
economic 
depression, 
economic 
crises. 
We 
do 
not 
mean 
economic 
crises 
brought 
about 
by 
some 
obvious 
event 
that 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
explain 
the 
emergence 
of 
this 
crisis. 
For 
instance, 
in 
the 
early 
1860s 
the 
American 
Civil 
War 
made 
it 
impossible 
to 
ship 
cotton 
from 
the 
United 
States 
to 
Europe; 
and 
the 
U. 
S. 
Southern 
states 
were 
at 
that 
time 
the 
only 
suppliers 
of 
cotton 
to 
Europe. 
There 
was 
a 
very 
bad 
economic 
crisis, 
starting 
in 
the 
cotton-goods 
industries 
in 
Europe 
and 
as 
a 
consequence 
other 
industries 
suffered 
also. 
But 
everyone 
realized 
what 
was 
causing 
this 
crisis—it 
was 
the 
American 
Civil 
War 
and 
the 
stoppage 
of 
shipments 
of 
cotton 
to 
Europe. 
We 
do 
not 
deal 
with 
such 
crises 
due 
to 
a 
definite 
identifiable 
situation. 
We 
deal 
with 
a 
genuine 
crisis 
in 
all 
branches 
of 
business—although 
it 
is 
sometimes 
worse 
in 
some 
branches 
than 
in 
others—a 
crisis 
for 
which 
people 
couldn’t 
see 
any 
special 
reason. 


From 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
on, 
people 
began 
to 
consider 
these 
periodic 
crises 
as 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
problems 
of 
economic 
research. 
In 
the 
1830s 
and 
1840s 
British 
economists 
answered 
this 
question 
by 
saying, 
“What 
we 
have 
to 
study 
is 
not 
the 
economic 
depression. 
This 
depression 
is 
always 
the 
consequence 
of 
a 
preceding 
boom. 
We 
must 
ask 
ourselves 
not 
‘What 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
crisis?’—we 
must 
ask 
‘What 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
preceding 
boom?’ 
And 
we 
must 
ask 
ourselves 
what 
is 
the 
reason 
why 
the 
unquestionable 
and 
certain 
development 
of 
economic 
conditions 
that 
takes 
place 
in 
all 
countries 
with 
capitalism 
does 
not 
proceed 
steadily 
upward, 
but 
follows 
a 
wave-like 
movement, 
a 
movement 
in 
which 
there 
are 
repeated 
boom 
periods 
that 
always 
are 
followed 
by 
periods 
of 
depression.” 
In 
this 
way 
the 
crisis 
problem 
was 
transformed 
into 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
trade 
cycle. 
And 
for 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
trade 
cycle 
many 
more 
or 
less 



wrong 
explanations 
were 
offered. 


I 
want 
to 
mention 
only 
one. 
This 
was 
the 
doctrine 
of 
an 
otherwise 
famous 
economist, 
William 
Stanley 
Jevons 
[1835–1882]. 
His 
doctrine 
acquired 
some 
fame. 
He 
attributed 
economic 
crises 
to 
sunspots. 
He 
said 
that 
sunspots 
bring 
about 
bad 
harvests, 
and 
this 
means 
bad 
business. 
If 
this 
was 
so, 
why 
then 
didn’t 
business 
adjust 
to 
this 
natural 
phenomenon 
as 
it 
learned 
to 
adjust 
to 
other 
natural 
phenomena? 


If 
there 
is 
credit 
expansion, 
it 
must 
necessarily 
lower 
the 
rate 
of 
interest. 
If 
the 
banks 
are 
to 
find 
borrowers 
for 
additional 
credit, 
they 
must 
lower 
the 
rate 
of 
interest 
or 
lower 
the 
credit 
qualifications 
of 
would-be 
borrowers. 
Because 
all 
those 
who 
wanted 
loans 
at 
the 
previous 
rate 
of 
interest 
had 
gotten 
them, 
the 
banks 
must 
either 
offer 
loans 
at 
a 
lower 
interest 
rate 
or 
include 
in 
the 
class 
of 
businesses 
to 
whom 
loans 
are 
granted 
at 
the 
previous 
rate 
less-
promising 
businesses, 
people 
of 
lower 
credit 
quality. 


When 
individuals 
consume 
less 
than 
they 
produce, 
the 
surplus 
production 
is 
set 
aside 
as 
savings. 
Thus 
when 
the 
money 
given 
out 
in 
loans 
comes 
from 
savers, 
it 
represents 
actual 
goods 
which 
are 
available 
for 
further 
production. 
But 
when 
the 
loans 
are 
granted 
out 
of 
credit 
expansion, 
businessmen 
are 
misled; 
there 
are 
no 
goods 
standing 
behind 
them, 
only 
newly 
created 
credit. 
This 
leads 
to 
a 
falsification 
of 
economic 
calculation. 
Credit 
expansion 
brings 
about 
a 
systematic 
falsification—it 
gives 
to 
the 
individual 
businessman 
the 
impression 
that 
a 
project 
that 
couldn’t 
be 
executed 
yesterday 
because 
there 
were 
not 
enough 
capital 
goods, 
can 
now 
be 
executed 
on 
account 
of 
the 
credit 
expansion. 
As 
a 
result, 
there 
is 
an 
intensification 
of 
business 
activity, 
which 
means 
that 
higher 
prices 
are 
offered 
for 
the 
factors 
of 
production. 
But 
there 
has 
been 
no 
increase 
in 
the 
quantity 
of 
capital 
goods. 
Therefore 
the 
intensification 
of 
business 
activity 
means 
an 
artificial 
boom. 
Producers 
of 
factors 
of 
production 
are 
happy 
when 
they 
see 
that 
the 
prices 
they 
are 
getting 
are 
higher 
than 
they 
were 
yesterday. 
But 
this 
cannot 
go 
on 
forever, 
because 
no 
more 
material 
factors 
of 
production 
have 
been 
produced. 
The 
prices 
of 
these 
factors 
of 
production 
are 
going 
up 
more 
and 
more 
as 
borrowers 
of 
the 
new 
credit 
compete 
and 
bid 
up 
their 
prices. 
Then 
finally 
two 
alternatives 
are 
possible. 


Business 
is 
asking 
for 
more 
and 
more 
credit. 
Either 
(1) 
the 
banks 
grant 
this 
demand 
by 
creating 
more 
and 
more 
credit 
(this 
happened 
in 
Germany 
in 
1923, 
when 
it 
led 
to 
a 
complete 
breakdown 
of 
the 
currency). 
Or 
(2) 
one 
day, 
because 
they 
realize 
for 
some 
reason 
or 
other 
that 
they 
must 
stop 
credit 



expansion, 
the 
banks 
do 
stop 
creating 
new 
credit 
to 
lend. 
Then 
the 
firms 
that 
have 
expanded 
cannot 
get 
credit 
to 
pay 
for 
the 
factors 
of 
production 
necessary 
for 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
investment 
projects 
which 
they 
have 
already 
committed 
themselves. 
Because 
they 
cannot 
pay 
their 
bills, 
they 
sell 
off 
their 
inventories 
cheap. 
Then 
comes 
the 
panic, 
the 
breakdown. 
And 
the 
depression 
starts. 


On 
account 
of 
the 
credit 
expansion 
the 
whole 
economic 
system 
of 
the 
country 
or 
of 
the 
world 
is 
in 
the 
situation 
of 
a 
man 
who 
has 
a 
limited 
supply 
of 
building 
materials 
available 
and 
wants 
to 
construct 
a 
home. 
But 
being 
poor 
in 
technological 
calculations, 
he 
makes 
some 
mistakes. 
He 
thinks 
he 
can 
build 
a 
bigger 
house 
out 
of 
his 
limited 
supply 
of 
building 
materials 
than 
he 
really 
can. 
Therefore, 
he 
starts 
by 
constructing 
too 
large 
a 
foundation. 
Only 
later 
does 
he 
discover 
that 
he 
has 
made 
a 
mistake 
and 
that 
he 
cannot 
finish 
the 
house 
in 
the 
way 
he 
had 
intended. 
Then 
he 
must 
either 
abandon 
the 
whole 
project, 
or 
use 
the 
materials 
still 
available 
to 
build 
a 
smaller 
house, 
leaving 
part 
of 
the 
foundation 
unused. 
This 
is 
the 
situation 
in 
which 
a 
country 
or 
in 
which 
the 
world 
finds 
itself 
at 
the 
end 
of 
a 
crisis 
caused 
by 
credit 
expansion. 
Because 
of 
the 
easy 
credit 
businessmen 
make 
mistakes 
in 
their 
economic 
calculations 
and 
find 
themselves 
with 
over-ambitious 
plans 
which 
cannot 
be 
completed 
because 
of 
insufficient 
factors 
of 
production. 


In 
every 
boom 
period 
that 
precedes 
a 
crisis, 
in 
Great 
Britain 
and 
then 
later 
in 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
world, 
indeed, 
in 
every 
country 
in 
the 
world 
which 
has 
experienced 
credit 
expansion, 
you 
always 
find 
people 
who 
have 
said, 
“This 
is 
not 
a 
boom 
that 
will 
be 
followed 
by 
a 
crisis; 
only 
people 
who 
do 
not 
know 
what 
is 
going 
on 
can 
say 
such 
a 
thing. 
This 
is 
the 
final 
prosperity—an 
everlasting 
prosperity. 
We 
will 
never 
again 
have 
such 
a 
crisis.” 
The 
more 
people 
believe 
in 
this 
slogan 
of 
everlasting 
prosperity, 
the 
more 
desperate 
they 
become 
when 
they 
discover 
that 
the 
“everlasting” 
prosperity 
doesn’t 
last 
forever. 


One 
thing 
that 
made 
matters 
worse 
following 
1929, 
than 
in 
preceding 
periods 
of 
depression, 
was 
that 
the 
American 
unions 
were 
really 
very 
powerful 
and 
they 
would 
not 
tolerate 
that 
the 
crisis 
should 
bring 
about 
those 
results 
which 
were 
the 
consequence 
of 
earlier 
crises 
in 
this 
country 
and 
in 
other 
countries—i.e., 
they 
would 
not 
tolerate 
a 
considerable 
drop 
in 
money 
wage 
rates. 
In 
some 
branches 
of 
business, 
money 
wages 
went 
a 
little 
bit 
down. 
But 
by 
and 
large 
the 
unions 
were 
successful 
in 
maintaining 
the 
wage 
rates 
which 
had 
been 
developed 
artificially 
during 
the 
boom. 
Therefore, 
the 



number 
of 
unemployed 
remained 
considerable, 
and 
unemployment 
continued 
for 
a 
very 
long 
time. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
those 
workers 
who 
did 
not 
lose 
their 
jobs 
enjoyed 
a 
situation 
in 
which 
their 
wages 
did 
not 
drop 
to 
the 
same 
extent 
as 
commodity 
prices. 
The 
living 
conditions 
of 
some 
groups 
of 
labor 
even 
improved.3 


This 
was 
the 
same 
situation 
that 
led 
to 
the 
conditions 
in 
England 
in 
the 
latter 
part 
of 
the 
1920s, 
which 
were 
important 
in 
bringing 
about 
the 
doctrines 
of 
Lord 
Keynes 
and 
the 
ideas 
of 
credit 
expansion 
that 
have 
been 
practiced 
in 
recent 
years. 
The 
British 
government 
made 
a 
very 
serious 
mistake 
in 
the 
1920s. 
It 
was 
necessary 
for 
Great 
Britain 
to 
stabilize 
the 
currency. 
But 
they 
did 
not 
simply 
stabilize. 
In 
1925, 
they 
returned 
to 
the 
pre-war 
gold 
value 
of 
the 
pound. 
That 
meant 
that 
the 
pound 
was 
a 
heavier 
pound 
afterwards 
and 
had 
a 
greater 
purchasing 
power 
than 
the 
pound, 
of 
let 
us 
say, 
1920. 
A 
country 
like 
Great 
Britain 
that 
imports 
raw 
materials 
and 
foodstuffs 
and 
exports 
manufactures 
should 
not 
have 
made 
the 
pound 
more 
expensive. 
As 
Hitler 
expressed 
it, 
“They 
must 
either 
export 
or 
starve.” 
In 
such 
a 
country, 
in 
which 
the 
unions 
did 
not 
tolerate 
a 
drop 
in 
wage 
rates, 
it 
meant 
that 
the 
costs 
in 
pounds 
of 
manufacturing 
British 
products 
were 
increased 
in 
relation 
to 
production 
costs 
in 
countries 
which 
had 
not 
made 
a 
similar 
return 
to 
the 
gold 
standard. 
With 
higher 
costs, 
you 
must 
ask 
higher 
prices 
to 
stay 
in 
business. 
So 
you 
can 
sell 
fewer 
units 
and 
must 
cut 
production. 
Therefore, 
unemployment 
increased, 
and 
there 
was 
permanent 
mass 
unemployment. 


Because 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
unions 
concerning 
this 
problem, 
the 
government 
proceeded 
in 
1931 
to 
devalue 
the 
pound 
much 
more 
than 
it 
had 
been 
revalued 
in 
1925, 
in 
order, 
they 
said, 
to 
encourage 
export 
trade. 
Other 
countries 
did 
the 
same. 
Czechoslovakia 
did 
it 
twice. 
The 
United 
States 
followed 
in 
1933. 
The 
countries 
of 
the 
French 
standard 
(France, 
Switzerland) 
followed 
in 
1936. 
I 
mention 
this 
because 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
realize 
why 
the 
crisis 
of 
1929—it 
was 
merely 
a 
crisis 
of 
credit 
expansion— 
had 
much 
longer 
and 
more 
serious 
consequences 
than 
those 
crises 
in 
preceding 
times. 
Of 
course, 
the 
Marxians 
say, 
every 
crisis 
must 
be 
worse 
and 
worse; 
the 
Russians, 
they 
say, 
have 
no 
trade 
cycle. 
Of 
course 
the 
Russians 
don’t; 
they 
have 
a 
depression 
all 
the 
time. 


We 
must 
realize 
the 
tremendous 
“psychological” 
importance, 
the 
enormous 
importance 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
and 
twentieth 
centuries, 
credit 
expansion 
was 
limited. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
was 
the 
general 
opinion 
of 
businessmen, 
economists, 
statesmen, 
and 
the 
people, 
that 



bank 
credit 
expansion 
was 
necessary, 
that 
the 
rate 
of 
interest 
was 
an 
obstacle 
to 
prosperity, 
and 
that 
an 
“easy 
money” 
policy 
was 
a 
good 
policy 
to 
have. 
Everyone, 
businessmen 
as 
well 
as 
economists, 
considered 
credit 
expansion 
necessary 
and 
they 
became 
very 
angry 
if 
somebody 
tried 
to 
say 
that 
it 
might 
have 
some 
drawbacks. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
it 
was 
considered 
practically 
indecent 
to 
support 
the 
British 
Currency 
School, 
which 
was 
opposed 
to 
credit 
expansion. 


When 
I 
started 
to 
study 
the 
theory 
of 
money 
and 
credit 
I 
found 
in 
the 
whole 
world 
of 
literature 
only 
one 
living 
author, 
a 
Swedish 
economist, 
Knut 
Wicksell 
[1851–1926], 
who 
really 
saw 
the 
problems 
in 
credit 
expansion.4 
The 
idea 
prevails 
even 
today 
that 
we 
cannot 
do 
without 
credit 
expansion. 
It 
will 
be 
impossible, 
without 
a 
very 
serious 
struggle 
which 
really 
has 
to 
be 
fought, 
to 
defeat 
all 
those 
ideological 
forces 
that 
are 
operating 
in 
favor 
of 
credit 
expansion. 
Most 
people, 
of 
course, 
don’t 
give 
any 
thought 
to 
credit 
expansion. 
But 
the 
governments 
have 
a 
very 
clear 
idea 
about 
it—they 
say, 
“We 
can’t 
do 
without 
it.” 


Credit 
expansion 
is 
fundamentally 
really 
a 
problem 
of 
civil 
rights. 
Representative 
government 
is 
based 
on 
the 
principle 
that 
the 
citizens 
need 
to 
pay 
to 
the 
government 
only 
those 
taxes 
that 
have 
been 
legally 
promulgated 
in 
a 
constitutional 
way: 
“No 
taxation 
without 
representation.” 
However, 
governments 
believe 
they 
cannot 
ask 
their 
citizens 
to 
pay 
as 
much 
in 
taxes 
as 
is 
needed 
to 
cover 
the 
whole 
of 
government 
expenditures. 
When 
governments 
cannot 
cover 
their 
expenses 
out 
of 
legally 
enacted 
taxes, 
they 
borrow 
from 
the 
commercial 
banks 
and 
so 
expand 
credit. 
Therefore, 
representative 
government 
can 
actually 
be 
the 
instigator 
of 
credit 
expansion 
and 
inflation. 


If 
the 
institution 
of 
credit 
expansion 
and 
other 
types 
of 
government 
inflation 
had 
been 
invented 
in 
the 
seventeenth 
century 
the 
history 
of 
the 
struggle 
of 
the 
Stuarts 
with 
the 
British 
Parliament 
would 
have 
been 
very 
different. 
Charles 
I 
[1600–1649] 
wouldn’t 
have 
had 
any 
problems 
in 
getting 
the 
money 
he 
needed 
if 
he 
could 
simply 
have 
ordered 
the 
Bank 
of 
England, 
which 
didn’t 
exist 
in 
his 
time, 
to 
grant 
him 
credit. 
He 
would 
then 
have 
been 
in 
a 
position 
to 
organize 
an 
army 
of 
the 
King 
and 
to 
defeat 
Parliament. 
This 
is 
only 
one 
aspect. 


The 
second 
aspect—I 
don’t 
believe 
that 
this 
country 
could 
stand 
psychologically 
a 
recurrence 
of 
a 
crisis 
like 
that 
of 
1929. 
And 
the 
only 
way 
to 
avoid 
such 
a 
crisis 
is 
by 
preventing 
the 
boom. 
We 
are 
already 
very 
far 
along 
in 
this 
boom, 
but 
we 
could 
still 
stop 
it 
in 
time. 
However, 
there 
is 
a 
great 



danger. 
While 
capital 
goods 
are 
limited 
in 
amount 
and 
are 
scarce 
and 
would, 
therefore, 
limit 
those 
projects 
which 
can 
be 
executed 
and 
make 
many 
projects 
appear 
impossible 
for 
the 
time 
being, 
credit 
expansion 
can 
hide 
by 
the 
illusion 
of 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
capital 
reported 
in 
dollars 
on 
the 
books. 
Credit 
expansion 
creates 
the 
illusion 
of 
available 
capital, 
while 
in 
fact 
there 
is 
not. 


The 
fundamental 
problem 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
was 
that 
people 
didn’t 
realize 
these 
things. 
As 
a 
result, 
capitalism 
was 
very 
much 
discredited, 
for 
people 
believed 
that 
the 
almost 
periodic 
occurrence 
of 
depressions 
was 
a 
phenomenon 
of 
capitalism. 
Marx 
and 
his 
followers 
expected 
the 
depressions 
to 
get 
progressively 
worse, 
and 
Stalin 
still 
says 
openly 
every 
day: 
“We 
have 
only 
to 
wait. 
There 
will 
be 
a 
very 
bad 
crisis 
in 
the 
capitalist 
countries.” 
If 
we 
want 
to 
thwart 
these 
plans 
we 
must 
realize 
that 
sound 
credit 
policies 
acknowledge 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
is 
a 
scarcity 
of 
capital 
goods, 
that 
capital 
cannot 
simply 
be 
increased 
by 
credit 
expansion. 
This 
must 
come 
to 
be 
recognized 
by 
our 
businessmen 
and 
politicians.

[Additional 
comments 
by 
Mises 
during 
the 
question-and-answer 
period.] 


What 
happened 
in 
the 
past 
with 
credit 
expansion 
has 
been, 
by 
and 
large, 
absorbed 
and 
adjusted 
to 
by 
the 
market. 
I 
would 
say, 
take 
as 
“given” 
the 
conditions 
as 
they 
have 
happened 
in 
the 
past, 
and 
say 
only 
that 
for 
the 
future 
there 
should 
be 
no 
more 
credit 
expansion. 
In 
the 
future 
no 
additional 
banknotes 
should 
be 
issued, 
no 
additional 
credit 
should 
be 
entered 
on 
a 
bank 
account 
subject 
to 
check, 
unless 
there 
is 
100 
percent 
coverage 
in 
money. 
This 
is 
the 
100-percent 
plan. 
With 
respect 
to 
today’s 
situation, 
we 
should 
leave 
everything 
that 
has 
happened 
in 
the 
past 
alone—we 
should 
not 
attempt 
to 
reverse 
it 
because 
that 
would 
be 
deflationary. 
Deflation 
is 
not 
as 
dangerous, 
not 
as 
bad, 
as 
inflation. 
Deflation 
is 
expensive 
for 
the 
government, 
while 
inflation 
is 
profitable 
for 
the 
government. 
But 
deflation, 
too, 
must 
be 
avoided. 


If 
there 
hadn’t 
been 
any 
privileged 
banks 
and 
if 
government 
had 
not 
forced 
citizens 
to 
take 
the 
banknotes 
by 
making 
them 
“legal 
tender,” 
banknotes 
would 
never 
have 
become 
popular. 
The 
average 
citizen 
today 
in 
every 
country 
of 
the 
world, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
most 
backward 
countries, 
considers 
as 
money 
every 
scrap 
of 
paper 
upon 
which 
the 
government 
or 
an 
institution 
privileged 
by 
the 
government 
has 
printed 
the 



magic 
words 
“legal 
tender.” 
But 
it 
was 
different 
in 
the 
past. 
It 
was 
not 
easy 
to 
make 
people 
accept 
banknotes. 
They 
took 
them 
because 
the 
banknotes 
were 
better 
than 
nothing. 
If 
a 
person 
didn’t 
want 
the 
banknotes 
he 
could 
take 
them 
back 
to 
the 
bank 
that 
issued 
them; 
and 
if 
the 
bank 
couldn’t 
redeem 
them 
the 
bank 
went 
broke. 
The 
“wonderful” 
thing 
about 
government-issued 
banknotes, 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
government 
and 
the 
banks, 
is 
that 
the 
bank 
is 
not 
required 
to 
redeem 
them, 
except 
perhaps 
in 
legal 
tender 
money, 
which 
is 
again 
banknotes. 


If 
the 
governments 
had 
never 
interfered 
with 
money 
and 
banking, 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
leave 
every 
citizen 
free 
to 
issue 
his 
own 
banknotes. 
I 
want 
to 
give 
everybody 
the 
right 
to 
issue 
his 
own 
banknotes. 
The 
problem 
then 
would 
be 
to 
get 
other 
men 
to 
accept 
such 
private 
banknotes; 
maybe 
nobody 
will 
take 
them. 
I 
am 
not 
against 
banknotes 
as 
such; 
I 
am 
only 
against 
banknotes 
that 
are 
protected 
by 
some 
government 
privilege. 
I 
want 
the 
banknotes 
issued 
in 
the 
past 
to 
retain 
their 
privilege, 
but 
no 
more 
legal 
tender 
banknotes 
and 
no 
more 
credit 
expansion! 


If 
I 
say 
that 
the 
return 
to 
the 
gold 
standard 
is 
necessary 
it 
is 
because 
it 
makes 
inflation 
impossible. 
Under 
the 
gold 
standard 
the 
amount 
of 
money 
depends 
on 
geological 
factors 
that 
cannot 
be 
controlled 
by 
the 
government. 
It 
is 
not 
an 
unreasonable 
standard 
because 
it 
is 
the 
only 
alternative 
to 
making 
money 
completely 
dependent 
on 
the 
government. 
If 
King 
Charles 
I 
[1600– 
1649] 
had 
had 
the 
power 
to 
print 
paper 
money 
he 
would 
probably 
have 
been 
in 
a 
much 
better 
position 
in 
his 
fight 
against 
the 
government. 


Under 
the 
gold 
standard, 
the 
supply 
of 
money 
is 
independent 
of 
the 
changing 
whims 
and 
political 
programs 
of 
governments 
and 
political 
parties. 
For 
centuries 
there 
were 
struggles 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
predecessors 
of 
our 
parliamentary 
bodies 
against 
the 
princes 
who 
wanted 
to 
debase 
the 
currency. 
The 
princes 
said, 
“What 
counts 
is 
only 
the 
name 
which 
I 
give 
to 
money.” 
But 
their 
silver 
money 
got 
a 
“red 
face” 
when 
the 
princes 
adulterated 
it 
with 
copper, 
all 
the 
while 
declaring 
that 
their 
new 
alloyed 
money, 
which 
contained 
less 
silver 
than 
the 
old 
money, 
still 
had 
the 
same 
purchasing 
power 
and 
the 
same 
legal 
tender 
power 
as 
the 
old 
money. 
If 
the 
government 
is 
in 
a 
position 
to 
provide 
for 
some 
of 
its 
expenditures 
by 
creating 
money, 
it 
no 
longer 
needs 
to 
depend, 
let 
us 
say, 
on 
Congress. 
Historically 
and 
politically 
the 
gold 
standard 
is 
an 
implement 
in 
the 
system 
of 
legislation 
that 
limits 
the 
power 
of 
government 
and 
makes 
government 
dependent 
on 
the 
will 
of 
the 
people.

8TH 
LECTURE 



Profit 
and 
Loss, 
Private 
Property, 
and 
the 
Achievements 
of 
Capitalism 


IN 
DEALING 
WITH 
ALL 
MATTERS 
CONCERNING 
CAPITALISM, 
it 
is 
fundamental 
never 
to 
forget 
the 
difference 
between 
“capital 
goods” 
and 
“capital.” 
“Capital 
goods” 
are 
physical 
things. 
The 
concept 
of 
“capital” 
is 
purely 
a 
theoretical 
concept 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
a 
definite 
method 
of 
calculation 
and 
computation. 
The 
evolution 
of 
this 
concept 
of 
capital 
finally 
resulted 
in 
including 
in 
the 
accountant’s 
concept 
of 
capital, 
the 
auditor’s 
concept, 
and 
also 
those 
things 
that 
are 
not 
capital 
goods. 


The 
system 
of 
accountancy 
started, 
of 
course, 
with 
businessmen. 
Anxious 
to 
know 
what 
the 
results 
of 
their 
transactions 
were 
they 
developed 
this 
method 
of 
accounting—double-entry 
bookkeeping 
and 
so 
on. 
The 
concept 
of 
capital 
that 
they 
applied 
referred 
to, 
and 
included, 
only 
those 
funds 
that 
they 
had 
diverted 
to 
the 
development 
of 
business. 
It 
did 
not 
include 
real 
estate 
or 
the 
private 
property 
of 
the 
head 
of 
the 
enterprise, 
of 
his 
family, 
and 
so 
on. 
You 
can 
still 
read 
in 
legal 
treatises 
and 
papers 
essays 
debating 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
private 
capital 
of 
the 
owner 
should 
be 
included 
in 
the 
balance 
sheet 
of 
a 
firm. 
According 
to 
the 
methods 
in 
practice 
in 
accountancy, 
the 
concept 
of 
capital 
as 
used 
today 
includes 
the 
real 
estate 
and 
all 
rights 
owned 
by 
the 
enterprise. 


Agriculturists 
also 
began 
to 
pay 
attention 
to 
these 
problems, 
but 
only 
much 
later. 
In 
the 
beginning 
they 
developed 
methods 
of 
accounting 
which 
were 
limited 
to 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
farm 
only, 
without 
including 
the 
whole 
property 
of 
the 
owner. 
I 
mention 
these 
facts 
because 
if 
you 
look 
into 
the 
balance 
sheet 
of 
an 
enterprise 
there 
is 
room 
for 
the 
building, 
the 
real 
estate, 
owned 
by 
the 
enterprise. 
The 
concept 
of 
capital 
as 
used 
today 
includes 
more 
than 
capital 
goods; 
it 
includes 
all 
the 
things 
owned 
by 
the 
enterprise. 


From 
this 
point 
of 
view 
we 
must 
raise 
the 
question 
also 
of 
whether 
or 
not 
there 
are 
other 
distinctions 
which 
may 
have 
greater 
importance 
for 
the 
practical 
problems 
of 
capital. 
If 
we 
speak 
of 
capital 
we 
discover 
that 
we 
have 
in 
mind 
all 
the 
total 
material 
factors 
of 
production 
as 
far 
as 
they 
may 
be 
used 



for 
production 
purposes. 


If 
we 
talk 
about 
the 
decisions 
to 
be 
made 
concerning 
the 
employment 
of 
capital, 
we 
must 
take 
into 
account 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
capital 
available 
is 
embodied 
in 
nonconvertible 
or 
not 
perfectly 
convertible 
goods. 
Capital 
goods 
are 
intermediary 
factors 
between 
the 
natural 
goods 
and 
the 
final 
consumer’s 
goods. 
In 
a 
changing 
world, 
in 
which 
the 
productive 
processes 
and 
other 
things 
are 
constantly 
changing, 
the 
question 
is 
whether 
we 
can 
use 
these 
intermediary 
products, 
which 
were 
originally 
designed 
for 
a 
specific 
end 
use, 
for 
any 
other 
end. 
Is 
it 
possible, 
even 
after 
a 
change 
in 
plans 
and 
intentions, 
to 
use 
for 
other 
purposes 
capital 
accumulated 
or 
produced 
in 
the 
past 
with 
different 
plans 
and 
different 
intentions 
in 
mind? 
This 
is 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
convertibility 
of 
capital 
goods. 


For 
more 
than 
one 
hundred 
years, 
a 
movement 
popular 
in 
the 
whole 
world, 
today 
especially 
in 
California, 
is 
represented 
by 
a 
group 
of 
reformers 
who 
call 
themselves 
“technocrats.” 
Technocrats 
criticize 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
have 
still 
going 
on 
side 
by 
side 
with 
the 
most 
modern 
methods 
of 
production, 
processes 
of 
production 
of 
an 
outdated 
character. 
And 
they 
are 
not 
the 
only 
ones 
to 
criticize 
this 
fact. 
They 
point 
out 
how 
wonderful 
it 
would 
be 
if 
all 
that 
they 
call 
“economic 
backwardness” 
were 
eliminated, 
if 
we 
had 
all 
the 
factories 
located 
in 
the 
best 
places, 
and 
if 
all 
the 
factories 
were 
equipped 
with 
the 
most 
modern 
equipment. 
Then 
there 
wouldn’t 
be 
any 
backwardness, 
nor 
any 
machines 
and 
methods 
of 
production 
being 
used 
which 
are 
no 
longer 
up 
to 
date. 
There 
was 
a 
German, 
or 
a 
Russian—I 
had 
better 
say 
a 
Baltic— 
socialist 
who 
pointed 
out, 
for 
instance, 
how 
backward 
German 
agriculture 
was. 
He 
would 
abandon 
or 
diminish 
all 
existing 
farms 
and 
machines, 
substitute 
the 
most 
modern 
achievements 
of 
agriculture, 
and 
then 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
produce 
everything 
cheaper. 


The 
weak 
point 
of 
these 
plans 
is 
that 
the 
capital 
accumulated 
in 
the 
past 
was 
in 
the 
form 
of 
capital 
goods 
that 
represented 
the 
technical 
wisdom 
of 
the 
ages 
in 
which 
it 
was 
accumulated. 
Although 
the 
factories 
are 
out 
of 
date 
it 
does 
not 
necessarily 
mean 
that 
the 
old 
machines 
have 
to 
be 
sold 
as 
scrap 
iron 
and 
new 
machines 
substituted. 
It 
depends 
upon 
the 
superiority 
of 
the 
new 
machines. 
Unless 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
the 
old 
factory 
to 
make 
any 
surplus 
over 
current 
expenses, 
it 
would 
be 
a 
waste, 
not 
only 
both 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
individual 
factory 
owner 
but 
also 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
a 
socialistic 
system 
that 
had 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
same 
thing. 
The 
problem 
is 
similar 
to 
that 
of 
a 
man 
who 
must 
choose 
between 
buying 
a 
new 
typewriter 
or 
a 
new 
television 



set 
because 
better 
ones 
have 
now 
been 
invented, 
or 
buying 
something 
else 
that 
he 
doesn’t 
have 
at 
all. 
Just 
as 
not 
everybody 
will 
throw 
away 
his 
old 
typewriter 
or 
his 
car 
when 
a 
new 
model 
appears, 
so 
will 
a 
businessman 
have 
to 
make 
similar 
decisions 
in 
business. 
While 
in 
the 
household 
precise 
calculations 
are 
not 
needed, 
in 
business 
these 
decisions 
are 
made 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
more 
careful 
calculations. 


The 
capital 
equipment 
that 
makes 
up 
the 
wealth 
of 
our 
age 
and 
that 
also 
makes 
one 
country 
richer 
as 
against 
poorer 
countries 
is 
embodied 
in 
capital 
goods 
created 
in 
the 
past 
by 
our 
ancestors, 
or 
created 
by 
ourselves 
under 
different 
technical 
conditions 
and 
for 
different 
purposes. 
If 
we 
want 
to 
use 
this 
old 
capital 
equipment 
in 
the 
future, 
too, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
does 
not 
render 
as 
much 
service 
as 
new 
equipment, 
we 
do 
so 
because 
we 
consider 
the 
service 
it 
renders 
worth 
more 
than 
what 
we 
can 
gain 
by 
throwing 
away 
the 
old 
machines 
and 
replacing 
them 
with 
new 
machines. 


The 
settlement 
of 
the 
world 
was 
done 
in 
other 
ages 
under 
other 
assumptions 
and 
other 
conditions 
with 
other 
technical 
knowledge. 
If 
we 
were 
to 
come 
to 
earth 
from 
another 
planet 
with 
perfect 
knowledge 
of 
today’s 
geographical 
conditions, 
we 
would 
settle 
the 
world 
with 
the 
use 
of 
that 
other 
knowledge, 
knowledge 
very 
different 
from 
that 
which 
was 
responsible 
for 
our 
present 
capital 
equipment. 
In 
the 
past 
our 
wealth 
consisted 
to 
a 
great 
extent 
of 
capital 
goods 
adjusted 
to 
conditions 
which 
are 
different 
from 
our 
conditions. 
Decisions 
of 
the 
past 
were 
based 
on 
conditions 
at 
that 
time. 
The 
fact 
that 
our 
ancestors 
made 
the 
decisions 
they 
did 
helps 
to 
influence 
us 
to 
keep 
things 
as 
they 
are; 
it 
wouldn’t 
be 
worthwhile 
to 
abandon 
the 
investments 
of 
the 
past. 
In 
every 
individual 
case 
we 
have 
to 
make 
a 
decision 
between 
continuing 
in 
the 
old 
ways, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
now 
know 
better, 
or 
renouncing 
the 
old 
ways 
for 
some 
other 
employment 
of 
additional 
capital 
goods 
which 
we 
now 
consider 
more 
important. 


In 
answer 
to 
the 
technocrats, 
we 
say 
we 
are 
not 
rich 
enough 
to 
scrap 
everything 
that 
was 
built 
in 
the 
past. 
Perhaps 
it 
would 
be 
better 
to 
have 
the 
industrial 
centers 
somewhere 
else 
than 
where 
they 
were 
built 
in 
the 
past. 
But 
this 
transfer, 
this 
shifting, 
is 
a 
very 
slow 
process. 
It 
depends 
on 
the 
superiority 
of 
the 
new 
sites. 
This 
is 
a 
refutation 
of 
the 
famous 
infant-industry 
argument, 
which 
says 
that 
the 
new 
industries 
must 
be 
protected 
against 
the 
old 
industries. 
In 
this 
case 
too—in 
the 
case 
of 
shifting 
industries 
from 
physically 
less 
favorable 
to 
more 
favorable 
sites—the 
decision 
must 
depend 
on 
the 
degree 
of 
superiority 
of 
the 
new 
sites. 
If 
the 
superiority 
of 
the 
new 



sites 
is 
sufficient 
the 
industries 
will 
move 
without 
any 
outside 
assistance 
at 
all. 
If 
it 
is 
not 
sufficient, 
it 
is 
a 
waste 
to 
assist 
industries 
to 
make 
such 
a 
move. 
(For 
instance, 
the 
textile 
industries 
developed 
in 
New 
England 
even 
though 
the 
cotton 
was 
grown 
in 
the 
south. 
More 
lately 
the 
textile 
mills 
have 
been 
shifting 
to 
the 
south, 
again 
without 
any 
outside 
assistance.) 
If 
the 
advantage 
to 
be 
derived 
from 
the 
abandonment 
of 
capital 
goods 
is 
great 
enough, 
the 
change 
will 
be 
made. 


Technical 
backwardness 
is 
not 
the 
same 
as 
economic 
backwardness. 
If 
capital 
needed 
for 
eliminating 
this 
technical 
backwardness, 
from 
our 
point 
of 
view 
or 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
buying 
public, 
has 
a 
more 
urgent 
employment 
somewhere 
else, 
then 
it 
would 
be 
economically 
a 
very 
serious 
mistake 
to 
employ 
it 
in 
making 
changes 
to 
new 
equipment 
simply 
because 
there 
are 
already 
better 
machines. 


Capital 
goods 
are 
scarce. 
The 
economic 
problem 
consists 
precisely 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
consumers 
seek 
to 
employ 
them 
for 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
their 
most 
urgent 
not-yet-satisfied 
demands. 
The 
economic 
problem 
is 
not 
to 
employ 
capital 
goods 
for 
producing 
something 
which 
is 
less 
important 
than 
another 
product, 
which 
cannot 
be 
started 
precisely 
on 
account 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
these 
capital 
goods 
are 
being 
employed 
in 
the 
production 
of 
the 
less 
important 
product. 
This 
is 
what 
unprofitability 
means. 
A 
businessman 
says, 
“This 
is 
unprofitable. 
The 
project 
could 
be 
undertaken 
but 
it 
would 
be 
unprofitable. 
Therefore, 
we 
do 
not 
want 
to 
start 
it.” 
What 
the 
socialists 
say 
is, 
“But 
businessmen 
are 
greedy; 
they 
want 
to 
produce 
only 
those 
things 
which 
are 
profitable, 
not 
those 
which 
are 
unprofitable.” 
However, 
what 
makes 
an 
enterprise 
unprofitable 
is 
that, 
given 
the 
prices 
of 
the 
factors 
of 
production 
and 
the 
rate 
of 
interest, 
the 
anticipated 
proceeds 
would 
lag 
behind 
the 
expenditures. 


What 
does 
it 
mean 
if 
the 
price 
of 
copper 
is 
higher 
than 
it 
used 
to 
be? 
It 
means 
that 
consumers 
are 
ready 
to 
pay 
a 
higher 
price 
for 
the 
copper 
that 
goes 
into 
the 
making 
of 
other 
products; 
they 
are 
not 
ready 
to 
pay 
the 
higher 
price 
for 
copper 
in 
its 
present 
uses. 
They 
make 
some 
prices 
high 
enough 
to 
make 
the 
production 
of 
other 
products 
profitable. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
if 
there 
is 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
supply 
of 
copper, 
or 
if 
some 
branches 
of 
business 
which 
used 
to 
employ 
copper 
until 
now 
use 
something 
else 
instead 
of 
copper 
in 
production, 
then 
copper 
becomes 
more 
readily 
available, 
the 
price 
of 
copper 
drops, 
and 
it 
now 
becomes 
profitable 
to 
use 
copper 
to 
produce 
some 
things 
that 
yesterday 
were 
unprofitable. 
Ultimately 
it 
is 
the 
consumers, 
in 
their 



buying, 
who 
determine 
what 
should 
be 
produced 
and 
what 
should 
not 
be 
produced. 


When 
aluminum 
was 
first 
introduced, 
many 
things 
could 
not 
be 
produced 
from 
aluminum 
because 
its 
price 
was 
very 
high. 
Napoleon 
III 
[1808–1873] 
immediately 
had 
the 
idea 
to 
give 
to 
his 
cavalry 
armor 
of 
aluminum, 
but 
it 
was 
so 
expensive 
then 
that 
it 
would 
have 
been 
cheaper 
to 
give 
them 
armor 
made 
of 
silver. 
When 
I 
was 
a 
child, 
aluminum 
was 
used 
for 
children’s 
toys, 
but 
the 
really 
serious 
industrial 
use 
of 
aluminum 
was 
then 
more 
or 
less 
out 
of 
the 
question. 
Slowly 
the 
production 
of 
aluminum 
improved 
and 
the 
use 
of 
aluminum 
for 
many 
articles 
became 
possible. 
Years 
ago, 
it 
was 
as 
unprofitable 
to 
use 
aluminum 
as 
it 
is 
today 
to 
use 
some 
high-
grade 
metals 
for 
certain 
commercial 
purposes. 


The 
slogan 
“Production 
for 
use 
and 
not 
for 
profit” 
is 
meaningless. 
A 
businessman 
produces 
for 
profit. 
But 
he 
can 
make 
profits 
only 
because 
consumers 
want 
to 
use 
the 
things 
he 
produces, 
because 
they 
want 
to 
use 
them 
more 
urgently 
than 
other 
things. 


In 
the 
absence 
of 
profits 
and 
losses 
there 
wouldn’t 
be 
any 
guides 
for 
production. 
It 
is 
profits 
or 
losses 
that 
show 
the 
businessmen 
what 
the 
consumers 
are 
asking 
for 
most 
urgently, 
in 
what 
qualities 
and 
in 
what 
quantities. 
In 
a 
system 
in 
which 
there 
were 
no 
profits 
or 
losses, 
the 
businessman 
would 
not 
know 
what 
the 
wishes 
of 
the 
consumers 
were, 
and 
he 
wouldn’t 
be 
able 
to 
arrange 
his 
production 
processes 
according 
to 
the 
wishes 
of 
the 
consumers. 


Besides 
this 
function 
of 
profit 
or 
loss 
there 
is 
the 
role 
they 
play 
in 
shifting 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
those 
who 
knew—in 
the 
past, 
of 
course, 
i.e., 
until 
yesterday—how 
best 
to 
employ 
them 
for 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
consumers. 
This 
is 
no 
guarantee 
that 
the 
means 
of 
production 
will 
be 
used 
in 
the 
best 
way 
tomorrow. 
But 
if 
they 
aren’t, 
the 
owners 
will 
suffer 
losses. 
And 
if 
they 
do 
not 
change 
their 
methods 
of 
production, 
they 
will 
lose 
their 
property 
and 
will 
be 
thrown 
out 
of 
their 
eminent 
position 
as 
the 
owners 
of 
factors 
of 
production. 
But 
this 
is 
something 
given, 
and 
it 
cannot 
be 
changed. 
Every 
judgment 
about 
people 
refers 
to 
the 
past. 
A 
candidate 
in 
an 
election 
can 
only 
be 
judged 
by 
what 
he 
has 
done 
in 
the 
past. 
The 
same 
applies 
also 
to 
the 
choice 
of 
a 
doctor, 
a 
shop, 
and 
so 
on, 
and 
also 
to 
producers. 
It 
is 
always 
good 
will 
referring 
to 
the 
past. 


Past 
profits 
shift 
the 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
from 
the 
hands 
of 
those 
who 
were 
less 
efficient 
in 
using 
them 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
public 



into 
the 
hands 
of 
those 
who 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
more 
efficient. 
Therefore, 
the 
meaning 
of 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
is 
very 
different 
in 
a 
system 
based 
on 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
from 
its 
meaning 
in 
a 
feudal 
system. 
In 
a 
feudal 
system, 
private 
ownership 
was 
acquired 
by 
conquest 
or 
by 
the 
arbitrary 
appropriation 
of 
pieces 
of 
land. 
The 
proprietor 
was 
the 
conqueror; 
the 
supreme 
conqueror 
was 
the 
head 
of 
the 
army, 
the 
king, 
the 
“Führer.” 
Other 
people 
acquired 
private 
property 
as 
gifts 
from 
the 
supreme 
lord. 
There 
was 
a 
whole 
hierarchy—kings, 
dukes, 
knights, 
and 
so 
on, 
and 
at 
the 
bottom 
were 
the 
people 
with 
no 
property. 
The 
dukes 
and 
knights 
could 
lose 
their 
property 
by 
being 
deprived 
of 
their 
“gift” 
by 
the 
higher 
authority—the 
king— 
revoking 
his 
gift; 
or 
they 
might 
be 
defeated 
by 
a 
successful 
conqueror. 
This 
system 
prevailed 
until 
capitalism 
replaced 
it 
to 
varying 
degrees 
in 
many 
countries. 


If 
you 
study 
the 
history 
of 
private 
ownership 
in 
land 
you 
can, 
of 
course, 
go 
back 
either 
to 
conquest 
or 
to 
appropriation 
of 
ownerless 
property 
by 
somebody. 
From 
this 
point 
of 
view, 
the 
older 
critics 
of 
private 
ownership 
said 
property 
does 
not 
have 
a 
legal 
origin; 
it 
was 
acquired 
by 
might, 
by 
conquest, 
without 
any 
legal 
basis. 
Hence, 
they 
say 
they 
want 
to 
take 
it 
away 
from 
the 
current 
private 
owners 
and 
give 
it 
to 
everybody. 
Whether 
the 
origin 
described 
here 
is 
right 
or 
wrong 
is 
one 
question. 
Another 
question 
is 
what 
to 
do 
now 
that 
property 
is 
privately 
owned. 


The 
socialists 
took 
over 
this 
critique 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
property 
without 
realizing 
the 
enormous 
difference 
that 
existed 
between 
then 
and 
now. 
If 
you 
say 
that 
in 
the 
old 
days 
the 
owners 
of 
land 
did 
not 
depend 
on 
the 
market, 
that 
is 
true; 
there 
was 
no 
market; 
there 
was 
only 
an 
insignificant 
amount 
of 
trade. 
The 
feudal 
lord 
had 
only 
one 
real 
way 
to 
spend 
his 
great 
income 
in 
the 
products 
of 
the 
earth—to 
retain 
a 
great 
retinue 
of 
armed 
men 
in 
order 
to 
fight 
his 
battles. 
The 
court 
of 
a 
feudal 
lord 
consisted 
of 
an 
enormous 
household 
in 
which 
many 
people 
lived 
(boarders 
I 
would 
say), 
supported 
by 
the 
great 
estate. 
In 
Brandenburg 
in 
Berlin, 
for 
instance, 
there 
was 
one 
case 
of 
a 
councilor 
in 
the 
sixteenth 
century 
who 
was 
living 
in 
the 
king’s 
household. 
This 
is 
very 
different 
from 
the 
conditions 
in 
the 
market 
economy. 


In 
the 
market 
economy, 
private 
ownership 
is, 
as 
it 
were, 
a 
social 
function 
because 
it 
can 
be 
retained 
and 
enlarged 
only 
by 
serving 
customers 
in 
the 
cheapest 
and 
best 
possible 
way. 
Those 
who 
do 
not 
know 
how 
to 
serve 
consumers 
in 
the 
cheapest 
and 
best 
possible 
way 
suffer 
losses. 
If 
they 
do 
not 
change 
their 
methods 
of 
production 
in 
time 
they 
are 
thrown 
out 
of 
their 



positions 
as 
owners, 
entrepreneurs, 
capitalists, 
and 
shifted 
to 
positions 
in 
which 
they 
no 
longer 
have 
entrepreneurial 
and 
capitalistic 
functions. 
Therefore, 
the 
meaning 
of 
private 
ownership 
in 
the 
capitalistic 
system 
is 
entirely 
different 
from 
the 
meaning 
of 
private 
ownership 
in 
the 
feudal 
system. 


Critics 
of 
private 
ownership 
are 
still 
living 
mentally 
in 
the 
Middle 
Ages 
(like 
critics 
of 
interest 
and 
creditors). 
They 
don’t 
realize 
that 
the 
market 
determines 
every 
day 
who 
should 
own 
what 
and 
how 
much 
he 
should 
own. 
The 
market 
gives 
ownership 
to 
those 
people 
who 
are 
best 
fitted 
to 
use 
the 
means 
of 
production 
for 
the 
best 
possible 
satisfaction 
of 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
consumers. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
not 
correct 
to 
criticize 
the 
institutions 
of 
private 
property 
by 
citing 
conditions 
as 
they 
existed 
in 
the 
early 
days 
under 
feudal 
conditions, 
under 
absolute 
kings. 


As 
President 
Franklin 
Roosevelt 
[1882–1945] 
said, 
capitalism 
has 
never 
been 
really 
tried.1 
There 
always 
remains 
something 
from 
the 
old 
days. 
But 
it 
is 
absolutely 
useless 
to 
tell 
us 
today, 
“Look 
how 
the 
wealth 
of 
many 
aristocratic 
families 
originated 
in 
the 
seventeenth 
century.” 
Some 
modern 
wealthy 
people 
may 
be 
descendants 
of 
wealthy 
aristocratic 
families, 
but 
what 
has 
that 
to 
do 
with 
the 
situation 
today? 
The 
Prussian 
Junkers 
were 
still 
privileged 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
and 
early 
twentieth 
century; 
they 
could 
retain 
their 
property 
only 
because 
the 
whole 
apparatus 
of 
the 
imperial 
government 
was 
glad 
to 
preserve 
them, 
to 
protect 
them, 
and 
to 
prevent 
consumers 
from 
putting 
persons 
in 
their 
places 
who 
were 
better 
equipped 
to 
serve 
consumers. 


We 
must 
realize 
that 
every 
governmental 
measure 
that 
lowers 
the 
amount 
of 
profit 
successful 
enterprises 
can 
make 
or 
which 
taxes 
away 
their 
profits 
is 
a 
measure 
that 
weakens 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
consumers 
over 
producers. 
For 
example, 
the 
great 
industrial 
fortunes 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
were 
acquired 
by 
successful 
innovators 
in 
their 
business. 
Henry 
Ford 
[1863–1947] 
started 
with 
almost 
nothing; 
he 
made 
enormous 
profits 
which 
were 
plowed 
back 
in 
his 
enterprise; 
in 
this 
way 
over 
a 
comparatively 
short 
time 
he 
developed 
one 
of 
the 
biggest 
fortunes 
of 
the 
United 
States. 
The 
result 
was 
that 
something 
quite 
new 
happened, 
mass 
production 
of 
automobiles 
for 
the 
masses. 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century 
there 
were 
some 
successful 
motor 
cars. 
The 
French 
Renault 
cost 
about 
$10,000 
in 
gold; 
it 
was 
a 
luxury 
car 
for 
a 
few 
very 
rich 
men. 
The 
activities 
of 
Ford 
and 
of 
some 
other 
people 
made 
the 
motor 
car 
something 
for 
everybody. 
In 
this 
way 
great 
fortunes 
were 
developed. 
The 
great 
department 
stores 
and 
the 
great 
factories 



developed 
in 
this 
way. 
But 
now 
this 
cannot 
happen. 
If 
a 
man 
starts 
a 
small 
enterprise 
and 
makes 
huge 
profits, 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
this 
profit 
is 
absorbed 
by 
taxes. 
However, 
there 
are 
still 
some 
loopholes. 
If 
you 
have 
a 
good 
accountant 
you 
may 
avoid 
being 
expropriated 
90 
percent 
and 
may 
be 
expropriated 
only 
70 
percent. 
But 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
profits 
which 
would 
have 
been 
reinvested 
are 
taken 
by 
the 
government 
and 
spent 
for 
current 
expenses. 


In 
the 
case 
of 
department 
stores, 
formerly 
an 
old 
store 
had 
to 
compete 
for 
potential 
new 
consumers 
with 
new 
competitors. 
Today 
this 
is 
no 
longer 
the 
case. 
The 
small 
man 
will 
never 
develop 
into 
a 
big 
store 
because 
his 
profits 
are 
taken 
away 
by 
the 
government. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
old 
and 
new 
stores 
operate 
under 
the 
same 
laws; 
the 
large 
old 
store 
also 
has 
to 
pay 
high 
income 
taxes. 
But 
the 
old 
store 
has 
already 
accumulated 
the 
capital 
needed 
for 
a 
big 
business, 
while 
the 
new 
man 
is 
prevented 
from 
accumulating 
the 
capital 
needed 
to 
expand 
into 
a 
big-scale 
enterprise. 
The 
consequence, 
therefore, 
is 
that 
the 
competitive 
spirit 
could 
easily 
disappear 
from 
the 
management 
of 
the 
big 
store. 
Without 
any 
danger 
to 
the 
old 
store 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
its 
affairs, 
the 
old 
store 
may 
sometimes 
become 
“lazy.” 


There 
are 
people 
who 
say 
capitalism 
is 
dying 
because 
the 
spirit 
of 
competition 
no 
longer 
exists 
as 
it 
used 
to 
and 
because 
great 
enterprises 
become 
bureaucratic. 
But 
capitalism 
is 
not 
dying; 
people 
are 
murdering 
it. 
There 
is 
a 
difference 
between 
dying 
by 
a 
disease 
that 
finally 
results 
in 
death 
and 
dying 
as 
a 
result 
of 
assault 
and 
assassination. 
It 
is 
fantastic 
to 
use 
as 
an 
argument 
against 
capitalism 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
competitive 
spirit 
in 
business 
is 
weakening 
and 
that 
businesses 
sometimes 
become 
bureaucratic. 
This 
is 
precisely 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
people 
are 
fighting 
against 
the 
capitalistic 
system 
and 
don’t 
want 
to 
tolerate 
the 
institutions 
that 
are 
essential 
for 
its 
existence. 
Therefore, 
I 
must 
say 
something 
about 
the 
difference 
between 
profit 
and 
loss 
under 
business 
management 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
bureaucratic 
management 
on 
the 
other 
hand. 


Profit-and-loss 
management 
is 
the 
sign 
of 
an 
enterprise, 
of 
an 
outfit, 
that 
is 
subject 
to 
the 
supremacy 
of 
the 
market, 
i.e., 
the 
supremacy 
of 
consumers. 
In 
such 
an 
outfit 
the 
determining 
factor 
is 
“Is 
it 
profitable 
or 
not?” 
This 
yardstick 
is 
applied 
not 
only 
to 
the 
whole 
enterprise 
but 
to 
every 
portion 
of 
the 
enterprise. 
This 
is 
the 
method 
of 
double-entry 
accounting 
which 
Goethe 
characterized 
in 
such 
a 
wonderful 
way 
by 
saying 
that 
it 
makes 
it 
possible 
for 
the 
man 
at 
the 
head 
of 
an 
organization 
to 
control 
every 
aspect 
of 
a 
business 



without 
becoming 
enmeshed 
in 
too 
much 
detail 
work. 


Under 
such 
an 
accounting 
system 
you 
can 
establish 
whether 
or 
not 
any 
special 
department 
or 
branch 
pays. 
For 
instance, 
an 
enterprise 
in 
New 
York 
has 
a 
branch 
store 
in 
San 
Francisco. 
There 
is 
only 
one 
standard 
the 
head 
of 
the 
company 
in 
New 
York 
need 
apply: 
is 
it 
profitable? 
He 
has 
a 
special 
balance 
sheet 
for 
the 
store 
in 
San 
Francisco. 
He 
assigns 
to 
this 
branch 
on 
his 
books 
the 
necessary 
capital, 
compares 
the 
costs 
and 
the 
prices 
of 
this 
branch, 
and 
on 
this 
basis 
judges 
whether 
or 
not 
it 
is 
useful, 
whether 
or 
not 
it 
is 
profitable, 
for 
the 
total 
enterprise 
to 
continue 
this 
branch 
office 
in 
San 
Francisco. 
He 
can 
leave 
all 
the 
details 
to 
the 
head 
of 
the 
branch 
office 
in 
San 
Francisco 
because 
this 
man 
always 
knows 
that 
he 
is 
responsible. 
It 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
the 
branch 
manager 
get 
a 
share 
of 
the 
profits. 
He 
knows 
very 
well 
that 
if 
the 
branch 
does 
not 
pay 
it 
will 
be 
discontinued 
and 
he 
will 
lose 
his 
job; 
his 
future 
depends 
on 
this 
branch. 
Therefore, 
the 
man 
in 
New 
York 
does 
not 
have 
to 
say 
to 
this 
branch 
manager 
in 
San 
Francisco 
anything 
more 
than, 
“Make 
profits!” 
The 
head 
in 
New 
York 
doesn’t 
interfere 
because 
if 
he 
does 
and 
the 
branch 
office 
has 
losses, 
the 
branch 
manager 
will 
be 
able 
to 
say 
it 
was 
because 
“You 
ordered 
me 
to 
do 
so 
and 
so.” 


The 
consumers 
are 
supreme. 
The 
consumers 
are 
not 
always 
intelligent— 
not 
at 
all—but 
the 
consumers 
are 
sovereign. 
They 
can 
be 
stupid 
and 
they 
may 
change 
their 
minds, 
but 
we 
must 
accept 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
are 
sovereign. 
Businessmen 
are 
subject 
to 
the 
supremacy 
of 
the 
consumers. 
The 
same 
is, 
of 
course, 
true 
for 
the 
whole 
business 
establishment; 
the 
decisive 
voice 
is 
the 
voice 
of 
the 
consumers. 
It 
is 
not 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
producers 
or 
manufacturers 
to 
criticize 
consumers, 
to 
say, 
“These 
people 
have 
bad 
tastes— 
I 
recommend 
they 
buy 
something 
else.” 
This 
is 
the 
task 
of 
philosophers 
and 
artists. 
A 
great 
painter, 
a 
great 
leader, 
a 
man 
who 
wants 
to 
play 
a 
role 
in 
history 
must 
not 
yield 
to 
the 
bad 
taste 
of 
consumers. 
However, 
businessmen 
are 
subject 
to 
profit-and-loss 
management 
and 
are 
directed 
in 
every 
detail 
by 
the 
wishes 
of 
the 
consumers. 
The 
consumers 
are 
supreme; 
they 
are 
buying 
the 
product 
and 
this 
is 
justification 
for 
the 
producer. 
If 
it 
is 
not 
weakened 
by 
government 
interference, 
this 
is 
profit-and-loss 
management, 
production 
for 
consumers. 


Now 
what 
is 
bureaucratic 
management? 
People 
often 
confuse 
bigness 
with 
bureaucracy. 
Even 
such 
an 
eminent 
man 
as 
Max 
Weber 
[1864–1920] 
thought 
that 
the 
essential 
factor 
of 
a 
bureaucracy 
was 
that 
people 
sat 
at 
desks 
and 
had 
a 
lot 
of 
paperwork 
to 
do. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
the 
essential 
feature 
of 
a 



bureaucracy. 
The 
characteristic 
of 
a 
bureaucracy 
is 
that 
it 
deals 
with 
things 
which 
are 
necessary 
but 
which 
cannot 
be 
sold 
and 
that 
do 
not 
have 
a 
price 
on 
the 
market. 
Such 
a 
thing, 
for 
instance, 
is 
the 
protection 
of 
individuals 
against 
gangsters 
and 
other 
criminals. 
This 
is 
the 
job 
of 
the 
police 
department. 
It 
is 
very 
important, 
indispensable. 
But 
the 
services 
of 
the 
police 
department 
cannot 
be 
sold 
on 
the 
market. 
Therefore, 
you 
cannot 
judge 
the 
results 
of 
these 
police 
operations 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
you 
can 
judge 
the 
operations 
of 
a 
shoe 
factory. 
The 
shoe 
factory 
can 
say, 
“The 
public 
approves 
of 
our 
operations 
because 
we 
make 
profits.” 
The 
police 
department 
can 
only 
say 
the 
public 
approves 
through 
the 
actions 
of 
its 
town 
council, 
congress, 
parliament, 
and 
so 
on. 
Therefore, 
the 
system 
of 
management 
which 
must 
be 
used 
for 
a 
police 
system 
is 
the 
bureaucratic 
system. 


The 
nation, 
or 
the 
citizenry, 
elects 
parliamentary 
bodies 
and 
these 
parliamentary 
bodies 
determine 
how 
much 
should 
be 
spent 
for 
the 
various 
functions 
of 
the 
government, 
including 
the 
police 
department. 
You 
cannot 
evaluate 
in 
dollars 
and 
pennies 
the 
results 
of 
a 
police 
department. 
And, 
therefore, 
you 
cannot 
have 
bookkeeping 
and 
auditing 
of 
a 
police 
department 
in 
the 
same 
way 
you 
do 
in 
private 
businesses. 
In 
private 
businesses, 
the 
expenses 
are 
measured 
in 
terms 
of 
dollars 
against 
the 
proceeds. 
In 
the 
police 
department 
you 
cannot 
measure 
the 
expenses 
against 
the 
proceeds. 
The 
police 
department 
has 
only 
expenses. 
The 
“proceeds” 
of 
a 
police 
department 
are, 
for 
instance, 
the 
fact 
that 
you 
can 
walk 
safely 
through 
the 
town, 
even 
after 
midnight. 
Such 
proceeds 
cannot 
be 
evaluated 
in 
terms 
of 
money. 


The 
parliaments 
set 
the 
budget 
for 
the 
police 
department; 
they 
determine 
the 
amount 
of 
money 
to 
be 
spent. 
They 
must 
also 
tell 
the 
police 
department 
what 
services 
they 
should 
perform. 
The 
FBI 
could 
no 
doubt 
be 
improved 
by 
increasing 
its 
appropriations, 
but 
it 
is 
the 
will 
of 
the 
people 
that 
it 
not 
go 
any 
further; 
the 
head 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Justice 
tells 
the 
FBI 
what 
to 
do 
and 
what 
not 
to 
do; 
the 
Department 
of 
Justice 
head 
cannot 
leave 
these 
decisions 
to 
the 
“branch 
managers.” 
Therefore, 
the 
manager 
of 
a 
bureaucratic 
operation 
issues 
instructions 
on 
many 
things 
which 
appear 
unnecessary 
to 
the 
businessman—how 
often 
to 
clean 
the 
offices, 
how 
many 
telephones 
to 
have, 
how 
many 
men 
to 
watch 
a 
certain 
building, 
and 
so 
forth. 
These 
detailed 
instructions 
are 
necessary 
because 
in 
a 
bureaucracy 
what 
has 
to 
be 
done 
and 
what 
has 
not 
to 
be 
done 
must 
be 
determined 
by 
such 
rules. 
Otherwise 
the 
man 
on 
the 
spot 
would 
spend 
money 
without 
giving 
heed 
to 
the 
total 
budget. 
If 
there 
is 
a 
limited 
budget 
you 
must 
tell 
the 
employees 
what 
they 
can 
and 
what 



they 
cannot 
do. 
This 
refers 
to 
all 
branches 
of 
government 
administration. 


This 
is 
bureaucracy, 
and 
in 
these 
areas 
it 
is 
indispensable. 
You 
cannot 
leave 
it 
to 
the 
individual 
employee; 
you 
cannot 
tell 
a 
man, 
“Here 
is 
a 
big 
hospital. 
Do 
what 
you 
want 
with 
it.” 
A 
limit 
is 
drawn 
by 
the 
parliament, 
the 
state, 
or 
the 
union 
and, 
therefore, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
limit 
the 
money 
spent 
in 
each 
department. 
This 
bureaucratic 
method 
of 
management 
does 
not 
apply 
under 
profit 
management. 
But, 
of 
course, 
if 
you 
weaken 
the 
profit 
motive 
of 
private 
businesses, 
bureaucratic 
ideas 
and 
bureaucratic 
management 
creeps 
in. 


Given 
the 
present-day 
excess-profits 
tax, 
corporation 
taxes, 
and 
individual 
taxes 
on 
corporation 
shareholders, 
many 
enterprises 
say 
when 
calculating 
a 
new 
expenditure, 
“It 
means 
an 
expenditure 
of 
$100 
more, 
of 
course. 
But 
considering 
the 
82 
percent 
tax 
I 
must 
pay 
on 
the 
firm’s 
earnings, 
it 
will 
cost 
much 
less. 
If 
I 
don’t 
spend 
this 
$100 
on 
business, 
I 
will 
still 
have 
to 
pay 
a 
tax 
of 
$82. 
Therefore, 
spending 
this 
$100 
will 
cost 
the 
firm 
only 
$18.” 
People 
calculating 
this 
way 
no 
longer 
compare 
the 
total 
expenditure 
with 
the 
advantages 
to 
be 
derived 
from 
it 
on 
the 
market; 
they 
compare 
only 
that 
part 
of 
the 
expenditures 
which 
affects 
their 
own 
income. 
In 
other 
words, 
in 
spending 
$100 
on 
its 
business, 
the 
company 
could 
afford 
to 
be 
lavish, 
wasteful, 
or 
extravagant; 
it 
would 
no 
longer 
consider 
consumer 
wishes 
primarily. 


If 
this 
tax 
system 
is 
continued, 
it 
could 
lead 
finally 
to 
complete 
government 
control. 
For 
instance, 
if 
government 
takes 
100 
percent 
of 
a 
company’s 
income, 
its 
business 
expenses 
would 
all 
be 
deductible 
and 
chargeable 
to 
the 
government. 
The 
company 
wouldn’t 
need 
to 
worry 
then 
about 
consumer 
sovereignty, 
about 
whether 
consumers 
would 
be 
willing 
to 
pay 
enough 
for 
their 
product 
to 
cover 
costs; 
it 
wouldn’t 
need 
to 
worry 
about 
keeping 
expenses 
down. 
But 
then 
the 
government 
couldn’t 
allow 
the 
business 
to 
do 
as 
it 
wished; 
the 
government 
would 
have 
to 
control 
all 
aspects 
of 
the 
business’s 
operations. 
Therefore, 
if 
you 
hear 
that 
business 
is 
becoming 
bureaucratic 
and 
wasteful, 
it 
is 
not 
the 
consequence 
of 
big 
business, 
of 
capitalism, 
of 
an 
unhampered 
market 
system; 
it 
is 
the 
consequence 
of 
government 
taxation 
and 
government 
interference 
with 
these 
things.

9TH 
LECTURE 



Foreign 
Investments 
and 
the 
Spirit 
of 
Capitalism 


THREE 
HUNDRED 
YEARS 
AGO, 
economic 
conditions 
in 
the 
world 
were 
more 
uniform 
than 
at 
present. 
There 
were 
some 
savage 
tribes, 
of 
course, 
but 
except 
for 
them 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
world 
by 
and 
large 
had 
reached 
the 
same 
level 
of 
technological 
development 
and 
civilization. 
Then 
there 
came 
a 
radical 
change 
in 
some 
countries. 
Capitalism 
developed 
in 
the 
West; 
there 
was 
an 
accumulation 
and 
investment 
of 
capital; 
tools 
were 
perfected; 
Western 
civilization 
developed. 
Today 
there 
is 
an 
immense 
difference 
between 
Western 
civilization 
in 
the 
“advanced” 
countries 
of 
the 
world 
and 
conditions 
in 
the 
“backward” 
countries. 


This 
distinction 
was 
even 
somewhat 
sharper 
in 
the 
early 
and 
middle 
part 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century. 
A 
man 
who 
visited 
England 
and 
Romania 
in 
1700 
would 
not 
have 
seen 
any 
remarkable 
differences 
in 
the 
methods 
of 
production. 
By 
the 
year 
1850, 
these 
differences 
were 
enormous. 
These 
differences 
were 
then 
so 
considerable 
that 
one 
could 
say, 
and 
some 
people 
believed, 
that 
the 
disparities 
would 
never 
disappear, 
that 
they 
would 
remain 
forever. 


These 
differences 
consisted 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
was 
greater 
capital 
investment, 
very 
much 
greater 
capital 
investment, 
in 
the 
West. 
But 
this 
capital 
investment, 
these 
capital 
goods 
are 
nothing 
but 
intermediate 
products. 
The 
head 
start 
these 
countries 
had 
attained 
over 
the 
“backward” 
countries 
consisted 
only 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
time. 
The 
Western 
nations 
had 
started 
earlier 
on 
the 
road 
toward 
improving 
economic 
conditions. 
The 
“backward” 
countries 
had 
still 
to 
begin. 
But 
there 
was 
time. 
It 
would 
have 
been 
a 
slow 
process. 
However, 
these 
backward 
nations 
would 
have 
found 
enterprise 
much 
easier, 
for 
there 
was 
no 
need 
for 
them 
to 
make 
experiments 
with 
unsuccessful 
methods 
of 
production. 
They 
didn’t 
have 
to 
make 
the 
inventions 
anew; 
they 
could 
simply 
take 
them 
over 
from 
the 
Western 
countries. 
In 
time, 
this 
would 
have 
reduced 
the 
discrepancy 
in 
economic 
levels, 
but 
some 
difference 
would 
have 
remained. 



There 
was 
no 
secrecy 
about 
the 
technological 
inventions 
of 
Western 
civilization. 
The 
most 
intelligent 
young 
men 
in 
the 
“backward” 
countries 
went 
to 
schools 
in 
the 
West 
to 
learn 
all 
they 
could 
about 
methods 
of 
production. 
Then 
they 
could 
bring 
Western 
technology 
to 
their 
own 
countries. 
But 
technology 
was 
not 
the 
only 
thing. 
What 
was 
lacking 
in 
the 
“backward” 
countries 
was 
the 
mentality 
that 
had 
produced 
capitalism 
in 
the 
West 
and 
the 
institutions 
brought 
about 
by 
that 
mentality. 


Capitalism 
couldn’t 
develop 
in 
the 
“backward” 
nations 
because 
the 
people 
didn’t 
like 
capitalism, 
and 
because 
businessmen 
there 
were 
exposed 
to 
dangers 
which 
didn’t 
exist 
in 
the 
West 
where 
there 
was 
the 
Rule 
of 
Law. 
The 
important 
thing 
for 
these 
“backward” 
nations, 
which 
were 
mostly 
in 
the 
East, 
was 
to 
change 
radically 
their 
mentality, 
their 
idea 
of 
economics. 
They 
had 
to 
recognize 
that 
the 
greater 
the 
number 
of 
rich 
there 
are, 
the 
better 
it 
is 
for 
the 
poor, 
that 
the 
presence 
of 
rich 
people 
is 
necessary 
for 
the 
abolition 
of 
the 
poverty 
of 
the 
masses. 
But 
this 
idea 
didn’t 
enter 
into 
the 
minds 
of 
these 
people. 
The 
farther 
they 
were 
from 
Europe, 
the 
less 
they 
realized 
that 
the 
essence 
of 
capitalistic 
development 
was 
not 
the 
technological 
knowledge 
and 
capital 
goods 
but 
the 
mentality 
which 
had 
made 
it 
possible 
to 
accumulate 
large-scale 
capital 
and 
capital 
goods. 


The 
people 
in 
the 
“backward” 
nations, 
especially 
those 
in 
Asia, 
saw 
only 
their 
technological 
backwardness. 
If 
these 
countries 
had 
powerful 
governments, 
powerful 
in 
dominating 
their 
own 
country, 
what 
they 
wanted 
first 
of 
all, 
what 
they 
envied 
most 
of 
all, 
was 
the 
better 
weaponry 
produced 
by 
the 
West. 
These 
kings 
of 
the 
East 
were 
interested 
first 
of 
all 
in 
getting 
better 
guns; 
they 
were 
little 
interested 
in 
other 
things. 
But 
the 
patriots 
who 
did 
not 
consider 
war 
as 
the 
most 
important 
manifestation 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
were 
interested 
in 
technology. 
So 
they 
sent 
their 
sons 
to 
technological 
universities 
in 
the 
West 
and 
invited 
professors 
and 
industrialists 
from 
the 
West 
to 
come 
to 
their 
countries. 
But 
they 
didn’t 
grasp 
the 
real 
difference 
between 
the 
East 
and 
the 
West, 
the 
difference 
in 
ideas. 


If 
the 
people 
in 
the 
“backward” 
nations 
had 
been 
left 
alone, 
they 
would 
probably 
never 
have 
improved 
conditions 
in 
their 
own 
countries; 
they 
probably 
wouldn’t 
have 
adopted 
the 
ideologies 
necessary 
to 
transform 
their 
countries 
into 
“modern” 
countries. 
Even 
if 
they 
had 
done 
this, 
it 
would 
have 
been 
a 
very 
slow 
process. 
It 
would 
have 
been 
necessary 
for 
them 
to 
start 
from 
the 
grass 
roots. 
First, 
they 
would 
have 
had 
to 
accumulate 
capital 
to 
construct, 
let 
us 
say, 
equipment 
for 
the 
mines, 
in 
order 
to 
produce 
ore 
and 
from 
this 
ore 



to 
produce 
metals, 
and 
then 
the 
railroads. 
It 
would 
have 
been 
a 
very 
long, 
slow 
process. 


But 
what 
really 
happened 
was 
a 
phenomenon 
that 
nobody 
in 
the 
eighteenth 
century 
had 
considered. 
What 
developed 
was 
foreign 
investment. 
Considered 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
world 
history, 
foreign 
investment 
was 
a 
most 
important 
phenomenon. 
Foreign 
investment 
meant 
that 
the 
capitalists 
in 
the 
West 
provided 
the 
capital 
required 
for 
the 
transformation 
of 
a 
part 
of 
the 
economic 
system 
of 
the 
“backward” 
countries 
into 
a 
modern 
society. 
This 
was 
something 
entirely 
new, 
something 
unknown 
in 
earlier 
ages. 
In 
1817, 
when 
Ricardo 
wrote 
his 
book 
On 
the 
Principles 
of 
Political 
Economy 
and 
Taxation, 
he 
simply 
assumed 
as 
a 
fact 
that 
there 
was 
no 
capital 
investment 
abroad. 


The 
capital 
investment 
that 
developed 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
was 
very 
different 
from 
what 
had 
taken 
place 
under 
the 
old 
colonial 
system 
as 
it 
developed 
from 
the 
fifteenth 
century 
on. 
Then 
it 
had 
been 
a 
search 
for 
agricultural 
materials, 
natural 
resources, 
and 
products 
that 
could 
not 
be 
obtained 
in 
Europe. 
A 
silly 
explanation 
of 
their 
desire 
to 
trade 
was 
that 
the 
colonial 
powers 
were 
interested 
in 
getting 
foreign 
markets 
for 
their 
production. 
Actually 
the 
colonial 
powers 
exploited 
the 
colonies 
in 
order 
to 
get 
materials; 
they 
were 
very 
happy 
when 
they 
didn’t 
have 
to 
give 
anything 
for 
the 
resources 
they 
wanted, 
when 
they 
could 
get 
the 
foreign 
products 
for 
nothing. 
These 
early 
colonists 
were 
more 
often 
pirates 
and 
robbers 
than 
tradesmen. 
They 
considered 
selling 
abroad 
only 
as 
a 
sort 
of 
emergency 
measure 
if 
they 
couldn’t 
get 
what 
they 
wanted 
without 
paying 
for 
it. 
They 
really 
had 
very 
little 
interest 
in 
investing—they 
only 
wanted 
the 
raw 
materials. 


Of 
course, 
they 
couldn’t 
prevent 
some 
citizens 
from 
their 
own 
countries 
from 
settling 
in 
these 
colonies 
and 
starting 
agricultural 
production. 
As 
a 
byproduct 
of 
these 
colonial 
ventures 
of 
the 
fifteenth–eighteenth 
centuries, 
some 
important 
colonies 
developed 
overseas. 
The 
most 
important, 
of 
course, 
was 
the 
United 
States, 
and 
secondly 
the 
Latin 
American 
countries. 
But 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
European 
merchants 
and 
tradesmen, 
there 
was 
little 
interest 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
some 
members 
of 
the 
lower 
classes 
migrated 
and 
settled 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
For 
a 
long 
time 
they 
probably 
considered 
the 
islands 
in 
the 
Caribbean 
more 
important 
because 
there 
they 
could 
produce 
something 
they 
wanted— 
sugar. 
The 
settlements 
in 
America 
were 
not 
a 
part 
of 
the 
old 
colonial 
policy; 
they 
developed 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 



government, 
at 
least 
not 
because 
of 
them. 


In 
the 
eighteenth 
century 
there 
was 
already 
some 
investment 
in 
the 
North 
American 
colonies, 
but 
it 
was 
not 
yet 
a 
phenomenon 
of 
great 
historical 
importance. 
The 
real 
foreign 
investment 
started 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
century. 
This 
foreign 
investment 
was 
different 
from 
the 
earlier 
colonial 
investment 
insofar 
as 
it 
took 
place 
in 
territories 
owned 
and 
ruled 
by 
foreign 
governments. 


This 
foreign 
investment 
was 
developed 
in 
two 
different 
ways. 
One 
development 
was 
the 
investment 
in 
colonies 
owned 
by 
the 
several 
colonial 
powers, 
i.e., 
in 
countries 
dependent 
on 
European 
nations, 
for 
instance, 
the 
British 
investments 
in 
India. 
But 
still 
more 
important 
were 
the 
investments 
in 
countries 
that 
were 
politically 
independent 
and 
some 
of 
which 
were 
highly 
developed, 
such 
as 
the 
United 
States. 
The 
American 
railroads, 
for 
instance, 
were 
built 
to 
a 
great 
extent 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
European 
capital. 
Investments 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
Canada, 
and 
Australia 
were 
different 
from 
investments 
in 
other 
foreign 
countries 
because 
those 
three 
countries 
were 
not 
“backward” 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
they 
lacked 
the 
business 
mentality. 
These 
investments 
had 
a 
very 
different 
history 
because 
they 
were 
really 
used 
in 
the 
best 
possible 
way, 
and 
also 
because 
they 
were 
later 
completely 
paid 
back. 
In 
the 
1860s 
and 
1870s 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
investment 
opportunities 
for 
Europeans 
was 
to 
invest 
in 
the 
United 
States. 


Capital 
investment 
in 
a 
country 
means, 
of 
course, 
what 
is 
called 
an 
“unfavorable 
balance 
of 
trade.” 
The 
United 
States 
imported 
capital 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
century. 
Therefore, 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
there 
was 
an 
excess, 
by 
and 
large, 
of 
imports 
to 
the 
United 
States 
over 
exports 
from 
the 
United 
States. 
But 
then 
from 
the 
last 
decade 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
on, 
the 
United 
States 
began 
to 
pay 
back 
the 
investments 
the 
Europeans 
had 
made. 
Then 
there 
was 
an 
excess 
of 
exports 
over 
imports; 
the 
balance 
of 
trade 
became, 
therefore, 
“active.” 
The 
difference 
was 
paid 
for 
by 
the 
purchases 
by 
U.S. 
citizens 
of 
American 
shares 
and 
bonds 
that 
before 
had 
been 
sold 
to 
Europeans. 
This 
went 
on 
until 
after 
World 
War 
I. 
The 
United 
States 
then 
became 
the 
greatest 
money 
lender 
and 
investor 
in 
the 
world. 


The 
capital 
from 
Europe, 
and 
later 
from 
North 
America, 
that 
came 
to 
these 
countries 
made 
it 
possible 
for 
European 
and 
North 
American 
countries 
to 
expand 
their 
economic 
systems. 
One 
result 
of 
these 
foreign 
investments 
was 
that 
certain 
branches 
of 
production 
were 
developed 
in 
countries 
where 
they 
wouldn’t 
have 
been 
developed 
at 
all, 
or 
where 
they 
would 
have 
been 
developed 
only 
much 
later 
and 
certainly 
not 
in 
the 
way 
in 
which 
they 
were 



actually 
developed. 
The 
consequences 
undoubtedly 
benefited 
both 
the 
countries 
that 
invested 
and 
the 
countries 
in 
which 
the 
investments 
had 
been 
made. 


Very 
soon 
an 
attitude 
hostile 
to 
foreign 
investors 
and 
foreign 
creditors 
developed 
in 
many 
of 
the 
countries 
which 
had 
benefited 
from 
this 
foreign 
investment. 
Such 
things 
even 
happened 
to 
some 
extent 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
One 
reason 
why 
the 
Confederate 
States 
didn’t 
get 
more 
than 
one 
small 
loan 
from 
Europe 
during 
the 
Civil 
War 
was 
that 
in 
their 
files 
Jefferson 
Davis 
[1808–1889] 
had 
a 
black 
mark 
against 
him. 
Before 
he 
became 
president 
of 
the 
Confederacy, 
Davis 
had 
worked 
to 
repudiate 
a 
state 
loan 
in 
Mississippi, 
and 
the 
European 
bankers 
at 
that 
time 
had 
a 
good 
memory. 
However, 
such 
things 
happened 
more 
often 
in 
other 
countries 
than 
they 
did 
in 
the 
United 
States. 


On 
the 
one 
hand 
some 
countries 
had 
a 
specific 
idea 
about 
how 
foreign 
investors 
and 
foreign 
creditors 
should 
be 
treated. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
there 
were 
European 
governments 
waiting 
to 
intervene 
when 
such 
conflicts 
became 
acute, 
to 
protect 
the 
“rights” 
as 
they 
said, 
of 
their 
citizens. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
these 
European 
governments 
were 
not 
very 
much 
interested 
in 
the 
“rights” 
of 
their 
citizens. 
What 
they 
wanted 
was 
a 
pretext 
for 
colonial 
conquest. 
After 
the 
Congress 
of 
Vienna 
[1814–1815], 
it 
was 
a 
very 
disagreeable 
situation 
to 
be 
an 
army 
officer 
in 
Europe 
which 
was, 
by 
and 
large, 
at 
peace. 
The 
governments, 
and 
especially 
their 
armies 
and 
navies, 
were 
anxious 
to 
gain 
success 
abroad. 
They 
wanted 
victories, 
and 
some 
governments 
believed 
that 
public 
opinion 
expected 
such 
victories. 
If 
they 
went 
to 
war, 
they 
might 
be 
defeated 
and 
their 
prestige 
would 
suffer. 
This 
led 
some 
of 
them 
to 
seek 
colonial 
exploitation. 
For 
instance, 
the 
government 
of 
Napoleon 
III, 
which 
suffered 
from 
really 
bad 
treatment 
of 
French 
investors 
in 
the 
Republic 
of 
Mexico, 
embarked 
in 
the 
1860s 
on 
a 
great 
adventure 
in 
Mexico. 
In 
the 
beginning, 
it 
brought 
some 
success 
to 
the 
French 
army, 
but 
it 
did 
not 
end 
as 
the 
French 
had 
hoped. 


The 
countries 
which 
had 
been 
benefited 
from 
foreign 
investment 
misunderstood 
the 
meaning 
and 
advantages 
of 
foreign 
investment. 
There 
was 
a 
popular 
movement 
against 
foreign 
investors. 
Throughout 
the 
world, 
the 
principle 
of 
national 
sovereignty 
became 
accepted; 
it 
was 
maintained 
that 
an 
outside 
nation 
does 
not 
have 
the 
right 
to 
interfere 
if 
the 
rights 
of 
its 
citizens 
in 
another 
country 
are 
being 
violated. 
This 
was 
called 
the 
sovereignty 
doctrine. 
We 
are 
not 
interested 
in 
the 
legal 
excuses 
for 
placing 
obstacles 
in 
the 
path 
of 



foreign 
investors. 
But 
the 
result 
of 
the 
whole 
movement 
was 
that 
foreign 
investments 
and 
foreign 
loans 
granted 
to 
a 
country 
were 
completely 
at 
the 
mercy 
of 
every 
sovereign 
nation. 
These 
countries 
declared 
the 
foreigners 
to 
be 
exploiters 
and 
they 
tried 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
presence 
of 
exploitation 
by 
various 
theories 
which 
are 
not 
worth 
mentioning. 


The 
Marxians 
provided 
several 
doctrines 
which 
related 
foreign 
investment 
to 
imperialism. 
They 
maintained 
imperialism 
is 
bad 
and 
must 
be 
abolished 
at 
any 
cost. 
These 
Marxian 
doctrines, 
especially 
those 
of 
Rosa 
Luxemburg 
[1871–1919], 
cannot 
be 
explained 
without 
entering 
into 
the 
whole 
value 
theory 
of 
Karl 
Marx. 
These 
Marxian 
doctrines 
of 
imperialism 
declared 
that 
foreign 
investment 
is 
both 
detrimental 
to 
the 
country 
from 
which 
capital 
is 
exported 
and 
detrimental 
to 
the 
country 
to 
which 
it 
is 
imported. 
Foreign 
investment 
is 
imperialism—imperialism 
means 
war—and 
therefore 
foreign 
countries 
are 
conquerors. 
The 
naïve 
reader 
of 
a 
newspaper 
is 
very 
astonished 
to 
learn 
that 
the 
United 
States, 
which 
is 
today 
practically 
the 
only 
country 
that 
can 
make 
foreign 
investments, 
is 
an 
imperialistic 
power 
and 
that 
a 
loan 
granted 
by 
the 
United 
States 
to 
another 
country 
means 
aggression 
against 
that 
country. 
This 
is 
a 
consequence 
of 
these 
ideas. 
But 
are 
they 
true? 
Did 
the 
capitalists 
of 
one 
country 
go 
into 
foreign 
countries, 
as 
this 
doctrine 
declares, 
in 
order 
to 
withhold 
capital 
and 
the 
advantages 
of 
additional 
capital 
investment 
from 
their 
own 
citizens? 


Let 
us 
look 
at 
the 
motives 
of 
an 
individual 
capitalist 
entrepreneur. 
Why 
did 
he 
not 
invest 
at 
home? 
Because 
he 
believed 
that 
investing 
abroad 
was 
more 
profitable 
than 
investing 
at 
home. 
Why 
was 
this 
the 
case? 
Because 
the 
consumers 
on 
the 
domestic 
market 
were 
asking 
more 
urgently 
for 
products 
which 
could 
be 
produced 
only 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
foreign 
resources 
than 
they 
were 
asking 
for 
products 
which 
could 
have 
been 
produced 
by 
an 
expansion 
of 
domestic 
industries. 
For 
example, 
until 
a 
short 
time 
ago 
Europe 
had 
practically 
no 
oil 
production. 
Except 
for 
a 
very 
small 
quantity 
of 
inferior 
quality 
oil 
in 
Romania 
and 
in 
a 
part 
of 
the 
Austro-Hungarian 
Empire 
that 
later 
became 
a 
part 
of 
Poland 
one 
could 
produce 
practically 
no 
oil 
in 
Europe. 
Therefore, 
instead 
of 
expanding 
European 
industries 
when 
consumers 
began 
to 
ask 
for 
more 
oil 
products, 
it 
became 
profitable 
to 
go 
to 
foreign 
countries 
and 
invest 
there 
in 
order 
to 
produce 
oil. 
The 
same 
was 
true 
of 
many 
other 
articles. 
For 
instance, 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
cooking 
fats 
and 
soaps 
produced 
in 
Europe 
were 
made 
from 
plants 
that 
couldn’t 
be 
grown 
in 
Europe. 
A 
great 
part 
of 
European 
consumption 
was 
consumption 
of 
things 
produced 
from 
raw 



materials 
that 
couldn’t 
be 
produced 
in 
Europe 
at 
all, 
or 
that 
could 
be 
produced 
there 
only 
at 
a 
much 
higher 
cost. 


At 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
when 
the 
question 
was 
protectionism 
against 
free 
trade, 
the 
slogan 
of 
the 
free 
traders 
in 
Britain 
was 
the 
simple 
Englishman’s 
breakfast 
table 
for 
which 
all 
the 
products 
were 
either 
directly 
or 
indirectly 
imported 
from 
abroad. 
Even 
if 
some 
of 
them 
were 
produced 
at 
home, 
it 
was 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
fertilizer 
or 
fodder 
from 
abroad. 
In 
order 
to 
develop 
the 
products 
for 
the 
Englishman’s 
breakfast, 
European 
investors 
went 
abroad 
and 
in 
the 
process 
they 
developed 
a 
demand 
for 
the 
products 
of 
English 
manufacturers. 
They 
also 
had 
to 
establish 
transport 
systems, 
harbors, 
and 
so 
on. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
simply 
not 
true 
that 
European 
consumers 
and 
then 
later 
American 
consumers 
were 
hurt 
by 
capital 
exports; 
the 
capital 
was 
exported 
to 
invest 
in 
the 
production 
of 
things 
that 
European 
and 
American 
consumers 
wanted. 
The 
domestic 
resources 
of 
the 
European 
nations 
were 
lamentably 
insufficient; 
it 
would 
have 
been 
impossible 
for 
them 
to 
feed 
and 
clothe 
their 
populations 
out 
of 
domestic 
resources. 
In 
spite 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
are 
now 
seven 
times 
more 
people 
in 
England 
than 
at 
the 
start 
of 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution,1 
the 
standard 
of 
living 
is 
incomparably 
higher. 
This 
was 
possible 
only 
because 
capital 
had 
been 
invested 
and 
large-scale 
production 
had 
been 
started 
in 
England 
and 
abroad—railroads, 
mines, 
and 
so 
on. 


On 
the 
eve 
of 
the 
Second 
World 
War, 
the 
economic 
structure 
of 
British 
life 
was 
characterized 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
Great 
Britain 
imported 
about 
£400,000,000 
more 
than 
it 
exported. 
50 
percent 
of 
this 
surplus 
was 
paid 
for 
by 
the 
dividends 
and 
profits 
of 
British-owned 
enterprises 
abroad 
and 
by 
the 
interest 
on 
bonds 
of 
foreign 
countries 
owned 
by 
the 
British. 
The 
standard 
of 
living 
of 
Great 
Britain 
was 
determined 
by 
this 
fact. 
During 
World 
War 
II, 
a 
part 
of 
these 
British 
investments 
abroad 
were 
sold, 
mostly 
to 
the 
United 
States, 
in 
order 
to 
pay 
for 
the 
war 
and 
for 
the 
surplus 
of 
imports 
the 
British 
needed 
before 
Lend-Lease 
started.2 
Then 
after 
the 
war, 
when 
Lend-Lease 
came 
to 
an 
end, 
the 
British 
government 
declared 
that 
it 
was 
no 
longer 
possible 
to 
feed 
their 
people 
without 
the 
aid 
of 
an 
American 
loan 
which 
was, 
in 
fact, 
an 
American 
gift. 
But 
even 
this 
was 
not 
enough. 
The 
Argentine 
government 
expropriated 
the 
shares 
of 
the 
British-owned 
railroad 
and 
paid 
for 
these 
expropriations 
in 
British 
currency. 
The 
British 
government 
then 
taxed 
the 
money 
away 
from 
the 
people 
who 
got 
this 
indemnity 
from 
Argentina, 
and 
used 
this 
money 
to 
pay 
for 
wheat, 
meat, 
and 
other 
foodstuffs 



bought 
from 
Argentina. 
This 
is 
a 
typical 
case 
of 
capital 
consumption. 
Savings 
of 
the 
past 
which 
had 
been 
accumulated 
in 
the 
form 
of 
railroads 
were 
sold 
in 
order 
to 
get 
food 
(current 
consumption). 
This 
is 
very 
characteristic; 
it 
shows 
how 
these 
foreign 
investments 
were 
consumed. 


But 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
European 
foreign 
investments, 
including 
British 
investments 
abroad, 
were 
simply 
expropriated. 
For 
the 
United 
States 
these 
expropriations 
and 
repudiations 
didn’t 
mean 
so 
much, 
because 
the 
United 
States 
is 
comparatively 
very 
rich 
and 
these 
investments 
didn’t 
play 
such 
a 
great 
role 
in 
the 
economy. 
Also, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
the 
United 
States 
is 
still 
accumulating 
additional 
capital. 
But 
for 
Great 
Britain, 
Germany, 
Switzerland, 
France, 
and 
other 
countries, 
this 
meant 
a 
considerable 
reduction 
in 
their 
wealth; 
they 
had 
invested 
abroad, 
not 
because 
they 
wanted 
to 
give 
away 
their 
wealth, 
but 
because 
they 
wanted 
income 
from 
the 
investments. 


There 
are 
many 
different 
methods 
of 
expropriation. 


1. 
The 
communistic 
method: 
If 
the 
country 
goes 
communistic, 
the 
government 
simply 
declares 
that 
there 
is 
no 
longer 
any 
private 
property; 
it 
takes 
and 
it 
doesn’t 
pay 
for 
what 
it 
takes. 
Sometimes 
they 
say 
they 
will 
pay, 
but 
in 
fact 
they 
find 
some 
excuse 
not 
to 
make 
this 
indemnification. 
2. 
Confiscatory 
taxation: 
Of 
course, 
there 
are 
in 
some 
trade 
agreements 
provisions 
prohibiting 
any 
discrimination 
against 
foreigners 
and 
this 
includes 
discrimination 
by 
taxation. 
But 
laws 
can 
be 
written 
so 
as 
not 
to 
appear 
to 
be 
against 
foreigners. 
3. 
Foreign-exchange 
control: 
This 
is 
the 
most 
popular 
method. 
The 
foreign 
corporation 
makes 
a 
profit 
in 
its 
dealings 
in 
a 
country 
but 
the 
foreign-
exchange 
control 
laws 
prevent 
it 
from 
transferring 
these 
profits 
into 
another 
country. 
As 
an 
example, 
let 
us 
consider 
Hungary. 
There 
were 
foreigners 
who 
owned 
small 
or 
greater 
amounts 
of 
bonds 
and 
common 
stocks 
in 
Hungary. 
The 
Hungarian 
government 
said, 
“Of 
course, 
you 
are 
perfectly 
free. 
You 
have 
the 
right 
to 
receive 
your 
interest 
and 
dividends. 
But 
we 
have 
a 
law, 
not 
only 
for 
foreigners, 
also 
for 
Hungarians. 
The 
law 
says 
that 
the 
transfer 
of 
funds 
out 
of 
the 
country 
is 
forbidden. 
Come 
to 
Hungary 
and 
live 
here, 
and 
you 
can 
get 
your 
money.” 
Often 
a 
country 
with 
foreign-exchange 
controls 
does 
not 
even 
let 
a 
man 
spend 
all 
his 
money 
earned 
in 
a 
short 
period 
of 
time 
—it 
is 
portioned 
out 
in 
monthly 
payments. 
In 
effect, 
this 
means 
expropriation. 
What 
they 
really 
want 
is 
for 
the 
producer, 
if 
he 
should 
actually 
come 
to 
the 
country, 
to 
spend 
not 
only 
the 
money 
earned 
in 
the 
country 
but 
also 
his 
own 
money 
which 
he 
brings 
to 
the 
country. 
This 
practically 
means 
an 

end 
to 
foreign 
investment. 
In 
the 
past 
if 
people 
were 
willing 
to 
invest 
capital 
in 
foreign 
countries 
they 
expected 
an 
improvement 
in 
conditions. 
But 
now 
this 
is 
no 
longer 
the 
case. 


In 
the 
Middle 
Ages, 
the 
wealthy 
kings 
and 
rulers 
traveled 
around 
their 
empires. 
They 
said 
they 
were 
judges 
and 
had 
to 
keep 
an 
eye 
on 
the 
country. 
But 
the 
real 
economic 
reason 
for 
their 
travels 
was 
that 
the 
prince, 
the 
German 
Kaiser, 
for 
instance, 
owned 
big 
estates 
in 
various 
parts 
of 
the 
country. 
They 
traveled 
with 
their 
retinue 
to 
consume 
what 
was 
produced 
there. 
It 
was 
easier 
to 
move 
the 
men 
to 
the 
commodities 
than 
to 
move 
the 
commodities 
to 
the 
prince’s 
palace. 
This 
is 
the 
same 
right 
that 
exchange 
controls 
give—to 
consume 
goods 
in 
the 
region 
of 
their 
origin. 


The 
Chinese 
governments 
were 
very 
clever. 
They 
did 
not 
expropriate 
the 
British. 
First, 
they 
prohibited 
them 
from 
exporting 
profits. 
Then 
they 
forced 
them 
to 
operate 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
there 
was 
no 
profit. 
Then 
they 
asked 
for 
taxes 
also, 
so 
that 
the 
British 
had 
to 
send 
additional 
money 
to 
China. 
Finally 
they 
made 
the 
British 
realize 
that 
you 
cannot 
do 
business 
with 
the 
communists, 
you 
especially 
cannot 
invest 
with 
them. 


The 
expropriation 
of 
the 
Mexican 
oil 
fields 
was 
accomplished 
by 
repudiation, 
by 
the 
nonpayment 
of 
bonds. 


The 
story 
of 
foreign 
investment 
can 
be 
told 
in 
a 
few 
words. 
Investments 
went 
out 
but 
only 
the 
glory, 
or 
the 
fame 
of 
this 
glory, 
remains. 
The 
result 
is 
that 
today 
there 
is 
very 
little 
readiness 
of 
people 
to 
invest 
abroad. 


It 
was 
amazing 
that 
during 
the 
interval 
between 
the 
first 
and 
second 
World 
Wars 
there 
were 
still 
investments 
in 
countries 
that 
had 
repudiated 
foreign 
investors 
openly 
or 
indirectly. 
American 
investors 
lost 
a 
lot 
of 
money 
when 
the 
German 
mark 
collapsed 
because 
the 
German 
bonds 
were 
Mark 
bonds, 
not 
gold 
bonds. 
Nevertheless, 
during 
this 
period 
there 
were 
many 
German 
municipalities 
that 
succeeded 
in 
getting 
loans 
from 
American 
investors. 
Sometimes 
these 
America 
investors 
were 
simply 
“babes 
in 
the 
woods”; 
they 
didn’t 
know 
what 
they 
were 
doing. 


The 
Swedish 
government 
issued 
a 
gold 
dollar 
bond. 
They 
were 
paid 
for 
these 
bonds 
in 
gold 
dollars 
and 
promised 
to 
repay 
the 
loan 
in 
American 
gold 
dollars, 
defined 
as 
the 
American 
McKinley 
gold 
dollar. 
Then 
in 
1933, 
the 
United 
States 
went 
off 
the 
gold 
standard. 
The 
provision 
in 
the 
Swedish 
loan 
had 
been 
formulated 
precisely 
for 
the 
unlikely 
event 
of 
a 
change 
in 
the 
American 
currency. 
But 
then 
the 
Swedish 
government 
declared, 
“We 
will 
repay 
the 
loan 
in 
new 
American 
dollars, 
Roosevelt 
dollars, 
not 
in 
McKinley 



dollars 
as 
specified 
in 
the 
bond.” 
Given 
such 
a 
situation 
it 
is 
very 
difficult 
to 
get 
foreign 
investment. 


In 
some 
Latin 
American 
countries 
there 
is 
no 
market 
for 
government 
bonds. 
These 
countries 
got 
private 
loans 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
But 
they 
will 
no 
longer 
get 
such 
loans. 
What 
has 
been 
substituted 
for 
this 
system 
of 
private 
investment 
was, 
first, 
Lend-Lease 
and, 
now, 
foreign 
aid. 
That 
means 
the 
American 
taxpayer 
is 
making 
gifts, 
not 
loans, 
to 
these 
countries. 


Institutions 
have 
been 
established, 
especially 
the 
International 
World 
Bank, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
giving 
loans, 
but 
under 
a 
guarantee. 
In 
the 
long 
run 
such 
a 
system 
is 
self-defeating. 
If 
the 
United 
States 
issues 
bonds 
at 
a 
definite 
rate, 
let 
us 
say 
3 
percent, 
then 
the 
United 
States 
is 
standing 
behind 
the 
bond. 
If 
a 
foreign 
government 
issues 
such 
a 
bond 
under 
the 
guarantee 
of 
the 
United 
States, 
then 
again 
the 
United 
States 
is 
behind 
this 
bond. 
If 
the 
United 
States 
will 
not 
pay, 
then 
this 
foreign 
government 
will 
certainly 
not 
pay 
either. 
Now 
if 
this 
foreign 
loan 
is 
at 
a 
higher 
rate, 
let 
us 
say 
4 
percent, 
then 
the 
American 
government 
competes 
with 
its 
own 
bonds. 
The 
American 
government 
will 
not 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
sell 
its 
own 
bonds 
at 
3 
percent 
if 
the 
foreign 
bond 
has 
an 
advantage 
over 
the 
American 
bonds—not 
only 
a 
higher 
interest 
rate 
but 
the 
guarantee 
of 
the 
American 
government 
besides. 
Therefore, 
such 
a 
system 
cannot 
prevail 
in 
the 
long 
run. 
The 
result 
of 
the 
whole 
thing 
is 
that 
there 
is 
no 
longer 
any 
private 
investment. 


Public 
investment 
abroad 
means 
something 
quite 
different 
from 
private 
investment. 
When 
the 
Argentine 
railroads 
were 
owned 
by 
private 
individuals 
of 
Great 
Britain, 
there 
was 
no 
infringement 
on 
the 
sovereignty 
of 
the 
government 
of 
Argentina. 
But 
if 
the 
railroads 
or 
harbors, 
for 
instance, 
are 
owned 
by 
a 
foreign 
government, 
this 
means 
something 
entirely 
different. 
And 
it 
means 
political 
problems 
become 
more 
important 
than 
economic 
problems. 


Point 
Four 
is 
a 
very 
lame 
attempt 
to 
do 
away 
with 
the 
disastrous 
consequences 
of 
the 
absence 
of 
foreign 
investment.3 
Behind 
it 
is 
the 
idea 
of 
teaching 
these 
backward 
nations 
“know-how.” 
But 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
there 
are 
many 
gifted 
engineers 
with 
“know-how” 
who 
could 
be 
offered 
positions 
abroad 
where 
they 
could 
use 
the 
knowledge 
and 
experience 
they 
have 
acquired 
in 
this 
country. 
Therefore, 
Point 
Four 
is 
not 
necessary 
for 
that 
reason. 
Also, 
there 
are 
hundreds 
and 
even 
thousands 
of 
foreign 
citizens 
in 
the 
United 
States 
and 
in 
Western 
universities 
who 
learn 
all 
these 
things. 
The 
art 
of 
printing 
was 
invented 
500 
years 
ago, 
and 
there 
are 
now 
printed 
textbooks. 
For 
those 
who 
cannot 
read 
English 
there 
are 
translations 
of 
these 
books. 



There 
are 
many 
clever 
Chinese. 
If 
a 
factory 
in 
China 
is 
backward, 
it 
is 
not 
due 
to 
the 
inability 
to 
acquire 
“know-how,” 
but 
because 
it 
doesn’t 
have 
the 
capital 
required. 


In 
1948, 
there 
was 
a 
meeting 
of 
the 
World 
Council 
of 
Churches 
in 
Amsterdam. 
They 
issued 
a 
statement 
saying 
that 
it 
was 
unfair 
and 
unjust 
that 
only 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
West 
enjoyed 
the 
advantages 
of 
machines, 
while 
in 
Asia 
and 
Africa 
the 
methods 
of 
production 
were 
backward. 
If, 
on 
the 
eighth 
day 
of 
Creation, 
the 
Lord 
had 
made 
a 
limited 
amount 
of 
machines 
and 
hospitals 
to 
be 
distributed 
equally 
and 
the 
West 
had 
appropriated 
more 
than 
its 
share, 
then 
one 
could 
have 
said 
that 
the 
situation 
was 
unfair. 
But 
the 
capitalist 
countries 
actually 
gave 
very 
valuable 
equipment 
and 
machines 
as 
gifts 
to 
these 
“backward” 
countries 
and 
the 
“backward” 
countries 
simply 
expropriated 
them. 
These 
countries 
didn’t 
understand 
what 
capitalism 
means. 
They 
thought 
the 
machines 
and 
the 
hospitals 
were 
capitalism. 
But 
capitalism 
is 
the 
mentality 
from 
which 
the 
institutions 
could 
emerge 
making 
it 
possible 
for 
capital 
to 
develop 
in 
the 
West 
and 
then 
to 
construct 
all 
these 
things. 
It 
could 
be 
said 
that 
the 
West 
developed 
its 
method 
of 
production 
from 
capital 
it 
made 
at 
home. 
Capitalism 
is 
not 
things; 
it 
is 
a 
mentality. 


Nehru 
[Jawaharlal 
Nehru, 
1889–1964] 
has 
been 
quoted 
as 
saying: 
“We 
want 
to 
give 
every 
encouragement 
to 
private 
industry. 
We 
won’t 
expropriate 
private 
businesses 
for 
at 
least 
ten 
years—perhaps 
not 
even 
that 
soon.” 
You 
cannot 
expect 
people 
to 
invest 
if 
you 
tell 
them 
that 
you 
will 
expropriate 
them 
at 
some 
time 
in 
the 
future. 
Therefore, 
conditions 
in 
India 
are 
much 
worse 
now 
than 
when 
the 
British 
were 
there. 
Then 
you 
could 
still 
hope 
that 
the 
British 
would 
remain 
and 
that 
they 
would 
not 
expropriate 
your 
business. 
The 
conditions 
are 
again 
similar 
to 
those 
that 
prevailed 
before 
the 
British 
came 
to 
India. 
If 
an 
Indian 
has 
some 
savings, 
he 
invests 
in 
the 
precious 
metals 
or 
still 
better 
in 
jewels. 
First 
of 
all 
these 
cannot 
be 
confiscated 
so 
easily 
and 
you 
can 
try 
to 
hide 
them. 
If 
necessary, 
you 
can 
even 
swallow 
a 
diamond 
to 
keep 
it 
safe 
for 
some 
time. 
You 
can’t 
hide 
a 
railroad 
or 
a 
mine. 
And 
this 
is 
the 
catastrophe 
of 
the 
“backward” 
nations; 
people 
invest 
their 
savings 
in 
such 
things 
rather 
than 
in 
capital 
goods. 


This 
situation 
has 
been 
made 
much 
worse 
because 
the 
Europeans 
brought 
to 
these 
countries 
modern 
medicines 
and 
modern 
methods 
of 
treating 
contagious 
diseases. 
In 
spite 
of 
the 
conditions 
that 
still 
prevail 
in 
China, 
and 
India 
especially, 
infant 
mortality 
figures 
have 
dropped 
considerably. 
As 
a 
result, 
these 
countries 
have 
an 
increasing 
population 
and 
a 
decreasing 
capital 



investment. 
The 
per 
capita 
capital 
is 
dropping 
instead 
of 
increasing. 
The 
Russian 
system 
also 
does 
not 
produce 
capital 
accumulation, 
i.e., 
it 
has 
insufficient 
capital 
accumulation. 
Thus, 
we 
have 
a 
situation 
in 
which 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
mankind 
in 
the 
world 
is 
living 
under 
conditions 
which 
mean 
a 
lowering 
of 
the 
standard 
of 
living. 
It 
is 
terrible 
to 
say 
this, 
but 
it 
is 
true; 
it 
would 
have 
been 
better 
for 
these 
people 
if 
the 
methods 
of 
fighting 
contagious 
diseases 
had 
not 
been 
imported 
for 
them. 


I 
want 
to 
stress 
again 
that 
capitalism, 
modern 
machine 
production, 
and 
so 
on, 
is 
not 
something 
material! 
The 
tools 
and 
machines 
are 
the 
material 
results 
attained 
by 
a 
certain 
spiritual 
mentality, 
by 
a 
certain 
ideology. 
Capitalism 
or 
modern 
conditions, 
modern 
standards 
of 
living, 
are 
not 
simply 
the 
outcome 
of 
technology. 
They 
are 
the 
outcomes 
of 
certain 
ideas 
about 
social 
organization 
and 
about 
the 
cooperation 
of 
men 
under 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
and 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
These 
ideas 
must 
be 
adopted 
in 
these 
“backward” 
countries 
if 
they 
want 
to 
change 
conditions. 


I 
do 
not 
want 
to 
deal 
with 
happiness 
and 
other 
connected 
problems. 
I 
don’t 
want 
to 
say 
that 
the 
Africans 
are 
happy 
without 
machines, 
without 
clothes, 
and 
with 
very 
different 
methods 
of 
feeding. 
But 
certainly 
they 
are 
not 
enthusiastic 
about 
the 
various 
diseases 
that 
plague 
them 
and 
which 
they 
can 
fight 
only 
with 
the 
methods 
of 
modern 
capitalism. 
It 
is 
wonderful 
that 
Dr. 
Albert 
Schweitzer 
[1875–1965] 
went 
to 
the 
center 
of 
Africa 
to 
work 
for 
the 
improvement 
of 
conditions. 
But 
Dr. 
Schweitzer 
has 
had 
only 
a 
very 
limited 
effect 
compared 
to 
the 
effects 
of 
capitalism 
which 
made 
possible 
the 
modern 
means 
of 
production 
that 
provided 
all 
the 
things 
necessary 
to 
maintain 
a 
hospital 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
Africa. 
If 
you 
want 
to 
help 
the 
millions 
in 
Asia 
and 
Africa, 
then 
what 
is 
needed 
is 
capitalistic 
methods 
of 
production 
and 
capitalistic 
ideas. 
And 
they 
cannot 
be 
developed 
by 
the 
means 
which 
are 
today 
being 
applied 
in 
those 
countries. 


It 
was 
the 
introduction 
of 
foreign 
investment 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
that 
helped 
to 
make 
war 
and 
conquest 
superfluous. 
The 
situation 
which 
people 
had 
to 
face 
at 
that 
time, 
and 
are 
facing 
again 
today, 
was 
that 
there 
are 
countries 
in 
the 
world 
which 
nature 
has 
endowed 
with 
natural 
resources 
that 
are 
not 
available 
in 
other 
countries. 
From 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
natural 
resources, 
Europe 
is 
very 
poorly 
endowed 
by 
nature; 
Asia 
is 
much 
better 
endowed. 
If, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
the 
countries 
which 
have 
rich 
natural 
resources 
are 
so 
backward 
and 
so 
poor 
in 
capital 
that 
they 
cannot 
produce 
from 
these 
resources, 
and 
if, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
they 
do 
not 
permit 
foreigners 
to 
invest 



capital 
there 
and 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
these 
resources, 
both 
for 
their 
own 
and 
for 
the 
natives’ 
advantage, 
can 
anyone 
expect 
that 
the 
people 
of 
the 
civilized 
countries 
will 
forever 
tolerate 
this 
state 
of 
affairs? 
Do 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
a 
country, 
just 
because 
their 
ancestors, 
conquered 
the 
country 
500 
or 
600 
years 
ago, 
have 
a 
right 
to 
prevent 
the 
improvement 
of 
conditions 
and 
peace 
in 
the 
world? 


We 
are 
going 
back 
to 
the 
situation 
when 
you 
couldn’t 
get 
these 
products 
without 
conquest, 
the 
situation 
which 
made 
the 
colonial 
system 
necessary. 
The 
nineteenth 
century 
developed 
a 
method 
which 
made 
it 
unnecessary. 
But 
now 
we 
have 
a 
state 
of 
affairs 
again 
in 
which 
these 
countries 
are 
preventing 
access 
by 
trade 
to 
raw 
materials. 
We 
can’t 
know 
but 
some 
day 
a 
new 
technological 
method 
may 
be 
discovered 
that 
depends 
on 
raw 
materials 
which 
are 
available 
only 
in 
very 
backward 
countries. 
The 
people 
will 
say, 
“We 
could 
improve 
our 
standard 
of 
living 
and 
that 
of 
all 
other 
countries 
if 
we 
had 
access 
to 
these 
raw 
materials; 
they 
are 
completely 
useless 
to 
the 
Dalai 
Lama 
of 
Tibet.” 
It 
was 
precisely 
foreign 
investment— 
the 
possibility 
of 
making 
use 
of 
all 
natural 
resources 
without 
political 
interference—that 
made 
war 
unnecessary. 
That 
doesn’t 
hurt 
the 
countries 
involved. 
The 
foreign 
investments 
really 
cooperated 
in 
the 
country’s 
development 
without 
hurting 
the 
country 
in 
any 
way. 
The 
peace 
of 
the 
world 
depends 
on 
this. 


The 
disappearance 
of 
foreign 
investment 
is 
a 
very 
serious 
problem. 
What 
is 
most 
visible 
today 
is 
only 
the 
bad 
consequences, 
the 
bad 
standards 
of 
living, 
in 
India 
and 
China 
and 
some 
other 
countries. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
all; 
the 
whole 
system 
of 
world 
policies 
and 
international 
policies 
will 
be 
affected. 
And 
then 
if 
such 
real 
conflicts 
really 
arise, 
even 
the 
Boy 
Scouts 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
will 
not 
prove 
any 
better 
than 
did 
the 
statutes 
of 
the 
League 
of 
Nations, 
the 
UN’s 
predecessor. 


I 
thank 
you 
for 
the 
patience 
with 
which 
you 
have 
endured 
my 
lectures.

[Additional 
comments 
by 
Mises 
during 
the 
question-and-answer 
period.] 


Lenin 
tried 
to 
get 
foreign 
capital 
to 
invest 
in 
Russia, 
during 
the 
NEP 
period, 
but 
it 
didn’t 
amount 
to 
much. 


Reciprocity 
in 
trade 
agreements 
is 
one 
method 
to 
destroy 
the 
market 
economy. 
The 
principle 
of 
buying 
only 
from 
those 
who 
buy 
from 
you 
ignores 



the 
existence 
of 
money. 
The 
idea 
of 
money, 
the 
use 
of 
money, 
the 
whole 
monetary 
system, 
is 
precisely 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
making 
it 
unnecessary 
for 
you 
to 
buy 
only 
from 
those 
who 
buy 
from 
you. 
Triangular 
trade 
means 
trade 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
money. 
You 
buy 
from 
people 
who 
have 
bought 
from 
others. 
Not 
a 
single 
branch 
of 
business 
in 
this 
country 
could 
exist 
if 
this 
principle 
were 
to 
be 
applied 
here. 


Frontiers 
don’t 
exist 
in 
nature 
or 
in 
economy; 
frontiers 
are 
government-
made 
obstacles. 
Governments 
create 
these 
differences. 


Capitalism 
is 
not 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 
capitalist; 
it 
is 
an 
economic 
system. 
The 
ideas 
of 
the 
individual 
capitalist 
may 
be 
contrary 
in 
many 
regards 
to 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
market 
economy. 
There 
have 
always 
been 
businessmen 
who 
ask 
for 
privileges, 
protection, 
and 
so 
on, 
and 
as 
public 
opinion 
was 
favorable 
to 
these 
things 
they 
got 
them. 
It 
was 
not 
the 
fault 
of 
the 
lobbyists. 
As 
there 
are 
always 
lobbyists 
in 
favor 
of 
some 
things, 
there 
are 
also 
always 
lobbyists 
against 
other 
things. 
It 
is 
not 
even 
necessary 
to 
protect 
infant 
industries; 
there 
are 
shifts 
in 
American 
industry 
without 
such 
protection. 
If 
some 
get 
privileges, 
those 
who 
do 
not 
get 
any 
privileges 
are 
jeopardized. 
If 
the 
non-
privileged 
are 
asking 
for 
privileges 
also, 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
understand. 
The 
duty 
to 
make 
such 
a 
system 
of 
privileges 
disappear 
does 
not 
rest 
with 
the 
businessman 
but 
with 
public 
opinion, 
with 
the 
ideologists, 
statesmen, 
politicians, 
and 
political 
campaigns. 
If 
there 
are 
privileges, 
then 
everybody 
tries 
to 
get 
privileges. 


The 
advantages 
of 
capitalism 
are 
not 
for 
the 
benefit 
and 
advantage 
of 
the 
capitalists, 
but 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
masses. 
Capitalism 
is 
primarily 
production, 
large-scale 
production, 
for 
the 
masses. 
The 
customer, 
who 
is 
always 
right, 
benefits 
from 
capitalism. 
The 
institution 
of 
capitalism 
is 
not 
a 
reward 
for 
good 
children; 
it 
is 
an 
institution 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
nations 
and 
of 
the 
people. 
If 
an 
individual 
capitalist 
is 
bad, 
you 
should 
not 
punish 
him 
by 
abolishing 
capitalism. 
Therefore, 
all 
the 
writers 
and 
authors 
of 
the 
fictional 
stories, 
literature, 
and 
plays 
that 
give 
us 
pictures 
of 
very 
bad 
capitalists, 
and 
say 
capitalism 
should 
be 
abolished, 
miss 
the 
point. 


I 
am 
not 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
market 
economy 
and 
against 
socialism 
because 
capitalists 
are 
very 
nice 
people. 
Some 
are; 
some 
are 
not. 
In 
that 
way 
they 
are 
no 
different 
from 
other 
people. 
I 
am 
for 
capitalism 
because 
it 
benefits 
mankind. 
I 
am 
not 
against 
socialism 
because 
socialists 
are 
bad 
people, 
but 
because 
it 
brings 
about 
a 
complete 
decline 
in 
everyone’s 
standard 
of 
living 
and 
destroys 
freedom.

FOUNDATION 
FOR 
ECONOMIC 
EDUCATION 


Freedom’s 
Home 
Since 
1946 


The 
Foundation 
for 
Economic 
Education 
(FEE), 
the 
oldest 
free-market 
organization 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
was 
established 
in 
1946 
by 
Leonard 
E. 
Read 
to 
study 
and 
advance 
the 
freedom 
philosophy. 
FEE’s 
mission 
is 
to 
offer 
the 
most 
consistent 
case 
for 
the 
first 
principles 
of 
freedom: 
the 
sanctity 
of 
private 
property, 
individual 
liberty, 
the 
rule 
of 
law, 
the 
free 
market, 
and 
the 
moral 
superiority 
of 
individual 
choice 
and 
responsibility 
over 
coercion. 


For 
decades 
these 
ideals 
have 
been 
ignored 
to 
an 
alarming 
degree. 
Despite 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Cold 
War 
and 
the 
demise 
of 
the 
Soviet 
Empire, 
too 
many 
Americans 
do 
not 
seem 
to 
appreciate 
the 
very 
concept 
upon 
which 
the 
Founding 
Fathers 
established 
the 
American 
Republic. 


Our 
vital 
task 
is 
to 
counter 
this 
trend. 
To 
help 
people 
rediscover 
how 
essential 
freedom 
is 
to 
human 
existence 
and 
to 
demonstrate 
how 
dangerous 
it 
is 
to 
move 
toward 
any 
form 
of 
collectivism, 
FEE 
offers 
a 
comprehensive 
educational 
program 
to 
all 
students 
of 
liberty. 


The 
Foundation’s 
periodicals, 
The 
Freeman: 
Ideas 
on 
Liberty 
and 
Notes 
from 
FEE, 
present 
timeless 
insights 
on 
the 
positive 
case 
for 
human 
liberty 
to 
thousands 
of 
people 
around 
the 
world. 
Throughout 
the 
year 
FEE’s 
lecture 
series, 
programs, 
and 
seminars 
bring 
hundreds 
of 
individuals 
of 
all 
ages 
together 
to 
explore 
the 
foundations 
of 
free 
enterprise 
and 
market 
competition. 
The 
Foundation 
plays 
a 
major 
role 
in 
publishing 
and 
promoting 
numerous 
essential 
books 
on 
the 
freedom 
philosophy. 


More 
than 
two 
million 
people 
a 
year 
visit 
our 
state-of-the-art 
website, 
www.fee.org. 
Cybervisitors 
can 
read 
books 
and 
periodicals, 
listen 
to 
speakers, 
take 
a 
virtual 
tour 
of 
the 
Foundation, 
purchase 
books, 
register 
for 
events 
and 
programs, 
and 
much 
more. 
Our 
popular
