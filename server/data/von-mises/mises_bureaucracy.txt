PREFACE 


THE 
main 
issue 
in 
present-day 
social 
and 
political 
conflicts 
is 
whether 
or 
not 
man 
should 
give 
away 
freedom, 
private 
initiative, 
and 
individual 
responsibility 
and 
surrender 
to 
the 
guardianship 
of 
a 
gigantic 
apparatus 
of 
compulsion 
and 
coercion, 
the 
socialist 
state. 
Should 
authoritarian 
totalitarianism 
be 
substituted 
for 
individualism 
and 
democracy? 
Should 
the 
citizen 
be 
transformed 
into 
a 
subject, 
a 
subordinate 
in 
an 
all-embracing 
army 
of 
conscripted 
labor, 
bound 
to 
obey 
unconditionally 
the 
orders 
of 
his 
superiors? 
Should 
he 
be 
deprived 
of 
his 
most 
precious 
privilege 
to 
choose 
means 
and 
ends 
and 
to 
shape 
his 
own 
life? 


Our 
age 
has 
witnessed 
a 
triumphal 
advance 
of 
the 
socialist 
cause. 
As 
much 
as 
half 
a 
century 
ago 
an 
eminent 
British 
statesman, 
Sir 
William 
Harcourt, 
asserted: 
“We 
are 
all 
socialists 
now.”1 
At 
that 
time 
this 
statement 
was 
premature 
as 
far 
as 
Great 
Britain 
was 
concerned, 
but 
today 
it 
is 
almost 
literally 
true 
for 
that 
country, 
once 
the 
cradle 
of 
modern 
liberty. 
It 
is 
no 
less 
true 
with 
regard 
to 
continental 
Europe. 
America 
alone 
is 
still 
free 
to 
choose. 
And 
the 
decision 
of 
the 
American 
people 
will 
determine 
the 
outcome 
for 
the 
whole 
of 
mankind. 


The 
problems 
involved 
in 
the 
antagonism 
between 
socialism 
and 
capitalism 
can 
be 
attacked 
from 
various 
viewpoints. 
At 
present 
it 
seems 
as 
if 
an 
investigation 
of 
the 
expansion 
of 
bureaucratic 
agencies 
is 
the 
most 
expedient 
avenue 
of 
approach. 
An 
analysis 
of 
bureaucratism 
offers 
an 
excellent 
opportunity 
to 
recognize 
the 
fundamental 
problems 
of 
the 
controversy. 


Although 
the 
evolution 
of 
bureaucratism 
has 
been 
very 
rapid 
in 
these 
last 
years, 
America 
is 
still, 
compared 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
world, 
only 
superficially 
afflicted. 
It 
shows 
only 
a 
few 
of 
the 
characteristic 
features 
of 
bureaucratic 
management. 
A 
scrutiny 
of 
bureaucratism 
in 
this 
country 
would 
be 
incomplete 
therefore 
if 
it 
did 
not 
deal 
with 
some 
aspects 
and 
results 
of 
the 
movement 
which 
became 
visible 
only 
in 
countries 
with 
an 
older 
bureaucratic 
tradition. 
Such 
a 
study 
must 
analyze 
the 
experiences 
of 
the 
classical 
countries 
of 
bureaucratism?France, 
Germany, 
and 
Russia. 



However 
it 
is 
not 
the 
object 
of 
such 
occasional 
references 
to 
European 
conditions 
to 
obscure 
the 
radical 
difference 
which 
exists, 
with 
regard 
to 
bureaucratism, 
between 
the 
political 
and 
social 
mentality 
of 
America 
and 
that 
of 
continental 
Europe. 
To 
the 
American 
mind 
the 
notion 
of 
an 
Obrigkeit, 
a 
government 
the 
authority 
of 
which 
is 
not 
derived 
from 
the 
people, 
was 
and 
is 
unknown. 
It 
is 
even 
extremely 
difficult 
to 
explain 
to 
a 
man 
for 
whom 
the 
writings 
of 
Milton 
and 
Paine, 
the 
Declaration 
of 
Independence, 
the 
Constitution 
and 
the 
Gettysburg 
Address 
are 
the 
fountain 
springs 
of 
political 
education, 
what 
this 
German 
term 
Obrigkeit 
implies 
and 
what 
an 
Obrigkeits-
Staat 
is. 
Perhaps 
the 
two 
following 
quotations 
will 
help 
to 
elucidate 
the 
matter. 


On 
January 
15, 
1838, 
the 
Prussian 
Minister 
of 
the 
Interior, 
G. 
A. 
R. 
von 
Rochow, 
declared 
in 
reply 
to 
a 
petition 
of 
citizens 
of 
a 
Prussian 
city: 
“It 
is 
not 
seemly 
for 
a 
subject 
to 
apply 
the 
yardstick 
of 
his 
wretched 
intellect 
to 
the 
acts 
of 
the 
Chief 
of 
the 
State 
and 
to 
arrogate 
to 
himself, 
in 
haughty 
insolence, 
a 
public 
judgment 
about 
their 
fairness.” 
This 
was 
in 
the 
days 
in 
which 
German 
liberalism 
challenged 
absolutism, 
and 
public 
opinion 
vehemently 
resented 
this 
piece 
of 
overbearing 
bureaucratic 
pretension. 


Half 
a 
century 
later 
German 
liberalism 
was 
stone 
dead. 
The 
Kaiser’s 
Sozialpolitik, 
the 
statist 
system 
of 
government 
interference 
with 
business 
and 
of 
aggressive 
nationalism, 
had 
supplanted 
it. 
Nobody 
minded 
when 
the 
Rector 
of 
the 
Imperial 
University 
of 
Strassburg 
quietly 
characterized 
the 
German 
system 
of 
government 
thus: 
“Our 
officials 
… 
will 
never 
tolerate 
anybody’s 
wresting 
the 
power 
from 
their 
hands, 
certainly 
not 
parliamentary 
majorities 
whom 
we 
know 
how 
to 
deal 
with 
in 
a 
masterly 
way. 
No 
kind 
of 
rule 
is 
endured 
so 
easily 
or 
accepted 
so 
gratefully 
as 
that 
of 
high-minded 
and 
highly 
educated 
civil 
servants. 
The 
German 
State 
is 
a 
State 
of 
the 
supremacy 
of 
officialdom?let 
us 
hope 
that 
it 
will 
remain 
so.”2 


Such 
aphorisms 
could 
not 
be 
enunciated 
by 
any 
American. 
It 
could 
not 
happen 
here.

CONCLUSION 



INTRODUCTION 


1. 
THE 
OPPROBRIOUS 
CONNOTATION 
OF 
THE 
TERM 
BUREAUCRACY 
THE 
terms 
bureaucrat, 
bureaucratic, 
and 
bureaucracy 
are 
clearly 
invectives. 
Nobody 
calls 
himself 
a 
bureaucrat 
or 
his 
own 
methods 
of 
management 
bureaucratic. 
These 
words 
are 
always 
applied 
with 
an 
opprobrious 
connotation. 
They 
always 
imply 
a 
disparaging 
criticism 
of 
persons, 
institutions, 
or 
procedures. 
Nobody 
doubts 
that 
bureaucracy 
is 
thoroughly 
bad 
and 
that 
it 
should 
not 
exist 
in 
a 
perfect 
world. 


The 
abusive 
implication 
of 
the 
terms 
in 
question 
is 
not 
limited 
to 
America 
and 
other 
democratic 
countries. 
It 
is 
a 
universal 
phenomenon. 
Even 
in 
Prussia, 
the 
paragon 
of 
authoritarian 
government, 
nobody 
wanted 
to 
be 
called 
a 
bureaucrat. 
The 
Prussian 
king’s 
wirklicher 
geheimer 
Ober-Regierungsrat 
was 
proud 
of 
his 
dignity 
and 
of 
the 
power 
that 
it 
bestowed. 
His 
conceit 
delighted 
in 
the 
reverence 
of 
his 
subordinates 
and 
of 
the 
populace. 
He 
was 
imbued 
with 
the 
idea 
of 
his 
own 
importance 
and 
infallibility. 
But 
he 
would 
have 
deemed 
it 
an 
impudent 
insult 
if 
somebody 
had 
the 
effrontery 
to 
call 
him 
a 
bureaucrat. 
He 
was, 
in 
his 
own 
opinion, 
not 
a 
bureaucrat 
but 
a 
civil 
servant, 
his 
Majesty’s 
mandatory, 
a 
functionary 
of 
the 
State 
unswervingly 
attending 
day 
and 
night 
to 
the 
welfare 
of 
the 
nation. 


It 
is 
noteworthy 
that 
the 
“progressives” 
whom 
the 
critics 
of 
bureaucracy 
make 
responsible 
for 
its 
spread 
do 
not 
venture 
to 
defend 
the 
bureaucratic 
system. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
they 
join 
those 
whom 
they 
in 
other 
respects 
scorn 
as 
“reactionaries” 
in 
condemning 
it. 
For, 
they 
maintain, 
these 
bureaucratic 
methods 
are 
not 
at 
all 
essential 
for 
the 
utopia 
at 
which 
they 
themselves 
are 
aiming. 
Bureaucracy, 
they 
say, 
is 
rather 
the 
unsatisfactory 
way 
in 
which 
the 
capitalist 
system 
tries 
to 
come 
to 
an 
arrangement 
with 
the 
inexorable 
trend 
toward 
its 
own 
disappearance. 
The 
inevitable 
final 
triumph 
of 
socialism 
will 
abolish 
not 
only 
capitalism 
but 
bureaucratism 
also. 
In 
the 
happy 
world 
of 
tomorrow, 
in 
the 
blessed 
paradise 
of 
all-round 
planning, 
there 
will 
no 
longer 



be 
any 
bureaucrats. 
The 
common 
man 
will 
be 
paramount; 
the 
people 
themselves 
will 
take 
care 
of 
all 
their 
affairs. 
Only 
narrow-minded 
bourgeois 
can 
fall 
prey 
to 
the 
error 
that 
bureaucracy 
gives 
a 
foretaste 
of 
what 
socialism 
has 
in 
store 
for 
mankind. 


Thus 
everyone 
seems 
to 
agree 
that 
bureaucracy 
is 
an 
evil. 
But 
it 
is 
no 
less 
true 
that 
nobody 
has 
ever 
tried 
to 
determine 
in 
unambiguous 
language 
what 
bureaucracy 
really 
means. 
The 
word 
is 
generally 
used 
loosely. 
Most 
people 
would 
be 
embarrassed 
if 
somebody 
were 
to 
ask 
them 
for 
a 
precise 
definition 
and 
explanation. 
How 
can 
they 
condemn 
bureaucracy 
and 
bureaucrats 
if 
they 
do 
not 
even 
know 
what 
the 
terms 
mean? 


2. 
THE 
AMERICAN 
CITIZEN’S 
INDICTMENT 
OF 
BUREAUCRATISM 
An 
American, 
asked 
to 
specify 
his 
complaints 
about 
the 
evils 
of 
progressing 
bureaucratization, 
might 
say 
something 
like 
this: 


“Our 
traditional 
American 
system 
of 
government 
was 
based 
on 
the 
separation 
of 
the 
legislative, 
the 
executive, 
and 
the 
judicial 
powers 
and 
on 
a 
fair 
division 
of 
jurisdiction 
between 
the 
Union 
and 
the 
States. 
The 
legislators, 
the 
most 
important 
executives, 
and 
many 
of 
the 
judges 
were 
chosen 
by 
election. 
Thus 
the 
people, 
the 
voters, 
were 
supreme. 
Moreover, 
none 
of 
the 
three 
arms 
of 
the 
government 
had 
the 
right 
to 
interfere 
with 
the 
private 
affairs 
of 
the 
citizens. 
The 
law-abiding 
citizen 
was 
a 
free 
man. 


“But 
now, 
for 
many 
years 
and 
especially 
since 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
New 
Deal, 
powerful 
forces 
are 
on 
the 
point 
of 
substituting 
for 
this 
old 
and 
well-
tried 
democratic 
system 
the 
tyrannical 
rule 
of 
an 
irresponsible 
and 
arbitrary 
bureaucracy. 
The 
bureaucrat 
does 
not 
come 
into 
office 
by 
election 
of 
the 
voters 
but 
by 
appointment 
of 
another 
bureaucrat. 
He 
has 
arrogated 
a 
good 
deal 
of 
the 
legislative 
power. 
Government 
commissions 
and 
bureaus 
issue 
decrees 
and 
regulations 
undertaking 
the 
management 
and 
direction 
of 
every 
aspect 
of 
the 
citizens’ 
lives. 
Not 
only 
do 
they 
regulate 
matters 
which 
hitherto 
have 
been 
left 
to 
the 
discretion 
of 
the 
individual; 
they 
do 
not 
shrink 
from 
decreeing 
what 
is 
virtually 
a 
repeal 
of 
duly 
enacted 
laws. 
By 
means 
of 
this 
quasilegislation 
the 
bureaus 
usurp 
the 
power 
to 
decide 
many 
important 
matters 
according 
to 
their 
own 
judgment 
of 
the 
merits 
of 
each 
case, 
that 
is, 
quite 
arbitrarily. 
The 
rulings 
and 
judgments 
of 
the 
bureaus 
are 
enforced 
by 



Federal 
officials. 
The 
purported 
judicial 
review 
is 
in 
fact 
illusory. 
Every 
day 
the 
bureaucrats 
assume 
more 
power; 
pretty 
soon 
they 
will 
run 
the 
whole 
country. 


“There 
cannot 
be 
any 
doubt 
that 
this 
bureaucratic 
system 
is 
essentially 
antiliberal, 
undemocratic, 
and 
un-American, 
that 
it 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
spirit 
and 
to 
the 
letter 
of 
the 
Constitution, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
a 
replica 
of 
the 
totalitarian 
methods 
of 
Stalin 
and 
Hitler. 
It 
is 
imbued 
with 
a 
fanatical 
hostility 
to 
free 
enterprise 
and 
private 
property. 
It 
paralyzes 
the 
conduct 
of 
business 
and 
lowers 
the 
productivity 
of 
labor. 
By 
heedless 
spending 
it 
squanders 
the 
nation’s 
wealth. 
It 
is 
inefficient 
and 
wasteful. 
Although 
it 
styles 
what 
it 
does 
planning, 
it 
has 
no 
definite 
plans 
and 
aims. 
It 
lacks 
unity 
and 
uniformity; 
the 
various 
bureaus 
and 
agencies 
work 
at 
cross-purposes. 
The 
outcome 
is 
a 
disintegration 
of 
the 
whole 
social 
apparatus 
of 
production 
and 
distribution. 
Poverty 
and 
distress 
are 
bound 
to 
follow.” 


This 
vehement 
indictment 
of 
bureaucracy 
is, 
by 
and 
large, 
an 
adequate 
although 
emotional 
description 
of 
present-day 
trends 
in 
American 
government. 
But 
it 
misses 
the 
point 
as 
it 
makes 
bureaucracy 
and 
the 
bureaucrats 
responsible 
for 
an 
evolution 
the 
causes 
of 
which 
must 
be 
sought 
for 
elsewhere. 
Bureaucracy 
is 
but 
a 
consequence 
and 
a 
symptom 
of 
things 
and 
changes 
much 
more 
deeply 
rooted. 


The 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
present-day 
policies 
is 
the 
trend 
toward 
a 
substitution 
of 
government 
control 
for 
free 
enterprise. 
Powerful 
political 
parties 
and 
pressure 
groups 
are 
fervently 
asking 
for 
public 
control 
of 
all 
economic 
activities, 
for 
thorough 
government 
planning, 
and 
for 
the 
nationalization 
of 
business. 
They 
aim 
at 
full 
government 
control 
of 
education 
and 
at 
the 
socialization 
of 
the 
medical 
profession. 
There 
is 
no 
sphere 
of 
human 
activity 
that 
they 
would 
not 
be 
prepared 
to 
subordinate 
to 
regimentation 
by 
the 
authorities. 
In 
their 
eyes, 
state 
control 
is 
the 
panacea 
for 
all 
ills. 


These 
enthusiastic 
advocates 
of 
government 
omnipotence 
are 
very 
modest 
in 
the 
appraisal 
of 
the 
role 
they 
themselves 
play 
in 
the 
evolution 
toward 
totalitarianism. 
The 
trend 
toward 
socialism, 
they 
contend, 
is 
inevitable. 
It 
is 
the 
necessary 
and 
unavoidable 
tendency 
of 
historical 
evolution. 
With 
Karl 
Marx 
they 
maintain 
that 
socialism 
is 
bound 
to 
come 
“with 
the 
inexorability 
of 



a 
law 
of 
nature.” 
Private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
free 
enterprise, 
capitalism, 
the 
profit 
system 
are 
doomed. 
The 
“wave 
of 
the 
future” 
carries 
men 
toward 
the 
earthly 
paradise 
of 
full 
government 
control. 
The 
champions 
of 
totalitarianism 
call 
themselves 
“progressives” 
precisely 
because 
they 
pretend 
to 
have 
comprehended 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
portents. 
And 
they 
ridicule 
and 
disparage 
as 
“reactionaries” 
all 
those 
who 
try 
to 
resist 
the 
working 
of 
forces 
which?as 
they 
say?no 
human 
effort 
is 
strong 
enough 
to 
stop. 


Because 
of 
these 
“progressive” 
policies 
new 
offices 
and 
government 
agencies 
thrive 
like 
mushrooms. 
The 
bureaucrats 
multiply 
and 
are 
anxious 
to 
restrict, 
step 
by 
step, 
the 
individual 
citizen’s 
freedom 
to 
act. 
Many 
citizens, 
i.e., 
those 
whom 
the 
“progressives” 
scorn 
as 
“reactionaries,” 
resent 
this 
encroachment 
upon 
their 
affairs, 
and 
blame 
the 
incompetence 
and 
wastefulness 
of 
the 
bureaucrats. 
But 
these 
opponents 
have 
hitherto 
been 
only 
a 
minority. 
The 
proof 
is 
that, 
in 
the 
past 
elections, 
they 
were 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
poll 
a 
majority 
of 
the 
votes. 
The 
“progressives,” 
the 
adamant 
foes 
of 
free 
enterprise 
and 
private 
initiative 
and 
fanatical 
champions 
of 
totalitarian 
government 
control 
of 
business, 
defeated 
them. 


It 
is 
a 
fact 
that 
the 
policy 
of 
the 
New 
Deal 
has 
been 
supported 
by 
the 
voters. 
Nor 
is 
there 
any 
doubt 
that 
this 
policy 
will 
be 
entirely 
abandoned 
if 
the 
voters 
withdraw 
their 
favor 
from 
it. 
The 
United 
States 
is 
still 
a 
democracy. 
The 
Constitution 
is 
still 
intact. 
Elections 
are 
still 
free. 
The 
voters 
do 
not 
cast 
their 
ballot 
under 
duress. 
It 
is 
therefore 
not 
correct 
to 
say 
that 
the 
bureaucratic 
system 
carried 
its 
victory 
by 
unconstitutional 
and 
undemocratic 
methods. 
The 
lawyers 
may 
be 
right 
in 
questioning 
the 
legality 
of 
some 
minor 
points. 
But 
as 
a 
whole 
the 
New 
Deal 
was 
backed 
by 
Congress. 
Congress 
made 
the 
laws 
and 
appropriated 
the 
money. 


Of 
course, 
America 
is 
faced 
with 
a 
phenomenon 
that 
the 
framers 
of 
the 
Constitution 
did 
not 
foresee 
and 
could 
not 
foresee: 
the 
voluntary 
abandonment 
of 
congressional 
rights. 
Congress 
has 
in 
many 
instances 
surrendered 
the 
function 
of 
legislation 
to 
government 
agencies 
and 
commissions, 
and 
it 
has 
relaxed 
its 
budgetary 
control 
through 
the 
allocation 
of 
large 
appropriations 
for 
expenditures, 
which 
the 
Administration 
has 
to 
determine 
in 
detail. 
The 
right 
of 
Congress 
to 
delegate 
some 
of 
its 
powers 



temporarily 
is 
not 
uncontested. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
National 
Recovery 
Administration 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
declared 
it 
unconstitutional. 
But 
delegations 
of 
power 
formulated 
in 
a 
more 
cautious 
way 
are 
an 
almost 
regular 
practice. 
At 
any 
rate, 
Congress, 
in 
acting 
this 
way, 
has 
hitherto 
not 
been 
at 
variance 
with 
the 
declared 
will 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
sovereign 
people. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
we 
must 
realize 
that 
delegation 
of 
power 
is 
the 
main 
instrument 
of 
modern 
dictatorship. 
It 
is 
by 
virtue 
of 
delegation 
of 
power 
that 
Hitler 
and 
his 
Cabinet 
rule 
Germany. 
It 
is 
by 
delegation 
of 
power 
that 
the 
British 
Left 
wants 
to 
establish 
its 
dictatorship 
and 
to 
transform 
Great 
Britain 
into 
a 
socialist 
commonwealth. 
It 
is 
obvious 
that 
delegation 
of 
power 
can 
be 
used 
as 
a 
quasiconstitutional 
disguise 
for 
a 
dictatorship. 
But 
this 
is 
certainly 
not 
the 
case 
at 
present 
in 
this 
country. 
Congress 
has 
undoubtedly 
still 
the 
legal 
right 
and 
the 
actual 
might 
to 
take 
back 
all 
the 
power 
it 
has 
delegated. 
The 
voters 
still 
have 
the 
right 
and 
the 
power 
to 
return 
senators 
and 
representatives 
who 
are 
radically 
opposed 
to 
any 
abandonment 
of 
congressional 
powers. 
In 
the 
United 
States 
bureaucracy 
is 
based 
on 
constitutional 
grounds. 


Nor 
is 
it 
correct 
to 
deem 
as 
unconstitutional 
the 
progressing 
concentration 
of 
jurisdictional 
powers 
in 
the 
central 
government 
and 
the 
resulting 
diminution 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
States. 
Washington 
has 
not 
openly 
usurped 
any 
constitutional 
powers 
of 
the 
States. 
The 
equilibrium 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
powers 
between 
the 
Federal 
Government 
and 
the 
States 
as 
established 
by 
the 
Constitution 
has 
been 
seriously 
disturbed 
because 
the 
new 
powers 
that 
the 
authorities 
acquired 
for 
the 
most 
part 
accrued 
to 
the 
Union 
and 
not 
to 
the 
States. 
This 
is 
not 
the 
effect 
of 
sinister 
machinations 
on 
the 
part 
of 
mysterious 
Washington 
cliques, 
eager 
to 
curb 
the 
States 
and 
to 
establish 
centralization. 
It 
is 
the 
consequence 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
United 
States 
is 
an 
economic 
unit 
with 
a 
uniform 
monetary 
and 
credit 
system 
and 
with 
free 
mobility 
of 
commodities, 
capital, 
and 
men 
among 
the 
States. 
In 
such 
a 
country 
government 
control 
of 
business 
must 
be 
centralized. 
It 
would 
be 
out 
of 
the 
question 
to 
leave 
it 
to 
the 
individual 
States. 
If 
each 
State 
were 
free 
to 
control 
business 
according 
to 
its 
own 
plans, 
the 
unity 
of 
the 
domestic 
market 
would 
disintegrate. 
State 
control 
of 
business 
would 
be 
practicable 
only 
if 
every 
State 
were 
in 
a 
position 
to 
separate 
its 
territory 
from 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
nation 
by 
trade 
and 
migration 
barriers 
and 
an 
autonomous 
monetary 
and 
credit 
policy. 
As 
nobody 
seriously 



suggests 
breaking 
up 
the 
economic 
unity 
of 
the 
nation, 
it 
has 
been 
necessary 
to 
entrust 
the 
control 
of 
business 
to 
the 
Union. 
It 
is 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
system 
of 
government 
control 
of 
business 
to 
aim 
at 
the 
utmost 
centralization. 
The 
autonomy 
of 
the 
States 
as 
guaranteed 
by 
the 
Constitution 
is 
realizable 
only 
under 
a 
system 
of 
free 
enterprise. 
In 
voting 
for 
government 
control 
of 
business 
the 
voters 
implicitly, 
although 
unwittingly, 
are 
voting 
for 
more 
centralization. 


Those 
who 
criticize 
bureaucracy 
make 
the 
mistake 
of 
directing 
their 
attacks 
against 
a 
symptom 
only 
and 
not 
against 
the 
seat 
of 
the 
evil. 
It 
makes 
no 
difference 
whether 
the 
innumerable 
decrees 
regimenting 
every 
aspect 
of 
the 
citizen’s 
economic 
activities 
are 
issued 
directly 
by 
a 
law, 
duly 
passed 
by 
Congress, 
or 
by 
a 
commission 
or 
government 
agency 
to 
which 
power 
has 
been 
given 
by 
a 
law 
and 
by 
the 
allocation 
of 
money. 
What 
people 
are 
really 
complaining 
about 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
government 
has 
embarked 
upon 
such 
totalitarian 
policies, 
not 
the 
technical 
procedures 
applied 
in 
their 
establishment. 
It 
would 
make 
little 
difference 
if 
Congress 
had 
not 
endowed 
these 
agencies 
with 
quasilegislative 
functions 
and 
had 
reserved 
to 
itself 
the 
right 
to 
issue 
all 
decrees 
required 
for 
the 
conduct 
of 
their 
functions. 


Once 
price 
control 
is 
declared 
a 
task 
of 
government, 
an 
indefinite 
number 
of 
price 
ceilings 
must 
be 
fixed 
and 
many 
of 
them 
must, 
with 
changing 
conditions, 
be 
altered 
again 
and 
again. 
This 
power 
is 
vested 
in 
the 
Office 
of 
Price 
Administration. 
But 
the 
sway 
of 
its 
bureaucrats 
would 
not 
be 
impaired 
substantially 
if 
they 
were 
under 
the 
necessity 
of 
approaching 
Congress 
for 
legislating 
such 
ceilings. 
Congress 
would 
be 
flooded 
by 
a 
multitude 
of 
bills 
the 
content 
of 
which 
would 
extend 
beyond 
the 
range 
of 
its 
competence. 
The 
members 
of 
Congress 
would 
lack 
both 
the 
time 
and 
the 
information 
to 
examine 
seriously 
the 
proposals 
elaborated 
by 
the 
various 
subdivisions 
of 
the 
OPA. 
No 
choice 
would 
be 
left 
to 
them 
other 
than 
trusting 
the 
chief 
of 
the 
office 
and 
its 
employees 
and 
voting 
en 
bloc 
for 
the 
bills 
or 
repealing 
the 
law 
giving 
the 
Administration 
the 
power 
to 
control 
prices. 
It 
would 
be 
out 
of 
the 
question 
for 
the 
members 
of 
Congress 
to 
look 
into 
the 
matter 
with 
the 
same 
conscientiousness 
and 
scrupulousness 
they 
ordinarily 
apply 
in 
deliberating 
about 
policies 
and 
laws. 


Parliamentary 
procedures 
are 
an 
adequate 
method 
for 
dealing 
with 
the 



framing 
of 
laws 
needed 
by 
a 
community 
based 
on 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
free 
enterprise, 
and 
consumers’ 
sovereignty. 
They 
are 
essentially 
inappropriate 
for 
the 
conduct 
of 
affairs 
under 
government 
omnipotence. 
The 
makers 
of 
the 
Constitution 
never 
dreamed 
of 
a 
system 
of 
government 
under 
which 
the 
authorities 
would 
have 
to 
determine 
the 
prices 
of 
pepper 
and 
of 
oranges, 
of 
photographic 
cameras 
and 
of 
razor 
blades, 
of 
neckties 
and 
of 
paper 
napkins. 
But 
if 
such 
a 
contingency 
had 
occurred 
to 
them, 
they 
surely 
would 
have 
considered 
as 
insignificant 
the 
question 
whether 
such 
regulations 
should 
be 
issued 
by 
Congress 
or 
by 
a 
bureaucratic 
agency. 
They 
would 
have 
easily 
understood 
that 
government 
control 
of 
business 
is 
ultimately 
incompatible 
with 
any 
form 
of 
constitutional 
and 
democratic 
government. 


It 
is 
not 
an 
accident 
that 
socialist 
countries 
are 
ruled 
in 
a 
dictatorial 
way. 
Totalitarianism 
and 
government 
by 
the 
people 
are 
irreconcilable. 
Things 
in 
Germany 
and 
Russia 
would 
not 
be 
different 
if 
Hitler 
and 
Stalin 
were 
to 
submit 
all 
their 
decrees 
to 
the 
decision 
of 
their 
“parliaments.” 
Under 
government 
control 
of 
business 
parliaments 
cannot 
be 
anything 
else 
than 
assemblies 
of 
yes 
men. 


Neither 
is 
it 
justifiable 
to 
find 
fault 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
offices 
of 
the 
bureaucratic 
administrators 
are 
not 
elective. 
Election 
of 
executives 
is 
reasonable 
only 
in 
the 
case 
of 
top 
executives. 
Here 
the 
voters 
have 
to 
choose 
among 
candidates 
whose 
political 
character 
and 
convictions 
they 
know. 
It 
would 
be 
absurd 
to 
use 
the 
same 
method 
for 
the 
appointment 
of 
a 
host 
of 
unknown 
people. 
It 
makes 
sense 
if 
the 
citizens 
vote 
for 
President, 
for 
Governor, 
or 
for 
Mayor. 
It 
would 
be 
nonsensical 
to 
let 
them 
vote 
for 
the 
hundreds 
and 
thousands 
of 
minor 
clerks. 
In 
such 
elections 
the 
voters 
would 
have 
no 
choice 
but 
to 
endorse 
the 
list 
proposed 
by 
their 
party. 
It 
makes 
no 
material 
difference 
whether 
the 
duly 
elected 
President 
or 
Governor 
nominates 
all 
his 
aides 
or 
whether 
the 
voters 
vote 
for 
a 
list 
containing 
the 
names 
of 
all 
those 
men 
whom 
their 
preferred 
candidate 
has 
chosen 
as 
aides. 


It 
is 
quite 
correct, 
as 
the 
opponents 
of 
the 
trend 
toward 
totalitarianism 
say, 
that 
the 
bureaucrats 
are 
free 
to 
decide 
according 
to 
their 
own 
discretion 
questions 
of 
vital 
importance 
for 
the 
individual 
citizen’s 
life. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
officeholders 
are 
no 
longer 
the 
servants 
of 
the 
citizenry 
but 
irresponsible 
and 



arbitrary 
masters 
and 
tyrants. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
the 
fault 
of 
bureaucracy. 
It 
is 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
new 
system 
of 
government 
which 
restricts 
the 
individual’s 
freedom 
to 
manage 
his 
own 
affairs 
and 
assigns 
more 
and 
more 
tasks 
to 
the 
government. 
The 
culprit 
is 
not 
the 
bureaucrat 
but 
the 
political 
system. 
And 
the 
sovereign 
people 
is 
still 
free 
to 
discard 
this 
system. 


It 
is 
further 
true 
that 
bureaucracy 
is 
imbued 
with 
an 
implacable 
hatred 
of 
private 
business 
and 
free 
enterprise. 
But 
the 
supporters 
of 
the 
system 
consider 
precisely 
this 
the 
most 
laudable 
feature 
of 
their 
attitude. 
Far 
from 
being 
ashamed 
of 
their 
anti-business 
policies, 
they 
are 
proud 
of 
them. 
They 
aim 
at 
full 
control 
of 
business 
by 
the 
government 
and 
see 
in 
every 
businessman 
who 
wants 
to 
evade 
this 
control 
a 
public 
enemy. 


Finally 
it 
is 
true 
that 
the 
new 
policy, 
although 
not 
unconstitutional 
from 
a 
merely 
formalistic 
viewpoint, 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
Constitution, 
that 
it 
is 
tantamount 
to 
an 
overthrow 
of 
all 
that 
was 
precious 
to 
the 
older 
generations 
of 
Americans, 
that 
it 
must 
result 
in 
an 
abandonment 
of 
what 
people 
used 
to 
call 
democracy, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
in 
this 
sense 
un-American. 
But 
this 
reproach 
too 
does 
not 
discredit 
the 
“progressive” 
tendencies 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
their 
supporters. 
They 
look 
at 
the 
past 
with 
other 
eyes 
than 
their 
critics’. 
For 
them 
the 
history 
of 
all 
hitherto 
existing 
society 
is 
a 
record 
of 
human 
degradation, 
misery, 
and 
ruthless 
exploitation 
of 
the 
masses 
by 
ruling 
classes. 
What 
is 
called 
“individualism” 
in 
the 
American 
language 
is, 
they 
say, 
“a 
high-sounding 
term 
for 
money 
greed 
transfigured 
and 
parading 
as 
a 
virtue.” 
The 
idea 
was 
“to 
give 
a 
free 
hand 
to 
money-getters, 
sharp-witted 
tricksters, 
stock 
manipulators 
and 
other 
bandits 
who 
lived 
by 
raids 
on 
the 
national 
income.”1 
The 
American 
system 
is 
scorned 
as 
a 
spurious 
“bill-of-rights 
democracy,” 
and 
the 
Russian 
system 
of 
Stalin 
is 
extravagantly 
praised 
as 
the 
only 
truly 
democratic 
one. 


The 
main 
issue 
in 
present-day 
political 
struggles 
is 
whether 
society 
should 
be 
organized 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
(capitalism, 
the 
market 
system) 
or 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
public 
control 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
(socialism, 
communism, 
planned 
economy). 
Capitalism 
means 
free 
enterprise, 
sovereignty 
of 
the 
consumers 
in 
economic 
matters, 
and 
sovereignty 
of 
the 
voters 
in 
political 
matters. 
Socialism 
means 
full 
government 
control 
of 
every 
sphere 
of 
the 
individual’s 
life 
and 
the 



unrestricted 
supremacy 
of 
the 
government 
in 
its 
capacity 
as 
central 
board 
of 
production 
management. 
There 
is 
no 
compromise 
possible 
between 
these 
two 
systems. 
Contrary 
to 
a 
popular 
fallacy 
there 
is 
no 
middle 
way, 
no 
third 
system 
possible 
as 
a 
pattern 
of 
a 
permanent 
social 
order.2 
The 
citizens 
must 
choose 
between 
capitalism 
and 
socialism 
or, 
as 
many 
Americans 
say, 
between 
the 
American 
and 
the 
Russian 
way 
of 
life. 


Whoever 
in 
this 
antagonism 
sides 
with 
capitalism 
must 
do 
it 
frankly 
and 
directly. 
He 
must 
give 
positive 
support 
to 
private 
property 
and 
free 
enterprise. 
It 
is 
vain 
to 
content 
oneself 
with 
attacks 
on 
some 
measures 
designed 
to 
pave 
the 
way 
for 
socialism. 
It 
is 
useless 
to 
fight 
mere 
attendant 
phenomena 
and 
not 
the 
tendency 
toward 
totalitarianism 
as 
such. 
It 
is 
idle 
to 
dwell 
on 
a 
criticism 
of 
bureaucratism 
only. 


3. 
THE 
“PROGRESSIVES’” 
VIEW 
OF 
BUREAUCRATISM 
The 
“progressive” 
critics 
of 
bureaucratism 
direct 
their 
attacks 
primarily 
against 
the 
bureaucratization 
of 
corporate 
big 
business. 
Their 
reasoning 
runs 
this 
way: 


“In 
the 
past 
business 
firms 
were 
comparatively 
small. 
The 
entrepreneur 
was 
in 
a 
position 
to 
survey 
all 
parts 
of 
his 
enterprise 
and 
to 
make 
all 
important 
decisions 
personally. 
He 
was 
the 
owner 
of 
all 
the 
capital 
invested 
or 
at 
least 
of 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
it. 
He 
was 
himself 
vitally 
interested 
in 
the 
success 
of 
his 
enterprise. 
He 
was 
therefore 
to 
the 
best 
of 
his 
abilities 
intent 
on 
making 
his 
outfit 
as 
efficient 
as 
possible 
and 
on 
avoiding 
waste. 


“But 
with 
the 
inexorable 
trend 
toward 
economic 
concentration, 
conditions 
changed 
radically. 
Today 
the 
scene 
is 
dominated 
by 
corporate 
big 
business. 
It 
is 
absentee 
ownership; 
the 
legal 
owners, 
the 
stockholders, 
have 
no 
actual 
voice 
in 
the 
management. 
This 
task 
is 
left 
to 
professional 
administrators. 
The 
enterprises 
are 
so 
large 
that 
functions 
and 
activities 
must 
be 
distributed 
among 
departments 
and 
administrative 
subdivisions. 
The 
conduct 
of 
affairs 
necessarily 
becomes 
bureaucratic. 


“The 
present-day 
champions 
of 
free 
enterprise 
are 
romantics 
like 
the 
eulogists 
of 
the 
medieval 
arts 
and 
crafts. 
They 
are 
entirely 
mistaken 
in 
attributing 
to 
mammoth 
corporations 
the 
qualities 
which 
once 
were 
the 



excellence 
of 
small 
or 
medium-size 
business. 
There 
cannot 
be 
any 
question 
of 
breaking 
up 
the 
big 
aggregates 
into 
smaller 
units. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
tendency 
toward 
a 
further 
concentration 
of 
economic 
power 
will 
prevail. 
Monopolized 
big 
business 
will 
congeal 
into 
rigid 
bureaucratism. 
Its 
managers, 
responsible 
to 
nobody, 
will 
become 
a 
hereditary 
aristocracy; 
the 
governments 
will 
become 
mere 
puppets 
of 
an 
omnipotent 
business 
clique. 


“It 
is 
indispensable 
to 
curb 
the 
power 
of 
this 
managerial 
oligarchy 
by 
government 
action. 
The 
complaints 
about 
government 
regimentation 
are 
unfounded. 
As 
things 
are, 
there 
is 
only 
the 
choice 
between 
the 
rule 
of 
an 
irresponsible 
managerial 
bureaucracy 
and 
that 
of 
the 
nation’s 
government.” 


The 
apologetic 
character 
of 
such 
reasoning 
is 
obvious. 
To 
the 
general 
criticism 
of 
the 
spread 
of 
governmental 
bureaucratism 
the 
“progressives” 
and 
New 
Dealers 
reply 
that 
bureaucracy 
is 
not 
at 
all 
limited 
to 
government. 
It 
is 
a 
universal 
phenomenon 
present 
both 
in 
business 
and 
in 
government. 
Its 
broadest 
cause 
is 
“the 
tremendous 
size 
of 
the 
organization.”3 
It 
is 
therefore 
an 
inescapable 
evil. 


This 
book 
will 
try 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
no 
profit-seeking 
enterprise, 
no 
matter 
how 
large, 
is 
liable 
to 
become 
bureaucratic 
provided 
the 
hands 
of 
its 
management 
are 
not 
tied 
by 
government 
interference. 
The 
trend 
toward 
bureaucratic 
rigidity 
is 
not 
inherent 
in 
the 
evolution 
of 
business. 
It 
is 
an 
outcome 
of 
government 
meddling 
with 
business. 
It 
is 
a 
result 
of 
the 
policies 
designed 
to 
eliminate 
the 
profit 
motive 
from 
its 
role 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
society’s 
economic 
organization. 


In 
these 
introductory 
remarks 
we 
want 
to 
dwell 
only 
upon 
one 
point 
of 
the 
popular 
complaints 
about 
the 
growing 
bureaucratization 
of 
business. 
Bureaucratization, 
people 
say, 
is 
caused 
by 
“the 
lack 
of 
competent, 
effective 
leadership.”4 
What 
is 
wanting 
is 
“creative 
leadership.” 


To 
complain 
of 
lack 
of 
leadership 
is, 
in 
the 
field 
of 
political 
affairs, 
the 
characteristic 
attitude 
of 
all 
harbingers 
of 
dictatorship. 
In 
their 
eyes 
the 
main 
deficiency 
of 
democratic 
government 
is 
that 
it 
is 
unable 
to 
produce 
great 
Führers 
and 
Duces. 


In 
the 
field 
of 
business 
creative 
leadership 
manifests 
itself 
in 
the 
adjustment 



of 
production 
and 
distribution 
to 
the 
changing 
conditions 
of 
demand 
and 
supply 
and 
in 
the 
adaptation 
of 
technical 
improvements 
to 
practical 
uses. 
The 
great 
businessman 
is 
he 
who 
produces 
more, 
better, 
and 
cheaper 
goods, 
who, 
as 
a 
pioneer 
of 
progress, 
presents 
his 
fellow 
men 
with 
commodities 
and 
services 
hitherto 
unknown 
to 
them 
or 
beyond 
their 
means. 
We 
may 
call 
him 
a 
leader 
because 
his 
initiative 
and 
activity 
force 
his 
competitors 
either 
to 
emulate 
his 
achievements 
or 
to 
go 
out 
of 
business. 
It 
is 
his 
indefatigable 
inventiveness 
and 
fondness 
for 
innovations 
that 
prevents 
all 
business 
units 
from 
degenerating 
into 
idle 
bureaucratic 
routine. 
He 
embodies 
in 
his 
person 
the 
restless 
dynamism 
and 
progressivism 
inherent 
in 
capitalism 
and 
free 
enterprise. 


It 
would 
certainly 
be 
an 
exaggeration 
to 
say 
that 
such 
creative 
leaders 
are 
lacking 
in 
present-day 
America. 
Many 
of 
the 
old 
heroes 
of 
American 
business 
are 
still 
alive 
and 
active 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
their 
affairs. 
It 
would 
be 
a 
delicate 
matter 
to 
express 
an 
opinion 
about 
the 
creativeness 
of 
younger 
men. 
Some 
temporal 
distance 
is 
needed 
for 
a 
correct 
appreciation 
of 
their 
achievements. 
A 
true 
genius 
is 
very 
rarely 
acknowledged 
as 
such 
by 
his 
contemporaries. 


Society 
cannot 
contribute 
anything 
to 
the 
breeding 
and 
growing 
of 
ingenious 
men. 
A 
creative 
genius 
cannot 
be 
trained. 
There 
are 
no 
schools 
for 
creativeness. 
A 
genius 
is 
precisely 
a 
man 
who 
defies 
all 
schools 
and 
rules, 
who 
deviates 
from 
the 
traditional 
roads 
of 
routine 
and 
opens 
up 
new 
paths 
through 
land 
inaccessible 
before. 
A 
genius 
is 
always 
a 
teacher, 
never 
a 
pupil; 
he 
is 
always 
self-made. 
He 
does 
not 
owe 
anything 
to 
the 
favor 
of 
those 
in 
power. 
But, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
government 
can 
bring 
about 
conditions 
which 
paralyze 
the 
efforts 
of 
a 
creative 
spirit 
and 
prevent 
him 
from 
rendering 
useful 
services 
to 
the 
community. 


This 
is 
the 
case 
today 
in 
the 
field 
of 
business. 
Let 
us 
look 
at 
one 
instance 
only, 
the 
income 
tax. 
In 
the 
past 
an 
ingenious 
newcomer 
started 
a 
new 
project. 
It 
was 
a 
modest 
start; 
he 
was 
poor, 
his 
funds 
were 
small 
and 
most 
of 
them 
borrowed. 
When 
initial 
success 
came, 
he 
did 
not 
increase 
his 
consumption, 
but 
reinvested 
the 
much 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
profits. 
Thus 
his 
business 
grew 
quickly. 
He 
became 
a 
leader 
in 
his 
line. 
His 
threatening 
competition 
forced 
the 
old 
rich 
firms 
and 
the 
big 
corporations 
to 
adjust 
their 



management 
to 
the 
conditions 
brought 
about 
by 
his 
intervention. 
They 
could 
not 
disregard 
him 
and 
indulge 
in 
bureaucratic 
negligence. 
They 
were 
under 
the 
necessity 
of 
being 
on 
their 
guard 
day 
and 
night 
against 
such 
dangerous 
innovators. 
If 
they 
could 
not 
find 
a 
man 
able 
to 
rival 
the 
newcomer 
for 
the 
management 
of 
their 
own 
affairs, 
they 
had 
to 
merge 
their 
own 
business 
with 
his 
and 
yield 
to 
his 
leadership. 


But 
today 
the 
income 
tax 
absorbs 
80 
or 
more 
per 
cent 
of 
such 
a 
newcomer’s 
initial 
profits. 
He 
cannot 
accumulate 
capital; 
he 
cannot 
expand 
his 
business; 
his 
enterprise 
will 
never 
become 
big 
business. 
He 
is 
no 
match 
for 
the 
old 
vested 
interests. 
The 
old 
firms 
and 
corporations 
already 
own 
a 
considerable 
capital. 
Income 
and 
corporation 
taxes 
prevent 
them 
from 
accumulating 
more 
capital, 
while 
they 
prevent 
the 
newcomer 
from 
accumulating 
any 
capital. 
He 
is 
doomed 
to 
remain 
small 
business 
forever. 
The 
already 
existing 
enterprises 
are 
sheltered 
against 
the 
dangers 
from 
ingenious 
newcomers. 
They 
are 
not 
menaced 
by 
their 
competition. 
They 
enjoy 
a 
virtual 
privilege 
as 
far 
as 
they 
content 
themselves 
with 
keeping 
their 
business 
in 
the 
traditional 
lines 
and 
in 
the 
traditional 
size.5 
Their 
further 
development, 
of 
course, 
is 
curtailed. 
The 
continuous 
drain 
on 
their 
profits 
by 
taxes 
makes 
it 
impossible 
for 
them 
to 
expand 
their 
business 
out 
of 
their 
own 
funds. 
Thus 
a 
tendency 
toward 
rigidity 
originates. 


In 
all 
countries 
all 
tax 
laws 
are 
today 
written 
as 
if 
the 
main 
purpose 
of 
taxes 
were 
to 
hinder 
the 
accumulation 
of 
new 
capital 
and 
the 
improvements 
which 
it 
could 
achieve. 
The 
same 
tendency 
manifests 
itself 
in 
many 
other 
branches 
of 
public 
policy. 
The 
“progressives” 
are 
badly 
off 
the 
mark 
when 
they 
complain 
about 
the 
lack 
of 
creative 
business 
leadership. 
Not 
the 
men 
are 
lacking 
but 
the 
institutions 
which 
would 
permit 
them 
to 
utilize 
their 
gifts. 
Modern 
policies 
result 
in 
tying 
the 
hands 
of 
innovators 
no 
less 
than 
did 
the 
guild 
system 
of 
the 
Middle 
Ages. 



4. 
BUREAUCRATISM 
AND 
TOTALITARIANISM 
It 
will 
be 
shown 
in 
this 
book 
that 
bureaucracy 
and 
bureaucratic 
methods 
are 
very 
old 
and 
that 
they 
must 
be 
present 
in 
the 
administrative 
apparatus 
of 
every 
government 
the 
sovereignty 
of 
which 
stretches 
over 
a 
large 
area. 
The 
Pharaohs 
of 
ancient 
Egypt 
and 
the 
emperors 
of 
China 
built 
a 
huge 
bureaucratic 
machine 
and 
so 
did 
all 
the 
other 
rulers. 
Medieval 
feudalism 
was 
an 
attempt 
to 
organize 
the 
government 
of 
large 
territories 
without 
bureaucrats 
and 
bureaucratic 
methods. 
It 
failed 
utterly 
in 
these 
endeavors. 
It 
resulted 
in 
a 
complete 
disintegration 
of 
political 
unity 
and 
in 
anarchy. 
The 
feudal 
lords, 
originally 
officeholders 
only 
and 
as 
such 
subject 
to 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
central 
government, 
became 
virtually 
independent 
princes, 
fighting 
one 
another 
almost 
continually 
and 
defying 
the 
king, 
the 
courts, 
and 
the 
laws. 
From 
the 
fifteenth 
century 
on 
curbing 
the 
arrogance 
of 
the 
vassals 
was 
the 
main 
task 
of 
the 
various 
European 
kings. 
The 
modern 
state 
is 
built 
upon 
the 
ruins 
of 
feudalism. 
It 
substituted 
bureaucratic 
management 
of 
public 
affairs 
for 
the 
supremacy 
of 
a 
multitude 
of 
petty 
princes 
and 
counts. 


Far 
ahead 
in 
this 
evolution 
were 
the 
kings 
of 
France. 
Alexis 
de 
Tocqueville 
has 
shown 
how 
the 
Bourbon 
kings 
unswervingly 
aimed 
at 
the 
abolition 
of 
the 
autonomy 
of 
powerful 
vassals 
and 
of 
oligarchic 
groups 
of 
aristocrats. 
In 
this 
regard 
the 
French 
Revolution 
only 
achieved 
what 
the 
absolute 
kings 
themselves 
had 
begun. 
It 
eliminated 
the 
arbitrariness 
of 
the 
kings, 
it 
made 
the 
law 
supreme 
in 
the 
field 
of 
administration 
and 
restricted 
the 
scope 
of 
affairs 
subject 
to 
the 
discretionary 
judgment 
of 
the 
officeholders. 
It 
did 
not 
brush 
away 
bureaucratic 
management; 
it 
only 
put 
it 
on 
a 
legal 
and 
constitutional 
basis. 
France’s 
nineteenth-century 
administrative 
system 
was 
an 
attempt 
to 
tame 
the 
arbitrariness 
of 
the 
bureaucrats 
as 
much 
as 
possible 
by 
law. 
It 
served 
as 
a 
model 
for 
all 
other 
liberal 
nations 
which?outside 
of 
the 
realm 
of 
Anglo-
Saxon 
Common 
Law?were 
anxious 
to 
make 
law 
and 
legality 
paramount 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
civil 
administration. 


It 
is 
not 
sufficiently 
known 
that 
the 
Prussian 
administrative 
system, 
so 
much 
admired 
by 
all 
advocates 
of 
government 
omnipotence, 
in 
its 
early 
beginnings 



was 
but 
an 
imitation 
of 
French 
institutions. 
Frederick 
II, 
the 
“Great” 
King, 
imported 
from 
royal 
France 
not 
only 
the 
methods 
but 
even 
the 
personnel 
for 
their 
execution. 
He 
handed 
over 
the 
administration 
of 
the 
excise 
duties 
and 
the 
customs 
to 
an 
imported 
staff 
of 
several 
hundred 
French 
bureaucrats. 
He 
appointed 
a 
Frenchman 
Postmaster 
General 
and 
another 
Frenchman 
President 
of 
the 
Academy. 
The 
eighteenth-century 
Prussians 
had 
even 
better 
grounds 
for 
calling 
bureaucratism 
un-Prussian 
than 
the 
present-day 
Americans 
for 
calling 
it 
un-American. 


The 
legal 
technique 
of 
administrative 
activity 
in 
the 
countries 
of 
Anglo-
Saxon 
Common 
Law 
was 
very 
different 
from 
that 
of 
the 
continental 
countries 
of 
Europe. 
Both 
the 
British 
and 
the 
Americans 
were 
fully 
convinced 
that 
their 
system 
gave 
them 
a 
most 
effective 
protection 
against 
the 
encroachment 
of 
administrative 
arbitrariness. 
However, 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
last 
decades 
has 
clearly 
evidenced 
that 
no 
legal 
precautions 
are 
strong 
enough 
to 
resist 
a 
trend 
supported 
by 
a 
powerful 
ideology. 
The 
popular 
ideas 
of 
government 
interference 
with 
business 
and 
of 
socialism 
have 
undermined 
the 
dams 
erected 
by 
twenty 
generations 
of 
Anglo-Saxons 
against 
the 
flood 
of 
arbitrary 
rule. 
Many 
intellectuals 
and 
numerous 
voters 
organized 
in 
the 
pressure 
groups 
of 
farming 
and 
of 
labor 
disparage 
the 
traditional 
American 
system 
of 
government 
as 
“plutocratic” 
and 
yearn 
for 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
Russian 
methods 
which 
do 
not 
accord 
the 
individual 
any 
protection 
at 
all 
against 
the 
discretionary 
power 
of 
the 
authorities. 


Totalitarianism 
is 
much 
more 
than 
mere 
bureaucracy. 
It 
is 
the 
subordination 
of 
every 
individual’s 
whole 
life, 
work, 
and 
leisure, 
to 
the 
orders 
of 
those 
in 
power 
and 
office. 
It 
is 
the 
reduction 
of 
man 
to 
a 
cog 
in 
an 
all-embracing 
machine 
of 
compulsion 
and 
coercion. 
It 
forces 
the 
individual 
to 
renounce 
any 
activity 
of 
which 
the 
government 
does 
not 
approve. 
It 
tolerates 
no 
expression 
of 
dissent. 
It 
is 
the 
transformation 
of 
society 
into 
a 
strictly 
disciplined 
labor-
army?as 
the 
advocates 
of 
socialism 
say?or 
into 
a 
penitentiary?as 
its 
opponents 
say. 
At 
any 
rate 
it 
is 
the 
radical 
break 
from 
the 
way 
of 
life 
to 
which 
the 
civilized 
nations 
clung 
in 
the 
past. 
It 
is 
not 
merely 
the 
return 
of 
mankind 
to 
the 
oriental 
despotism 
under 
which, 
as 
Hegel 
observed, 
one 
man 
alone 
was 
free 
and 
all 
the 
rest 
slaves, 
for 
those 
Asiatic 
kings 
did 
not 
interfere 
with 
the 
daily 
routine 
of 
their 
subjects. 
To 
the 
individual 
farmers, 
cattle 
breeders, 
and 
artisans 
a 
field 
of 
activities 
was 
left 
in 
the 
performance 
of 



which 
they 
were 
not 
troubled 
by 
the 
king 
and 
his 
satellites. 
They 
enjoyed 
some 
amount 
of 
autonomy 
within 
their 
own 
households 
and 
families. 
It 
is 
different 
with 
modern 
socialism. 
It 
is 
totalitarian 
in 
the 
strict 
sense 
of 
the 
term. 
It 
holds 
the 
individual 
in 
tight 
rein 
from 
the 
womb 
to 
the 
tomb. 
At 
every 
instant 
of 
his 
life 
the 
“comrade” 
is 
bound 
to 
obey 
implicitly 
the 
orders 
issued 
by 
the 
supreme 
authority. 
The 
State 
is 
both 
his 
guardian 
and 
his 
employer. 
The 
State 
determines 
his 
work, 
his 
diet, 
and 
his 
pleasures. 
The 
State 
tells 
him 
what 
to 
think 
and 
what 
to 
believe 
in. 


Bureaucracy 
is 
instrumental 
in 
the 
execution 
of 
these 
plans. 
But 
people 
are 
unfair 
in 
indicting 
the 
individual 
bureaucrat 
for 
the 
vices 
of 
the 
system. 
The 
fault 
is 
not 
with 
the 
men 
and 
women 
who 
fill 
the 
offices 
and 
bureaus. 
They 
are 
no 
less 
the 
victims 
of 
the 
new 
way 
of 
life 
than 
anybody 
else. 
The 
system 
is 
bad, 
not 
its 
subordinate 
handy 
men. 
A 
government 
cannot 
do 
without 
bureaus 
and 
bureaucratic 
methods. 
And 
as 
social 
coöperation 
cannot 
work 
without 
a 
civil 
government, 
some 
amount 
of 
bureaucracy 
is 
indispensable. 
What 
people 
resent 
is 
not 
bureaucratism 
as 
such, 
but 
the 
intrusion 
of 
bureaucracy 
into 
all 
spheres 
of 
human 
life 
and 
activity. 
The 
struggle 
against 
the 
encroachments 
of 
bureaucracy 
is 
essentially 
a 
revolt 
against 
totalitarian 
dictatorship. 
It 
is 
a 
misnomer 
to 
label 
the 
fight 
for 
freedom 
and 
democracy 
a 
fight 
against 
bureaucracy. 


Nonetheless 
there 
is 
some 
substance 
in 
the 
general 
complaint 
against 
bureaucratic 
methods 
and 
procedures. 
For 
their 
faults 
are 
indicative 
of 
the 
essential 
defects 
of 
any 
socialist 
or 
totalitarian 
scheme. 
In 
thoroughly 
investigating 
the 
problem 
of 
bureaucracy 
we 
must 
finally 
discover 
why 
the 
socialist 
utopias 
are 
entirely 
impracticable 
and 
must, 
when 
put 
into 
practice, 
result 
not 
only 
in 
impoverishment 
for 
all 
but 
in 
the 
disintegration 
of 
social 
coöperation?in 
chaos. 
Thus 
the 
study 
of 
bureaucracy 
is 
a 
good 
approach 
to 
a 
study 
of 
both 
systems 
of 
social 
organization, 
capitalism 
and 
socialism. 


5. 
THE 
ALTERNATIVE: 
PROFT 
MANAGEMENT 
OR 
BUREAUCRATIC 
MANAGEMENT 
If 
we 
want 
to 
find 
out 
what 
bureaucracy 
really 
means 
we 
must 
start 
with 
an 
analysis 
of 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
profit 
motive 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
a 
capitalist 
society. 
The 
essential 
features 
of 
capitalism 
are 
no 
less 
unknown 
than 
those 
of 
bureaucracy. 
Spurious 
legends, 
popularized 
by 
demagogic 



propaganda, 
have 
entirely 
misrepresented 
the 
capitalist 
system. 
Capitalism 
has 
succeeded 
in 
raising 
the 
material 
well-being 
of 
the 
masses 
in 
an 
unprecedented 
way. 
In 
the 
capitalist 
countries 
population 
figures 
are 
now 
several 
times 
higher 
than 
they 
were 
at 
the 
eve 
of 
the 
“industrial 
revolution,” 
and 
every 
citizen 
of 
these 
nations 
enjoys 
a 
standard 
of 
living 
much 
higher 
than 
that 
of 
the 
well-to-do 
of 
earlier 
ages. 
Nevertheless 
a 
great 
part 
of 
public 
opinion 
disparages 
free 
enterprise 
and 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
as 
dismal 
institutions 
that 
are 
detrimental 
to 
the 
immense 
majority 
of 
the 
nation 
and 
further 
only 
the 
selfish 
class 
interests 
of 
a 
small 
group 
of 
exploiters. 
Politicians 
whose 
main 
achievement 
consisted 
in 
restricting 
agricultural 
output 
and 
in 
attempts 
to 
put 
obstacles 
in 
the 
way 
of 
technical 
improvement 
of 
methods 
of 
manufacturing 
discredit 
capitalism 
as 
an 
“economy 
of 
scarcity” 
and 
talk 
about 
the 
abundance 
that 
socialism 
will 
bring 
about. 
The 
heads 
of 
labor 
unions, 
whose 
members 
drive 
their 
own 
motor 
cars, 
are 
enthusiastic 
in 
exalting 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
ragged 
and 
barefooted 
Russian 
proletarians 
and 
in 
praising 
the 
freedom 
that 
the 
workers 
enjoy 
in 
Russia 
where 
labor 
unions 
have 
been 
suppressed 
and 
strikes 
are 
a 
criminal 
offense. 


There 
is 
no 
need 
to 
enter 
into 
a 
detailed 
scrutiny 
of 
these 
fables. 
Our 
intention 
is 
neither 
to 
praise 
nor 
to 
condemn. 
We 
want 
to 
know 
what 
the 
two 
systems 
in 
question 
are, 
how 
they 
work, 
and 
how 
they 
serve 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
people. 


In 
spite 
of 
all 
the 
vagueness 
in 
the 
use 
of 
the 
term 
bureaucracy 
there 
seems 
to 
be 
unanimity 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
distinction 
between 
two 
contrary 
methods 
of 
doing 
things: 
the 
private 
citizens’ 
way 
and 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
offices 
of 
the 
government 
and 
the 
municipalities 
are 
operated. 
Nobody 
denies 
that 
the 
principles 
according 
to 
which 
a 
police 
department 
is 
operated 
differ 
essentially 
and 
radically 
from 
the 
principles 
applied 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
a 
profit-
seeking 
enterprise. 
It 
will 
therefore 
be 
appropriate 
to 
begin 
with 
an 
investigation 
of 
the 
methods 
in 
use 
in 
these 
two 
classes 
of 
institutions 
and 
to 
compare 
them 
with 
each 
other. 


Bureaucracy, 
its 
merits 
and 
its 
demerits, 
its 
working 
and 
its 
operation, 
can 
be 
understood 
only 
by 
contrasting 
it 
with 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
profit 
motive 
as 
it 
functions 
in 
the 
capitalistic 
market 
society.

On 
the

we

Benedict 
Arnold

more 
satisfactory 
than 
Lincoln 
as 
a 
pattern 
for 
his 
son.” 
It 
is 
obvious 
that 
those 
who 
hold 
such 
views 
will 
not 
find 
any 
fault 
with 
the 
un-Americanism 
of 
bureaucracy.

taxes,

impact 
of 
which 
has 
already 
been 
perceptible 
in

for 
many 
years,

the 
above-described 
effects 
of 
the 
income

are 
a 
recent 
phenomenon. 
PROFIT 
MANAGEMENT 



1. 
THE 
OPERATION 
OF 
THE 
MARKET 
MECHANISM 
CAPITALISM 
or 
market 
economy 
is 
that 
system 
of 
social 
coöperation 
and 
division 
of 
labor 
that 
is 
based 
on 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
The 
material 
factors 
of 
production 
are 
owned 
by 
individual 
citizens, 
the 
capitalists 
and 
the 
landowners. 
The 
plants 
and 
the 
farms 
are 
operated 
by 
the 
entrepreneurs 
and 
the 
farmers, 
that 
is, 
by 
individuals 
or 
associations 
of 
individuals 
who 
either 
themselves 
own 
the 
capital 
and 
the 
soil 
or 
have 
borrowed 
or 
rented 
them 
from 
the 
owners. 
Free 
enterprise 
is 
the 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
capitalism. 
The 
objective 
of 
every 
enterpriser? 
whether 
businessman 
or 
farmer?is 
to 
make 
profit. 


The 
capitalists, 
the 
enterprisers, 
and 
the 
farmers 
are 
instrumental 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
economic 
affairs. 
They 
are 
at 
the 
helm 
and 
steer 
the 
ship. 
But 
they 
are 
not 
free 
to 
shape 
its 
course. 
They 
are 
not 
supreme, 
they 
are 
steersmen 
only, 
bound 
to 
obey 
unconditionally 
the 
captain’s 
orders. 
The 
captain 
is 
the 
consumer. 


Neither 
the 
capitalists 
nor 
the 
entrepreneurs 
nor 
the 
farmers 
determine 
what 
has 
to 
be 
produced. 
The 
consumers 
do 
that. 
The 
producers 
do 
not 
produce 
for 
their 
own 
consumption 
but 
for 
the 
market. 
They 
are 
intent 
on 
selling 
their 
products. 
If 
the 
consumers 
do 
not 
buy 
the 
goods 
offered 
to 
them, 
the 
businessman 
cannot 
recover 
the 
outlays 
made. 
He 
loses 
his 
money. 
If 
he 
fails 
to 
adjust 
his 
procedure 
to 
the 
wishes 
of 
the 
consumers 
he 
will 
very 
soon 
be 
removed 
from 
his 
eminent 
position 
at 
the 
helm. 
Other 
men 
who 
did 
better 
in 
satisfying 
the 
demand 
of 
the 
consumers 
replace 
him. 


The 
real 
bosses, 
in 
the 
capitalist 
system 
of 
market 
economy, 
are 
the 
consumers. 
They, 
by 
their 
buying 
and 
by 
their 
abstention 
from 
buying, 
decide 
who 
should 
own 
the 
capital 
and 
run 
the 
plants. 
They 
determine 
what 
should 
be 
produced 
and 
in 
what 
quantity 
and 
quality. 
Their 
attitudes 
result 
either 
in 
profit 
or 
in 
loss 
for 
the 
enterpriser. 
They 
make 
poor 
men 
rich 
and 
rich 
men 
poor. 
They 
are 
no 
easy 
bosses. 
They 
are 
full 
of 
whims 
and 
fancies, 



changeable 
and 
unpredictable. 
They 
do 
not 
care 
a 
whit 
for 
past 
merit. 
As 
soon 
as 
something 
is 
offered 
to 
them 
that 
they 
like 
better 
or 
that 
is 
cheaper, 
they 
desert 
their 
old 
purveyors. 
With 
them 
nothing 
counts 
more 
than 
their 
own 
satisfaction. 
They 
bother 
neither 
about 
the 
vested 
interests 
of 
capitalists 
nor 
about 
the 
fate 
of 
the 
workers 
who 
lose 
their 
jobs 
if 
as 
consumers 
they 
no 
longer 
buy 
what 
they 
used 
to 
buy. 


What 
does 
it 
mean 
when 
we 
say 
that 
the 
production 
of 
a 
certain 
commodity 
A 
does 
not 
pay? 
It 
is 
indicative 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
consumers 
are 
not 
willing 
to 
pay 
the 
producers 
of 
A 
enough 
to 
cover 
the 
prices 
of 
the 
required 
factors 
of 
production, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
other 
producers 
will 
find 
their 
incomes 
exceeding 
their 
costs 
of 
production. 
The 
demand 
of 
the 
consumers 
is 
instrumental 
in 
the 
allocation 
of 
various 
factors 
of 
production 
to 
the 
various 
branches 
of 
manufacturing 
consumers’ 
goods. 
The 
consumers 
thus 
decide 
how 
much 
raw 
material 
and 
labor 
should 
be 
used 
for 
the 
manufacturing 
of 
A 
and 
how 
much 
for 
some 
other 
merchandise. 
It 
is 
therefore 
nonsensical 
to 
contrast 
production 
for 
profit 
and 
production 
for 
use. 
With 
the 
profit 
motive 
the 
enterpriser 
is 
compelled 
to 
supply 
the 
consumers 
with 
those 
goods 
which 
they 
are 
asking 
for 
most 
urgently. 
If 
the 
enterpriser 
were 
not 
forced 
to 
take 
the 
profit 
motive 
as 
his 
guide, 
he 
could 
produce 
more 
of 
A, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
consumers 
prefer 
to 
get 
something 
else. 
The 
profit 
motive 
is 
precisely 
the 
factor 
that 
forces 
the 
businessman 
to 
provide 
in 
the 
most 
efficient 
way 
those 
commodities 
the 
consumers 
want 
to 
use. 


Thus 
the 
capitalist 
system 
of 
production 
is 
an 
economic 
democracy 
in 
which 
every 
penny 
gives 
a 
right 
to 
vote. 
The 
consumers 
are 
the 
sovereign 
people. 
The 
capitalists, 
the 
entrepreneurs, 
and 
the 
farmers 
are 
the 
people’s 
mandatories. 
If 
they 
do 
not 
obey, 
if 
they 
fail 
to 
produce, 
at 
the 
lowest 
possible 
cost, 
what 
the 
consumers 
are 
asking 
for, 
they 
lose 
their 
office. 
Their 
task 
is 
service 
to 
the 
consumer. 
Profit 
and 
loss 
are 
the 
instruments 
by 
means 
of 
which 
the 
consumers 
keep 
a 
tight 
rein 
on 
all 
business 
activities. 



2. 
ECONOMIC 
CALCULATION 
The 
preëminence 
of 
the 
capitalist 
system 
consists 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
is 
the 
only 
system 
of 
social 
coöperation 
and 
division 
of 
labor 
which 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
apply 
a 
method 
of 
reckoning 
and 
computation 
in 
planning 
new 
projects 
and 
appraising 
the 
usefulness 
of 
the 
operation 
of 
those 
plants, 
farms, 
and 
workshops 
already 
working. 
The 
impracticability 
of 
all 
schemes 
of 
socialism 
and 
central 
planning 
is 
to 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
impossibility 
of 
any 
kind 
of 
economic 
calculation 
under 
conditions 
in 
which 
there 
is 
no 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
and 
consequently 
no 
market 
prices 
for 
these 
factors. 


The 
problem 
to 
be 
solved 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
economic 
affairs 
is 
this: 
There 
are 
countless 
kinds 
of 
material 
factors 
of 
production, 
and 
within 
each 
class 
they 
differ 
from 
one 
another 
both 
with 
regard 
to 
their 
physical 
properties 
and 
to 
the 
places 
at 
which 
they 
are 
available. 
There 
are 
millions 
and 
millions 
of 
workers 
and 
they 
differ 
widely 
with 
regard 
to 
their 
ability 
to 
work. 
Technology 
provides 
us 
with 
information 
about 
numberless 
possibilities 
in 
regard 
to 
what 
could 
be 
achieved 
by 
using 
this 
supply 
of 
natural 
resources, 
capital 
goods, 
and 
manpower 
for 
the 
production 
of 
consumers’ 
goods. 
Which 
of 
these 
potential 
procedures 
and 
plans 
are 
the 
most 
advantageous? 
Which 
should 
be 
carried 
out 
because 
they 
are 
apt 
to 
contribute 
most 
to 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
the 
most 
urgent 
needs? 
Which 
should 
be 
postponed 
or 
discarded 
because 
their 
execution 
would 
divert 
factors 
of 
production 
from 
other 
projects 
the 
execution 
of 
which 
would 
contribute 
more 
to 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
urgent 
needs? 


It 
is 
obvious 
that 
these 
questions 
cannot 
be 
answered 
by 
some 
calculation 
in 
kind. 
One 
cannot 
make 
a 
variety 
of 
things 
enter 
into 
a 
calculus 
if 
there 
is 
no 
common 
denominator 
for 
them. 


In 
the 
capitalist 
system 
all 
designing 
and 
planning 
is 
based 
on 
the 
market 
prices. 
Without 
them 
all 
the 
projects 
and 
blueprints 
of 
the 
engineers 
would 
be 
a 
mere 
academic 
pastime. 
They 
would 
demonstrate 
what 
could 
be 
done 
and 
how. 
But 
they 
would 
not 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
determine 
whether 
the 
realization 



of 
a 
certain 
project 
would 
really 
increase 
material 
well-being 
or 
whether 
it 
would 
not, 
by 
withdrawing 
scarce 
factors 
of 
production 
from 
other 
lines, 
jeopardize 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
more 
urgent 
needs, 
that 
is, 
of 
needs 
considered 
more 
urgent 
by 
the 
consumers. 
The 
guide 
of 
economic 
planning 
is 
the 
market 
price. 
The 
market 
prices 
alone 
can 
answer 
the 
question 
whether 
the 
execution 
of 
a 
project 
P 
will 
yield 
more 
than 
it 
costs, 
that 
is, 
whether 
it 
will 
be 
more 
useful 
than 
the 
execution 
of 
other 
conceivable 
plans 
which 
cannot 
be 
realized 
because 
the 
factors 
of 
production 
required 
are 
used 
for 
the 
performance 
of 
project 
P. 


It 
has 
been 
frequently 
objected 
that 
this 
orientation 
of 
economic 
activity 
according 
to 
the 
profit 
motive, 
i.e., 
according 
to 
the 
yardstick 
of 
a 
surplus 
of 
yield 
over 
costs, 
leaves 
out 
of 
consideration 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
nation 
as 
a 
whole 
and 
takes 
account 
only 
of 
the 
selfish 
interests 
of 
individuals, 
different 
from 
and 
often 
even 
contrary 
to 
the 
national 
interests. 
This 
idea 
lies 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
all 
totalitarian 
planning. 
Government 
control 
of 
business, 
it 
is 
claimed 
by 
the 
advocates 
of 
authoritarian 
management, 
looks 
after 
the 
nation’s 
well-being, 
while 
free 
enterprise, 
driven 
by 
the 
sole 
aim 
of 
making 
profits, 
jeopardizes 
national 
interests. 


The 
case 
is 
exemplified 
nowadays 
by 
citing 
the 
problem 
of 
synthetic 
rubber. 
Germany, 
under 
the 
rule 
of 
Nazi 
socialism, 
has 
developed 
the 
production 
of 
synthetic 
rubber, 
while 
Great 
Britain 
and 
the 
United 
States, 
under 
the 
supremacy 
of 
profit-seeking 
free 
enterprise, 
did 
not 
care 
about 
the 
unprofitable 
manufacture 
of 
such 
an 
expensive 
Ersatz. 
Thus 
they 
neglected 
an 
important 
item 
of 
war 
preparedness 
and 
exposed 
their 
independence 
to 
a 
serious 
danger. 


Nothing 
can 
be 
more 
spurious 
than 
this 
reasoning. 
Nobody 
ever 
asserted 
that 
the 
conduct 
of 
a 
war 
and 
preparing 
a 
nation’s 
armed 
forces 
for 
the 
emergency 
of 
a 
war 
are 
a 
task 
that 
could 
or 
should 
be 
left 
to 
the 
activities 
of 
individual 
citizens. 
The 
defense 
of 
a 
nation’s 
security 
and 
civilization 
against 
aggression 
on 
the 
part 
both 
of 
foreign 
foes 
and 
of 
domestic 
gangsters 
is 
the 
first 
duty 
of 
any 
government. 
If 
all 
men 
were 
pleasant 
and 
virtuous, 
if 
no 
one 
coveted 
what 
belongs 
to 
another, 
there 
would 
be 
no 
need 
for 
a 
government, 
for 
armies 
and 
navies, 
for 
policemen, 
for 
courts, 
and 
prisons. 
It 
is 
the 
government’s 
business 
to 
make 
the 
provisions 
for 
war. 
No 
individual 
citizen 
and 
no 
group 



or 
class 
of 
citizens 
are 
to 
blame 
if 
the 
government 
fails 
in 
these 
endeavors. 
The 
guilt 
rests 
always 
with 
the 
government 
and 
consequently, 
in 
a 
democracy, 
with 
the 
majority 
of 
voters. 


Germany 
armed 
for 
war. 
As 
the 
German 
General 
Staff 
knew 
that 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
for 
warring 
Germany 
to 
import 
natural 
rubber, 
they 
decided 
to 
foster 
domestic 
production 
of 
synthetic 
rubber. 
There 
is 
no 
need 
to 
inquire 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
British 
and 
American 
military 
authorities 
were 
convinced 
that 
their 
countries, 
even 
in 
case 
of 
a 
new 
World 
War, 
would 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
rely 
upon 
the 
rubber 
plantations 
of 
Malaya 
and 
the 
Dutch 
Indies. 
At 
any 
rate 
they 
did 
not 
consider 
it 
necessary 
to 
pile 
up 
domestic 
stocks 
of 
natural 
rubber 
or 
to 
embark 
upon 
the 
production 
of 
synthetic 
rubber. 
Some 
American 
and 
British 
businessmen 
examined 
the 
progress 
of 
synthetic 
rubber 
production 
in 
Germany. 
But 
as 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
synthetic 
product 
was 
considerably 
higher 
than 
that 
of 
the 
natural 
product, 
they 
could 
not 
venture 
to 
imitate 
the 
example 
set 
by 
the 
Germans. 
No 
entrepreneur 
can 
invest 
money 
in 
a 
project 
which 
does 
not 
offer 
the 
prospect 
of 
profitability. 
It 
is 
precisely 
this 
fact 
that 
makes 
the 
consumers 
sovereign 
and 
forces 
the 
enterpriser 
to 
produce 
what 
the 
consumers 
are 
most 
urgently 
asking 
for. 
The 
consumers, 
that 
is, 
the 
American 
and 
the 
British 
public, 
were 
not 
ready 
to 
allow 
for 
synthetic 
rubber 
prices 
which 
would 
have 
rendered 
its 
production 
profitable. 
The 
cheapest 
way 
to 
provide 
rubber 
was 
for 
the 
Anglo-Saxon 
countries 
to 
produce 
other 
merchandise, 
for 
instance, 
motor 
cars 
and 
various 
machines, 
to 
sell 
these 
things 
abroad, 
and 
to 
import 
foreign 
natural 
rubber. 


If 
it 
had 
been 
possible 
for 
the 
Governments 
of 
London 
and 
Washington 
to 
foresee 
the 
events 
of 
December, 
1941, 
and 
January 
and 
February, 
1942, 
they 
would 
have 
turned 
toward 
measures 
securing 
a 
domestic 
production 
of 
synthetic 
rubber. 
It 
is 
immaterial 
with 
regard 
to 
our 
problem 
which 
method 
they 
would 
have 
chosen 
for 
financing 
this 
part 
of 
defense 
expenditure. 
They 
could 
subsidize 
the 
plants 
concerned 
or 
they 
could 
raise, 
by 
means 
of 
tariffs, 
the 
domestic 
price 
of 
rubber 
to 
such 
a 
level 
that 
home 
production 
of 
synthetic 
rubber 
would 
have 
become 
profitable. 
At 
any 
rate 
the 
people 
would 
have 
been 
forced 
to 
pay 
for 
what 
was 
done. 


If 
the 
government 
does 
not 
provide 
for 
a 
defense 
measure, 
no 
capitalist 
or 
entrepreneur 
can 
fill 
the 
gap. 
To 
reproach 
some 
chemical 
corporations 
for 
not 



having 
taken 
up 
production 
of 
synthetic 
rubber 
is 
no 
more 
sensible 
than 
to 
blame 
the 
motor 
industry 
for 
not, 
immediately 
after 
Hitler’s 
rise 
to 
power, 
converting 
its 
plants 
into 
plane 
factories. 
Or 
it 
would 
be 
as 
justifiable 
to 
blame 
a 
scholar 
for 
having 
wasted 
his 
time 
writing 
a 
book 
on 
American 
history 
or 
philosophy 
instead 
of 
devoting 
all 
his 
efforts 
to 
training 
himself 
for 
his 
future 
functions 
in 
the 
Expeditionary 
Force. 
If 
the 
government 
fails 
in 
its 
task 
of 
equipping 
the 
nation 
to 
repel 
an 
attack, 
no 
individual 
citizen 
has 
any 
way 
open 
to 
remedy 
the 
evil 
but 
to 
criticize 
the 
authorities 
in 
addressing 
the 
sovereign?the 
voters?in 
speeches, 
articles, 
and 
books.1 


Many 
doctors 
describe 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
their 
fellow 
citizens 
spend 
their 
money 
as 
utterly 
foolish 
and 
opposed 
to 
their 
real 
needs. 
People, 
they 
say, 
should 
change 
their 
diet, 
restrict 
their 
consumption 
of 
intoxicating 
beverages 
and 
tobacco, 
and 
employ 
their 
leisure 
time 
in 
a 
more 
reasonable 
manner. 
These 
doctors 
are 
probably 
right. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
the 
task 
of 
government 
to 
improve 
the 
behavior 
of 
its 
“subjects.” 
Neither 
is 
it 
the 
task 
of 
businessmen. 
They 
are 
not 
the 
guardians 
of 
their 
customers. 
If 
the 
public 
prefers 
hard 
to 
soft 
drinks, 
the 
entrepreneurs 
have 
to 
yield 
to 
these 
wishes. 
He 
who 
wants 
to 
reform 
his 
countrymen 
must 
take 
recourse 
to 
persuasion. 
This 
alone 
is 
the 
democratic 
way 
of 
bringing 
about 
changes. 
If 
a 
man 
fails 
in 
his 
endeavors 
to 
convince 
other 
people 
of 
the 
soundness 
of 
his 
ideas, 
he 
should 
blame 
his 
own 
disabilities. 
He 
should 
not 
ask 
for 
a 
law, 
that 
is, 
for 
compulsion 
and 
coercion 
by 
the 
police. 


The 
ultimate 
basis 
of 
economic 
calculation 
is 
the 
valuation 
of 
all 
consumers’ 
goods 
on 
the 
part 
of 
all 
the 
people. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
these 
consumers 
are 
fallible 
and 
that 
their 
judgment 
is 
sometimes 
misguided. 
We 
may 
assume 
that 
they 
would 
appraise 
the 
various 
commodities 
differently 
if 
they 
were 
better 
instructed. 
However, 
as 
human 
nature 
is, 
we 
have 
no 
means 
of 
substituting 
the 
wisdom 
of 
an 
infallible 
authority 
for 
people’s 
shallowness. 


We 
do 
not 
assert 
that 
the 
market 
prices 
are 
to 
be 
considered 
as 
expressive 
of 
any 
perennial 
and 
absolute 
value. 
There 
are 
no 
such 
things 
as 
absolute 
values, 
independent 
of 
the 
subjective 
preferences 
of 
erring 
men. 
Judgments 
of 
value 
are 
the 
outcome 
of 
human 
arbitrariness. 
They 
reflect 
all 
the 
shortcomings 
and 
weaknesses 
of 
their 
authors. 
However, 
the 
only 
alternative 
to 
the 
determination 
of 
market 
prices 
by 
the 
choices 
of 
all 
consumers 
is 
the 



determination 
of 
values 
by 
the 
judgment 
of 
some 
small 
groups 
of 
men, 
no 
less 
liable 
to 
error 
and 
frustration 
than 
the 
majority, 
notwithstanding 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
are 
called 
“authority.” 
No 
matter 
how 
the 
values 
of 
consumers’ 
goods 
are 
determined, 
whether 
they 
are 
fixed 
by 
a 
dictatorial 
decision 
or 
by 
the 
choices 
of 
all 
consumers?the 
whole 
people?values 
are 
always 
relative, 
subjective, 
and 
human, 
never 
absolute, 
objective, 
and 
divine. 


What 
must 
be 
realized 
is 
that 
within 
a 
market 
society 
organized 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
free 
enterprise 
and 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
the 
prices 
of 
consumers’ 
goods 
are 
faithfully 
and 
closely 
reflected 
in 
the 
prices 
of 
the 
various 
factors 
required 
for 
their 
production. 
Thus 
it 
becomes 
feasible 
to 
discover 
by 
means 
of 
a 
precise 
calculation 
which 
of 
the 
indefinite 
multitude 
of 
thinkable 
processes 
of 
production 
are 
more 
advantageous 
and 
which 
less. 
“More 
advantageous” 
means 
in 
this 
connection: 
an 
employment 
of 
these 
factors 
of 
production 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
the 
production 
of 
the 
consumers’ 
goods 
more 
urgently 
asked 
for 
by 
the 
consumers 
gets 
a 
priority 
over 
the 
production 
of 
commodities 
less 
urgently 
asked 
for 
by 
the 
consumers. 
Economic 
calculation 
makes 
it 
possible 
for 
business 
to 
adjust 
production 
to 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
consumers. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
under 
any 
variety 
of 
socialism, 
the 
central 
board 
of 
production 
management 
would 
not 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
engage 
in 
economic 
calculation. 
Where 
there 
are 
no 
markets 
and 
consequently 
no 
market 
prices 
for 
the 
factors 
of 
production, 
they 
cannot 
become 
elements 
of 
a 
calculation. 


For 
a 
full 
understanding 
of 
the 
problems 
involved 
we 
must 
try 
to 
grasp 
the 
nature 
and 
the 
origin 
of 
profit. 


Within 
a 
hypothetical 
system 
without 
any 
change 
there 
would 
not 
be 
any 
profits 
and 
losses 
at 
all. 
In 
such 
a 
stationary 
world, 
in 
which 
nothing 
new 
occurs 
and 
all 
economic 
conditions 
remain 
permanently 
the 
same, 
the 
total 
sum 
that 
a 
manufacturer 
must 
spend 
for 
the 
factors 
of 
production 
required 
would 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
price 
he 
gets 
for 
the 
product. 
The 
prices 
to 
be 
paid 
for 
the 
material 
factors 
of 
production, 
the 
wages 
and 
interest 
for 
the 
capital 
invested, 
would 
absorb 
the 
whole 
price 
of 
the 
product. 
Nothing 
would 
be 
left 
for 
profit. 
It 
is 
obvious 
that 
such 
a 
system 
would 
not 
have 
any 
need 
for 
entrepreneurs 
and 
no 
economic 
function 
for 
profits. 
As 
only 
those 
things 
are 
produced 
today 
which 
were 
produced 
yesterday, 
the 
day 
before 
yesterday, 



last 
year, 
and 
ten 
years 
ago, 
and 
as 
the 
same 
routine 
will 
go 
on 
forever, 
as 
no 
changes 
occur 
in 
the 
supply 
or 
demand 
either 
of 
consumers’ 
or 
of 
producers’ 
goods 
or 
in 
technical 
methods, 
as 
all 
prices 
are 
stable, 
there 
is 
no 
room 
left 
for 
any 
entrepreneurial 
activity. 


But 
the 
actual 
world 
is 
a 
world 
of 
permanent 
change. 
Population 
figures, 
tastes, 
and 
wants, 
the 
supply 
of 
factors 
of 
production 
and 
technological 
methods 
are 
in 
a 
ceaseless 
flux. 
In 
such 
a 
state 
of 
affairs 
there 
is 
need 
for 
a 
continuous 
adjustment 
of 
production 
to 
the 
change 
in 
conditions. 
This 
is 
where 
the 
entrepreneur 
comes 
in. 


Those 
eager 
to 
make 
profits 
are 
always 
looking 
for 
an 
opportunity. 
As 
soon 
as 
they 
discover 
that 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
prices 
of 
the 
factors 
of 
production 
to 
the 
anticipated 
prices 
of 
the 
products 
seem 
to 
offer 
such 
an 
opportunity, 
they 
step 
in. 
If 
their 
appraisal 
of 
all 
the 
elements 
involved 
was 
correct, 
they 
make 
a 
profit. 
But 
immediately 
the 
tendency 
toward 
a 
disappearance 
of 
such 
profits 
begins 
to 
take 
effect. 
As 
an 
outcome 
of 
the 
new 
projects 
inaugurated, 
the 
prices 
of 
the 
factors 
of 
production 
in 
question 
go 
up 
and, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
those 
of 
the 
products 
begin 
to 
drop. 
Profits 
are 
a 
permanent 
phenomenon 
only 
because 
there 
are 
always 
changes 
in 
market 
conditions 
and 
in 
methods 
of 
production. 
He 
who 
wants 
to 
make 
profits 
must 
be 
always 
on 
the 
watch 
for 
new 
opportunities. 
And 
in 
searching 
for 
profit, 
he 
adjusts 
production 
to 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
consuming 
public. 


We 
can 
view 
the 
whole 
market 
of 
material 
factors 
of 
production 
and 
of 
labor 
as 
a 
public 
auction. 
The 
bidders 
are 
the 
entrepreneurs. 
Their 
highest 
bids 
are 
limited 
by 
their 
expectation 
of 
the 
prices 
the 
consumers 
will 
be 
ready 
to 
pay 
for 
the 
products. 
The 
co-bidders 
competing 
with 
them, 
whom 
they 
must 
outbid 
if 
they 
are 
not 
to 
go 
away 
empty-handed, 
are 
in 
the 
same 
situation. 
All 
these 
bidders 
are, 
as 
it 
were, 
acting 
as 
mandatories 
of 
the 
consumers. 
But 
each 
of 
them 
represents 
a 
different 
aspect 
of 
the 
consumers’ 
wants, 
either 
another 
commodity 
or 
another 
way 
of 
producing 
the 
same 
commodity. 
The 
competition 
among 
the 
various 
entrepreneurs 
is 
essentially 
a 
competition 
among 
the 
various 
possibilities 
open 
to 
individuals 
to 
remove 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
their 
state 
of 
uneasiness 
by 
the 
acquisition 
of 
consumers’ 
goods. 
The 
resolution 
of 
any 
man 
to 
buy 
a 
refrigerator 
and 
to 
postpone 
the 
purchase 
of 
a 
new 
car 
is 
a 
determining 
factor 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
prices 
of 
cars 
and 
of 



refrigerators. 
The 
competition 
between 
the 
entrepreneurs 
reflects 
these 
prices 
of 
consumers’ 
goods 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
prices 
of 
the 
factors 
of 
production. 
The 
fact 
that 
the 
various 
wants 
of 
the 
individual, 
which 
conflict 
because 
of 
the 
inexorable 
scarcity 
of 
the 
factors 
of 
production, 
are 
represented 
on 
the 
market 
by 
various 
competing 
entrepreneurs 
results 
in 
prices 
for 
these 
factors 
that 
make 
economic 
calculation 
not 
only 
feasible 
but 
imperative. 
An 
entrepreneur 
who 
does 
not 
calculate, 
or 
disregards 
the 
result 
of 
the 
calculation, 
would 
very 
soon 
go 
bankrupt 
and 
be 
removed 
from 
his 
managerial 
function. 


But 
within 
a 
socialist 
community 
in 
which 
there 
is 
only 
one 
manager 
there 
are 
neither 
prices 
of 
the 
factors 
of 
production 
nor 
economic 
calculation. 
To 
the 
entrepreneur 
of 
capitalist 
society 
a 
factor 
of 
production 
through 
its 
price 
sends 
out 
a 
warning: 
Don’t 
touch 
me, 
I 
am 
earmarked 
for 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
another, 
more 
urgent 
need. 
But 
under 
socialism 
these 
factors 
of 
production 
are 
mute. 
They 
give 
no 
hint 
to 
the 
planner. 
Technology 
offers 
him 
a 
great 
variety 
of 
possible 
solutions 
for 
the 
same 
problem. 
Each 
of 
them 
requires 
the 
outlay 
of 
other 
kinds 
and 
quantities 
of 
various 
factors 
of 
production. 
But 
as 
the 
socialist 
manager 
cannot 
reduce 
them 
to 
a 
common 
denominator, 
he 
is 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
find 
out 
which 
of 
them 
is 
the 
most 
advantageous. 


It 
is 
true 
that 
under 
socialism 
there 
would 
be 
neither 
discernible 
profits 
nor 
discernible 
losses. 
Where 
there 
is 
no 
calculation, 
there 
is 
no 
means 
of 
getting 
an 
answer 
to 
the 
question 
whether 
the 
projects 
planned 
or 
carried 
out 
were 
those 
best 
fitted 
to 
satisfy 
the 
most 
urgent 
needs; 
success 
and 
failure 
remain 
unrecognized 
in 
the 
dark. 
The 
advocates 
of 
socialism 
are 
badly 
mistaken 
in 
considering 
the 
absence 
of 
discernible 
profit 
and 
loss 
an 
excellent 
point. 
It 
is, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
essential 
vice 
of 
any 
socialist 
management. 
It 
is 
not 
an 
advantage 
to 
be 
ignorant 
of 
whether 
or 
not 
what 
one 
is 
doing 
is 
a 
suitable 
means 
of 
attaining 
the 
ends 
sought. 
A 
socialist 
management 
would 
be 
like 
a 
man 
forced 
to 
spend 
his 
life 
blindfolded. 


It 
has 
been 
objected 
that 
the 
market 
system 
is 
at 
any 
rate 
quite 
inappropriate 
under 
the 
conditions 
brought 
about 
by 
a 
great 
war. 
If 
the 
market 
mechanism 
were 
to 
be 
left 
alone, 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
for 
the 
government 
to 
get 
all 
the 
equipment 
needed. 
The 
scarce 
factors 
of 
production 
required 
for 
the 
production 
of 
armaments 
would 
be 
wasted 
for 
civilian 
uses 
which, 
in 
a 
war, 



are 
to 
be 
considered 
as 
less 
important, 
even 
as 
luxury 
and 
waste. 
Thus 
it 
was 
imperative 
to 
resort 
to 
the 
system 
of 
government-established 
priorities 
and 
to 
create 
the 
necessary 
bureaucratic 
apparatus. 


The 
error 
of 
this 
reasoning 
is 
that 
it 
does 
not 
realize 
that 
the 
necessity 
for 
giving 
the 
government 
full 
power 
to 
determine 
for 
what 
kinds 
of 
production 
the 
various 
raw 
materials 
should 
be 
used 
is 
not 
an 
outcome 
of 
the 
war 
but 
of 
the 
methods 
applied 
in 
financing 
the 
war 
expenditure. 


If 
the 
whole 
amount 
of 
money 
needed 
for 
the 
conduct 
of 
the 
war 
had 
been 
collected 
by 
taxes 
and 
by 
borrowing 
from 
the 
public, 
everybody 
would 
have 
been 
forced 
to 
restrict 
his 
consumption 
drastically. 
With 
a 
money 
income 
(after 
taxes) 
much 
lower 
than 
before, 
the 
consumers 
would 
have 
stopped 
buying 
many 
goods 
they 
used 
to 
buy 
before 
the 
war. 
The 
manufacturers, 
precisely 
because 
they 
are 
driven 
by 
the 
profit 
motive, 
would 
have 
discontinued 
producing 
such 
civilian 
goods 
and 
would 
have 
shifted 
to 
the 
production 
of 
those 
goods 
which 
the 
government, 
now 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
inflow 
of 
taxes 
the 
biggest 
buyer 
on 
the 
market, 
would 
be 
ready 
to 
buy. 


However, 
a 
great 
part 
of 
the 
war 
expenditure 
is 
financed 
by 
an 
increase 
of 
currency 
in 
circulation 
and 
by 
borrowing 
from 
the 
commercial 
banks. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
under 
price 
control, 
it 
is 
illegal 
to 
raise 
commodity 
prices. 
With 
higher 
money 
incomes 
and 
with 
unchanged 
commodity 
prices 
people 
would 
not 
only 
not 
have 
restricted 
but 
have 
increased 
their 
buying 
of 
goods 
for 
their 
own 
consumption. 
To 
avoid 
this, 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
take 
recourse 
to 
rationing 
and 
to 
government-imposed 
priorities. 
These 
measures 
were 
needed 
because 
previous 
government 
interference 
that 
paralyzed 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
market 
resulted 
in 
paradoxical 
and 
highly 
unsatisfactory 
conditions. 
Not 
the 
insufficiency 
of 
the 
market 
mechanism 
but 
the 
inadequacy 
of 
previous 
government 
meddling 
with 
market 
phenomena 
made 
the 
priority 
system 
unavoidable. 
In 
this 
as 
in 
many 
other 
instances 
the 
bureaucrats 
see 
in 
the 
failure 
of 
their 
preceding 
measures 
a 
proof 
that 
further 
inroads 
into 
the 
market 
system 
are 
necessary. 



3. 
MANAGEMENT 
UNDER 
THE 
PROFIT 
SYSTEM 
All 
business 
transactions 
are 
examined 
by 
shrewdly 
calculating 
profit 
and 
loss. 
New 
projects 
are 
subject 
to 
a 
precise 
scrutiny 
of 
the 
chances 
they 
offer. 
Every 
step 
toward 
their 
realization 
is 
reflected 
in 
entries 
in 
the 
books 
and 
accounts. 
The 
profit-and-loss 
account 
shows 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
whole 
business, 
or 
any 
of 
its 
parts, 
was 
profitable. 
The 
figures 
of 
the 
ledger 
serve 
as 
a 
guide 
for 
the 
conduct 
of 
the 
whole 
business 
and 
of 
each 
of 
its 
divisions. 
Branches 
which 
do 
not 
pay 
are 
discontinued, 
those 
yielding 
profit 
are 
expanded. 
There 
cannot 
be 
any 
question 
of 
clinging 
to 
unprofitable 
lines 
of 
business 
if 
there 
is 
no 
prospect 
of 
rendering 
them 
profitable 
in 
a 
not-toodistant 
future. 


The 
elaborate 
methods 
of 
modern 
bookkeeping, 
accountancy, 
and 
business 
statistics 
provide 
the 
enterpriser 
with 
a 
faithful 
image 
of 
all 
his 
operations. 
He 
is 
in 
a 
position 
to 
learn 
how 
successful 
or 
unsuccessful 
every 
one 
of 
his 
transactions 
was. 
With 
the 
aid 
of 
these 
statements 
he 
can 
check 
the 
activities 
of 
all 
departments 
of 
his 
concern 
no 
matter 
how 
large 
it 
may 
be. 
There 
is, 
to 
be 
sure, 
some 
amount 
of 
discretion 
in 
determining 
the 
distribution 
of 
overhead 
costs. 
But 
apart 
from 
this, 
the 
figures 
provide 
a 
faithful 
reflection 
of 
all 
that 
is 
going 
on 
in 
every 
branch 
or 
department. 
The 
books 
and 
the 
balance 
sheets 
are 
the 
conscience 
of 
business. 
They 
are 
also 
the 
businessman’s 
compass. 


The 
devices 
of 
bookkeeping 
and 
accountancy 
are 
so 
familiar 
to 
the 
businessman 
that 
he 
fails 
to 
observe 
what 
a 
marvelous 
instrument 
they 
are. 
It 
needed 
a 
great 
poet 
and 
writer 
to 
appreciate 
them 
at 
their 
true 
value. 
Goethe 
called 
bookkeeping 
by 
double-entry 
“one 
of 
the 
finest 
inventions 
of 
the 
human 
mind.” 
By 
means 
of 
this, 
he 
observed, 
the 
businessman 
can 
at 
any 
time 
survey 
the 
general 
whole, 
without 
needing 
to 
perplex 
himself 
with 
the 
details.2 


Goethe’s 
characterization 
hit 
the 
core 
of 
the 
matter. 
The 
virtue 
of 
commercial 
management 
lies 
precisely 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
provides 
the 
manager 
with 
a 



method 
of 
surveying 
the 
whole 
and 
all 
its 
parts 
without 
being 
enmeshed 
in 
details 
and 
trifles. 


The 
entrepreneur 
is 
in 
a 
position 
to 
separate 
the 
calculation 
of 
each 
part 
of 
his 
business 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
he 
can 
determine 
the 
role 
that 
it 
plays 
within 
his 
whole 
enterprise. 
For 
the 
public 
every 
firm 
or 
corporation 
is 
an 
undivided 
unity. 
But 
for 
the 
eye 
of 
its 
management 
it 
is 
composed 
of 
various 
sections, 
each 
of 
which 
is 
viewed 
as 
a 
separate 
entity 
and 
appreciated 
according 
to 
the 
share 
it 
contributes 
to 
the 
success 
of 
the 
whole 
enterprise. 
Within 
the 
system 
of 
business 
calculation 
each 
section 
represents 
an 
integral 
being, 
a 
hypothetical 
independent 
business 
as 
it 
were. 
It 
is 
assumed 
that 
this 
section 
“owns” 
a 
definite 
part 
of 
the 
whole 
capital 
employed 
in 
the 
enterprise, 
that 
it 
buys 
from 
other 
sections 
and 
sells 
to 
them, 
that 
it 
has 
its 
own 
expenses 
and 
its 
own 
revenues, 
that 
its 
dealings 
result 
either 
in 
a 
profit 
or 
a 
loss 
which 
is 
imputed 
to 
its 
own 
conduct 
of 
affairs 
as 
separate 
from 
the 
results 
achieved 
by 
the 
other 
sections. 
Thus 
the 
general 
manager 
of 
the 
whole 
enterprise 
can 
assign 
to 
each 
section’s 
management 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
independence. 
There 
is 
no 
need 
for 
the 
general 
manager 
to 
bother 
about 
the 
minor 
details 
of 
each 
section’s 
management. 
The 
managers 
of 
the 
various 
sections 
can 
have 
a 
free 
hand 
in 
the 
administration 
of 
their 
sections’ 
“internal” 
affairs. 
The 
only 
directive 
that 
the 
general 
manager 
gives 
to 
the 
men 
whom 
he 
entrusts 
with 
the 
management 
of 
the 
various 
sections, 
departments, 
and 
branches 
is: 
Make 
as 
much 
profit 
as 
possible. 
And 
an 
examination 
of 
the 
accounts 
shows 
him 
how 
successful 
or 
unsuccessful 
they 
were 
in 
executing 
the 
directive. 


In 
a 
large-scale 
enterprise 
many 
sections 
produce 
only 
parts 
or 
half-finished 
products 
which 
are 
not 
directly 
sold 
but 
are 
used 
by 
other 
sections 
in 
manufacturing 
the 
final 
product. 
This 
fact 
does 
not 
alter 
the 
conditions 
described. 
The 
general 
manager 
compares 
the 
costs 
incurred 
by 
the 
production 
of 
such 
parts 
and 
half-finished 
products 
with 
the 
prices 
he 
would 
have 
to 
pay 
for 
them 
if 
he 
had 
to 
buy 
them 
from 
other 
plants. 
He 
is 
always 
confronted 
by 
the 
question: 
Does 
it 
pay 
to 
produce 
these 
things 
in 
our 
own 
workshops? 
Would 
it 
not 
be 
more 
satisfactory 
to 
buy 
them 
from 
other 
plants 
specializing 
in 
their 
production? 


Thus 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
a 
profit-seeking 
enterprise 
responsibility 
can 
be 
divided. 
Every 
submanager 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
working 
of 
his 



department. 
It 
is 
to 
his 
credit 
if 
the 
accounts 
show 
a 
profit, 
and 
it 
is 
to 
his 
disadvantage 
if 
they 
show 
a 
loss. 
His 
own 
selfish 
interests 
push 
him 
toward 
the 
utmost 
care 
and 
exertion 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
his 
section’s 
affairs. 
If 
he 
incurs 
losses, 
he 
will 
be 
their 
victim. 
He 
will 
be 
replaced 
by 
another 
man 
whom 
the 
general 
manager 
expects 
to 
be 
more 
successful, 
or 
the 
whole 
section 
will 
be 
discontinued. 
At 
any 
rate 
he 
will 
be 
discharged 
and 
lose 
his 
job. 
If 
he 
succeeds 
in 
making 
profits, 
he 
will 
see 
his 
income 
increased 
or 
at 
least 
he 
will 
not 
be 
in 
danger 
of 
losing 
it. 
Whether 
or 
not 
a 
departmental 
manager 
is 
entitled 
to 
a 
share 
in 
the 
profit 
of 
his 
department 
is 
not 
so 
important 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
personal 
interest 
he 
takes 
in 
the 
results 
of 
his 
department’s 
dealings. 
His 
fate 
is 
at 
any 
rate 
closely 
connected 
with 
that 
of 
his 
department. 
In 
working 
for 
it, 
he 
works 
not 
only 
for 
his 
boss 
but 
also 
for 
himself. 


It 
would 
be 
impracticable 
to 
restrict 
the 
discretion 
of 
such 
a 
responsible 
submanager 
by 
too 
much 
interference 
with 
detail. 
If 
he 
is 
efficient, 
such 
meddling 
would 
at 
best 
be 
superfluous, 
if 
not 
harmful 
by 
tying 
his 
hands. 
If 
he 
is 
inefficient, 
it 
would 
not 
render 
his 
activities 
more 
successful. 
It 
would 
only 
provide 
him 
with 
a 
lame 
excuse 
that 
the 
failure 
was 
caused 
by 
his 
superior’s 
inappropriate 
instructions. 
The 
only 
instruction 
required 
is 
self-
understood 
and 
does 
not 
need 
to 
be 
especially 
mentioned: 
seek 
profit. 
Moreover, 
most 
of 
the 
details 
can 
and 
must 
be 
left 
to 
the 
head 
of 
every 
department. 


This 
system 
was 
instrumental 
in 
the 
evolution 
of 
modern 
business. 
Large-
scale 
production 
in 
great 
production 
aggregates 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
subsidiaries 
in 
distant 
parts 
of 
the 
country 
and 
in 
foreign 
countries, 
the 
department 
stores, 
and 
the 
chain 
stores 
are 
all 
built 
upon 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
subordinate 
managers’ 
responsibility. 
This 
does 
not 
in 
any 
way 
limit 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
general 
manager. 
The 
subordinates 
are 
responsible 
only 
to 
him. 
They 
do 
not 
free 
him 
from 
the 
duty 
of 
finding 
the 
right 
man 
for 
every 
job. 


If 
a 
New 
York 
firm 
establishes 
branch 
shops 
or 
plants 
in 
Los 
Angeles, 
in 
Buenos 
Aires, 
in 
Budapest, 
and 
in 
Calcutta, 
the 
chief 
manager 
establishes 
the 
auxiliary’s 
relation 
to 
the 
head 
office 
or 
parental 
company 
only 
in 
fairly 
general 
terms. 
All 
minor 
questions 
are 
to 
be 
within 
the 
range 
of 
the 
local 



manager’s 
duties. 
The 
auditing 
department 
of 
headquarters 
carefully 
inspects 
the 
branch’s 
financial 
transactions 
and 
informs 
the 
general 
manager 
as 
soon 
as 
any 
irregularities 
appear. 
Precautions 
are 
taken 
to 
prevent 
irreparable 
waste 
of 
the 
capital 
invested 
in 
the 
branch, 
a 
squandering 
of 
the 
whole 
concern’s 
good 
will 
and 
reputation 
and 
a 
collision 
between 
the 
branch’s 
policy 
and 
that 
of 
headquarters. 
But 
a 
free 
hand 
is 
left 
to 
the 
local 
management 
in 
every 
other 
regard. 
It 
is 
practicable 
to 
place 
confidence 
in 
the 
chief 
of 
a 
subsidiary, 
a 
department, 
or 
a 
section 
because 
his 
interests 
and 
those 
of 
the 
whole 
concern 
coincide. 
If 
he 
were 
to 
spend 
too 
much 
for 
current 
operations 
or 
to 
neglect 
an 
opportunity 
for 
profitable 
transactions, 
he 
would 
imperil 
not 
only 
the 
concern’s 
profits 
but 
his 
own 
position 
as 
well. 
He 
is 
not 
simply 
a 
hired 
clerk 
whose 
only 
duty 
is 
the 
conscientious 
accomplishment 
of 
an 
assigned, 
definite 
task. 
He 
is 
a 
businessman 
himself, 
a 
junior 
partner 
as 
it 
were 
of 
the 
entrepreneur, 
no 
matter 
what 
the 
contractual 
and 
financial 
terms 
of 
his 
employment 
are. 
He 
must 
to 
the 
best 
of 
his 
abilities 
contribute 
to 
the 
success 
of 
the 
firm 
with 
which 
he 
is 
connected. 


Because 
this 
is 
so, 
there 
is 
no 
danger 
in 
leaving 
important 
decisions 
to 
his 
discretion. 
He 
will 
not 
waste 
money 
in 
the 
purchase 
of 
products 
and 
services. 
He 
will 
not 
hire 
incompetent 
assistants 
and 
workers; 
he 
will 
not 
discharge 
able 
collaborators 
in 
order 
to 
replace 
them 
by 
incompetent 
personal 
friends 
or 
relatives. 
His 
conduct 
is 
subject 
to 
the 
incorruptible 
judgment 
of 
an 
unbribable 
tribunal: 
the 
account 
of 
profit 
and 
loss. 
In 
business 
there 
is 
only 
one 
thing 
that 
matters: 
success. 
The 
unsuccessful 
department 
manager 
is 
doomed 
no 
matter 
whether 
the 
failure 
was 
caused 
by 
him 
or 
not, 
or 
whether 
it 
would 
have 
been 
possible 
for 
him 
to 
attain 
a 
more 
satisfactory 
result. 
An 
unprofitable 
branch 
of 
business?sooner 
or 
later?must 
be 
discontinued, 
and 
its 
manager 
loses 
his 
job. 


The 
sovereignty 
of 
the 
consumers 
and 
the 
democratic 
operation 
of 
the 
market 
do 
not 
stop 
at 
the 
doors 
of 
a 
big 
business 
concern. 
They 
permeate 
all 
its 
departments 
and 
branches. 
Responsibility 
to 
the 
consumer 
is 
the 
lifeblood 
of 
business 
and 
enterprise 
in 
an 
unhampered 
market 
society. 
The 
profit 
motive 
through 
the 
instrumentality 
of 
which 
the 
entrepreneurs 
are 
driven 
to 
serve 
the 
consumers 
to 
the 
best 
of 
their 
ability 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
first 
principle 
of 
any 
commercial 
and 
industrial 
aggregate’s 
internal 
organization. 
It 
joins 
together 
utmost 
centralization 
of 
the 
whole 
concern 
with 
almost 
complete 



autonomy 
of 
the 
parts, 
it 
brings 
into 
agreement 
full 
responsibility 
of 
the 
central 
management 
with 
a 
high 
degree 
of 
interest 
and 
incentive 
of 
the 
subordinate 
managers 
of 
sections, 
departments, 
and 
auxiliaries. 
It 
gives 
to 
the 
system 
of 
free 
enterprise 
that 
versatility 
and 
adaptability 
which 
result 
in 
an 
unswerving 
tendency 
toward 
improvement. 



4. 
PERSONNEL 
MANAGEMENT 
UNDER 
AN 
UNHAMPERED 
LABOR 
MARKET 
The 
staff 
of 
a 
modern 
large-scale 
enterprise 
sometimes 
includes 
many 
hundreds 
of 
thousands 
of 
clerks 
and 
workers. 
They 
form 
a 
highly 
differentiated 
body 
from 
the 
general 
manager 
or 
president 
down 
to 
the 
scrubwomen, 
messenger 
boys, 
and 
apprentices. 
The 
handling 
of 
such 
a 
huge 
body 
raises 
many 
problems. 
However, 
they 
can 
be 
solved. 


No 
matter 
how 
big 
a 
concern 
may 
be, 
the 
central 
management 
deals 
only 
with 
sections, 
departments, 
branches, 
and 
subsidiaries, 
the 
role 
of 
which 
can 
be 
precisely 
determined 
from 
the 
evidence 
provided 
by 
the 
accounts 
and 
statistics. 
Of 
course, 
the 
accounts 
do 
not 
always 
demonstrate 
what 
may 
be 
wrong 
with 
a 
section. 
They 
show 
only 
that 
something 
is 
wrong, 
that 
it 
does 
not 
pay, 
and 
must 
be 
either 
reformed 
or 
discontinued. 
The 
sentences 
they 
pass 
are 
unappealable. 
They 
reveal 
each 
department’s 
cash 
value. 
And 
it 
is 
cash 
value 
alone 
that 
matters 
on 
the 
market. 
The 
consumers 
are 
merciless. 
They 
never 
buy 
in 
order 
to 
benefit 
a 
less 
efficient 
producer 
and 
to 
protect 
him 
against 
the 
consequences 
of 
his 
failure 
to 
manage 
better. 
They 
want 
to 
be 
served 
as 
well 
as 
possible. 
And 
the 
working 
of 
the 
capitalist 
system 
forces 
the 
entrepreneur 
to 
obey 
the 
orders 
issued 
by 
the 
consumers. 
He 
does 
not 
have 
the 
power 
to 
distribute 
bounties 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
consumers. 
He 
would 
waste 
his 
funds 
if 
he 
were 
to 
use 
his 
own 
money 
for 
such 
a 
purpose. 
He 
simply 
cannot 
pay 
anybody 
more 
than 
he 
can 
realize 
in 
selling 
the 
product. 


The 
same 
relation 
that 
exists 
between 
the 
general 
manager 
and 
his 
immediate 
subordinates, 
the 
heads 
of 
the 
various 
sections, 
pervades 
the 
whole 
business 
hierarchy. 
Every 
section 
head 
values 
his 
immediate 
subordinates 
according 
to 
the 
same 
principle 
by 
which 
the 
chief 
manager 
values 
him, 
and 
the 
foreman 
applies 
similar 
methods 
in 
appraising 
his 
subordinates. 
The 
only 
difference 
is 
that 
under 
the 
simpler 
conditions 
of 
the 
lower 
units 
no 
elaborate 
accountancy 
schemes 
are 
required 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
each 
man’s 
cash 
value. 
It 
does 
not 
matter 
whether 
piece 
wages 
or 
hourly 
wages 
are 
paid. 
In 
the 
long 
run 
the 
worker 
can 
never 
get 
more 
than 
the 
consumer 
allows. 



No 
man 
is 
infallible. 
It 
often 
happens 
that 
a 
superior 
errs 
in 
judging 
a 
subordinate. 
One 
of 
the 
qualifications 
required 
for 
any 
higher 
position 
is 
precisely 
the 
ability 
to 
judge 
people 
correctly. 
He 
who 
fails 
in 
this 
regard 
jeopardizes 
his 
chances 
of 
success. 
He 
hurts 
his 
own 
interests 
no 
less 
than 
those 
of 
the 
men 
whose 
efficiency 
he 
has 
underrated. 
Things 
being 
so, 
there 
is 
no 
need 
to 
look 
for 
special 
protection 
for 
the 
employees 
against 
arbitrariness 
on 
the 
part 
of 
their 
employers 
or 
their 
employer’s 
mandatories. 
Arbitrariness 
in 
dealing 
with 
personnel 
is, 
under 
the 
unhampered 
profit 
system, 
an 
offense 
that 
strikes 
home 
to 
its 
author. 


Under 
an 
unhampered 
market 
economy 
the 
appraisal 
of 
each 
individual’s 
effort 
is 
detached 
from 
any 
personal 
considerations 
and 
can 
therefore 
be 
free 
both 
from 
bias 
and 
dislike. 
The 
market 
passes 
judgment 
on 
the 
products, 
not 
on 
the 
producers. 
The 
appraisal 
of 
the 
producer 
results 
automatically 
from 
the 
appraisal 
of 
his 
product. 
Each 
cooperator 
is 
valued 
according 
to 
the 
value 
of 
his 
contribution 
to 
the 
process 
of 
production 
of 
goods 
and 
services. 
Salaries 
and 
wages 
do 
not 
depend 
on 
arbitrary 
decisions. 
On 
the 
labor 
market 
every 
quantity 
and 
quality 
of 
work 
is 
prized 
to 
the 
amount 
the 
consumers 
are 
ready 
to 
pay 
for 
the 
products. 
It 
is 
not 
a 
favor 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
employer 
to 
pay 
wages 
and 
salaries, 
it 
is 
a 
business 
transaction, 
the 
purchase 
of 
a 
factor 
of 
production. 
The 
price 
of 
labor 
is 
a 
market 
phenomenon 
determined 
by 
the 
consumers’ 
demands 
for 
goods 
and 
services. 
Virtually 
every 
employer 
is 
always 
in 
search 
of 
cheaper 
labor 
and 
every 
employee 
in 
search 
of 
a 
job 
with 
higher 
remuneration. 


The 
very 
fact 
that 
labor 
is, 
under 
capitalism, 
a 
commodity 
and 
is 
bought 
and 
sold 
as 
a 
commodity 
makes 
the 
wage 
earner 
free 
from 
any 
personal 
dependence. 
Like 
the 
capitalists, 
the 
entrepreneurs, 
and 
the 
farmers, 
the 
wage 
earner 
depends 
on 
the 
arbitrariness 
of 
the 
consumers. 
But 
the 
consumers’ 
choices 
do 
not 
concern 
the 
persons 
engaged 
in 
production; 
they 
concern 
things 
and 
not 
men. 
The 
employer 
is 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
indulge 
in 
favoritism 
or 
in 
prejudice 
with 
regard 
to 
personnel. 
As 
far 
as 
he 
does, 
the 
deed 
itself 
brings 
about 
its 
own 
penalty. 


It 
is 
this 
fact, 
and 
not 
only 
constitutions 
and 
bills 
of 
rights, 
that 
makes 
the 
receivers 
of 
salaries 
and 
wages 
within 
an 
unhampered 
capitalist 
system 
free 
men. 
They 
are 
sovereign 
in 
their 
capacity 
as 
consumers, 
and 
as 
producers 



they 
are, 
like 
all 
other 
citizens, 
unconditionally 
subject 
to 
the 
law 
of 
the 
market. 
In 
selling 
a 
factor 
of 
production, 
namely, 
their 
toil 
and 
trouble, 
on 
the 
market 
at 
the 
market 
price 
to 
everybody 
who 
is 
ready 
to 
buy 
it, 
they 
do 
not 
jeopardize 
their 
own 
standing. 
They 
do 
not 
owe 
their 
employer 
thanks 
and 
subservience, 
they 
owe 
him 
a 
definite 
quantity 
of 
labor 
of 
a 
definite 
quality. 
The 
employer, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
is 
not 
in 
search 
of 
sympathetic 
men 
whom 
he 
likes 
but 
efficient 
workers 
who 
are 
worth 
the 
money 
he 
pays 
them. 


This 
cool 
rationality 
and 
objectivity 
of 
capitalist 
relations 
is, 
of 
course, 
not 
realized 
to 
the 
same 
degree 
in 
the 
whole 
field 
of 
business. 
The 
nearer 
a 
man’s 
function 
brings 
him 
to 
the 
consumers, 
the 
more 
personal 
factors 
interfere. 
In 
the 
service 
trades 
some 
role 
is 
played 
by 
sympathies 
and 
antipathies; 
relations 
are 
more 
“human.” 
Stubborn 
doctrinaires 
and 
adamant 
baiters 
of 
capitalism 
are 
prepared 
to 
call 
this 
an 
advantage. 
In 
fact 
it 
curtails 
the 
businessman’s 
and 
his 
employees’ 
personal 
freedom. 
A 
small 
shopkeeper, 
a 
barber, 
an 
innkeeper, 
and 
an 
actor 
are 
not 
so 
free 
in 
expressing 
their 
political 
or 
religious 
convictions 
as 
the 
owner 
of 
a 
cotton 
mill 
or 
a 
worker 
in 
a 
steel 
plant. 


But 
these 
facts 
do 
not 
invalidate 
the 
general 
characteristics 
of 
the 
market 
system. 
It 
is 
a 
system 
which 
automatically 
values 
every 
man 
according 
to 
the 
services 
he 
renders 
to 
the 
body 
of 
sovereign 
consumers, 
i.e., 
to 
his 
fellow 
men. 


1. 
These 
observations 
do 
not 
imply 
any 
criticism 
of 
the 
prewar 
policies 
pursued 
by 
the 
British 
and 
American 
authorities. 
Only 
a 
man 
who 
had 
knowledge 
of 
the 
military 
events 
of 
1941–43 
many 
years 
before 
they 
occurred 
would 
have 
the 
right 
to 
blame 
other 
people 
for 
their 
lack 
of 
foresight. 
Governments 
are 
not 
omniscient, 
as 
the 
planners 
would 
have 
us 
believe.

BUREAUCRATIC 
MANAGEMENT 



1. 
BUREAUCRACY 
UNDER 
DESPOTIC 
GOVERNMENT 
THE 
chieftain 
of 
a 
small 
primitive 
tribe 
is 
as 
a 
rule 
in 
a 
position 
to 
concentrate 
in 
his 
hands 
all 
legislative, 
administrative, 
and 
judiciary 
power. 
His 
will 
is 
the 
law. 
He 
is 
both 
executive 
and 
judge. 


But 
it 
is 
different 
when 
the 
despot 
has 
succeeded 
in 
expanding 
the 
size 
of 
his 
realm. 
As 
he 
lacks 
ubiquity, 
he 
must 
delegate 
a 
part 
of 
his 
power 
to 
subordinates. 
They 
are, 
in 
their 
districts, 
his 
deputies, 
acting 
in 
his 
name 
and 
under 
his 
auspices. 
In 
fact 
they 
become 
local 
despots 
only 
nominally 
subject 
to 
the 
mighty 
overlord 
who 
has 
appointed 
them. 
They 
rule 
their 
provinces 
according 
to 
their 
own 
will, 
they 
become 
satraps. 
The 
great 
king 
has 
the 
power 
to 
discharge 
them 
and 
to 
appoint 
a 
successor. 
But 
that 
is 
no 
remedy 
either. 
The 
new 
governor 
also 
soon 
becomes 
an 
almost 
independent 
satrap. 
What 
some 
critics?wrongly?assert 
with 
regard 
to 
representative 
democracy, 
namely, 
that 
the 
people 
is 
sovereign 
only 
on 
election 
day, 
is 
literally 
true 
with 
regard 
to 
such 
a 
system 
of 
despotism; 
the 
king 
is 
sovereign 
in 
the 
provinces 
only 
on 
the 
day 
he 
appoints 
a 
new 
governor. 


In 
what 
does 
the 
position 
of 
such 
a 
provincial 
governor 
differ 
from 
that 
of 
the 
manager 
of 
a 
business 
branch? 
The 
manager 
of 
the 
whole 
concern 
hands 
over 
an 
aggregate 
to 
the 
newly 
appointed 
branch 
manager 
and 
gives 
him 
one 
directive 
only: 
Make 
profits. 
This 
order, 
the 
observance 
of 
which 
is 
continuously 
checked 
by 
the 
accounts, 
is 
sufficient 
to 
make 
the 
branch 
a 
subservient 
part 
of 
the 
whole 
concern 
and 
to 
give 
to 
its 
manager’s 
action 
the 
direction 
aimed 
at 
by 
the 
central 
manager. 
But 
if 
the 
despot, 
for 
whom 
his 
own 
arbitrary 
decision 
is 
the 
only 
principle 
of 
government, 
appoints 
a 
governor 
and 
says 
to 
him: 
“Be 
my 
deputy 
in 
this 
province,” 
he 
makes 
the 
deputy’s 
arbitrariness 
supreme 
in 
this 
province. 
He 
renounces, 
at 
least 
temporarily, 
his 
own 
power 
to 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
governor. 


In 
order 
to 
avoid 
this 
outcome 
the 
king 
tries 
to 
limit 
the 
governor’s 
powers 
by 
issuing 
directives 
and 
instructions. 
Codes, 
decrees, 
and 
statutes 
tell 
the 



governors 
of 
the 
provinces 
and 
their 
subordinates 
what 
to 
do 
if 
such 
or 
such 
a 
problem 
arises. 
Their 
free 
discretion 
is 
now 
limited; 
their 
first 
duty 
is 
now 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
regulations. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
their 
arbitrariness 
is 
now 
restricted 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
regulations 
must 
be 
applied. 
But 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
whole 
character 
of 
their 
management 
changes. 
They 
are 
no 
longer 
eager 
to 
deal 
with 
each 
case 
to 
the 
best 
of 
their 
abilities; 
they 
are 
no 
longer 
anxious 
to 
find 
the 
most 
appropriate 
solution 
for 
every 
problem. 
Their 
main 
concern 
is 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
rules 
and 
regulations, 
no 
matter 
whether 
they 
are 
reasonable 
or 
contrary 
to 
what 
was 
intended. 
The 
first 
virtue 
of 
an 
administrator 
is 
to 
abide 
by 
the 
codes 
and 
decrees. 
He 
becomes 
a 
bureaucrat. 



2. 
BUREAUCRACY 
WITHIN 
A 
DEMOCRACY 
The 
same 
thing 
is 
essentially 
valid 
for 
democratic 
government. 


It 
is 
frequently 
asserted 
that 
bureaucratic 
management 
is 
incompatible 
with 
democratic 
government 
and 
institutions. 
This 
is 
a 
fallacy. 
Democracy 
implies 
the 
supremacy 
of 
the 
law. 
If 
it 
were 
otherwise, 
the 
officeholders 
would 
be 
irresponsible 
and 
arbitrary 
despots 
and 
the 
judges 
inconstant 
and 
capricious 
cadis. 
The 
two 
pillars 
of 
democratic 
government 
are 
the 
primacy 
of 
the 
law 
and 
the 
budget.1 


Primacy 
of 
the 
law 
means 
that 
no 
judge 
or 
officeholder 
has 
the 
right 
to 
interfere 
with 
any 
individual’s 
affairs 
or 
conditions 
unless 
a 
valid 
law 
requires 
or 
empowers 
him 
to 
do 
so. 
Nulla 
poena 
sine 
lege, 
no 
punishment 
unless 
ordered 
by 
a 
law. 
It 
is 
precisely 
the 
inability 
of 
the 
Nazis 
to 
understand 
the 
importance 
of 
this 
fundamental 
principle 
that 
qualifies 
them 
as 
antidemocratic. 
In 
the 
totalitarian 
system 
of 
Hitler 
Germany 
the 
judge 
has 
to 
come 
to 
his 
decision 
according 
to 
das 
gesunde 
Volksempfinden, 
i.e., 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
sound 
feelings 
of 
the 
people. 
As 
the 
judge 
himself 
has 
to 
decide 
what 
the 
sound 
feelings 
of 
the 
people 
are, 
he 
is 
sovereign 
on 
his 
bench 
like 
the 
chieftain 
of 
a 
primitive 
tribe. 


It 
is 
in 
fact 
an 
awkward 
thing 
if 
a 
scoundrel 
evades 
punishment 
because 
a 
law 
is 
defective. 
But 
it 
is 
the 
minor 
evil 
when 
compared 
with 
judicial 
arbitrariness. 
If 
the 
legislators 
acknowledge 
that 
the 
law 
is 
inadequate 
they 
can 
substitute 
a 
more 
satisfactory 
law 
for 
a 
less 
satisfactory. 
They 
are 
the 
mandatories 
of 
the 
sovereign, 
the 
people; 
they 
are, 
in 
this 
capacity, 
supreme 
and 
responsible 
to 
the 
voters. 
If 
the 
voters 
disapprove 
of 
the 
methods 
applied 
by 
their 
representatives, 
they 
will, 
at 
the 
next 
election, 
return 
other 
men 
who 
know 
better 
how 
to 
adjust 
their 
actions 
to 
the 
will 
of 
the 
majority. 


It 
is 
the 
same 
with 
the 
executive 
power. 
In 
this 
field 
too 
there 
is 
only 
the 
alternative 
between 
the 
arbitrary 
rule 
of 
despotic 
officeholders 
and 
the 
rule 
of 
the 
people 
enforced 
by 
the 
instrumentality 
of 
law 
abidance. 
It 
is 
a 
euphemism 



to 
call 
a 
government 
in 
which 
the 
rulers 
are 
free 
to 
do 
whatever 
they 
themselves 
believe 
best 
serves 
the 
commonweal 
a 
welfare 
state, 
and 
to 
contrast 
it 
with 
the 
state 
in 
which 
the 
administration 
is 
bound 
by 
law 
and 
the 
citizens 
can 
make 
good 
in 
a 
court 
of 
law 
their 
rights 
against 
illegal 
encroachments 
of 
the 
authorities. 
This 
so-called 
welfare 
state 
is 
in 
fact 
the 
tyranny 
of 
the 
rulers. 
(Incidentally 
we 
have 
to 
realize 
that 
even 
a 
despotic 
government 
cannot 
do 
without 
regulations 
and 
bureaucratic 
directives 
if 
it 
is 
not 
to 
degenerate 
into 
a 
chaotic 
regime 
of 
local 
caciques 
and 
to 
disintegrate 
into 
a 
multitude 
of 
petty 
despotisms.) 
The 
aim 
of 
the 
constitutional 
state 
also 
is 
public 
welfare. 
The 
characteristic 
feature 
that 
distinguishes 
it 
from 
despotism 
is 
that 
not 
the 
authorities 
but 
the 
duly 
elected 
people’s 
representatives 
have 
to 
decide 
what 
best 
serves 
the 
commonweal. 
This 
system 
alone 
makes 
the 
people 
sovereign 
and 
secures 
their 
right 
of 
self-
determination. 
Under 
this 
system 
the 
citizens 
are 
not 
only 
sovereign 
on 
election 
day 
but 
no 
less 
so 
between 
elections. 


The 
administration, 
in 
a 
democratic 
community, 
is 
not 
only 
bound 
by 
law 
but 
by 
the 
budget. 
Democratic 
control 
is 
budgetary 
control. 
The 
people’s 
representatives 
have 
the 
keys 
of 
the 
treasury. 
Not 
a 
penny 
must 
be 
spent 
without 
the 
consent 
of 
parliament. 
It 
is 
illegal 
to 
use 
public 
funds 
for 
any 
expenditures 
other 
than 
those 
for 
which 
parliament 
has 
allocated 
them. 


Bureaucratic 
management 
means, 
under 
democracy, 
management 
in 
strict 
accordance 
with 
the 
law 
and 
the 
budget. 
It 
is 
not 
for 
the 
personnel 
of 
the 
administration 
and 
for 
the 
judges 
to 
inquire 
what 
should 
be 
done 
for 
the 
public 
welfare 
and 
how 
the 
public 
funds 
should 
be 
spent. 
This 
is 
the 
task 
of 
the 
sovereign, 
the 
people, 
and 
their 
representatives. 
The 
courts, 
the 
various 
branches 
of 
the 
administration, 
the 
army, 
and 
the 
navy 
execute 
what 
the 
law 
and 
the 
budget 
order 
them 
to 
do. 
Not 
they 
but 
the 
sovereign 
is 
policy-making. 


Most 
of 
the 
tyrants, 
despots, 
and 
dictators 
are 
sincerely 
convinced 
that 
their 
rule 
is 
beneficial 
for 
the 
people, 
that 
theirs 
is 
government 
for 
the 
people. 
There 
is 
no 
need 
to 
investigate 
whether 
these 
claims 
of 
Messrs. 
Hitler, 
Stalin, 
and 
Franco 
are 
well 
founded 
or 
not. 
At 
any 
rate 
their 
system 
is 
neither 
government 
of 
the 
people 
nor 
by 
the 
people. 
It 
is 
not 
democratic 
but 
authoritarian. 


The 
assertion 
that 
bureaucratic 
management 
is 
an 
indispensable 
instrument 
of 



democratic 
government 
is 
paradoxical. 
Many 
will 
object. 
They 
are 
accustomed 
to 
consider 
democratic 
government 
as 
the 
best 
system 
of 
government 
and 
bureaucratic 
management 
as 
one 
of 
the 
great 
evils. 
How 
can 
these 
two 
things, 
one 
good, 
the 
other 
bad, 
be 
linked 
together? 


Moreover, 
America 
is 
an 
old 
democracy 
and 
the 
talk 
about 
the 
dangers 
of 
bureaucracy 
is 
a 
new 
phenomenon 
in 
this 
country. 
Only 
in 
recent 
years 
have 
people 
become 
aware 
of 
the 
menace 
of 
bureaucracy, 
and 
they 
consider 
bureaucracy 
not 
an 
instrument 
of 
democratic 
government 
but, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
worst 
enemy 
of 
freedom 
and 
democracy. 


To 
these 
objections 
we 
must 
answer 
again 
that 
bureaucracy 
in 
itself 
is 
neither 
good 
nor 
bad. 
It 
is 
a 
method 
of 
management 
which 
can 
be 
applied 
in 
different 
spheres 
of 
human 
activity. 
There 
is 
a 
field, 
namely, 
the 
handling 
of 
the 
apparatus 
of 
government, 
in 
which 
bureaucratic 
methods 
are 
required 
by 
necessity. 
What 
many 
people 
nowadays 
consider 
an 
evil 
is 
not 
bureaucracy 
as 
such, 
but 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
sphere 
in 
which 
bureaucratic 
management 
is 
applied. 
This 
expansion 
is 
the 
unavoidable 
consequence 
of 
the 
progressive 
restriction 
of 
the 
individual 
citizen’s 
freedom, 
of 
the 
inherent 
trend 
of 
present-day 
economic 
and 
social 
policies 
toward 
the 
substitution 
of 
government 
control 
for 
private 
initiative. 
People 
blame 
bureaucracy, 
but 
what 
they 
really 
have 
in 
mind 
are 
the 
endeavors 
to 
make 
the 
state 
socialist 
and 
totalitarian. 


There 
has 
always 
been 
bureaucracy 
in 
America. 
The 
administration 
of 
the 
customs 
and 
of 
the 
foreign 
service 
has 
always 
been 
conducted 
according 
to 
bureaucratic 
principles. 
What 
characterizes 
our 
time 
is 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
sphere 
of 
government 
interference 
with 
business 
and 
with 
many 
other 
items 
of 
the 
citizenry’s 
affairs. 
And 
this 
results 
in 
a 
substitution 
of 
bureaucratic 
management 
for 
profit 
management. 



3. 
THE 
ESSENTIAL 
FEATURES 
OF 
BUREAUCRATIC 
MANAGEMENT 
The 
lawyers, 
the 
philosophers, 
and 
the 
politicians 
look 
upon 
the 
supremacy 
of 
the 
law 
from 
another 
angle 
than 
does 
this 
book. 
From 
their 
point 
of 
view 
the 
main 
function 
of 
the 
law 
is 
to 
limit 
the 
power 
of 
the 
authorities 
and 
the 
courts 
to 
inflict 
evils 
upon 
the 
individual 
citizen 
and 
to 
restrict 
his 
freedom. 
If 
one 
assigns 
to 
the 
authorities 
the 
power 
to 
imprison 
or 
even 
to 
kill 
people, 
one 
must 
restrict 
and 
clearly 
circumscribe 
this 
power. 
Otherwise 
the 
officeholder 
or 
judge 
would 
turn 
into 
an 
irresponsible 
despot. 
The 
law 
determines 
under 
what 
conditions 
the 
judge 
should 
have 
the 
right 
and 
the 
duty 
to 
sentence 
and 
the 
policeman 
to 
fire 
his 
gun. 
The 
law 
protects 
the 
people 
against 
the 
arbitrariness 
of 
those 
in 
office. 


The 
viewpoint 
of 
this 
book 
is 
somewhat 
different. 
We 
are 
dealing 
here 
with 
bureaucracy 
as 
a 
principle 
of 
administrative 
technique 
and 
organization. 
This 
book 
looks 
upon 
the 
rules 
and 
regulations 
not 
merely 
as 
measures 
for 
the 
protection 
of 
the 
people 
and 
for 
safeguarding 
the 
citizen’s 
rights 
and 
freedom 
but 
as 
measures 
for 
the 
execution 
of 
the 
will 
of 
the 
supreme 
authority. 
The 
need 
to 
limit 
the 
discretion 
of 
subordinates 
is 
present 
in 
every 
organization. 
Any 
organization 
would 
disintegrate 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
such 
restrictions. 
Our 
task 
is 
to 
investigate 
the 
peculiar 
characteristics 
of 
bureaucratic 
management 
as 
distinguished 
from 
commercial 
management. 


Bureaucratic 
management 
is 
management 
bound 
to 
comply 
with 
detailed 
rules 
and 
regulations 
fixed 
by 
the 
authority 
of 
a 
superior 
body. 
The 
task 
of 
the 
bureaucrat 
is 
to 
perform 
what 
these 
rules 
and 
regulations 
order 
him 
to 
do. 
His 
discretion 
to 
act 
according 
to 
his 
own 
best 
conviction 
is 
seriously 
restricted 
by 
them. 


Business 
management 
or 
profit 
management 
is 
management 
directed 
by 
the 
profit 
motive. 
The 
objective 
of 
business 
management 
is 
to 
make 
a 
profit. 
As 
success 
or 
failure 
to 
attain 
this 
end 
can 
be 
ascertained 
by 
accounting 
not 
only 
for 
the 
whole 
business 
concern 
but 
also 
for 
any 
of 
its 
parts, 
it 
is 
feasible 
to 
decentralize 
both 
management 
and 
accountability 
without 
jeopardizing 
the 



unity 
of 
operations 
and 
the 
attainment 
of 
their 
goal. 
Responsibility 
can 
be 
divided. 
There 
is 
no 
need 
to 
limit 
the 
discretion 
of 
subordinates 
by 
any 
rules 
or 
regulations 
other 
than 
that 
underlying 
all 
business 
activities, 
namely, 
to 
render 
their 
operations 
profitable. 


The 
objectives 
of 
public 
administration 
cannot 
be 
measured 
in 
money 
terms 
and 
cannot 
be 
checked 
by 
accountancy 
methods. 
Take 
a 
nation-wide 
police 
system 
like 
the 
F.B.I. 
There 
is 
no 
yardstick 
available 
that 
could 
establish 
whether 
the 
expenses 
incurred 
by 
one 
of 
its 
regional 
or 
local 
branches 
were 
not 
excessive. 
The 
expenditures 
of 
a 
police 
station 
are 
not 
reimbursed 
by 
its 
successful 
management 
and 
do 
not 
vary 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
success 
attained. 
If 
the 
head 
of 
the 
whole 
bureau 
were 
to 
leave 
his 
subordinate 
station 
chiefs 
a 
free 
hand 
with 
regard 
to 
money 
expenditure, 
the 
result 
would 
be 
a 
large 
increase 
in 
costs 
as 
every 
one 
of 
them 
would 
be 
zealous 
to 
improve 
the 
service 
of 
his 
branch 
as 
much 
as 
possible. 
It 
would 
become 
impossible 
for 
the 
top 
executive 
to 
keep 
the 
expenditures 
within 
the 
appropriations 
allocated 
by 
the 
representatives 
of 
the 
people 
or 
within 
any 
limits 
whatever. 
It 
is 
not 
because 
of 
punctiliousness 
that 
the 
administrative 
regulations 
fix 
how 
much 
can 
be 
spent 
by 
each 
local 
office 
for 
cleaning 
the 
premises, 
for 
furniture 
repairs, 
and 
for 
lighting 
and 
heating. 
Within 
a 
business 
concern 
such 
things 
can 
be 
left 
without 
hesitation 
to 
the 
discretion 
of 
the 
responsible 
local 
manager. 
He 
will 
not 
spend 
more 
than 
necessary 
because 
it 
is, 
as 
it 
were, 
his 
money; 
if 
he 
wastes 
the 
concern’s 
money, 
he 
jeopardizes 
the 
branch’s 
profit 
and 
thereby 
indirectly 
hurts 
his 
own 
interests. 
But 
it 
is 
another 
matter 
with 
the 
local 
chief 
of 
a 
government 
agency. 
In 
spending 
more 
money 
he 
can, 
very 
often 
at 
least, 
improve 
the 
result 
of 
his 
conduct 
of 
affairs. 
Thrift 
must 
be 
imposed 
on 
him 
by 
regimentation. 


In 
public 
administration 
there 
is 
no 
connection 
between 
revenue 
and 
expenditure. 
The 
public 
services 
are 
spending 
money 
only; 
the 
insignificant 
income 
derived 
from 
special 
sources 
(for 
example, 
the 
sale 
of 
printed 
matter 
by 
the 
Government 
Printing 
Office) 
is 
more 
or 
less 
accidental. 
The 
revenue 
derived 
from 
customs 
and 
taxes 
is 
not 
“produced” 
by 
the 
administrative 
apparatus. 
Its 
source 
is 
the 
law, 
not 
the 
activities 
of 
customs 
officers 
and 
tax 
collectors. 
It 
is 
not 
the 
merit 
of 
a 
collector 
of 
internal 
revenue 
that 
the 
residents 
of 
his 
district 
are 
richer 
and 
pay 
higher 
taxes 
than 
those 
of 
another 
district. 
The 
time 
and 
effort 
required 
for 
the 
administrative 
handling 
of 
an 



income 
tax 
return 
are 
not 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
the 
taxable 
income 
it 
concerns. 


In 
public 
administration 
there 
is 
no 
market 
price 
for 
achievements. 
This 
makes 
it 
indispensable 
to 
operate 
public 
offices 
according 
to 
principles 
entirely 
different 
from 
those 
applied 
under 
the 
profit 
motive. 


Now 
we 
are 
in 
a 
position 
to 
provide 
a 
definition 
of 
bureaucratic 
management: 
Bureaucratic 
management 
is 
the 
method 
applied 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
administrative 
affairs 
the 
result 
of 
which 
has 
no 
cash 
value 
on 
the 
market. 
Remember: 
we 
do 
not 
say 
that 
a 
successful 
handling 
of 
public 
affairs 
has 
no 
value, 
but 
that 
it 
has 
no 
price 
on 
the 
market, 
that 
its 
value 
cannot 
be 
realized 
in 
a 
market 
transaction 
and 
consequently 
cannot 
be 
expressed 
in 
terms 
of 
money. 


If 
we 
compare 
the 
conditions 
of 
two 
countries, 
say 
Atlantis 
and 
Thule, 
we 
can 
establish 
many 
important 
statistical 
figures 
of 
each 
of 
them: 
the 
size 
of 
the 
area 
and 
of 
the 
population, 
the 
birth 
rate 
and 
the 
death 
rate, 
the 
number 
of 
illiterates, 
of 
crimes 
committed, 
and 
many 
other 
demographical 
data. 
We 
can 
determine 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
money 
income 
of 
all 
its 
citizens, 
the 
money 
value 
of 
the 
yearly 
social 
product, 
the 
money 
value 
of 
the 
goods 
imported 
and 
exported, 
and 
many 
other 
economic 
data. 
But 
we 
cannot 
assign 
any 
arithmetical 
value 
to 
the 
system 
of 
government 
and 
administration. 
That 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
we 
deny 
the 
importance 
or 
the 
value 
of 
good 
government. 
It 
means 
only 
that 
no 
yardstick 
can 
measure 
these 
things. 
They 
are 
not 
liable 
to 
an 
expression 
in 
figures. 


It 
may 
well 
be 
that 
the 
greatest 
thing 
in 
Atlantis 
is 
its 
good 
system 
of 
government. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
Atlantis 
owes 
its 
prosperity 
to 
its 
constitutional 
and 
administrative 
institutions. 
But 
we 
cannot 
compare 
them 
with 
those 
of 
Thule 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
we 
can 
compare 
other 
things, 
for 
instance, 
wage 
rates 
or 
milk 
prices. 


Bureaucratic 
management 
is 
management 
of 
affairs 
which 
cannot 
be 
checked 
by 
economic 
calculation. 



4. 
THE 
CRUX 
OF 
BUREAUCRATIC 
MANAGEMENT 
The 
plain 
citizen 
compares 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
bureaus 
with 
the 
working 
of 
the 
profit 
system, 
which 
is 
more 
familiar 
to 
him. 
Then 
he 
discovers 
that 
bureaucratic 
management 
is 
wasteful, 
inefficient, 
slow, 
and 
rolled 
up 
in 
red 
tape. 
He 
simply 
cannot 
understand 
how 
reasonable 
people 
allow 
such 
a 
mischievous 
system 
to 
endure. 
Why 
not 
adopt 
the 
well-tried 
methods 
of 
private 
business? 


However, 
such 
criticisms 
are 
not 
sensible. 
They 
misconstrue 
the 
features 
peculiar 
to 
public 
administration. 
They 
are 
not 
aware 
of 
the 
fundamental 
difference 
between 
government 
and 
profit-seeking 
private 
enterprise. 
What 
they 
call 
deficiencies 
and 
faults 
of 
the 
management 
of 
administrative 
agencies 
are 
necessary 
properties. 
A 
bureau 
is 
not 
a 
profit-seeking 
enterprise; 
it 
cannot 
make 
use 
of 
any 
economic 
calculation; 
it 
has 
to 
solve 
problems 
which 
are 
unknown 
to 
business 
management. 
It 
is 
out 
of 
the 
question 
to 
improve 
its 
management 
by 
reshaping 
it 
according 
to 
the 
pattern 
of 
private 
business. 
It 
is 
a 
mistake 
to 
judge 
the 
efficiency 
of 
a 
government 
department 
by 
comparing 
it 
with 
the 
working 
of 
an 
enterprise 
subject 
to 
the 
interplay 
of 
market 
factors. 


There 
are, 
of 
course, 
in 
every 
country’s 
public 
administration 
manifest 
shortcomings 
which 
strike 
the 
eye 
of 
every 
observer. 
People 
are 
sometimes 
shocked 
by 
the 
degree 
of 
maladministration. 
But 
if 
one 
tries 
to 
go 
to 
their 
roots, 
one 
often 
learns 
that 
they 
are 
not 
simply 
the 
result 
of 
culpable 
negligence 
or 
lack 
of 
competence. 
They 
sometimes 
turn 
out 
to 
be 
the 
result 
of 
special 
political 
and 
institutional 
conditions 
or 
of 
an 
attempt 
to 
come 
to 
an 
arrangement 
with 
a 
problem 
for 
which 
a 
more 
satisfactory 
solution 
could 
not 
be 
found. 
A 
detailed 
scrutiny 
of 
all 
the 
difficulties 
involved 
may 
convince 
an 
honest 
investigator 
that, 
given 
the 
general 
state 
of 
political 
forces, 
he 
himself 
would 
not 
have 
known 
how 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
matter 
in 
a 
less 
objectionable 
way. 


It 
is 
vain 
to 
advocate 
a 
bureaucratic 
reform 
through 
the 
appointment 
of 



businessmen 
as 
heads 
of 
various 
departments. 
The 
quality 
of 
being 
an 
entrepreneur 
is 
not 
inherent 
in 
the 
personality 
of 
the 
entrepreneur; 
it 
is 
inherent 
in 
the 
position 
which 
he 
occupies 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
market 
society. 
A 
former 
entrepreneur 
who 
is 
given 
charge 
of 
a 
government 
bureau 
is 
in 
this 
capacity 
no 
longer 
a 
businessman 
but 
a 
bureaucrat. 
His 
objective 
can 
no 
longer 
be 
profit, 
but 
compliance 
with 
the 
rules 
and 
regulations. 
As 
head 
of 
a 
bureau 
he 
may 
have 
the 
power 
to 
alter 
some 
minor 
rules 
and 
some 
matters 
of 
internal 
procedure. 
But 
the 
setting 
of 
the 
bureau’s 
activities 
is 
determined 
by 
rules 
and 
regulations 
which 
are 
beyond 
his 
reach. 


It 
is 
a 
widespread 
illusion 
that 
the 
efficiency 
of 
government 
bureaus 
could 
be 
improved 
by 
management 
engineers 
and 
their 
methods 
of 
scientific 
management. 
However, 
such 
plans 
stem 
from 
a 
radical 
misconstruction 
of 
the 
objectives 
of 
civil 
government. 


Like 
any 
kind 
of 
engineering, 
management 
engineering 
too 
is 
conditioned 
by 
the 
availability 
of 
a 
method 
of 
calculation. 
Such 
a 
method 
exists 
in 
profit-
seeking 
business. 
Here 
the 
profit-and-loss 
statement 
is 
supreme. 
The 
problem 
of 
bureaucratic 
management 
is 
precisely 
the 
absence 
of 
such 
a 
method 
of 
calculation. 


In 
the 
field 
of 
profit-seeking 
enterprise 
the 
objective 
of 
the 
management 
engineer’s 
activities 
is 
clearly 
determined 
by 
the 
primacy 
of 
the 
profit 
motive. 
His 
task 
is 
to 
reduce 
costs 
without 
impairing 
the 
market 
value 
of 
the 
result 
or 
to 
reduce 
costs 
more 
than 
the 
ensuing 
reduction 
of 
the 
market 
value 
of 
the 
result 
or 
to 
raise 
the 
market 
value 
of 
the 
result 
more 
than 
the 
required 
rise 
in 
costs. 
But 
in 
the 
field 
of 
government 
the 
result 
has 
no 
price 
on 
a 
market. 
It 
can 
neither 
be 
bought 
nor 
sold. 


Let 
us 
consider 
three 
examples. 


A 
police 
department 
has 
the 
job 
of 
protecting 
a 
defense 
plant 
against 
sabotage. 
It 
assigns 
thirty 
patrolmen 
to 
this 
duty. 
The 
responsible 
commissioner 
does 
not 
need 
the 
advice 
of 
an 
efficiency 
expert 
in 
order 
to 
discover 
that 
he 
could 
save 
money 
by 
reducing 
the 
guard 
to 
only 
twenty 
men. 
But 
the 
question 
is: 
Does 
this 
economy 
outweigh 
the 
increase 
in 
risk? 
There 
are 
serious 
things 
at 
stake: 
national 
defense, 
the 
morale 
of 
the 
armed 
forces 
and 
of 
civilians, 
repercussions 
in 
the 
field 
of 
foreign 
affairs, 
the 
lives 
of 
many 



upright 
workers. 
All 
these 
valuable 
things 
cannot 
be 
assessed 
in 
terms 
of 
money. 
The 
responsibility 
rests 
entirely 
with 
Congress 
allocating 
the 
appropriations 
required 
and 
with 
the 
executive 
branch 
of 
the 
Government. 
They 
cannot 
evade 
it 
by 
leaving 
the 
decision 
to 
an 
irresponsible 
adviser. 


One 
of 
the 
tasks 
of 
the 
Bureau 
of 
Internal 
Revenue 
is 
the 
final 
determination 
of 
taxes 
due. 
Its 
duty 
is 
the 
interpretation 
and 
application 
of 
the 
law. 
This 
is 
not 
merely 
a 
clerical 
job; 
it 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
judicial 
function. 
Any 
taxpayer 
objecting 
to 
the 
Commissioner’s 
interpretation 
of 
the 
law 
is 
free 
to 
bring 
suit 
in 
a 
Federal 
court 
to 
recover 
the 
amount 
paid. 
Of 
what 
use 
can 
the 
efficiency 
engineer 
with 
his 
time 
and 
motion 
studies 
be 
for 
the 
conduct 
of 
these 
affairs? 
His 
stop 
watch 
would 
be 
in 
the 
wrong 
place 
in 
the 
office 
rooms 
of 
the 
bureau. 
It 
is 
obvious 
that?other 
things 
being 
equal?a 
clerk 
who 
works 
more 
quickly 
is 
a 
more 
desirable 
employee 
than 
another 
who 
is 
slower. 
But 
the 
main 
problem 
is 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
performance. 
Only 
the 
experienced 
senior 
clerks 
are 
in 
a 
position 
to 
appreciate 
duly 
the 
achievements 
of 
their 
aides. 
Intellectual 
work 
cannot 
be 
measured 
and 
valued 
by 
mechanical 
devices. 


Let 
us 
finally 
consider 
an 
instance 
in 
which 
neither 
problems 
of 
“higher” 
politics 
nor 
those 
of 
the 
correct 
application 
of 
the 
law 
are 
involved. 
A 
bureau 
is 
in 
charge 
of 
buying 
all 
the 
supplies 
needed 
for 
the 
technical 
conduct 
of 
office 
work. 
This 
is 
a 
comparatively 
simple 
job. 
But 
it 
is 
by 
no 
means 
a 
mechanical 
job. 
The 
best 
clerk 
is 
not 
he 
who 
fills 
out 
the 
greatest 
number 
of 
orders 
in 
an 
hour. 
The 
most 
satisfactory 
performance 
is 
to 
buy 
the 
most 
appropriate 
materials 
at 
the 
cheapest 
price. 


It 
is 
therefore, 
as 
far 
as 
the 
management 
of 
government 
is 
concerned, 
not 
correct 
to 
assert 
that 
time 
study, 
motion 
study, 
and 
other 
tools 
of 
scientific 
management 
“show 
with 
reasonable 
accuracy 
how 
much 
time 
and 
effort 
are 
required 
for 
each 
of 
the 
available 
methods” 
and 
that 
they 
therefore 
“can 
show 
which 
of 
the 
possible 
methods 
and 
procedures 
require 
the 
least 
time 
and 
effort.”2 
All 
such 
things 
are 
quite 
useless 
because 
they 
cannot 
be 
coördinated 
to 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
work 
done. 
Speed 
alone 
is 
not 
a 
measure 
of 
intellectual 
work. 
You 
cannot 
“measure” 
a 
doctor 
according 
to 
the 
time 
he 
employs 
in 
examining 
one 
case. 
And 
you 
cannot 
“measure” 
a 
judge 
according 
to 
the 
time 
he 
needs 
to 
adjudicate 
one 
case. 


If 
a 
businessman 
manufactures 
some 
article 
destined 
for 
export 
into 
foreign 



countries, 
he 
is 
eager 
to 
reduce 
the 
man-hours 
spent 
for 
the 
production 
of 
the 
various 
parts 
of 
the 
commodity 
in 
question. 
But 
the 
license 
required 
for 
shipping 
this 
commodity 
abroad 
is 
not 
a 
part 
of 
the 
commodity. 
The 
government 
in 
issuing 
a 
license 
does 
not 
contribute 
anything 
to 
the 
production, 
the 
marketing, 
and 
the 
shipping 
of 
this 
commodity. 
Its 
bureau 
is 
not 
a 
workshop 
turning 
out 
one 
of 
the 
parts 
needed 
for 
the 
finishing 
of 
the 
product. 
What 
the 
government 
aims 
at 
in 
making 
exports 
depend 
on 
the 
grant 
of 
a 
license 
is 
restraint 
of 
export 
trade. 
It 
wants 
to 
reduce 
the 
total 
volume 
of 
exports 
or 
the 
volume 
exported 
by 
undesirable 
exporters 
or 
sold 
to 
undesirable 
buyers. 
The 
issuance 
of 
licenses 
is 
not 
the 
objective 
but 
a 
technical 
device 
for 
its 
attainment. 
From 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
government 
the 
licenses 
refused 
or 
not 
even 
applied 
for 
are 
more 
important 
than 
those 
granted. 
It 
would 
therefore 
not 
be 
to 
the 
purpose 
to 
take 
“the 
total 
man-hours 
spent 
per 
license” 
as 
the 
standard 
of 
the 
bureau’s 
performance. 
It 
would 
be 
unsuitable 
to 
perform 
“the 
operation 
of 
processing 
the 
licenses 
… 
on 
an 
assembly 
line 
basis.”3 


There 
are 
other 
differences. 
If 
in 
the 
course 
of 
a 
manufacturing 
process 
a 
piece 
gets 
spoiled 
or 
lost, 
the 
result 
is 
a 
precisely 
limited 
increase 
in 
production 
costs. 
But 
if 
a 
license 
application 
is 
lost 
in 
the 
bureau, 
serious 
damage 
may 
be 
inflicted 
upon 
a 
citizen. 
The 
law 
may 
prevent 
the 
individual 
harmed 
from 
suing 
the 
bureau 
for 
indemnification. 
But 
the 
political 
and 
moral 
liability 
of 
the 
government 
to 
deal 
with 
these 
applications 
in 
a 
very 
careful 
way 
remains 
nonetheless. 


The 
conduct 
of 
government 
affairs 
is 
as 
different 
from 
the 
industrial 
processes 
as 
is 
prosecuting, 
convicting, 
and 
sentencing 
a 
murderer 
from 
the 
growing 
of 
corn 
or 
the 
manufacturing 
of 
shoes. 
Government 
efficiency 
and 
industrial 
efficiency 
are 
entirely 
different 
things. 
A 
factory’s 
management 
cannot 
be 
improved 
by 
taking 
a 
police 
department 
for 
its 
model, 
and 
a 
tax 
collector’s 
office 
cannot 
become 
more 
efficient 
by 
adopting 
the 
methods 
of 
a 
motor-car 
plant. 
Lenin 
was 
mistaken 
in 
holding 
up 
the 
government’s 
bureaus 
as 
a 
pattern 
for 
industry. 
But 
those 
who 
want 
to 
make 
the 
management 
of 
the 
bureaus 
equal 
to 
that 
of 
the 
factories 
are 
no 
less 
mistaken. 


There 
are 
many 
things 
about 
government 
administration 
which 
need 
to 
be 
reformed. 
Of 
course, 
all 
human 
institutions 
must 
again 
and 
again 
be 
adjusted 



anew 
to 
the 
change 
of 
conditions. 
But 
no 
reform 
could 
transform 
a 
public 
office 
into 
a 
sort 
of 
private 
enterprise. 
A 
government 
is 
not 
a 
profit-seeking 
enterprise. 
The 
conduct 
of 
its 
affairs 
cannot 
be 
checked 
by 
profit-and-loss 
statements. 
Its 
achievement 
cannot 
be 
valued 
in 
terms 
of 
money. 
This 
is 
fundamental 
for 
any 
treatment 
of 
the 
problems 
of 
bureaucracy. 



5. 
BUREAUCRATIC 
PERSONNEL 
MANAGEMENT 
A 
bureaucrat 
differs 
from 
a 
nonbureaucrat 
precisely 
because 
he 
is 
working 
in 
a 
field 
in 
which 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
appraise 
the 
result 
of 
a 
man’s 
effort 
in 
terms 
of 
money. 
The 
nation 
spends 
money 
for 
the 
upkeep 
of 
the 
bureaus, 
for 
the 
payment 
of 
salaries 
and 
wages, 
and 
for 
the 
purchase 
of 
all 
the 
equipment 
and 
materials 
needed. 
But 
what 
it 
gets 
for 
the 
expenditure, 
the 
service 
rendered, 
cannot 
be 
appraised 
in 
terms 
of 
money, 
however 
important 
and 
valuable 
this 
“output” 
may 
be. 
Its 
appraisal 
depends 
on 
the 
discretion 
of 
the 
government. 


It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
appraisal 
of 
the 
various 
commodities 
sold 
and 
bought 
on 
the 
market 
depends 
no 
less 
on 
discretion, 
that 
is, 
on 
the 
discretion 
of 
the 
consumers. 
But 
as 
the 
consumers 
are 
a 
vast 
body 
of 
different 
people, 
an 
anonymous 
and 
amorphous 
aggregation, 
the 
judgments 
they 
pass 
are 
congealed 
into 
an 
impersonal 
phenomenon, 
the 
market 
price, 
and 
are 
thus 
severed 
from 
their 
arbitrary 
origin. 
Moreover, 
they 
refer 
to 
commodities 
and 
services 
as 
such, 
not 
to 
their 
performers. 
The 
seller-buyer 
nexus 
as 
well 
as 
the 
employer-employee 
relation, 
in 
profit-seeking 
business 
are 
purely 
matter 
of 
fact 
and 
impersonal. 
It 
is 
a 
deal 
from 
which 
both 
parties 
derive 
an 
advantage. 
They 
mutually 
contribute 
to 
each 
other’s 
living. 
But 
it 
is 
different 
with 
a 
bureaucratic 
organization. 
There 
the 
nexus 
between 
superior 
and 
subordinate 
is 
personal. 
The 
subordinate 
depends 
on 
the 
superior’s 
judgment 
of 
his 
personality, 
not 
of 
his 
work. 
As 
long 
as 
the 
office 
clerk 
can 
rely 
on 
his 
chances 
of 
getting 
a 
job 
with 
private 
business, 
this 
dependence 
cannot 
become 
so 
oppressive 
as 
to 
mark 
the 
clerk’s 
whole 
character. 
But 
it 
is 
different 
under 
the 
present 
trend 
toward 
general 
bureaucratization. 


The 
American 
scene 
until 
a 
few 
years 
ago 
did 
not 
know 
the 
bureaucrat 
as 
a 
particular 
type 
of 
human 
being. 
There 
were 
always 
bureaus 
and 
they 
were, 
by 
necessity, 
operated 
in 
a 
bureaucratic 
way. 
But 
there 
was 
no 
numerous 
class 
of 
men 
who 
considered 
work 
in 
the 
public 
offices 
their 
exclusive 
calling. 
There 
was 
a 
continuous 
change 
of 
personnel 
between 
government 
jobs 
and 
private 
jobs. 
Under 
civil 
service 
provisions 
public 
service 
became 
a 
regular 
career. 



Appointments 
were 
based 
on 
examinations 
and 
no 
longer 
depended 
on 
the 
political 
affiliation 
of 
the 
applicants. 
Many 
remained 
in 
public 
bureaus 
for 
life. 
But 
they 
retained 
their 
personal 
independence 
because 
they 
could 
always 
consider 
a 
return 
to 
private 
jobs. 


It 
was 
different 
in 
continental 
Europe. 
There 
the 
bureaucrats 
have 
long 
formed 
an 
integrated 
group. 
Only 
for 
a 
few 
eminent 
men 
was 
a 
return 
to 
nonofficial 
life 
practically 
open. 
The 
majority 
were 
tied 
up 
with 
the 
bureaus 
for 
life. 
They 
developed 
a 
character 
peculiar 
to 
their 
permanent 
removal 
from 
the 
world 
of 
profit-seeking 
business. 
Their 
intellectual 
horizon 
was 
the 
hierarchy 
and 
its 
rules 
and 
regulations. 
Their 
fate 
was 
to 
depend 
entirely 
on 
the 
favor 
of 
their 
superiors. 
They 
were 
subject 
to 
their 
sway 
not 
only 
when 
on 
duty. 
It 
was 
understood 
that 
their 
private 
activities 
also?and 
even 
those 
of 
their 
wives?had 
to 
be 
appropriate 
to 
the 
dignity 
of 
their 
position 
and 
to 
a 
special?unwritten?code 
of 
conduct 
becoming 
to 
a 
Staatsbeamter 
or 
fonctionnaire. 
It 
was 
expected 
that 
they 
would 
endorse 
the 
political 
viewpoint 
of 
the 
cabinet 
ministers 
who 
happened 
at 
the 
time 
to 
be 
in 
office. 
At 
any 
rate 
their 
freedom 
to 
support 
a 
party 
of 
opposition 
was 
sensibly 
curtailed. 


The 
emergence 
of 
a 
large 
class 
of 
such 
men 
dependent 
on 
the 
government 
became 
a 
serious 
menace 
to 
the 
maintenance 
of 
constitutional 
institutions. 
Attempts 
were 
made 
to 
protect 
the 
individual 
clerk 
against 
arbitrariness 
on 
the 
part 
of 
his 
superiors. 
But 
the 
only 
result 
achieved 
was 
that 
discipline 
was 
relaxed 
and 
that 
looseness 
in 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
duties 
spread 
more 
and 
more. 


America 
is 
a 
novice 
in 
the 
field 
of 
bureaucracy. 
It 
has 
much 
less 
experience 
in 
this 
matter 
than 
the 
classical 
countries 
of 
bureaucracy, 
France, 
Germany, 
Austria, 
and 
Russia, 
acquired. 
In 
the 
United 
States 
there 
still 
prevails 
a 
leaning 
toward 
an 
overvaluation 
of 
the 
usefulness 
of 
civil-service 
regulations. 
Such 
regulations 
require 
that 
the 
applicants 
be 
a 
certain 
age, 
graduate 
from 
certain 
schools, 
and 
pass 
certain 
examinations. 
For 
promotion 
to 
higher 
ranks 
and 
higher 
salary 
a 
certain 
number 
of 
years 
spent 
in 
the 
lower 
ranks 
and 
the 
passing 
of 
further 
examinations 
are 
required. 
It 
is 
obvious 
that 
all 
such 
requirements 
refer 
to 
things 
more 
or 
less 
superficial. 
There 
is 
no 
need 
to 
point 
out 
that 
school 
attendance, 
examinations, 
and 
years 
spent 
in 
the 
lower 
positions 
do 
not 
necessarily 
qualify 
a 
man 
for 
a 
higher 
job. 
This 
machinery 



for 
selection 
sometimes 
bars 
the 
most 
competent 
men 
from 
a 
job 
and 
does 
not 
always 
prevent 
the 
appointment 
of 
an 
utter 
incompetent. 
But 
the 
worst 
effect 
produced 
is 
that 
the 
main 
concern 
of 
the 
clerks 
is 
to 
comply 
with 
these 
and 
other 
formalities. 
They 
forget 
that 
their 
job 
is 
to 
perform 
an 
assigned 
duty 
as 
well 
as 
possible. 


In 
a 
properly 
arranged 
civil-service 
system 
the 
promotion 
to 
higher 
ranks 
depends 
primarily 
on 
seniority. 
The 
heads 
of 
the 
bureaus 
are 
for 
the 
most 
part 
old 
men 
who 
know 
that 
after 
a 
few 
years 
they 
will 
be 
retired. 
Having 
spent 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
their 
lives 
in 
subordinate 
positions, 
they 
have 
lost 
vigor 
and 
initiative. 
They 
shun 
innovations 
and 
improvements. 
They 
look 
on 
every 
project 
for 
reform 
as 
a 
disturbance 
of 
their 
quiet. 
Their 
rigid 
conservatism 
frustrates 
all 
endeavors 
of 
a 
cabinet 
minister 
to 
adjust 
the 
service 
to 
changed 
conditions. 
They 
look 
down 
upon 
the 
cabinet 
minister 
as 
an 
inexperienced 
layman. 
In 
all 
countries 
with 
a 
settled 
bureaucracy 
people 
used 
to 
say: 
The 
cabinets 
come 
and 
go, 
but 
the 
bureaus 
remain. 


It 
would 
be 
a 
mistake 
to 
ascribe 
the 
frustration 
of 
European 
bureaucratism 
to 
intellectual 
and 
moral 
deficiencies 
of 
the 
personnel. 
In 
all 
these 
countries 
there 
were 
many 
good 
families 
whose 
scions 
chose 
the 
bureaucratic 
career 
because 
they 
were 
honestly 
intent 
on 
serving 
their 
nation. 
The 
ideal 
of 
a 
bright 
poor 
boy 
who 
wanted 
to 
attain 
a 
better 
station 
in 
life 
was 
to 
join 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
administration. 
Many 
of 
the 
most 
gifted 
and 
lofty 
members 
of 
the 
intelligentsia 
served 
in 
the 
bureaus. 
The 
prestige 
and 
the 
social 
standing 
of 
the 
government 
clerks 
surpassed 
by 
far 
those 
of 
any 
other 
class 
of 
the 
population 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
army 
officers 
and 
the 
members 
of 
the 
oldest 
and 
wealthiest 
aristocratic 
families. 


Many 
civil 
servants 
published 
excellent 
treatises 
dealing 
with 
the 
problems 
of 
administrative 
law 
and 
statistics. 
Some 
of 
them 
were 
in 
their 
leisure 
hours 
brilliant 
writers 
or 
musicians. 
Others 
entered 
the 
field 
of 
politics 
and 
became 
eminent 
party 
leaders. 
Of 
course, 
the 
bulk 
of 
the 
bureaucrats 
were 
rather 
mediocre 
men. 
But 
it 
cannot 
be 
doubted 
that 
a 
considerable 
number 
of 
able 
men 
were 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
ranks 
of 
the 
government 
employees. 


The 
failure 
of 
European 
bureaucracy 
was 
certainly 
not 
due 
to 
incapacities 
of 
the 
personnel. 
It 
was 
an 
outcome 
of 
the 
unavoidable 
weakness 
of 
any 
administration 
of 
public 
affairs. 
The 
lack 
of 
standards 
which 
could, 
in 
an 



unquestionable 
way, 
ascertain 
success 
or 
nonsuccess 
in 
the 
performance 
of 
an 
official’s 
duties 
creates 
insoluble 
problems. 
It 
kills 
ambition, 
destroys 
initiative 
and 
the 
incentive 
to 
do 
more 
than 
the 
minimum 
required. 
It 
makes 
the 
bureaucrat 
look 
at 
instructions, 
not 
at 
material 
and 
real 
success.

This 
is 
not 
a 
definition 
of 
democratic 
government 
but 
a 
description 
of 
the 
administrative 
technique 
of 
democratic 
government. 
The 
definition 
of 
democratic 
government 
is: 
A 
system 
of 
government 
under 
which 
those 
ruled 
are 
in 
a 
position 
to 
determine, 
directly 
by 
plebiscite 
or 
indirectly 
by 
election, 
the 
exercise 
of 
the 
legislative 
and 
executive 
power 
and 
the 
selection 
of 
the 
supreme 
executives.

BUREAUCRATIC 
MANAGEMENT 
OF 
PUBLICLY 
OWNED 
ENTERPRISES 



1. 
THE 
IMPRACTICABILITY 
OF 
GOVERNMENT 
ALL-ROUND 
CONTROL 
SOCIALISM, 
that 
is, 
full 
government 
control 
of 
all 
economic 
activities, 
is 
impracticable 
because 
a 
socialist 
community 
would 
lack 
the 
indispensable 
intellectual 
instrument 
of 
economic 
planning 
and 
designing: 
economic 
calculation. 
The 
very 
idea 
of 
central 
planning 
by 
the 
state 
is 
self-
contradictory. 
A 
socialist 
central 
board 
of 
production 
management 
will 
be 
helpless 
in 
the 
face 
of 
the 
problems 
to 
be 
solved. 
It 
will 
never 
know 
whether 
the 
projects 
considered 
are 
advantageous 
or 
whether 
their 
performance 
would 
not 
bring 
about 
a 
waste 
of 
the 
means 
available. 
Socialism 
must 
result 
in 
complete 
chaos. 


The 
recognition 
of 
this 
truth 
has 
for 
many 
years 
been 
prevented 
by 
the 
taboos 
of 
Marxism. 
One 
of 
Marxism’s 
main 
contributions 
to 
the 
success 
of 
pro-
socialist 
propaganda 
was 
to 
outlaw 
the 
study 
of 
the 
economic 
problems 
of 
a 
socialist 
commonwealth. 
Such 
studies 
were 
in 
the 
opinion 
of 
Karl 
Marx 
and 
his 
sect 
the 
mark 
of 
an 
illusory 
“utopianism.” 
“Scientific” 
socialism, 
as 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
called 
their 
own 
brand, 
must 
not 
indulge 
in 
such 
useless 
investigations. 
The 
“scientific” 
socialists 
have 
to 
satisfy 
themselves 
with 
the 
insight 
that 
socialism 
is 
bound 
to 
come 
and 
that 
it 
will 
transform 
the 
earth 
into 
a 
paradise. 
They 
must 
not 
be 
so 
preposterous 
as 
to 
ask 
how 
the 
socialist 
system 
will 
work. 


One 
of 
the 
most 
remarkable 
facts 
of 
the 
intellectual 
history 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
and 
early 
twentieth 
centuries 
is 
that 
this 
Marxian 
Verboten 
was 
strictly 
obeyed. 
The 
few 
economists 
who 
dared 
to 
defy 
it 
were 
disregarded 
and 
soon 
fell 
into 
oblivion. 
Only 
about 
twenty-five 
years 
ago 
the 
spell 
was 
broken. 
The 
impossibility 
of 
economic 
calculation 
under 
socialism 
was 
demonstrated 
in 
an 
irrefutable 
way. 


Of 
course, 
some 
stubborn 
Marxians 
raised 
objections. 
They 
could 
not 
help 
admitting 
that 
the 
problem 
of 
economic 
calculation 
was 
the 
most 
serious 



issue 
of 
socialism 
and 
that 
it 
was 
a 
scandal 
that 
the 
socialists 
in 
eighty 
years 
of 
fanatical 
propaganda 
wasted 
their 
time 
on 
trifles 
without 
divining 
in 
what 
the 
main 
problem 
consisted. 
But 
they 
assured 
their 
alarmed 
partisans 
that 
it 
would 
be 
easy 
to 
find 
a 
satisfactory 
solution. 
Indeed, 
various 
socialist 
professors 
and 
writers 
both 
in 
Russia 
and 
in 
the 
Western 
countries 
suggested 
schemes 
for 
an 
economic 
calculation 
under 
socialism. 
These 
schemes 
proved 
utterly 
spurious. 
It 
was 
not 
difficult 
for 
the 
economists 
to 
unmask 
their 
fallacies 
and 
contradictions. 
The 
socialists 
failed 
completely 
in 
their 
desperate 
attempts 
to 
reject 
the 
demonstration 
that 
no 
economic 
calculation 
is 
feasible 
in 
any 
system 
of 
socialism.1 


It 
is 
obvious 
that 
a 
socialist 
management 
also 
would 
aim 
at 
supplying 
the 
community 
with 
as 
many 
and 
as 
good 
commodities 
as 
can 
be 
produced 
under 
the 
existing 
conditions 
of 
the 
supply 
of 
factors 
of 
production 
and 
of 
technological 
knowledge. 
A 
socialist 
government 
too 
would 
be 
eager 
to 
use 
the 
available 
factors 
of 
production 
for 
producing 
those 
goods 
that, 
according 
to 
its 
opinion, 
are 
most 
urgently 
needed, 
and 
to 
forego 
the 
production 
of 
those 
goods 
which 
it 
considers 
less 
urgently 
needed. 
But 
the 
unfeasibility 
of 
economic 
calculation 
will 
make 
it 
impossible 
to 
find 
out 
which 
methods 
for 
the 
production 
of 
the 
goods 
needed 
are 
the 
most 
economical 
ones. 


The 
socialist 
governments 
of 
Russia 
and 
Germany 
are 
operating 
in 
a 
world 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
which 
still 
clings 
to 
a 
market 
economy. 
They 
thus 
are 
in 
a 
position 
to 
use 
for 
their 
economic 
calculation 
the 
prices 
established 
abroad. 
Only 
because 
they 
can 
refer 
to 
these 
prices 
are 
they 
able 
to 
calculate, 
to 
keep 
books 
and 
to 
make 
plans. 
It 
would 
be 
quite 
different 
if 
every 
nation 
were 
to 
adopt 
socialism. 
Then 
there 
would 
be 
no 
more 
prices 
for 
factors 
of 
production 
and 
economic 
calculation 
would 
be 
impossible.2 



2. 
PUBLIC 
ENTERPRISE 
WITHIN 
A 
MARKET 
ECONOMY 
The 
same 
is 
the 
case 
with 
enterprises 
owned 
and 
operated 
by 
the 
government 
or 
the 
municipalities 
of 
a 
country 
in 
which 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
economic 
activity 
is 
under 
the 
management 
of 
free 
enterprise. 
For 
them 
too 
economic 
calculation 
offers 
no 
difficulties. 


We 
do 
not 
need 
to 
ask 
whether 
or 
not 
it 
would 
be 
feasible 
to 
manage 
such 
government, 
state, 
and 
municipal 
enterprises 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
private 
enterprise. 
For 
it 
is 
a 
fact 
that 
as 
a 
rule 
the 
authorities 
are 
inclined 
to 
deviate 
from 
the 
profit 
system. 
They 
do 
not 
want 
to 
operate 
their 
enterprises 
from 
the 
viewpoint 
of 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
greatest 
possible 
profit. 
They 
consider 
the 
accomplishment 
of 
other 
tasks 
more 
important. 
They 
are 
ready 
to 
renounce 
profit 
or 
at 
least 
a 
part 
of 
profit 
or 
even 
to 
take 
a 
loss 
for 
the 
achievement 
of 
other 
ends. 


Whatever 
these 
other 
goals 
aimed 
at 
may 
be, 
the 
result 
of 
such 
a 
policy 
always 
amounts 
to 
subsidizing 
some 
people 
to 
the 
burden 
of 
others. 
If 
a 
government-owned 
enterprise 
operates 
at 
a 
loss 
or 
with 
a 
part 
only 
of 
the 
profit 
which 
it 
could 
attain 
if 
it 
were 
conducted 
solely 
according 
to 
the 
profit 
motive, 
the 
falling 
off 
affects 
the 
budget 
and 
thereby 
the 
taxpayers. 
If, 
for 
instance, 
a 
city-owned 
transportation 
system 
charges 
the 
customers 
so 
low 
a 
fare 
that 
the 
costs 
of 
the 
operation 
cannot 
be 
covered, 
the 
taxpayers 
are 
virtually 
subsidizing 
those 
riding 
the 
trains. 


But 
we 
need 
not, 
in 
a 
book 
dealing 
with 
the 
problems 
of 
bureaucracy, 
bother 
about 
these 
financial 
aspects. 
From 
our 
point 
of 
view 
another 
outcome 
is 
to 
be 
considered. 


As 
soon 
as 
an 
undertaking 
is 
no 
longer 
operated 
under 
the 
profit 
motive, 
other 
principles 
must 
be 
adopted 
for 
the 
conduct 
of 
its 
affairs. 
The 
city 
authorities 
cannot 
simply 
instruct 
the 
manager: 
Do 
not 
bother 
about 
a 
profit. 
They 
must 
give 
him 
more 
definite 
and 
precise 
orders. 
What 
kind 
of 
orders 
could 
these 
be? 



The 
champions 
of 
nationalized 
and 
municipalized 
enterprise 
are 
prone 
to 
answer 
this 
question 
in 
a 
rather 
naive 
manner: 
The 
public 
enterprise’s 
duty 
is 
to 
render 
useful 
services 
to 
the 
community. 
But 
the 
problem 
is 
not 
so 
simple 
as 
this. 
Every 
undertaking’s 
sole 
task 
is 
to 
render 
useful 
services. 
But 
what 
does 
this 
term 
mean? 
Who 
is, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
public 
enterprise, 
to 
decide 
whether 
a 
service 
is 
useful? 
And 
much 
more 
important: 
How 
do 
we 
find 
out 
whether 
the 
services 
rendered 
are 
not 
too 
heavily 
paid 
for, 
i.e., 
whether 
the 
factors 
of 
production 
absorbed 
by 
their 
performance 
are 
not 
withdrawn 
from 
other 
lines 
of 
utilization 
in 
which 
they 
could 
render 
more 
valuable 
services? 


With 
private 
profit-seeking 
enterprise 
this 
problem 
is 
solved 
by 
the 
attitudes 
of 
the 
public. 
The 
proof 
of 
the 
usefulness 
of 
the 
services 
rendered 
is 
that 
a 
sufficient 
number 
of 
citizens 
is 
ready 
to 
pay 
the 
price 
asked 
for 
them. 
There 
cannot 
be 
any 
doubt 
about 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
customers 
consider 
the 
services 
rendered 
by 
the 
bakeries 
useful. 
They 
are 
ready 
to 
pay 
the 
price 
asked 
for 
bread. 
Under 
this 
price 
the 
production 
of 
bread 
tends 
to 
expand 
until 
saturation 
is 
reached, 
that 
is, 
until 
a 
further 
expansion 
would 
withdraw 
factors 
of 
production 
from 
branches 
of 
industry 
for 
whose 
products 
the 
demand 
of 
the 
consumers 
is 
more 
intense. 
In 
taking 
the 
profit-motive 
as 
a 
guide, 
free 
enterprise 
adjusts 
its 
activities 
to 
the 
desires 
of 
the 
public. 
The 
profit-motive 
pushes 
every 
entrepreneur 
to 
accomplish 
those 
services 
that 
the 
consumers 
deem 
the 
most 
urgent. 
The 
price 
structure 
of 
the 
market 
tells 
them 
how 
free 
they 
are 
to 
invest 
in 
every 
branch 
of 
production. 


But 
if 
a 
public 
enterprise 
is 
to 
be 
operated 
without 
regard 
to 
profits, 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
public 
no 
longer 
provides 
a 
criterion 
of 
its 
usefulness. 
If 
the 
government 
or 
the 
municipal 
authorities 
are 
resolved 
to 
go 
on 
notwithstanding 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
operation 
costs 
are 
not 
made 
up 
by 
the 
payments 
received 
from 
the 
customers, 
where 
may 
a 
criterion 
be 
found 
of 
the 
usefulness 
of 
the 
services 
rendered? 
How 
can 
we 
find 
out 
whether 
the 
deficit 
is 
not 
too 
big 
with 
regard 
to 
these 
services? 
And 
how 
discover 
whether 
the 
deficit 
could 
not 
be 
reduced 
without 
impairing 
the 
value 
of 
the 
services? 


A 
private 
business 
is 
doomed 
if 
its 
operation 
brings 
losses 
only 
and 
no 
way 
can 
be 
found 
to 
remedy 
this 
situation. 
Its 
unprofitability 
is 
the 
proof 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
consumers 
disallow 
it. 
There 
is, 
with 
private 
enterprise, 
no 
means 
of 
defying 
this 
verdict 
of 
the 
public 
and 
of 
keeping 
on. 
The 
manager 



of 
a 
plant 
involving 
a 
loss 
may 
explain 
and 
excuse 
the 
failure. 
But 
such 
apologies 
are 
of 
no 
avail; 
they 
cannot 
prevent 
the 
final 
abandonment 
of 
the 
unsuccessful 
project. 


It 
is 
different 
with 
a 
public 
enterprise. 
Here 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
deficit 
is 
not 
considered 
a 
proof 
of 
failure. 
The 
manager 
is 
not 
responsible 
for 
it. 
It 
is 
the 
aim 
of 
his 
boss, 
the 
government, 
to 
sell 
at 
such 
a 
low 
price 
that 
a 
loss 
becomes 
unavoidable. 
But 
if 
the 
government 
were 
to 
limit 
its 
interference 
with 
the 
fixing 
of 
the 
sales 
prices 
and 
to 
leave 
everything 
else 
to 
the 
manager, 
it 
would 
give 
him 
full 
power 
to 
draw 
on 
the 
treasury’s 
funds. 


It 
is 
important 
to 
realize 
that 
our 
problem 
has 
nothing 
at 
all 
to 
do 
with 
the 
necessity 
of 
preventing 
the 
manager 
from 
the 
criminal 
abuse 
of 
his 
power. 
We 
assume 
that 
the 
government 
or 
the 
municipality 
has 
appointed 
an 
honest 
and 
efficient 
manager 
and 
that 
the 
moral 
climate 
of 
the 
country 
or 
city 
and 
the 
organization 
of 
the 
undertaking 
concerned 
offer 
a 
satisfactory 
protection 
against 
any 
felonious 
misprision. 
Our 
problem 
is 
quite 
different. 
It 
stems 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
every 
service 
can 
be 
improved 
by 
increasing 
expenditures. 
However 
excellent 
a 
hospital, 
subway 
system, 
or 
water 
works 
may 
be, 
the 
manager 
always 
knows 
how 
he 
could 
improve 
the 
service 
provided 
the 
funds 
required 
are 
available. 
In 
no 
field 
of 
human 
wants 
can 
full 
satisfaction 
be 
reached 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
no 
further 
improvement 
is 
possible. 
The 
specialists 
are 
intent 
upon 
improving 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
needs 
only 
in 
their 
special 
branches 
of 
activity. 
They 
do 
not 
and 
cannot 
bother 
about 
the 
check 
which 
an 
expansion 
of 
the 
plant 
entrusted 
to 
them 
would 
impose 
upon 
other 
classes 
of 
need-satisfaction. 
It 
is 
not 
the 
task 
of 
the 
hospital 
director 
to 
renounce 
some 
improvement 
of 
the 
municipal 
hospital 
lest 
it 
impede 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
subway 
system 
or 
vice 
versa. 
It 
is 
precisely 
the 
efficient 
and 
honest 
manager 
who 
will 
try 
to 
make 
the 
services 
of 
his 
outfit 
as 
good 
as 
possible. 
But 
as 
he 
is 
not 
restrained 
by 
any 
considerations 
of 
financial 
success, 
the 
costs 
involved 
would 
place 
a 
heavy 
burden 
on 
the 
public 
funds. 
He 
would 
become 
a 
sort 
of 
irresponsible 
spender 
of 
the 
taxpayers’ 
money. 
As 
this 
is 
out 
of 
the 
question, 
the 
government 
must 
give 
attention 
to 
many 
details 
of 
the 
management. 
It 
must 
define 
in 
a 
precise 
way 
the 
quality 
and 
the 
quantity 
of 
the 
services 
to 
be 
rendered 
and 
the 
commodities 
to 
be 
sold, 
it 
must 
issue 
detailed 
instructions 
concerning 
the 
methods 
to 
be 
applied 
in 
the 
purchase 
of 
material 
factors 
of 
production 
and 
in 
hiring 
and 
rewarding 
labor. 



As 
the 
account 
of 
profit 
or 
loss 
is 
not 
to 
be 
considered 
the 
criterion 
of 
the 
management’s 
success 
or 
failure, 
the 
only 
means 
to 
make 
the 
manager 
responsible 
to 
the 
boss, 
the 
treasury, 
is 
to 
limit 
his 
discretion 
by 
rules 
and 
regulations. 
If 
he 
believes 
that 
it 
is 
expedient 
to 
spend 
more 
than 
these 
instructions 
allow, 
he 
must 
make 
an 
application 
for 
a 
special 
allotment 
of 
money. 
In 
this 
case 
the 
decision 
rests 
with 
his 
boss, 
the 
government, 
or 
the 
municipality. 
At 
any 
rate 
the 
manager 
is 
not 
a 
business 
executive 
but 
a 
bureaucrat, 
that 
is, 
an 
officer 
bound 
to 
abide 
by 
various 
instructions. 
The 
criterion 
of 
good 
management 
is 
not 
the 
approval 
of 
the 
customers 
resulting 
in 
an 
excess 
of 
revenue 
over 
costs 
but 
the 
strict 
obedience 
to 
a 
set 
of 
bureaucratic 
rules. 
The 
supreme 
rule 
of 
management 
is 
subservience 
to 
such 
rules. 


Of 
course, 
the 
government 
or 
the 
town 
council 
will 
be 
eager 
to 
draft 
these 
rules 
and 
regulations 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
the 
services 
rendered 
become 
as 
useful 
as 
they 
want 
them 
to 
be 
and 
the 
deficit 
not 
higher 
than 
they 
want 
to 
have 
it. 
But 
this 
does 
not 
remove 
the 
bureaucratic 
character 
of 
the 
conduct 
of 
affairs. 
The 
management 
is 
under 
the 
necessity 
of 
abiding 
by 
a 
code 
of 
instructions; 
this 
alone 
matters. 
The 
manager 
is 
not 
answerable 
if 
his 
actions 
are 
correct 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
this 
code. 
His 
main 
task 
cannot 
be 
efficiency 
as 
such, 
but 
efficiency 
within 
the 
limits 
of 
subservience 
to 
the 
regulations. 
His 
position 
is 
not 
that 
of 
an 
executive 
in 
a 
profit-seeking 
enterprise 
but 
that 
of 
a 
civil 
servant, 
for 
instance, 
the 
head 
of 
a 
police 
department. 


The 
only 
alternative 
to 
profit-seeking 
business 
is 
bureaucratic 
management. 
It 
would 
be 
utterly 
impracticable 
to 
delegate 
to 
any 
individual 
or 
group 
of 
individuals 
the 
power 
to 
draw 
freely 
on 
public 
funds. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
curb 
the 
power 
of 
the 
managers

BUREAUCRATIC 
MANAGEMENT 
OF 
PRIVATE 
ENTERPRISES 


1. 
HOW 
GOVERNMENT 
INTERFERENCE 
AND 
THE 
IMPAIRMENT 
OF 
THE 
PROFIT 
MOTIVE 
DRIVE 
BUSINESS 
TOWARD 
BUREAUCRATIZATION 
NO 
private 
enterprise 
will 
ever 
fall 
prey 
to 
bureaucratic 
methods 
of 
management 
if 
it 
is 
operated 
with 
the 
sole 
aim 
of 
making 
profit. 
It 
has 
already 
been 
pointed 
out 
that 
under 
the 
profit 
motive 
every 
industrial 
aggregate, 
no 
matter 
how 
big 
it 
may 
be, 
is 
in 
a 
position 
to 
organize 
its 
whole 
business 
and 
each 
part 
of 
it 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
the 
spirit 
of 
capitalist 
acquisitiveness 
permeates 
it 
from 
top 
to 
bottom. 


But 
ours 
is 
an 
age 
of 
a 
general 
attack 
on 
the 
profit 
motive. 
Public 
opinion 
condemns 
it 
as 
highly 
immoral 
and 
extremely 
detrimental 
to 
the 
commonweal. 
Political 
parties 
and 
governments 
are 
anxious 
to 
remove 
it 
and 
to 
put 
in 
its 
place 
what 
they 
call 
the 
“service” 
point 
of 
view 
and 
what 
is 
in 
fact 
bureaucratic 
management. 


We 
do 
not 
need 
to 
deal 
in 
detail 
with 
what 
the 
Nazis 
have 
achieved 
in 
this 
regard. 
The 
Nazis 
have 
succeeded 
in 
entirely 
eliminating 
the 
profit 
motive 
from 
the 
conduct 
of 
business. 
In 
Nazi 
Germany 
there 
is 
no 
longer 
any 
question 
of 
free 
enterprise. 
There 
are 
no 
more 
entrepreneurs. 
The 
former 
entrepreneurs 
have 
been 
reduced 
to 
the 
status 
of 
Betriebsführer 
(shop 
manager). 
They 
are 
not 
free 
in 
their 
operation; 
they 
are 
bound 
to 
obey 



unconditionally 
the 
orders 
issued 
by 
the 
Central 
Board 
of 
Production 
Management, 
the 
Reichswirtschaftsministerium, 
and 
its 
subordinate 
district 
and 
branch 
offices. 
The 
government 
not 
only 
determines 
the 
prices 
and 
interest 
rates 
to 
be 
paid 
and 
to 
be 
asked, 
the 
height 
of 
wages 
and 
salaries, 
the 
amount 
to 
be 
produced 
and 
the 
methods 
to 
be 
applied 
in 
production; 
it 
allots 
a 
definite 
income 
to 
every 
shop 
manager, 
thus 
virtually 
transforming 
him 
into 
a 
salaried 
civil 
servant. 
This 
system 
has, 
but 
for 
the 
use 
of 
some 
terms, 
nothing 
in 
common 
with 
capitalism 
and 
a 
market 
economy. 
It 
is 
simply 
socialism 
of 
the 
German 
pattern, 
Zwangswirtschaft. 
It 
differs 
from 
the 
Russian 
pattern 
of 
socialism, 
the 
system 
of 
outright 
nationalization 
of 
all 
plants, 
only 
in 
technical 
matters. 
And 
it 
is, 
of 
course, 
like 
the 
Russian 
system, 
a 
mode 
of 
social 
organization 
that 
is 
purely 
authoritarian. 


In 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
world 
things 
have 
not 
gone 
as 
far 
as 
that. 
In 
the 
Anglo-
Saxon 
countries 
there 
is 
still 
private 
enterprise. 
But 
the 
general 
tendency 
of 
our 
time 
is 
to 
let 
the 
government 
interfere 
with 
private 
business. 
And 
this 
interference 
in 
many 
instances 
forces 
upon 
the 
private 
enterprise 
bureaucratic 
management. 



2. 
INTERFERENCE 
WITH 
THE 
HEIGHT 
OF 
PROFIT 
The 
government 
may 
apply 
various 
methods 
in 
order 
to 
restrict 
the 
profits 
which 
an 
enterprise 
is 
free 
to 
earn. 
The 
most 
frequent 
methods 
are: 


The 
profits 
that 
a 
special 
class 
of 
undertakings 
is 
free 
to 
make 
are 
limited. 
A 
surplus 
is 
either 
to 
be 
handed 
over 
to 
the 
authority 
(for 
instance, 
the 
city) 
or 
to 
be 
distributed 
as 
a 
bonus 
to 
the 
employees 
or 
it 
must 
be 
eliminated 
by 
a 
reduction 
of 
the 
rates 
or 
prices 
charged 
to 
the 
customers. 


The 
authority 
is 
free 
to 
determine 
the 
prices 
or 
rates 
that 
the 
enterprise 
is 
entitled 
to 
charge 
for 
the 
commodities 
sold 
or 
the 
services 
rendered. 
It 
uses 
this 
power 
for 
the 
prevention 
of 
what 
it 
calls 
excessive 
profits. 


The 
enterprise 
is 
not 
free 
to 
charge 
more 
for 
commodities 
sold 
and 
services 
rendered 
than 
its 
actual 
costs 
plus 
an 
additional 
amount 
determined 
by 
the 
authority 
either 
as 
a 
percentage 
of 
the 
costs 
or 
as 
a 
fixed 
fee. 


The 
enterprise 
is 
free 
to 
earn 
as 
much 
as 
market 
conditions 
allow; 
but 
taxes 
absorb 
all 
profit 
or 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
it 
above 
a 
certain 
amount. 


What 
is 
common 
to 
all 
these 
instances 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
enterprise 
is 
no 
longer 
interested 
in 
increasing 
its 
profits. 
It 
loses 
the 
incentive 
to 
lower 
costs 
and 
to 
do 
its 
job 
as 
(efficiently 
and 
as 
cheaply 
as 
possible. 
But 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
all 
the 
checks 
on 
improvements 
in 
the 
procedures 
and 
on 
attempts 
to 
reduce 
costs 
remain. 
The 
risks 
connected 
with 
the 
adoption 
of 
new 
cost 
saving 
devices 
fall 
upon 
the 
entrepreneur. 
The 
disagreements 
involved 
in 
resisting 
the 
demand 
of 
the 
employees 
for 
higher 
wages 
and 
salaries 
are 
left 
to 
him. 


Public 
opinion, 
biased 
by 
the 
spurious 
fables 
of 
the 
socialists, 
is 
rash 
in 
blaming 
the 
entrepreneurs. 
It 
is, 
we 
are 
told, 
their 
immorality 
that 
results 
in 
the 
lowering 
of 
efficiency. 
If 
they 
were 
as 
conscientious 
and 
devoted 
to 
the 
promotion 
of 
public 
welfare 
as 
the 
unselfish 
civil 
servants 
are, 
they 
would 



unswervingly 
aim 
to 
the 
best 
of 
their 
abilities 
at 
an 
improvement 
in 
service 
although 
their 
selfish 
profit 
interests 
are 
not 
involved. 
It 
is 
their 
mean 
greed 
that 
jeopardizes 
the 
working 
of 
enterprises 
under 
limited 
profit 
chances. 
Why 
should 
a 
man 
not 
do 
his 
best 
even 
if 
he 
may 
not 
expect 
any 
personal 
advantage 
from 
the 
most 
beneficial 
performance 
of 
his 
duties? 


Nothing 
could 
be 
more 
nonsensical 
than 
to 
hold 
the 
bureaucrat 
up 
in 
this 
way 
as 
a 
model 
for 
the 
entrepreneur. 
The 
bureaucrat 
is 
not 
free 
to 
aim 
at 
improvement. 
He 
is 
bound 
to 
obey 
rules 
and 
regulations 
established 
by 
a 
superior 
body. 
He 
has 
no 
right 
to 
embark 
upon 
innovations 
if 
his 
superiors 
do 
not 
approve 
of 
them. 
His 
duty 
and 
his 
virtue 
is 
to 
be 
obedient. 


Let 
us 
take 
as 
an 
example 
the 
conditions 
of 
army 
life. 
Armies 
are 
certainly 
the 
most 
ideal 
and 
perfect 
bureaucratic 
organizations. 
In 
most 
countries 
they 
are 
commanded 
by 
officers 
who 
are 
sincerely 
dedicated 
to 
one 
goal 
only: 
to 
make 
their 
own 
nation’s 
armed 
forces 
as 
efficient 
as 
possible. 
Nevertheless 
the 
conduct 
of 
military 
affairs 
is 
characterized 
by 
a 
stubborn 
hostility 
to 
every 
attempt 
toward 
improvement. 
It 
has 
been 
said 
that 
the 
general 
staffs 
are 
always 
preparing 
for 
the 
last 
war, 
never 
for 
the 
future 
war. 
Every 
new 
idea 
always 
meets 
with 
adamant 
opposition 
on 
the 
part 
of 
those 
in 
charge 
of 
the 
management. 
The 
champions 
of 
progress 
have 
had 
most 
unpleasant 
experiences. 
There 
is 
no 
need 
to 
insist 
upon 
these 
facts; 
they 
are 
familiar 
to 
everybody. 


The 
reason 
for 
this 
unsatisfactory 
state 
of 
affairs 
is 
obvious. 
Progress 
of 
any 
kind 
is 
always 
at 
variance 
with 
the 
old 
and 
established 
ideas 
and 
therefore 
with 
the 
codes 
inspired 
by 
them. 
Every 
step 
of 
progress 
is 
a 
change 
involving 
heavy 
risks. 
Only 
a 
few 
men, 
endowed 
with 
exceptional 
and 
rare 
abilities, 
have 
the 
gift 
of 
planning 
new 
things 
and 
of 
recognizing 
their 
blessings. 
Under 
capitalism 
the 
innovator 
is 
free 
to 
embark 
upon 
an 
attempt 
to 
realize 
his 
plans 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
unwillingness 
of 
the 
majority 
to 
acknowledge 
their 
merits. 
It 
is 
enough 
if 
he 
succeeds 
in 
persuading 
some 
reasonable 
men 
to 
lend 
him 
funds 
to 
start 
with. 
Under 
a 
bureaucratic 
system 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
convince 
those 
at 
the 
top, 
as 
a 
rule 
old 
men 
accustomed 
to 
do 
things 
in 
prescribed 
ways, 
and 
no 
longer 
open 
to 
new 
ideas. 
No 
progress 
and 
no 
reforms 
can 
be 
expected 
in 
a 
state 
of 
affairs 
where 
the 
first 
step 
is 
to 
obtain 
the 
consent 
of 
the 
old 
men. 
The 
pioneers 
of 
new 
methods 
are 
considered 
rebels 
and 
are 
treated 
as 
such. 
For 
a 



bureaucratic 
mind 
law 
abidance, 
i.e., 
clinging 
to 
the 
customary 
and 
antiquated, 
is 
the 
first 
of 
all 
virtues. 


To 
say 
to 
the 
entrepreneur 
of 
an 
enterprise 
with 
limited 
profit 
chances, 
“Behave 
as 
the 
conscientious 
bureaucrats 
do,” 
is 
tantamount 
to 
telling 
him 
to 
shun 
any 
reform. 
Nobody 
can 
be 
at 
the 
same 
time 
a 
correct 
bureaucrat 
and 
an 
innovator. 
Progress 
is 
precisely 
that 
which 
the 
rules 
and 
regulations 
did 
not 
foresee; 
it 
is 
necessarily 
outside 
the 
field 
of 
bureaucratic 
activities. 


The 
virtue 
of 
the 
profit 
system 
is 
that 
it 
puts 
on 
improvements 
a 
premium 
high 
enough 
to 
act 
as 
an 
incentive 
to 
take 
high 
risks. 
If 
this 
premium 
is 
removed 
or 
seriously 
curtailed, 
there 
cannot 
be 
any 
question 
of 
progress. 


Big 
business 
spends 
considerable 
sums 
on 
research 
because 
it 
is 
eager 
to 
profit 
from 
new 
methods 
of 
production. 
Every 
entrepreneur 
is 
always 
on 
the 
search 
for 
improvement; 
he 
wants 
to 
profit 
either 
from 
lowering 
costs 
or 
from 
perfecting 
his 
products. 
The 
public 
sees 
only 
the 
successful 
innovation. 
It 
does 
not 
realize 
how 
many 
enterprises 
failed 
because 
they 
erred 
in 
adopting 
new 
procedures. 


It 
is 
vain 
to 
ask 
an 
entrepreneur 
to 
embark, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
profit 
incentive, 
on 
all 
the 
improvements 
which 
he 
would 
have 
put 
to 
work 
if 
the 
expected 
profit 
were 
to 
enrich 
him. 
The 
free 
enterpriser 
makes 
his 
decision 
on 
close 
and 
careful 
examination 
of 
all 
the 
pros 
and 
cons 
and 
on 
a 
weighing 
of 
the 
chances 
of 
success 
and 
failure. 
He 
balances 
possible 
gain 
against 
possible 
loss. 
Either 
loss 
or 
gain 
will 
occur 
in 
his 
own 
fortune. 
This 
is 
essential. 
Balancing 
the 
risk 
of 
losing 
one’s 
own 
money 
against 
the 
government’s 
or 
other 
people’s 
chance 
for 
profit 
means 
viewing 
the 
matter 
from 
a 
quite 
different 
angle. 


But 
there 
is 
also 
something 
much 
more 
important. 
A 
faulty 
innovation 
must 
not 
only 
impair 
the 
capital 
invested, 
it 
must 
no 
less 
reduce 
future 
profits. 
The 
greater 
part 
of 
these 
profits 
would 
have 
flowed, 
if 
earned, 
into 
the 
treasury. 
Now, 
their 
falling 
off 
affects 
the 
government’s 
revenue. 
The 
government 
will 
not 
permit 
the 
enterpriser 
to 
risk 
what 
it 
considers 
to 
be 
its 
own 
revenue. 
It 
will 
think 
that 
it 
is 
not 
justified 
in 
leaving 
the 
enterpriser 
the 
right 
to 
expose 
to 
loss 
what 
is 
virtually 
the 
government’s 
money. 
It 
will 
restrict 
the 
entrepreneur’s 
freedom 
to 
manage 
his 
“own” 
affairs, 
which 
practically 
are 
no 



longer 
his 
own 
but 
the 
government’s. 


We 
are 
already 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
such 
policies. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
cost-plus 
contracts 
the 
government 
tries 
to 
satisfy 
itself 
not 
only 
as 
to 
whether 
the 
costs 
claimed 
by 
the 
contractor 
were 
actually 
incurred, 
but 
no 
less 
whether 
they 
are 
allowable 
under 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
contract. 
It 
takes 
every 
reduction 
in 
costs 
incurred 
for 
granted, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
acknowledge 
expenditures 
which, 
in 
the 
opinion 
of 
its 
employees, 
the 
bureaucrats, 
are 
not 
necessary. 
The 
resulting 
situation 
is 
this: 
The 
contractor 
spends 
some 
money 
with 
the 
intention 
of 
reducing 
costs 
of 
production. 
If 
he 
succeeds, 
the 
result 
is?under 
the 
cost 
plus 
a 
percentage 
of 
cost 
method?that 
his 
profit 
is 
curtailed. 
If 
he 
does 
not 
succeed, 
the 
government 
does 
not 
reimburse 
the 
outlays 
in 
question 
and 
he 
loses 
too. 
Every 
attempt 
to 
change 
anything 
in 
the 
traditional 
routine 
of 
production 
has 
to 
turn 
out 
badly 
for 
him. 
The 
only 
way 
to 
avoid 
being 
penalized 
is 
for 
him 
not 
to 
change 
anything. 


In 
the 
field 
of 
taxation 
the 
limitations 
placed 
on 
salaries 
are 
the 
starting 
point 
of 
a 
new 
development. 
They 
affect, 
at 
present, 
only 
the 
higher 
salaries. 
But 
they 
will 
hardly 
stop 
here. 
Once 
the 
principle 
is 
accepted, 
that 
the 
Bureau 
of 
Internal 
Revenue 
has 
the 
right 
to 
declare 
whether 
certain 
costs, 
deductions, 
or 
losses 
are 
justified 
or 
not, 
the 
powers 
of 
the 
enterpriser 
will 
also 
be 
restricted 
with 
regard 
to 
other 
items 
of 
costs. 
Then 
the 
management 
will 
be 
under 
the 
necessity 
of 
assuring 
itself, 
before 
it 
embarks 
upon 
any 
change, 
whether 
the 
tax 
authorities 
approve 
of 
the 
required 
expenditure. 
The 
Collectors 
of 
Internal 
Revenue 
will 
become 
the 
supreme 
authorities 
in 
matters 
of 
manufacturing. 



3. 
INTERFERENCE 
WITH 
THE 
CHOICE 
OF 
PERSONNEL 
Every 
kind 
of 
government 
meddling 
with 
the 
business 
of 
private 
enterprise 
results 
in 
the 
same 
disastrous 
consequences. 
It 
paralyzes 
initiative 
and 
breeds 
bureaucratism. 
We 
cannot 
investigate 
all 
the 
methods 
applied. 
It 
will 
be 
enough 
to 
consider 
one 
especially 
obnoxious 
instance. 


Even 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
in 
the 
prime 
of 
European 
liberalism, 
private 
enterprise 
was 
never 
so 
free 
as 
it 
once 
was 
in 
this 
country. 
In 
continental 
Europe 
every 
enterprise 
and 
particularly 
every 
corporation 
always 
depended 
in 
many 
respects 
on 
the 
discretion 
of 
government 
agencies. 
Bureaus 
had 
the 
power 
of 
inflicting 
serious 
damage 
upon 
every 
firm. 
In 
order 
to 
avoid 
such 
detriments 
it 
was 
necessary 
for 
the 
management 
to 
live 
on 
good 
terms 
with 
those 
in 
power. 


The 
most 
frequent 
procedure 
was 
to 
yield 
to 
the 
government’s 
wishes 
concerning 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
board 
of 
directors. 
Even 
in 
Great 
Britain 
a 
board 
of 
directors 
which 
did 
not 
include 
several 
peers 
was 
considered 
not 
quite 
respectable. 
In 
continental 
Europe 
and 
especially 
in 
Eastern 
and 
Southern 
Europe 
the 
boards 
were 
full 
of 
former 
cabinet 
ministers 
and 
generals, 
of 
politicians 
and 
of 
cousins, 
brothers-in-law, 
schoolmates, 
and 
other 
friends 
of 
such 
dignitaries. 
With 
these 
directors 
no 
commercial 
ability 
or 
business 
experience 
was 
required. 


The 
presence 
of 
such 
ignoramuses 
on 
the 
board 
of 
directors 
was 
by 
and 
large 
innocuous. 
All 
they 
did 
was 
to 
collect 
their 
fees 
and 
share 
in 
the 
profits. 
But 
there 
were 
other 
relatives 
and 
friends 
of 
those 
in 
power 
who 
were 
not 
eligible 
for 
directorships. 
For 
them 
there 
were 
salaried 
positions 
on 
the 
staff. 
These 
men 
were 
much 
more 
a 
liability 
than 
an 
asset. 


With 
the 
increasing 
government 
interference 
with 
business 
it 
became 
necessary 
to 
appoint 
executives 
whose 
main 
duty 
it 
was 
to 
smooth 
away 
difficulties 
with 
the 
authorities. 
First 
it 
was 
only 
one 
vice-president 
in 
charge 
of 
“affairs 
referring 
to 
government 
administration.” 
Later 
the 
main 



requirement 
for 
the 
president 
and 
for 
all 
vice-presidents 
was 
to 
be 
in 
good 
standing 
with 
the 
government 
and 
the 
political 
parties. 
Finally 
no 
corporation 
could 
afford 
the 
“luxury” 
of 
an 
executive 
unpopular 
with 
the 
administration, 
the 
labor-unions, 
and 
the 
great 
political 
parties. 
Former 
government 
officials, 
assistant 
secretaries, 
and 
councilors 
of 
the 
various 
ministries 
were 
considered 
the 
most 
appropriate 
choice 
for 
executive 
positions. 


Such 
executives 
did 
not 
care 
a 
whit 
for 
the 
company’s 
prosperity. 
They 
were 
accustomed 
to 
bureaucratic 
management 
and 
they 
accordingly 
altered 
the 
conduct 
of 
the 
corporation’s 
business. 
Why 
bother 
about 
bringing 
out 
better 
and 
cheaper 
products 
if 
one 
can 
rely 
on 
support 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
government? 
For 
them 
government 
contracts, 
more 
effective 
tariff 
protection, 
and 
other 
government 
favors 
were 
the 
main 
concern. 
And 
they 
paid 
for 
such 
privileges 
by 
contributions 
to 
party 
funds 
and 
government 
propaganda 
funds 
and 
by 
appointing 
people 
sympathetic 
to 
the 
authorities. 


It 
is 
long 
since 
the 
staffs 
of 
the 
big 
German 
corporations 
were 
selected 
from 
the 
viewpoint 
of 
commercial 
and 
technological 
ability. 
Ex-members 
of 
smart 
and 
politically 
reliable 
students’ 
clubs 
often 
had 
a 
better 
chance 
of 
employment 
and 
advancement 
than 
efficient 
experts. 


American 
conditions 
are 
very 
different. 
As 
in 
every 
sphere 
of 
bureaucracy, 
America 
is 
“backward” 
in 
the 
field 
of 
bureaucratization 
of 
private 
enterprise 
also. 
It 
is 
an 
open 
question 
whether 
Secretary 
Ickes 
was 
right 
in 
saying: 
“Every 
big 
business 
is 
a 
bureaucracy.”1 
But 
if 
the 
Secretary 
of 
the 
Interior 
is 
right, 
or 
as 
far 
as 
he 
is 
right, 
this 
is 
not 
an 
outcome 
of 
the 
evolution 
of 
private 
business 
but 
of 
the 
growing 
government 
interference 
with 
business. 


4. 
UNLIMITED 
DEPENDENCE 
ON 
THE 
DISCRETION 
OF 
GOVERNMENT 
BUREAUS 
Every 
American 
businessman 
who 
has 
had 
the 
opportunity 
to 
become 
acquainted 
with 
economic 
conditions 
in 
Southern 
and 
Eastern 
Europe 
condenses 
his 
observations 
into 
two 
points: 
The 
entrepreneurs 
of 
these 
countries 
do 
not 
bother 
about 
production 
efficiency, 
and 
the 
governments 
are 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
corrupt 
cliques. 
This 
characterization 
is 
by 
and 
large 
correct. 
But 
it 
fails 
to 
mention 
that 
both 
industrial 
inefficiency 
and 
corruption 
are 
the 
consequences 
of 
methods 
of 
government 
interference 
with 
business 
as 



applied 
in 
these 
countries. 


Under 
this 
system 
the 
government 
has 
unlimited 
power 
to 
ruin 
every 
enterprise 
or 
to 
lavish 
favors 
upon 
it. 
The 
success 
or 
failure 
of 
every 
business 
depends 
entirely 
upon 
the 
free 
discretion 
of 
those 
in 
office. 
If 
the 
businessman 
does 
not 
happen 
to 
be 
a 
citizen 
of 
a 
powerful 
foreign 
nation 
whose 
diplomatic 
and 
consular 
agents 
grant 
him 
protection, 
he 
is 
at 
the 
mercy 
of 
the 
administration 
and 
the 
ruling 
party. 
They 
can 
take 
away 
all 
his 
property 
and 
imprison 
him. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
they 
can 
make 
him 
rich. 


The 
government 
determines 
the 
height 
of 
tariffs 
and 
freight 
rates. 
It 
grants 
or 
denies 
import 
and 
export 
licenses. 
Every 
citizen 
or 
resident 
is 
bound 
to 
sell 
all 
his 
proceeds 
in 
foreign 
exchange 
to 
the 
government 
at 
a 
price 
fixed 
by 
the 
government. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
government 
is 
the 
only 
seller 
of 
foreign 
exchange; 
it 
is 
free 
to 
refuse 
ad 
libitum 
applications 
for 
foreign 
exchange. 
In 
Europe 
where 
almost 
every 
kind 
of 
production 
depends 
upon 
the 
importation 
of 
equipment, 
machinery, 
raw 
materials, 
and 
half-finished 
goods 
from 
abroad, 
such 
a 
refusal 
is 
tantamount 
to 
a 
closing 
of 
the 
factory. 
The 
final 
determination 
of 
taxes 
due 
is 
practically 
left 
to 
the 
unlimited 
discretion 
of 
the 
authorities. 
The 
government 
can 
use 
any 
pretext 
for 
the 
seizure 
of 
any 
plant 
or 
shop. 
Parliament 
is 
a 
puppet 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
rulers; 
the 
courts 
are 
packed. 


In 
such 
an 
environment 
the 
entrepreneur 
must 
resort 
to 
two 
means: 
diplomacy 
and 
bribery. 
He 
must 
use 
these 
methods 
not 
only 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
ruling 
party, 
but 
no 
less 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
outlawed 
and 
persecuted 
opposition 
groups 
which 
one 
day 
may 
seize 
the 
reins. 
It 
is 
a 
dangerous 
kind 
of 
double-dealing; 
only 
men 
devoid 
of 
fear 
and 
inhibitions 
can 
last 
in 
this 
rotten 
milieu. 
Businessmen 
who 
have 
grown 
up 
under 
the 
conditions 
of 
a 
more 
liberal 
age 
have 
to 
leave 
and 
are 
replaced 
by 
adventurers. 
West-
European 
and 
American 
entrepreneurs, 
used 
to 
an 
environment 
of 
legality 
and 
correctness, 
are 
lost 
unless 
they 
secure 
the 
services 
of 
native 
agents. 


This 
system, 
of 
course, 
does 
not 
offer 
much 
incentive 
for 
technological 
improvement. 
The 
entrepreneur 
considers 
additional 
investment 
only 
if 
he 
can 
buy 
the 
machinery 
on 
credit 
from 
a 
foreign 
firm. 
Being 
a 
debtor 
of 
a 
corporation 
of 
one 
of 
the 
Western 
countries 
is 
deemed 
an 
advantage 
because 
one 
expects 
that 
the 
diplomats 
concerned 
will 
interfere 
for 
the 
protection 
of 



the 
creditor 
and 
thus 
help 
the 
debtor 
too. 
New 
branches 
of 
production 
are 
inaugurated 
only 
if 
the 
government 
grants 
such 
a 
premium 
that 
huge 
profits 
are 
to 
be 
hoped 
for. 


It 
would 
be 
a 
mistake 
to 
place 
the 
blame 
for 
this 
corruption 
on 
the 
system 
of 
government 
interference 
with 
business 
and 
bureaucratism 
as 
such. 
It 
is 
bureaucratism 
degenerated 
into 
racketeering 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
depraved 
politicians. 
Yet 
we 
must 
realize 
that 
these 
countries 
would 
have 
avoided 
the 
evil 
if 
they 
had 
not 
abandoned 
the 
system 
of 
free 
enterprise. 
Economic 
postwar 
reconstruction 
must 
start 
in 
these 
countries 
with 
a 
radical 
change 
in 
their 
policies.

THE 
SOCIAL 
AND 
POLITICAL 
IMPLICATIONS 
OF 
BUREAUCRATIZATION 



1. 
THE 
PHILOSOPHY 
OF 
BUREAUCRATISM 
THE 
antagonism 
which 
the 
people 
had 
to 
encounter 
in 
earlier 
struggles 
for 
freedom 
was 
simple 
and 
could 
be 
understood 
by 
everybody. 
There 
were 
on 
the 
one 
side 
the 
tyrants 
and 
their 
supporters; 
there 
were 
on 
the 
other 
side 
the 
advocates 
of 
popular 
government. 
The 
political 
conflicts 
were 
struggles 
of 
various 
groups 
for 
supremacy. 
The 
question 
was: 
Who 
should 
rule? 
We 
or 
they? 
The 
few 
or 
the 
many? 
The 
despot 
or 
the 
aristocracy 
or 
the 
people? 


Today 
the 
fashionable 
philosophy 
of 
Statolatry 
has 
obfuscated 
the 
issue. 
The 
political 
conflicts 
are 
no 
longer 
seen 
as 
struggles 
between 
groups 
of 
men. 
They 
are 
considered 
a 
war 
between 
two 
principles, 
the 
good 
and 
the 
bad. 
The 
good 
is 
embodied 
in 
the 
great 
god 
State, 
the 
materialization 
of 
the 
eternal 
idea 
of 
morality, 
and 
the 
bad 
in 
the 
“rugged 
individualism” 
of 
selfish 
men.1 
In 
this 
antagonism 
the 
State 
is 
always 
right 
and 
the 
individual 
always 
wrong. 
The 
State 
is 
the 
representative 
of 
the 
commonweal, 
of 
justice, 
civilization, 
and 
superior 
wisdom. 
The 
individual 
is 
a 
poor 
wretch, 
a 
vicious 
fool. 


When 
a 
German 
says 
“der 
Staat” 
or 
when 
a 
Marxian 
says 
“society,” 
they 
are 
overwhelmed 
by 
reverential 
awe. 
How 
can 
a 
man 
be 
so 
entirely 
corrupt 
as 
to 
rise 
in 
rebellion 
against 
this 
Supreme 
Being? 


Louis 
XIV 
was 
very 
frank 
and 
sincere 
when 
he 
said: 
I 
am 
the 
State. 
The 
modern 
etatist 
is 
modest. 
He 
says: 
I 
am 
the 
servant 
of 
the 
State; 
but, 
he 
implies, 
the 
State 
is 
God. 
You 
could 
revolt 
against 
a 
Bourbon 
king, 
and 
the 
French 
did 
it. 
This 
was, 
of 
course, 
a 
struggle 
of 
man 
against 
man. 
But 
you 
cannot 
revolt 
against 
the 
god 
State 
and 
against 
his 
humble 
handy 
man, 
the 
bureaucrat. 


Let 
us 
not 
question 
the 
sincerity 
of 
the 
well-intentioned 
officeholder. 
He 
is 
fully 
imbued 
with 
the 
idea 
that 
it 
is 
his 
sacred 
duty 
to 
fight 
for 
his 
idol 
against 
the 
selfishness 
of 
the 
populace. 
He 
is, 
in 
his 
opinion, 
the 
champion 
of 
the 
eternal 
divine 
law. 
He 
does 
not 
feel 
himself 
morally 
bound 
by 
the 
human 
laws 
which 
the 
defenders 
of 
individualism 
have 
written 
into 
the 
statutes. 
Men 



cannot 
alter 
the 
genuine 
laws 
of 
god, 
the 
State. 
The 
individual 
citizen, 
in 
violating 
one 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
his 
country, 
is 
a 
criminal 
deserving 
punishment. 
He 
has 
acted 
for 
his 
own 
selfish 
advantage. 
But 
it 
is 
quite 
a 
different 
thing 
if 
an 
officeholder 
evades 
the 
duly 
promulgated 
laws 
of 
the 
nation 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
“State.” 
In 
the 
opinion 
of 
“reactionary” 
courts 
he 
may 
be 
technically 
guilty 
of 
a 
contravention. 
But 
in 
a 
higher 
moral 
sense 
he 
was 
right. 
He 
has 
broken 
human 
laws 
lest 
he 
violate 
a 
divine 
law. 


This 
is 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
philosophy 
of 
bureaucratism. 
The 
written 
laws 
are 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
officials 
barriers 
erected 
for 
the 
protection 
of 
scoundrels 
against 
the 
fair 
claims 
of 
society. 
Why 
should 
a 
criminal 
evade 
punishment 
only 
because 
the 
“State” 
in 
prosecuting 
him 
has 
violated 
some 
frivolous 
formalities? 
Why 
should 
a 
man 
pay 
lower 
taxes 
only 
because 
there 
is 
a 
loophole 
left 
in 
the 
tax 
law? 
Why 
should 
lawyers 
make 
a 
living 
advising 
people 
how 
to 
profit 
from 
the 
imperfections 
of 
the 
written 
law? 
What 
is 
the 
use 
of 
all 
these 
restrictions 
imposed 
by 
the 
written 
law 
upon 
the 
government 
official’s 
honest 
endeavors 
to 
make 
the 
people 
happy? 
If 
only 
there 
were 
no 
constitutions, 
bills 
of 
rights, 
laws, 
parliaments, 
and 
courts! 
No 
newspapers 
and 
no 
attorneys! 
How 
fine 
the 
world 
would 
be 
if 
the 
“State” 
were 
free 
to 
cure 
all 
ills! 


It 
is 
one 
step 
only 
from 
such 
a 
mentality 
to 
the 
perfect 
totalitarianism 
of 
Stalin 
and 
Hitler. 


The 
answer 
to 
be 
given 
to 
these 
bureaucratic 
radicals 
is 
obvious. 
The 
citizen 
may 
reply: 
You 
may 
be 
excellent 
and 
lofty 
men, 
much 
better 
than 
we 
other 
citizens 
are. 
We 
do 
not 
question 
your 
competence 
and 
your 
intelligence. 
But 
you 
are 
not 
the 
vicars 
of 
a 
god 
called 
“the 
State.” 
You 
are 
servants 
of 
the 
law, 
the 
duly 
passed 
laws 
of 
our 
nation. 
It 
is 
not 
your 
business 
to 
criticize 
the 
law, 
still 
less 
to 
violate 
it. 
In 
violating 
the 
law 
you 
are 
perhaps 
worse 
than 
a 
good 
many 
of 
the 
racketeers, 
no 
matter 
how 
good 
your 
intentions 
may 
be. 
For 
you 
are 
appointed, 
sworn, 
and 
paid 
to 
enforce 
the 
law, 
not 
to 
break 
it. 
The 
worst 
law 
is 
better 
than 
bureaucratic 
tyranny. 


The 
main 
difference 
between 
a 
policeman 
and 
a 
kidnaper 
and 
between 
a 
tax 
collector 
and 
a 
robber 
is 
that 
the 
policeman 
and 
the 
tax 
collector 
obey 
and 
enforce 
the 
law, 
while 
the 
kidnaper 
and 
robber 
violate 
it. 
Remove 
the 
law, 
and 
society 
will 
be 
destroyed 
by 
anarchy. 
The 
State 
is 
the 
only 
institution 



entitled 
to 
apply 
coercion 
and 
compulsion 
and 
to 
inflict 
harm 
upon 
individuals. 
This 
tremendous 
power 
cannot 
be 
abandoned 
to 
the 
discretion 
of 
some 
men, 
however 
competent 
and 
clever 
they 
may 
deem 
themselves. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
restrict 
its 
application. 
This 
is 
the 
task 
of 
the 
laws. 


The 
officeholders 
and 
the 
bureaucrats 
are 
not 
the 
State. 
They 
are 
men 
selected 
for 
the 
application 
of 
the 
laws. 
One 
may 
call 
such 
opinions 
orthodox 
and 
doctrinaire. 
They 
are 
indeed 
the 
expression 
of 
old 
wisdom. 
But 
the 
alternative 
to 
the 
rule 
of 
law 
is 
the 
rule 
of 
despots. 



2. 
BUREAUCRATIC 
COMPLACENCY 
The 
officeholder’s 
task 
is 
to 
serve 
the 
public. 
His 
office 
has 
been 
established? 
directly 
or 
indirectly?by 
a 
legislative 
act 
and 
by 
the 
allocation 
of 
the 
means 
necessary 
for 
its 
support 
in 
the 
budget. 
He 
executes 
the 
laws 
of 
his 
country. 
In 
performing 
his 
duties 
he 
shows 
himself 
a 
useful 
member 
of 
the 
community, 
even 
if 
the 
laws 
which 
he 
has 
to 
put 
into 
practice 
are 
detrimental 
to 
the 
commonweal. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
he 
who 
is 
responsible 
for 
their 
inadequacy. 
The 
sovereign 
people 
is 
to 
blame, 
not 
the 
faithful 
executor 
of 
the 
people’s 
will. 
As 
the 
distillers 
are 
not 
responsible 
for 
people 
getting 
drunk, 
so 
the 
government’s 
clerks 
are 
not 
responsible 
for 
the 
undesirable 
consequences 
of 
unwise 
laws. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
is 
not 
the 
merit 
of 
the 
bureaucrats 
that 
many 
benefits 
are 
derived 
from 
their 
actions. 
That 
the 
police 
department’s 
work 
is 
so 
efficient 
that 
the 
citizens 
are 
fairly 
well 
protected 
against 
murder, 
robbery, 
and 
theft 
does 
not 
oblige 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
people 
to 
be 
more 
grateful 
to 
the 
police 
officers 
than 
to 
any 
other 
fellow 
citizens 
rendering 
useful 
services. 
The 
police 
officer 
and 
the 
fireman 
have 
no 
better 
claim 
to 
the 
public’s 
gratitude 
than 
the 
doctors, 
the 
railroad 
engineers, 
the 
welders, 
the 
sailors, 
or 
the 
manufacturers 
of 
any 
useful 
commodity. 
The 
traffic 
cop 
has 
no 
more 
cause 
for 
conceit 
than 
the 
manufacturer 
of 
traffic 
lights. 
It 
is 
not 
his 
merit 
that 
his 
superiors 
assigned 
him 
to 
a 
duty 
in 
which 
he 
daily 
and 
hourly 
prevents 
accidental 
killing 
and 
thus 
saves 
many 
people’s 
lives. 


It 
is 
true 
that 
society 
could 
not 
do 
without 
the 
services 
rendered 
by 
patrolmen, 
tax 
collectors, 
and 
clerks 
of 
the 
courts. 
But 
it 
is 
no 
less 
true 
that 
everyone 
would 
suffer 
great 
damage 
if 
there 
were 
no 
scavengers, 
chimney 
sweepers, 
dishwashers, 
and 
bug 
exterminators. 
Within 
the 
framework 
of 
social 
coöperation 
every 
citizen 
depends 
on 
the 
services 
rendered 
by 
all 
his 
fellow 
citizens. 
The 
great 
surgeon 
and 
the 
eminent 
musician 
would 
never 
have 
been 
able 
to 
concentrate 
all 
their 
efforts 
upon 
surgery 
and 
music 
if 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
had 
not 
freed 
them 
from 
the 
necessity 
of 
taking 
care 
of 
many 
trifles 
the 
performance 
of 
which 
would 
have 
prevented 
them 
from 
becoming 
perfect 
specialists. 
The 
ambassador 
and 
the 
lighthousekeeper 
have 



no 
better 
claim 
to 
the 
epithet 
pillar 
of 
society 
than 
the 
Pullman 
porter 
and 
the 
charwoman. 
For, 
under 
the 
division 
of 
labor, 
the 
structure 
of 
society 
rests 
on 
the 
shoulders 
of 
all 
men 
and 
women. 


There 
are, 
of 
course, 
men 
and 
women 
serving 
in 
an 
altruistic 
and 
entirely 
detached 
way. 
Mankind 
would 
never 
have 
reached 
the 
present 
state 
of 
civilization 
without 
heroism 
and 
self-sacrifice 
on 
the 
part 
of 
an 
elite. 
Every 
step 
forward 
on 
the 
way 
toward 
an 
improvement 
of 
moral 
conditions 
has 
been 
an 
achievement 
of 
men 
who 
were 
ready 
to 
sacrifice 
their 
own 
wellbeing, 
their 
health, 
and 
their 
lives 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
a 
cause 
that 
they 
considered 
just 
and 
beneficial. 
They 
did 
what 
they 
considered 
their 
duty 
without 
bothering 
whether 
they 
themselves 
would 
not 
be 
victimized. 
These 
people 
did 
not 
work 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
reward, 
they 
served 
their 
cause 
unto 
death. 


It 
was 
a 
purposeful 
confusion 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
German 
metaphysicians 
of 
statolatry 
that 
they 
clothed 
all 
men 
in 
the 
government 
service 
with 
the 
gloriole 
of 
such 
altruistic 
self-sacrifice. 
From 
the 
writings 
of 
the 
German 
etatists 
the 
civil 
servant 
emerges 
as 
a 
saintly 
being, 
a 
sort 
of 
monk 
who 
forsook 
all 
earthly 
pleasures 
and 
all 
personal 
happiness 
in 
order 
to 
serve, 
to 
the 
best 
of 
his 
abilities, 
God’s 
lieutenant, 
once 
the 
Hohenzollern 
king 
and 
today 
the 
Führer. 
The 
Staatsbeamte 
does 
not 
work 
for 
pay 
because 
no 
salary 
however 
large 
could 
be 
considered 
an 
adequate 
reward 
for 
the 
invaluable 
and 
priceless 
benefits 
that 
society 
derives 
from 
his 
self-denying 
sacrifice. 
Society 
owes 
him 
not 
pay 
but 
a 
maintenance 
adequate 
to 
his 
rank 
in 
the 
official 
hierarchy. 
It 
is 
a 
misnomer 
to 
call 
this 
maintenance 
a 
salary.2 
Only 
liberals, 
biased 
by 
the 
prejudices 
and 
errors 
of 
commercialism, 
use 
such 
a 
wrong 
term. 
If 
the 
Beamtengehalt 
(the 
civil 
servant’s 
salary) 
were 
a 
real 
salary, 
it 
would 
be 
only 
just 
and 
natural 
to 
give 
the 
holder 
of 
the 
most 
modest 
office 
an 
income 
higher 
than 
that 
of 
anybody 
outside 
of 
the 
official 
hierarchy. 
Every 
civil 
servant 
is, 
when 
on 
duty, 
a 
mandatory 
of 
the 
State’s 
sovereignty 
and 
infallibility. 
His 
testimony 
in 
court 
counts 
more 
than 
that 
of 
the 
layman. 


All 
this 
was 
sheer 
nonsense. 
In 
all 
countries 
most 
people 
joined 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
government 
offices 
because 
the 
salary 
and 
the 
pension 
offered 
were 
higher 
than 
what 
they 
could 
expect 
to 
earn 
in 
other 
occupations. 
They 
did 
not 
renounce 
anything 
in 
serving 
the 
government. 
Civil 
service 
was 
for 
them 
the 
most 
profitable 
job 
they 
could 
find. 



The 
incentive 
offered 
by 
the 
civil 
service 
in 
Europe 
consisted 
not 
only 
in 
the 
level 
of 
the 
salary 
and 
the 
pension; 
many 
applicants, 
and 
not 
the 
best 
ones, 
were 
attracted 
by 
the 
ease 
of 
the 
work 
and 
by 
the 
security. 
As 
a 
rule 
government 
jobs 
were 
less 
exigent 
than 
those 
in 
business. 
Besides, 
the 
appointments 
were 
for 
life. 
An 
employee 
could 
be 
dismissed 
only 
when 
a 
kind 
of 
judicial 
trial 
had 
found 
him 
guilty 
of 
heinous 
neglect 
of 
his 
duties. 
In 
Germany, 
Russia, 
and 
France, 
every 
year 
many 
thousands 
of 
boys 
whose 
life 
plan 
was 
completely 
fixed 
entered 
the 
lowest 
grade 
of 
the 
system 
of 
secondary 
education. 
They 
would 
take 
their 
degrees, 
they 
would 
get 
a 
job 
in 
one 
of 
the 
many 
departments, 
they 
would 
serve 
thirty 
or 
forty 
years, 
and 
then 
retire 
with 
a 
pension. 
Life 
had 
no 
surprises 
and 
no 
sensations 
for 
them, 
everything 
was 
plain 
and 
known 
beforehand. 


The 
difference 
between 
the 
social 
prestige 
of 
government 
jobs 
in 
continental 
Europe 
and 
in 
America 
may 
be 
illustrated 
by 
an 
example. 
In 
Europe 
social 
and 
political 
discrimination 
against 
a 
minority 
group 
took 
the 
form 
of 
barring 
such 
people 
from 
access 
to 
all 
government 
jobs, 
no 
matter 
how 
modest 
the 
position 
and 
the 
salary. 
In 
Germany, 
in 
the 
Austro-Hungarian 
Empire, 
and 
in 
many 
other 
countries 
all 
those 
subordinate 
jobs 
that 
did 
not 
require 
special 
abilities 
or 
training?like 
attendants, 
ushers, 
heralds, 
beadles, 
apparitors, 
messengers, 
janitors?were 
legally 
reserved 
for 
ex-soldiers 
who 
had 
voluntarily 
given 
more 
years 
of 
active 
service 
in 
the 
armed 
forces 
than 
the 
minimum 
required 
by 
the 
law. 
These 
jobs 
were 
considered 
highly 
valued 
rewards 
for 
noncommissioned 
officers. 
In 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
people, 
it 
was 
a 
privilege 
to 
serve 
as 
an 
attendant 
in 
a 
bureau. 
If 
in 
Germany 
there 
had 
been 
a 
class 
of 
the 
social 
status 
of 
the 
American 
Negro, 
such 
persons 
would 
never 
have 
ventured 
to 
apply 
for 
one 
of 
these 
jobs. 
They 
would 
have 
known 
that 
such 
an 
ambition 
was 
extravagant 
for 
them. 



3. 
THE 
BUREAUCRAT 
AS 
A 
VOTER 
The 
bureaucrat 
is 
not 
only 
a 
government 
employee. 
He 
is, 
under 
a 
democratic 
constitution, 
at 
the 
same 
time 
a 
voter 
and 
as 
such 
a 
part 
of 
the 
sovereign, 
his 
employer. 
He 
is 
in 
a 
peculiar 
position: 
he 
is 
both 
employer 
and 
employee. 
And 
his 
pecuniary 
interest 
as 
employee 
towers 
above 
his 
interest 
as 
employer, 
as 
he 
gets 
much 
more 
from 
the 
public 
funds 
than 
he 
contributes 
to 
them. 


This 
double 
relationship 
becomes 
more 
important 
as 
the 
people 
on 
the 
government’s 
pay 
roll 
increase. 
The 
bureaucrat 
as 
voter 
is 
more 
eager 
to 
get 
a 
raise 
than 
to 
keep 
the 
budget 
balanced. 
His 
main 
concern 
is 
to 
swell 
the 
pay 
roll. 


The 
political 
structure 
of 
Germany 
and 
France, 
in 
the 
last 
years 
preceding 
the 
fall 
of 
their 
democratic 
constitutions, 
was 
to 
a 
very 
great 
extent 
influenced 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
for 
a 
considerable 
part 
of 
the 
electorate 
the 
state 
was 
the 
source 
of 
income. 
There 
were 
not 
only 
the 
hosts 
of 
public 
employees, 
and 
those 
employed 
in 
the 
nationalized 
branches 
of 
business 
(e.g., 
railroad, 
post, 
telegraph, 
and 
telephone), 
there 
were 
the 
receivers 
of 
the 
unemployment 
dole 
and 
of 
social 
security 
benefits, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
farmers 
and 
some 
other 
groups 
which 
the 
government 
directly 
or 
indirectly 
subsidized. 
Their 
main 
concern 
was 
to 
get 
more 
out 
of 
the 
public 
funds. 
They 
did 
not 
care 
for 
“ideal” 
issues 
like 
liberty, 
justice, 
the 
supremacy 
of 
the 
law, 
and 
good 
government. 
They 
asked 
for 
more 
money, 
that 
was 
all. 
No 
candidate 
for 
parliament, 
provincial 
diets, 
or 
town 
councils 
could 
risk 
opposing 
the 
appetite 
of 
the 
public 
employees 
for 
a 
raise. 
The 
various 
political 
parties 
were 
eager 
to 
outdo 
one 
another 
in 
munificence. 


In 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
the 
parliaments 
were 
intent 
on 
restricting 
public 
expenditures 
as 
much 
as 
possible. 
But 
now 
thrift 
became 
despicable. 
Boundless 
spending 
was 
considered 
a 
wise 
policy. 
Both 
the 
party 
in 
power 
and 
the 
opposition 
strove 
for 
popularity 
by 
openhandedness. 
To 
create 
new 
offices 
with 
new 
employees 
was 
called 
a 
“positive” 
policy, 
and 
every 
attempt 
to 
prevent 
squandering 
public 
funds 
was 
disparaged 
as 
“negativism.” 



Representative 
democracy 
cannot 
subsist 
if 
a 
great 
part 
of 
the 
voters 
are 
on 
the 
government 
pay 
roll. 
If 
the 
members 
of 
parliament 
no 
longer 
consider 
themselves 
mandatories 
of 
the 
taxpayers 
but 
deputies 
of 
those 
receiving 
salaries, 
wages, 
subsidies, 
doles, 
and 
other 
benefits 
from 
the 
treasury, 
democracy 
is 
done 
for. 


This 
is 
one 
of 
the 
antinomies 
inherent 
in 
present-day 
constitutional 
issues. 
It 
has 
made 
many 
people 
despair 
of 
the 
future 
of 
democracy. 
As 
they 
became 
convinced 
that 
the 
trend 
toward 
more 
government 
interference 
with 
business, 
toward 
more 
offices 
with 
more 
employees, 
toward 
more 
doles 
and 
subsidies 
is 
inevitable, 
they 
could 
not 
help 
losing 
confidence 
in 
government 
by 
the 
people. 



4. 
THE 
BUREAUCRATIZATION 
OF 
THE 
MIND 
The 
modern 
trend 
toward 
government 
omnipotence 
and 
totalitarianism 
would 
have 
been 
nipped 
in 
the 
bud 
if 
its 
advocates 
had 
not 
succeeded 
in 
indoctrinating 
youth 
with 
their 
tenets 
and 
in 
preventing 
them 
from 
becoming 
acquainted 
with 
the 
teachings 
of 
economics. 


Economics 
is 
a 
theoretical 
science 
and 
as 
such 
does 
not 
tell 
man 
what 
values 
he 
should 
prefer 
and 
what 
ends 
he 
should 
aim 
at. 
It 
does 
not 
establish 
ultimate 
ends. 
This 
is 
not 
the 
task 
of 
the 
thinking 
man 
but 
that 
of 
the 
acting 
man. 
Science 
is 
a 
product 
of 
thought, 
action 
a 
product 
of 
will. 
In 
this 
sense 
we 
may 
say 
that 
economics 
as 
a 
science 
is 
neutral 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
ultimate 
ends 
of 
human 
endeavor. 


But 
it 
is 
different 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
means 
to 
be 
applied 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
given 
social 
ends. 
There 
economics 
is 
the 
only 
reliable 
guide 
of 
action. 
If 
men 
are 
eager 
to 
succeed 
in 
the 
pursuit 
of 
any 
social 
ends, 
they 
must 
adjust 
their 
conduct 
to 
the 
results 
of 
economic 
thinking. 


The 
outstanding 
fact 
of 
the 
intellectual 
history 
of 
the 
last 
hundred 
years 
is 
the 
struggle 
against 
economics. 
The 
advocates 
of 
government 
omnipotence 
did 
not 
enter 
into 
a 
discussion 
of 
the 
problems 
involved. 
They 
called 
the 
economists 
names, 
they 
cast 
suspicion 
upon 
their 
motives, 
they 
ridiculed 
them 
and 
called 
down 
curses 
upon 
them. 


It 
is, 
however, 
not 
the 
task 
of 
this 
book 
to 
deal 
with 
this 
phenomenon. 
We 
have 
to 
limit 
ourselves 
to 
the 
description 
of 
the 
role 
that 
bureaucracy 
played 
in 
this 
development. 


In 
most 
countries 
of 
the 
European 
continent 
the 
universities 
are 
owned 
and 
operated 
by 
the 
government. 
They 
are 
subject 
to 
the 
control 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
as 
a 
police 
station 
is 
subject 
to 
the 
head 
of 
the 
police 
department. 
The 
teachers 
are 
civil 
servants 
like 
patrolmen 
and 
customs 
officers. 
Nineteenth-century 
liberalism 
tried 
to 
limit 
the 
right 
of 
the 
Ministry 



of 
Education 
to 
interfere 
with 
the 
freedom 
of 
university 
professors 
to 
teach 
what 
they 
considered 
true 
and 
correct. 
But 
as 
the 
government 
appointed 
the 
professors, 
it 
appointed 
only 
trustworthy 
and 
reliable 
men, 
that 
is, 
men 
who 
shared 
the 
government’s 
viewpoint 
and 
were 
ready 
to 
disparage 
economics 
and 
to 
teach 
the 
doctrine 
of 
government 
omnipotence. 


As 
in 
all 
other 
fields 
of 
bureaucratization, 
nineteenth-century 
Germany 
was 
far 
ahead 
of 
other 
nations 
in 
this 
matter 
too. 
Nothing 
characterizes 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
German 
universities 
better 
than 
a 
passage 
of 
an 
oration 
that 
the 
physiologist 
Emil 
du 
Bois-Reymond 
delivered 
in 
1870 
in 
his 
double 
capacity 
as 
Rector 
of 
the 
University 
of 
Berlin 
and 
as 
President 
of 
the 
Prussian 
Academy 
of 
Science: 
“We, 
the 
University 
of 
Berlin, 
quartered 
opposite 
the 
King’s 
palace, 
are, 
by 
the 
deed 
of 
our 
foundation, 
the 
intellectual 
bodyguard 
of 
the 
House 
of 
Hohenzollern.” 
The 
idea 
that 
such 
a 
royal 
henchman 
should 
profess 
views 
contrary 
to 
the 
tenets 
of 
the 
government, 
his 
employer, 
was 
incomprehensible 
to 
the 
Prussian 
mind. 
To 
maintain 
the 
theory 
that 
there 
are 
such 
things 
as 
economic 
laws 
was 
deemed 
a 
kind 
of 
rebellion. 
For 
if 
there 
are 
economic 
laws, 
then 
governments 
cannot 
be 
regarded 
as 
omnipotent, 
as 
their 
policies 
could 
only 
succeed 
when 
adjusted 
to 
the 
operation 
of 
these 
laws. 
Thus 
the 
main 
concern 
of 
the 
German 
professors 
of 
the 
social 
sciences 
was 
to 
denounce 
the 
scandalous 
heresy 
that 
there 
is 
a 
regularity 
in 
economic 
phenomena. 
The 
teaching 
of 
economics 
was 
anathematized 
and 
wirtschaftliche 
Staatswissenschaften 
(economic 
aspects 
of 
political 
science) 
put 
in 
its 
place. 
The 
only 
qualities 
required 
in 
an 
academic 
teacher 
of 
the 
social 
sciences 
were 
disparagement 
of 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
market 
system 
and 
enthusiastic 
support 
of 
government 
control. 
Under 
the 
Kaiser 
radical 
Marxians 
who 
openly 
advocated 
a 
revolutionary 
upheaval 
and 
the 
violent 
overthrow 
of 
the 
government 
were 
not 
appointed 
to 
full-time 
professorships; 
the 
Weimar 
Republic 
virtually 
abolished 
this 
discrimination. 


Economics 
deals 
with 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
whole 
system 
of 
social 
coöperation, 
with 
the 
interplay 
of 
all 
its 
determinants, 
and 
with 
the 
interdependence 
of 
the 
various 
branches 
of 
production. 
It 
cannot 
be 
broken 
up 
into 
separate 
fields 
open 
to 
treatment 
by 
specialists 
who 
neglect 
the 
rest. 
It 
is 
simply 
nonsensical 
to 
study 
money 
or 
labor 
or 
foreign 
trade 
with 
the 
same 
kind 
of 
specialization 
which 
historians 
apply 
when 
dividing 
human 
history 
into 
various 
compartments. 
The 
history 
of 
Sweden 
can 
be 
treated 
with 
almost 



no 
reference 
to 
the 
history 
of 
Peru. 
But 
you 
cannot 
deal 
with 
wage 
rates 
without 
dealing 
at 
the 
same 
time 
with 
commodity 
prices, 
interest 
rates, 
and 
profits. 
Every 
change 
occurring 
in 
one 
of 
the 
economic 
elements 
affects 
all 
other 
elements. 
One 
will 
never 
discover 
what 
a 
definite 
policy 
or 
change 
brings 
about 
if 
one 
limits 
his 
investigation 
to 
a 
special 
segment 
of 
the 
whole 
system. 


It 
is 
precisely 
this 
interdependence 
that 
the 
government 
does 
not 
want 
to 
see 
when 
it 
meddles 
in 
economic 
affairs. 
The 
government 
pretends 
to 
be 
endowed 
with 
the 
mystical 
power 
to 
accord 
favors 
out 
of 
an 
inexhaustible 
horn 
of 
plenty. 
It 
is 
both 
omniscient 
and 
omnipotent. 
It 
can 
by 
a 
magic 
wand 
create 
happiness 
and 
abundance. 


The 
truth 
is 
that 
the 
government 
cannot 
give 
if 
it 
does 
not 
take 
from 
somebody. 
A 
subsidy 
is 
never 
paid 
by 
the 
government 
out 
of 
its 
own 
funds; 
it 
is 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
taxpayer 
that 
the 
state 
grants 
subsidies. 
Inflation 
and 
credit 
expansion, 
the 
preferred 
methods 
of 
present-day 
government 
openhandedness, 
do 
not 
add 
anything 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
resources 
available. 
They 
make 
some 
people 
more 
prosperous, 
but 
only 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
they 
make 
others 
poorer. 
Interference 
with 
the 
market, 
with 
commodity 
prices, 
wage 
rates, 
and 
interest 
rates 
as 
determined 
by 
demand 
and 
supply, 
may 
in 
the 
short 
run 
attain 
the 
ends 
aimed 
at 
by 
the 
government. 
But 
in 
the 
long 
run 
such 
measures 
always 
result 
in 
a 
state 
of 
affairs 
which?from 
the 
viewpoint 
of 
the 
government?is 
more 
unsatisfactory 
than 
the 
previous 
state 
they 
were 
intended 
to 
alter. 


It 
is 
not 
in 
the 
power 
of 
the 
government 
to 
make 
everybody 
more 
prosperous. 
It 
can 
raise 
the 
income 
of 
the 
farmers 
by 
forcibly 
restricting 
domestic 
agricultural 
production. 
But 
the 
higher 
prices 
of 
farm 
products 
are 
paid 
by 
the 
consumers, 
not 
by 
the 
state. 
The 
counterpart 
of 
the 
farmers’ 
higher 
standard 
of 
living 
is 
the 
lowering 
of 
the 
standard 
of 
living 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
nation. 
The 
government 
can 
protect 
the 
small 
shops 
against 
the 
competition 
of 
department 
stores 
and 
chain 
stores. 
But 
here 
again 
the 
consumers 
foot 
the 
bill. 
The 
state 
can 
improve 
the 
conditions 
of 
a 
part 
of 
the 
wage 
earners 
by 
allegedly 
pro-labor 
legislation 
or 
by 
giving 
a 
free 
hand 
to 
labor-union 
pressure 
and 
compulsion. 
But 
if 
this 
policy 
does 
not 
result 
in 
a 
corresponding 
rise 
in 
the 
prices 
of 
manufactures, 
thereby 
bringing 
real 
wage 
rates 
back 
to 



the 
market 
level, 
it 
brings 
about 
unemployment 
of 
a 
considerable 
part 
of 
those 
willing 
to 
earn 
wages. 


A 
scrutiny 
of 
such 
policies 
from 
the 
viewpoint 
of 
economic 
theory 
must 
necessarily 
show 
their 
futility. 
This 
is 
why 
economics 
is 
tabooed 
by 
the 
bureaucrats. 
But 
the 
governments 
encourage 
the 
specialists 
who 
limit 
their 
observations 
to 
a 
narrow 
field 
without 
bothering 
about 
the 
further 
consequences 
of 
a 
policy. 
The 
labor 
economist 
deals 
only 
with 
the 
immediate 
results 
of 
pro-labor 
policies, 
the 
farm 
economist 
only 
with 
the 
rise 
of 
agricultural 
prices. 
They 
both 
view 
the 
problems 
only 
from 
the 
angle 
of 
those 
pressure 
groups 
which 
are 
immediately 
favored 
by 
the 
measure 
in 
question 
and 
disregard 
its 
ultimate 
social 
consequences. 
They 
are 
not 
economists, 
but 
expounders 
of 
government 
activities 
in 
a 
particular 
branch 
of 
the 
administration. 


For 
under 
government 
interference 
with 
business 
the 
unity 
of 
government 
policies 
has 
long 
since 
disintegrated 
into 
badly 
coördinated 
parts. 
Gone 
are 
the 
days 
when 
it 
was 
still 
possible 
to 
speak 
of 
a 
government’s 
policy. 
Today 
in 
most 
countries 
each 
department 
follows 
its 
own 
course, 
working 
against 
the 
endeavors 
of 
the 
other 
departments. 
The 
department 
of 
labor 
aims 
at 
higher 
wage 
rates 
and 
at 
lower 
living 
costs. 
But 
the 
same 
administration’s 
department 
of 
agriculture 
aims 
at 
higher 
food 
prices, 
and 
the 
department 
of 
commerce 
tries 
to 
raise 
domestic 
commodity 
prices 
by 
tariffs. 
One 
department 
fights 
against 
monopoly, 
but 
other 
departments 
are 
eager 
to 
bring 
about?by 
tariffs, 
patents, 
and 
other 
means?the 
conditions 
required 
for 
the 
building 
of 
monopolistic 
restraint. 
And 
each 
department 
refers 
to 
the 
expert 
opinion 
of 
those 
specialized 
in 
their 
respective 
fields. 


Thus 
the 
students 
no 
longer 
receive 
an 
initiation 
into 
economics. 
They 
learn 
incoherent 
and 
disconnected 
facts 
about 
various 
government 
measures 
thwarting 
one 
another. 
Their 
doctor’s 
theses 
and 
their 
graduate 
research 
work 
deal 
not 
with 
economics 
but 
with 
various 
topics 
of 
economic 
history 
and 
various 
instances 
of 
government 
interference 
with 
business. 
Such 
detailed 
and 
well-documented 
statistical 
studies 
of 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
immediate 
past 
(mistakenly 
often 
labeled 
studies 
about 
“present-day” 
conditions) 
are 
of 
great 
value 
for 
the 
future 
historian. 
They 
are 
no 
less 
important 
for 
the 
vocational 
tasks 
of 
lawyers 
and 
office 
clerks. 
But 
they 
are 
certainly 
not 
a 



substitute 
for 
the 
lack 
of 
instruction 
in 
economics. 
It 
is 
amazing 
that 
Stresemann’s 
doctoral 
thesis 
dealt 
with 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
bottled-beer 
trade 
in 
Berlin. 
Under 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
German 
university 
curriculum 
this 
meant 
that 
he 
devoted 
a 
considerable 
part 
of 
his 
university 
work 
to 
the 
study 
of 
the 
marketing 
of 
beer 
and 
of 
the 
drinking 
habits 
of 
the 
population. 
This 
was 
the 
intellectual 
equipment 
that 
the 
glorified 
German 
university 
system 
gave 
to 
a 
man 
who 
later 
acted 
as 
the 
Reich’s 
chancellor 
in 
the 
most 
critical 
years 
of 
German 
history. 


After 
the 
old 
professors 
who 
had 
got 
their 
chairs 
in 
the 
short 
flowering 
of 
German 
liberalism 
had 
died, 
it 
became 
impossible 
to 
hear 
anything 
about 
economics 
at 
the 
universities 
of 
the 
Reich. 
There 
were 
no 
longer 
any 
German 
economists, 
and 
the 
books 
of 
foreign 
economists 
could 
not 
be 
found 
in 
the 
libraries 
of 
the 
university 
seminars. 
The 
social 
scientists 
did 
not 
follow 
the 
example 
of 
the 
professors 
of 
theology 
who 
acquainted 
their 
students 
with 
the 
tenets 
and 
dogmas 
of 
other 
churches 
and 
sects 
and 
with 
the 
philosophy 
of 
atheism 
because 
they 
were 
eager 
to 
refute 
the 
creeds 
they 
deemed 
heretical. 
All 
that 
the 
students 
of 
the 
social 
sciences 
learned 
from 
their 
teachers 
was 
that 
economics 
is 
a 
spurious 
science 
and 
that 
the 
so-called 
economists 
are, 
as 
Marx 
said, 
sycophantic 
apologists 
of 
the 
unfair 
class 
interests 
of 
bourgeois 
exploiters, 
ready 
to 
sell 
the 
people 
to 
big 
business 
and 
finance 
capital.3 
The 
graduates 
left 
the 
universities 
convinced 
advocates 
of 
totalitarianism 
either 
of 
the 
Nazi 
variety 
or 
of 
the 
Marxian 
brand. 


Conditions 
in 
other 
countries 
were 
similar. 
The 
most 
eminent 
establishment 
of 
French 
learning 
was 
the 
Ecole 
Normale 
Supérieure 
in 
Paris; 
its 
graduates 
filled 
the 
most 
important 
posts 
in 
public 
administration, 
politics 
and 
higher 
education. 
This 
school 
was 
dominated 
by 
Marxians 
and 
other 
supporters 
of 
full 
government 
control. 
In 
Russia 
the 
Imperial 
Government 
did 
not 
admit 
to 
a 
university 
chair 
anybody 
suspected 
of 
the 
liberal 
ideas 
of 
“Western” 
economics. 
But, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
appointed 
many 
Marxians 
of 
the 
“loyal” 
wing 
of 
Marxism, 
i.e., 
those 
who 
kept 
out 
of 
the 
way 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
fanatics. 
Thus 
the 
Czars 
themselves 
contributed 
to 
the 
later 
triumph 
of 
Marxism. 


European 
totalitarianism 
is 
an 
upshot 
of 
bureaucracy’s 
preëminence 
in 
the 
field 
of 
education. 
The 
universities 
paved 
the 
way 
for 
the 
dictators. 



Today 
both 
in 
Russia 
and 
in 
Germany 
the 
universities 
are 
the 
main 
strongholds 
of 
the 
one-party 
system. 
Not 
only 
the 
social 
sciences, 
history, 
and 
philosophy, 
but 
all 
other 
branches 
of 
knowledge, 
of 
art, 
and 
of 
literature 
are 
regimented 
or, 
as 
the 
Nazis 
say, 
gleichgeschaltet. 
Even 
Sidney 
and 
Beatrice 
Webb, 
naive 
and 
uncritical 
admirers 
of 
the 
Soviets 
as 
they 
are, 
were 
shocked 
when 
they 
discovered 
that 
the 
Journal 
for 
Marxist-Leninist 
Natural 
Sciences 
stands 
“for 
party 
in 
mathematics” 
and 
“for 
the 
purity 
of 
Marxist-
Leninist 
theory 
in 
surgery” 
and 
that 
the 
Soviet 
Herald 
of 
Venereology 
and 
Dermatology 
aims 
at 
considering 
all 
problems 
that 
it 
discusses 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
dialectical 
materialism.4

WHO 
SHOULD 
BE 
THE 
MASTER? 
Under 
any 
system 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
a 
principle 
for 
the 
coördination 
of 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
various 
specialists 
is 
needed. 
The 
specialist’s 
effort 
would 
be 
aimless 
and 
contrary 
to 
purpose 
if 
he 
were 
not 
to 
find 
a 
guide 
in 
the 
supremacy 
of 
the 
public. 
Of 
course, 
production’s 
only 
end 
is 
to 
serve 
the 
consumers. 


Under 
a 
market 
society 
the 
profit 
motive 
is 
the 
directing 
principle. 
Under 
government 
control 
it 
is 
regimentation. 
There 
is 
no 
third 
possibility 
left. 
To 
a 
man 
not 
driven 
by 
the 
impulse 
to 
make 
money 
on 
the 
market 
some 
code 
must 
say 
what 
to 
do 
and 
how. 


One 
of 
the 
most 
frequent 
objections 
raised 
against 
the 
liberal 
and 
democratic 
system 
of 
capitalism 
is 
that 
it 
stresses 
mainly 
the 
individual’s 
rights, 
to 
the 
neglect 
of 
his 
duties. 
People 
stand 
on 
their 
rights 
and 
forget 
their 
obligations. 
However, 
from 
the 
social 
viewpoint 
the 
duties 
of 
the 
citizens 
are 
more 
important 
than 
their 
rights. 


There 
is 
no 
need 
for 
us 
to 
dwell 
upon 
the 
political 
and 
constitutional 
aspect 
of 
this 
antidemocratic 
critique. 
The 
rights 
of 
man 
as 
codified 
in 
the 
various 
bills 
of 
rights 
are 
promulgated 
for 
the 
protection 
of 
the 
individual 
against 
governmental 
arbitrariness. 
But 
for 
them 
all 
people 
would 
be 
slaves 
of 
despotic 
rulers. 


In 
the 
economic 
sphere 
the 
right 
to 
acquire 
and 
to 
own 
property 
is 
not 
a 
privilege. 
It 
is 
the 
principle 
that 
safeguards 
the 
best 
satisfaction 
of 
the 
wants 



of 
the 
consumers. 
He 
who 
is 
eager 
to 
earn, 
to 
acquire, 
and 
to 
hold 
wealth 
is 
under 
the 
necessity 
of 
serving 
the 
consumers. 
The 
profit 
motive 
is 
the 
means 
of 
making 
the 
public 
supreme. 
The 
better 
a 
man 
succeeds 
in 
supplying 
the 
consumers, 
the 
greater 
become 
his 
earnings. 
It 
is 
to 
everybody’s 
advantage 
that 
the 
entrepreneur 
who 
produces 
good 
shoes 
at 
the 
cheapest 
cost 
becomes 
rich; 
most 
people 
would 
suffer 
some 
loss 
if 
a 
law 
were 
to 
limit 
his 
right 
to 
get 
richer. 
Such 
a 
law 
would 
only 
favor 
his 
less 
efficient 
competitors. 
It 
would 
not 
lower 
but 
raise 
the 
price 
of 
shoes. 


Profit 
is 
the 
reward 
for 
the 
best 
fulfillment 
of 
some 
voluntarily 
assumed 
duties. 
It 
is 
the 
instrument 
that 
makes 
the 
masses 
supreme. 
The 
common 
man 
is 
the 
customer 
for 
whom 
the 
captains 
of 
industry 
and 
all 
their 
aides 
are 
working. 


It 
has 
been 
objected 
that 
this 
is 
not 
true 
as 
far 
as 
big 
business 
is 
concerned. 
The 
consumer 
has 
no 
other 
choice 
than 
either 
to 
patronize 
the 
business 
or 
to 
forego 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
a 
vital 
need. 
He 
is 
thus 
forced 
to 
submit 
to 
any 
price 
asked 
by 
the 
entrepreneur. 
Big 
business 
is 
no 
longer 
a 
supplier 
and 
purveyor 
but 
a 
master. 
It 
is 
not 
under 
the 
necessity 
of 
improving 
and 
cheapening 
its 
service. 


Let 
us 
consider 
the 
case 
of 
a 
railroad 
connecting 
two 
cities 
not 
connected 
by 
any 
other 
rail 
line. 
We 
may 
even 
ignore 
the 
fact 
that 
other 
means 
of 
transportation 
are 
in 
competition 
with 
the 
railroad: 
busses, 
passenger 
cars, 
aeroplanes, 
and 
river 
boats. 
Under 
these 
assumptions 
it 
is 
true 
that 
whoever 
wants 
to 
travel 
is 
forced 
to 
patronize 
the 
railroad. 
But 
this 
does 
not 
remove 
the 
company’s 
interest 
in 
good 
and 
cheap 
service. 
Not 
all 
those 
who 
consider 
traveling 
are 
forced 
to 
make 
the 
journey 
under 
any 
conditions. 
The 
number 
of 
passengers 
both 
for 
pleasure 
and 
for 
business 
depends 
on 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
service 
and 
on 
the 
rates 
charged. 
Some 
people 
will 
travel 
in 
any 
case. 
Others 
will 
travel 
only 
if 
the 
quality 
and 
speed 
of 
the 
service 
and 
cheap 
rates 
make 
traveling 
attractive. 
It 
is 
precisely 
this 
second 
group 
whose 
patronage 
means 
for 
the 
company 
the 
difference 
between 
dull 
or 
even 
bad 
business 
and 
profitable 
business. 
If 
this 
is 
true 
for 
a 
railroad 
under 
the 
extreme 
assumptions 
made 
above, 
it 
is 
much 
more 
true 
for 
any 
other 
branch 
of 
business. 


All 
specialists, 
whether 
businessmen 
or 
professional 
people, 
are 
fully 
aware 



of 
their 
dependence 
on 
the 
consumers’ 
directives. 
Daily 
experience 
teaches 
them 
that, 
under 
capitalism, 
their 
main 
task 
is 
to 
serve 
the 
consumers. 
Those 
specialists 
who 
lack 
an 
understanding 
of 
the 
fundamental 
social 
problems 
resent 
very 
deeply 
this 
“servitude” 
and 
want 
to 
be 
freed. 
The 
revolt 
of 
narrow-minded 
experts 
is 
one 
of 
the 
powerful 
forces 
pushing 
toward 
general 
bureaucratization. 


The 
architect 
must 
adjust 
his 
blueprints 
to 
the 
wishes 
of 
those 
for 
whom 
he 
builds 
homes; 
or?in 
the 
case 
of 
apartment 
houses?of 
the 
proprietors 
who 
want 
to 
own 
a 
building 
that 
suits 
the 
tastes 
of 
the 
prospective 
tenants 
and 
can 
therefore 
be 
easily 
rented. 
There 
is 
no 
need 
to 
find 
out 
whether 
the 
architect 
is 
right 
in 
believing 
that 
he 
knows 
better 
what 
a 
fine 
house 
should 
look 
like 
than 
the 
foolish 
laymen 
who 
lack 
good 
taste. 
He 
may 
foam 
with 
rage 
when 
he 
is 
forced 
to 
debase 
his 
wonderful 
projects 
in 
order 
to 
please 
his 
customers. 
And 
he 
yearns 
for 
an 
ideal 
state 
of 
affairs 
in 
which 
he 
could 
build 
homes 
that 
meet 
his 
own 
artistic 
standards. 
He 
longs 
for 
a 
government 
housing 
office 
and 
sees 
himself 
in 
his 
daydreams 
at 
the 
top 
of 
this 
bureau. 
Then 
he 
will 
construct 
dwellings 
according 
to 
his 
own 
fashion. 


This 
architect 
would 
be 
highly 
offended 
if 
somebody 
were 
to 
call 
him 
a 
would-be 
dictator. 
My 
only 
aim, 
he 
could 
retort, 
is 
to 
make 
people 
happy 
by 
providing 
them 
with 
finer 
houses; 
these 
people 
are 
too 
ignorant 
to 
know 
what 
would 
best 
promote 
their 
own 
well-being; 
the 
expert, 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
government, 
must 
take 
care 
of 
them; 
there 
should 
be 
a 
law 
against 
ugly 
buildings. 
But, 
let 
us 
ask, 
who 
is 
to 
decide 
which 
kind 
of 
architectural 
style 
has 
to 
be 
considered 
good 
and 
which 
bad? 
Our 
architect 
will 
answer: 
Of 
course, 
I, 
the 
expert. 
He 
boldly 
disregards 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
is, 
even 
among 
the 
architects, 
very 
considerable 
dissent 
with 
regard 
to 
styles 
and 
artistic 
values. 


We 
do 
not 
want 
to 
stress 
the 
point 
that 
this 
architect, 
even 
under 
a 
bureaucratic 
dictatorship 
and 
precisely 
under 
such 
a 
totalitarianism, 
will 
not 
be 
free 
to 
build 
according 
to 
his 
own 
ideas. 
He 
will 
have 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
tastes 
of 
his 
bureaucratic 
superiors, 
and 
they 
themselves 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
the 
whims 
of 
the 
supreme 
dictator. 
In 
Nazi 
Germany 
the 
architects 
are 
not 
free 
either. 
They 
have 
to 
accommodate 
themselves 
to 
the 
plans 
of 
the 
frustrated 
artist 
Hitler. 



Still 
more 
important 
is 
this. 
There 
are, 
in 
the 
field 
of 
esthetics 
as 
in 
all 
other 
fields 
of 
human 
endeavor, 
no 
absolute 
criteria 
of 
what 
is 
beautiful 
and 
what 
is 
not. 
If 
a 
man 
forces 
his 
fellow 
citizens 
to 
submit 
to 
his 
own 
standards 
of 
value, 
he 
does 
not 
make 
them 
any 
happier. 
They 
themselves 
alone 
can 
decide 
what 
makes 
them 
happy 
and 
what 
they 
like. 
You 
do 
not 
increase 
the 
happiness 
of 
a 
man 
eager 
to 
attend 
a 
performance 
of 
Abie’s 
Irish 
Rose 
by 
forcing 
him 
to 
attend 
a 
perfect 
performance 
of 
Hamlet 
instead. 
You 
may 
deride 
his 
poor 
taste. 
But 
he 
alone 
is 
supreme 
in 
matters 
of 
his 
own 
satisfaction. 


The 
dictatorial 
nutrition 
expert 
wants 
to 
feed 
his 
fellow 
citizens 
according 
to 
his 
own 
ideas 
about 
perfect 
alimentation. 
He 
wants 
to 
deal 
with 
men 
as 
the 
cattle 
breeder 
deals 
with 
his 
cows. 
He 
fails 
to 
realize 
that 
nutrition 
is 
not 
an 
end 
in 
itself 
but 
the 
means 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
other 
ends. 
The 
farmer 
does 
not 
feed 
his 
cow 
in 
order 
to 
make 
it 
happy 
but 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
some 
end 
which 
the 
well-fed 
cow 
should 
serve. 
There 
are 
various 
schemes 
for 
feeding 
cows. 
Which 
one 
of 
them 
he 
chooses 
depends 
on 
whether 
he 
wants 
to 
get 
as 
much 
milk 
as 
possible 
or 
as 
much 
meat 
as 
possible 
or 
something 
else. 
Every 
dictator 
plans 
to 
rear, 
raise, 
feed, 
and 
train 
his 
fellow 
men 
as 
the 
breeder 
does 
his 
cattle. 
His 
aim 
is 
not 
to 
make 
the 
people 
happy 
but 
to 
bring 
them 
into 
a 
condition 
which 
renders 
him, 
the 
dictator, 
happy. 
He 
wants 
to 
domesticate 
them, 
to 
give 
them 
cattle 
status. 
The 
cattle 
breeder 
also 
is 
a 
benevolent 
despot. 


The 
question 
is: 
Who 
should 
be 
the 
master? 
Should 
man 
be 
free 
to 
choose 
his 
own 
road 
toward 
what 
he 
thinks 
will 
make 
him 
happy? 
Or 
should 
a 
dictator 
use 
his 
fellow 
men 
as 
pawns 
in 
his 
endeavors 
to 
make 
himself, 
the 
dictator, 
happier? 


We 
may 
admit 
that 
some 
experts 
are 
right 
in 
telling 
us 
that 
most 
people 
behave 
foolishly 
in 
their 
pursuit 
of 
happiness. 
But 
you 
cannot 
make 
a 
man 
happier 
by 
putting 
him 
under 
guardianship. 
The 
experts 
of 
the 
various 
government 
agencies 
are 
certainly 
fine 
men. 
But 
they 
are 
not 
right 
in 
becoming 
indignant 
whenever 
the 
legislature 
frustrates 
their 
carefully 
elaborated 
designs. 
What 
is 
the 
use 
of 
representative 
government, 
they 
ask; 
it 
merely 
thwarts 
our 
good 
intentions. 
But 
the 
only 
question 
is: 
Who 
should 
run 
the 
country? 
The 
voters 
or 
the 
bureaucrats? 



Every 
half-wit 
can 
use 
a 
whip 
and 
force 
other 
people 
to 
obey. 
But 
it 
requires 
brains 
and 
diligence 
to 
serve 
the 
public. 
Only 
a 
few 
people 
succeed 
in 
producing 
shoes 
better 
and 
cheaper 
than 
their 
competitors. 
The 
inefficient 
expert 
will 
always 
aim 
at 
bureaucratic 
supremacy. 
He 
is 
fully 
aware 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
cannot 
succeed 
within 
a 
competitive 
system. 
For 
him 
all-round 
bureaucratization 
is 
a 
refuge. 
Equipped 
with 
the 
power 
of 
an 
office 
he 
will 
enforce 
his 
rulings 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
police. 


At 
the 
bottom 
of 
all 
this 
fanatical 
advocacy 
of 
planning 
and 
socialism 
there 
is 
often 
nothing 
else 
than 
the 
intimate 
consciousness 
of 
one’s 
own 
inferiority 
and 
inefficiency. 
The 
man 
who 
is 
aware 
of 
his 
inability 
to 
stand 
competition 
scorns 
“this 
mad 
competitive 
system.” 
He 
who 
is 
unfit 
to 
serve 
his 
fellow 
citizens 
wants 
to 
rule 
them.

THE 
PSYCHOLOGICAL 
CONSEQUENCES 
OF 
BUREAUCRATIZATION 



1. 
THE 
GERMAN 
YOUTH 
MOVEMENT 
HIGH-BROWS 
turn 
up 
their 
noses 
at 
Horatio 
Alger’s 
philosophy. 
Yet 
Alger 
succeeded 
better 
than 
anybody 
else 
in 
stressing 
the 
most 
characteristic 
point 
of 
capitalist 
society. 
Capitalism 
is 
a 
system 
under 
which 
everybody 
has 
the 
chance 
of 
acquiring 
wealth; 
it 
gives 
everybody 
unlimited 
opportunity. 
Not 
everybody, 
of 
course, 
is 
favored 
by 
good 
luck. 
Very 
few 
become 
millionaires. 
But 
everybody 
knows 
that 
strenuous 
effort 
and 
nothing 
less 
than 
strenuous 
effort 
pays. 
All 
roads 
are 
open 
to 
the 
smart 
youngster. 
He 
is 
optimistic 
in 
the 
awareness 
of 
his 
own 
strength. 
He 
has 
self-confidence 
and 
is 
full 
of 
hope. 
And 
as 
he 
grows 
older 
and 
realizes 
that 
many 
of 
his 
plans 
have 
been 
frustrated, 
he 
has 
no 
cause 
for 
despair. 
His 
children 
will 
start 
the 
race 
again 
and 
he 
does 
not 
see 
any 
reason 
why 
they 
should 
not 
succeed 
where 
he 
himself 
failed. 
Life 
is 
worth 
living 
because 
it 
is 
full 
of 
promise. 


All 
this 
was 
literally 
true 
of 
America. 
In 
old 
Europe 
there 
still 
survived 
many 
checks 
inherited 
from 
the 
ancien 
régime. 
Even 
in 
the 
prime 
of 
liberalism, 
aristocracy 
and 
officialdom 
were 
struggling 
for 
the 
maintenance 
of 
their 
privileges. 
But 
in 
America 
there 
were 
no 
such 
remnants 
of 
the 
Dark 
Ages. 
It 
was 
in 
this 
sense 
a 
young 
country, 
and 
it 
was 
a 
free 
country. 
Here 
were 
neither 
industrial 
codes 
nor 
guilds. 
Thomas 
Alva 
Edison 
and 
Henry 
Ford 
did 
not 
have 
to 
overcome 
any 
obstacles 
erected 
by 
shortsighted 
governments 
and 
a 
narrow-minded 
public 
opinion. 


Under 
such 
conditions 
the 
rising 
generation 
are 
driven 
by 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
pioneer. 
They 
are 
born 
into 
a 
progressing 
society, 
and 
they 
realize 
that 
it 
is 
their 
task 
to 
contribute 
something 
to 
the 
improvement 
of 
human 
affairs. 
They 
will 
change 
the 
world, 
shape 
it 
according 
to 
their 
own 
ideas. 
They 
have 
no 
time 
to 
waste, 
tomorrow 
is 
theirs 
and 
they 
must 
prepare 
for 
the 
great 
things 
that 
are 
waiting 
for 
them. 
They 
do 
not 
talk 
about 
their 
being 
young 
and 
about 
the 
rights 
of 
youth; 
they 
act 
as 
young 
people 
must 
act. 
They 
do 
not 
boast 
about 
their 
own 
“dynamism”; 
they 
are 
dynamic 
and 
there 
is 
no 
need 
for 
them 
to 
emphasize 
this 
quality. 
They 
do 
not 
challenge 
the 
older 
generation 
with 
arrogant 
talk. 
They 
want 
to 
beat 
it 
by 
their 
deeds. 



But 
it 
is 
quite 
a 
different 
thing 
under 
the 
rising 
tide 
of 
bureaucratization. 
Government 
jobs 
offer 
no 
opportunity 
for 
the 
display 
of 
personal 
talents 
and 
gifts. 
Regimentation 
spells 
the 
doom 
of 
initiative. 
The 
young 
man 
has 
no 
illusions 
about 
his 
future. 
He 
knows 
what 
is 
in 
store 
for 
him. 
He 
will 
get 
a 
job 
with 
one 
of 
the 
innumerable 
bureaus, 
he 
will 
be 
but 
a 
cog 
in 
a 
huge 
machine 
the 
working 
of 
which 
is 
more 
or 
less 
mechanical. 
The 
routine 
of 
a 
bureaucratic 
technique 
will 
cripple 
his 
mind 
and 
tie 
his 
hands. 
He 
will 
enjoy 
security. 
But 
this 
security 
will 
be 
rather 
of 
the 
kind 
that 
the 
convict 
enjoys 
within 
the 
prison 
walls. 
He 
will 
never 
be 
free 
to 
make 
decisions 
and 
to 
shape 
his 
own 
fate. 
He 
will 
forever 
be 
a 
man 
taken 
care 
of 
by 
other 
people. 
He 
will 
never 
be 
a 
real 
man 
relying 
on 
his 
own 
strength. 
He 
shudders 
at 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
huge 
office 
buildings 
in 
which 
he 
will 
bury 
himself. 


In 
the 
decade 
preceding 
the 
First 
World 
War 
Germany, 
the 
country 
most 
advanced 
on 
the 
path 
toward 
bureaucratic 
regimentation, 
witnessed 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
phenomenon 
hitherto 
unheard 
of: 
the 
youth 
movement. 
Turbulent 
gangs 
of 
untidy 
boys 
and 
girls 
roamed 
the 
country, 
making 
much 
noise 
and 
shirking 
their 
school 
lessons. 
In 
bombastic 
words 
they 
announced 
the 
gospel 
of 
a 
golden 
age. 
All 
preceding 
generations, 
they 
emphasized, 
were 
simply 
idiotic; 
their 
incapacity 
has 
converted 
the 
earth 
into 
a 
hell. 
But 
the 
rising 
generation 
is 
no 
longer 
willing 
to 
endure 
gerontocracy, 
the 
supremacy 
of 
impotent 
and 
imbecile 
senility. 
Henceforth 
the 
brilliant 
youths 
will 
rule. 
They 
will 
destroy 
everything 
that 
is 
old 
and 
useless, 
they 
will 
reject 
all 
that 
was 
dear 
to 
their 
parents, 
they 
will 
substitute 
new 
real 
and 
substantial 
values 
and 
ideologies 
for 
the 
antiquated 
and 
false 
ones 
of 
capitalist 
and 
bourgeois 
civilization, 
and 
they 
will 
build 
a 
new 
society 
of 
giants 
and 
supermen. 


The 
inflated 
verbiage 
of 
these 
adolescents 
was 
only 
a 
poor 
disguise 
for 
their 
lack 
of 
any 
ideas 
and 
of 
any 
definite 
program. 
They 
had 
nothing 
to 
say 
but 
this: 
We 
are 
young 
and 
therefore 
chosen; 
we 
are 
ingenious 
because 
we 
are 
young; 
we 
are 
the 
carriers 
of 
the 
future; 
we 
are 
the 
deadly 
foes 
of 
the 
rotten 
bourgeois 
and 
Philistines. 
And 
if 
somebody 
was 
not 
afraid 
to 
ask 
them 
what 
their 
plans 
were, 
they 
knew 
only 
one 
answer: 
Our 
leaders 
will 
solve 
all 
problems. 


It 
has 
always 
been 
the 
task 
of 
the 
new 
generation 
to 
provoke 
changes. 
But 
the 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
the 
youth 
movement 
was 
that 
they 
had 
neither 
new 



ideas 
nor 
plans. 
They 
called 
their 
action 
the 
youth 
movement 
precisely 
because 
they 
lacked 
any 
program 
which 
they 
could 
use 
to 
give 
a 
name 
to 
their 
endeavors. 
In 
fact 
they 
espoused 
entirely 
the 
program 
of 
their 
parents. 
They 
did 
not 
oppose 
the 
trend 
toward 
government 
omnipotence 
and 
bureaucratization. 
Their 
revolutionary 
radicalism 
was 
nothing 
but 
the 
impudence 
of 
the 
years 
between 
boyhood 
and 
manhood; 
it 
was 
a 
phenomenon 
of 
a 
protracted 
puberty. 
It 
was 
void 
of 
any 
ideological 
content. 


The 
chiefs 
of 
the 
youth 
movement 
were 
mentally 
unbalanced 
neurotics. 
Many 
of 
them 
were 
affected 
by 
a 
morbid 
sexuality, 
they 
were 
either 
profligate 
or 
homosexual. 
None 
of 
them 
excelled 
in 
any 
field 
of 
activity 
or 
contributed 
anything 
to 
human 
progress. 
Their 
names 
are 
long 
since 
forgotten; 
the 
only 
trace 
they 
left 
were 
some 
books 
and 
poems 
preaching 
sexual 
perversity. 
But 
the 
bulk 
of 
their 
followers 
were 
quite 
different. 
They 
had 
one 
aim 
only: 
to 
get 
a 
job 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
with 
the 
government. 
Those 
who 
were 
not 
killed 
in 
the 
wars 
and 
revolutions 
are 
today 
pedantic 
and 
timid 
bureaucrats 
in 
the 
innumerable 
offices 
of 
the 
German 
Zwangswirtschaft. 
They 
are 
obedient 
and 
faithful 
slaves 
of 
Hitler. 
But 
they 
will 
be 
no 
less 
obedient 
and 
faithful 
handy 
men 
of 
Hitler’s 
successor, 
whether 
he 
is 
a 
German 
nationalist 
or 
a 
puppet 
of 
Stalin. 


From 
Germany 
the 
youth 
movement 
spread 
to 
other 
countries. 
Italian 
Fascism 
masked 
itself 
as 
a 
youth 
movement. 
Its 
party 
song, 
“Giovinezza,” 
is 
a 
hymn 
of 
youth. 
Its 
buffoon 
Duce 
boasted 
still 
in 
his 
late 
fifties 
of 
his 
youthful 
vigor 
and 
was 
anxious 
to 
conceal 
his 
age 
like 
a 
coquettish 
lady. 
But 
the 
only 
concern 
of 
the 
rank-and-file 
Fascist 
was 
to 
get 
a 
government 
job. 
In 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Ethiopian 
war 
the 
present 
writer 
asked 
some 
graduate 
students 
of 
one 
of 
the 
great 
Italian 
universities 
for 
an 
explanation 
of 
their 
hostility 
to 
France 
and 
Great 
Britain. 
The 
answer 
was 
amazing: 
“Italy,” 
they 
said, 
“does 
not 
offer 
enough 
opportunity 
for 
its 
intelligentsia. 
We 
want 
to 
conquer 
British 
and 
French 
colonies 
in 
order 
to 
get 
in 
the 
administration 
of 
these 
territories 
the 
jobs 
which 
are 
now 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
British 
and 
French 
bureaucrats.” 


The 
youth 
movement 
was 
an 
expression 
of 
the 
uneasiness 
that 
young 
people 
felt 
in 
face 
of 
the 
gloomy 
prospects 
that 
the 
general 
trend 
toward 
regimentation 
offered 
them. 
But 
it 
was 
a 
counterfeit 
rebellion 
doomed 
to 
failure 
because 
it 
did 
not 
dare 
to 
fight 
seriously 
against 
the 
growing 
menace 



of 
government 
all-round 
control 
and 
totalitarianism. 
The 
tumultuous 
would-
be 
rioters 
were 
impotent 
because 
they 
were 
under 
the 
spell 
of 
the 
totalitarian 
superstitions. 
They 
indulged 
in 
seditious 
babble 
and 
chanted 
inflammatory 
songs, 
but 
they 
wanted 
first 
of 
all 
government 
jobs. 


Today 
the 
youth 
movement 
is 
dead 
in 
the 
countries 
most 
advanced 
on 
the 
way 
toward 
totalitarianism. 
In 
Russia, 
in 
Germany, 
and 
in 
Italy 
the 
children 
and 
the 
adolescents 
are 
firmly 
integrated 
into 
the 
all-embracing 
apparatus 
of 
state 
control. 
Children 
from 
the 
tenderest 
age 
are 
members 
of 
the 
political 
organizations. 
From 
the 
cradle 
to 
the 
grave 
all 
citizens 
are 
subject 
to 
the 
machine 
of 
the 
one-party 
system, 
bound 
to 
obey 
without 
asking 
questions. 
No 
“private” 
associations 
or 
gatherings 
are 
permitted. 
The 
official 
apparatus 
does 
not 
tolerate 
any 
competition. 
The 
official 
ideology 
does 
not 
tolerate 
any 
dissenters. 
Such 
is 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
bureaucratic 
utopia. 


2. 
THE 
FATE 
OF 
THE 
RISING 
GENERATION 
WITHIN 
A 
BUREAUCRATIC 
ENVIRONMENT 
The 
youth 
movement 
was 
an 
impotent 
and 
abortive 
revolt 
of 
youth 
against 
the 
menace 
of 
bureaucratization. 
It 
was 
doomed 
because 
it 
did 
not 
attack 
the 
seed 
of 
the 
evil, 
the 
trend 
toward 
socialization. 
It 
was 
in 
fact 
nothing 
but 
a 
confused 
expression 
of 
uneasiness, 
without 
any 
clear 
ideas 
and 
definite 
plans. 
The 
revolting 
adolescents 
were 
so 
completely 
under 
the 
spell 
of 
socialist 
ideas 
that 
they 
simply 
did 
not 
know 
what 
they 
wanted. 


It 
is 
evident 
that 
youth 
is 
the 
first 
victim 
of 
the 
trend 
toward 
bureaucratization. 
The 
young 
men 
are 
deprived 
of 
any 
opportunity 
to 
shape 
their 
own 
fate. 
For 
them 
there 
is 
no 
chance 
left. 
They 
are 
in 
fact 
“lost 
generations” 
for 
they 
lack 
the 
most 
precious 
right 
of 
every 
rising 
generation, 
the 
right 
to 
contribute 
something 
new 
to 
the 
old 
inventory 
of 
civilization. 
The 
slogan: 
Mankind 
has 
reached 
the 
stage 
of 
maturity, 
is 
their 
undoing. 
What 
are 
young 
people 
to 
whom 
nothing 
is 
left 
to 
change 
and 
to 
improve? 
Whose 
only 
prospect 
is 
to 
start 
at 
the 
lowest 
rung 
of 
the 
bureaucratic 
ladder 
and 
to 
climb 
slowly 
in 
strict 
observance 
of 
the 
rules 
formulated 
by 
older 
superiors? 
Seen 
from 
their 
viewpoint 
bureaucratization 
means 
subjection 
of 
the 
young 
to 
the 
domination 
of 
the 
old. 
This 
amounts 
to 
a 
return 
to 
a 
sort 
of 
caste 
system. 


Among 
all 
nations 
and 
civilizations?in 
the 
ages 
preceding 
the 
rise 
of 
modern 



liberalism 
and 
its 
offspring, 
capitalism?society 
was 
based 
on 
status. 
The 
nation 
was 
divided 
into 
castes. 
There 
were 
privileged 
castes 
such 
as 
kings 
and 
noblemen, 
and 
underprivileged 
castes 
such 
as 
serfs 
and 
slaves. 
A 
man 
was 
born 
into 
a 
definite 
caste, 
remained 
in 
it 
throughout 
his 
whole 
life 
and 
bequeathed 
his 
caste 
status 
to 
his 
children. 
He 
who 
was 
born 
into 
one 
of 
the 
lower 
castes 
was 
forever 
deprived 
of 
the 
right 
to 
attain 
one 
of 
the 
stations 
of 
life 
reserved 
to 
the 
privileged. 
Liberalism 
and 
capitalism 
abolished 
all 
such 
discrimination 
and 
made 
all 
people 
equal 
under 
the 
law. 
Now 
virtually 
everybody 
was 
free 
to 
compete 
for 
every 
place 
in 
the 
community. 


Marxism 
provides 
a 
different 
interpretation 
of 
liberalism’s 
achievements. 
The 
main 
dogma 
of 
Karl 
Marx 
is 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
irreconcilable 
conflict 
of 
economic 
classes. 
Capitalist 
society 
is 
divided 
into 
classes 
the 
interests 
of 
which 
are 
antagonistic. 
Thus 
the 
class 
struggle 
is 
inevitable. 
It 
will 
disappear 
only 
in 
the 
future 
classless 
society 
of 
socialism. 


The 
most 
remarkable 
fact 
about 
this 
doctrine 
is 
that 
it 
has 
never 
been 
explicitly 
expounded. 
In 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto 
the 
instances 
used 
for 
the 
exemplification 
of 
class 
struggles 
are 
taken 
from 
the 
conflict 
between 
castes. 
Then 
Marx 
adds 
that 
the 
modern 
bourgeois 
society 
has 
established 
new 
classes. 
But 
he 
never 
said 
what 
a 
class 
is 
and 
what 
he 
had 
in 
mind 
in 
speaking 
of 
classes 
and 
class 
antagonisms 
and 
in 
coördinating 
classes 
to 
castes. 
All 
his 
writings 
center 
around 
these 
never-defined 
terms. 
Although 
indefatigable 
in 
publishing 
books 
and 
articles 
full 
of 
sophisticated 
definitions 
and 
scholastic 
hairsplitting, 
Marx 
never 
attempted 
to 
explain 
in 
unambiguous 
language 
what 
the 
characteristic 
mark 
of 
an 
economic 
class 
is. 
When 
he 
died, 
thirty-five 
years 
after 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto, 
he 
left 
the 
manuscript 
of 
the 
third 
volume 
of 
his 
main 
treatise, 
Capital, 
unfinished. 
And, 
very 
significantly, 
the 
manuscript 
breaks 
off 
just 
at 
the 
point 
at 
which 
the 
explanation 
of 
this 
fundamental 
notion 
of 
his 
entire 
philosophy 
was 
to 
be 
given. 
Neither 
Marx 
nor 
any 
one 
of 
the 
host 
of 
Marxian 
writers 
could 
tell 
us 
what 
a 
social 
class 
is, 
much 
less 
whether 
such 
social 
classes 
really 
play 
in 
the 
social 
structure 
the 
role 
assigned 
to 
them 
in 
the 
doctrine. 


Of 
course, 
from 
the 
logical 
viewpoint 
it 
is 
permissible 
to 
classify 
things 
according 
to 
any 
trait 
chosen. 
The 
question 
is 
only 
whether 
a 
classification 
on 
the 
ground 
of 
the 
traits 
selected 
is 
useful 
for 
further 
investigation 
and 
for 
the 



clarification 
and 
amplification 
of 
our 
knowledge. 
The 
question 
is 
therefore 
not 
whether 
the 
Marxian 
classes 
really 
exist, 
but 
whether 
they 
really 
have 
the 
importance 
attached 
to 
them 
by 
Marx. 
Marx 
failed 
to 
provide 
a 
precise 
definition 
of 
the 
concept 
social 
class 
that 
he 
had 
used 
in 
all 
his 
writings 
in 
a 
loose 
and 
uncertain 
way, 
because 
a 
clear 
definition 
would 
have 
unmasked 
its 
futility 
and 
its 
valuelessness 
for 
dealing 
with 
economic 
and 
social 
problems 
and 
the 
absurdity 
of 
coördinating 
it 
to 
social 
castes. 


The 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
a 
caste 
is 
its 
rigidity. 
The 
social 
classes, 
as 
Marx 
exemplified 
them 
in 
calling 
the 
capitalists, 
the 
entrepreneurs, 
and 
the 
wage 
earners 
distinct 
classes, 
are 
characterized 
by 
their 
flexibility. 
There 
is 
a 
perpetual 
change 
in 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
various 
classes. 
Where 
today 
are 
the 
scions 
of 
those 
who 
in 
the 
days 
of 
Marx 
were 
entrepreneurs? 
And 
where 
were 
the 
ancestors 
of 
the 
contemporary 
entrepreneurs 
in 
the 
days 
of 
Marx? 
Access 
to 
the 
various 
stations 
of 
modern 
capitalist 
society 
is 
open 
to 
everyone. 
We 
may 
call 
the 
United 
States 
senators 
a 
class 
without 
violating 
logical 
principles. 
But 
it 
would 
be 
a 
mistake 
to 
coördinate 
them 
to 
a 
hereditary 
aristocratic 
caste, 
notwithstanding 
the 
fact 
that 
some 
senators 
may 
be 
descendants 
of 
senators 
of 
earlier 
days. 


The 
point 
has 
already 
been 
stressed 
that 
the 
anonymous 
forces 
operating 
on 
the 
market 
are 
continuously 
determining 
anew 
who 
should 
be 
entrepreneur 
and 
who 
should 
be 
capitalist. 
The 
consumers 
vote, 
as 
it 
were, 
for 
those 
who 
are 
to 
occupy 
the 
exalted 
positions 
in 
the 
setting 
of 
the 
nation’s 
economic 
structure. 


Now 
under 
socialism 
there 
are 
neither 
entrepreneurs 
nor 
capitalists. 
In 
this 
sense, 
namely, 
that 
what 
Marx 
called 
a 
class 
will 
no 
longer 
exist, 
he 
was 
right 
to 
call 
socialism 
a 
classless 
society. 
But 
this 
is 
of 
no 
avail. 
There 
will 
be 
other 
differences 
in 
social 
functions 
which 
we 
can 
call 
classes 
with 
surely 
no 
less 
justification 
than 
that 
of 
Marx. 
There 
will 
be 
those 
who 
issue 
orders 
and 
those 
who 
are 
bound 
to 
obey 
these 
orders 
unconditionally; 
there 
will 
be 
those 
who 
make 
plans 
and 
those 
whose 
job 
it 
is 
to 
execute 
these 
plans. 


The 
only 
thing 
that 
counts 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
under 
capitalism 
everybody 
is 
the 
architect 
of 
his 
own 
fortune. 
A 
boy 
eager 
to 
improve 
his 
own 
lot 
must 
rely 
on 
his 
own 
strength 
and 
effort. 
The 
vote 
of 
the 
consumers 
passes 
judgment 
without 
respect 
to 
persons. 
The 
achievements 
of 
the 
candidate, 
not 
his 



person, 
are 
valued. 
Work 
well 
done 
and 
services 
well 
rendered 
are 
the 
only 
means 
to 
succeed. 


Under 
socialism, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
beginner 
must 
please 
those 
already 
settled. 
They 
do 
not 
like 
too 
efficient 
newcomers. 
(Neither 
do 
old-established 
entrepreneurs 
like 
such 
men; 
but, 
under 
the 
supremacy 
of 
the 
consumers, 
they 
cannot 
prevent 
their 
competition.) 
In 
the 
bureaucratic 
machine 
of 
socialism 
the 
way 
toward 
promotion 
is 
not 
achievement 
but 
the 
favor 
of 
the 
superiors. 
The 
youth 
depends 
entirely 
on 
the 
kind 
disposition 
of 
the 
old 
men. 
The 
rising 
generation 
is 
at 
the 
mercy 
of 
the 
aged. 


It 
is 
useless 
to 
deny 
this 
fact. 
There 
are 
no 
Marxian 
classes 
within 
a 
socialist 
society. 
But 
there 
is 
an 
irreconcilable 
conflict 
between 
those 
who 
are 
in 
favor 
with 
Stalin 
and 
Hitler 
and 
those 
who 
are 
not. 
And 
it 
is 
simply 
human 
for 
a 
dictator 
to 
prefer 
those 
who 
share 
his 
opinions 
and 
praise 
his 
work 
to 
those 
who 
do 
not. 


It 
was 
in 
vain 
that 
the 
Italian 
Fascists 
made 
a 
hymn 
to 
youth 
their 
party 
song 
and 
that 
the 
Austrian 
socialists 
taught 
the 
children 
to 
sing: 
“We 
are 
young 
and 
this 
is 
fine.” 
It 
is 
not 
fine 
to 
be 
a 
young 
man 
under 
bureaucratic 
management. 
The 
only 
right 
that 
young 
people 
enjoy 
under 
this 
system 
is 
to 
be 
docile, 
submissive, 
and 
obedient. 
There 
is 
no 
room 
for 
unruly 
innovators 
who 
have 
their 
own 
ideas. 


This 
is 
more 
than 
a 
crisis 
of 
the 
youth. 
It 
is 
a 
crisis 
of 
progress 
and 
civilization. 
Mankind 
is 
doomed 
when 
the 
youths 
are 
deprived 
of 
the 
opportunity 
to 
remodel 
society 
according 
to 
their 
own 
fashion. 



3. 
AUTHORITARIAN 
GUARDIANSHIP 
AND 
PROGRESS 
Paternal 
government 
by 
an 
order 
of 
lofty 
and 
wise 
men, 
by 
any 
elite 
of 
noble 
bureaucrats, 
can 
claim 
a 
very 
eminent 
champion, 
Plato. 


Plato’s 
ideal 
and 
perfect 
state 
is 
to 
be 
ruled 
by 
unselfish 
philosophers. 
They 
are 
unbribable 
judges 
and 
impartial 
administrators, 
strictly 
abiding 
by 
the 
eternal 
immutable 
laws 
of 
justice. 
For 
this 
is 
the 
characteristic 
mark 
of 
Plato’s 
philosophy: 
it 
does 
not 
pay 
any 
attention 
to 
the 
evolution 
of 
social 
and 
economic 
conditions 
and 
to 
changes 
in 
human 
ideas 
concerning 
ends 
and 
means. 
There 
exists 
the 
perennial 
pattern 
of 
the 
good 
state, 
and 
every 
deviation 
of 
actual 
conditions 
from 
this 
model 
cannot 
be 
anything 
else 
than 
corruption 
and 
degradation. 
The 
problem 
is 
simply 
to 
establish 
the 
perfect 
society 
and 
then 
to 
keep 
it 
from 
any 
alteration, 
as 
change 
must 
be 
tantamount 
to 
deterioration. 
Social 
and 
economic 
institutions 
are 
rigid. 
The 
notion 
of 
progress 
in 
knowledge, 
in 
technological 
procedures, 
in 
business 
methods, 
and 
in 
social 
organization 
is 
foreign 
to 
Plato’s 
mind. 
And 
all 
later 
utopians 
who 
shaped 
the 
blueprints 
of 
their 
earthly 
paradises 
according 
to 
Plato’s 
example 
in 
the 
same 
way 
believed 
in 
the 
immutability 
of 
human 
affairs. 


Plato’s 
ideal 
of 
elite 
rule 
has 
been 
converted 
into 
fact 
by 
the 
Catholic 
Church. 
The 
Roman 
Church, 
under 
the 
Tridentine 
organization 
as 
it 
emerged 
from 
the 
Counter-Reformation, 
is 
a 
perfect 
bureaucracy. 
It 
has 
successfully 
solved 
the 
most 
delicate 
problem 
of 
every 
nondemocratic 
government, 
the 
selection 
of 
the 
top 
executives. 
To 
every 
boy 
access 
to 
the 
highest 
dignities 
of 
the 
Church 
is 
virtually 
open. 
The 
local 
priest 
is 
anxious 
to 
smooth 
the 
way 
to 
education 
for 
the 
most 
intelligent 
youths 
of 
his 
parish; 
they 
are 
trained 
in 
the 
Bishop’s 
seminary; 
once 
ordained, 
their 
further 
career 
depends 
entirely 
upon 
their 
character, 
their 
zeal, 
and 
their 
intellect. 
There 
are 
among 
the 
prelates 
many 
scions 
of 
noble 
and 
wealthy 
families. 
But 
they 
do 
not 
owe 
their 
office 
to 
their 
ancestry. 
They 
have 
to 
compete, 
on 
almost 
equal 
terms, 
with 
the 
sons 
of 
poor 
peasants, 
workers, 
and 
serfs. 
The 
princes 
of 
the 
Catholic 
Church, 
the 
abbots 
and 
the 
teachers 
of 
the 
theological 
universities, 
are 
a 
body 
of 
eminent 
men. 
Even 
in 
the 
most 
advanced 
countries 
they 
are 
worthy 
rivals 
of 
the 
most 



brilliant 
scholars, 
philosophers, 
scientists, 
and 
statesmen. 


It 
is 
to 
this 
marvelous 
instance 
that 
the 
authors 
of 
all 
modern 
socialist 
utopias 
refer 
as 
an 
example. 
The 
case 
is 
manifest 
with 
two 
forerunners 
of 
present-day 
socialism: 
Count 
Henri 
de 
Saint-Simon 
and 
Auguste 
Comte. 
But 
it 
was 
essentially 
the 
same 
with 
most 
other 
socialist 
authors, 
although 
for 
obvious 
reasons 
they 
did 
not 
point 
to 
the 
Church 
as 
a 
model. 
No 
precedent 
of 
a 
perfect 
hierarchy 
could 
be 
found 
other 
than 
that 
presented 
by 
Catholicism. 


However, 
the 
reference 
to 
the 
Church 
is 
fallacious. 
The 
realm 
of 
Christianity 
which 
the 
Pope 
and 
the 
other 
Bishops 
administer 
is 
not 
subject 
to 
any 
change. 
It 
is 
built 
upon 
a 
perennial 
and 
immutable 
doctrine. 
The 
creed 
is 
fixed 
forever. 
There 
is 
no 
progress 
and 
no 
evolution. 
There 
is 
only 
obedience 
to 
the 
law 
and 
the 
dogma. 
The 
methods 
of 
selection 
adopted 
by 
the 
Church 
are 
very 
efficient 
in 
the 
government 
of 
a 
body 
clinging 
to 
an 
undisputed, 
unchangeable 
set 
of 
rules 
and 
regulations. 
They 
are 
perfect 
in 
the 
choice 
of 
the 
guardians 
of 
an 
eternal 
treasure 
of 
doctrine. 


But 
the 
case 
of 
human 
society 
and 
civil 
government 
is 
different. 
It 
is 
the 
most 
precious 
privilege 
of 
man 
to 
strive 
ceaselessly 
for 
improvement 
and 
to 
fight 
by 
improved 
methods 
against 
the 
obstacles 
that 
nature 
opposes 
to 
his 
life 
and 
welfare. 
This 
innate 
impulse 
has 
transformed 
the 
descendants 
of 
crude 
cave 
dwellers 
into 
the 
somewhat 
civilized 
men 
of 
our 
age. 
But 
mankind 
has 
not 
yet 
reached 
a 
state 
of 
perfection 
beyond 
which 
no 
further 
progress 
is 
possible. 
The 
forces 
that 
brought 
about 
our 
present 
civilization 
are 
not 
dead. 
If 
not 
tied 
by 
a 
rigid 
system 
of 
social 
organization, 
they 
will 
go 
on 
and 
bring 
further 
improvement. 
The 
selective 
principle 
according 
to 
which 
the 
Catholic 
Church 
chooses 
its 
future 
chiefs 
is 
unswerving 
devotion 
to 
the 
creed 
and 
its 
dogmas. 
It 
does 
not 
look 
for 
innovators 
and 
reformers, 
for 
pioneers 
of 
new 
ideas 
radically 
opposed 
to 
the 
old 
ones. 
This 
is 
what 
the 
appointment 
of 
the 
future 
top 
executives 
by 
the 
old 
and 
well-tried 
present 
rulers 
can 
safeguard. 
No 
bureaucratic 
system 
can 
achieve 
anything 
else. 
But 
it 
is 
precisely 
this 
adamant 
conservatism 
that 
makes 
bureaucratic 
methods 
utterly 
inadequate 
for 
the 
conduct 
of 
social 
and 
economic 
affairs. 


Bureaucratization 
is 
necessarily 
rigid 
because 
it 
involves 
the 
observation 
of 
established 
rules 
and 
practices. 
But 
in 
social 
life 
rigidity 
amounts 
to 
petrification 
and 
death. 
It 
is 
a 
very 
significant 
fact 
that 
stability 
and 
security 



are 
the 
most 
cherished 
slogans 
of 
present-day 
“reformers.” 
If 
primitive 
men 
had 
adopted 
the 
principle 
of 
stability, 
they 
would 
never 
have 
gained 
security; 
they 
would 
long 
since 
have 
been 
wiped 
out 
by 
beasts 
of 
prey 
and 
microbes. 


German 
Marxians 
coined 
the 
dictum: 
If 
socialism 
is 
against 
human 
nature, 
then 
human 
nature 
must 
be 
changed. 
They 
did 
not 
realize 
that 
if 
man’s 
nature 
is 
changed, 
he 
ceases 
to 
be 
a 
man. 
In 
an 
all-round 
bureaucratic 
system 
neither 
the 
bureaucrats 
nor 
their 
subjects 
would 
any 
longer 
be 
real 
human 
beings. 



4. 
THE 
SELECTION 
OF 
THE 
DICTATOR 
All 
champions 
of 
salvation 
through 
the 
rule 
of 
noble 
despots 
blithely 
assume 
that 
there 
cannot 
be 
any 
doubt 
about 
the 
question 
of 
who 
this 
lofty 
ruler 
or 
class 
of 
rulers 
should 
be 
and 
that 
all 
men 
will 
voluntarily 
yield 
to 
the 
supremacy 
of 
this 
superhuman 
dictator 
or 
aristocracy. 
They 
do 
not 
realize 
that 
many 
men 
and 
groups 
of 
men 
could 
claim 
primacy 
for 
themselves. 
If 
the 
decision 
between 
various 
candidates 
is 
not 
left 
to 
majority 
vote, 
no 
principle 
of 
selection 
remains 
other 
than 
civil 
war. 
The 
alternative 
to 
the 
democratic 
principle 
of 
selection 
through 
popular 
election 
is 
the 
seizure 
of 
power 
by 
ruthless 
adventurers. 


In 
the 
second 
century 
after 
Christ 
the 
Roman 
Empire 
was 
ruled 
according 
to 
a 
sublime 
elaboration 
of 
the 
Führer 
principle. 
The 
Emperor 
was 
the 
most 
able 
and 
eminent 
man. 
He 
did 
not 
bequeath 
his 
dignity 
to 
a 
member 
of 
his 
family, 
but 
he 
chose 
as 
successor 
the 
man 
whom 
he 
considered 
best 
fitted 
for 
the 
office. 
This 
system 
gave 
the 
Empire 
a 
succession 
of 
four 
great 
monarchs: 
Trajan, 
Hadrian, 
Antoninus 
Pius, 
and 
Marcus 
Aurelius. 
But 
then 
followed 
the 
era 
of 
the 
Praetorians, 
continuous 
civil 
war, 
anarchy, 
and 
rapid 
decay. 
The 
rule 
of 
the 
worst 
was 
substituted 
for 
the 
rule 
of 
the 
best. 
Ambitious 
generals, 
supported 
by 
mercenaries, 
seized 
power 
and 
ruled 
until 
another 
adventurer 
defeated 
them. 
Treachery, 
rebellion, 
and 
murder 
became 
the 
selective 
principle. 
Historians 
blame 
Marcus 
Aurelius, 
the 
last 
of 
the 
good 
emperors. 
He 
was 
guilty, 
they 
say, 
because 
he 
abandoned 
the 
practice 
of 
his 
predecessors 
and, 
instead 
of 
choosing 
the 
most 
suitable 
man, 
installed 
his 
incompetent 
son 
Commodus. 
However, 
a 
system 
that 
can 
be 
wrecked 
by 
the 
fault 
of 
only 
one 
man 
is 
a 
bad 
system, 
even 
if 
the 
fault 
were 
less 
pardonable 
and 
understandable 
than 
that 
of 
a 
father 
overrating 
the 
character 
and 
capacity 
of 
his 
offspring. 
The 
truth 
is 
that 
such 
a 
Führer 
system 
must 
necessarily 
result 
in 
permanent 
civil 
war 
as 
soon 
as 
there 
are 
several 
candidates 
for 
the 
supreme 
office. 


All 
present-day 
dictators 
came 
into 
office 
through 
violence. 
They 
later 
had 
to 
defend 
their 
supremacy 
against 
the 
aspirations 
of 
rivals. 
Political 
language 
has 
coined 
a 
special 
term 
to 
refer 
to 
such 
actions: 
they 
are 
called 
purges. 
The 



successors 
of 
these 
dictators 
will 
rise 
to 
power 
through 
the 
same 
methods 
and 
will 
apply 
the 
same 
cruelty 
and 
ruthlessness 
in 
maintaining 
it. 
The 
ultimate 
basis 
of 
an 
all-round 
bureaucratic 
system 
is 
violence. 
The 
security 
that 
it 
allegedly 
gives 
is 
the 
turmoil 
of 
endless 
civil 
war. 



5. 
THE 
VANISHING 
OF 
THE 
CRITICAL 
SENSE 
The 
socialists 
assert 
that 
capitalism 
is 
degrading, 
that 
it 
is 
incompatible 
with 
man’s 
dignity, 
that 
it 
weakens 
man’s 
intellectual 
abilities 
and 
spoils 
his 
moral 
integrity. 
Under 
capitalism, 
they 
say, 
everybody 
must 
regard 
his 
fellow 
men 
as 
competitors. 
Man’s 
innate 
instincts 
of 
benevolence 
and 
companionship 
are 
thus 
converted 
into 
hatred 
and 
a 
ruthless 
striving 
for 
personal 
success 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
all 
other 
people. 
But 
socialism 
will 
restore 
the 
virtues 
of 
human 
nature. 
Amicableness, 
fraternity, 
and 
comradeship 
will 
be 
the 
characteristic 
features 
of 
future 
man. 
What 
is 
needed 
first 
is 
to 
eliminate 
this 
worst 
of 
all 
evils, 
competition. 


However, 
competition 
can 
never 
be 
eliminated. 
As 
there 
will 
always 
be 
positions 
which 
men 
value 
more 
highly 
than 
other 
positions, 
people 
will 
strive 
for 
them 
and 
try 
to 
outstrip 
their 
rivals. 
It 
is 
immaterial 
whether 
we 
call 
this 
emulation 
rivalry 
or 
competition. 
At 
any 
rate, 
in 
some 
way 
or 
other 
it 
must 
be 
decided 
whether 
or 
not 
a 
man 
ought 
to 
get 
the 
job 
he 
is 
applying 
for. 
The 
question 
is 
only 
what 
kind 
of 
competition 
should 
exist. 


The 
capitalist 
variety 
of 
competition 
is 
to 
outdo 
other 
people 
on 
the 
market 
through 
offering 
better 
and 
cheaper 
goods. 
The 
bureaucratic 
variety 
consists 
in 
intrigues 
at 
the 
“courts” 
of 
those 
in 
power. 


There 
was 
a 
good 
deal 
of 
flattery, 
adulation, 
servility, 
and 
cringing 
at 
the 
courts 
of 
all 
despotic 
rulers. 
But 
there 
had 
always 
been 
some 
men 
at 
least 
who 
were 
not 
afraid 
to 
tell 
a 
tyrant 
the 
truth. 
It 
is 
different 
in 
our 
day. 
Politicians 
and 
writers 
outdo 
one 
another 
in 
the 
adulation 
of 
the 
sovereign, 
the 
“common 
man.” 
They 
do 
not 
venture 
to 
impair 
their 
popularity 
by 
the 
expression 
of 
unpopular 
ideas. 
The 
courtiers 
of 
Louis 
XIV 
never 
went 
as 
far 
as 
some 
people 
go 
today 
in 
praising 
the 
Führers 
and 
their 
supporters, 
the 
masses. 
It 
seems 
that 
our 
contemporaries 
have 
lost 
all 
common 
sense 
and 
self-criticism. 


At 
a 
Communist 
Party 
Congress 
a 
writer 
named 
Avdyenko 
addressed 
Stalin 



in 
these 
terms: 
“Centuries 
shall 
elapse 
and 
the 
communist 
generations 
of 
the 
future 
will 
deem 
us 
the 
happiest 
of 
all 
mortals 
that 
have 
inhabited 
this 
planet 
throughout 
the 
ages, 
because 
we 
have 
seen 
Stalin 
the 
leader 
genius, 
Stalin 
the 
Sage, 
the 
smiling, 
the 
kindly, 
the 
supremely 
simple. 
When 
I 
met 
Stalin, 
even 
at 
a 
distance, 
I 
throbbed 
with 
his 
forcefulness, 
his 
magnetism, 
and 
his 
greatness. 
I 
wanted 
to 
sing, 
to 
shriek, 
to 
howl 
from 
happiness 
and 
exaltation.”1 
A 
bureaucrat 
addressing 
his 
superior 
on 
whom 
his 
promotion 
depends 
is 
less 
poetic 
but 
no 
less 
crawling. 


When 
at 
the 
Diamond 
Jubilee 
of 
Emperor 
Francis 
Joseph 
a 
statistician 
attributed 
to 
the 
Emperor’s 
credit 
that 
after 
sixty 
years 
of 
his 
reign 
the 
country 
had 
many 
thousands 
of 
miles 
of 
railroads, 
while 
at 
its 
beginning 
there 
were 
much 
fewer, 
the 
public 
(and 
probably 
the 
Emperor 
himself) 
simply 
laughed 
at 
this 
piece 
of 
toadyism. 
But 
nobody 
laughed 
when 
the 
Soviet 
Government 
in 
the 
World’s 
Fairs 
of 
Paris 
and 
New 
York 
flamboyantly 
boasted 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
while 
the 
Russia 
of 
the 
Czars 
used 
no 
tractors 
at 
all, 
a 
quarter 
of 
a 
century 
later 
it 
had 
already 
imitated 
this 
new 
American 
invention. 


Nobody 
ever 
believed 
that 
the 
paternal 
absolutism 
of 
Marie 
Thérese 
and 
her 
grandson 
Francis 
was 
justified 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
Mozart, 
Haydn, 
Beethoven, 
and 
Schubert 
composed 
immortal 
music. 
But 
the 
symphony 
of 
a 
contemporary 
Russian 
composer 
who 
probably 
will 
be 
forgotten 
after 
a 
few 
years 
is 
claimed 
as 
a 
proof 
of 
the 
eminence 
of 
Soviet 
totalitarianism. 


The 
question 
is 
whether 
the 
system 
of 
bureaucratic 
control 
or 
the 
system 
of 
economic 
freedom 
is 
more 
efficient. 
This 
question 
can 
be 
answered 
only 
by 
economic 
reasoning. 
The 
mere 
assertion 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
cigarettes 
manufactured 
by 
the 
French 
Government’s 
tobacco 
monopoly 
were 
not 
so 
bad 
as 
to 
induce 
the 
French 
to 
give 
up 
smoking 
is 
not 
an 
argument 
in 
favor 
of 
government 
operation 
of 
industry. 
Neither 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
cigarettes 
manufactured 
by 
the 
Greek 
Government’s 
monopoly 
were 
the 
delight 
of 
smokers. 
It 
is 
not 
a 
merit 
of 
the 
Greek 
bureaucrats 
that 
the 
climatic 
and 
physical 
conditions 
of 
their 
country 
make 
the 
tobacco 
grown 
by 
the 
peasants 
delicate 
and 
fragrant. 


Every 
German 
took 
it 
for 
granted 
that 
the 
very 
essence 
and 
nature 
of 
things 
make 
it 
imperative 
that 
universities, 
railroads, 
telegraphs, 
and 
telephones 
be 
operated 
by 
the 
government. 
For 
a 
Russian 
the 
idea 
that 
a 
man 
could 
live 



without 
a 
passport, 
duly 
issued 
and 
authenticated 
by 
the 
police, 
always 
seemed 
paradoxical. 
Under 
the 
conditions 
that 
developed 
in 
the 
last 
thirty 
years 
the 
citizens 
of 
continental 
Europe 
became 
mere 
appurtenances 
of 
their 
identification 
papers. 
In 
many 
countries 
it 
was 
risky 
to 
go 
out 
for 
a 
walk 
without 
these 
documents. 
In 
most 
European 
countries 
a 
man 
has 
not 
been 
free 
to 
stay 
overnight 
in 
any 
place 
without 
immediately 
reporting 
to 
the 
local 
police 
department 
his 
sleeping 
place 
and 
every 
change 
of 
address.2 


It 
is 
possible 
that 
some 
good 
may 
be 
derived 
from 
such 
regimentation. 
Of 
course, 
it 
is 
not 
of 
much 
use 
in 
fighting 
crime 
and 
prosecuting 
criminals. 
A 
murderer 
in 
hiding 
will 
not 
shrink 
from 
violating 
the 
law 
requiring 
a 
report 
of 
any 
change 
of 
address.3 
In 
defending 
their 
system 
the 
bureaucrats 
become 
melodramatic. 
They 
ask 
the 
public 
how 
poor 
abandoned 
children 
could 
find 
their 
unscrupulous 
parents 
again. 
They 
do 
not 
mention 
that 
a 
smart 
detective 
might 
be 
able 
to 
find 
them. 
Moreover, 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
are 
some 
scoundrels 
cannot 
be 
considered 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
restricting 
the 
freedom 
of 
the 
immense 
majority 
of 
decent 
people. 


A 
profit-seeking 
enterprise 
is 
supported 
by 
the 
voluntary 
patronage 
of 
the 
public. 
It 
cannot 
subsist 
if 
customers 
do 
not 
pour 
in. 
But 
the 
bureaus 
forcibly 
acquire 
their 
“patrons.” 
That 
an 
office 
is 
approached 
by 
many 
people 
is 
not 
proof 
of 
its 
satisfying 
an 
urgent 
need 
of 
the 
people. 
It 
only 
shows 
that 
it 
interferes 
with 
matters 
that 
are 
important 
to 
the 
life 
of 
everyone. 


The 
fading 
of 
the 
critical 
sense 
is 
a 
serious 
menace 
to 
the 
preservation 
of 
our 
civilization. 
It 
makes 
it 
easy 
for 
quacks 
to 
fool 
the 
people. 
It 
is 
remarkable 
that 
the 
educated 
strata 
are 
more 
gullible 
than 
the 
less 
educated. 
The 
most 
enthusiastic 
supporters 
of 
Marxism, 
Nazism, 
and 
Fascism 
were 
the 
intellectuals, 
not 
the 
boors. 
The 
intellectuals 
were 
never 
keen 
enough 
to 
see 
the 
manifest 
contradictions 
of 
their 
creeds. 
It 
did 
not 
in 
the 
least 
impair 
the 
popularity 
of 
Fascism 
that 
Mussolini 
in 
the 
same 
speech 
praised 
the 
Italians 
as 
the 
representatives 
of 
the 
oldest 
Western 
civilization 
and 
as 
the 
youngest 
among 
the 
civilized 
nations. 
No 
German 
nationalist 
minded 
it 
when 
dark-
haired 
Hitler, 
corpulent 
Goering, 
and 
lame 
Goebbels 
were 
praised 
as 
the 
shining 
representatives 
of 
the 
tall, 
slim, 
fair-haired, 
heroic 
Aryan 
master 
race. 
Is 
it 
not 
amazing 
that 
many 
millions 
of 
non-Russians 
are 
firmly 
convinced 
that 
the 
Soviet 
regime 
is 
democratic, 
even 
more 
democratic 
than 
America? 



This 
absence 
of 
criticism 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
tell 
people 
that 
they 
will 
be 
free 
men 
in 
a 
system 
of 
all-round 
regimentation. 
People 
imagine 
a 
regime 
in 
which 
all 
means 
are 
owned 
by 
the 
state 
and 
the 
government 
is 
the 
sole 
employer 
as 
a 
realm 
of 
freedom. 
They 
never 
take 
into 
account 
the 
possibility 
that 
the 
almighty 
government 
of 
their 
utopia 
could 
aim 
at 
ends 
of 
which 
they 
themselves 
entirely 
disapprove. 
They 
always 
tacitly 
assume 
that 
the 
dictator 
will 
do 
exactly 
what 
they 
themselves 
want 
him 
to 
do.

Thus 
the 
files 
of 
the 
police 
departments 
of 
many 
European 
cities 
provide 
full 
information 
for 
the 
last 
hundred 
or 
even 
hundred 
and 
fifty 
years 
concerning 
every 
resident’s 
or 
visitor’s 
sojourn 
and 
all 
his 
changes 
of 
address. 
A 
priceless 
and 
well-exploited 
source 
of 
knowledge 
indeed 
for 
biographers.

It 
seems 
curious 
to 
Americans 
that 
in 
many 
European 
trials 
the 
jury 
was 
asked 
to 
answer 
two 
questions 
like 
this: 
First, 
is 
the 
defendant 
guilty 
of 
having 
murdered 
the 
victim? 
Secondly, 
is 
the 
defendant 
guilty 
of 
not 
having 
duly 
reported 
his 
change 
of 
address? 
IS 
THERE 
ANY 
REMEDY 
AVAILABLE? 



1. 
PAST 
FAILURES 
WWE 
must 
acknowledge 
the 
fact 
that 
hitherto 
all 
endeavors, 
to 
stop 
the 
further 
advance 
of 
bureaucratization 
and 
socialization 
have 
been 
in 
vain. 
In 
the 
twenty-seven 
years 
that 
have 
passed 
since 
President 
Wilson 
led 
America 
into 
the 
war 
to 
make 
the 
world 
safe 
for 
democracy, 
democracy 
has 
lost 
more 
and 
more 
ground. 
Despotism 
triumphs 
in 
most 
of 
the 
European 
countries. 
Even 
America 
has 
adopted 
policies 
which, 
some 
decades 
ago, 
it 
disparaged 
as 
“Prussian.” 
Mankind 
is 
manifestly 
moving 
toward 
totalitarianism. 
The 
rising 
generation 
yearns 
for 
full 
government 
control 
of 
every 
sphere 
of 
life. 


Learned 
lawyers 
have 
published 
excellent 
treatises 
depicting 
the 
progressive 
substitution 
of 
administrative 
arbitrariness 
for 
the 
rule 
of 
law.1 
They 
have 
told 
the 
story 
of 
how 
the 
undermining 
of 
self-government 
makes 
all 
the 
rights 
of 
the 
individual 
citizen 
disappear 
and 
results 
in 
a 
hyperdespotism 
of 
the 
oriental 
style. 
But 
the 
socialists 
do 
not 
care 
a 
whit 
for 
freedom 
and 
private 
initiative. 


Neither 
have 
satirical 
books 
been 
more 
successful 
than 
the 
ponderous 
tomes 
of 
the 
lawyers. 
Some 
of 
the 
most 
eminent 
writers 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century? 
Balzac, 
Dickens, 
Gogol, 
Maupassant, 
Courteline?have 
struck 
devastating 
blows 
against 
bureaucratism. 
Aldous 
Huxley 
was 
even 
courageous 
enough 
to 
make 
socialism’s 
dreamed 
paradise 
the 
target 
of 
his 
sardonic 
irony. 
The 
public 
was 
delighted. 
But 
his 
readers 
rushed 
nonetheless 
to 
apply 
for 
jobs 
with 
the 
government. 


Some 
people 
like 
to 
make 
fun 
of 
especially 
extravagant 
features 
of 
bureaucracy. 
It 
is 
indeed 
curious 
that 
the 
government 
of 
the 
world’s 
most 
powerful 
and 
richest 
nation 
runs 
an 
office?the 
Bureau 
of 
Home 
Economics 
of 
the 
United 
States 
Department 
of 
Agriculture?one 
of 
the 
tasks 
of 
which 
is 
to 
design 
trousers 
“for 
the 
very 
small 
child 
who 
is 
just 
learning 
to 
dress 
himself.” 
But 
for 
many 
of 
our 
contemporaries 
there 
is 
nothing 
ridiculous 
in 
this. 
They 
aim 
at 
a 
mode 
of 
government 
under 
which 
the 
production 
of 
hose, 
underwear, 
and 
all 
other 
useful 
things 
should 
be 
a 
task 
of 
the 
authorities. 



All 
learned 
criticisms 
and 
witty 
satires 
are 
of 
no 
avail 
because 
they 
do 
not 
hit 
the 
core 
of 
the 
problem. 
Bureaucratization 
is 
only 
a 
particular 
feature 
of 
socialization. 
The 
main 
matter 
is: 
Capitalism 
or 
Socialism? 
Which? 


The 
supporters 
of 
socialism 
contend 
that 
capitalism 
is 
an 
unfair 
system 
of 
exploitation, 
that 
it 
is 
extremely 
detrimental 
to 
the 
welfare 
of 
the 
masses 
and 
that 
it 
results 
in 
misery, 
degradation, 
and 
progressive 
pauperization 
of 
the 
immense 
majority. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
they 
depict 
their 
socialist 
utopia 
as 
a 
promised 
land 
of 
milk 
and 
honey 
in 
which 
everybody 
will 
be 
happy 
and 
rich. 
Are 
they 
right 
or 
are 
they 
wrong? 
This 
is 
the 
question. 



2. 
ECONOMICS 
VERSUS 
PLANNING 
AND 
TOTALITARIANISM 
This 
is 
entirely 
an 
economic 
problem. 
It 
cannot 
be 
decided 
without 
entering 
into 
a 
full 
scrutiny 
of 
economics. 
The 
spurious 
catchwords 
and 
fallacious 
doctrines 
of 
the 
advocates 
of 
government 
control, 
socialism, 
communism, 
planning, 
and 
totalitarianism 
cannot 
be 
unmasked 
except 
by 
economic 
reasoning. 
Whether 
one 
likes 
it 
or 
not, 
it 
is 
a 
fact 
that 
the 
main 
issues 
of 
present-day 
politics 
are 
purely 
economic 
and 
cannot 
be 
understood 
without 
a 
grasp 
of 
economic 
theory. 
Only 
a 
man 
conversant 
with 
the 
main 
problems 
of 
economics 
is 
in 
a 
position 
to 
form 
an 
independent 
opinion 
on 
the 
problems 
involved. 
All 
the 
others 
are 
merely 
repeating 
what 
they 
have 
picked 
up 
by 
the 
way. 
They 
are 
an 
easy 
prey 
to 
demagogic 
swindlers 
and 
idiotic 
quacks. 
Their 
gullibility 
is 
the 
most 
serious 
menace 
to 
the 
preservation 
of 
democracy 
and 
to 
Western 
civilization. 


The 
first 
duty 
of 
a 
citizen 
of 
a 
democratic 
community 
is 
to 
educate 
himself 
and 
to 
acquire 
the 
knowledge 
needed 
for 
dealing 
with 
civic 
affairs. 
The 
franchise 
is 
not 
a 
privilege 
but 
a 
duty 
and 
a 
moral 
responsibility. 
The 
voter 
is 
virtually 
an 
officeholder; 
his 
office 
is 
the 
supreme 
one 
and 
implies 
the 
highest 
obligation. 
A 
citizen 
fully 
absorbed 
by 
his 
scientific 
work 
in 
other 
fields 
or 
by 
his 
calling 
as 
an 
artist 
may 
plead 
extenuating 
circumstances 
when 
failing 
in 
this 
task 
of 
self-instruction. 
Perhaps 
such 
men 
are 
right 
in 
pretending 
that 
they 
have 
more 
important 
tasks 
to 
fulfill. 
But 
all 
the 
other 
intelligent 
men 
are 
not 
only 
frivolous 
but 
mischievous 
in 
neglecting 
to 
educate 
and 
instruct 
themselves 
for 
the 
best 
performance 
of 
their 
duties 
as 
sovereign 
voters. 


The 
main 
propaganda 
trick 
of 
the 
supporters 
of 
the 
allegedly 
“progressive” 
policy 
of 
government 
control 
is 
to 
blame 
capitalism 
for 
all 
that 
is 
unsatisfactory 
in 
present-day 
conditions 
and 
to 
extol 
the 
blessings 
which 
socialism 
has 
in 
store 
for 
mankind. 
They 
have 
never 
attempted 
to 
prove 
their 
fallacious 
dogmas 
or 
still 
less 
to 
refute 
the 
objections 
raised 
by 
the 
economists. 
All 
they 
did 
was 
to 
call 
their 
adversaries 
names 
and 
to 
cast 
suspicion 
upon 
their 
motives. 
And, 
unfortunately, 
the 
average 
citizen 
cannot 



see 
through 
these 
stratagems. 


Consider, 
for 
instance, 
the 
problem 
of 
mass 
unemployment 
prolonged 
year 
after 
year. 
The 
“progressive” 
interprets 
it 
as 
an 
evil 
inherent 
in 
capitalism. 
The 
naive 
public 
is 
ready 
to 
swallow 
this 
explanation. 
People 
do 
not 
realize 
that 
in 
an 
unhampered 
labor 
market, 
manipulated 
neither 
by 
labor-union 
pressure 
nor 
by 
government-fixed 
minimum 
wage 
rates, 
unemployment 
affects 
only 
small 
groups 
for 
a 
short 
time. 
Under 
free 
capitalism 
unemployment 
is 
a 
comparatively 
unimportant 
temporary 
phenomenon; 
there 
prevails 
a 
permanent 
tendency 
for 
unemployment 
to 
disappear. 
Economic 
changes 
may 
bring 
about 
new 
unemployment. 
But 
at 
the 
wage 
rates 
established 
in 
a 
free 
labor 
market 
everyone 
eager 
to 
earn 
wages 
finally 
gets 
a 
job. 
Unemployment 
as 
a 
mass 
phenomenon 
is 
the 
outcome 
of 
allegedly 
“prolabor” 
policies 
of 
the 
governments 
and 
of 
labor-union 
pressure 
and 
compulsion. 


This 
explanation 
is 
by 
no 
means 
peculiar 
to 
those 
economists 
whom 
the 
“progressives” 
call 
“reactionaries.” 
Karl 
Marx 
himself 
was 
fully 
convinced 
that 
labor 
unions 
cannot 
succeed 
in 
raising 
wage 
rates 
for 
all 
workers. 
The 
Marxian 
doctrinaires 
for 
many 
years 
firmly 
opposed 
all 
endeavors 
to 
fix 
minimum 
wage 
rates. 
They 
deemed 
such 
measures 
contrary 
to 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
great 
majority 
of 
wage 
earners. 


It 
is 
an 
illusion 
to 
believe 
that 
government 
spending 
can 
create 
jobs 
for 
the 
unemployed, 
that 
is, 
for 
those 
who 
cannot 
get 
jobs 
on 
account 
of 
the 
labor 
unions’ 
or 
the 
government’s 
policies. 
If 
the 
government’s 
spending 
is 
financed 
by 
noninflationary 
methods, 
that 
is, 
either 
by 
taxing 
the 
citizens 
or 
by 
borrowing 
from 
the 
public, 
it 
abolishes 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
as 
many 
jobs 
as 
it 
creates 
on 
the 
other. 
If 
it 
is 
financed 
by 
inflation, 
that 
is, 
either 
by 
an 
increase 
of 
money 
and 
bank 
notes 
in 
circulation 
or 
by 
borrowing 
from 
the 
commercial 
banks, 
it 
reduces 
unemployment 
only 
if 
money 
wages 
lag 
behind 
the 
rise 
of 
commodity 
prices, 
that 
is, 
if 
and 
so 
far 
as 
real 
wage 
rates 
drop. 
There 
is 
but 
one 
way 
toward 
an 
increase 
of 
real 
wage 
rates 
for 
all 
those 
eager 
to 
earn 
wages: 
the 
progressive 
accumulation 
of 
new 
capital 
and 
the 
improvement 
of 
technical 
methods 
of 
production 
which 
the 
new 
capital 
brings 
about. 
The 
true 
interests 
of 
labor 
coincide 
with 
those 
of 
business. 


The 
approach 
to 
a 
grasp 
of 
economic 
problems 
does 
not 
consist 
in 
an 



indiscriminate 
assimilation 
of 
more 
or 
less 
disconnected 
facts 
and 
figures. 
It 
consists 
rather 
in 
a 
careful 
analysis 
and 
examination 
of 
conditions 
by 
reasonable 
reflection. 
What 
is 
needed 
above 
all 
is 
common 
sense 
and 
logical 
clarity. 
Go 
right 
to 
the 
bottom 
of 
things 
is 
the 
main 
rule. 
Do 
not 
acquiesce 
in 
superficial 
explanations 
and 
solutions. 
Use 
your 
power 
of 
thinking 
and 
your 
critical 
abilities. 


It 
would 
be 
a 
serious 
blunder 
to 
believe 
that 
this 
recommendation 
of 
economic 
studies 
aims 
at 
a 
substitution 
of 
another 
brand 
of 
propaganda 
for 
the 
propaganda 
of 
the 
various 
governments 
and 
parties. 
Propaganda 
is 
one 
of 
the 
worst 
evils 
of 
bureaucracy 
and 
socialism. 
Propaganda 
is 
always 
the 
propaganda 
of 
lies, 
fallacies, 
and 
superstitions. 
Truth 
does 
not 
need 
any 
propaganda; 
it 
holds 
its 
own. 
The 
characteristic 
mark 
of 
truth 
is 
that 
it 
is 
the 
correct 
representation 
of 
reality, 
i.e., 
of 
a 
state 
of 
affairs 
that 
is 
and 
works 
whether 
or 
not 
anybody 
recognizes 
it. 
The 
recognition 
and 
pronouncement 
of 
truth 
is 
as 
such 
a 
condemnation 
of 
everything 
that 
is 
untrue. 
It 
carries 
on 
by 
the 
mere 
fact 
of 
being 
true. 


Therefore 
let 
the 
false 
prophets 
go 
on. 
Do 
not 
try 
to 
imitate 
their 
policies. 
Do 
not 
try 
as 
they 
do 
to 
silence 
and 
to 
outlaw 
dissenters. 
The 
liars 
must 
be 
afraid 
of 
truth 
and 
are 
therefore 
driven 
to 
suppress 
its 
pronouncement. 
But 
the 
advocates 
of 
truth 
put 
their 
hopes 
upon 
their 
own 
rightness. 
Veracity 
does 
not 
fear 
the 
liars. 
It 
can 
stand 
their 
competition. 
The 
propagandists 
may 
continue 
to 
spread 
their 
fables 
and 
to 
indoctrinate 
youth. 
They 
will 
fail 
lamentably. 


Lenin 
and 
Hitler 
knew 
very 
well 
why 
they 
abolished 
freedom 
of 
thought, 
speech, 
and 
the 
press, 
and 
why 
they 
closed 
the 
frontiers 
of 
their 
countries 
to 
any 
import 
of 
ideas 
from 
abroad. 
Their 
systems 
could 
not 
survive 
without 
concentration 
camps, 
censors, 
and 
hangmen. 
Their 
main 
instruments 
are 
the 


G.P.U. 
and 
the 
Gestapo. 
The 
British 
champions 
of 
socialization 
and 
bureaucratization 
are 
no 
less 
fully 
aware 
than 
the 
Bolsheviks 
and 
the 
Nazis 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
under 
freedom 
of 
speech 
and 
thought 
they 
will 
never 
achieve 
their 
ends. 
Professor 
Harold 
Laski 
is 
frank 
enough 
to 
declare 
that 
a 
restriction 
of 
Parliament’s 
powers 
is 
necessary 
to 
safeguard 
the 
transition 
to 
socialism.2 
Sir 
Stafford 
Cripps, 
the 
favorite 
candidate 
of 
the 
self-styled 
liberals 
for 
Prime 
Minister, 
has 
advised 
a 
“Planning 
and 
Enabling 
Act” 
which, 
once 
passed 
by 
Parliament, 
could 
not 
be 



discussed, 
still 
less 
repealed 
again. 
By 
virtue 
of 
this 
act, 
which 
should 
be 
very 
general 
and 
leave 
all 
“details” 
to 
the 
Cabinet, 
the 
Government 
would 
be 
endowed 
with 
irrevocable 
powers. 
Its 
orders 
and 
decrees 
should 
never 
be 
considered 
by 
Parliament; 
neither 
should 
there 
be 
a 
recourse 
to 
the 
Courts 
of 
Justice. 
All 
offices 
should 
be 
manned 
by 
“staunch 
party 
members,” 
by 
“persons 
of 
known 
Socialist 
views.”3 
The 
British 
“Council 
of 
Clergy 
and 
Ministers 
for 
Common 
Ownership” 
declares 
in 
a 
pamphlet 
to 
which 
the 
Bishop 
of 
Bradford 
wrote 
the 
foreword 
that 
the 
establishment 
of 
real 
and 
permanent 
socialism 
requires 
“that 
all 
the 
fundamental 
opposition 
must 
be 
liquidated, 
i.e., 
rendered 
politically 
inactive 
by 
disfranchisement, 
and, 
if 
necessary, 
by 
imprisonment.”4 
Professor 
Joan 
Robinson 
of 
Cambridge 
University, 
second 
only 
to 
Lord 
Keynes 
himself 
in 
the 
leadership 
of 
the 
Keynesian 
school, 
is 
no 
less 
intolerant 
in 
her 
zeal 
to 
realize 
socialism. 
In 
her 
opinion 
“the 
notion 
of 
freedom 
is 
a 
slippery 
one.” 
It 
is 
“only 
when 
there 
is 
no 
serious 
enemy, 
without 
or 
within, 
that 
full 
freedom 
of 
speech 
can 
be 
safely 
allowed.” 
Mrs. 
Robinson 
is 
not 
only 
afraid 
of 
independent 
churches, 
universities, 
learned 
societies, 
and 
publishing 
houses, 
but 
no 
less 
of 
independent 
theaters 
and 
philharmonic 
societies. 
All 
such 
institutions, 
she 
contends, 
should 
be 
allowed 
to 
exist 
only 
“provided 
the 
regime 
is 
sufficiently 
secure 
to 
risk 
criticism.”5 
And 
another 
distinguished 
advocate 
of 
British 
collectivism, 
J. 
G. 
Crowther, 
does 
not 
shrink 
from 
praising 
the 
blessings 
of 
inquisition.6 
What 
a 
pity 
the 
Stuarts 
did 
not 
live 
to 
witness 
the 
triumph 
of 
their 
principles! 


Thus 
the 
most 
eminent 
advocates 
of 
socialism 
implicitly 
admit 
that 
their 
tenets 
and 
plans 
cannot 
stand 
the 
criticism 
of 
economic 
science 
and 
are 
doomed 
under 
a 
regime 
of 
freedom. 


But 
as 
happily 
there 
are 
still 
some 
free 
countries 
left 
there 
is 
still 
some 
hope 
for 
a 
resurrection 
of 
truth. 


3. 
THE 
PLAIN 
CITIZEN 
VERSUS 
THE 
PROFESSIONAL 
PROPAGANDIST 
OF 
BUREAUCRATIZATION 
The 
aim 
of 
the 
popularization 
of 
economic 
studies 
is 
not 
to 
make 
every 
man 
an 
economist. 
The 
idea 
is 
to 
equip 
the 
citizen 
for 
his 
civic 
functions 
in 
community 
life. 



The 
conflict 
between 
capitalism 
and 
totalitarianism, 
on 
the 
outcome 
of 
which 
the 
fate 
of 
civilization 
depends, 
will 
not 
be 
decided 
by 
civil 
wars 
and 
revolutions. 
It 
is 
a 
war 
of 
ideas. 
Public 
opinion 
will 
determine 
victory 
and 
defeat. 


Wherever 
and 
whenever 
men 
meet 
for 
discussing 
any 
affairs 
of 
their 
municipality, 
state, 
or 
nation, 
public 
opinion 
is 
in 
the 
process 
of 
evolving 
and 
changing, 
however 
trifling 
the 
immediate 
topic 
concerned 
may 
be. 
Public 
opinion 
is 
influenced 
by 
anything 
that 
is 
spoken 
or 
done 
in 
transactions 
between 
buyers 
and 
sellers, 
between 
employers 
and 
employees, 
between 
creditors 
and 
debtors. 
Public 
opinion 
is 
shaped 
in 
the 
debates 
of 
countless 
representative 
bodies, 
committees 
and 
commissions, 
associations 
and 
clubs, 
by 
editorials 
and 
letters 
to 
the 
editor, 
by 
the 
pleading 
of 
lawyers 
and 
by 
the 
opinions 
of 
judges. 


In 
all 
these 
discussions 
the 
professionals 
have 
an 
advantage 
over 
the 
laymen. 
The 
odds 
are 
always 
in 
favor 
of 
those 
who 
devote 
all 
their 
effort 
exclusively 
to 
one 
thing 
only. 
Although 
not 
necessarily 
experts 
and 
often 
certainly 
not 
more 
clever 
than 
the 
amateurs, 
they 
enjoy 
the 
benefit 
of 
being 
specialists. 
Their 
eristic 
technique 
as 
well 
as 
their 
training 
are 
superior. 
They 
come 
to 
the 
encounter 
with 
rested 
mind 
and 
body, 
not 
tired 
after 
a 
long 
day’s 
work 
like 
the 
amateurs. 


Now, 
almost 
all 
these 
professionals 
are 
zealous 
advocates 
of 
bureaucratism 
and 
socialism. 
There 
are, 
first 
of 
all, 
the 
hosts 
of 
employees 
of 
the 
governments’ 
and 
the 
various 
parties’ 
propaganda 
offices. 
There 
are 
furthermore 
the 
teachers 
of 
various 
educational 
institutions 
which 
curiously 
enough 
consider 
the 
avowal 
of 
bureaucratic, 
socialist, 
or 
Marxian 
radicalism 
the 
mark 
of 
scientific 
perfection. 
There 
are 
the 
editors 
and 
contributors 
of 
“progressive” 
newspapers 
and 
magazines, 
labor-union 
leaders 
and 
organizers, 
and 
finally 
leisured 
ambitious 
men 
anxious 
to 
get 
into 
the 
headlines 
by 
the 
expression 
of 
radical 
views. 
The 
ordinary 
businessman, 
lawyer, 
or 
wage 
earner 
is 
no 
match 
for 
them. 


The 
layman 
may 
brilliantly 
succeed 
in 
proving 
his 
argument. 
It 
is 
of 
no 
use. 
For 
his 
adversary, 
clothed 
with 
the 
full 
dignity 
of 
his 
office 
or 
his 
professorship, 
shouts 
back: 
“The 
fallacy 
of 
the 
gentleman’s 
reasoning 
has 
long 
since 
been 
unmasked 
by 
the 
famous 
German 
professors, 
Mayer, 
Müller, 



and 
Schmid. 
Only 
an 
idiot 
can 
still 
cling 
to 
such 
antiquated 
and 
done-for 
ideas.” 
The 
layman 
is 
discredited 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
audience, 
fully 
trusting 
in 
professional 
infallibility. 
He 
does 
not 
know 
how 
to 
answer. 
He 
has 
never 
heard 
the 
names 
of 
these 
eminent 
German 
professors. 
Thus 
he 
does 
not 
know 
that 
their 
books 
are 
simple 
humbug, 
full 
of 
nonsense, 
and 
that 
they 
did 
not 
touch 
the 
problems 
which 
he 
raised. 
He 
may 
learn 
it 
later. 
But 
that 
cannot 
alter 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
has 
been 
defeated 
on 
the 
spot. 


Or 
the 
layman 
may 
cleverly 
demonstrate 
the 
impracticability 
of 
some 
project 
suggested. 
Then 
the 
professional 
retorts: 
“This 
gentleman 
is 
so 
ignorant 
as 
not 
to 
know 
that 
the 
scheme 
proposed 
succeeded 
very 
well 
in 
socialist 
Sweden 
and 
in 
red 
Vienna.” 
Again 
our 
layman 
is 
silenced. 
How 
can 
he 
know 
that 
almost 
all 
English-language 
books 
on 
Sweden 
and 
Vienna 
are 
propaganda 
products 
badly 
distorting 
the 
facts? 
He 
has 
not 
had 
the 
opportunity 
of 
getting 
correct 
information 
from 
the 
original 
sources. 


The 
climax 
of 
the 
professional’s 
oratory 
is, 
of 
course, 
always 
the 
reference 
to 
Russia, 
the 
paradise 
of 
the 
workers 
and 
peasants. 
For 
almost 
thirty 
years 
only 
fanatical 
communists 
and 
fellow 
travelers 
were 
permitted 
to 
enter 
Russia. 
Their 
reports 
are 
uncritical 
glorifications 
of 
the 
Soviets, 
some 
of 
them 
utterly 
dishonest, 
the 
rest 
childish 
in 
their 
naive 
credulity. 
It 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
comforting 
facts 
that 
some 
of 
these 
travelers 
abandoned 
in 
Russia 
their 
pro-
Soviet 
leanings 
and, 
back 
home, 
published 
unvarnished 
accounts. 
But 
the 
professionals 
easily 
dispose 
of 
these 
books 
by 
calling 
their 
authors 
“Fascists.” 


What 
is 
needed 
is 
to 
make 
the 
civic 
leaders 
fit 
for 
such 
encounters 
with 
professional 
preachers 
of 
bureaucratization 
and 
socialization. 
It 
is 
hopeless 
to 
stop 
the 
trend 
toward 
bureaucratization 
by 
the 
mere 
expression 
of 
indignation 
and 
by 
a 
nostalgic 
glorification 
of 
the 
good 
old 
times. 
These 
old 
days 
were 
not 
so 
good 
as 
they 
appear 
to 
some 
of 
our 
contemporaries. 
What 
was 
great 
in 
them 
was 
their 
reliance 
on 
the 
tendency 
toward 
improvement 
inherent 
in 
the 
system 
of 
unhampered 
market 
economy. 
They 
did 
not 
believe 
in 
the 
government’s 
godlikeness. 
This 
was 
their 
glory. 


The 
most 
detrimental 
outcome 
of 
the 
average 
citizen’s 
repugnance 
to 
a 
serious 
concern 
with 
economic 
problems 
is 
his 
readiness 
to 
back 
a 
program 
of 
compromise. 
He 
looks 
upon 
the 
conflict 
between 
capitalism 
and 
socialism 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
quarrel 
between 
two 
groups?labor 
and 
capital?each 
of 
which 



claims 
for 
itself 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
matter 
at 
issue. 
As 
he 
himself 
is 
not 
prepared 
to 
appraise 
the 
merits 
of 
the 
arguments 
advanced 
by 
each 
of 
the 
parties, 
he 
thinks 
it 
would 
be 
a 
fair 
solution 
to 
end 
the 
dispute 
by 
an 
amicable 
arrangement: 
each 
claimant 
should 
have 
a 
part 
of 
his 
claim. 
Thus 
the 
program 
of 
government 
interference 
with 
business 
acquired 
its 
prestige. 
There 
should 
be 
neither 
full 
capitalism 
nor 
full 
socialism, 
but 
something 
in 
between, 
a 
middle 
way. 
This 
third 
system, 
assert 
its 
supporters, 
should 
be 
capitalism 
regulated 
and 
regimented 
by 
government 
interference 
with 
business. 
But 
this 
government 
intervention 
should 
not 
amount 
to 
full 
government 
control 
of 
all 
economic 
activities; 
it 
should 
be 
limited 
to 
the 
elimination 
of 
some 
especially 
objectionable 
excrescences 
of 
capitalism 
without 
suppressing 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
entrepreneur 
altogether. 
Thus 
a 
social 
order 
will 
result 
which 
is 
allegedly 
as 
far 
from 
full 
capitalism 
as 
it 
is 
from 
pure 
socialism, 
and 
while 
retaining 
the 
advantages 
inherent 
in 
each 
of 
these 
two 
systems 
will 
avoid 
their 
disadvantages. 
Almost 
all 
those 
who 
do 
not 
unconditionally 
advocate 
full 
socialism 
support 
this 
system 
of 
interventionism 
today 
and 
all 
governments 
which 
are 
not 
outright 
and 
frankly 
pro-socialist 
have 
espoused 
a 
policy 
of 
economic 
interventionism. 
There 
are 
nowadays 
very 
few 
who 
oppose 
any 
kind 
of 
government 
interference 
with 
prices, 
wage 
rates, 
interest 
rates, 
and 
profits 
and 
are 
not 
afraid 
to 
contend 
that 
they 
consider 
capitalism 
and 
free 
enterprise 
the 
only 
workable 
system, 
beneficial 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
society 
and 
to 
all 
its 
members. 


Yet, 
the 
reasoning 
of 
the 
advocates 
of 
this 
middle 
solution 
is 
entirely 
fallacious. 
The 
conflict 
between 
socialism 
and 
capitalism 
is 
not 
a 
struggle 
between 
two 
parties 
for 
a 
greater 
share 
in 
the 
social 
dividend. 
To 
see 
the 
matter 
this 
way 
is 
tantamount 
to 
a 
full 
acceptance 
of 
the 
tenets 
of 
the 
Marxians 
and 
the 
other 
socialists. 
The 
adversaries 
of 
socialism 
deny 
that 
any 
class 
or 
group 
would 
fare 
better 
under 
socialism 
than 
under 
outright 
capitalism. 
They 
contest 
the 
thesis 
that 
the 
workers 
would 
be 
better 
off 
in 
a 
socialist 
commonwealth 
and 
are, 
consequently, 
wronged 
by 
the 
very 
existence 
of 
the 
capitalist 
system. 
They 
do 
not 
recommend 
capitalism 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
selfish 
interests 
of 
the 
entrepreneurs 
and 
capitalists 
but 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
all 
members 
of 
society. 
The 
great 
historical 
conflict 
concerning 
the 
problem 
of 
society’s 
economic 
organization 
cannot 
be 
dealt 
with 
like 
a 
quarrel 
between 
two 
businessmen 
concerning 
an 
amount 
of 
money; 
it 
cannot 
be 
solved 
by 
splitting 
the 
difference. 



Economic 
interventionism 
is 
a 
self-defeating 
policy. 
The 
individual 
measures 
that 
it 
applies 
do 
not 
achieve 
the 
results 
sought. 
They 
bring 
about 
a 
state 
of 
affairs, 
which?from 
the 
viewpoint 
of 
its 
advocates 
themselves?is 
much 
more 
undesirable 
than 
the 
previous 
state 
they 
intended 
to 
alter. 
Unemployment 
of 
a 
great 
part 
of 
those 
ready 
to 
earn 
wages, 
prolonged 
year 
after 
year, 
monopoly, 
economic 
crisis, 
general 
restriction 
of 
the 
productivity 
of 
economic 
effort, 
economic 
nationalism, 
and 
war 
are 
the 
inescapable 
consequences 
of 
government 
interference 
with 
business 
as 
recommended 
by 
the 
supporters 
of 
the 
third 
solution. 
All 
those 
evils 
for 
which 
the 
socialists 
blame 
capitalism 
are 
precisely 
the 
product 
of 
this 
unfortunate, 
allegedly 
“progressive” 
policy. 
The 
catastrophic 
events 
which 
are 
grist 
for 
the 
mills 
of 
the 
radical 
socialists 
are 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
ideas 
of 
those 
who 
say: 
“I 
am 
not 
against 
capitalism, 
but 
…” 
Such 
people 
are 
virtually 
nothing 
but 
pacemakers 
of 
socialization 
and 
thorough 
bureaucratization. 
Their 
ignorance 
begets 
disaster. 


Division 
of 
labor 
and 
specialization 
are 
essential 
features 
of 
civilization. 
But 
for 
them 
both 
material 
prosperity 
and 
intellectual 
progress 
would 
be 
impossible. 
The 
existence 
of 
an 
integrated 
group 
of 
scientists, 
scholars, 
and 
research 
workers 
is 
an 
outcome 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
just 
as 
is 
the 
existence 
of 
any 
other 
class 
of 
specialists. 
The 
man 
who 
specializes 
in 
economics 
is 
a 
specialist 
like 
all 
other 
specialists. 
The 
further 
advancement 
of 
economic 
science 
will 
in 
the 
future 
also 
be 
an 
achievement 
of 
men 
devoting 
all 
their 
endeavors 
to 
this 
task. 


But 
it 
would 
be 
a 
fateful 
error 
for 
the 
citizens 
to 
leave 
concern 
with 
economic 
studies 
to 
the 
professionals 
as 
their 
exclusive 
domain. 
As 
the 
main 
issues 
of 
present-day 
politics 
are 
essentially 
economic, 
such 
a 
resignation 
would 
amount 
to 
a 
complete 
abdication 
of 
the 
citizens 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
professionals. 
If 
the 
voters 
or 
the 
members 
of 
a 
parliament 
are 
faced 
with 
the 
problems 
raised 
by 
a 
bill 
concerning 
the 
prevention 
of 
cattle 
diseases 
or 
the 
construction 
of 
an 
office 
building, 
they 
may 
leave 
the 
discussion 
of 
the 
details 
to 
the 
experts. 
Such 
veterinarian 
and 
engineering 
problems 
do 
not 
interfere 
with 
the 
fundamentals 
of 
social 
and 
political 
life. 
They 
are 
important 
but 
not 
primary 
and 
vital. 
But 
if 
not 
only 
the 
masses 
but 
even 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
their 
elected 
representatives 
declare: 
“These 
monetary 
problems 
can 
only 
be 
comprehended 
by 
specialists; 
we 
do 
not 
have 
the 
inclination 
to 
study 
them; 
in 
this 
matter 
we 
must 
trust 
the 
experts,” 
they 
are 
virtually 
renouncing 



their 
sovereignty 
to 
the 
professionals. 
It 
does 
not 
matter 
whether 
or 
not 
they 
formally 
delegate 
their 
powers 
to 
legislate 
or 
not. 
At 
any 
rate 
the 
specialists 
outstrip 
them. 
The 
bureaucrats 
carry 
on. 


The 
plain 
citizens 
are 
mistaken 
in 
complaining 
that 
the 
bureaucrats 
have 
arrogated 
powers; 
they 
themselves 
and 
their 
mandatories 
have 
abandoned 
their 
sovereignty. 
Their 
ignorance 
of 
fundamental 
problems 
of 
economics 
has 
made 
the 
professional 
specialists 
supreme. 
All 
technical 
and 
juridical 
details 
of 
legislation 
can 
and 
must 
be 
left 
to 
the 
experts. 
But 
democracy 
becomes 
impracticable 
if 
the 
eminent 
citizens, 
the 
intellectual 
leaders 
of 
the 
community, 
are 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
form 
their 
own 
opinion 
on 
the 
basic 
social, 
economic, 
and 
political 
principles 
of 
policies. 
If 
the 
citizens 
are 
under 
the 
intellectual 
hegemony 
of 
the 
bureaucratic 
professionals, 
society 
breaks 
up 
into 
two 
castes: 
the 
ruling 
professionals, 
the 
Brahmins, 
and 
the 
gullible 
citizenry. 
Then 
despotism 
emerges, 
whatever 
the 
wording 
of 
constitutions 
and 
laws 
may 
be. 


Democracy 
means 
self-determination. 
How 
can 
people 
determine 
their 
own 
affairs 
if 
they 
are 
too 
indifferent 
to 
gain 
through 
their 
own 
thinking 
an 
independent 
judgment 
on 
fundamental 
political 
and 
economic 
problems? 
Democracy 
is 
not 
a 
good 
that 
people 
can 
enjoy 
without 
trouble. 
It 
is, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
a 
treasure 
that 
must 
be 
daily 
defended 
and 
conquered 
anew 
by 
strenuous 
effort.

(New

noteworthy 
that 
the 
latter 
book 
was 
published 
before

of

CONCLUSION 


THE 
analysis 
of 
the 
technical 
characteristics 
of 
bureaucratic 
management 
and 
of 
its 
opposite, 
profit 
management, 
provides 
a 
clue 
for 
a 
fair 
and 
unbiased 
valuation 
of 
both 
systems 
of 
doing 
things 
under 
the 
division 
of 
labor. 


Public 
administration, 
the 
handling 
of 
the 
government 
apparatus 
of 
coercion 
and 
compulsion, 
must 
necessarily 
be 
formalistic 
and 
bureaucratic. 
No 
reform 
can 
remove 
the 
bureaucratic 
features 
of 
the 
government’s 
bureaus. 
It 
is 
useless 
to 
blame 
them 
for 
their 
slowness 
and 
slackness. 
It 
is 
vain 
to 
lament 
over 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
assiduity, 
carefulness, 
and 
painstaking 
work 
of 
the 
average 
bureau 
clerk 
are, 
as 
a 
rule, 
below 
those 
of 
the 
average 
worker 
in 
private 
business. 
(There 
are, 
after 
all, 
many 
civil 
servants 
whose 
enthusiastic 
fervor 
amounts 
to 
unselfish 
sacrifice.) 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
an 
unquestionable 
yardstick 
of 
success 
and 
failure 
it 
is 
almost 
impossible 
for 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
men 
to 
find 
that 
incentive 
to 
utmost 
exertion 
that 
the 
money 
calculus 
of 
profit-seeking 
business 
easily 
provides. 
It 
is 
of 
no 
use 
to 
criticize 
the 
bureaucrat’s 
pedantic 
observance 
of 
rigid 
rules 
and 
regulations. 
Such 
rules 



are 
indispensable 
if 
public 
administration 
is 
not 
to 
slip 
out 
of 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
top 
executives 
and 
degenerate 
into 
the 
supremacy 
of 
subordinate 
clerks. 
These 
rules 
are, 
moreover, 
the 
only 
means 
of 
making 
the 
law 
supreme 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
public 
affairs 
and 
of 
protecting 
the 
citizen 
against 
despotic 
arbitrariness. 


It 
is 
easy 
for 
an 
observer 
to 
indict 
the 
bureaucratic 
apparatus 
for 
extravagance. 
But 
the 
executive 
with 
whom 
the 
responsibility 
for 
perfect 
service 
rests 
sees 
the 
matter 
from 
another 
angle. 
He 
does 
not 
want 
to 
run 
too 
high 
a 
risk. 
He 
prefers 
to 
be 
on 
the 
safe 
side 
and 
to 
be 
doubly 
sure. 


All 
such 
deficiencies 
are 
inherent 
in 
the 
performance 
of 
services 
which 
cannot 
be 
checked 
by 
money 
statements 
of 
profit 
and 
loss. 
Indeed 
we 
would 
never 
have 
recognized 
that 
they 
really 
are 
deficiencies 
if 
we 
were 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
compare 
the 
bureaucratic 
system 
with 
the 
operation 
of 
profit-
seeking 
enterprise. 
This 
much-abused 
system 
of 
the 
“mean” 
striving 
for 
profit 
made 
people 
efficiency 
conscious 
and 
eager 
for 
the 
utmost 
rationalization. 
But 
we 
cannot 
help 
it. 
We 
must 
put 
up 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
one 
cannot 
apply 
to 
a 
police 
department 
or 
to 
the 
office 
of 
a 
tax 
collector 
the 
well-tried 
methods 
of 
profit-seeking 
business. 


Yet 
the 
whole 
matter 
takes 
on 
a 
quite 
different 
meaning 
in 
view 
of 
the 
fanatical 
endeavors 
to 
transform 
the 
entire 
apparatus 
of 
production 
and 
distribution 
into 
a 
mammoth 
bureau. 
Lenin’s 
ideal 
of 
taking 
the 
organization 
of 
the 
government’s 
postal 
service 
as 
the 
pattern 
of 
society’s 
economic 
organization 
and 
of 
making 
every 
man 
a 
cog 
in 
a 
vast 
bureaucratic 
machine1 
makes 
it 
imperative 
to 
unmask 
the 
inferiority 
of 
bureaucratic 
methods 
when 
compared 
with 
those 
of 
private 
business. 
The 
aim 
of 
such 
a 
scrutiny 
is 
certainly 
not 
to 
disparage 
the 
work 
of 
tax 
collectors, 
customs 
officers, 
and 
patrolmen 
or 
to 
belittle 
their 
achievements. 
But 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
show 
in 
what 
essential 
respects 
a 
steel 
plant 
differs 
from 
an 
embassy 
and 
a 
shoe 
plant 
from 
a 
marriage 
license 
bureau, 
and 
why 
it 
would 
be 
mischievous 
to 
reorganize 
a 
bakery 
according 
to 
the 
pattern 
of 
the 
post 
office. 


What 
is 
called 
in 
a 
very 
biased 
terminology 
the 
substitution 
of 
the 
service 
principle 
for 
the 
profit 
principle 
would 
result 
in 
an 
abandonment 
of 
the 
only 
method 
making 
for 
rationality 
and 
calculation 
in 
the 
production 
of 
necessities. 
The 
profit 
earned 
by 
the 
entrepreneur 
is 
expressive 
of 
the 
fact 
that 



he 
has 
well 
served 
the 
consumers, 
that 
is, 
all 
the 
people. 
But 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
performance 
of 
bureaus 
no 
method 
for 
establishing 
success 
or 
failure 
by 
calculation 
procedures 
is 
available. 


In 
any 
socialist 
system 
the 
central 
board 
of 
production 
management 
alone 
would 
have 
the 
power 
to 
order, 
and 
everybody 
else 
would 
have 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
orders 
received. 
All 
people 
except 
the 
production 
czar 
would 
have 
to 
comply 
unconditionally 
with 
instructions, 
codes, 
rules, 
and 
regulations 
drafted 
by 
a 
superior 
body. 
Of 
course 
every 
citizen 
might 
have 
the 
right 
to 
suggest 
some 
changes 
in 
this 
immense 
system 
of 
regimentation. 
But 
the 
way 
from 
such 
a 
suggestion 
to 
its 
acceptance 
by 
the 
competent 
supreme 
authority 
would 
at 
best 
be 
as 
far 
and 
onerous 
as 
the 
way 
is 
today 
from 
a 
letter 
to 
the 
editor 
or 
an 
article 
in 
a 
periodical 
suggesting 
an 
amendment 
of 
a 
law 
to 
its 
passage 
by 
the 
legislature. 


There 
have 
been 
in 
the 
course 
of 
history 
many 
movements 
asking 
with 
enthusiasm 
and 
fanaticism 
for 
a 
reform 
of 
social 
institutions. 
People 
fought 
for 
their 
religious 
convictions, 
for 
the 
preservation 
of 
their 
civilization, 
for 
freedom, 
for 
self-determination, 
for 
the 
abolition 
of 
serfdom 
and 
slavery, 
for 
fairness 
and 
justice 
in 
court 
procedure. 
Today 
millions 
are 
fascinated 
by 
the 
plan 
to 
transform 
the 
whole 
world 
into 
a 
bureau, 
to 
make 
everybody 
a 
bureaucrat, 
and 
to 
wipe 
out 
any 
private 
initiative. 
The 
paradise 
of 
the 
future 
is 
visualized 
as 
an 
all-embracing 
bureaucratic 
apparatus. 
The 
most 
powerful 
reform 
movement 
that 
history 
has 
ever 
known, 
the 
first 
ideological 
trend 
not 
limited 
to 
a 
section 
of 
mankind 
only 
but 
supported 
by 
people 
of 
all 
races, 
nations, 
religions, 
and 
civilizations 
aims 
at 
all-round 
bureaucratization. 
The 
post 
office 
is 
the 
model 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
New 
Jerusalem. 
The 
post-
office 
clerk 
is 
the 
prototype 
of 
future 
man. 
Streams 
of 
blood 
have 
been 
shed 
for 
the 
realization 
of 
this 
ideal. 


In 
this 
book 
we 
are 
discussing 
not 
persons 
but 
systems 
of 
social 
organization. 
We 
do 
not 
mean 
that 
the 
post-office 
clerk 
is 
inferior 
to 
anybody 
else. 
What 
must 
be 
realized 
is 
only 
that 
the 
strait 
jacket 
of 
bureaucratic 
organization 
paralyzes 
the 
individual’s 
initiative, 
while 
within 
the 
capitalist 
market 
society 
an 
innovator 
still 
has 
a 
chance 
to 
succeed. 
The 
former 
makes 
for 
stagnation 
and 
preservation 
of 
inveterate 
methods, 
the 
latter 
makes 
for 
progress 
and 
improvement. 
Capitalism 
is 
progressive, 
socialism 
is 
not. 
One 
does 
not 



invalidate 
this 
argument 
by 
pointing 
out 
that 
the 
Bolshevists 
have 
copied 
various 
American 
innovations. 
So 
did 
all 
oriental 
peoples. 
But 
it 
is 
a 
non 
sequitur 
to 
deduce 
from 
this 
fact 
that 
all 
civilized 
nations 
must 
copy 
the 
Russian 
methods 
of 
social 
organization. 


The 
champions 
of 
socialism 
call 
themselves 
progressives, 
but 
they 
recommend 
a 
system 
which 
is 
characterized 
by 
rigid 
observance 
of 
routine 
and 
by 
a 
resistance 
to 
every 
kind 
of 
improvement. 
They 
call 
themselves 
liberals, 
but 
they 
are 
intent 
upon 
abolishing 
liberty. 
They 
call 
themselves 
democrats, 
but 
they 
yearn 
for 
dictatorship. 
They 
call 
themselves 
revolutionaries, 
but 
they 
want 
to 
make 
the 
government 
omnipotent. 
They 
promise 
the 
blessings 
of 
the 
Garden 
of 
Eden, 
but 
they 
plan 
to 
transform 
the 
world 
into 
a 
gigantic 
post 
office. 
Every 
man 
but 
one 
a 
subordinate 
clerk 
in 
a 
bureau, 
what 
an 
alluring 
utopia! 
What 
a 
noble 
cause 
to 
fight 
for! 


Against 
all 
this 
frenzy 
of 
agitation 
there 
is 
but 
one 
weapon 
available: 
reason. 
Just 
common 
sense 
is 
needed 
to 
prevent 
man 
from 
falling 
prey 
to 
illusory 
fantasies 
and 
empty 
catchwords.
