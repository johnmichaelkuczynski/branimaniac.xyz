Foreword 


Any 
political 
philosophy 
must 
address 
itself 
to 
a 
central 
question: 
under 
what 
conditions 
is 
the 
initiation 
of 
violence 
to 
be 
considered 
legitimate? 
One 
philosophy 
may 
endorse 
such 
violence 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
interests 
of 
a 
majority 
racial 
group, 
as 
with 
the 
National 
Socialists 
of 
Germany. 
Another 
may 
endorse 
it 
on 
behalf 
of 
a 
particular 
economic 
class, 
as 
with 
the 
Bolsheviks 
of 
Soviet 
Russia. 
Still 
another 
may 
prefer 
to 
avoid 
a 
doctrinaire 
position 
one 
way 
or 
another, 
leaving 
it 
to 
the 
good 
judgment 
of 
those 
who 
administer 
the 
state 
to 
decide 
when 
the 
common 
good 
demands 
the 
initiation 
of 
violence 
and 
when 
it 
does 
not. 
This 
is 
the 
stance 
of 
the 
social 
democracies. 


The 
liberal 
sets 
a 
very 
high 
threshold 
for 
the 
initiation 
of 
violence. 
Beyond 
the 
minimal 
taxation 
necessary 
to 
maintain 
legal 
and 
defense 
services 
—and 
some 
liberals 
shrink 
even 
from 
this— 
he 
denies 
to 
the 
state 
the 
power 
to 
initiate 
violence 
and 
seeks 
only 
peaceful 
remedies 
to 
perceived 
social 
ills. 
He 
opposes 
violence 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
redistributing 
wealth, 
of 
enriching 
influential 
pressure 
groups, 
or 
trying 
to 
improve 
man’s 
moral 
condition. 
Civilized 
people, 
says 
the 
liberal, 
interact 
with 
each 
other 
not 
according 
to 
the 
law 
of 
the 
jungle, 
but 
by 
means 
of 
reason 
and 
discussion. 
Man 
is 
not 
to 
be 
made 
good 
by 
means 
of 
the 
prison 
guard 
and 
the 
hangman; 
should 
they 
be 
necessary 
to 
make 
him 
good, 
his 
moral 
condition 
is 
already 
beyond 
salvage. 
As 
Ludwig 
von 
Mises 
puts 
it 
in 
this 
seminal 
book, 
modern 
man 
“must 
free 
himself 
from 
the 
habit, 
just 
as 
soon 
as 
something 
does 
not 
please 
him, 
of 
calling 
for 
the 
police.” 


There 
has 
been 
something 
of 
a 
renaissance 
in 
Misesian 
studies 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
the 
financial 
crisis 
that 
first 
gripped 
the 
world 
in 
2007 
and 
2008, 
since 
it 
was 
followers 
of 
Mises 
who 
had 
the 
most 
compelling 
explanations 
for 
economic 
phenomena 
that 
left 
most 
so-called 
experts 
stammering. 
The 
importance 
of 
Mises’s 
economic 
contributions 
to 
modern-day 
discussion 
is 
apt 
to 
make 
us 
overlook 
his 
contributions 
as 
a 
social 
theorist 
and 
political 
philosopher. 
The 
republication 
of 
Liberalism 
helps 
to 
rectify 
this 
oversight. 


The 
liberalism 
that 
Mises 
describes 
here 
is, 
of 
course, 
not 
the 
“liberalism” 
of 
the 
United 
States 
today, 
but 
rather 
classical 
liberalism, 
which 



is 
how 
the 
term 
continues 
to 
be 
understood 
in 
Europe. 
Classical 
liberalism 
stands 
for 
individual 
liberty, 
private 
property, 
free 
trade, 
and 
peace, 
fundamental 
principles 
from 
which 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
liberal 
program 
can 
be 
deduced. 
(When 
the 
first 
English 
edition 
of 
Liberalism 
appeared 
in 
1962, 
Mises 
published 
it 
under 
the 
title 
The 
Free 
and 
Prosperous 
Commonwealth, 
in 
order 
not 
to 
confuse 
American 
readers 
who 
associated 
liberalism 
with 
a 
creed 
very 
different 
from 
the 
one 
he 
championed.) 


It 
is 
no 
insult 
to 
Mises 
to 
describe 
his 
defense 
of 
liberalism 
as 
parsimonious, 
in 
the 
sense 
that, 
following 
Occam’s 
Razor, 
he 
employs 
on 
its 
behalf 
no 
concepts 
not 
strictly 
necessary 
to 
his 
argument. 
Thus 
Mises 
makes 
no 
reference 
to 
natural 
rights, 
a 
concept 
that 
plays 
a 
central 
role 
in 
so 
many 
other 
expositions 
of 
liberalism. 
He 
focuses 
primarily 
on 
the 
necessity 
of 
large-scale 
social 
cooperation. 
This 
social 
cooperation, 
by 
which 
complex 
chains 
of 
production 
function 
to 
improve 
the 
general 
standard 
of 
living, 
can 
be 
brought 
about 
only 
by 
an 
economic 
system 
based 
on 
private 
property. 
Private 
property 
in 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
coupled 
with 
the 
progressive 
extension 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor, 
has 
helped 
to 
free 
mankind 
from 
the 
horrific 
afflictions 
that 
once 
confronted 
the 
human 
race: 
disease, 
grinding 
poverty, 
appalling 
rates 
of 
infant 
mortality, 
general 
squalor 
and 
filth, 
and 
radical 
economic 
insecurity, 
with 
people 
often 
living 
one 
bad 
harvest 
away 
from 
starvation. 
Until 
the 
market 
economy 
illustrated 
the 
wealth-creating 
possibilities 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor, 
it 
was 
taken 
for 
granted 
that 
these 
grotesque 
features 
of 
man’s 
condition 
were 
the 
fixed 
dictates 
of 
a 
cold 
and 
merciless 
nature, 
and 
thus 
unlikely 
to 
be 
substantially 
alleviated, 
much 
less 
conquered 
entirely, 
by 
human 
effort. 


Students 
have 
been 
taught 
for 
many 
generations 
to 
think 
of 
property 
as 
a 
dirty 
word, 
the 
very 
embodiment 
of 
avarice. 
Mises 
will 
have 
none 
of 
it. 
“If 
history 
could 
prove 
anything 
in 
regard 
to 
this 
question, 
it 
could 
only 
be 
that 
nowhere 
and 
at 
no 
time 
has 
there 
ever 
been 
a 
people 
which 
has 
raised 
itself 
without 
private 
property 
above 
a 
condition 
of 
the 
most 
oppressive 
penury 
and 
savagery 
scarcely 
distinguishable 
from 
animal 
existence.” 
Social 
cooperation, 
Mises 
shows, 
is 
impossible 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
private 
property, 
and 
any 
attempts 
to 
curtail 
the 
right 
of 
property 
undermine 
the 
central 
pillar 
of 
modern 
civilization. 


Indeed 
Mises 
firmly 
anchors 
liberalism 
to 
private 
property. 
He 
is 
all 
too 
aware 
that 
to 
champion 
property 
is 
to 
invite 
the 
accusation 
that 
liberalism 
is 



merely 
a 
veiled 
apologia 
for 
capital. 
“The 
enemies 
of 
liberalism 
have 
branded 
it 
as 
the 
party 
of 
the 
special 
interests 
of 
the 
capitalists,” 
Mises 
observes. 
“This 
is 
characteristic 
of 
their 
mentality. 
They 
simply 
cannot 
understand 
a 
political 
ideology 
as 
anything 
but 
the 
advocacy 
of 
certain 
special 
privileges 
opposed 
to 
the 
general 
welfare.” 
Mises 
shows 
in 
this 
book 
and 
throughout 
his 
corpus 
of 
work 
that 
the 
system 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
redounds 
to 
the 
benefit 
not 
merely 
of 
the 
direct 
owners 
of 
capital 
but 
indeed 
to 
all 
of 
society. 


There 
is, 
in 
fact, 
no 
particular 
reason 
that 
people 
in 
possession 
of 
great 
wealth 
should 
favor 
the 
liberal 
system 
of 
free 
competition, 
in 
which 
continuous 
effort 
must 
be 
exerted 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
desires 
of 
the 
consumers 
if 
that 
wealth 
is 
not 
to 
be 
whittled 
away. 
Those 
who 
possess 
great 
wealth— 
especially 
those 
who 
inherited 
that 
wealth—may 
in 
fact 
prefer 
to 
inhabit 
a 
system 
of 
intervention, 
which 
is 
more 
likely 
to 
keep 
existing 
patterns 
of 
wealth 
frozen. 
Little 
wonder 
that 
American 
business 
magazines 
during 
the 
Progressive 
Era 
are 
replete 
with 
calls 
for 
replacing 
laissez-faire, 
a 
system 
in 
which 
no 
one’s 
profits 
are 
protected, 
with 
government-sanctioned 
cartel 
and 
collusion 
devices. 


Naturally, 
given 
Mises’s 
emphasis 
on 
the 
centrality 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
to 
the 
maintenance 
and 
progress 
of 
civilization, 
he 
is 
particularly 
outspoken 
regarding 
the 
evils 
of 
aggressive 
war, 
which 
on 
top 
of 
its 
physical 
and 
human 
toll 
brings 
about 
the 
progressive 
impoverishment 
of 
mankind 
by 
its 
radical 
disruption 
of 
a 
harmonious 
structure 
of 
production 
that 
spans 
the 
entire 
globe. 
Mises, 
who 
rarely 
minces 
words 
but 
whose 
prose 
is 
generally 
elegant 
and 
restrained, 
speaks 
with 
indignation 
and 
outrage 
when 
the 
subject 
turns 
to 
European 
imperialism, 
a 
cause 
on 
whose 
behalf 
he 
will 
admit 
no 
arguments 
whatever. 
Just 
as 
his 
student, 
Murray 
Rothbard, 
would 
later 
identify 
war 
and 
peace 
as 
the 
foundational 
issue 
of 
the 
whole 
liberal 
program, 


Mises 
likewise 
insists 
that 
these 
questions 
cannot 
be 
neglected— 
as 
they 
so 
often 
are 
by 
classical 
liberals 
in 
our 
own 
time—in 
favor 
of 
safer, 
less 
politically 
sensitive 
issues. 


The 
principal 
tool 
of 
liberalism, 
Mises 
maintained, 
was 
reason. 
That 
does 
not 
mean 
Mises 
thought 
its 
entire 
program 
must 
be 
carried 
through 
by 
means 
of 
dense 
and 
elaborate 
academic 
treatises. 
He 
greatly 
admired 
those 
who 
brought 
its 
ideas 
to 
the 
stage, 
the 
silver 
screen, 
and 
to 
the 
world 
of 
published 
fiction. 
But 
it 
does 
mean 
that 
the 
cause 
must 
remain 
rooted 
in 



rational 
argument, 
a 
much 
sounder 
foundation 
than 
the 
fickle 
irrationalism 
of 
emotion 
and 
hysteria 
by 
which 
other 
ideologies 
seek 
to 
stir 
the 
masses. 
“Liberalism 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
all 
this,” 
Mises 
insists. 
“It 
has 
no 
party 
flower 
and 
no 
party 
color, 
no 
party 
song 
and 
no 
party 
idols, 
no 
symbols 
and 
no 
slogans. 
It 
has 
the 
substance 
and 
the 
arguments. 
These 
must 
lead 
it 
to 
victory.” 


Finally, 
a 
brief 
word 
on 
the 
translation. 
Ralph 
Raico’s 
elegant 
rendering 
of 
Mises’s 
words 
not 
only 
conveys 
the 
author’s 
ideas 
with 
precision 
and 
care, 
but 
also 
preserves 
his 
unique 
and 
captivating 
prose 
style. 
Readers 
of 
Mises’s 
later 
works, 
many 
of 
which 
appeared 
originally 
in 
English 
rather 
than 
in 
translation, 
will 
be 
struck 
by 
how 
skillfully 
Raico 
has 
captured 
the 
voice 
they 
discover 
in 
those 
books. 


We 
ought 
to 
rejoice 
at 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
Mises 
Institute’s 
new 
edition 
of 
this 
old 
classic, 
particularly 
at 
a 
such 
a 
perilous 
moment 
in 
history. 
With 
fiscal 
crises 
and 
the 
hard 
choices 
they 
demand 
threatening 
a 
wave 
of 
civil 
unrest 
across 
Europe, 
the 
impossible 
promises 
made 
by 
cash-strapped 
welfare 
states 
are 
becoming 
increasingly 
obvious. 
As 
Mises 
argued, 
there 
is 
no 
stable, 
long-term 
substitute 
for 
the 
free 
economy. 
Interventionism, 
even 
on 
behalf 
of 
such 
an 
ostensibly 
good 
cause 
as 
social 
welfare, 
creates 
more 
problems 
than 
it 
solves, 
thereby 
leading 
to 
still 
more 
intervention 
until 
the 
system 
is 
entirely 
socialized, 
if 
the 
collapse 
does 
not 
occur 
before 
then. 


Mises’s 
position 
runs 
counter 
to 
those 
who 
held 
that 
the 
market 
was 
indeed 
a 
place 
of 
rivalry 
and 
strife 
in 
which 
the 
gain 
of 
some 
implied 
losses 
to 
others. 
One 
thinks, 
for 
example, 
of 
David 
Ricardo, 
and 
his 
contention 
that 
wages 
and 
profits 
necessarily 
move 
in 
opposite 
directions. 
Thomas 
Malthus 
warned 
of 
a 
population 
catastrophe, 
which 
implied 
a 
conflict 
between 
some 
individuals 
(those 
already 
born) 
and 
others 
(namely, 
the 
alleged 
excess 
who 
followed 
later). 
Then, 
of 
course, 
there 
was 
the 
entire 
mercantilist 
tradition, 
which 
viewed 
trade 
and 
exchange 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
low-intensity 
warfare 
that 
yielded 
a 
definite 
set 
of 
winners 
and 
losers. 
Karl 
Marx 
set 
forth 
a 
classic 
statement 
of 
inherent 
class 
antagonism 
on 
the 
market 
in 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto. 
Even 
older 
than 
these 
figures 
was 
Michel 
de 
Montaigne 
(1533– 
1592), 
who 
argued 
in 
his 
essay 
“The 
Plight 
of 
One 
Man 
is 
the 
Benefit 
of 
Another” 
that 
“no 
profit 
can 
possibly 
be 
made 
but 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
another.” 
Mises 
later 
called 
this 
view 
the 
“Montaigne 
fallacy.” 


For 
the 
sake 
of 
civilization 
itself, 
Mises 
urges 
us 
to 
discard 
the 



mercantilist 
myths 
that 
pit 
the 
prosperity 
of 
one 
people 
against 
that 
of 
another, 
the 
socialist 
myths 
that 
describe 
the 
various 
social 
classes 
as 
mortal 
enemies, 
and 
the 
interventionist 
myths 
that 
seek 
prosperity 
through 
mutual 
plunder. 
In 
place 
of 
these 
juvenile 
and 
destructive 
misconceptions 
Mises 
advances 
a 
compelling 
argument 
for 
classical 
liberalism, 
which 
sees 
“economic 
harmonies”—to 
borrow 
Frederic 
Bastiat’s 
formulation—where 
others 
see 
antagonism

Classical 
liberalism, 
so 
ably 
defended 
here 
by 
Mises, 
seeks 
no 
coercively 
derived 
advantage 
for 
anyone, 
and 
for 
that 
very 
reason 
brings 
about 
the 
most 
satisfactory 
long-run 
results 
for 
everyone.

Preface 
to 
the 
English-Language 
Edition 


The 
social 
order 
created 
by 
the 
philosophy 
of 
the 
Enlightenment 
assigned 
supremacy 
to 
the 
common 
man. 
In 
his 
capacity 
as 
a 
consumer, 
the 
“regular 
fellow” 
was 
called 
upon 
to 
determine 
ultimately 
what 
should 
be 
produced, 
in 
what 
quantity 
and 
of 
what 
quality, 
by 
whom, 
how, 
and 
where; 
in 
his 
capacity 
as 
a 
voter, 
he 
was 
sovereign 
in 
directing 
his 
nation’s 
policies. 
In 
the 
precapitalistic 
society 
those 
had 
been 
paramount 
who 
had 
the 
strength 
to 
beat 
their 
weaker 
fellows 
into 
submission. 
The 
much 
decried 
“mechanism” 
of 
the 
free 
market 
leaves 
only 
one 
way 
open 
to 
the 
acquisition 
of 
wealth, 
viz., 
to 
succeed 
in 
serving 
the 
consumers 
in 
the 
best 
possible 
and 
cheapest 
way. 
To 
this 
“democracy” 
of 
the 
market 
corresponds, 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
conduct 
of 
affairs 
of 
state, 
the 
system 
of 
representative 
government. 
The 
greatness 
of 
the 
period 
between 
the 
Napoleonic 
Wars 
and 
the 
first 
World 
War 
consisted 
precisely 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
social 
ideal 
after 
the 
realization 
of 
which 
the 
most 
eminent 
men 
were 
striving 
was 
free 
trade 
in 
a 
peaceful 
world 
of 
free 
nations. 
It 
was 
an 
age 
of 
unprecedented 
improvement 
in 
the 
standard 
of 
living 
for 
a 
rapidly 
increasing 
population. 
It 
was 
the 
age 
of 
liberalism. 


Today 
the 
tenets 
of 
this 
nineteenth-century 
philosophy 
of 
liberalism 
are 
almost 
forgotten. 
In 
continental 
Europe 
it 
is 
remembered 
only 
by 
a 
few. 
In 
England 
the 
term 
“liberal” 
is 
mostly 
used 
to 
signify 
a 
program 
that 
only 
in 
details 
differs 
from 
the 
totalitarianism 
of 
the 
socialists.[*] 
In 
the 
United 
States 
“liberal” 
means 
today 
a 
set 
of 
ideas 
and 
political 
postulates 
that 
in 
every 
regard 
are 
the 
opposite 
of 
all 
that 
liberalism 
meant 
to 
the 
preceding 
generations. 
The 
American 
self-styled 
liberal 
aims 
at 
government 
omnipotence, 
is 
a 
resolute 
foe 
of 
free 
enterprise, 
and 
advocates 
all-round 
planning 
by 
the 
authorities, 
i.e., 
socialism. 
These 
“liberals” 
are 
anxious 
to 
emphasize 
that 
they 
disapprove 
of 
the 
Russian 
dictator’s 
policies 
not 
on 
account 
of 
their 
socialistic 
or 
communistic 
character 
but 
merely 
on 
account 
of 
their 
imperialistic 
tendencies. 
Every 
measure 
aiming 
at 
confiscating 
some 
of 
the 
assets 
of 
those 
who 
own 
more 
than 
the 
average 
or 
at 
restricting 
the 
rights 



of 
the 
owners 
of 
property 
is 
considered 
as 
liberal 
and 
progressive. 
Practically 
unlimited 
discretionary 
power 
is 
vested 
in 
government 
agencies 
the 
decisions 
of 
which 
are 
exempt 
from 
judicial 
review. 
The 
few 
upright 
citizens 
who 
dare 
to 
criticize 
this 
trend 
toward 
administrative 
despotism 
are 
branded 
as 
extremists, 
reactionaries, 
economic 
royalists, 
and 
Fascists. 
It 
is 
suggested 
that 
a 
free 
country 
ought 
not 
to 
tolerate 
political 
activities 
on 
the 
part 
of 
such 
“public 
enemies.” 


Surprisingly 
enough, 
these 
ideas 
are 
in 
this 
country 
viewed 
as 
specifically 
American, 
as 
the 
continuation 
of 
the 
principles 
and 
the 
philosophy 
of 
the 
Pilgrim 
Fathers, 
the 
signers 
of 
the 
Declaration 
of 
Independence, 
and 
the 
authors 
of 
the 
Constitution 
and 
the 
Federalist 
papers. 
Only 
few 
people 
realize 
that 
these 
allegedly 
progressive 
policies 
originated 
in 
Europe 
and 
that 
their 
most 
brilliant 
nineteenth-century 
exponent 
was 
Bismarck, 
whose 
policies 
no 
American 
would 
qualify 
as 
progressive 
and 
liberal. 
Bismarck’s 
Sozialpolitik 
was 
inaugurated 
in 
1881, 
more 
than 
fifty 
years 
before 
its 
replica, 
F. 
D. 
Roosevelt’s 
New 
Deal. 
Following 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
the 
German 
Reich, 
the 
then 
most 
successful 
power, 
all 
European 
industrial 
nations 
more 
or 
less 
adopted 
the 
system 
that 
pretended 
to 
benefit 
the 
masses 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
a 
minority 
of 
“rugged 
individualists.” 
The 
generation 
that 
reached 
voting 
age 
after 
the 
end 
of 
the 
first 
World 
War 
took 
statism 
for 
granted 
and 
had 
only 
contempt 
for 
the 
“bourgeois 
prejudice,” 
liberty. 


When, 
thirty-five 
years 
ago, 
I 
tried 
to 
give 
a 
summary 
of 
the 
ideas 
and 
principles 
of 
that 
social 
philosophy 
that 
was 
once 
known 
under 
the 
name 
of 
liberalism, 
I 
did 
not 
indulge 
in 
the 
vain 
hope 
that 
my 
account 
would 
prevent 
the 
impending 
catastrophes 
to 
which 
the 
policies 
adopted 
by 
the 
European 
nations 
were 
manifestly 
leading. 
All 
I 
wanted 
to 
achieve 
was 
to 
offer 
to 
the 
small 
minority 
of 
thoughtful 
people 
an 
opportunity 
to 
learn 
something 
about 
the 
aims 
of 
classical 
liberalism 
and 
its 
achievements 
and 
thus 
to 
pave 
the 
way 
for 
a 
resurrection 
of 
the 
spirit 
of 
freedom 
after 
the 
coming 
debacle. 


On 
October 
28, 
1951, 
Professor 
T. 
P. 
Hamilius 
of 
Luxembourg 
ordered 
a 
copy 
of 
Liberalismus 
from 
the 
publishing 
firm 
of 
Gustav 
Fischer 
in 
Jena 
(Russian 
Zone 
of 
Germany). 
The 
publishing 
firm 
answered, 
on 
November 
14, 
1951, 
that 
no 
copies 
of 
the 
book 
were 
available 
and 
added: 
“Die 
Vorräte 
dieser 
Schrift 
mussten 
auf 
Anordnung 
behördlicher 
Stellen 
restlos 
makuliert 
werden.” 
(By 
order 
of 
the 
authorities 
all 
the 
copies 
of 
this 
book 
had 
to 
be 
destroyed.) 
The 
letter 
did 
not 
say 
whether 
the 
“authorities” 
referred 
to 
were 



those 
of 
Nazi 
Germany 
or 
those 
of 
the 
“democratic” 
republic 
of 
East 
Germany. 


In 
the 
years 
that 
elapsed 
since 
the 
publication 
of 
Liberalismus 
I 
have 
written 
much 
more 
about 
the 
problems 
involved. 
I 
have 
dealt 
with 
many 
issues 
with 
which 
I 
could 
not 
deal 
in 
a 
book 
the 
size 
of 
which 
had 
to 
be 
limited 
in 
order 
not 
to 
deter 
the 
general 
reader. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
I 
referred 
in 
it 
to 
some 
matters 
that 
have 
little 
importance 
for 
the 
present. 
There 
are, 
moreover, 
in 
this 
book 
various 
problems 
of 
policy 
treated 
in 
a 
way 
which 
can 
be 
understood 
and 
correctly 
appreciated 
only 
if 
one 
takes 
into 
account 
the 
political 
and 
economic 
situation 
at 
the 
time 
in 
which 
it 
was 
written. 


I 
have 
not 
changed 
anything 
in 
the 
original 
text 
of 
the 
book 
and 
did 
not 
influence 
in 
any 
way 
the 
translation 
made 
by 
Dr. 
Ralph 
Raico 
and 
the 
editing 
done 
by 
Mr. 
Arthur 
Goddard. 
I 
am 
very 
grateful 
to 
these 
two 
scholars 
for 
the 
pains 
they 
took 
in 
making 
the 
book 
available 
to 
the 
English-reading 
public.

one 
should

the

cause 
of 
genuine 
liberalism.

Introduction 


1. 
Liberalism 
The 
philosophers, 
sociologists, 
and 
economists 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
and 
the 
early 
part 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
formulated 
a 
political 
program 
that 
served 
as 
a 
guide 
to 
social 
policy 
first 
in 
England 
and 
the 
United 
States, 
then 
on 
the 
European 
continent, 
and 
finally 
in 
the 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
inhabited 
world 
as 
well. 
Nowhere 
was 
this 
program 
ever 
completely 
carried 
out. 
Even 
in 
England, 
which 
has 
been 
called 
the 
homeland 
of 
liberalism 
and 
the 
model 
liberal 
country, 
the 
proponents 
of 
liberal 
policies 
never 
succeeded 
in 
winning 
all 
their 
demands. 
In 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
world 
only 
parts 
of 
the 
liberal 
program 
were 
adopted, 
while 
others, 
no 
less 
important, 
were 
either 
rejected 
from 
the 
very 
first 
or 
discarded 
after 
a 
short 
time. 
Only 
with 
some 
exaggeration 
can 
one 
say 
that 
the 
world 
once 
lived 
through 
a 
liberal 
era. 
Liberalism 
was 
never 
permitted 
to 
come 
to 
full 
fruition. 


Nevertheless, 
brief 
and 
all 
too 
limited 
as 
the 
supremacy 
of 
liberal 
ideas 
was, 
it 
sufficed 
to 
change 
the 
face 
of 
the 
earth. 
A 
magnificent 
economic 
development 
took 
place. 
The 
release 
of 
man’s 
productive 
powers 
multiplied 
the 
means 
of 
subsistence 
many 
times 
over. 
On 
the 
eve 
of 
the 
World 
War 
(which 
was 
itself 
the 
result 
of 
a 
long 
and 
bitter 
struggle 
against 
the 
liberal 
spirit 
and 
which 
ushered 
in 
a 
period 
of 
still 
more 
bitter 
attacks 
on 
liberal 
principles), 
the 
world 
was 
incomparably 
more 
densely 
populated 
than 
it 
had 
ever 
been, 
and 
each 
inhabitant 
could 
live 
incomparably 
better 
than 
had 
been 
possible 
in 
earlier 
centuries. 
The 
prosperity 
that 
liberalism 
had 
created 
reduced 
considerably 
infant 
mortality, 
which 
had 
been 
the 
pitiless 
scourge 
of 
earlier 
ages, 
and, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
improvement 
in 
living 
conditions, 
lengthened 
the 
average 
span 
of 
life. 


Nor 
did 
this 
prosperity 
flow 
only 
to 
a 
select 
class 
of 
privileged 
persons. 
On 
the 
eve 
of 
the 
World 
War 
the 
worker 
in 
the 
industrial 
nations 
of 
Europe, 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
and 
in 
the 
overseas 
dominions 
of 
England 
lived 
better 
and 
more 
graciously 
than 
the 
nobleman 
of 
not 
too 
long 
before. 
Not 
only 
could 
he 
eat 
and 
drink 
according 
to 
his 
desire; 
he 
could 
give 
his 
children 
a 



better 
education; 
he 
could, 
if 
he 
wished, 
take 
part 
in 
the 
intellectual 
and 
cultural 
life 
of 
his 
nation; 
and, 
if 
he 
possessed 
enough 
talent 
and 
energy, 
he 
could, 
without 
difficulty, 
raise 
his 
social 
position. 
It 
was 
precisely 
in 
the 
countries 
that 
had 
gone 
the 
farthest 
in 
adopting 
the 
liberal 
program 
that 
the 
top 
of 
the 
social 
pyramid 
was 
composed, 
in 
the 
main, 
not 
of 
those 
who 
had, 
from 
their 
very 
birth, 
enjoyed 
a 
privileged 
position 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
wealth 
or 
high 
rank 
of 
their 
parents, 
but 
of 
those 
who, 
under 
favorable 
conditions, 
had 
worked 
their 
way 
up 
from 
straitened 
circumstances 
by 
their 
own 
power. 
The 
barriers 
that 
had 
in 
earlier 
ages 
separated 
lords 
and 
serfs 
had 
fallen. 
Now 
there 
were 
only 
citizens 
with 
equal 
rights. 
No 
one 
was 
handicapped 
or 
persecuted 
on 
account 
of 
his 
nationality, 
his 
opinions, 
or 
his 
faith. 
Domestic 
political 
and 
religious 
persecutions 
had 
ceased, 
and 
international 
wars 
began 
to 
become 
less 
frequent. 
Optimists 
were 
already 
hailing 
the 
dawn 
of 
the 
age 
of 
eternal 
peace. 


But 
events 
have 
turned 
out 
otherwise. 
In 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
strong 
and 
violent 
opponents 
of 
liberalism 
sprang 
up 
who 
succeeded 
in 
wiping 
out 
a 
great 
part 
of 
what 
had 
been 
gained 
by 
the 
liberals. 
The 
world 
today 
wants 
to 
hear 
no 
more 
of 
liberalism. 
Outside 
England 
the 
term 
“liberalism” 
is 
frankly 
proscribed. 
In 
England, 
there 
are, 
to 
be 
sure, 
still 
“liberals,” 
but 
most 
of 
them 
are 
so 
in 
name 
only. 
In 
fact, 
they 
are 
rather 
moderate 
socialists. 
Everywhere 
today 
political 
power 
is 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
antiliberal 
parties. 
The 
program 
of 
antiliberalism 
unleashed 
the 
forces 
that 
gave 
rise 
to 
the 
great 
World 
War 
and, 
by 
virtue 
of 
import 
and 
export 
quotas, 
tariffs, 
migration 
barriers, 
and 
similar 
measures, 
has 
brought 
the 
nations 
of 
the 
world 
to 
the 
point 
of 
mutual 
isolation. 
Within 
each 
nation 
it 
has 
led 
to 
socialist 
experiments 
whose 
result 
has 
been 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
productivity 
of 
labor 
and 
a 
concomitant 
increase 
in 
want 
and 
misery. 
Whoever 
does 
not 
deliberately 
close 
his 
eyes 
to 
the 
facts 
must 
recognize 
everywhere 
the 
signs 
of 
an 
approaching 
catastrophe 
in 
world 
economy. 
Antiliberalism 
is 
heading 
toward 
a 
general 
collapse 
of 
civilization. 


If 
one 
wants 
to 
know 
what 
liberalism 
is 
and 
what 
it 
aims 
at, 
one 
cannot 
simply 
turn 
to 
history 
for 
the 
information 
and 
inquire 
what 
the 
liberal 
politicians 
stood 
for 
and 
what 
they 
accomplished. 
For 
liberalism 
nowhere 
succeeded 
in 
carrying 
out 
its 
program 
as 
it 
had 
intended. 


Nor 
can 
the 
programs 
and 
actions 
of 
those 
parties 
that 
today 
call 
themselves 
liberal 
provide 
us 
with 
any 
enlightenment 
concerning 
the 
nature 
of 
true 
liberalism. 
It 
has 
already 
been 
mentioned 
that 
even 
in 
England 
what 
is 



understood 
as 
liberalism 
today 
bears 
a 
much 
greater 
resemblance 
to 
Toryism 
and 
socialism 
than 
to 
the 
old 
program 
of 
the 
freetraders. 
If 
there 
are 
liberals 
who 
find 
it 
compatible 
with 
their 
liberalism 
to 
endorse 
the 
nationalization 
of 
railroads, 
of 
mines, 
and 
of 
other 
enterprises, 
and 
even 
to 
support 
protective 
tariffs, 
one 
can 
easily 
see 
that 
nowadays 
nothing 
is 
left 
of 
liberalism 
but 
the 
name. 


Nor 
does 
it 
any 
longer 
suffice 
today 
to 
form 
one’s 
idea 
of 
liberalism 
from 
a 
study 
of 
the 
writings 
of 
its 
great 
founders. 
Liberalism 
is 
not 
a 
completed 
doctrine 
or 
a 
fixed 
dogma. 
On 
the 
contrary: 
it 
is 
the 
application 
of 
the 
teachings 
of 
science 
to 
the 
social 
life 
of 
man. 
And 
just 
as 
economics, 
sociology, 
and 
philosophy 
have 
not 
stood 
still 
since 
the 
days 
of 
David 
Hume, 
Adam 
Smith, 
David 
Ricardo, 
Jeremy 
Bentham, 
and 
Wilhelm 
Humboldt, 
so 
the 
doctrine 
of 
liberalism 
is 
different 
today 
from 
what 
it 
was 
in 
their 
day, 
even 
though 
its 
fundamental 
principles 
have 
remained 
unchanged. 
For 
many 
years 
now 
no 
one 
has 
undertaken 
to 
present 
a 
concise 
statement 
of 
the 
essential 
meaning 
of 
that 
doctrine. 
This 
may 
serve 
to 
justify 
our 
present 
attempt 
at 
providing 
just 
such 
a 
work. 


2. 
Material 
Welfare 
Liberalism 
is 
a 
doctrine 
directed 
entirely 
towards 
the 
conduct 
of 
men 
in 
this 
world. 
In 
the 
last 
analysis, 
it 
has 
nothing 
else 
in 
view 
than 
the 
advancement 
of 
their 
outward, 
material 
welfare 
and 
does 
not 
concern 
itself 
directly 
with 
their 
inner, 
spiritual 
and 
metaphysical 
needs. 
It 
does 
not 
promise 
men 
happiness 
and 
contentment, 
but 
only 
the 
most 
abundant 
possible 
satisfaction 
of 
all 
those 
desires 
that 
can 
be 
satisfied 
by 
the 
things 
of 
the 
outer 
world. 


Liberalism 
has 
often 
been 
reproached 
for 
this 
purely 
external 
and 
materialistic 
attitude 
toward 
what 
is 
earthly 
and 
transitory. 
The 
life 
of 
man, 
it 
is 
said, 
does 
not 
consist 
in 
eating 
and 
drinking. 
There 
are 
higher 
and 
more 
important 
needs 
than 
food 
and 
drink, 
shelter 
and 
clothing. 
Even 
the 
greatest 
earthly 
riches 
cannot 
give 
man 
happiness; 
they 
leave 
his 
inner 
self, 
his 
soul, 
unsatisfied 
and 
empty. 
The 
most 
serious 
error 
of 
liberalism 
has 
been 
that 
it 
has 
had 
nothing 
to 
offer 
man’s 
deeper 
and 
nobler 
aspirations. 


But 
the 
critics 
who 
speak 
in 
this 
vein 
show 
only 
that 
they 
have 
a 
very 
imperfect 
and 
materialistic 
conception 
of 
these 
higher 
and 
nobler 
needs. 



Social 
policy, 
with 
the 
means 
that 
are 
at 
its 
disposal, 
can 
make 
men 
rich 
or 
poor, 
but 
it 
can 
never 
succeed 
in 
making 
them 
happy 
or 
in 
satisfying 
their 
inmost 
yearnings. 
Here 
all 
external 
expedients 
fail. 
All 
that 
social 
policy 
can 
do 
is 
to 
remove 
the 
outer 
causes 
of 
pain 
and 
suffering; 
it 
can 
further 
a 
system 
that 
feeds 
the 
hungry, 
clothes 
the 
naked, 
and 
houses 
the 
homeless. 
Happiness 
and 
contentment 
do 
not 
depend 
on 
food, 
clothing, 
and 
shelter, 
but, 
above 
all, 
on 
what 
a 
man 
cherishes 
within 
himself. 
It 
is 
not 
from 
a 
disdain 
of 
spiritual 
goods 
that 
liberalism 
concerns 
itself 
exclusively 
with 
man’s 
material 
wellbeing, 
but 
from 
a 
conviction 
that 
what 
is 
highest 
and 
deepest 
in 
man 
cannot 
be 
touched 
by 
any 
outward 
regulation. 
It 
seeks 
to 
produce 
only 
outer 
wellbeing 
because 
it 
knows 
that 
inner, 
spiritual 
riches 
cannot 
come 
to 
man 
from 
without, 
but 
only 
from 
within 
his 
own 
heart. 
It 
does 
not 
aim 
at 
creating 
anything 
but 
the 
outward 
preconditions 
for 
the 
development 
of 
the 
inner 
life. 
And 
there 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
that 
the 
relatively 
prosperous 
individual 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century 
can 
more 
readily 
satisfy 
his 
spiritual 
needs 
than, 
say, 
the 
individual 
of 
the 
tenth 
century, 
who 
was 
given 
no 
respite 
from 
anxiety 
over 
the 
problem 
of 
eking 
out 
barely 
enough 
for 
survival 
or 
from 
the 
dangers 
that 
threatened 
him 
from 
his 
enemies. 


To 
be 
sure, 
to 
those 
who, 
like 
the 
followers 
of 
many 
Asiatic 
and 
medieval 
Christian 
sects, 
accept 
the 
doctrine 
of 
complete 
asceticism 
and 
who 
take 
as 
the 
ideal 
of 
human 
life 
the 
poverty 
and 
freedom 
from 
want 
of 
the 
birds 
of 
the 
forest 
and 
the 
fish 
of 
the 
sea, 
we 
can 
make 
no 
reply 
when 
they 
reproach 
liberalism 
for 
its 
materialistic 
attitude. 
We 
can 
only 
ask 
them 
to 
let 
us 
go 
our 
way 
undisturbed, 
just 
as 
we 
do 
not 
hinder 
them 
from 
getting 
to 
heaven 
in 
their 
own 
fashion. 
Let 
them 
shut 
themselves 
up 
in 
their 
cells, 
away 
from 
men 
and 
the 
world, 
in 
peace. 


The 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
our 
contemporaries 
cannot 
understand 
the 
ascetic 
ideal. 
But 
once 
one 
rejects 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
ascetic 
conduct 
of 
life, 
one 
cannot 
reproach 
liberalism 
for 
aiming 
at 
outer 
well-being. 


3. 
Rationalism 
Liberalism 
is 
usually 
reproached, 
besides, 
for 
being 
rationalistic. 
It 
wants 
to 
regulate 
everything 
reasonably 
and 
thus 
fails 
to 
recognize 
that 
in 
human 
affairs 
great 
latitude 
is, 
and, 
indeed, 
must 
be, 
given 
to 
feelings 
and 
to 
the 
irrational 
generally—i.e., 
to 
what 
is 
unreasonable. 



Now 
liberalism 
is 
by 
no 
means 
unaware 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
men 
sometimes 
act 
unreasonably. 
If 
men 
always 
acted 
reasonably, 
it 
would 
be 
superfluous 
to 
exhort 
them 
to 
be 
guided 
by 
reason. 
Liberalism 
does 
not 
say 
that 
men 
always 
act 
intelligently, 
but 
rather 
that 
they 
ought, 
in 
their 
own 
rightly 
understood 
interest, 
always 
to 
act 
intelligently. 
And 
the 
essence 
of 
liberalism 
is 
just 
this, 
that 
it 
wants 
to 
have 
conceded 
to 
reason 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
social 
policy 
the 
acceptance 
that 
is 
conceded 
to 
it 
without 
dispute 
in 
all 
other 
spheres 
of 
human 
action. 


If, 
having 
been 
recommended 
a 
reasonable—i.e., 
hygienic—mode 
of 
life 
by 
his 
doctor, 
someone 
were 
to 
reply: 
“I 
know 
that 
your 
advice 
is 
reasonable; 
my 
feelings, 
however, 
forbid 
me 
to 
follow 
it. 
I 
want 
to 
do 
what 
is 
harmful 
for 
my 
health 
even 
though 
it 
may 
be 
unreasonable,” 
hardly 
anybody 
would 
regard 
his 
conduct 
as 
commendable. 
No 
matter 
what 
we 
undertake 
to 
do 
in 
life, 
in 
order 
to 
reach 
the 
goal 
that 
we 
have 
set 
for 
ourselves 
we 
endeavor 
to 
do 
it 
reasonably. 
The 
person 
who 
wants 
to 
cross 
a 
railroad 
track 
will 
not 
choose 
the 
very 
moment 
when 
a 
train 
is 
passing 
over 
the 
crossing. 
The 
person 
who 
wants 
to 
sew 
on 
a 
button 
will 
avoid 
pricking 
his 
finger 
with 
the 
needle. 
In 
every 
sphere 
of 
his 
practical 
activity 
man 
has 
developed 
a 
technique 
or 
a 
technology 
that 
indicates 
how 
one 
is 
to 
proceed 
if 
one 
does 
not 
want 
to 
behave 
in 
an 
unreasonable 
way. 
It 
is 
generally 
acknowledged 
that 
it 
is 
desirable 
for 
a 
man 
to 
acquire 
the 
techniques 
which 
he 
can 
make 
use 
of 
in 
life, 
and 
a 
person 
who 
enters 
a 
field 
whose 
techniques 
he 
has 
not 
mastered 
is 
derided 
as 
a 
bungler. 


Only 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
social 
policy, 
it 
is 
thought, 
should 
it 
be 
otherwise. 
Here, 
not 
reason, 
but 
feelings 
and 
impulses 
should 
decide. 
The 
question: 
How 
must 
things 
be 
arranged 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
good 
illumination 
during 
the 
hours 
of 
darkness? 
is 
generally 
discussed 
only 
with 
reasonable 
arguments. 
As 
soon, 
however, 
as 
the 
point 
in 
the 
discussion 
is 
reached 
when 
it 
is 
to 
be 
decided 
whether 
the 
lighting 
plant 
should 
be 
managed 
by 
private 
individuals 
or 
by 
the 
municipality, 
then 
reason 
is 
no 
longer 
considered 
valid. 
Here 
sentiment, 
world 
view—in 
short, 
unreason—should 
determine 
the 
result. 
We 
ask 
in 
vain: 
Why? 


The 
organization 
of 
human 
society 
according 
to 
the 
pattern 
most 
suitable 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
ends 
in 
view 
is 
a 
quite 
prosaic 
and 
matter-
of-fact 
question, 
not 
unlike, 
say, 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
railroad 
or 
the 
production 
of 
cloth 
or 
furniture. 
National 
and 
governmental 
affairs 
are, 
it 
is 



true, 
more 
important 
than 
all 
other 
practical 
questions 
of 
human 
conduct, 
since 
the 
social 
order 
furnishes 
the 
foundation 
for 
everything 
else, 
and 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
each 
individual 
to 
prosper 
in 
the 
pursuit 
of 
his 
ends 
only 
in 
a 
society 
propitious 
for 
their 
attainment. 
But 
however 
lofty 
may 
be 
the 
sphere 
in 
which 
political 
and 
social 
questions 
are 
placed, 
they 
still 
refer 
to 
matters 
that 
are 
subject 
to 
human 
control 
and 
must 
consequently 
be 
judged 
according 
to 
the 
canons 
of 
human 
reason. 
In 
such 
matters, 
no 
less 
than 
in 
all 
our 
other 
mundane 
affairs, 
mysticism 
is 
only 
an 
evil. 
Our 
powers 
of 
comprehension 
are 
very 
limited. 
We 
cannot 
hope 
ever 
to 
discover 
the 
ultimate 
and 
most 
profound 
secrets 
of 
the 
universe. 
But 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
can 
never 
fathom 
the 
meaning 
and 
purpose 
of 
our 
existence 
does 
not 
hinder 
us 
from 
taking 
precautions 
to 
avoid 
contagious 
diseases 
or 
from 
making 
use 
of 
the 
appropriate 
means 
to 
feed 
and 
clothe 
ourselves, 
nor 
should 
it 
deter 
us 
from 
organizing 
society 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
the 
earthly 
goals 
for 
which 
we 
strive 
can 
be 
most 
effectually 
attained. 
Even 
the 
state 
and 
the 
legal 
system, 
the 
government 
and 
its 
administration 
are 
not 
too 
lofty, 
too 
good, 
too 
grand, 
for 
us 
to 
bring 
them 
within 
the 
range 
of 
rational 
deliberation. 
Problems 
of 
social 
policy 
are 
problems 
of 
social 
technology, 
and 
their 
solution 
must 
be 
sought 
in 
the 
same 
ways 
and 
by 
the 
same 
means 
that 
are 
at 
our 
disposal 
in 
the 
solution 
of 
other 
technical 
problems: 
by 
rational 
reflection 
and 
by 
examination 
of 
the 
given 
conditions. 
All 
that 
man 
is 
and 
all 
that 
raises 
him 
above 
the 
animals 
he 
owes 
to 
his 
reason. 
Why 
should 
he 
forgo 
the 
use 
of 
reason 
just 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
social 
policy 
and 
trust 
to 
vague 
and 
obscure 
feelings 
and 
impulses? 


4. 
The 
Aim 
of 
Liberalism 
There 
is 
a 
widespread 
opinion 
that 
liberalism 
is 
distinguished 
from 
other 
political 
movements 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
places 
the 
interests 
of 
a 
part 
of 
society 
—the 
propertied 
classes, 
the 
capitalists, 
the 
entrepreneurs—above 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
other 
classes. 
This 
assertion 
is 
completely 
mistaken. 
Liberalism 
has 
always 
had 
in 
view 
the 
good 
of 
the 
whole, 
not 
that 
of 
any 
special 
group. 
It 
was 
this 
that 
the 
English 
utilitarians 
meant 
to 
express— 
although, 
it 
is 
true, 
not 
very 
aptly—in 
their 
famous 
formula, 
“the 
greatest 
happiness 
of 
the 
greatest 
number.” 
Historically, 
liberalism 
was 
the 
first 
political 
movement 
that 
aimed 
at 
promoting 
the 
welfare 
of 
all, 
not 
that 
of 
special 
groups. 
Liberalism 
is 
distinguished 
from 
socialism, 
which 
likewise 



professes 
to 
strive 
for 
the 
good 
of 
all, 
not 
by 
the 
goal 
at 
which 
it 
aims, 
but 
by 
the 
means 
that 
it 
chooses 
to 
attain 
that 
goal. 


If 
it 
is 
maintained 
that 
the 
consequence 
of 
a 
liberal 
policy 
is 
or 
must 
be 
to 
favor 
the 
special 
interests 
of 
certain 
strata 
of 
society, 
this 
is 
still 
a 
question 
that 
allows 
of 
discussion. 
It 
is 
one 
of 
the 
tasks 
of 
the 
present 
work 
to 
show 
that 
such 
a 
reproach 
is 
in 
no 
way 
justified. 
But 
one 
cannot, 
from 
the 
very 
outset, 
impute 
unfairness 
to 
the 
person 
who 
raises 
it; 
though 
we 
consider 
his 
opinion 
incorrect, 
it 
could 
very 
well 
be 
advanced 
in 
the 
best 
of 
faith. 
In 
any 
case, 
whoever 
attacks 
liberalism 
in 
this 
way 
concedes 
that 
its 
intentions 
are 
disinterested 
and 
that 
it 
wants 
nothing 
but 
what 
it 
says 
it 
wants. 


Quite 
different 
are 
those 
critics 
of 
liberalism 
who 
reproach 
it 
for 
wanting 
to 
promote, 
not 
the 
general 
welfare, 
but 
only 
the 
special 
interests 
of 
certain 
classes. 
Such 
critics 
are 
both 
unfair 
and 
ignorant. 
By 
choosing 
this 
mode 
of 
attack, 
they 
show 
that 
they 
are 
inwardly 
well 
aware 
of 
the 
weakness 
of 
their 
own 
case. 
They 
snatch 
at 
poisoned 
weapons 
because 
they 
cannot 
otherwise 
hope 
for 
success. 


If 
a 
doctor 
shows 
a 
patient 
who 
craves 
food 
detrimental 
to 
his 
health 
the 
perversity 
of 
his 
desire, 
no 
one 
will 
be 
so 
foolish 
as 
to 
say: 
“The 
doctor 
does 
not 
care 
for 
the 
good 
of 
the 
patient; 
whoever 
wishes 
the 
patient 
well 
must 
not 
grudge 
him 
the 
enjoyment 
of 
relishing 
such 
delicious 
food.” 
Everyone 
will 
understand 
that 
the 
doctor 
advises 
the 
patient 
to 
forgo 
the 
pleasure 
that 
the 
enjoyment 
of 
the 
harmful 
food 
affords 
solely 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
injuring 
his 
health. 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
matter 
concerns 
social 
policy, 
one 
is 
prone 
to 
consider 
it 
quite 
differently. 
When 
the 
liberal 
advises 
against 
certain 
popular 
measures 
because 
he 
expects 
harmful 
consequences 
from 
them, 
he 
is 
censured 
as 
an 
enemy 
of 
the 
people, 
and 
praise 
is 
heaped 
on 
the 
demagogues 
who, 
without 
consideration 
of 
the 
harm 
that 
will 
follow, 
recommend 
what 
seems 
to 
be 
expedient 
for 
the 
moment. 


Reasonable 
action 
is 
distinguished 
from 
unreasonable 
action 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
involves 
provisional 
sacrifices. 
The 
latter 
are 
only 
apparent 
sacrifices, 
since 
they 
are 
outweighed 
by 
the 
favorable 
consequences 
that 
later 
ensue. 
The 
person 
who 
avoids 
tasty 
but 
unwholesome 
food 
makes 
merely 
a 
provisional, 
a 
seeming 
sacrifice. 
The 
outcome—the 
nonoccurrence 
of 
injury 
to 
his 
health—shows 
that 
he 
has 
not 
lost, 
but 
gained. 
To 
act 
in 
this 
way, 
however, 
requires 
insight 
into 
the 
consequences 
of 
one’s 
action. 
The 
demagogue 
takes 
advantage 
of 
this 
fact. 
He 
opposes 
the 
liberal, 
who 
calls 
for 



provisional 
and 
merely 
apparent 
sacrifices, 
and 
denounces 
him 
as 
a 
hardhearted 
enemy 
of 
the 
people, 
meanwhile 
setting 
himself 
up 
as 
a 
friend 
of 
humanity. 
In 
supporting 
the 
measures 
he 
advocates, 
he 
knows 
well 
how 
to 
touch 
the 
hearts 
of 
his 
hearers 
and 
to 
move 
them 
to 
tears 
with 
allusions 
to 
want 
and 
misery. 


Antiliberal 
policy 
is 
a 
policy 
of 
capital 
consumption. 
It 
recommends 
that 
the 
present 
be 
more 
abundantly 
provided 
for 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
future. 
It 
is 
in 
exactly 
the 
same 
case 
as 
the 
patient 
of 
whom 
we 
have 
spoken. 
In 
both 
instances 
a 
relatively 
grievous 
disadvantage 
in 
the 
future 
stands 
in 
opposition 
to 
a 
relatively 
abundant 
momentary 
gratification. 
To 
talk, 
in 
such 
a 
case, 
as 
if 
the 
question 
were 
one 
of 
hard-heartedness 
versus 
philanthropy 
is 
downright 
dishonest 
and 
untruthful. 
It 
is 
not 
only 
the 
common 
run 
of 
politicians 
and 
the 
press 
of 
the 
antiliberal 
parties 
that 
are 
open 
to 
such 
a 
reproach. 
Almost 
all 
the 
writers 
of 
the 
school 
of 
Sozialpolitik 
have 
made 
use 
of 
this 
underhanded 
mode 
of 
combat. 


That 
there 
is 
want 
and 
misery 
in 
the 
world 
is 
not, 
as 
the 
average 
newspaper 
reader, 
in 
his 
dullness, 
is 
only 
too 
prone 
to 
believe, 
an 
argument 
against 
liberalism. 
It 
is 
precisely 
want 
and 
misery 
that 
liberalism 
seeks 
to 
abolish, 
and 
it 
considers 
the 
means 
that 
it 
proposes 
the 
only 
suitable 
ones 
for 
the 
achievement 
of 
this 
end. 
Let 
whoever 
thinks 
that 
he 
knows 
a 
better, 
or 
even 
a 
different, 
means 
to 
this 
end 
adduce 
the 
proof. 
The 
assertion 
that 
the 
liberals 
do 
not 
strive 
for 
the 
good 
of 
all 
members 
of 
society, 
but 
only 
for 
that 
of 
special 
groups, 
is 
in 
no 
way 
a 
substitute 
for 
this 
proof. 


The 
fact 
that 
there 
is 
want 
and 
misery 
would 
not 
constitute 
an 
argument 
against 
liberalism 
even 
if 
the 
world 
today 
followed 
a 
liberal 
policy. 
It 
would 
always 
be 
an 
open 
question 
whether 
still 
more 
want 
and 
misery 
might 
not 
prevail 
if 
other 
policies 
had 
been 
followed. 
In 
view 
of 
all 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
the 
functioning 
of 
the 
institution 
of 
private 
property 
is 
curbed 
and 
hindered 
in 
every 
quarter 
today 
by 
antiliberal 
policies, 
it 
is 
manifestly 
quite 
absurd 
to 
seek 
to 
infer 
anything 
against 
the 
correctness 
of 
liberal 
principles 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
economic 
conditions 
are 
not, 
at 
present, 
all 
that 
one 
could 
wish. 
In 
order 
to 
appreciate 
what 
liberalism 
and 
capitalism 
have 
accomplished, 
one 
should 
compare 
conditions 
as 
they 
are 
at 
present 
with 
those 
of 
the 
Middle 
Ages 
or 
of 
the 
first 
centuries 
of 
the 
modern 
era. 
What 
liberalism 
and 
capitalism 
could 
have 
accomplished 
had 
they 
been 
allowed 
free 
rein 
can 
be 
inferred 
only 
from 
theoretical 
considerations. 



5. 
Liberalism 
and 
Capitalism 
A 
society 
in 
which 
liberal 
principles 
are 
put 
into 
effect 
is 
usually 
called 
a 
capitalist 
society, 
and 
the 
condition 
of 
that 
society, 
capitalism. 
Since 
the 
economic 
policy 
of 
liberalism 
has 
everywhere 
been 
only 
more 
or 
less 
closely 
approximated 
in 
practice, 
conditions 
as 
they 
are 
in 
the 
world 
today 
provide 
us 
with 
but 
an 
imperfect 
idea 
of 
the 
meaning 
and 
possible 
accomplishments 
of 
capitalism 
in 
full 
flower. 
Nevertheless, 
one 
is 
altogether 
justified 
in 
calling 
our 
age 
the 
age 
of 
capitalism, 
because 
all 
that 
has 
created 
the 
wealth 
of 
our 
time 
can 
be 
traced 
back 
to 
capitalist 
institutions. 
It 
is 
thanks 
to 
those 
liberal 
ideas 
that 
still 
remain 
alive 
in 
our 
society, 
to 
what 
yet 
survives 
in 
it 
of 
the 
capitalist 
system, 
that 
the 
great 
mass 
of 
our 
contemporaries 
can 
enjoy 
a 
standard 
of 
living 
far 
above 
that 
which 
just 
a 
few 
generations 
ago 
was 
possible 
only 
to 
the 
rich 
and 
especially 
privileged. 


To 
be 
sure, 
in 
the 
customary 
rhetoric 
of 
the 
demagogues 
these 
facts 
are 
represented 
quite 
differently. 
To 
listen 
to 
them, 
one 
would 
think 
that 
all 
progress 
in 
the 
techniques 
of 
production 
redounds 
to 
the 
exclusive 
benefit 
of 
a 
favored 
few, 
while 
the 
masses 
sink 
ever 
more 
deeply 
into 
misery. 
However, 
it 
requires 
only 
a 
moment’s 
reflection 
to 
realize 
that 
the 
fruits 
of 
all 
technological 
and 
industrial 
innovations 
make 
for 
an 
improvement 
in 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
the 
wants 
of 
the 
great 
masses. 
All 
big 
industries 
that 
produce 
consumers’ 
goods 
work 
directly 
for 
their 
benefit; 
all 
industries 
that 
produce 
machines 
and 
half-finished 
products 
work 
for 
them 
indirectly. 
The 
great 
industrial 
developments 
of 
the 
last 
decades, 
like 
those 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
century 
that 
are 
designated 
by 
the 
not 
altogether 
happily 
chosen 
phrase, 
“the 
Industrial 
Revolution,” 
have 
resulted, 
above 
all, 
in 
a 
better 
satisfaction 
of 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
masses. 
The 
development 
of 
the 
clothing 
industry, 
the 
mechanization 
of 
shoe 
production, 
and 
improvements 
in 
the 
processing 
and 
distribution 
of 
foodstuffs 
have, 
by 
their 
very 
nature, 
benefited 
the 
widest 
public. 
It 
is 
thanks 
to 
these 
industries 
that 
the 
masses 
today 
are 
far 
better 
clothed 
and 
fed 
than 
ever 
before. 
However, 
mass 
production 
provides 
not 
only 
for 
food, 
shelter, 
and 
clothing, 
but 
also 
for 
other 
requirements 
of 
the 
multitude. 
The 
press 
serves 
the 
masses 
quite 
as 
much 
as 
the 
motion 
picture 
industry, 
and 
even 
the 
theater 
and 
similar 
strongholds 
of 
the 
arts 
are 
daily 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
places 
of 
mass 
entertainment. 



Nevertheless, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
zealous 
propaganda 
of 
the 
antiliberal 
parties, 
which 
twists 
the 
facts 
the 
other 
way 
round, 
people 
today 
have 
come 
to 
associate 
the 
ideas 
of 
liberalism 
and 
capitalism 
with 
the 
image 
of 
a 
world 
plunged 
into 
ever 
increasing 
misery 
and 
poverty. 
To 
be 
sure, 
no 
amount 
of 
depreciatory 
propaganda 
could 
ever 
succeed, 
as 
the 
demagogues 
had 
hoped, 
in 
giving 
the 
words 
“liberal” 
and 
“liberalism” 
a 
completely 
pejorative 
connotation. 
In 
the 
last 
analysis, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
brush 
aside 
the 
fact 
that, 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
the 
efforts 
of 
antiliberal 
propaganda, 
there 
is 
something 
in 
these 
expressions 
that 
suggests 
what 
every 
normal 
person 
feels 
when 
he 
hears 
the 
word 
“freedom.” 
Antiliberal 
propaganda, 
therefore, 
avoids 
mentioning 
the 
word 
“liberalism” 
too 
often 
and 
prefers 
the 
infamies 
that 
it 
attributes 
to 
the 
liberal 
system 
to 
be 
associated 
with 
the 
term 
“capitalism.” 
That 
word 
brings 
to 
mind 
a 
flint-hearted 
capitalist, 
who 
thinks 
of 
nothing 
but 
his 
own 
enrichment, 
even 
if 
that 
is 
possible 
only 
through 
the 
exploitation 
of 
his 
fellow 
men. 


It 
hardly 
occurs 
to 
anyone, 
when 
he 
forms 
his 
notion 
of 
a 
capitalist, 
that 
a 
social 
order 
organized 
on 
genuinely 
liberal 
principles 
is 
so 
constituted 
as 
to 
leave 
the 
entrepreneurs 
and 
the 
capitalists 
only 
one 
way 
to 
wealth, 
viz., 
by 
better 
providing 
their 
fellow 
men 
with 
what 
they 
themselves 
think 
they 
need. 
Instead 
of 
speaking 
of 
capitalism 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
prodigious 
improvement 
in 
the 
standard 
of 
living 
of 
the 
masses, 
antiliberal 
propaganda 
mentions 
capitalism 
only 
in 
referring 
to 
those 
phenomena 
whose 
emergence 
was 
made 
possible 
solely 
because 
of 
the 
restraints 
that 
were 
imposed 
upon 
liberalism. 
No 
reference 
is 
made 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
capitalism 
has 
placed 
a 
delectable 
luxury 
as 
well 
as 
a 
food, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
sugar, 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
the 
great 
masses. 
Capitalism 
is 
mentioned 
in 
connection 
with 
sugar 
only 
when 
the 
price 
of 
sugar 
in 
a 
country 
is 
raised 
above 
the 
world 
market 
price 
by 
a 
cartel. 
As 
if 
such 
a 
development 
were 
even 
conceivable 
in 
a 
social 
order 
in 
which 
liberal 
principles 
were 
put 
into 
effect! 
In 
a 
country 
with 
a 
liberal 
regime, 
in 
which 
there 
are 
no 
tariffs, 
cartels 
capable 
of 
driving 
the 
price 
of 
a 
commodity 
above 
the 
world 
market 
price 
would 
be 
quite 
unthinkable. 


The 
links 
in 
the 
chain 
of 
reasoning 
by 
which 
antiliberal 
demagogy 
succeeds 
in 
laying 
upon 
liberalism 
and 
capitalism 
the 
blame 
for 
all 
the 
excesses 
and 
evil 
consequences 
of 
antiliberal 
policies 
are 
as 
follows: 
One 
starts 
from 
the 
assumption 
that 
liberal 
principles 
aim 
at 
promoting 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
capitalists 
and 
entrepreneurs 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
interests 
of 



the 
rest 
of 
the 
population 
and 
that 
liberalism 
is 
a 
policy 
that 
favors 
the 
rich 
over 
the 
poor. 
Then 
one 
observes 
that 
many 
entrepreneurs 
and 
capitalists, 
under 
certain 
conditions, 
advocate 
protective 
tariffs, 
and 
still 
others—the 
armaments 
manufacturers—support 
a 
policy 
of 
“national 
preparedness”; 
and, 
out 
of 
hand, 
one 
jumps 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
these 
must 
be 
“capitalistic” 
policies. 


In 
fact, 
however, 
the 
case 
is 
quite 
otherwise. 
Liberalism 
is 
not 
a 
policy 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
any 
particular 
group, 
but 
a 
policy 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
all 
mankind. 
It 
is, 
therefore, 
incorrect 
to 
assert 
that 
the 
entrepreneurs 
and 
capitalists 
have 
any 
special 
interest 
in 
supporting 
liberalism. 
Their 
interest 
in 
championing 
the 
liberal 
program 
is 
exactly 
the 
same 
as 
that 
of 
everyone 
else. 
There 
may 
be 
individual 
cases 
in 
which 
some 
entrepreneurs 
or 
capitalists 
cloak 
their 
special 
interests 
in 
the 
program 
of 
liberalism; 
but 
opposed 
to 
these 
are 
always 
the 
special 
interests 
of 
other 
entrepreneurs 
or 
capitalists. 
The 
matter 
is 
not 
quite 
so 
simple 
as 
those 
who 
everywhere 
scent 
“interests” 
and 
“interested 
parties” 
imagine. 
That 
a 
nation 
imposes 
a 
tariff 
on 
iron, 
for 
example, 
cannot 
“simply” 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
this 
benefits 
the 
iron 
magnates. 
There 
are 
also 
persons 
with 
opposing 
interests 
in 
the 
country, 
even 
among 
the 
entrepreneurs; 
and, 
in 
any 
case, 
the 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
tariff 
on 
iron 
are 
a 
steadily 
diminishing 
minority. 
Nor 
can 
bribery 
be 
the 
explanation, 
for 
the 
people 
bribed 
can 
likewise 
be 
only 
a 
minority; 
and, 
besides, 
why 
does 
only 
one 
group, 
the 
protectionists, 
do 
the 
bribing, 
and 
not 
their 
opponents, 
the 
freetraders? 


The 
fact 
is 
that 
the 
ideology 
that 
makes 
the 
protective 
tariff 
possible 
is 
created 
neither 
by 
the 
“interested 
parties” 
nor 
by 
those 
bribed 
by 
them, 
but 
by 
the 
ideologists, 
who 
give 
the 
world 
the 
ideas 
that 
direct 
the 
course 
of 
all 
human 
affairs. 
In 
our 
age, 
in 
which 
antiliberal 
ideas 
prevail, 
virtually 
everyone 
thinks 
accordingly, 
just 
as, 
a 
hundred 
years 
ago, 
most 
people 
thought 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
then 
prevailing 
liberal 
ideology. 
If 
many 
entrepreneurs 
today 
advocate 
protective 
tariffs, 
this 
is 
nothing 
more 
than 
the 
form 
that 
antiliberalism 
takes 
in 
their 
case. 
It 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
liberalism. 


6. 
The 
Psychological 
Roots 
of 
Antiliberalism 
It 
cannot 
be 
the 
task 
of 
this 
book 
to 
discuss 
the 
problem 
of 
social 



cooperation 
otherwise 
than 
with 
rational 
arguments. 
But 
the 
root 
of 
the 
opposition 
to 
liberalism 
cannot 
be 
reached 
by 
resort 
to 
the 
method 
of 
reason. 
This 
opposition 
does 
not 
stem 
from 
the 
reason, 
but 
from 
a 
pathological 
mental 
attitude—from 
resentment 
and 
from 
a 
neurasthenic 
condition 
that 
one 
might 
call 
a 
Fourier 
complex, 
after 
the 
French 
socialist 
of 
that 
name. 


Concerning 
resentment 
and 
envious 
malevolence 
little 
need 
be 
said. 
Resentment 
is 
at 
work 
when 
one 
so 
hates 
somebody 
for 
his 
more 
favorable 
circumstances 
that 
one 
is 
prepared 
to 
bear 
heavy 
losses 
if 
only 
the 
hated 
one 
might 
also 
come 
to 
harm. 
Many 
of 
those 
who 
attack 
capitalism 
know 
very 
well 
that 
their 
situation 
under 
any 
other 
economic 
system 
will 
be 
less 
favorable. 
Nevertheless, 
with 
full 
knowledge 
of 
this 
fact, 
they 
advocate 
a 
reform, 
e.g., 
socialism, 
because 
they 
hope 
that 
the 
rich, 
whom 
they 
envy, 
will 
also 
suffer 
under 
it. 
Time 
and 
again 
one 
hears 
socialists 
say 
that 
even 
material 
want 
will 
be 
easier 
to 
bear 
in 
a 
socialist 
society 
because 
people 
will 
realize 
that 
no 
one 
is 
better 
off 
than 
his 
neighbor. 


At 
all 
events, 
resentment 
can 
still 
be 
dealt 
with 
by 
rational 
arguments. 
It 
is, 
after 
all, 
not 
too 
difficult 
to 
make 
clear 
to 
a 
person 
who 
is 
filled 
with 
resentment 
that 
the 
important 
thing 
for 
him 
cannot 
be 
to 
worsen 
the 
position 
of 
his 
better 
situated 
fellow 
men, 
but 
to 
improve 
his 
own. 


The 
Fourier 
complex 
is 
much 
harder 
to 
combat. 
What 
is 
involved 
in 
this 
case 
is 
a 
serious 
disease 
of 
the 
nervous 
system, 
a 
neurosis, 
which 
is 
more 
properly 
the 
concern 
of 
the 
psychologist 
than 
of 
the 
legislator. 
Yet 
it 
cannot 
be 
neglected 
in 
investigating 
the 
problems 
of 
modern 
society. 
Unfortunately, 
medical 
men 
have 
hitherto 
scarcely 
concerned 
themselves 
with 
the 
problems 
presented 
by 
the 
Fourier 
complex. 
Indeed, 
they 
have 
hardly 
been 
noticed 
even 
by 
Freud, 
the 
great 
master 
of 
psychology, 
or 
by 
his 
followers 
in 
their 
theory 
of 
neurosis, 
though 
it 
is 
to 
psycho-analysis 
that 
we 
are 
indebted 
for 
having 
opened 
up 
the 
path 
that 
alone 
leads 
to 
a 
coherent 
and 
systematic 
understanding 
of 
mental 
disorders 
of 
this 
kind. 


Scarcely 
one 
person 
in 
a 
million 
succeeds 
in 
fulfilling 
his 
life’s 
ambition. 
The 
upshot 
of 
one’s 
labors, 
even 
if 
one 
is 
favored 
by 
fortune, 
remains 
far 
inferior 
to 
what 
the 
wistful 
daydreams 
of 
youth 
allowed 
one 
to 
hope 
for. 
Plans 
and 
desires 
are 
shattered 
on 
a 
thousand 
obstacles, 
and 
one’s 
powers 
prove 
too 
weak 
to 
achieve 
the 
goals 
on 
which 
one 
has 
set 
one’s 
heart. 
The 
failure 
of 
his 
hopes, 
the 
frustration 
of 
his 
schemes, 
his 
own 
inadequacy 
in 
the 
face 
of 
the 
tasks 
that 
he 
has 
set 
himself—these 
constitute 
every 
man’s 



most 
deeply 
painful 
experience. 
They 
are, 
indeed, 
the 
common 
lot 
of 
man. 


There 
are 
two 
ways 
in 
which 
man 
can 
react 
to 
this 
experience. 
One 
way 
is 
indicated 
by 
the 
practical 
wisdom 
of 
Goethe: 


Dost 
thou 
fancy 
that 
I 
should 
hate 
life, 


Should 
flee 
to 
the 
wilderness, 


Because 
not 
all 
my 
budding 
dreams 
have 
blossomed? 


his 
Prometheus 
cries. 
And 
Faust 
recognizes 
at 
the 
“highest 
moment” 
that 
“the 
last 
word 
of 
wisdom” 
is: 


No 
man 
deserves 
his 
freedom 
or 
his 
life 
Who 
does 
not 
daily 
win 
them 
anew. 


Such 
a 
will 
and 
such 
a 
spirit 
cannot 
be 
vanquished 
by 
any 
earthly 
misfortune. 
He 
who 
accepts 
life 
for 
what 
it 
is 
and 
never 
allows 
himself 
to 
be 
overwhelmed 
by 
it 
does 
not 
need 
to 
seek 
refuge 
for 
his 
crushed 
self-
confidence 
in 
the 
solace 
of 
a 
“saving 
lie.” 
If 
the 
longed-for 
success 
is 
not 
forthcoming, 
if 
the 
vicissitudes 
of 
fate 
destroy 
in 
the 
twinkling 
of 
an 
eye 
what 
had 
to 
be 
painstakingly 
built 
up 
by 
years 
of 
hard 
work, 
then 
he 
simply 
multiplies 
his 
exertions. 
He 
can 
look 
disaster 
in 
the 
eye 
without 
despairing. 


The 
neurotic 
cannot 
endure 
life 
in 
its 
real 
form. 
It 
is 
too 
raw 
for 
him, 
too 
coarse, 
too 
common. 
To 
render 
it 
bearable 
he 
does 
not, 
like 
the 
healthy 
man, 
have 
the 
heart 
to 
“carry 
on 
in 
spite 
of 
everything.” 
That 
would 
not 
be 
in 
keeping 
with 
his 
weakness. 
Instead, 
he 
takes 
refuge 
in 
a 
delusion. 
A 
delusion 
is, 
according 
to 
Freud, 
“itself 
something 
desired, 
a 
kind 
of 
consolation”; 
it 
is 
characterized 
by 
its 
“resistance 
to 
attack 
by 
logic 
and 
reality.” 
It 
by 
no 
means 
suffices, 
therefore, 
to 
seek 
to 
talk 
the 
patient 
out 
of 
his 
delusion 
by 
conclusive 
demonstrations 
of 
its 
absurdity. 
In 
order 
to 
recuperate, 
the 
patient 
himself 
must 
overcome 
it. 
He 
must 
learn 
to 
understand 
why 
he 
does 
not 
want 
to 
face 
the 
truth 
and 
why 
he 
takes 
refuge 
in 
delusions. 


Only 
the 
theory 
of 
neurosis 
can 
explain 
the 
success 
enjoyed 
by 
Fourierism, 
the 
mad 
product 
of 
a 
seriously 
deranged 
brain. 
This 
is 
not 
the 
place 
to 
adduce 
evidence 
of 
Fourier’s 
psychosis 
by 
quoting 
passages 
from 
his 
writings. 
Such 
descriptions 
are 
of 
interest 
only 
to 
the 
psychiatrist 
and, 
perhaps, 
also 
to 
people 
who 
derive 
a 
certain 
pleasure 
from 
reading 
the 



productions 
of 
a 
lewd 
fantasy. 
But 
the 
fact 
is 
that 
Marxism, 
when 
it 
is 
obliged 
to 
leave 
the 
field 
of 
pompous 
dialectical 
rhetoric 
and 
the 
derision 
and 
defamation 
of 
its 
opponents 
and 
to 
make 
a 
few 
meager 
remarks 
pertinent 
to 
the 
issue, 
never 
has 
anything 
different 
to 
advance 
from 
what 
Fourier, 
the 
“utopian,” 
had 
to 
offer. 
Marxism 
is 
likewise 
unable 
to 
construct 
a 
picture 
of 
a 
socialist 
society 
without 
making 
two 
assumptions 
already 
made 
by 
Fourier 
that 
contradict 
all 
experience 
and 
all 
reason. 
On 
the 
one 
hand, 
it 
assumes 
that 
the 
“material 
substratum” 
of 
production, 
which 
is 
“already 
present 
in 
nature 
without 
the 
need 
of 
productive 
effort 
on 
the 
part 
of 
man,” 
stands 
at 
our 
disposal 
in 
such 
abundance 
that 
it 
need 
not 
be 
economized; 
hence 
the 
faith 
of 
Marxism 
in 
a 
“practically 
limitless 
increase 
in 
production.” 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
assumes 
that 
in 
a 
socialist 
community 
work 
will 
change 
from 
“a 
burden 
into 
a 
pleasure”—indeed, 
that 
it 
will 
become 
“the 
primary 
necessity 
of 
life.” 
Where 
a 
superfluity 
of 
all 
goods 
abounds 
and 
work 
is 
a 
pleasure, 
it 
is, 
doubtless, 
an 
easy 
matter 
to 
establish 
a 
land 
of 
Cockaigne. 


Marxism 
believes 
that 
from 
the 
height 
of 
its 
“scientific 
socialism” 
it 
is 
entitled 
to 
look 
down 
with 
contempt 
on 
romanticism 
and 
romantics. 
But 
in 
reality 
its 
own 
procedure 
is 
no 
different 
from 
theirs. 
Instead 
of 
removing 
the 
impediments 
that 
stand 
in 
the 
way 
of 
the 
realization 
of 
its 
desires, 
it 
too 
prefers 
to 
let 
all 
obstacles 
simply 
fade 
away 
in 
the 
mists 
of 
fantasy. 


In 
the 
life 
of 
the 
neurotic 
the 
“saving 
lie” 
has 
a 
double 
function. 
It 
not 
only 
consoles 
him 
for 
past 
failure, 
but 
holds 
out 
the 
prospect 
of 
future 
success. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
social 
failure, 
which 
alone 
concerns 
us 
here, 
the 
consolation 
consists 
in 
the 
belief 
that 
one’s 
inability 
to 
attain 
the 
lofty 
goals 
to 
which 
one 
has 
aspired 
is 
not 
to 
be 
ascribed 
to 
one’s 
own 
inadequacy, 
but 
to 
the 
defectiveness 
of 
the 
social 
order. 
The 
malcontent 
expects 
from 
the 
overthrow 
of 
the 
latter 
the 
success 
that 
the 
existing 
system 
has 
withheld 
from 
him. 
Consequently, 
it 
is 
entirely 
futile 
to 
try 
to 
make 
clear 
to 
him 
that 
the 
utopia 
he 
dreams 
of 
is 
not 
feasible 
and 
that 
the 
only 
foundation 
possible 
for 
a 
society 
organized 
on 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
is 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
The 
neurotic 
clings 
to 
his 
“saving 
lie,” 
and 
when 
he 
must 
make 
the 
choice 
of 
renouncing 
either 
it 
or 
logic, 
he 
prefers 
to 
sacrifice 
logic. 
For 
life 
would 
be 
unbearable 
for 
him 
without 
the 
consolation 
that 
he 
finds 
in 
the 
idea 
of 
socialism. 
It 
tells 
him 
that 
not 
he 
himself, 
but 
the 
world, 
is 
at 
fault 
for 
having 
caused 
his 
failure; 
and 
this 
conviction 
raises 
his 
depressed 
self-confidence 
and 
liberates 
him 
from 
a 



tormenting 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 


Just 
as 
the 
devout 
Christian 
could 
more 
easily 
endure 
the 
misfortune 
that 
befell 
him 
on 
earth 
because 
he 
hoped 
for 
a 
continuation 
of 
personal 
existence 
in 
another, 
better 
world, 
where 
those 
who 
on 
earth 
had 
been 
first 
would 
be 
last 
and 
the 
last 
would 
be 
first; 
so, 
for 
modern 
man, 
socialism 
has 
become 
an 
elixir 
against 
earthly 
adversity. 
But 
whereas 
the 
belief 
in 
immortality, 
in 
a 
recompense 
in 
the 
hereafter, 
and 
in 
resurrection 
formed 
an 
incentive 
to 
virtuous 
conduct 
in 
this 
life, 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
socialist 
promise 
is 
quite 
different. 
It 
imposes 
no 
other 
duty 
than 
that 
of 
giving 
political 
support 
to 
the 
party 
of 
socialism; 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
it 
raises 
expectations 
and 
demands. 


This 
being 
the 
character 
of 
the 
socialist 
dream, 
it 
is 
understandable 
that 
every 
one 
of 
the 
partisans 
of 
socialism 
expects 
from 
it 
precisely 
what 
has 
so 
far 
been 
denied 
to 
him. 
Socialist 
authors 
promise 
not 
only 
wealth 
for 
all, 
but 
also 
happiness 
in 
love 
for 
everybody, 
the 
full 
physical 
and 
spiritual 
development 
of 
each 
individual, 
the 
unfolding 
of 
great 
artistic 
and 
scientific 
talents 
in 
all 
men, 
etc. 
Only 
recently 
Trotsky 
stated 
in 
one 
of 
his 
writings 
that 
in 
the 
socialist 
society 
“the 
average 
human 
type 
will 
rise 
to 
the 
heights 
of 
an 
Aristotle, 
a 
Goethe, 
or 
a 
Marx. 
And 
above 
this 
ridge 
new 
peaks 
will 
rise.”[1] 
The 
socialist 
paradise 
will 
be 
the 
kingdom 
of 
perfection, 
populated 
by 
completely 
happy 
supermen. 
All 
socialist 
literature 
is 
full 
of 
such 
nonsense. 
But 
it 
is 
just 
this 
nonsense 
that 
wins 
it 
the 
most 
supporters. 


One 
cannot 
send 
every 
person 
suffering 
from 
a 
Fourier 
complex 
to 
the 
doctor 
for 
psychoanalytic 
treatment; 
the 
number 
of 
those 
afflicted 
with 
it 
is 
far 
too 
great. 
No 
other 
remedy 
is 
possible 
in 
this 
case 
than 
the 
treatment 
of 
the 
illness 
by 
the 
patient 
himself. 
Through 
self-knowledge 
he 
must 
learn 
to 
endure 
his 
lot 
in 
life 
without 
looking 
for 
a 
scapegoat 
on 
which 
he 
can 
lay 
all 
the 
blame, 
and 
he 
must 
endeavor 
to 
grasp 
the 
fundamental 
laws 
of 
social 
cooperation.

The 
Foundations 
of 
Liberal 
Policy 


1. 
Property 
Human 
society 
is 
an 
association 
of 
persons 
for 
cooperative 
action. 
As 
against 
the 
isolated 
action 
of 
individuals, 
cooperative 
action 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
has 
the 
advantage 
of 
greater 
productivity. 
If 
a 
number 
of 
men 
work 
in 
cooperation 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor, 
they 
will 
produce 
(other 
things 
being 
equal) 
not 
only 
as 
much 
as 
the 
sum 
of 
what 
they 
would 
have 
produced 
by 
working 
as 
self-sufficient 
individuals, 
but 
considerably 
more. 
All 
human 
civilization 
is 
founded 
on 
this 
fact. 
It 
is 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
that 
man 
is 
distinguished 
from 
the 
animals. 
It 
is 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
that 
has 
made 
feeble 
man, 
far 
inferior 
to 
most 
animals 
in 
physical 
strength, 
the 
lord 
of 
the 
earth 
and 
the 
creator 
of 
the 
marvels 
of 
technology. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor, 
we 
would 
not 
be 
in 
any 
respect 
further 
advanced 
today 
than 
our 
ancestors 
of 
a 
thousand 
or 
ten 
thousand 
years 
ago. 


Human 
labor 
by 
itself 
is 
not 
capable 
of 
increasing 
our 
well-being. 
In 
order 
to 
be 
fruitful, 
it 
must 
be 
applied 
to 
the 
materials 
and 
resources 
of 
the 
earth 
that 
Nature 
has 
placed 
at 
our 
disposal. 
Land, 
with 
all 
the 
substances 
and 
powers 
resident 
within 
it, 
and 
human 
labor 
constitute 
the 
two 
factors 
of 
production 
from 
whose 
purposeful 
cooperation 
proceed 
all 
the 
commodities 
that 
serve 
for 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
our 
outer 
needs. 
In 
order 
to 
produce, 
one 
must 
deploy 
labor 
and 
the 
material 
factors 
of 
production, 
including 
not 
only 
the 
raw 
materials 
and 
resources 
placed 
at 
our 
disposal 
by 
Nature 
and 
mostly 
found 
in 
the 
earth, 
but 
also 
the 
intermediate 
products 
already 
fabricated 
of 
these 
primary 
natural 
factors 
of 
production 
by 
previously 
performed 
human 
labor. 
In 
the 
language 
of 
economics 
we 
distinguish, 
accordingly, 
three 
factors 
of 
production: 
labor, 
land, 
and 
capital. 
By 
land 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
everything 
that 
Nature 
places 
at 
our 
disposal 
in 
the 
way 
of 
substances 
and 
powers 
on, 
under, 
and 
above 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
earth, 
in 
the 
water, 
and 
in 
the 
air; 
by 



capital 
goods, 
all 
the 
intermediate 
goods 
produced 
from 
land 
with 
the 
help 
of 
human 
labor 
that 
are 
made 
to 
serve 
further 
production, 
such 
as 
machines, 
tools, 
half-manufactured 
articles 
of 
all 
kinds, 
etc. 


Now 
we 
wish 
to 
consider 
two 
different 
systems 
of 
human 
cooperation 
under 
the 
division 
of 
labor—one 
based 
on 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
and 
the 
other 
based 
on 
communal 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
The 
latter 
is 
called 
socialism 
or 
communism; 
the 
former, 
liberalism 
or 
also 
(ever 
since 
it 
created 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
a 
division 
of 
labor 
encompassing 
the 
whole 
world) 
capitalism. 
The 
liberals 
maintain 
that 
the 
only 
workable 
system 
of 
human 
cooperation 
in 
a 
society 
based 
on 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
is 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
They 
contend 
that 
socialism 
as 
a 
completely 
comprehensive 
system 
encompassing 
all 
the 
means 
of 
production 
is 
unworkable 
and 
that 
the 
application 
of 
the 
socialist 
principle 
to 
a 
part 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
though 
not, 
of 
course, 
impossible, 
leads 
to 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
productivity 
of 
labor, 
so 
that, 
far 
from 
creating 
greater 
wealth, 
it 
must, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
have 
the 
effect 
of 
diminishing 
wealth. 


The 
program 
of 
liberalism, 
therefore, 
if 
condensed 
into 
a 
single 
word, 
would 
have 
to 
read: 
property, 
that 
is, 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
(for 
in 
regard 
to 
commodities 
ready 
for 
consumption, 
private 
ownership 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
course 
and 
is 
not 
disputed 
even 
by 
the 
socialists 
and 
communists). 
All 
the 
other 
demands 
of 
liberalism 
result 
from 
this 
fundamental 
demand. 


Side 
by 
side 
with 
the 
word 
“property” 
in 
the 
program 
of 
liberalism 
one 
may 
quite 
appropriately 
place 
the 
words 
“freedom” 
and 
“peace.” 
This 
is 
not 
because 
the 
older 
program 
of 
liberalism 
generally 
placed 
them 
there. 
We 
have 
already 
said 
that 
the 
program 
of 
present-day 
liberalism 
has 
outgrown 
that 
of 
the 
older 
liberalism, 
that 
it 
is 
based 
on 
a 
deeper 
and 
better 
insight 
into 
interrelationships, 
since 
it 
can 
reap 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
advances 
that 
science 
has 
made 
in 
the 
last 
decades. 
Freedom 
and 
peace 
have 
been 
placed 
in 
the 
forefront 
of 
the 
program 
of 
liberalism, 
not 
because 
many 
of 
the 
older 
liberals 
regarded 
them 
as 
coordinate 
with 
the 
fundamental 
principle 
of 
liberalism 
itself, 
rather 
than 
as 
merely 
a 
necessary 
consequence 
following 
from 
the 
one 
fundamental 
principle 
of 
the 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production; 
but 
solely 
because 
freedom 
and 
peace 
have 
come 
under 
especially 
violent 
attack 
from 
the 
opponents 
of 
liberalism, 
and 
liberals 
have 
not 
wanted 
to 
give 



the 
appearance, 
through 
the 
omission 
of 
these 
principles, 
that 
they 
in 
any 
way 
acknowledged 
the 
justness 
of 
the 
objections 
raised 
against 
them. 


2. 
Freedom 
The 
idea 
of 
freedom 
has 
become 
so 
ingrained 
in 
all 
of 
us 
that 
for 
a 
long 
time 
no 
one 
dared 
to 
call 
it 
into 
question. 
People 
were 
accustomed 
always 
to 
speaking 
of 
freedom 
only 
with 
the 
greatest 
of 
reverence; 
it 
remained 
for 
Lenin 
to 
call 
it 
a 
“bourgeois 
prejudice.” 
Although 
the 
fact 
is 
often 
forgotten 
today, 
all 
this 
is 
an 
achievement 
of 
liberalism. 
The 
very 
name 
of 
liberalism 
is 
derived 
from 
freedom, 
and 
the 
name 
of 
the 
party 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
liberals 
(both 
designations 
arose 
in 
the 
Spanish 
constitutional 
struggles 
of 
the 
first 
decades 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century) 
was 
originally 
the 
“servile.” 


Before 
the 
rise 
of 
liberalism 
even 
high-minded 
philosophers, 
founders 
of 
religions, 
clerics 
animated 
by 
the 
best 
of 
intentions, 
and 
statesmen 
who 
genuinely 
loved 
their 
people, 
viewed 
the 
thralldom 
of 
a 
part 
of 
the 
human 
race 
as 
a 
just, 
generally 
useful, 
and 
downright 
beneficial 
institution. 
Some 
men 
and 
peoples 
are, 
it 
was 
thought, 
destined 
by 
nature 
for 
freedom, 
and 
others 
for 
bondage. 
And 
it 
was 
not 
only 
the 
masters 
who 
thought 
so, 
but 
the 
greater 
number 
of 
the 
slaves 
as 
well. 
They 
put 
up 
with 
their 
servitude, 
not 
only 
because 
they 
had 
to 
yield 
to 
the 
superior 
force 
of 
the 
masters, 
but 
also 
because 
they 
found 
some 
good 
in 
it: 
the 
slave 
is 
relieved 
of 
concern 
for 
securing 
his 
daily 
bread, 
for 
the 
master 
is 
obliged 
to 
provide 
him 
with 
the 
necessities 
of 
life. 
When 
liberalism 
set 
out, 
in 
the 
eighteenth 
and 
the 
first 
half 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
to 
abolish 
the 
serfdom 
and 
subjection 
of 
the 
peasant 
population 
in 
Europe 
and 
the 
slavery 
of 
the 
Negroes 
in 
the 
overseas 
colonies, 
not 
a 
few 
sincere 
humanitarians 
declared 
themselves 
in 
opposition. 
Unfree 
laborers 
are 
used 
to 
their 
bondage 
and 
do 
not 
feel 
it 
as 
an 
evil. 
They 
are 
not 
ready 
for 
freedom 
and 
would 
not 
know 
how 
to 
make 
use 
of 
it. 
The 
discontinuation 
of 
the 
master’s 
care 
would 
be 
very 
harmful 
to 
them. 
They 
would 
not 
be 
capable 
of 
managing 
their 
affairs 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
always 
to 
provide 
more 
than 
just 
the 
bare 
necessities 
of 
life, 
and 
they 
would 
soon 
fall 
into 
want 
and 
misery. 
Emancipation 
would 
thus 
not 
only 
fail 
to 
gain 
for 
them 
anything 
of 
real 
value, 
but 
would 
seriously 
impair 
their 
material 
well-being. 


What 
was 
astonishing 
was 
that 
one 
could 
hear 
these 
views 
expressed 
even 
by 
many 
of 
the 
slaves 
whom 
one 
questioned. 
In 
order 
to 
counter 
such 



opinions, 
many 
liberals 
believed 
it 
necessary 
to 
represent 
as 
the 
general 
rule 
and 
even 
on 
occasion 
to 
depict 
in 
an 
exaggerated 
manner 
the 
exceptional 
cases 
in 
which 
serfs 
and 
slaves 
had 
been 
cruelly 
abused. 
But 
these 
excesses 
were 
by 
no 
means 
the 
rule. 
There 
were, 
of 
course, 
isolated 
instances 
of 
abuse, 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
were 
such 
cases 
was 
an 
additional 
reason 
for 
the 
abolition 
of 
this 
system. 
As 
a 
rule, 
however, 
the 
treatment 
of 
bondsmen 
by 
their 
masters 
was 
humane 
and 
mild. 


When 
those 
who 
recommended 
the 
abolition 
of 
involuntary 
servitude 
on 
general 
humanitarian 
grounds 
were 
told 
that 
the 
retention 
of 
the 
system 
was 
also 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
the 
enslaved, 
they 
knew 
of 
nothing 
to 
say 
in 
rejoinder. 
For 
against 
this 
objection 
in 
favor 
of 
slavery 
there 
is 
only 
one 
argument 
that 
can 
and 
did 
refute 
all 
others—namely, 
that 
free 
labor 
is 
incomparably 
more 
productive 
than 
slave 
labor. 
The 
slave 
has 
no 
interest 
in 
exerting 
himself 
fully. 
He 
works 
only 
as 
much 
and 
as 
zealously 
as 
is 
necessary 
to 
escape 
the 
punishment 
attaching 
to 
failure 
to 
perform 
the 
minimum. 
The 
free 
worker, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
knows 
that 
the 
more 
his 
labor 
accomplishes, 
the 
more 
he 
will 
be 
paid. 
He 
exerts 
himself 
to 
the 
full 
in 
order 
to 
raise 
his 
income. 
One 
has 
only 
to 
compare 
the 
demands 
placed 
on 
the 
worker 
by 
the 
tending 
of 
a 
modern 
tractor 
with 
the 
relatively 
small 
expenditure 
of 
intelligence, 
strength, 
and 
industry 
that 
just 
two 
generations 
ago 
was 
deemed 
sufficient 
for 
the 
enthralled 
ploughmen 
of 
Russia. 
Only 
free 
labor 
can 
accomplish 
what 
must 
be 
demanded 
of 
the 
modern 
industrial 
worker. 


Muddleheaded 
babblers 
may 
therefore 
argue 
interminably 
over 
whether 
all 
men 
are 
destined 
for 
freedom 
and 
are 
as 
yet 
ready 
for 
it. 
They 
may 
go 
on 
contending 
that 
there 
are 
races 
and 
peoples 
for 
whom 
Nature 
has 
prescribed 
a 
life 
of 
servitude 
and 
that 
the 
master 
races 
have 
the 
duty 
of 
keeping 
the 
rest 
of 
mankind 
in 
bondage. 
The 
liberal 
will 
not 
oppose 
their 
arguments 
in 
any 
way 
because 
his 
reasoning 
in 
favor 
of 
freedom 
for 
all, 
without 
distinction, 
is 
of 
an 
entirely 
different 
kind. 
We 
liberals 
do 
not 
assert 
that 
God 
or 
Nature 
meant 
all 
men 
to 
be 
free, 
because 
we 
are 
not 
instructed 
in 
the 
designs 
of 
God 
and 
of 
Nature, 
and 
we 
avoid, 
on 
principle, 
drawing 
God 
and 
Nature 
into 
a 
dispute 
over 
mundane 
questions. 
What 
we 
maintain 
is 
only 
that 
a 
system 
based 
on 
freedom 
for 
all 
workers 
warrants 
the 
greatest 
productivity 
of 
human 
labor 
and 
is 
therefore 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
all 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
earth. 
We 
attack 
involuntary 
servitude, 
not 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
is 
advantageous 
to 
the 
“masters,” 
but 
because 
we 
are 
convinced 
that, 
in 
the 
last 
analysis, 
it 
hurts 
the 



interests 
of 
all 
members 
of 
human 
society, 
including 
the 
“masters.” 
If 
mankind 
had 
adhered 
to 
the 
practice 
of 
keeping 
the 
whole 
or 
even 
a 
part 
of 
the 
labor 
force 
in 
bondage, 
the 
magnificent 
economic 
developments 
of 
the 
last 
hundred 
and 
fifty 
years 
would 
not 
have 
been 
possible. 
We 
would 
have 
no 
railroads, 
no 
automobiles, 
no 
airplanes, 
no 
steamships, 
no 
electric 
light 
and 
power, 
no 
chemical 
industry, 
just 
as 
the 
ancient 
Greeks 
and 
Romans, 
with 
all 
their 
genius, 
were 
without 
these 
things. 
It 
suffices 
merely 
to 
mention 
this 
for 
everyone 
to 
realize 
that 
even 
the 
former 
masters 
of 
slaves 
or 
serfs 
have 
every 
reason 
to 
be 
satisfied 
with 
the 
course 
of 
events 
after 
the 
abolition 
of 
involuntary 
servitude. 
The 
European 
worker 
today 
lives 
under 
more 
favorable 
and 
more 
agreeable 
outward 
circumstances 
than 
the 
pharaoh 
of 
Egypt 
once 
did, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
pharaoh 
commanded 
thousands 
of 
slaves, 
while 
the 
worker 
has 
nothing 
to 
depend 
on 
but 
the 
strength 
and 
skill 
of 
his 
hands. 
If 
a 
nabob 
of 
yore 
could 
.be 
placed 
in 
the 
circumstances 
in 
which 
a 
common 
man 
lives 
today, 
he 
would 
declare 
without 
hesitation 
that 
his 
life 
had 
been 
a 
beggarly 
one 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
life 
that 
even 
a 
man 
of 
moderate 
means 
can 
lead 
at 
present. 


This 
is 
the 
fruit 
of 
free 
labor. 
It 
is 
able 
to 
create 
more 
wealth 
for 
everyone 
than 
slave 
labor 
once 
provided 
for 
the 
masters. 


3. 
Peace 
There 
are 
high-minded 
men 
who 
detest 
war 
because 
it 
brings 
death 
and 
suffering. 
However 
much 
one 
may 
admire 
their 
humanitarianism, 
their 
argument 
against 
war, 
in 
being 
based 
on 
philanthropic 
grounds, 
seems 
to 
lose 
much 
or 
all 
of 
its 
force 
when 
we 
consider 
the 
statements 
of 
the 
supporters 
and 
proponents 
of 
war. 
The 
latter 
by 
no 
means 
deny 
that 
war 
brings 
with 
it 
pain 
and 
sorrow. 
Nevertheless, 
they 
believe 
it 
is 
through 
war 
and 
war 
alone 
that 
mankind 
is 
able 
to 
make 
progress. 
War 
is 
the 
father 
of 
all 
things, 
said 
a 
Greek 
philosopher, 
and 
thousands 
have 
repeated 
it 
after 
him. 
Man 
degenerates 
in 
time 
of 
peace. 
Only 
war 
awakens 
in 
him 
slumbering 
talents 
and 
powers 
and 
imbues 
him 
with 
sublime 
ideals. 
If 
war 
were 
to 
be 
abolished, 
mankind 
would 
decay 
into 
indolence 
and 
stagnation. 


It 
is 
difficult 
or 
even 
impossible 
to 
refute 
this 
line 
of 
reasoning 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
advocates 
of 
war 
if 
the 
only 
objection 
to 
war 
that 
one 
can 
think 
of 
is 
that 
it 
demands 
sacrifices. 
For 
the 
proponents 
of 
war 
are 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 



these 
sacrifices 
are 
not 
made 
in 
vain 
and 
that 
they 
are 
well 
worth 
making. 
If 
it 
were 
really 
true 
that 
war 
is 
the 
father 
of 
all 
things, 
then 
the 
human 
sacrifices 
it 
requires 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
further 
the 
general 
welfare 
and 
the 
progress 
of 
humanity. 
One 
might 
lament 
the 
sacrifices, 
one 
might 
even 
strive 
to 
reduce 
their 
number, 
but 
one 
would 
not 
be 
warranted 
in 
wanting 
to 
abolish 
war 
and 
to 
bring 
about 
eternal 
peace. 


The 
liberal 
critique 
of 
the 
argument 
in 
favor 
of 
war 
is 
fundamentally 
different 
from 
that 
of 
the 
humanitarians. 
It 
starts 
from 
the 
premise 
that 
not 
war, 
but 
peace, 
is 
the 
father 
of 
all 
things. 
What 
alone 
enables 
mankind 
to 
advance 
and 
distinguishes 
man 
from 
the 
animals 
is 
social 
cooperation. 
It 
is 
labor 
alone 
that 
is 
productive: 
it 
creates 
wealth 
and 
therewith 
lays 
the 
outward 
foundations 
for 
the 
inward 
flowering 
of 
man. 
War 
only 
destroys; 
it 
cannot 
create. 
War, 
carnage, 
destruction, 
and 
devastation 
we 
have 
in 
common 
with 
the 
predatory 
beasts 
of 
the 
jungle; 
constructive 
labor 
is 
our 
distinctively 
human 
characteristic. 
The 
liberal 
abhors 
war, 
not, 
like 
the 
humanitarian, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
has 
beneficial 
consequences, 
but 
because 
it 
has 
only 
harmful 
ones. 


The 
peace-loving 
humanitarian 
approaches 
the 
mighty 
potentate 
and 
addresses 
him 
thus: 
“Do 
not 
make 
war, 
even 
though 
you 
have 
the 
prospect 
of 
furthering 
your 
own 
welfare 
by 
a 
victory. 
Be 
noble 
and 
magnanimous 
and 
renounce 
the 
tempting 
victory 
even 
if 
it 
means 
a 
sacrifice 
for 
you 
and 
the 
loss 
of 
an 
advantage.” 
The 
liberal 
thinks 
otherwise. 
He 
is 
convinced 
that 
victorious 
war 
is 
an 
evil 
even 
for 
the 
victor, 
that 
peace 
is 
always 
better 
than 
war. 
He 
demands 
no 
sacrifice 
from 
the 
stronger, 
but 
only 
that 
he 
should 
come 
to 
realize 
where 
his 
true 
interests 
lie 
and 
should 
learn 
to 
understand 
that 
peace 
is 
for 
him, 
the 
stronger, 
just 
as 
advantageous 
as 
it 
is 
for 
the 
weaker. 


When 
a 
peace-loving 
nation 
is 
attacked 
by 
a 
bellicose 
enemy, 
it 
must 
offer 
resistance 
and 
do 
everything 
to 
ward 
off 
the 
onslaught. 
Heroic 
deeds 
performed 
in 
such 
a 
war 
by 
those 
fighting 
for 
their 
freedom 
and 
their 
lives 
are 
entirely 
praiseworthy, 
and 
one 
rightly 
extols 
the 
manliness 
and 
courage 
of 
such 
fighters. 
Here 
daring, 
intrepidity, 
and 
contempt 
for 
death 
are 
praiseworthy 
because 
they 
are 
in 
the 
service 
of 
a 
good 
end. 
But 
people 
have 
made 
the 
mistake 
of 
representing 
these 
soldierly 
virtues 
as 
absolute 
virtues, 
as 
qualities 
good 
in 
and 
for 
themselves, 
without 
consideration 
of 
the 
end 
they 
serve. 
Whoever 
holds 
this 
opinion 
must, 
to 
be 
consistent, 
likewise 
acknowledge 
as 
noble 
virtues 
the 
daring, 
intrepidity, 
and 
contempt 
for 
death 



of 
the 
robber. 
In 
fact, 
however, 
there 
is 
nothing 
good 
or 
bad 
in 
and 
of 
itself. 
Human 
actions 
become 
good 
or 
bad 
only 
through 
the 
end 
that 
they 
serve 
and 
the 
consequences 
they 
entail. 
Even 
Leonidas 
would 
not 
be 
worthy 
of 
the 
esteem 
in 
which 
we 
hold 
him 
if 
he 
had 
fallen, 
not 
as 
the 
defender 
of 
his 
homeland, 
but 
as 
the 
leader 
of 
an 
invading 
army 
intent 
on 
robbing 
a 
peaceful 
people 
of 
its 
freedom 
and 
possessions. 


How 
harmful 
war 
is 
to 
the 
development 
of 
human 
civilization 
becomes 
clearly 
apparent 
once 
one 
understands 
the 
advantages 
derived 
from 
the 
division 
of 
labor. 
The 
division 
of 
labor 
turns 
the 
self-sufficient 
individual 
into 
the 
ζῷον 
πολιτικόν 
dependent 
on 
his 
fellow 
men, 
the 
social 
animal 
of 
which 
Aristotle 
spoke. 
Hostilities 
between 
one 
animal 
and 
another, 
or 
between 
one 
savage 
and 
another, 
in 
no 
way 
alter 
the 
economic 
basis 
of 
their 
existence. 
The 
matter 
is 
quite 
different 
when 
a 
quarrel 
that 
has 
to 
be 
decided 
by 
an 
appeal 
to 
arms 
breaks 
out 
among 
the 
members 
of 
a 
community 
in 
which 
labor 
is 
divided. 
In 
such 
a 
society 
each 
individual 
has 
a 
specialized 
function; 
no 
one 
is 
any 
longer 
in 
a 
position 
to 
live 
independently, 
because 
all 
have 
need 
of 
one 
another’s 
aid 
and 
support. 
Self-sufficient 
farmers, 
who 
produce 
on 
their 
own 
farms 
everything 
that 
they 
and 
their 
families 
need, 
can 
make 
war 
on 
one 
another. 
But 
when 
a 
village 
divides 
into 
factions, 
with 
the 
smith 
on 
one 
side 
and 
the 
shoemaker 
on 
the 
other, 
one 
faction 
will 
have 
to 
suffer 
from 
want 
of 
shoes, 
and 
the 
other 
from 
want 
of 
tools 
and 
weapons. 
Civil 
war 
destroys 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
compels 
each 
group 
to 
content 
itself 
with 
the 
labor 
of 
its 
own 
adherents. 


If 
the 
possibility 
of 
such 
hostilities 
had 
been 
considered 
likely 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
would 
never 
have 
been 
allowed 
to 
develop 
to 
the 
point 
where, 
in 
case 
a 
fight 
really 
did 
break 
out, 
one 
would 
have 
to 
suffer 
privation. 
The 
progressive 
intensification 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
is 
possible 
only 
in 
a 
society 
in 
which 
there 
is 
an 
assurance 
of 
lasting 
peace. 
Only 
under 
the 
shelter 
of 
such 
security 
can 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
develop. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
this 
prerequisite, 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
does 
not 
extend 
beyond 
the 
limits 
of 
the 
village 
or 
even 
of 
the 
individual 
household. 
The 
division 
of 
labor 
between 
town 
and 
country—with 
the 
peasants 
of 
the 
surrounding 
villages 
furnishing 
grain, 
cattle, 
milk, 
and 
butter 
to 
the 
town 
in 
exchange 
for 
the 
manufactured 
products 
of 
the 
townsfolk—already 
presupposes 
that 
peace 
is 
assured 
at 
least 
within 
the 
region 
in 
question. 
If 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
is 
to 
embrace 
a 
whole 
nation, 
civil 
war 
must 
lie 
outside 
the 
realm 
of 
possibility; 
if 
it 
is 
to 
encompass 



the 
whole 
world, 
lasting 
peace 
among 
nations 
must 
be 
assured. 


Everyone 
today 
would 
regard 
it 
as 
utterly 
senseless 
for 
a 
modern 
metropolis 
like 
London 
or 
Berlin 
to 
prepare 
to 
make 
war 
on 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
adjacent 
countryside. 
Yet 
for 
many 
centuries 
the 
towns 
of 
Europe 
kept 
this 
possibility 
in 
mind 
and 
made 
economic 
provision 
for 
it. 
There 
were 
towns 
whose 
fortifications 
were, 
from 
the 
very 
beginning, 
so 
constructed 
that 
in 
case 
of 
need 
they 
could 
hold 
out 
for 
a 
while 
by 
keeping 
cattle 
and 
growing 
grain 
within 
the 
town 
walls. 


At 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
by 
far 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
inhabited 
world 
was 
still 
divided 
into 
a 
number 
of 
economic 
regions 
that 
were, 
by 
and 
large, 
self-sufficient. 
Even 
in 
the 
more 
highly 
developed 
areas 
of 
Europe, 
the 
needs 
of 
a 
region 
were 
met, 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
by 
the 
production 
of 
the 
region 
itself. 
Trade 
that 
went 
beyond 
the 
narrow 
confines 
of 
the 
immediate 
vicinity 
was 
relatively 
insignificant 
and 
comprised, 
by 
and 
large, 
only 
such 
commodities 
as 
could 
not 
be 
produced 
in 
the 
area 
itself 
because 
of 
climatic 
conditions. 
In 
by 
far 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
world, 
however, 
the 
production 
of 
the 
village 
itself 
supplied 
almost 
all 
the 
needs 
of 
its 
inhabitants. 
For 
these 
villagers, 
a 
disturbance 
in 
trade 
relations 
caused 
by 
war 
did 
not 
generally 
mean 
any 
impairment 
of 
their 
economic 
well-being. 
But 
even 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
more 
advanced 
countries 
of 
Europe 
did 
not 
suffer 
very 
severely 
in 
time 
of 
war. 
If 
the 
Continental 
System, 
which 
Napoleon 
I 
imposed 
on 
Europe 
in 
order 
to 
exclude 
from 
the 
continent 
English 
goods 
and 
those 
coming 
from 
across 
the 
ocean 
only 
by 
way 
of 
England, 
had 
been 
enforced 
even 
more 
rigorously 
than 
it 
was, 
it 
would 
have 
still 
inflicted 
on 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
continent 
hardly 
any 
appreciable 
privations. 
They 
would, 
of 
course, 
have 
had 
to 
do 
without 
coffee 
and 
sugar, 
cotton 
and 
cotton 
goods, 
spices, 
and 
many 
rare 
kinds 
of 
wood; 
but 
all 
these 
things 
then 
played 
only 
a 
subordinate 
role 
in 
the 
households 
of 
the 
great 
masses. 


The 
development 
of 
a 
complex 
network 
of 
international 
economic 
relations 
is 
a 
product 
of 
nineteenth-century 
liberalism 
and 
capitalism. 
They 
alone 
made 
possible 
the 
extensive 
specialization 
of 
modern 
production 
with 
its 
concomitant 
improvement 
in 
technology. 
In 
order 
to 
provide 
the 
family 
of 
an 
English 
worker 
with 
all 
it 
consumes 
and 
desires, 
every 
nation 
of 
the 
five 
continents 
cooperates. 
Tea 
for 
the 
breakfast 
table 
is 
provided 
by 
Japan 
or 
Ceylon, 
coffee 
by 
Brazil 
or 
Java, 
sugar 
by 
the 
West 
Indies, 
meat 
by 
Australia 



or 
Argentina, 
cotton 
from 
America 
or 
Egypt, 
hides 
for 
leather 
from 
India 
or 
Russia, 
and 
so 
on. 
And 
in 
exchange 
for 
these 
things, 
English 
goods 
go 
to 
all 
parts 
of 
the 
world, 
to 
the 
most 
remote 
and 
out-of-the-way 
villages 
and 
farmsteads. 
This 
development 
was 
possible 
and 
conceivable 
only 
because, 
with 
the 
triumph 
of 
liberal 
principles, 
people 
no 
longer 
took 
seriously 
the 
idea 
that 
a 
great 
war 
could 
ever 
again 
break 
out. 
In 
the 
golden 
age 
of 
liberalism, 
war 
among 
members 
of 
the 
white 
race 
was 
generally 
considered 
a 
thing 
of 
the 
past. 


But 
events 
have 
turned 
out 
quite 
differently. 
Liberal 
ideas 
and 
programs 
were 
supplanted 
by 
socialism, 
nationalism, 
protectionism, 
imperialism, 
etatism, 
and 
militarism. 
Whereas 
Kant 
and 
Von 
Humboldt, 
Bentham 
and 
Cobden 
had 
sung 
the 
praises 
of 
eternal 
peace, 
the 
spokesmen 
of 
a 
later 
age 
never 
tired 
of 
extolling 
war, 
both 
civil 
and 
international. 
And 
their 
success 
came 
only 
all 
too 
soon. 
The 
result 
was 
the 
World 
War, 
which 
has 
given 
our 
age 
a 
kind 
of 
object 
lesson 
on 
the 
incompatibility 
between 
war 
and 
the 
division 
of 
labor. 


4. 
Equality 
Nowhere 
is 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
reasoning 
of 
the 
older 
liberalism 
and 
that 
of 
neoliberalism 
clearer 
and 
easier 
to 
demonstrate 
than 
in 
their 
treatment 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
equality. 
The 
liberals 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
century, 
guided 
by 
the 
ideas 
of 
natural 
law 
and 
of 
the 
Enlightenment, 
demanded 
for 
everyone 
equality 
of 
political 
and 
civil 
rights 
because 
they 
assumed 
that 
all 
men 
are 
equal. 
God 
created 
all 
men 
equal, 
endowing 
them 
with 
fundamentally 
the 
same 
capabilities 
and 
talents, 
breathing 
into 
all 
of 
them 
the 
breath 
of 
His 
spirit. 
All 
distinctions 
between 
men 
are 
only 
artificial, 
the 
product 
of 
social, 
human—that 
is 
to 
say, 
transitory—institutions. 
What 
is 
imperishable 
in 
man—his 
spirit—is 
undoubtedly 
the 
same 
in 
rich 
and 
poor, 
noble 
and 
commoner, 
white 
and 
colored. 


Nothing, 
however, 
is 
as 
ill-founded 
as 
the 
assertion 
of 
the 
alleged 
equality 
of 
all 
members 
of 
the 
human 
race. 
Men 
are 
altogether 
unequal. 
Even 
between 
brothers 
there 
exist 
the 
most 
marked 
differences 
in 
physical 
and 
mental 
attributes. 
Nature 
never 
repeats 
itself 
in 
its 
creations; 
it 
produces 
nothing 
by 
the 
dozen, 
nor 
are 
its 
products 
standardized. 
Each 
man 
who 
leaves 
her 
workshop 
bears 
the 
imprint 
of 
the 
individual, 
the 
unique, 
the 
never-to



recur. 
Men 
are 
not 
equal, 
and 
the 
demand 
for 
equality 
under 
the 
law 
can 
by 
no 
means 
be 
grounded 
in 
the 
contention 
that 
equal 
treatment 
is 
due 
to 
equals. 


There 
are 
two 
distinct 
reasons 
why 
all 
men 
should 
receive 
equal 
treatment 
under 
the 
law. 
One 
was 
already 
mentioned 
when 
we 
analyzed 
the 
objections 
to 
involuntary 
servitude. 
In 
order 
for 
human 
labor 
to 
realize 
its 
highest 
attainable 
productivity, 
the 
worker 
must 
be 
free, 
because 
only 
the 
free 
worker, 
enjoying 
in 
the 
form 
of 
wages 
the 
fruits 
of 
his 
own 
industry, 
will 
exert 
himself 
to 
the 
full. 
The 
second 
consideration 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
equality 
of 
all 
men 
under 
the 
law 
is 
the 
maintenance 
of 
social 
peace. 
It 
has 
already 
been 
pointed 
out 
that 
every 
disturbance 
of 
the 
peaceful 
development 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
must 
be 
avoided. 
But 
it 
is 
well-nigh 
impossible 
to 
preserve 
lasting 
peace 
in 
a 
society 
in 
which 
the 
rights 
and 
duties 
of 
the 
respective 
classes 
are 
different. 
Whoever 
denies 
rights 
to 
a 
part 
of 
the 
population 
must 
always 
be 
prepared 
for 
a 
united 
attack 
by 
the 
disenfranchised 
on 
the 
privileged. 
Class 
privileges 
must 
disappear 
so 
that 
the 
conflict 
over 
them 
may 
cease. 


It 
is 
therefore 
quite 
unjustifiable 
to 
find 
fault 
with 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
liberalism 
put 
into 
effect 
its 
postulate 
of 
equality, 
on 
the 
ground 
that 
what 
it 
created 
was 
only 
equality 
before 
the 
law, 
and 
not 
real 
equality. 
All 
human 
power 
would 
be 
insufficient 
to 
make 
men 
really 
equal. 
Men 
are 
and 
will 
always 
remain 
unequal. 
It 
is 
sober 
considerations 
of 
utility 
such 
as 
those 
we 
have 
here 
presented 
that 
constitute 
the 
argument 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
equality 
of 
all 
men 
under 
the 
law. 
Liberalism 
never 
aimed 
at 
anything 
more 
than 
this, 
nor 
could 
it 
ask 
for 
anything 
more. 
It 
is 
beyond 
human 
power 
to 
make 
a 
Negro 
white. 
But 
the 
Negro 
can 
be 
granted 
the 
same 
rights 
as 
the 
white 
man 
and 
thereby 
offered 
the 
possibility 
of 
earning 
as 
much 
if 
he 
produces 
as 
much. 


But, 
the 
socialists 
say, 
it 
is 
not 
enough 
to 
make 
men 
equal 
before 
the 
law. 
In 
order 
to 
make 
them 
really 
equal, 
one 
must 
also 
allot 
them 
the 
same 
income. 
It 
is 
not 
enough 
to 
abolish 
privileges 
of 
birth 
and 
of 
rank. 
One 
must 
finish 
the 
job 
and 
do 
away 
with 
the 
greatest 
and 
most 
important 
privilege 
of 
all, 
namely, 
that 
which 
is 
accorded 
by 
private 
property. 
Only 
then 
will 
the 
liberal 
program 
be 
completely 
realized, 
and 
a 
consistent 
liberalism 
thus 
leads 
ultimately 
to 
socialism, 
to 
the 
abolition 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 


Privilege 
is 
an 
institutional 
arrangement 
favoring 
some 
individuals 
or 
a 
certain 
group 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
rest. 
The 
privilege 
exists, 
although 
it 



harms 
some—perhaps 
the 
majority—and 
benefits 
no 
one 
except 
those 
for 
whose 
advantage 
it 
was 
created. 
In 
the 
feudal 
order 
of 
the 
Middle 
Ages 
certain 
lords 
had 
the 
hereditary 
right 
to 
hold 
a 
judgeship. 
They 
were 
judges 
because 
they 
had 
inherited 
the 
position, 
regardless 
of 
whether 
they 
possessed 
the 
abilities 
and 
qualities 
of 
character 
that 
fit 
a 
man 
to 
be 
a 
judge. 
In 
their 
eyes 
this 
office 
was 
nothing 
more 
than 
a 
lucrative 
source 
of 
income. 
Here 
judgeship 
was 
the 
privilege 
of 
a 
class 
of 
noble 
birth. 


If, 
however, 
as 
in 
modern 
states, 
judges 
are 
always 
drawn 
from 
the 
circle 
of 
those 
with 
legal 
knowledge 
and 
experience, 
this 
does 
not 
constitute 
a 
privilege 
in 
favor 
of 
lawyers. 
Preference 
is 
given 
to 
lawyers, 
not 
for 
their 
sake, 
but 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
the 
public 
welfare, 
because 
people 
are 
generally 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
a 
knowledge 
of 
jurisprudence 
is 
an 
indispensable 
prerequisite 
for 
holding 
a 
judgeship. 
The 
question 
whether 
a 
certain 
institutional 
arrangement 
is 
or 
is 
not 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
privilege 
granted 
to 
a 
certain 
group, 
class, 
or 
person 
is 
not 
to 
be 
decided 
by 
whether 
or 
not 
it 
is 
advantageous 
to 
that 
group, 
class, 
or 
person, 
but 
according 
to 
how 
beneficial 
to 
the 
general 
public 
it 
is 
considered 
to 
be. 
The 
fact 
that 
on 
a 
ship 
at 
sea 
one 
man 
is 
captain 
and 
the 
rest 
constitute 
his 
crew 
and 
are 
subject 
to 
his 
command 
is 
certainly 
an 
advantage 
for 
the 
captain. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
is 
not 
a 
privilege 
of 
the 
captain 
if 
he 
possesses 
the 
ability 
to 
steer 
the 
ship 
between 
reefs 
in 
a 
storm 
and 
thereby 
to 
be 
of 
service 
not 
only 
to 
himself, 
but 
to 
the 
whole 
crew. 


In 
order 
to 
determine 
whether 
an 
institutional 
arrangement 
is 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
the 
special 
privilege 
of 
an 
individual 
or 
of 
a 
class, 
the 
question 
one 
should 
ask 
is 
not 
whether 
it 
benefits 
this 
or 
that 
individual 
or 
class, 
but 
only 
whether 
it 
is 
beneficial 
to 
the 
general 
public. 
If 
we 
reach 
the 
conclusion 
that 
only 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
makes 
possible 
the 
prosperous 
development 
of 
human 
society, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
this 
is 
tantamount 
to 
saying 
that 
private 
property 
is 
not 
a 
privilege 
of 
the 
property 
owner, 
but 
a 
social 
institution 
for 
the 
good 
and 
benefit 
of 
all, 
even 
though 
it 
may 
at 
the 
same 
time 
be 
especially 
agreeable 
and 
advantageous 
to 
some. 


It 
is 
not 
on 
behalf 
of 
property 
owners 
that 
liberalism 
favors 
the 
preservation 
of 
the 
institution 
of 
private 
property. 
It 
is 
not 
because 
the 
abolition 
of 
that 
institution 
would 
violate 
property 
rights 
that 
the 
liberals 
want 
to 
preserve 
it. 
If 
they 
considered 
the 
abolition 
of 
the 
institution 
of 
private 
property 
to 
be 
in 
the 
general 
interest, 
they 
would 
advocate 
that 
it 
be 



abolished, 
no 
matter 
how 
prejudicial 
such 
a 
policy 
might 
be 
to 
the 
interests 
of 
property 
owners. 
However, 
the 
preservation 
of 
that 
institution 
is 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
all 
strata 
of 
society. 
Even 
the 
poor 
man, 
who 
can 
call 
nothing 
his 
own, 
lives 
incomparably 
better 
in 
our 
society 
than 
he 
would 
in 
one 
that 
would 
prove 
incapable 
of 
producing 
even 
a 
fraction 
of 
what 
is 
produced 
in 
our 
own. 


5. 
The 
Inequality 
of 
Wealth 
and 
Income 
What 
is 
most 
criticized 
in 
our 
social 
order 
is 
the 
inequality 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
wealth 
and 
income. 
There 
are 
rich 
and 
poor; 
there 
are 
very 
rich 
and 
very 
poor. 
The 
way 
out 
is 
not 
far 
to 
seek: 
the 
equal 
distribution 
of 
all 
wealth. 


The 
first 
objection 
to 
this 
proposal 
is 
that 
it 
will 
not 
help 
the 
situation 
much 
because 
those 
of 
moderate 
means 
far 
outnumber 
the 
rich, 
so 
that 
each 
individual 
could 
expect 
from 
such 
a 
distribution 
only 
a 
quite 
insignificant 
increment 
in 
his 
standard 
of 
living. 
This 
is 
certainly 
correct, 
but 
the 
argument 
is 
not 
complete. 
Those 
who 
advocate 
equality 
of 
income 
distribution 
overlook 
the 
most 
important 
point, 
namely, 
that 
the 
total 
available 
for 
distribution, 
the 
annual 
product 
of 
social 
labor, 
is 
not 
independent 
of 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
it 
is 
divided. 
The 
fact 
that 
that 
product 
today 
is 
as 
great 
as 
it 
is, 
is 
not 
a 
natural 
or 
technological 
phenomenon 
independent 
of 
all 
social 
conditions, 
but 
entirely 
the 
result 
of 
our 
social 
institutions. 
Only 
because 
inequality 
of 
wealth 
is 
possible 
in 
our 
social 
order, 
only 
because 
it 
stimulates 
everyone 
to 
produce 
as 
much 
as 
he 
can 
and 
at 
the 
lowest 
cost, 
does 
mankind 
today 
have 
at 
its 
disposal 
the 
total 
annual 
wealth 
now 
available 
for 
consumption. 
Were 
this 
incentive 
to 
be 
destroyed, 
productivity 
would 
be 
so 
greatly 
reduced 
that 
the 
portion 
that 
an 
equal 
distribution 
would 
allot 
to 
each 
individual 
would 
be 
far 
less 
than 
what 
even 
the 
poorest 
receives 
today. 


The 
inequality 
of 
income 
distribution 
has, 
however, 
still 
a 
second 
function 
quite 
as 
important 
as 
the 
one 
already 
mentioned: 
it 
makes 
possible 
the 
luxury 
of 
the 
rich. 


Many 
foolish 
things 
have 
been 
said 
and 
written 
about 
luxury. 
Against 
luxury 
consumption 
it 
has 
been 
objected 
that 
it 
is 
unjust 
that 
some 
should 
enjoy 
great 
abundance 
while 
others 
are 
in 
want. 
This 
argument 
seems 
to 
have 
some 
merit. 
But 
it 
only 
seems 
so. 
For 
if 
it 
can 
be 
shown 
that 
luxury 



consumption 
performs 
a 
useful 
function 
in 
the 
system 
of 
social 
cooperation, 
then 
the 
argument 
will 
be 
proved 
invalid. 
This, 
however, 
is 
what 
we 
shall 
seek 
to 
demonstrate. 


Our 
defense 
of 
luxury 
consumption 
is 
not, 
of 
course, 
the 
argument 
that 
one 
occasionally 
hears, 
that 
is, 
that 
it 
spreads 
money 
among 
the 
people. 
If 
the 
rich 
did 
not 
indulge 
themselves 
in 
luxuries, 
it 
is 
said, 
the 
poor 
would 
have 
no 
income. 
This 
is 
simply 
nonsense. 
For 
if 
there 
were 
no 
luxury 
consumption, 
the 
capital 
and 
labor 
that 
would 
otherwise 
have 
been 
applied 
to 
the 
production 
of 
luxury 
goods 
would 
produce 
other 
goods: 
articles 
of 
mass 
consumption, 
necessary 
articles, 
instead 
of 
“superfluous” 
ones. 


To 
form 
a 
correct 
conception 
of 
the 
social 
significance 
of 
luxury 
consumption, 
one 
must 
first 
of 
all 
realize 
that 
the 
concept 
of 
luxury 
is 
an 
altogether 
relative 
one. 
Luxury 
consists 
in 
a 
way 
of 
living 
that 
stands 
in 
sharp 
contrast 
to 
that 
of 
the 
great 
mass 
of 
one’s 
contemporaries. 
The 
conception 
of 
luxury 
is, 
therefore, 
essentially 
historical. 
Many 
things 
that 
seem 
to 
us 
necessities 
today 
were 
once 
considered 
as 
luxuries. 
When, 
in 
the 
Middle 
Ages, 
an 
aristocratic 
Byzantine 
lady 
who 
had 
married 
a 
Venetian 
doge 
made 
use 
of 
a 
golden 
implement, 
which 
could 
be 
called 
the 
forerunner 
of 
the 
fork 
as 
we 
know 
it 
today, 
instead 
of 
her 
fingers, 
in 
eating 
her 
meals, 
the 
Venetians 
looked 
on 
this 
as 
a 
godless 
luxury, 
and 
they 
thought 
it 
only 
just 
when 
the 
lady 
was 
stricken 
with 
a 
dreadful 
disease; 
this 
must 
be, 
they 
supposed, 
the 
well-
merited 
punishment 
of 
God 
for 
such 
unnatural 
extravagance. 
Two 
or 
three 
generations 
ago 
even 
in 
England 
an 
indoor 
bathroom 
was 
considered 
a 
luxury; 
today 
the 
home 
of 
every 
English 
worker 
of 
the 
better 
type 
contains 
one. 
Thirty-five 
years 
ago 
there 
were 
no 
automobiles; 
twenty 
years 
ago 
the 
possession 
of 
such 
a 
vehicle 
was 
the 
sign 
of 
a 
particularly 
luxurious 
mode 
of 
living; 
today 
in 
the 
United 
States 
even 
the 
worker 
has 
his 
Ford. 
This 
is 
the 
course 
of 
economic 
history. 
The 
luxury 
of 
today 
is 
the 
necessity 
of 
tomorrow. 
Every 
advance 
first 
comes 
into 
being 
as 
the 
luxury 
of 
a 
few 
rich 
people, 
only 
to 
become, 
after 
a 
time, 
the 
indispensable 
necessity 
taken 
for 
granted 
by 
everyone. 
Luxury 
consumption 
provides 
industry 
with 
the 
stimulus 
to 
discover 
and 
introduce 
new 
things. 
It 
is 
one 
of 
the 
dynamic 
factors 
in 
our 
economy. 
To 
it 
we 
owe 
the 
progressive 
innovations 
by 
which 
the 
standard 
of 
living 
of 
all 
strata 
of 
the 
population 
has 
been 
gradually 
raised. 


Most 
of 
us 
have 
no 
sympathy 
with 
the 
rich 
idler 
who 
spends 
his 
life 
in 
pleasure 
without 
ever 
doing 
any 
work. 
But 
even 
he 
fulfills 
a 
function 
in 
the 



life 
of 
the 
social 
organism. 
He 
sets 
an 
example 
of 
luxury 
that 
awakens 
in 
the 
multitude 
a 
consciousness 
of 
new 
needs 
and 
gives 
industry 
the 
incentive 
to 
fulfill 
them. 
There 
was 
a 
time 
when 
only 
the 
rich 
could 
afford 
the 
luxury 
of 
visiting 
foreign 
countries. 
Schiller 
never 
saw 
the 
Swiss 
mountains, 
which 
he 
celebrated 
in 
Wilhelm 
Tell, 
although 
they 
bordered 
on 
his 
Swabian 
homeland. 
Goethe 
saw 
neither 
Paris 
nor 
Vienna 
nor 
London. 
Today, 
however, 
hundreds 
of 
thousands 
travel, 
and 
soon 
millions 
will 
do 
so. 


6. 
Private 
Property 
and 
Ethics 
In 
seeking 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
social 
function 
and 
necessity 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
and 
of 
the 
concomitant 
inequality 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
income 
and 
wealth, 
we 
are 
at 
the 
same 
time 
providing 
proof 
of 
the 
moral 
justification 
for 
private 
property 
and 
for 
the 
capitalist 
social 
order 
based 
upon 
it. 


Morality 
consists 
in 
the 
regard 
for 
the 
necessary 
requirements 
of 
social 
existence 
that 
must 
be 
demanded 
of 
each 
individual 
member 
of 
society. 
A 
man 
living 
in 
isolation 
has 
no 
moral 
rules 
to 
follow. 
He 
need 
have 
no 
qualms 
about 
doing 
anything 
he 
finds 
it 
to 
his 
advantage 
to 
do, 
for 
he 
does 
not 
have 
to 
consider 
whether 
he 
is 
not 
thereby 
injuring 
others. 
But 
as 
a 
member 
of 
society, 
a 
man 
must 
take 
into 
consideration, 
in 
everything 
he 
does, 
not 
only 
his 
own 
immediate 
advantage, 
but 
also 
the 
necessity, 
in 
every 
action, 
of 
affirming 
society 
as 
such. 
For 
the 
life 
of 
the 
individual 
in 
society 
is 
possible 
only 
by 
virtue 
of 
social 
cooperation, 
and 
every 
individual 
would 
be 
most 
seriously 
harmed 
if 
the 
social 
organization 
of 
life 
and 
of 
production 
were 
to 
break 
down. 
In 
requiring 
of 
the 
individual 
that 
he 
should 
take 
society 
into 
consideration 
in 
all 
his 
actions, 
that 
he 
should 
forgo 
an 
action 
that, 
while 
advantageous 
to 
him, 
would 
be 
detrimental 
to 
social 
life, 
society 
does 
not 
demand 
that 
he 
sacrifice 
himself 
to 
the 
interests 
of 
others. 
For 
the 
sacrifice 
that 
it 
imposes 
is 
only 
a 
provisional 
one: 
the 
renunciation 
of 
an 
immediate 
and 
relatively 
minor 
advantage 
in 
exchange 
for 
a 
much 
greater 
ultimate 
benefit. 
The 
continued 
existence 
of 
society 
as 
the 
association 
of 
persons 
working 
in 
cooperation 
and 
sharing 
a 
common 
way 
of 
life 
is 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
every 
individual. 
Whoever 
gives 
up 
a 
momentary 
advantage 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
imperiling 
the 
continued 
existence 
of 
society 
is 
sacrificing 
a 
lesser 
gain 
for 
a 
greater 
one. 



The 
meaning 
of 
this 
regard 
for 
the 
general 
social 
interest 
has 
frequently 
been 
misunderstood. 
Its 
moral 
value 
was 
believed 
to 
consist 
in 
the 
fact 
of 
the 
sacrifice 
itself, 
in 
the 
renunciation 
of 
an 
immediate 
gratification. 
One 
refused 
to 
see 
that 
what 
is 
morally 
valuable 
is 
not 
the 
sacrifice, 
but 
the 
end 
served 
by 
the 
sacrifice, 
and 
one 
insisted 
on 
ascribing 
moral 
value 
to 
sacrifice, 
to 
renunciation, 
in 
and 
for 
itself 
alone. 
But 
sacrificing 
is 
moral 
only 
when 
it 
serves 
a 
moral 
end. 
There 
is 
a 
world 
of 
difference 
between 
a 
man 
who 
risks 
his 
life 
and 
property 
for 
a 
good 
cause 
and 
the 
man 
who 
sacrifices 
them 
without 
benefiting 
society 
in 
any 
way. 


Everything 
that 
serves 
to 
preserve 
the 
social 
order 
is 
moral; 
everything 
that 
is 
detrimental 
to 
it 
is 
immoral. 
Accordingly, 
when 
we 
reach 
the 
conclusion 
that 
an 
institution 
is 
beneficial 
to 
society, 
one 
can 
no 
longer 
object 
that 
it 
is 
immoral. 
There 
may 
possibly 
be 
a 
difference 
of 
opinion 
about 
whether 
a 
particular 
institution 
is 
socially 
beneficial 
or 
harmful. 
But 
once 
it 
has 
been 
judged 
beneficial, 
one 
can 
no 
longer 
contend 
that, 
for 
some 
inexplicable 
reason, 
it 
must 
be 
condemned 
as 
immoral. 


7. 
State 
and 
Government 
The 
observance 
of 
the 
moral 
law 
is 
in 
the 
ultimate 
interest 
of 
every 
individual, 
because 
everyone 
benefits 
from 
the 
preservation 
of 
social 
cooperation; 
yet 
it 
imposes 
on 
everyone 
a 
sacrifice, 
even 
though 
only 
a 
provisional 
one 
that 
is 
more 
than 
counterbalanced 
by 
a 
greater 
gain. 
To 
perceive 
this, 
however, 
requires 
a 
certain 
insight 
into 
the 
connection 
between 
things, 
and 
to 
conform 
one’s 
actions 
in 
accordance 
with 
this 
perception 
demands 
a 
certain 
strength 
of 
will. 
Those 
who 
lack 
the 
perception, 
or, 
having 
the 
perception, 
lack 
the 
necessary 
will 
power 
to 
put 
it 
to 
use, 
are 
not 
able 
to 
conform 
to 
the 
moral 
law 
voluntarily. 
The 
situation 
here 
is 
no 
different 
from 
that 
involved 
in 
the 
observance 
of 
the 
rules 
of 
hygiene 
that 
the 
individual 
ought 
to 
follow 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
his 
own 
well-being. 
Someone 
may 
give 
himself 
over 
to 
unwholesome 
dissipation, 
such 
as 
indulgence 
in 
narcotics, 
whether 
because 
he 
does 
not 
know 
the 
consequences, 
or 
because 
he 
considers 
them 
less 
disadvantageous 
than 
the 
renunciation 
of 
the 
momentary 
pleasure, 
or 
because 
he 
lacks 
the 
requisite 
will 
power 
to 
adjust 
his 
behavior 
to 
his 
knowledge. 
There 
are 
people 
who 
consider 
that 
society 
is 
justified 
in 
resorting 
to 
coercive 
measures 
to 
set 
such 
a 
person 
on 
the 
right 
path 
and 
to 



correct 
anyone 
whose 
heedless 
actions 
imperil 
his 
own 
life 
and 
health. 
They 
advocate 
that 
alcoholics 
and 
drug 
addicts 
be 
forcibly 
deterred 
from 
indulging 
their 
vices 
and 
compelled 
to 
protect 
their 
good 
health. 


The 
question 
whether 
compulsion 
really 
answers 
the 
purpose 
in 
such 
cases 
we 
shall 
reserve 
for 
later 
consideration. 
What 
concerns 
us 
here 
is 
something 
quite 
different, 
namely, 
the 
question 
whether 
people 
whose 
actions 
endanger 
the 
continued 
existence 
of 
society 
should 
be 
compelled 
to 
refrain 
from 
doing 
so. 
The 
alcoholic 
and 
the 
drug 
addict 
harm 
only 
themselves 
by 
their 
behavior; 
the 
person 
who 
violates 
the 
rules 
of 
morality 
governing 
man’s 
life 
in 
society 
harms 
not 
only 
himself, 
but 
everyone. 
Life 
in 
society 
would 
be 
quite 
impossible 
if 
the 
people 
who 
desire 
its 
continued 
existence 
and 
who 
conduct 
themselves 
accordingly 
had 
to 
forgo 
the 
use 
of 
force 
and 
compulsion 
against 
those 
who 
are 
prepared 
to 
undermine 
society 
by 
their 
behavior. 
A 
small 
number 
of 
antisocial 
individuals, 
i.e., 
persons 
who 
are 
not 
willing 
or 
able 
to 
make 
the 
temporary 
sacrifices 
that 
society 
demands 
of 
them, 
could 
make 
all 
society 
impossible. 
Without 
the 
application 
of 
compulsion 
and 
coercion 
against 
the 
enemies 
of 
society, 
there 
could 
not 
be 
any 
life 
in 
society. 


We 
call 
the 
social 
apparatus 
of 
compulsion 
and 
coercion 
that 
induces 
people 
to 
abide 
by 
the 
rules 
of 
life 
in 
society, 
the 
state; 
the 
rules 
according 
to 
which 
the 
state 
proceeds, 
law; 
and 
the 
organs 
charged 
with 
the 
responsibility 
of 
administering 
the 
apparatus 
of 
compulsion, 
government. 


There 
is, 
to 
be 
sure, 
a 
sect 
that 
believes 
that 
one 
could 
quite 
safely 
dispense 
with 
every 
form 
of 
compulsion 
and 
base 
society 
entirely 
on 
the 
voluntary 
observance 
of 
the 
moral 
code. 
The 
anarchists 
consider 
state, 
law, 
and 
government 
as 
superfluous 
institutions 
in 
a 
social 
order 
that 
would 
really 
serve 
the 
good 
of 
all, 
and 
not 
just 
the 
special 
interests 
of 
a 
privileged 
few. 
Only 
because 
the 
present 
social 
order 
is 
based 
on 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
is 
it 
necessary 
to 
resort 
to 
compulsion 
and 
coercion 
in 
its 
defense. 
If 
private 
property 
were 
abolished, 
then 
everyone, 
without 
exception, 
would 
spontaneously 
observe 
the 
rules 
demanded 
by 
social 
cooperation. 


It 
has 
already 
been 
pointed 
out 
that 
this 
doctrine 
is 
mistaken 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
concerns 
the 
character 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
But 
even 
apart 
from 
this, 
it 
is 
altogether 
untenable. 
The 
anarchist, 
rightly 
enough, 
does 
not 
deny 
that 
every 
form 
of 
human 
cooperation 
in 
a 
society 
based 
on 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
demands 
the 
observance 
of 
some 
rules 
of 



conduct 
that 
are 
not 
always 
agreeable 
to 
the 
individual, 
since 
they 
impose 
on 
him 
a 
sacrifice, 
only 
temporary, 
it 
is 
true, 
but, 
for 
all 
that, 
at 
least 
for 
the 
moment, 
painful. 
But 
the 
anarchist 
is 
mistaken 
in 
assuming 
that 
everyone, 
without 
exception, 
will 
be 
willing 
to 
observe 
these 
rules 
voluntarily. 
There 
are 
dyspeptics 
who, 
though 
they 
know 
very 
well 
that 
indulgence 
in 
a 
certain 
food 
will, 
after 
a 
short 
time, 
cause 
them 
severe, 
even 
scarcely 
bearable 
pains, 
are 
nevertheless 
unable 
to 
forgo 
the 
enjoyment 
of 
the 
delectable 
dish. 
Now 
the 
interrelationships 
of 
life 
in 
society 
are 
not 
as 
easy 
to 
trace 
as 
the 
physiological 
effects 
of 
a 
food, 
nor 
do 
the 
consequences 
follow 
so 
quickly 
and, 
above 
all, 
so 
palpably 
for 
the 
evildoer. 
Can 
it, 
then, 
be 
assumed, 
without 
falling 
completely 
into 
absurdity, 
that, 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
this, 
every 
individual 
in 
an 
anarchist 
society 
will 
have 
greater 
foresight 
and 
will 
power 
than 
a 
gluttonous 
dyspeptic? 
In 
an 
anarchist 
society 
is 
the 
possibility 
entirely 
to 
be 
excluded 
that 
someone 
may 
negligently 
throw 
away 
a 
lighted 
match 
and 
start 
a 
fire 
or, 
in 
a 
fit 
of 
anger, 
jealousy, 
or 
revenge, 
inflict 
injury 
on 
his 
fellow 
man? 
Anarchism 
misunderstands 
the 
real 
nature 
of 
man. 
It 
would 
be 
practicable 
only 
in 
a 
world 
of 
angels 
and 
saints. 


Liberalism 
is 
not 
anarchism, 
nor 
has 
it 
anything 
whatsoever 
to 
do 
with 
anarchism. 
The 
liberal 
understands 
quite 
clearly 
that 
without 
resort 
to 
compulsion, 
the 
existence 
of 
society 
would 
be 
endangered 
and 
that 
behind 
the 
rules 
of 
conduct 
whose 
observance 
is 
necessary 
to 
assure 
peaceful 
human 
cooperation 
must 
stand 
the 
threat 
of 
force 
if 
the 
whole 
edifice 
of 
society 
is 
not 
to 
be 
continually 
at 
the 
mercy 
of 
any 
one 
of 
its 
members. 
One 
must 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
compel 
the 
person 
who 
will 
not 
respect 
the 
lives, 
health, 
personal 
freedom, 
or 
private 
property 
of 
others 
to 
acquiesce 
in 
the 
rules 
of 
life 
in 
society. 
This 
is 
the 
function 
that 
the 
liberal 
doctrine 
assigns 
to 
the 
state: 
the 
protection 
of 
property, 
liberty, 
and 
peace. 


The 
German 
socialist, 
Ferdinand 
Lassalle, 
tried 
to 
make 
the 
conception 
of 
a 
government 
limited 
exclusively 
to 
this 
sphere 
appear 
ridiculous 
by 
calling 
the 
state 
constituted 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
liberal 
principles 
the 
“nightwatchman 
state.” 
But 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
see 
why 
the 
night-watchman 
state 
should 
be 
any 
more 
ridiculous 
or 
worse 
than 
the 
state 
that 
concerns 
itself 
with 
the 
preparation 
of 
sauerkraut, 
with 
the 
manufacture 
of 
trouser 
buttons, 
or 
with 
the 
publication 
of 
newspapers. 
In 
order 
to 
understand 
the 
impression 
that 
Lassalle 
was 
seeking 
to 
create 
with 
this 
witticism, 
one 
must 
keep 
in 
mind 
that 
the 
Germans 
of 
his 
time 
had 
not 
yet 
forgotten 
the 
state 
of 
the 
monarchical 



despots, 
with 
its 
vast 
multiplicity 
of 
administrative 
and 
regulatory 
functions, 
and 
that 
they 
were 
still 
very 
much 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
philosophy 
of 
Hegel, 
which 
had 
elevated 
the 
state 
to 
the 
position 
of 
a 
divine 
entity. 
If 
one 
looked 
upon 
the 
state, 
with 
Hegel, 
as 
“the 
self-conscious 
moral 
substance,” 
as 
the 
“Universal 
in 
and 
for 
itself, 
the 
rationality 
of 
the 
will,” 
then, 
of 
course, 
one 
had 
to 
view 
as 
blasphemous 
any 
attempt 
to 
limit 
the 
function 
of 
the 
state 
to 
that 
of 
serving 
as 
a 
night 
watchman. 


It 
is 
only 
thus 
that 
one 
can 
understand 
how 
it 
was 
possible 
for 
people 
to 
go 
so 
far 
as 
to 
reproach 
liberalism 
for 
its 
“hostility” 
or 
enmity 
towards 
the 
state. 
If 
I 
am 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
it 
is 
inexpedient 
to 
assign 
to 
the 
government 
the 
task 
of 
operating 
railroads, 
hotels, 
or 
mines, 
I 
am 
not 
an 
“enemy 
of 
the 
state” 
any 
more 
than 
I 
can 
be 
called 
an 
enemy 
of 
sulfuric 
acid 
because 
I 
am 
of 
the 
opinion 
that, 
useful 
though 
it 
may 
be 
for 
many 
purposes, 
it 
is 
not 
suitable 
either 
for 
drinking 
or 
for 
washing 
one’s 
hands. 


It 
is 
incorrect 
to 
represent 
the 
attitude 
of 
liberalism 
toward 
the 
state 
by 
saying 
that 
it 
wishes 
to 
restrict 
the 
latter’s 
sphere 
of 
possible 
activity 
or 
that 
it 
abhors, 
in 
principle, 
all 
activity 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
state 
in 
relation 
to 
economic 
life. 
Such 
an 
interpretation 
is 
altogether 
out 
of 
the 
question. 
The 
stand 
that 
liberalism 
takes 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
function 
of 
the 
state 
is 
the 
necessary 
consequence 
of 
its 
advocacy 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
If 
one 
is 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
latter, 
one 
cannot, 
of 
course, 
also 
be 
in 
favor 
of 
communal 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
i.e., 
of 
placing 
them 
at 
the 
disposition 
of 
the 
government 
rather 
than 
of 
individual 
owners. 
Thus, 
the 
advocacy 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
already 
implies 
a 
very 
severe 
circumscription 
of 
the 
functions 
assigned 
to 
the 
state. 


The 
socialists 
are 
sometimes 
wont 
to 
reproach 
liberalism 
with 
a 
lack 
of 
consistency. 
It 
is, 
they 
maintain, 
illogical 
to 
restrict 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
state 
in 
the 
economic 
sphere 
exclusively 
to 
the 
protection 
of 
property. 
It 
is 
difficult 
to 
see 
why, 
if 
the 
state 
is 
not 
to 
remain 
completely 
neutral, 
its 
intervention 
has 
to 
be 
limited 
to 
protecting 
the 
rights 
of 
property 
owners. 


This 
reproach 
would 
be 
justified 
only 
if 
the 
opposition 
of 
liberalism 
to 
all 
governmental 
activity 
in 
the 
economic 
sphere 
going 
beyond 
the 
protection 
of 
property 
stemmed 
from 
an 
aversion 
in 
principle 
against 
any 
activity 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
state. 
But 
that 
is 
by 
no 
means 
the 
case. 
The 
reason 
why 
liberalism 
opposes 
a 
further 
extension 
of 
the 
sphere 
of 
governmental 
activity 
is 
precisely 
that 
this 
would, 
in 
effect, 
abolish 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 



production. 
And 
in 
private 
property 
the 
liberal 
sees 
the 
principle 
most 
suitable 
for 
the 
organization 
of 
man’s 
life 
in 
society. 


8. 
Democracy 
Liberalism 
is 
therefore 
far 
from 
disputing 
the 
necessity 
of 
a 
machinery 
of 
state, 
a 
system 
of 
law, 
and 
a 
government. 
It 
is 
a 
grave 
misunderstanding 
to 
associate 
it 
in 
any 
way 
with 
the 
idea 
of 
anarchism. 
For 
the 
liberal, 
the 
state 
is 
an 
absolute 
necessity, 
since 
the 
most 
important 
tasks 
are 
incumbent 
upon 
it: 
the 
protection 
not 
only 
of 
private 
property, 
but 
also 
of 
peace, 
for 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
the 
latter 
the 
full 
benefits 
of 
private 
property 
cannot 
be 
reaped. 


These 
considerations 
alone 
suffice 
to 
determine 
the 
conditions 
that 
a 
state 
must 
fulfill 
in 
order 
to 
correspond 
to 
the 
liberal 
ideal. 
It 
must 
not 
only 
be 
able 
to 
protect 
private 
property; 
it 
must 
also 
be 
so 
constituted 
that 
the 
smooth 
and 
peaceful 
course 
of 
its 
development 
is 
never 
interrupted 
by 
civil 
wars, 
revolutions, 
or 
insurrections. 


Many 
people 
are 
still 
haunted 
by 
the 
idea, 
which 
dates 
back 
to 
the 
preliberal 
era, 
that 
a 
certain 
nobility 
and 
dignity 
attaches 
to 
the 
exercise 
of 
governmental 
functions. 
Up 
to 
very 
recently 
public 
officials 
in 
Germany 
enjoyed, 
and 
indeed 
still 
enjoy 
even 
today, 
a 
prestige 
that 
has 
made 
the 
most 
highly 
respected 
career 
that 
of 
a 
civil 
servant. 
The 
social 
esteem 
in 
which 
a 
young 
“assessor”[*] 
or 
lieutenant 
is 
held 
far 
exceeds 
that 
of 
a 
businessman 
or 
an 
attorney 
grown 
old 
in 
honest 
labor. 
Writers, 
scholars, 
and 
artists 
whose 
fame 
and 
glory 
have 
spread 
far 
beyond 
Germany 
enjoy 
in 
their 
own 
homeland 
only 
the 
respect 
corresponding 
to 
the 
often 
rather 
modest 
rank 
they 
occupied 
in 
the 
bureaucratic 
hierarchy. 


There 
is 
no 
rational 
basis 
for 
this 
overestimation 
of 
the 
activities 
carried 
on 
in 
the 
offices 
of 
the 
administrative 
authorities. 
It 
is 
a 
form 
of 
atavism, 
a 
vestige 
from 
the 
days 
when 
the 
burgher 
had 
to 
fear 
the 
prince 
and 
his 
knights 
because 
at 
any 
moment 
he 
might 
be 
spoliated 
by 
them. 
In 
itself 
it 
is 
no 
finer, 
nobler, 
or 
more 
honorable 
to 
spend 
one’s 
days 
in 
a 
government 
office 
filling 
out 
documents 
than, 
for 
example, 
to 
work 
in 
the 
blueprint 
room 
of 
a 
machine 
factory. 
The 
tax 
collector 
has 
no 
more 
distinguished 
an 
occupation 
than 
those 
who 
are 
engaged 
in 
creating 
wealth 
directly, 
a 
part 
of 
which 
is 
skimmed 
off 
in 
the 
form 
of 
taxes 
to 
defray 
the 
expenses 
of 
the 
apparatus 
of 
government. 


This 
notion 
of 
the 
special 
distinction 
and 
dignity 
attaching 
to 
the 



exercise 
of 
all 
the 
functions 
of 
government 
is 
what 
constitutes 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
pseudodemocratic 
theory 
of 
the 
state. 
According 
to 
this 
doctrine, 
it 
is 
shameful 
for 
anyone 
to 
allow 
himself 
to 
be 
ruled 
by 
others. 
Its 
ideal 
is 
a 
constitution 
in 
which 
the 
whole 
people 
rules 
and 
governs. 
This, 
of 
course, 
never 
has 
been, 
never 
can 
be, 
and 
never 
will 
be 
possible, 
not 
even 
under 
the 
conditions 
prevailing 
in 
a 
small 
state. 
It 
was 
once 
thought 
that 
this 
ideal 
had 
been 
realized 
in 
the 
Greek 
city-states 
of 
antiquity 
and 
in 
the 
small 
cantons 
of 
the 
Swiss 
mountains. 
This 
too 
was 
a 
mistake. 
In 
Greece 
only 
a 
part 
of 
the 
populace, 
the 
free 
citizens, 
had 
any 
share 
in 
the 
government; 
the 
metics 
and 
slaves 
had 
none. 
In 
the 
Swiss 
cantons 
only 
certain 
matters 
of 
a 
purely 
local 
character 
were 
and 
still 
are 
settled 
on 
the 
constitutional 
principle 
of 
direct 
democracy; 
all 
affairs 
transcending 
these 
narrow 
territorial 
bounds 
are 
managed 
by 
the 
Federation, 
whose 
government 
by 
no 
means 
corresponds 
to 
the 
ideal 
of 
direct 
democracy. 


It 
is 
not 
at 
all 
shameful 
for 
a 
man 
to 
allow 
himself 
to 
be 
ruled 
by 
others. 
Government 
and 
administration, 
the 
enforcement 
of 
police 
regulations 
and 
similar 
ordinances, 
also 
require 
specialists: 
professional 
civil 
servants 
and 
professional 
politicians. 
The 
principle 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
does 
not 
stop 
short 
even 
of 
the 
functions 
of 
government. 
One 
cannot 
be 
an 
engineer 
and 
a 
policeman 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
It 
in 
no 
way 
detracts 
from 
my 
dignity, 
my 
wellbeing, 
or 
my 
freedom 
that 
I 
am 
not 
myself 
a 
policeman. 
It 
is 
no 
more 
undemocratic 
for 
a 
few 
people 
to 
have 
the 
responsibility 
of 
providing 
protection 
for 
everyone 
else 
than 
it 
is 
for 
a 
few 
people 
to 
undertake 
to 
produce 
shoes 
for 
everyone 
else. 
There 
is 
not 
the 
slightest 
reason 
to 
object 
to 
professional 
politicians 
and 
professional 
civil 
servants 
if 
the 
institutions 
of 
the 
state 
are 
democratic. 
But 
democracy 
is 
something 
entirely 
different 
from 
what 
the 
romantic 
visionaries 
who 
prattle 
about 
direct 
democracy 
imagine. 


Government 
by 
a 
handful 
of 
people—and 
the 
rulers 
are 
always 
as 
much 
in 
the 
minority 
as 
against 
those 
ruled 
as 
the 
producers 
of 
shoes 
are 
as 
against 
the 
consumers 
of 
shoes—depends 
on 
the 
consent 
of 
the 
governed, 
i.e., 
on 
their 
acceptance 
of 
the 
existing 
administration. 
They 
may 
see 
it 
only 
as 
the 
lesser 
evil, 
or 
as 
an 
unavoidable 
evil, 
yet 
they 
must 
be 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
a 
change 
in 
the 
existing 
situation 
would 
have 
no 
purpose. 
But 
once 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
governed 
becomes 
convinced 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
and 
possible 
to 
change 
the 
form 
of 
government 
and 
to 
replace 
the 
old 
regime 
and 
the 
old 
personnel 
with 
a 
new 
regime 
and 
new 
personnel, 
the 
days 
of 
the 
former 
are 



numbered. 
The 
majority 
will 
have 
the 
power 
to 
carry 
out 
its 
wishes 
by 
force 
even 
against 
the 
will 
of 
the 
old 
regime. 
In 
the 
long 
run 
no 
government 
can 
maintain 
itself 
in 
power 
if 
it 
does 
not 
have 
public 
opinion 
behind 
it, 
i.e., 
if 
those 
governed 
are 
not 
convinced 
that 
the 
government 
is 
good. 
The 
force 
to 
which 
the 
government 
resorts 
in 
order 
to 
make 
refractory 
spirits 
compliant 
can 
be 
successfully 
applied 
only 
as 
long 
as 
the 
majority 
does 
not 
stand 
solidly 
in 
opposition. 


There 
is, 
therefore, 
in 
every 
form 
of 
polity 
a 
means 
for 
making 
the 
government 
at 
least 
ultimately 
dependent 
on 
the 
will 
of 
the 
governed, 
viz., 
civil 
war, 
revolution, 
insurrection. 
But 
it 
is 
just 
this 
expedient 
that 
liberalism 
wants 
to 
avoid. 
There 
can 
be 
no 
lasting 
economic 
improvement 
if 
the 
peaceful 
course 
of 
affairs 
is 
continually 
interrupted 
by 
internal 
struggles. 
A 
political 
situation 
such 
as 
existed 
in 
England 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Wars 
of 
the 
Roses 
would 
plunge 
modern 
England 
in 
a 
few 
years 
into 
the 
deepest 
and 
most 
dreadful 
misery. 
The 
present 
level 
of 
economic 
development 
would 
never 
have 
been 
attained 
if 
no 
solution 
had 
been 
found 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
preventing 
the 
continual 
outbreak 
of 
civil 
wars. 
A 
fratricidal 
struggle 
like 
the 
French 
Revolution 
of 
1789 
cost 
a 
heavy 
loss 
in 
life 
and 
property. 
Our 
present 
economy 
could 
no 
longer 
endure 
such 
convulsions. 
The 
population 
of 
a 
modern 
metropolis 
would 
have 
to 
suffer 
so 
frightfully 
from 
a 
revolutionary 
uprising 
that 
could 
bar 
the 
importation 
of 
food 
and 
coal 
and 
cut 
off 
the 
flow 
of 
electricity, 
gas, 
and 
water 
that 
even 
the 
fear 
that 
such 
disturbances 
might 
break 
out 
would 
paralyze 
the 
life 
of 
the 
city. 


Here 
is 
where 
the 
social 
function 
performed 
by 
democracy 
finds 
its 
point 
of 
application. 
Democracy 
is 
that 
form 
of 
political 
constitution 
which 
makes 
possible 
the 
adaptation 
of 
the 
government 
to 
the 
wishes 
of 
the 
governed 
without 
violent 
struggles. 
If 
in 
a 
democratic 
state 
the 
government 
is 
no 
longer 
being 
conducted 
as 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
population 
would 
have 
it, 
no 
civil 
war 
is 
necessary 
to 
put 
into 
office 
those 
who 
are 
willing 
to 
work 
to 
suit 
the 
majority. 
By 
means 
of 
elections 
and 
parliamentary 
arrangements, 
the 
change 
of 
government 
is 
executed 
smoothly 
and 
without 
friction, 
violence, 
or 
bloodshed. 


9. 
Critique 
of 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
Force 
The 
champions 
of 
democracy 
in 
the 
eighteenth 
century 
argued 
that 
only 



monarchs 
and 
their 
ministers 
are 
morally 
depraved, 
injudicious, 
and 
evil. 
The 
people, 
however, 
are 
altogether 
good, 
pure, 
and 
noble, 
and 
have, 
besides, 
the 
intellectual 
gifts 
needed 
in 
order 
always 
to 
know 
and 
to 
do 
what 
is 
right. 
This 
is, 
of 
course, 
all 
nonsense, 
no 
less 
so 
than 
the 
flattery 
of 
the 
courtiers 
who 
ascribed 
all 
good 
and 
noble 
qualities 
to 
their 
princes. 
The 
people 
are 
the 
sum 
of 
all 
individual 
citizens; 
and 
if 
some 
individuals 
are 
not 
intelligent 
and 
noble, 
then 
neither 
are 
all 
together. 


Since 
mankind 
entered 
the 
age 
of 
democracy 
with 
such 
high-flown 
expectations, 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
disillusionment 
should 
soon 
have 
set 
in. 
It 
was 
quickly 
discovered 
that 
the 
democracies 
committed 
at 
least 
as 
many 
errors 
as 
the 
monarchies 
and 
aristocracies 
had. 
The 
comparison 
that 
people 
drew 
between 
the 
men 
whom 
the 
democracies 
placed 
at 
the 
head 
of 
the 
government 
and 
those 
whom 
the 
emperors 
and 
kings, 
in 
the 
exercise 
of 
their 
absolute 
power, 
had 
elevated 
to 
that 
position, 
proved 
by 
no 
means 
favorable 
to 
the 
new 
wielders 
of 
power. 
The 
French 
are 
wont 
to 
speak 
of 
“killing 
with 
ridicule.” 
And 
indeed, 
the 
statesmen 
representative 
of 
democracy 
soon 
rendered 
it 
everywhere 
ridiculous. 
Those 
of 
the 
old 
regime 
had 
displayed 
a 
certain 
aristocratic 
dignity, 
at 
least 
in 
their 
outward 
demeanor. 
The 
new 
ones, 
who 
replaced 
them, 
made 
themselves 
contemptible 
by 
their 
behavior. 
Nothing 
has 
done 
more 
harm 
to 
democracy 
in 
Germany 
and 
Austria 
than 
the 
hollow 
arrogance 
and 
impudent 
vanity 
with 
which 
the 
Social-Democratic 
leaders 
who 
rose 
to 
power 
after 
the 
collapse 
of 
the 
empire 
conducted 
themselves. 


Thus, 
wherever 
democracy 
triumphed, 
an 
antidemocratic 
doctrine 
soon 
arose 
in 
fundamental 
opposition 
to 
it. 
There 
is 
no 
sense, 
it 
was 
said, 
in 
allowing 
the 
majority 
to 
rule. 
The 
best 
ought 
to 
govern, 
even 
if 
they 
are 
in 
the 
minority. 
This 
seems 
so 
obvious 
that 
the 
supporters 
of 
antidemocratic 
movements 
of 
all 
kinds 
have 
steadily 
increased 
in 
number. 
The 
more 
contemptible 
the 
men 
whom 
democracy 
has 
placed 
at 
the 
top 
have 
proved 
themselves 
to 
be, 
the 
greater 
has 
grown 
the 
number 
of 
the 
enemies 
of 
democracy. 


There 
are, 
however, 
serious 
fallacies 
in 
the 
antidemocratic 
doctrine. 
What, 
after 
all, 
does 
it 
mean 
to 
speak 
of 
“the 
best 
man” 
or 
“the 
best 
men”? 
The 
Republic 
of 
Poland 
placed 
a 
piano 
virtuoso 
at 
its 
head 
because 
it 
considered 
him 
the 
best 
Pole 
of 
the 
age. 
But 
the 
qualities 
that 
the 
leader 
of 
a 
state 
must 
have 
are 
very 
different 
from 
those 
of 
a 
musician. 
The 
opponents 
of 



democracy, 
when 
they 
use 
the 
expression 
“the 
best,” 
can 
mean 
nothing 
else 
than 
the 
man 
or 
the 
men 
best 
fitted 
to 
conduct 
the 
affairs 
of 
the 
government, 
even 
if 
they 
understand 
little 
or 
nothing 
of 
music. 
But 
this 
leads 
to 
the 
same 
political 
question: 
Who 
is 
the 
best 
fitted? 
Was 
it 
Disraeli 
or 
Gladstone? 
The 
Tory 
saw 
the 
best 
man 
in 
the 
former; 
the 
Whig, 
in 
the 
latter. 
Who 
should 
decide 
this 
if 
not 
the 
majority? 


And 
so 
we 
reach 
the 
decisive 
point 
of 
all 
antidemocratic 
doctrines, 
whether 
advanced 
by 
the 
descendants 
of 
the 
old 
aristocracy 
and 
the 
supporters 
of 
hereditary 
monarchy, 
or 
by 
the 
syndicalists, 
Bolsheviks, 
and 
socialists, 
viz., 
the 
doctrine 
of 
force. 
The 
opponents 
of 
democracy 
champion 
the 
right 
of 
a 
minority 
to 
seize 
control 
of 
the 
state 
by 
force 
and 
to 
rule 
over 
the 
majority. 
The 
moral 
justification 
of 
this 
procedure 
consists, 
it 
is 
thought, 
precisely 
in 
the 
power 
actually 
to 
seize 
the 
reins 
of 
government. 
One 
recognizes 
the 
best, 
those 
who 
alone 
are 
competent 
to 
govern 
and 
command, 
by 
virtue 
of 
their 
demonstrated 
ability 
to 
impose 
their 
rule 
on 
the 
majority 
against 
its 
will. 
Here 
the 
teaching 
of 
l’Action 
Française 
coincides 
with 
that 
of 
the 
syndicalists, 
and 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Ludendorff 
and 
Hitler, 
with 
that 
of 
Lenin 
and 
Trotzky. 


Many 
arguments 
can 
be 
urged 
for 
and 
against 
these 
doctrines, 
depending 
on 
one’s 
religious 
and 
philosophical 
convictions, 
about 
which 
any 
agreement 
is 
scarcely 
to 
be 
expected. 
This 
is 
not 
the 
place 
to 
present 
and 
discuss 
the 
arguments 
pro 
and 
con, 
for 
they 
are 
not 
conclusive. 
The 
only 
consideration 
that 
can 
be 
decisive 
is 
one 
that 
bases 
itself 
on 
the 
fundamental 
argument 
in 
favor 
of 
democracy. 


If 
every 
group 
that 
believes 
itself 
capable 
of 
imposing 
its 
rule 
on 
the 
rest 
is 
to 
be 
entitled 
to 
undertake 
the 
attempt, 
we 
must 
be 
prepared 
for 
an 
uninterrupted 
series 
of 
civil 
wars. 
But 
such 
a 
state 
of 
affairs 
is 
incompatible 
with 
the 
stage 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
that 
we 
have 
reached 
today. 
Modern 
society, 
based 
as 
it 
is 
on 
the 
division 
of 
labor, 
can 
be 
preserved 
only 
under 
conditions 
of 
lasting 
peace. 
If 
we 
had 
to 
prepare 
for 
the 
possibility 
of 
continual 
civil 
wars 
and 
internal 
struggles, 
we 
should 
have 
to 
retrogress 
to 
such 
a 
primitive 
stage 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
that 
each 
province 
at 
least, 
if 
not 
each 
village, 
would 
become 
virtually 
autarkic, 
i.e., 
capable 
of 
feeding 
and 
maintaining 
itself 
for 
a 
time 
as 
a 
self-sufficient 
economic 
entity 
without 
importing 
anything 
from 
the 
outside. 
This 
would 
mean 
such 
an 
enormous 
decline 
in 
the 
productivity 
of 
labor 
that 
the 
earth 
could 
feed 
only 
a 
fraction 
of 



the 
population 
that 
it 
supports 
today. 
The 
antidemocratic 
ideal 
leads 
to 
the 
kind 
of 
economic 
order 
known 
to 
the 
Middle 
Ages 
and 
antiquity. 
Every 
city, 
every 
village, 
indeed, 
every 
individual 
dwelling 
was 
fortified 
and 
equipped 
for 
defense, 
and 
every 
province 
was 
as 
independent 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
world 
as 
possible 
in 
its 
provision 
of 
commodities. 


The 
democrat 
too 
is 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
the 
best 
man 
ought 
to 
rule. 
But 
he 
believes 
that 
the 
fitness 
of 
a 
man 
or 
of 
a 
group 
of 
men 
to 
govern 
is 
better 
demonstrated 
if 
they 
succeed 
in 
convincing 
their 
fellow 
citizens 
of 
their 
qualifications 
for 
that 
position, 
so 
that 
they 
are 
voluntarily 
entrusted 
with 
the 
conduct 
of 
public 
affairs, 
than 
if 
they 
resort 
to 
force 
to 
compel 
others 
to 
acknowledge 
their 
claims. 
Whoever 
does 
not 
succeed 
in 
attaining 
to 
a 
position 
of 
leadership 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
power 
of 
his 
arguments 
and 
the 
confidence 
that 
his 
person 
inspires 
has 
no 
reason 
to 
complain 
about 
the 
fact 
that 
his 
fellow 
citizens 
prefer 
others 
to 
him. 


To 
be 
sure, 
it 
should 
not 
and 
need 
not 
be 
denied 
that 
there 
is 
one 
situation 
in 
which 
the 
temptation 
to 
deviate 
from 
the 
democratic 
principles 
of 
liberalism 
becomes 
very 
great 
indeed. 
If 
judicious 
men 
see 
their 
nation, 
or 
all 
the 
nations 
of 
the 
world, 
on 
the 
road 
to 
destruction, 
and 
if 
they 
find 
it 
impossible 
to 
induce 
their 
fellow 
citizens 
to 
heed 
their 
counsel, 
they 
may 
be 
inclined 
to 
think 
it 
only 
fair 
and 
just 
to 
resort 
to 
any 
means 
whatever, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
feasible 
and 
will 
lead 
to 
the 
desired 
goal, 
in 
order 
to 
save 
everyone 
from 
disaster. 
Then 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
elite, 
of 
a 
government 
by 
the 
minority 
maintained 
in 
power 
by 
force 
and 
ruling 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
all, 
may 
arise 
and 
find 
supporters. 
But 
force 
is 
never 
a 
means 
of 
overcoming 
these 
difficulties. 
The 
tyranny 
of 
a 
minority 
can 
never 
endure 
unless 
it 
succeeds 
in 
convincing 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
necessity 
or, 
at 
any 
rate, 
of 
the 
utility, 
of 
its 
rule. 
But 
then 
the 
minority 
no 
longer 
needs 
force 
to 
maintain 
itself 
in 
power. 


History 
provides 
an 
abundance 
of 
striking 
examples 
to 
show 
that, 
in 
the 
long 
run, 
even 
the 
most 
ruthless 
policy 
of 
repression 
does 
not 
suffice 
to 
maintain 
a 
government 
in 
power. 
To 
cite 
but 
one, 
the 
most 
recent 
and 
the 
best 
known: 
when 
the 
Bolsheviks 
seized 
control 
in 
Russia, 
they 
were 
a 
small 
minority, 
and 
their 
program 
found 
scant 
support 
among 
the 
great 
masses 
of 
their 
countrymen. 
For 
the 
peasantry, 
who 
constitute 
the 
bulk 
of 
the 
Russian 
people, 
would 
have 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
Bolshevik 
policy 
of 
farm 
collectivization. 
What 
they 
wanted 
was 
the 
division 
of 
the 
land 
among 
the 



“landed 
poverty,” 
as 
the 
Bolsheviks 
call 
this 
part 
of 
the 
population. 
And 
it 
was 
this 
program 
of 
the 
peasantry, 
not 
that 
of 
the 
Marxist 
leaders, 
which 
was 
actually 
put 
into 
effect. 
In 
order 
to 
remain 
in 
power, 
Lenin 
and 
Trotzky 
not 
only 
accepted 
this 
agrarian 
reform, 
but 
even 
made 
it 
a 
part 
of 
their 
own 
program, 
which 
they 
undertook 
to 
defend 
against 
all 
attacks, 
domestic 
and 
foreign. 
Only 
thus 
were 
the 
Bolsheviks 
able 
to 
win 
the 
confidence 
of 
the 
great 
mass 
of 
the 
Russian 
people. 
Since 
they 
adopted 
this 
policy 
of 
land 
distribution, 
the 
Bolsheviks 
rule 
no 
longer 
against 
the 
will 
of 
the 
great 
mass 
of 
the 
people, 
but 
with 
their 
consent 
and 
support. 
There 
were 
only 
two 
possible 
alternatives 
open 
to 
them: 
either 
their 
program 
or 
their 
control 
of 
the 
government 
had 
to 
be 
sacrificed. 
They 
chose 
the 
first 
and 
remained 
in 
power. 
The 
third 
possibility, 
to 
carry 
out 
their 
program 
by 
force 
against 
the 
will 
of 
the 
great 
mass 
of 
the 
people, 
did 
not 
exist 
at 
all. 
Like 
every 
determined 
and 
well-led 
minority, 
the 
Bolsheviks 
were 
able 
to 
seize 
control 
by 
force 
and 
retain 
it 
for 
a 
short 
time. 
In 
the 
long 
run, 
however, 
they 
would 
have 
been 
no 
better 
able 
to 
keep 
it 
than 
any 
other 
minority. 
The 
various 
attempts 
of 
the 
Whites 
to 
dislodge 
the 
Bolsheviks 
all 
failed 
because 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
Russian 
people 
were 
against 
them. 
But 
even 
if 
they 
had 
succeeded, 
the 
victors 
too 
would 
have 
had 
to 
respect 
the 
desires 
of 
the 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
the 
population. 
It 
would 
have 
been 
impossible 
for 
them 
to 
alter 
in 
any 
way 
after 
the 
event 
the 
already 
accomplished 
fact 
of 
the 
land 
distribution 
and 
to 
restore 
to 
the 
landowners 
what 
had 
been 
stolen 
from 
them. 


Only 
a 
group 
that 
can 
count 
on 
the 
consent 
of 
the 
governed 
can 
establish 
a 
lasting 
regime. 
Whoever 
wants 
to 
see 
the 
world 
governed 
according 
to 
his 
own 
ideas 
must 
strive 
for 
dominion 
over 
men’s 
minds. 
It 
is 
impossible, 
in 
the 
long 
run, 
to 
subject 
men 
against 
their 
will 
to 
a 
regime 
that 
they 
reject. 
Whoever 
tries 
to 
do 
so 
by 
force 
will 
ultimately 
come 
to 
grief, 
and 
the 
struggles 
provoked 
by 
his 
attempt 
will 
do 
more 
harm 
than 
the 
worst 
government 
based 
on 
the 
consent 
of 
the 
governed 
could 
ever 
do. 
Men 
cannot 
be 
made 
happy 
against 
their 
will. 


10. 
The 
Argument 
of 
Fascism 
If 
liberalism 
nowhere 
found 
complete 
acceptance, 
its 
success 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
went 
so 
far 
at 
least 
as 
that 
some 
of 
the 
most 
important 
of 
its 
principles 
were 
considered 
beyond 
dispute. 
Before 
1914, 
even 
the 
most 



dogged 
and 
bitter 
enemies 
of 
liberalism 
had 
to 
resign 
themselves 
to 
allowing 
many 
liberal 
principles 
to 
pass 
unchallenged. 
Even 
in 
Russia, 
where 
only 
a 
few 
feeble 
rays 
of 
liberalism 
had 
penetrated, 
the 
supporters 
of 
the 
Czarist 
despotism, 
in 
persecuting 
their 
opponents, 
still 
had 
to 
take 
into 
consideration 
the 
liberal 
opinions 
of 
Europe; 
and 
during 
the 
World 
War, 
the 
war 
parties 
in 
the 
belligerent 
nations, 
with 
all 
their 
zeal, 
still 
had 
to 
practice 
a 
certain 
moderation 
in 
their 
struggle 
against 
internal 
opposition. 


Only 
when 
the 
Marxist 
Social 
Democrats 
had 
gained 
the 
upper 
hand 
and 
taken 
power 
in 
the 
belief 
that 
the 
age 
of 
liberalism 
and 
capitalism 
had 
passed 
forever 
did 
the 
last 
concessions 
disappear 
that 
it 
had 
still 
been 
thought 
necessary 
to 
make 
to 
the 
liberal 
ideology. 
The 
parties 
of 
the 
Third 
International 
consider 
any 
means 
as 
permissible 
if 
it 
seems 
to 
give 
promise 
of 
helping 
them 
in 
their 
struggle 
to 
achieve 
their 
ends. 
Whoever 
does 
not 
unconditionally 
acknowledge 
all 
their 
teachings 
as 
the 
only 
correct 
ones 
and 
stand 
by 
them 
through 
thick 
and 
thin 
has, 
in 
their 
opinion, 
incurred 
the 
penalty 
of 
death; 
and 
they 
do 
not 
hesitate 
to 
exterminate 
him 
and 
his 
whole 
family, 
infants 
included, 
whenever 
and 
wherever 
it 
is 
physically 
possible. 


The 
frank 
espousal 
of 
a 
policy 
of 
annihilating 
opponents 
and 
the 
murders 
committed 
in 
the 
pursuance 
of 
it 
have 
given 
rise 
to 
an 
opposition 
movement. 
All 
at 
once 
the 
scales 
fell 
from 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
non-Communist 
enemies 
of 
liberalism. 
Until 
then 
they 
had 
believed 
that 
even 
in 
a 
struggle 
against 
a 
hateful 
opponent 
one 
still 
had 
to 
respect 
certain 
liberal 
principles. 
They 
had 
had, 
even 
though 
reluctantly, 
to 
exclude 
murder 
and 
assassination 
from 
the 
list 
of 
measures 
to 
be 
resorted 
to 
in 
political 
struggles. 
They 
had 
had 
to 
resign 
themselves 
to 
many 
limitations 
in 
persecuting 
the 
opposition 
press 
and 
in 
suppressing 
the 
spoken 
word. 
Now, 
all 
at 
once, 
they 
saw 
that 
opponents 
had 
risen 
up 
who 
gave 
no 
heed 
to 
such 
considerations 
and 
for 
whom 
any 
means 
was 
good 
enough 
to 
defeat 
an 
adversary. 
The 
militaristic 
and 
nationalistic 
enemies 
of 
the 
Third 
International 
felt 
themselves 
cheated 
by 
liberalism. 
Liberalism, 
they 
thought, 
stayed 
their 
hand 
when 
they 
desired 
to 
strike 
a 
blow 
against 
the 
revolutionary 
parties 
while 
it 
was 
still 
possible 
to 
do 
so. 
If 
liberalism 
had 
not 
hindered 
them, 
they 
would, 
so 
they 
believe, 
have 
bloodily 
nipped 
the 
revolutionary 
movements 
in 
the 
bud. 
Revolutionary 
ideas 
had 
been 
able 
to 
take 
root 
and 
flourish 
only 
because 
of 
the 
tolerance 
they 
had 
been 
accorded 
by 
their 
opponents, 
whose 
will 
power 
had 
been 
enfeebled 
by 
a 
regard 
for 
liberal 
principles 
that, 
as 
events 
subsequently 
proved, 
was 



overscrupulous. 
If 
the 
idea 
had 
occurred 
to 
them 
years 
ago 
that 
it 
is 
permissible 
to 
crush 
ruthlessly 
every 
revolutionary 
movement, 
the 
victories 
that 
the 
Third 
International 
has 
won 
since 
1917 
would 
never 
have 
been 
possible. 
For 
the 
militarists 
and 
nationalists 
believe 
that 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
shooting 
and 
fighting, 
they 
themselves 
are 
the 
most 
accurate 
marksmen 
and 
the 
most 
adroit 
fighters. 


The 
fundamental 
idea 
of 
these 
movements—which, 
from 
the 
name 
of 
the 
most 
grandiose 
and 
tightly 
disciplined 
among 
them, 
the 
Italian, 
may, 
in 
general, 
be 
designated 
as 
Fascist—consists 
in 
the 
proposal 
to 
make 
use 
of 
the 
same 
unscrupulous 
methods 
in 
the 
struggle 
against 
the 
Third 
International 
as 
the 
latter 
employs 
against 
its 
opponents. 
The 
Third 
International 
seeks 
to 
exterminate 
its 
adversaries 
and 
their 
ideas 
in 
the 
same 
way 
that 
the 
hygienist 
strives 
to 
exterminate 
a 
pestilential 
bacillus; 
it 
considers 
itself 
in 
no 
way 
bound 
by 
the 
terms 
of 
any 
compact 
that 
it 
may 
conclude 
with 
opponents, 
and 
it 
deems 
any 
crime, 
any 
lie, 
and 
any 
calumny 
permissible 
in 
carrying 
on 
its 
struggle. 
The 
Fascists, 
at 
least 
in 
principle, 
profess 
the 
same 
intentions. 
That 
they 
have 
not 
yet 
succeeded 
as 
fully 
as 
the 
Russian 
Bolsheviks 
in 
freeing 
themselves 
from 
a 
certain 
regard 
for 
liberal 
notions 
and 
ideas 
and 
traditional 
ethical 
precepts 
is 
to 
be 
attributed 
solely 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Fascists 
carry 
on 
their 
work 
among 
nations 
in 
which 
the 
intellectual 
and 
moral 
heritage 
of 
some 
thousands 
of 
years 
of 
civilization 
cannot 
be 
destroyed 
at 
one 
blow, 
and 
not 
among 
the 
barbarian 
peoples 
on 
both 
sides 
of 
the 
Urals, 
whose 
relationship 
to 
civilization 
has 
never 
been 
any 
other 
than 
that 
of 
marauding 
denizens 
of 
forest 
and 
desert 
accustomed 
to 
engage, 
from 
time 
to 
time, 
in 
predatory 
raids 
on 
civilized 
lands 
in 
the 
hunt 
for 
booty. 
Because 
of 
this 
difference, 
Fascism 
will 
never 
succeed 
as 
completely 
as 
Russian 
Bolshevism 
in 
freeing 
itself 
from 
the 
power 
of 
liberal 
ideas. 
Only 
under 
the 
fresh 
impression 
of 
the 
murders 
and 
atrocities 
perpetrated 
by 
the 
supporters 
of 
the 
Soviets 
were 
Germans 
and 
Italians 
able 
to 
block 
out 
the 
remembrance 
of 
the 
traditional 
restraints 
of 
justice 
and 
morality 
and 
find 
the 
impulse 
to 
bloody 
counteraction. 
The 
deeds 
of 
the 
Fascists 
and 
of 
other 
parties 
corresponding 
to 
them 
were 
emotional 
reflex 
actions 
evoked 
by 
indignation 
at 
the 
deeds 
of 
the 
Bolsheviks 
and 
Communists. 
As 
soon 
as 
the 
first 
flush 
of 
anger 
had 
passed, 
their 
policy 
took 
a 
more 
moderate 
course 
and 
will 
probably 
become 
even 
more 
so 
with 
the 
passage 
of 
time. 


This 
moderation 
is 
the 
result 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
traditional 
liberal 
views 
still 



continue 
to 
have 
an 
unconscious 
influence 
on 
the 
Fascists. 
But 
however 
far 
this 
may 
go, 
one 
must 
not 
fail 
to 
recognize 
that 
the 
conversion 
of 
the 
Rightist 
parties 
to 
the 
tactics 
of 
Fascism 
shows 
that 
the 
battle 
against 
liberalism 
has 
resulted 
in 
successes 
that, 
only 
a 
short 
time 
ago, 
would 
have 
been 
considered 
completely 
unthinkable. 
Many 
people 
approve 
of 
the 
methods 
of 
Fascism, 
even 
though 
its 
economic 
program 
is 
altogether 
antiliberal 
and 
its 
policy 
completely 
interventionist, 
because 
it 
is 
far 
from 
practicing 
the 
senseless 
and 
unrestrained 
destructionism 
that 
has 
stamped 
the 
Communists 
as 
the 
archenemies 
of 
civilization. 
Still 
others, 
in 
full 
knowledge 
of 
the 
evil 
that 
Fascist 
economic 
policy 
brings 
with 
it, 
view 
Fascism, 
in 
comparison 
with 
Bolshevism 
and 
Sovietism, 
as 
at 
least 
the 
lesser 
evil. 
For 
the 
majority 
of 
its 
public 
and 
secret 
supporters 
and 
admirers, 
however, 
its 
appeal 
consists 
precisely 
in 
the 
violence 
of 
its 
methods. 


Now 
it 
cannot 
be 
denied 
that 
the 
only 
way 
one 
can 
offer 
effective 
resistance 
to 
violent 
assaults 
is 
by 
violence. 
Against 
the 
weapons 
of 
the 
Bolsheviks, 
weapons 
must 
be 
used 
in 
reprisal, 
and 
it 
would 
be 
a 
mistake 
to 
display 
weakness 
before 
murderers. 
No 
liberal 
has 
ever 
called 
this 
into 
question. 
What 
distinguishes 
liberal 
from 
Fascist 
political 
tactics 
is 
not 
a 
difference 
of 
opinion 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
necessity 
of 
using 
armed 
force 
to 
resist 
armed 
attackers, 
but 
a 
difference 
in 
the 
fundamental 
estimation 
of 
the 
role 
of 
violence 
in 
a 
struggle 
for 
power. 
The 
great 
danger 
threatening 
domestic 
policy 
from 
the 
side 
of 
Fascism 
lies 
in 
its 
complete 
faith 
in 
the 
decisive 
power 
of 
violence. 
In 
order 
to 
assure 
success, 
one 
must 
be 
imbued 
with 
the 
will 
to 
victory 
and 
always 
proceed 
violently. 
This 
is 
its 
highest 
principle. 
What 
happens, 
however, 
when 
one’s 
opponent, 
similarly 
animated 
by 
the 
will 
to 
be 
victorious, 
acts 
just 
as 
violently? 
The 
result 
must 
be 
a 
battle, 
a 
civil 
war. 
The 
ultimate 
victor 
to 
emerge 
from 
such 
conflicts 
will 
be 
the 
faction 
strongest 
in 
number. 
In 
the 
long 
run, 
a 
minority—even 
if 
it 
is 
composed 
of 
the 
most 
capable 
and 
energetic—cannot 
succeed 
in 
resisting 
the 
majority. 
The 
decisive 
question, 
therefore, 
always 
remains: 
How 
does 
one 
obtain 
a 
majority 
for 
one’s 
own 
party? 
This, 
however, 
is 
a 
purely 
intellectual 
matter. 
It 
is 
a 
victory 
that 
can 
be 
won 
only 
with 
the 
weapons 
of 
the 
intellect, 
never 
by 
force. 
The 
suppression 
of 
all 
opposition 
by 
sheer 
violence 
is 
a 
most 
unsuitable 
way 
to 
win 
adherents 
to 
one’s 
cause. 
Resort 
to 
naked 
force—that 
is, 
without 
justification 
in 
terms 
of 
intellectual 
arguments 
accepted 
by 
public 
opinion— 
merely 
gains 
new 
friends 
for 
those 
whom 
one 
is 
thereby 
trying 
to 
combat. 
In 



a 
battle 
between 
force 
and 
an 
idea, 
the 
latter 
always 
prevails. 


Fascism 
can 
triumph 
today 
because 
universal 
indignation 
at 
the 
infamies 
committed 
by 
the 
socialists 
and 
communists 
has 
obtained 
for 
it 
the 
sympathies 
of 
wide 
circles. 
But 
when 
the 
fresh 
impression 
of 
the 
crimes 
of 
the 
Bolsheviks 
has 
paled, 
the 
socialist 
program 
will 
once 
again 
exercise 
its 
power 
of 
attraction 
on 
the 
masses. 
For 
Fascism 
does 
nothing 
to 
combat 
it 
except 
to 
suppress 
socialist 
ideas 
and 
to 
persecute 
the 
people 
who 
spread 
them. 
If 
it 
wanted 
really 
to 
combat 
socialism, 
it 
would 
have 
to 
oppose 
it 
with 
ideas. 
There 
is, 
however, 
only 
one 
idea 
that 
can 
be 
effectively 
opposed 
to 
socialism, 
viz., 
that 
of 
liberalism. 


It 
has 
often 
been 
said 
that 
nothing 
furthers 
a 
cause 
more 
than 
creating 
martyrs 
for 
it. 
This 
is 
only 
approximately 
correct. 
What 
strengthens 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
persecuted 
faction 
is 
not 
the 
martyrdom 
of 
its 
adherents, 
but 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
are 
being 
attacked 
by 
force, 
and 
not 
by 
intellectual 
weapons. 
Repression 
by 
brute 
force 
is 
always 
a 
confession 
of 
the 
inability 
to 
make 
use 
of 
the 
better 
weapons 
of 
the 
intellect—better 
because 
they 
alone 
give 
promise 
of 
final 
success. 
This 
is 
the 
fundamental 
error 
from 
which 
Fascism 
suffers 
and 
which 
will 
ultimately 
cause 
its 
downfall. 
The 
victory 
of 
Fascism 
in 
a 
number 
of 
countries 
is 
only 
an 
episode 
in 
the 
long 
series 
of 
struggles 
over 
the 
problem 
of 
property. 
The 
next 
episode 
will 
be 
the 
victory 
of 
Communism. 
The 
ultimate 
outcome 
of 
the 
struggle, 
however, 
will 
not 
be 
decided 
by 
arms, 
but 
by 
ideas. 
It 
is 
ideas 
that 
group 
men 
into 
fighting 
factions, 
that 
press 
the 
weapons 
into 
their 
hands, 
and 
that 
determine 
against 
whom 
and 
for 
whom 
the 
weapons 
shall 
be 
used. 
It 
is 
they 
alone, 
and 
not 
arms, 
that, 
in 
the 
last 
analysis, 
turn 
the 
scales. 


So 
much 
for 
the 
domestic 
policy 
of 
Fascism. 
That 
its 
foreign 
policy, 
based 
as 
it 
is 
on 
the 
avowed 
principle 
of 
force 
in 
international 
relations, 
cannot 
fail 
to 
give 
rise 
to 
an 
endless 
series 
of 
wars 
that 
must 
destroy 
all 
of 
modern 
civilization 
requires 
no 
further 
discussion. 
To 
maintain 
and 
further 
raise 
our 
present 
level 
of 
economic 
development, 
peace 
among 
nations 
must 
be 
assured. 
But 
they 
cannot 
live 
together 
in 
peace 
if 
the 
basic 
tenet 
of 
the 
ideology 
by 
which 
they 
are 
governed 
is 
the 
belief 
that 
one’s 
own 
nation 
can 
secure 
its 
place 
in 
the 
community 
of 
nations 
by 
force 
alone. 


It 
cannot 
be 
denied 
that 
Fascism 
and 
similar 
movements 
aiming 
at 
the 
establishment 
of 
dictatorships 
are 
full 
of 
the 
best 
intentions 
and 
that 
their 
intervention 
has, 
for 
the 
moment, 
saved 
European 
civilization. 
The 
merit 
that 



Fascism 
has 
thereby 
won 
for 
itself 
will 
live 
on 
eternally 
in 
history. 
But 
though 
its 
policy 
has 
brought 
salvation 
for 
the 
moment, 
it 
is 
not 
of 
the 
kind 
which 
could 
promise 
continued 
success. 
Fascism 
was 
an 
emergency 
makeshift. 
To 
view 
it 
as 
something 
more 
would 
be 
a 
fatal 
error. 


11. 
The 
Limits 
of 
Governmental 
Activity 
As 
the 
liberal 
sees 
it, 
the 
task 
of 
the 
state 
consists 
solely 
and 
exclusively 
in 
guaranteeing 
the 
protection 
of 
life, 
health, 
liberty, 
and 
private 
property 
against 
violent 
attacks. 
Everything 
that 
goes 
beyond 
this 
is 
an 
evil. 
A 
government 
that, 
instead 
of 
fulfilling 
its 
task, 
sought 
to 
go 
so 
far 
as 
actually 
to 
infringe 
on 
personal 
security 
of 
life 
and 
health, 
freedom, 
and 
property 
would, 
of 
course, 
be 
altogether 
bad. 


Still, 
as 
Jacob 
Burckhardt 
says, 
power 
is 
evil 
in 
itself, 
no 
matter 
who 
exercises 
it. 
It 
tends 
to 
corrupt 
those 
who 
wield 
it 
and 
leads 
to 
abuse. 
Not 
only 
absolute 
sovereigns 
and 
aristocrats, 
but 
the 
masses 
also, 
in 
whose 
hands 
democracy 
entrusts 
the 
supreme 
power 
of 
government, 
are 
only 
too 
easily 
inclined 
to 
excesses. 


In 
the 
United 
States, 
the 
manufacture 
and 
sale 
of 
alcoholic 
beverages 
are 
prohibited. 
Other 
countries 
do 
not 
go 
so 
far, 
but 
nearly 
everywhere 
some 
restrictions 
are 
imposed 
on 
the 
sale 
of 
opium, 
cocaine, 
and 
similar 
narcotics. 
It 
is 
universally 
deemed 
one 
of 
the 
tasks 
of 
legislation 
and 
government 
to 
protect 
the 
individual 
from 
himself. 
Even 
those 
who 
otherwise 
generally 
have 
misgivings 
about 
extending 
the 
area 
of 
governmental 
activity 
consider 
it 
quite 
proper 
that 
the 
freedom 
of 
the 
individual 
should 
be 
curtailed 
in 
this 
respect, 
and 
they 
think 
that 
only 
a 
benighted 
doctrinairism 
could 
oppose 
such 
prohibitions. 
Indeed, 
so 
general 
is 
the 
acceptance 
of 
this 
kind 
of 
interference 
by 
the 
authorities 
in 
the 
life 
of 
the 
individual 
that 
those 
who 
are 
opposed 
to 
liberalism 
on 
principle 
are 
prone 
to 
base 
their 
argument 
on 
the 
ostensibly 
undisputed 
acknowledgment 
of 
the 
necessity 
of 
such 
prohibitions 
and 
to 
draw 
from 
it 
the 
conclusion 
that 
complete 
freedom 
is 
an 
evil 
and 
that 
some 
measure 
of 
restriction 
must 
be 
imposed 
upon 
the 
freedom 
of 
the 
individual 
by 
the 
governmental 
authorities 
in 
their 
capacity 
as 
guardians 
of 
his 
welfare. 
The 
question 
cannot 
be 
whether 
the 
authorities 
ought 
to 
impose 
restrictions 
upon 
the 
freedom 
of 
the 
individual, 
but 
only 
how 
far 
they 
ought 
to 
go 
in 
this 
respect. 



No 
words 
need 
be 
wasted 
over 
the 
fact 
that 
all 
these 
narcotics 
are 
harmful. 
The 
question 
whether 
even 
a 
small 
quantity 
of 
alcohol 
is 
harmful 
or 
whether 
the 
harm 
results 
only 
from 
the 
abuse 
of 
alcoholic 
beverages 
is 
not 
at 
issue 
here. 
It 
is 
an 
established 
fact 
that 
alcoholism, 
cocainism, 
and 
morphinism 
are 
deadly 
enemies 
of 
life, 
of 
health, 
and 
of 
the 
capacity 
for 
work 
and 
enjoyment; 
and 
a 
utilitarian 
must 
therefore 
consider 
them 
as 
vices. 
But 
this 
is 
far 
from 
demonstrating 
that 
the 
authorities 
must 
interpose 
to 
suppress 
these 
vices 
by 
commercial 
prohibitions, 
nor 
is 
it 
by 
any 
means 
evident 
that 
such 
intervention 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
government 
is 
really 
capable 
of 
suppressing 
them 
or 
that, 
even 
if 
this 
end 
could 
be 
attained, 
it 
might 
not 
therewith 
open 
up 
a 
Pandora’s 
box 
of 
other 
dangers, 
no 
less 
mischievous 
than 
alcoholism 
and 
morphinism. 


Whoever 
is 
convinced 
that 
indulgence 
or 
excessive 
indulgence 
in 
these 
poisons 
is 
pernicious 
is 
not 
hindered 
from 
living 
abstemiously 
or 
temperately. 
This 
question 
cannot 
be 
treated 
exclusively 
in 
reference 
to 
alcoholism, 
morphinism, 
cocainism, 
etc., 
which 
all 
reasonable 
men 
acknowledge 
to 
be 
evils. 
For 
if 
the 
majority 
of 
citizens 
is, 
in 
principle, 
conceded 
the 
right 
to 
impose 
its 
way 
of 
life 
upon 
a 
minority, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
stop 
at 
prohibitions 
against 
indulgence 
in 
alcohol, 
morphine, 
cocaine, 
and 
similar 
poisons. 
Why 
should 
not 
what 
is 
valid 
for 
these 
poisons 
be 
valid 
also 
for 
nicotine, 
caffeine, 
and 
the 
like? 
Why 
should 
not 
the 
state 
generally 
prescribe 
which 
foods 
may 
be 
indulged 
in 
and 
which 
must 
be 
avoided 
because 
they 
are 
injurious? 
In 
sports 
too, 
many 
people 
are 
prone 
to 
carry 
their 
indulgence 
further 
than 
their 
strength 
will 
allow. 
Why 
should 
not 
the 
state 
interfere 
here 
as 
well? 
Few 
men 
know 
how 
to 
be 
temperate 
in 
their 
sexual 
life, 
and 
it 
seems 
especially 
difficult 
for 
aging 
persons 
to 
understand 
that 
they 
should 
cease 
entirely 
to 
indulge 
in 
such 
pleasures 
or, 
at 
least, 
do 
so 
in 
moderation. 
Should 
not 
the 
state 
intervene 
here 
too? 
More 
harmful 
still 
than 
all 
these 
pleasures, 
many 
will 
say, 
is 
the 
reading 
of 
evil 
literature. 
Should 
a 
press 
pandering 
to 
the 
lowest 
instincts 
of 
man 
be 
allowed 
to 
corrupt 
the 
soul? 
Should 
not 
the 
exhibition 
of 
pornographic 
pictures, 
of 
obscene 
plays, 
in 
short, 
of 
all 
allurements 
to 
immorality, 
be 
prohibited? 
And 
is 
not 
the 
dissemination 
of 
false 
sociological 
doctrines 
just 
as 
injurious 
to 
men 
and 
nations? 
Should 
men 
be 
permitted 
to 
incite 
others 
to 
civil 
war 
and 
to 
wars 
against 
foreign 
countries? 
And 
should 
scurrilous 
lampoons 
and 
blasphemous 
diatribes 
be 
allowed 
to 
undermine 
respect 
for 
God 
and 
the 
Church? 



We 
see 
that 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
surrender 
the 
principle 
that 
the 
state 
should 
not 
interfere 
in 
any 
questions 
touching 
on 
the 
individual’s 
mode 
of 
life, 
we 
end 
by 
regulating 
and 
restricting 
the 
latter 
down 
to 
the 
smallest 
detail. 
The 
personal 
freedom 
of 
the 
individual 
is 
abrogated. 
He 
becomes 
a 
slave 
of 
the 
community, 
bound 
to 
obey 
the 
dictates 
of 
the 
majority. 
It 
is 
hardly 
necessary 
to 
expatiate 
on 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
such 
powers 
could 
be 
abused 
by 
malevolent 
persons 
in 
authority. 
The 
wielding 
of 
powers 
of 
this 
kind 
even 
by 
men 
imbued 
with 
the 
best 
of 
intentions 
must 
needs 
reduce 
the 
world 
to 
a 
graveyard 
of 
the 
spirit. 
All 
mankind’s 
progress 
has 
been 
achieved 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
initiative 
of 
a 
small 
minority 
that 
began 
to 
deviate 
from 
the 
ideas 
and 
customs 
of 
the 
majority 
until 
their 
example 
finally 
moved 
the 
others 
to 
accept 
the 
innovation 
themselves. 
To 
give 
the 
majority 
the 
right 
to 
dictate 
to 
the 
minority 
what 
it 
is 
to 
think, 
to 
read, 
and 
to 
do 
is 
to 
put 
a 
stop 
to 
progress 
once 
and 
for 
all. 


Let 
no 
one 
object 
that 
the 
struggle 
against 
morphinism 
and 
the 
struggle 
against 
“evil” 
literature 
are 
two 
quite 
different 
things. 
The 
only 
difference 
between 
them 
is 
that 
some 
of 
the 
same 
people 
who 
favor 
the 
prohibition 
of 
the 
former 
will 
not 
agree 
to 
the 
prohibition 
of 
the 
latter. 
In 
the 
United 
States, 
the 
Methodists 
and 
Fundamentalists, 
right 
after 
the 
passage 
of 
the 
law 
prohibiting 
the 
manufacture 
and 
sale 
of 
alcoholic 
beverages, 
took 
up 
the 
struggle 
for 
the 
suppression 
of 
the 
theory 
of 
evolution, 
and 
they 
have 
already 
succeeded 
in 
ousting 
Darwinism 
from 
the 
schools 
in 
a 
number 
of 
states. 
In 
Soviet 
Russia, 
every 
free 
expression 
of 
opinion 
is 
suppressed. 
Whether 
or 
not 
permission 
is 
granted 
for 
a 
book 
to 
be 
published 
depends 
on 
the 
discretion 
of 
a 
number 
of 
uneducated 
and 
uncultivated 
fanatics 
who 
have 
been 
placed 
in 
charge 
of 
the 
arm 
of 
the 
government 
empowered 
to 
concern 
itself 
with 
such 
matters. 


The 
propensity 
of 
our 
contemporaries 
to 
demand 
authoritarian 
prohibition 
as 
soon 
as 
something 
does 
not 
please 
them, 
and 
their 
readiness 
to 
submit 
to 
such 
prohibitions 
even 
when 
what 
is 
prohibited 
is 
quite 
agreeable 
to 
them 
shows 
how 
deeply 
ingrained 
the 
spirit 
of 
servility 
still 
remains 
within 
them. 
It 
will 
require 
many 
long 
years 
of 
self-education 
until 
the 
subject 
can 
turn 
himself 
into 
the 
citizen. 
A 
free 
man 
must 
be 
able 
to 
endure 
it 
when 
his 
fellow 
men 
act 
and 
live 
otherwise 
than 
he 
considers 
proper. 
He 
must 
free 
himself 
from 
the 
habit, 
just 
as 
soon 
as 
something 
does 
not 
please 
him, 
of 
calling 
for 
the 
police. 



12. 
Tolerance 
Liberalism 
limits 
its 
concern 
entirely 
and 
exclusively 
to 
earthly 
life 
and 
earthly 
endeavor. 
The 
kingdom 
of 
religion, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
is 
not 
of 
this 
world. 
Thus, 
liberalism 
and 
religion 
could 
both 
exist 
side 
by 
side 
without 
their 
spheres’ 
touching. 
That 
they 
should 
have 
reached 
the 
point 
of 
collision 
was 
not 
the 
fault 
of 
liberalism. 
It 
did 
not 
transgress 
its 
proper 
sphere; 
it 
did 
not 
intrude 
into 
the 
domain 
of 
religious 
faith 
or 
of 
metaphysical 
doctrine. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
encountered 
the 
church 
as 
a 
political 
power 
claiming 
the 
right 
to 
regulate 
according 
to 
its 
judgment 
not 
only 
the 
relationship 
of 
man 
to 
the 
world 
to 
come, 
but 
also 
the 
affairs 
of 
this 
world. 
It 
was 
at 
this 
point 
that 
the 
battle 
lines 
had 
to 
be 
drawn. 


So 
overwhelming 
was 
the 
victory 
won 
by 
liberalism 
in 
this 
conflict 
that 
the 
church 
had 
to 
give 
up, 
once 
and 
for 
all, 
claims 
that 
it 
had 
vigorously 
maintained 
for 
thousands 
of 
years. 
The 
burning 
of 
heretics, 
inquisitorial 
persecutions, 
religious 
wars—these 
today 
belong 
to 
history. 
No 
one 
can 
understand 
any 
longer 
how 
quiet 
people, 
who 
practiced 
their 
devotions 
as 
they 
believed 
right 
within 
the 
four 
walls 
of 
their 
own 
home, 
could 
have 
been 
dragged 
before 
courts, 
incarcerated, 
martyred, 
and 
burned. 
But 
even 
if 
no 
more 
stakes 
are 
kindled 
ad 
majorem 
Dei 
gloriam, 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
intolerance 
still 
persists. 


Liberalism, 
however, 
must 
be 
intolerant 
of 
every 
kind 
of 
intolerance. 
If 
one 
considers 
the 
peaceful 
cooperation 
of 
all 
men 
as 
the 
goal 
of 
social 
evolution, 
one 
cannot 
permit 
the 
peace 
to 
be 
disturbed 
by 
priests 
and 
fanatics. 
Liberalism 
proclaims 
tolerance 
for 
every 
religious 
faith 
and 
every 
metaphysical 
belief, 
not 
out 
of 
indifference 
for 
these 
“higher” 
things, 
but 
from 
the 
conviction 
that 
the 
assurance 
of 
peace 
within 
society 
must 
take 
precedence 
over 
everything 
and 
everyone. 
And 
because 
it 
demands 
toleration 
of 
all 
opinions 
and 
all 
churches 
and 
sects, 
it 
must 
recall 
them 
all 
to 
their 
proper 
bounds 
whenever 
they 
venture 
intolerantly 
beyond 
them. 
In 
a 
social 
order 
based 
on 
peaceful 
cooperation, 
there 
is 
no 
room 
for 
the 
claim 
of 
the 
churches 
to 
monopolize 
the 
instruction 
and 
education 
of 
the 
young. 
Everything 
that 
their 
supporters 
accord 
them 
of 
their 
own 
free 
will 
may 
and 
must 
be 
granted 
to 
the 
churches; 
nothing 
may 
be 
permitted 
to 
them 
in 
respect 
to 
persons 
who 
want 
to 
have 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
them. 



It 
is 
difficult 
to 
understand 
how 
these 
principles 
of 
liberalism 
could 
make 
enemies 
among 
the 
communicants 
of 
the 
various 
faiths. 
If 
they 
make 
it 
impossible 
for 
a 
church 
to 
make 
converts 
by 
force, 
whether 
its 
own 
or 
that 
placed 
at 
its 
disposal 
by 
the 
state, 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
they 
also 
protect 
that 
church 
against 
coercive 
proselytization 
by 
other 
churches 
and 
sects. 
What 
liberalism 
takes 
from 
the 
church 
with 
one 
hand 
it 
gives 
back 
again 
with 
the 
other. 
Even 
religious 
zealots 
must 
concede 
that 
liberalism 
takes 
nothing 
from 
faith 
of 
what 
belongs 
to 
its 
proper 
sphere. 


To 
be 
sure, 
the 
churches 
and 
sects 
that, 
where 
they 
have 
the 
upper 
hand, 
cannot 
do 
enough 
in 
their 
persecution 
of 
dissenters, 
also 
demand, 
where 
they 
find 
themselves 
in 
the 
minority, 
tolerance 
at 
least 
for 
themselves. 
However, 
this 
demand 
for 
tolerance 
has 
nothing 
whatever 
in 
common 
with 
the 
liberal 
demand 
for 
tolerance. 
Liberalism 
demands 
tolerance 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
principle, 
not 
from 
opportunism. 
It 
demands 
toleration 
even 
of 
obviously 
nonsensical 
teachings, 
absurd 
forms 
of 
heterodoxy, 
and 
childishly 
silly 
superstitions. 
It 
demands 
toleration 
for 
doctrines 
and 
opinions 
that 
it 
deems 
detrimental 
and 
ruinous 
to 
society 
and 
even 
for 
movements 
that 
it 
indefatigably 
combats. 
For 
what 
impels 
liberalism 
to 
demand 
and 
accord 
toleration 
is 
not 
consideration 
for 
the 
content 
of 
the 
doctrine 
to 
be 
tolerated, 
but 
the 
knowledge 
that 
only 
tolerance 
can 
create 
and 
preserve 
the 
condition 
of 
social 
peace 
without 
which 
humanity 
must 
relapse 
into 
the 
barbarism 
and 
penury 
of 
centuries 
long 
past. 


Against 
what 
is 
stupid, 
nonsensical, 
erroneous, 
and 
evil, 
liberalism 
fights 
with 
the 
weapons 
of 
the 
mind, 
and 
not 
with 
brute 
force 
and 
repression. 


13. 
The 
State 
and 
Antisocial 
Conduct 
The 
state 
is 
the 
apparatus 
of 
compulsion 
and 
coercion. 
This 
holds 
not 
only 
for 
the 
“night-watchman” 
state, 
but 
just 
as 
much 
for 
every 
other, 
and 
most 
of 
all 
for 
the 
socialist 
state. 
Everything 
that 
the 
state 
is 
capable 
of 
doing 
it 
does 
by 
compulsion 
and 
the 
application 
of 
force. 
To 
suppress 
conduct 
dangerous 
to 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
social 
order 
is 
the 
sum 
and 
substance 
of 
state 
activity; 
to 
this 
is 
added, 
in 
a 
socialist 
community, 
control 
over 
the 
means 
of 
production. 


The 
sober 
logic 
of 
the 
Romans 
expressed 
this 
fact 
symbolically 
by 
adopting 
the 
axe 
and 
the 
bundle 
of 
rods 
as 
the 
emblem 
of 
the 
state. 
Abstruse 
mysticism, 
calling 
itself 
philosophy, 
has 
done 
as 
much 
as 
possible 
in 
modern 



times 
to 
obscure 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
matter. 
For 
Schelling, 
the 
state 
is 
the 
direct 
and 
visible 
image 
of 
absolute 
life, 
a 
phase 
in 
the 
revelation 
of 
the 
Absolute 
or 
World 
Soul. 
It 
exists 
only 
for 
its 
own 
sake, 
and 
its 
activity 
is 
directed 
exclusively 
to 
the 
maintenance 
of 
both 
the 
substance 
and 
the 
form 
of 
its 
existence. 
For 
Hegel, 
Absolute 
Reason 
reveals 
itself 
in 
the 
state, 
and 
Objective 
Spirit 
realizes 
itself 
in 
it. 
It 
is 
ethical 
mind 
developed 
into 
an 
organic 
reality—reality 
and 
the 
ethical 
idea 
as 
the 
revealed 
substantial 
will 
intelligible 
to 
itself. 
The 
epigones 
of 
idealist 
philosophy 
outdid 
even 
their 
masters 
in 
their 
deification 
of 
the 
state. 
To 
be 
sure, 
one 
comes 
no 
closer 
to 
the 
truth 
if, 
in 
reaction 
to 
these 
and 
similar 
doctrines, 
one 
calls 
the 
state, 
with 
Nietzsche, 
the 
coldest 
of 
all 
cold 
monsters. 
The 
state 
is 
neither 
cold 
nor 
warm, 
for 
it 
is 
an 
abstract 
concept 
in 
whose 
name 
living 
men—the 
organs 
of 
the 
state, 
the 
government—act. 
All 
state 
activity 
is 
human 
action, 
an 
evil 
inflicted 
by 
men 
on 
men. 
The 
goal—the 
preservation 
of 
society—justifies 
the 
action 
of 
the 
organs 
of 
the 
state, 
but 
the 
evils 
inflicted 
are 
not 
felt 
as 
any 
less 
evil 
by 
those 
who 
suffer 
under 
them. 


The 
evil 
that 
a 
man 
inflicts 
on 
his 
fellow 
man 
injures 
both—not 
only 
the 
one 
to 
whom 
it 
is 
done, 
but 
also 
the 
one 
who 
does 
it. 
Nothing 
corrupts 
a 
man 
so 
much 
as 
being 
an 
arm 
of 
the 
law 
and 
making 
men 
suffer. 
The 
lot 
of 
the 
subject 
is 
anxiety, 
a 
spirit 
of 
servility 
and 
fawning 
adulation; 
but 
the 
pharisaical 
self-righteousness, 
conceit, 
and 
arrogance 
of 
the 
master 
are 
no 
better. 


Liberalism 
seeks 
to 
take 
the 
sting 
out 
of 
the 
relationship 
of 
the 
government 
official 
to 
the 
citizen. 
In 
doing 
so, 
of 
course, 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
in 
the 
footsteps 
of 
those 
romantics 
who 
defend 
the 
antisocial 
behavior 
of 
the 
lawbreaker 
and 
condemn 
not 
only 
judges 
and 
policemen, 
but 
also 
the 
social 
order 
as 
such. 
Liberalism 
neither 
wishes 
to 
nor 
can 
deny 
that 
the 
coercive 
power 
of 
the 
state 
and 
the 
lawful 
punishment 
of 
criminals 
are 
institutions 
that 
society 
could 
never, 
under 
any 
circumstances, 
do 
without. 
However, 
the 
liberal 
believes 
that 
the 
purpose 
of 
punishment 
is 
solely 
to 
rule 
out, 
as 
far 
as 
possible, 
behavior 
dangerous 
to 
society. 
Punishment 
should 
not 
be 
vindictive 
or 
retaliatory. 
The 
criminal 
has 
incurred 
the 
penalties 
of 
the 
law, 
but 
not 
the 
hate 
and 
sadism 
of 
the 
judge, 
the 
policeman, 
and 
the 
ever 
lynch-thirsty 
mob. 


What 
is 
most 
mischievous 
about 
the 
coercive 
power 
that 
justifies 
itself 
in 
the 
name 
of 
the 
“state” 
is 
that, 
because 
it 
is 
always 
of 
necessity 
ultimately 
sustained 
by 
the 
consent 
of 
the 
majority, 
it 
directs 
its 
attack 
against 



germinating 
innovations. 
Human 
society 
cannot 
do 
without 
the 
apparatus 
of 
the 
state, 
but 
the 
whole 
of 
mankind’s 
progress 
has 
had 
to 
be 
achieved 
against 
the 
resistance 
and 
opposition 
of 
the 
state 
and 
its 
power 
of 
coercion. 
No 
wonder 
that 
all 
who 
have 
had 
something 
new 
to 
offer 
humanity 
have 
had 
nothing 
good 
to 
say 
of 
the 
state 
or 
its 
laws! 
Incorrigible 
etatist 
mystics 
and 
state-worshippers 
may 
hold 
this 
against 
them; 
liberals 
will 
understand 
their 
position 
even 
if 
they 
cannot 
approve 
it. 
Yet 
every 
liberal 
must 
oppose 
this 
understandable 
aversion 
to 
everything 
that 
pertains 
to 
jailers 
and 
policemen 
when 
it 
is 
carried 
to 
the 
point 
of 
such 
overweening 
self-esteem 
as 
to 
proclaim 
the 
right 
of 
the 
individual 
to 
rebel 
against 
the 
state. 
Violent 
resistance 
against 
the 
power 
of 
the 
state 
is 
the 
last 
resort 
of 
the 
minority 
in 
its 
effort 
to 
break 
loose 
from 
the 
oppression 
of 
the 
majority. 
The 
minority 
that 
desires 
to 
see 
its 
ideas 
triumph 
must 
strive 
by 
intellectual 
means 
to 
become 
the 
majority. 
The 
state 
must 
be 
so 
constituted 
that 
the 
scope 
of 
its 
laws 
permits 
the 
individual 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
latitude 
within 
which 
he 
can 
move 
freely. 
The 
citizen 
must 
not 
be 
so 
narrowly 
circumscribed 
in 
his 
activities 
that, 
if 
he 
thinks 
differently 
from 
those 
in 
power, 
his 
only 
choice 
is 
either 
to 
perish 
or 
to 
destroy 
the 
machinery 
of 
state.

Liberal 
Economic 
Policy 


1. 
The 
Organization 
of 
the 
Economy 
It 
is 
possible 
to 
distinguish 
five 
different 
conceivable 
systems 
of 
organizing 
the 
cooperation 
of 
individuals 
in 
a 
society 
based 
on 
the 
division 
of 
labor: 
the 
system 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
which, 
in 
its 
developed 
form, 
we 
call 
capitalism; 
the 
system 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
with 
periodic 
confiscation 
of 
all 
wealth 
and 
its 
subsequent 
redistribution; 
the 
system 
of 
syndicalism; 
the 
system 
of 
public 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
which 
is 
known 
as 
socialism 
or 
communism; 
and, 
finally, 
the 
system 
of 
interventionism. 


The 
history 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
coincides 
with 
the 
history 
of 
the 
development 
of 
mankind 
from 
an 
animal-like 
condition 
to 
the 
highest 
reaches 
of 
modern 
civilization. 
The 
opponents 
of 
private 
property 
have 
gone 
to 
great 
pains 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
in 
the 
primeval 
beginnings 
of 
human 
society 
the 
institution 
of 
private 
property 
still 
did 
not 
exist 
in 
a 
complete 
form 
because 
a 
part 
of 
the 
land 
under 
cultivation 
was 
subject 
to 
periodic 
redistribution. 
From 
this 
observation, 
which 
shows 
that 
private 
property 
is 
only 
a 
“historical 
category,” 
they 
have 
tried 
to 
draw 
the 
conclusion 
that 
it 
could 
once 
again 
be 
quite 
safely 
dispensed 
with. 
The 
logical 
fallacy 
involved 
in 
this 
reasoning 
is 
too 
flagrant 
to 
require 
any 
further 
discussion. 
That 
there 
was 
social 
cooperation 
in 
remote 
antiquity 
even 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
completely 
realized 
system 
of 
private 
property 
cannot 
provide 
the 
slightest 
proof 
that 
one 
could 
manage 
without 
private 
property 
just 
as 
well 
at 
higher 
stages 
of 
civilization. 
If 
history 
could 
prove 
anything 
at 
all 
in 
regard 
to 
this 
question, 
it 
could 
only 
be 
that 
nowhere 
and 
at 
no 
time 
has 
there 
ever 
been 
a 
people 
which 
has 
raised 
itself 
without 
private 
property 
above 
a 
condition 
of 
the 
most 
oppressive 
penury 
and 
savagery 
scarcely 
distinguishable 
from 
animal 
existence. 


The 
earlier 
opponents 
of 
the 
system 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 



of 
production 
did 
not 
attack 
the 
institution 
of 
private 
property 
as 
such, 
but 
only 
the 
inequality 
of 
income 
distribution. 
They 
recommended 
the 
abolition 
of 
the 
inequality 
of 
income 
and 
wealth 
by 
means 
of 
a 
system 
of 
periodical 
redistribution 
of 
the 
total 
quantity 
of 
commodities 
or, 
at 
least, 
of 
land, 
which 
was 
at 
that 
time 
virtually 
the 
only 
factor 
of 
production 
taken 
into 
consideration. 
In 
the 
technologically 
backward 
countries, 
where 
primitive 
agricultural 
production 
prevails, 
this 
idea 
of 
an 
equal 
distribution 
of 
property 
still 
holds 
sway 
today. 
People 
are 
accustomed 
to 
call 
it 
agrarian 
socialism, 
though 
the 
appellation 
is 
not 
at 
all 
apposite 
since 
this 
system 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
socialism. 
The 
Bolshevist 
revolution 
in 
Russia, 
which 
had 
begun 
as 
socialist, 
did 
not 
establish 
socialism 
in 
agriculture—i.e., 
communal 
ownership 
of 
the 
land—but, 
instead, 
agrarian 
socialism. 
In 
large 
areas 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
Eastern 
Europe, 
the 
division 
of 
big 
landed 
estates 
among 
the 
small 
farmers, 
under 
the 
name 
of 
agrarian 
reform, 
is 
the 
ideal 
espoused 
by 
influential 
political 
parties. 


It 
is 
unnecessary 
to 
enter 
further 
into 
a 
discussion 
of 
this 
system. 
That 
it 
must 
result 
in 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
output 
of 
human 
labor 
will 
scarcely 
be 
disputed. 
Only 
where 
land 
is 
still 
cultivated 
in 
the 
most 
primitive 
way 
can 
one 
fail 
to 
recognize 
the 
decrease 
in 
productivity 
which 
follows 
upon 
its 
division 
and 
distribution. 
That 
it 
is 
utterly 
senseless 
to 
break 
up 
a 
dairy 
farm 
equipped 
with 
all 
the 
devices 
of 
modern 
technology 
will 
be 
conceded 
by 
everyone. 
As 
for 
the 
transference 
of 
this 
principle 
of 
division 
and 
distribution 
to 
industry 
or 
commercial 
enterprises, 
it 
is 
altogether 
unthinkable. 
A 
railroad, 
a 
rolling 
mill, 
or 
a 
machine 
factory 
cannot 
be 
divided 
up. 
One 
could 
undertake 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
periodical 
redistribution 
of 
property 
only 
if 
one 
first 
completely 
broke 
up 
the 
economy 
based 
on 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
and 
the 
unhampered 
market 
and 
returned 
to 
an 
economy 
of 
self-sufficient 
farmsteads 
existing 
side 
by 
side 
without 
engaging 
in 
exchange. 


The 
idea 
of 
syndicalism 
represents 
the 
attempt 
to 
adapt 
the 
ideal 
of 
the 
equal 
distribution 
of 
property 
to 
the 
circumstances 
of 
modern 
large-scale 
industry. 
Syndicalism 
seeks 
to 
invest 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
neither 
in 
individuals 
nor 
in 
society, 
but 
in 
the 
workers 
employed 
in 
each 
industry 
or 
branch 
of 
production.[1] 


Since 
the 
proportion 
in 
which 
the 
material 
and 
the 
personal 
factors 
of 
production 
are 
combined 
is 
different 
in 
the 
different 
branches 
of 
production, 
equality 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
property 
cannot 
be 
attained 
in 
this 
way 
at 
all. 



From 
the 
very 
outset 
the 
worker 
will 
receive 
a 
greater 
portion 
of 
property 
in 
some 
branches 
of 
industry 
than 
in 
others. 
One 
has 
only 
to 
consider 
the 
difficulties 
that 
must 
arise 
from 
the 
necessity, 
continually 
present 
in 
any 
economy, 
of 
shifting 
capital 
and 
labor 
from 
one 
branch 
of 
production 
to 
another. 
Will 
it 
be 
possible 
to 
withdraw 
capital 
from 
one 
branch 
of 
industry 
in 
order 
thereby 
more 
generously 
to 
equip 
another? 
Will 
it 
be 
possible 
to 
remove 
workers 
from 
one 
branch 
of 
production 
in 
order 
to 
transfer 
them 
to 
another 
where 
the 
quota 
of 
capital 
per 
worker 
is 
smaller? 
The 
impossibility 
of 
such 
transfers 
renders 
the 
syndicalist 
commonwealth 
utterly 
absurd 
and 
impracticable 
as 
a 
form 
of 
social 
organization. 
Yet 
if 
we 
assume 
that 
over 
and 
above 
the 
individual 
groups 
there 
exists 
a 
central 
power 
that 
is 
entitled 
to 
carry 
out 
such 
transfers, 
we 
are 
no 
longer 
dealing 
with 
syndicalism, 
but 
with 
socialism. 
In 
reality, 
syndicalism 
as 
a 
social 
ideal 
is 
so 
absurd 
that 
only 
muddleheads 
who 
have 
not 
sufficiently 
thought 
the 
problem 
through 
have 
ventured 
to 
advocate 
it 
on 
principle. 


Socialism 
or 
communism 
is 
that 
organization 
of 
society 
in 
which 
property—the 
power 
of 
deploying 
all 
the 
means 
of 
production—is 
vested 
in 
society, 
i.e., 
in 
the 
state, 
as 
the 
social 
apparatus 
of 
compulsion 
and 
coercion. 
For 
a 
society 
to 
be 
judged 
as 
socialist 
it 
is 
of 
no 
consequence 
whether 
the 
social 
dividend 
is 
distributed 
equally 
or 
according 
to 
some 
other 
principle. 
Neither 
is 
it 
of 
decisive 
significance 
whether 
socialism 
is 
brought 
about 
by 
a 
formal 
transfer 
of 
the 
ownership 
of 
all 
the 
means 
of 
production 
to 
the 
state, 
the 
social 
apparatus 
of 
compulsion 
and 
coercion, 
or 
whether 
the 
private 
owners 
retain 
their 
property 
in 
name 
and 
the 
socialization 
consists 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
all 
these 
“owners” 
are 
entitled 
to 
employ 
the 
means 
of 
production 
left 
in 
their 
hands 
only 
according 
to 
instructions 
issued 
by 
the 
state. 
If 
the 
government 
decides 
what 
is 
to 
be 
produced 
and 
how, 
and 
to 
whom 
it 
is 
to 
be 
sold, 
and 
at 
what 
“price,” 
then 
private 
property 
still 
exists 
in 
name 
only; 
in 
reality, 
all 
property 
is 
already 
socialized, 
for 
the 
mainspring 
of 
economic 
activity 
is 
no 
longer 
profit-seeking 
on 
the 
part 
of 
entrepreneurs 
and 
capitalists, 
but 
the 
necessity 
of 
fulfilling 
an 
imposed 
duty 
and 
of 
obeying 
commands. 


Finally, 
we 
still 
have 
to 
speak 
of 
interventionism. 
According 
to 
a 
widespread 
opinion, 
there 
is, 
midway 
between 
socialism 
and 
capitalism, 
a 
third 
possibility 
of 
social 
organization: 
the 
system 
of 
private 
property 
regulated, 
controlled, 
and 
guided 
by 
isolated 
authoritarian 
decrees 
(acts 
of 



intervention). 


The 
system 
of 
periodical 
redistribution 
of 
property 
and 
the 
system 
of 
syndicalism 
will 
not 
be 
discussed 
in 
what 
follows. 
These 
two 
systems 
are 
not 
generally 
at 
issue. 
No 
one 
who 
is 
in 
any 
way 
to 
be 
taken 
seriously 
advocates 
either 
one. 
We 
have 
to 
concern 
ourselves 
only 
with 
socialism, 
interventionism, 
and 
capitalism. 


2. 
Private 
Property 
and 
Its 
Critics 
Man’s 
life 
is 
not 
a 
state 
of 
unalloyed 
happiness. 
The 
earth 
is 
no 
paradise. 
Although 
this 
is 
not 
the 
fault 
of 
social 
institutions, 
people 
are 
wont 
to 
hold 
them 
responsible 
for 
it. 
The 
foundation 
of 
any 
and 
every 
civilization, 
including 
our 
own, 
is 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
Whoever 
wishes 
to 
criticize 
modern 
civilization, 
therefore, 
begins 
with 
private 
property. 
It 
is 
blamed 
for 
everything 
that 
does 
not 
please 
the 
critic, 
especially 
those 
evils 
that 
have 
their 
origin 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
private 
property 
has 
been 
hampered 
and 
restrained 
in 
various 
respects 
so 
that 
its 
full 
social 
potentialities 
cannot 
be 
realized. 


The 
usual 
procedure 
adopted 
by 
the 
critic 
is 
to 
imagine 
how 
wonderful 
everything 
would 
be 
if 
only 
he 
had 
his 
own 
way. 
In 
his 
dreams 
he 
eliminates 
every 
will 
opposed 
to 
his 
own 
by 
raising 
himself, 
or 
someone 
whose 
will 
coincides 
exactly 
with 
his, 
to 
the 
position 
of 
absolute 
master 
of 
the 
world. 
Everyone 
who 
preaches 
the 
right 
of 
the 
stronger 
considers 
himself 
as 
the 
stronger. 
He 
who 
espouses 
the 
institution 
of 
slavery 
never 
stops 
to 
reflect 
that 
he 
himself 
could 
be 
a 
slave. 
He 
who 
demands 
restrictions 
on 
the 
liberty 
of 
conscience 
demands 
it 
in 
regard 
to 
others, 
and 
not 
for 
himself. 
He 
who 
advocates 
an 
oligarchic 
form 
of 
government 
always 
includes 
himself 
in 
the 
oligarchy, 
and 
he 
who 
goes 
into 
ecstasies 
at 
the 
thought 
of 
enlightened 
despotism 
or 
dictatorship 
is 
immodest 
enough 
to 
allot 
to 
himself, 
in 
his 
daydreams, 
the 
role 
of 
the 
enlightened 
despot 
or 
dictator, 
or, 
at 
least, 
to 
expect 
that 
he 
himself 
will 
become 
the 
despot 
over 
the 
despot 
or 
the 
dictator 
over 
the 
dictator. 
Just 
as 
no 
one 
desires 
to 
see 
himself 
in 
the 
position 
of 
the 
weaker, 
of 
the 
oppressed, 
of 
the 
overpowered, 
of 
the 
negatively 
privileged, 
of 
the 
subject 
without 
rights; 
so, 
under 
socialism, 
no 
one 
desires 
himself 
otherwise 
than 
in 
the 
role 
of 
the 
general 
director 
or 
the 
mentor 
of 
the 
general 
director. 
In 
the 
dream 
and 
wish 
fantasies 
of 
socialism 
there 
is 
no 
other 
life 



that 
would 
be 
worth 
living. 


Anticapitalist 
literature 
has 
created 
a 
fixed 
pattern 
for 
these 
fantasies 
of 
the 
daydreamer 
in 
the 
customary 
opposition 
between 
profitability 
and 
productivity. 
What 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
capitalist 
social 
order 
is 
contrasted 
in 
thought 
with 
what—corresponding 
to 
the 
desires 
of 
the 
critic—would 
be 
accomplished 
in 
the 
ideal 
socialist 
society. 
Everything 
that 
deviates 
from 
this 
ideal 
image 
is 
characterized 
as 
unproductive. 
That 
the 
greatest 
profitability 
for 
private 
individuals 
and 
the 
greatest 
productivity 
for 
the 
community 
do 
not 
always 
coincide 
was 
long 
considered 
the 
most 
serious 
reproach 
against 
the 
capitalist 
system. 
Only 
in 
recent 
years 
has 
the 
knowledge 
gained 
ground 
that 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
these 
cases 
a 
socialist 
community 
could 
proceed 
no 
differently 
from 
the 
way 
individuals 
in 
a 
capitalist 
community 
do. 
But 
even 
where 
the 
alleged 
opposition 
actually 
does 
exist, 
it 
cannot 
simply 
be 
assumed 
that 
a 
socialist 
society 
would 
necessarily 
do 
what 
is 
right 
and 
that 
the 
capitalist 
social 
order 
is 
always 
to 
be 
condemned 
if 
it 
does 
anything 
else. 
The 
concept 
of 
productivity 
is 
altogether 
subjective; 
it 
can 
never 
provide 
the 
starting-point 
for 
an 
objective 
criticism. 


It 
is 
not 
worth 
while, 
therefore, 
to 
concern 
ourselves 
with 
the 
musings 
of 
our 
daydream-dictator. 
In 
his 
dream 
vision, 
everyone 
is 
willing 
and 
obedient, 
ready 
to 
execute 
his 
commands 
immediately 
and 
punctiliously. 
But 
it 
is 
quite 
another 
question 
how 
things 
must 
appear 
in 
a 
real, 
and 
not 
merely 
visionary, 
socialist 
society. 
The 
assumption 
that 
the 
equal 
distribution 
of 
the 
total 
annual 
output 
of 
the 
capitalist 
economy 
among 
all 
members 
of 
society 
would 
suffice 
to 
assure 
everyone 
a 
sufficient 
livelihood 
is, 
as 
simple 
statistical 
calculations 
show, 
altogether 
false. 
Thus, 
a 
socialist 
society 
could 
scarcely 
achieve 
a 
perceptible 
increase 
in 
the 
standard 
of 
living 
of 
the 
masses 
in 
this 
way. 
If 
it 
holds 
out 
the 
prospect 
of 
well-being, 
and 
even 
riches, 
for 
all, 
it 
can 
do 
so 
only 
on 
the 
assumption 
that 
labor 
in 
a 
socialist 
society 
will 
be 
more 
productive 
than 
it 
is 
under 
capitalism 
and 
that 
a 
socialist 
system 
will 
be 
able 
to 
dispense 
with 
a 
number 
of 
superfluous—and 
consequently 
unproductive— 
expenditures. 


In 
connection 
with 
this 
second 
point, 
one 
thinks, 
for 
example, 
of 
the 
abolition 
of 
all 
those 
expenses 
originating 
in 
the 
costs 
of 
marketing 
merchandise, 
of 
competition, 
and 
of 
advertising. 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
there 
is 
no 
room 
in 
a 
socialist 
community 
for 
such 
expenditures. 
Yet 
one 
must 
not 
forget 
that 
the 
socialist 
apparatus 
of 
distribution 
too 
will 
involve 
not 
inconsiderable 



costs, 
perhaps 
even 
greater 
than 
those 
of 
a 
capitalist 
economy. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
the 
decisive 
element 
in 
our 
judgment 
of 
the 
significance 
of 
these 
expenses. 
The 
socialist 
assumes, 
without 
question, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
course, 
that 
in 
a 
socialist 
system 
the 
productivity 
of 
labor 
will 
be 
at 
least 
the 
same 
as 
in 
a 
capitalist 
society, 
and 
he 
seeks 
to 
prove 
that 
it 
will 
be 
even 
greater. 
But 
the 
first 
assumption 
is 
by 
no 
means 
as 
self-evident 
as 
the 
advocates 
of 
socialism 
seem 
to 
think. 
The 
quantity 
of 
things 
produced 
in 
a 
capitalist 
society 
is 
not 
independent 
of 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
production 
is 
carried 
on. 
What 
is 
of 
decisive 
significance 
is 
that 
at 
every 
single 
stage 
of 
each 
branch 
of 
production 
the 
special 
interest 
of 
the 
persons 
engaged 
in 
it 
is 
bound 
up 
most 
intimately 
with 
the 
productivity 
of 
the 
particular 
share 
of 
labor 
being 
performed. 
Every 
worker 
must 
exert 
himself 
to 
the 
utmost, 
since 
his 
wages 
are 
determined 
by 
the 
output 
of 
his 
labor, 
and 
every 
entrepreneur 
must 
strive 
to 
produce 
more 
cheaply—i.e., 
with 
less 
expenditure 
of 
capital 
and 
labor—than 
his 
competitors. 


Only 
because 
of 
these 
incentives 
has 
the 
capitalist 
economy 
been 
able 
to 
produce 
the 
wealth 
that 
is 
at 
its 
command. 
To 
take 
exception 
to 
the 
alleged 
excessive 
costs 
of 
the 
capitalist 
marketing 
apparatus 
is 
to 
take 
a 
myopic 
view 
of 
things 
indeed. 
Whoever 
reproaches 
capitalism 
with 
squandering 
resources 
because 
there 
are 
many 
competing 
haberdashers 
and 
even 
more 
tobacconists 
to 
be 
found 
on 
bustling 
business 
streets 
fails 
to 
see 
that 
this 
sales 
organization 
is 
only 
the 
end 
result 
of 
an 
apparatus 
of 
production 
that 
warrants 
the 
greatest 
productivity 
of 
labor. 
All 
advances 
in 
production 
have 
been 
achieved 
only 
because 
it 
is 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
this 
apparatus 
continually 
to 
make 
advances. 
Only 
because 
all 
entrepreneurs 
are 
in 
constant 
competition 
and 
are 
mercilessly 
weeded 
out 
if 
they 
do 
not 
produce 
in 
the 
most 
profitable 
manner 
are 
methods 
of 
production 
perpetually 
being 
improved 
and 
refined. 
Were 
this 
incentive 
to 
disappear, 
there 
would 
be 
no 
further 
progress 
in 
production 
and 
no 
effort 
to 
economize 
in 
the 
application 
of 
the 
traditional 
methods. 
Consequently, 
it 
is 
completely 
absurd 
to 
pose 
the 
question 
how 
much 
could 
be 
saved 
if 
the 
costs 
of 
advertising 
were 
abolished. 
One 
must 
rather 
ask 
how 
much 
could 
be 
produced 
if 
competition 
among 
producers 
were 
abolished. 
The 
answer 
to 
this 
question 
cannot 
be 
in 
doubt. 


Men 
can 
consume 
only 
if 
they 
labor, 
and 
then 
only 
as 
much 
as 
their 
labor 
has 
produced. 
Now 
it 
is 
the 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
the 
capitalist 
system 
that 
it 
provides 
each 
member 
of 
society 
with 
this 
incentive 
to 
carry 
on 



his 
work 
with 
the 
greatest 
efficiency 
and 
thus 
achieves 
the 
highest 
output. 
In 
a 
socialist 
society, 
this 
direct 
connection 
between 
the 
labor 
of 
the 
individual 
and 
the 
goods 
and 
services 
he 
might 
thereby 
enjoy 
would 
be 
lacking. 
The 
incentive 
to 
work 
would 
not 
consist 
in 
the 
possibility 
of 
enjoying 
the 
fruit 
of 
one’s 
labor, 
but 
in 
the 
command 
of 
the 
authorities 
to 
work 
and 
in 
one’s 
own 
feeling 
of 
duty. 
The 
precise 
demonstration 
that 
this 
organization 
of 
labor 
is 
unfeasible 
will 
be 
offered 
in 
a 
later 
chapter. 


What 
is 
always 
criticized 
in 
the 
capitalist 
system 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
owners 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
occupy 
a 
preferential 
position. 
They 
can 
live 
without 
working. 
If 
one 
views 
the 
social 
order 
from 
an 
individualistic 
standpoint, 
one 
must 
see 
in 
this 
a 
serious 
shortcoming 
of 
capitalism. 
Why 
should 
one 
man 
be 
better 
off 
than 
another? 
But 
whoever 
considers 
things, 
not 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
individual 
persons, 
but 
from 
that 
of 
the 
whole 
social 
order, 
will 
find 
that 
the 
owners 
of 
property 
can 
preserve 
their 
agreeable 
position 
solely 
on 
condition 
that 
they 
perform 
a 
service 
indispensable 
for 
society. 
The 
capitalist 
can 
keep 
his 
favored 
position 
only 
by 
shifting 
the 
means 
of 
production 
to 
the 
application 
most 
important 
for 
society. 
If 
he 
does 
not 
do 
this—if 
he 
invests 
his 
wealth 
unwisely—he 
will 
suffer 
losses, 
and 
if 
he 
does 
not 
correct 
his 
mistake 
in 
time, 
he 
will 
soon 
be 
ruthlessly 
ousted 
from 
his 
preferential 
position. 
He 
will 
cease 
to 
be 
a 
capitalist, 
and 
others 
who 
are 
better 
qualified 
for 
it 
will 
take 
his 
place. 
In 
a 
capitalist 
society, 
the 
deployment 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
is 
always 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
those 
best 
fitted 
for 
it; 
and 
whether 
they 
want 
to 
or 
not, 
they 
must 
constantly 
take 
care 
to 
employ 
the 
means 
of 
production 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
they 
yield 
the 
greatest 
output. 


3. 
Private 
Property 
and 
the 
Government 
All 
those 
in 
positions 
of 
political 
power, 
all 
governments, 
all 
kings, 
and 
all 
republican 
authorities 
have 
always 
looked 
askance 
at 
private 
property. 
There 
is 
an 
inherent 
tendency 
in 
all 
governmental 
power 
to 
recognize 
no 
restraints 
on 
its 
operation 
and 
to 
extend 
the 
sphere 
of 
its 
dominion 
as 
much 
as 
possible. 
To 
control 
everything, 
to 
leave 
no 
room 
for 
anything 
to 
happen 
of 
its 
own 
accord 
without 
the 
interference 
of 
the 
authorities—this 
is 
the 
goal 
for 
which 
every 
ruler 
secretly 
strives. 
If 
only 
private 
property 
did 
not 
stand 
in 
the 
way! 
Private 
property 
creates 
for 
the 
individual 
a 
sphere 
in 
which 
he 
is 
free 
of 



the 
state. 
It 
sets 
limits 
to 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
authoritarian 
will. 
It 
allows 
other 
forces 
to 
arise 
side 
by 
side 
with 
and 
in 
opposition 
to 
political 
power. 
It 
thus 
becomes 
the 
basis 
of 
all 
those 
activities 
that 
are 
free 
from 
violent 
interference 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
state. 
It 
is 
the 
soil 
in 
which 
the 
seeds 
of 
freedom 
are 
nurtured 
and 
in 
which 
the 
autonomy 
of 
the 
individual 
and 
ultimately 
all 
intellectual 
and 
material 
progress 
are 
rooted. 
In 
this 
sense, 
it 
has 
even 
been 
called 
the 
fundamental 
prerequisite 
for 
the 
development 
of 
the 
individual. 
But 
it 
is 
only 
with 
many 
reservations 
that 
the 
latter 
formulation 
can 
be 
considered 
acceptable, 
because 
the 
customary 
opposition 
between 
individual 
and 
collectivity, 
between 
individualistic 
and 
collective 
ideas 
and 
aims, 
or 
even 
between 
individualistic 
and 
universalistic 
science, 
is 
an 
empty 
shibboleth. 


Thus, 
there 
has 
never 
been 
a 
political 
power 
that 
voluntarily 
desisted 
from 
impeding 
the 
free 
development 
and 
operation 
of 
the 
institution 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
Governments 
tolerate 
private 
property 
when 
they 
are 
compelled 
to 
do 
so, 
but 
they 
do 
not 
acknowledge 
it 
voluntarily 
in 
recognition 
of 
its 
necessity. 
Even 
liberal 
politicians, 
on 
gaining 
power, 
have 
usually 
relegated 
their 
liberal 
principles 
more 
or 
less 
to 
the 
background. 
The 
tendency 
to 
impose 
oppressive 
restraints 
on 
private 
property, 
to 
abuse 
political 
power, 
and 
to 
refuse 
to 
respect 
or 
recognize 
any 
free 
sphere 
outside 
or 
beyond 
the 
dominion 
of 
the 
state 
is 
too 
deeply 
ingrained 
in 
the 
mentality 
of 
those 
who 
control 
the 
governmental 
apparatus 
of 
compulsion 
and 
coercion 
for 
them 
ever 
to 
be 
able 
to 
resist 
it 
voluntarily. 
A 
liberal 
government 
is 
a 
contradictio 
in 
adjecto. 
Governments 
must 
be 
forced 
into 
adopting 
liberalism 
by 
the 
power 
of 
the 
unanimous 
opinion 
of 
the 
people; 
that 
they 
could 
voluntarily 
become 
liberal 
is 
not 
to 
be 
expected. 


It 
is 
easy 
to 
understand 
what 
would 
constrain 
rulers 
to 
recognize 
the 
property 
rights 
of 
their 
subjects 
in 
a 
society 
composed 
exclusively 
of 
farmers 
all 
of 
whom 
were 
equally 
rich. 
In 
such 
a 
social 
order, 
every 
attempt 
to 
abridge 
the 
right 
to 
property 
would 
immediately 
meet 
with 
the 
resistance 
of 
a 
united 
front 
of 
all 
subjects 
against 
the 
government 
and 
thus 
bring 
about 
the 
latter’s 
fall. 
The 
situation 
is 
essentially 
different, 
however, 
in 
a 
society 
in 
which 
there 
is 
not 
only 
agricultural 
but 
also 
industrial 
production, 
and 
especially 
where 
there 
are 
big 
business 
enterprises 
involving 
large-scale 
investments 
in 
industry, 
mining, 
and 
trade. 
In 
such 
a 
society, 
it 
is 
quite 
possible 
for 
those 
in 
control 
of 
the 
government 
to 
take 
action 
against 
private 
property. 
In 
fact, 
politically 
there 
is 
nothing 
more 
advantageous 
for 
a 



government 
than 
an 
attack 
on 
property 
rights, 
for 
it 
is 
always 
an 
easy 
matter 
to 
incite 
the 
masses 
against 
the 
owners 
of 
land 
and 
capital. 
From 
time 
immemorial, 
therefore, 
it 
has 
been 
the 
idea 
of 
all 
absolute 
monarchs, 
of 
all 
despots 
and 
tyrants, 
to 
ally 
themselves 
with 
the 
“people” 
against 
the 
propertied 
classes. 
The 
Second 
Empire 
of 
Louis 
Napoleon 
was 
not 
the 
only 
regime 
to 
be 
founded 
on 
the 
principle 
of 
Caesarism. 
The 
Prussian 
authoritarian 
state 
of 
the 
Hohenzollerns 
also 
took 
up 
the 
idea, 
introduced 
by 
Lassalle 
into 
German 
politics 
during 
the 
Prussian 
constitutional 
struggle, 
of 
winning 
the 
masses 
of 
workers 
to 
the 
battle 
against 
the 
liberal 
bourgeoisie 
by 
means 
of 
a 
policy 
of 
etatism 
and 
interventionism. 
This 
was 
the 
basic 
principle 
of 
the 
“social 
monarchy” 
so 
highly 
extolled 
by 
Schmoller 
and 
his 
school. 


In 
spite 
of 
all 
persecutions, 
however, 
the 
institution 
of 
private 
property 
has 
survived. 
Neither 
the 
animosity 
of 
all 
governments, 
nor 
the 
hostile 
campaign 
waged 
against 
it 
by 
writers 
and 
moralists 
and 
by 
churches 
and 
religions, 
nor 
the 
resentment 
of 
the 
masses—itself 
deeply 
rooted 
in 
instinctive 
envy—has 
availed 
to 
abolish 
it. 
Every 
attempt 
to 
replace 
it 
with 
some 
other 
method 
of 
organizing 
production 
and 
distribution 
has 
always 
of 
itself 
promptly 
proved 
unfeasible 
to 
the 
point 
of 
absurdity. 
People 
have 
had 
to 
recognize 
that 
the 
institution 
of 
private 
property 
is 
indispensable 
and 
to 
revert 
to 
it 
whether 
they 
liked 
it 
or 
not. 


But 
for 
all 
that, 
they 
have 
still 
refused 
to 
admit 
that 
the 
reason 
for 
this 
return 
to 
the 
institution 
of 
free 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
an 
economic 
system 
serving 
the 
needs 
and 
purposes 
of 
man’s 
life 
in 
society 
is, 
in 
principle, 
impracticable 
except 
on 
this 
foundation. 
People 
have 
been 
unable 
to 
make 
up 
their 
minds 
to 
rid 
themselves 
of 
an 
ideology 
to 
which 
they 
have 
become 
attached, 
namely, 
the 
belief 
that 
private 
property 
is 
an 
evil 
that 
cannot, 
at 
least 
for 
the 
time 
being, 
be 
dispensed 
with 
as 
long 
as 
men 
have 
not 
yet 
sufficiently 
evolved 
ethically. 
While 
governments—contrary 
to 
their 
intentions, 
of 
course, 
and 
to 
the 
inherent 
tendency 
of 
every 
organized 
center 
of 
power—have 
reconciled 
themselves 
to 
the 
existence 
of 
private 
property, 
they 
have 
still 
continued 
to 
adhere 
firmly—not 
only 
outwardly, 
but 
also 
in 
their 
own 
thinking—to 
an 
ideology 
hostile 
to 
property 
rights. 
Indeed, 
they 
consider 
opposition 
to 
private 
property 
to 
be 
correct 
in 
principle 
and 
any 
deviation 
from 
it 
on 
their 
part 
to 
be 
due 
solely 
to 
their 
own 
weakness 
or 
to 
consideration 
for 
the 
interests 
of 
powerful 
groups. 



4. 
The 
Impracticability 
of 
Socialism 
People 
are 
wont 
to 
consider 
socialism 
impracticable 
because 
they 
think 
that 
men 
lack 
the 
moral 
qualities 
demanded 
by 
a 
socialist 
society. 
It 
is 
feared 
that 
under 
socialism 
most 
men 
will 
not 
exhibit 
the 
same 
zeal 
in 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
duties 
and 
tasks 
assigned 
to 
them 
that 
they 
bring 
to 
their 
daily 
work 
in 
a 
social 
order 
based 
on 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
In 
a 
capitalist 
society, 
every 
individual 
knows 
that 
the 
fruit 
of 
his 
labor 
is 
his 
own 
to 
enjoy, 
that 
his 
income 
increases 
or 
decreases 
according 
as 
the 
output 
of 
his 
labor 
is 
greater 
or 
smaller. 
In 
a 
socialist 
society, 
every 
individual 
will 
think 
that 
less 
depends 
on 
the 
efficiency 
of 
his 
own 
labor, 
since 
a 
fixed 
portion 
of 
the 
total 
output 
is 
due 
him 
in 
any 
case 
and 
the 
amount 
of 
the 
latter 
cannot 
be 
appreciably 
diminished 
by 
the 
loss 
resulting 
from 
the 
laziness 
of 
any 
one 
man. 
If, 
as 
is 
to 
be 
feared, 
such 
a 
conviction 
should 
become 
general, 
the 
productivity 
of 
labor 
in 
a 
socialist 
community 
would 
drop 
considerably. 


The 
objection 
thus 
raised 
against 
socialism 
is 
completely 
sound, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
get 
to 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
matter. 
Were 
it 
possible 
in 
a 
socialist 
community 
to 
ascertain 
the 
output 
of 
the 
labor 
of 
every 
individual 
comrade 
with 
the 
same 
precision 
with 
which 
this 
is 
accomplished 
for 
each 
worker 
by 
means 
of 
economic 
calculation 
in 
the 
capitalist 
system, 
the 
practicability 
of 
socialism 
would 
not 
be 
dependent 
on 
the 
good 
will 
of 
every 
individual. 
Society 
would 
be 
in 
a 
position, 
at 
least 
within 
certain 
limits, 
to 
determine 
the 
share 
of 
the 
total 
output 
to 
be 
allotted 
to 
each 
worker 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
extent 
of 
his 
contribution 
to 
production. 
What 
renders 
socialism 
impracticable 
is 
precisely 
the 
fact 
that 
calculation 
of 
this 
kind 
is 
impossible 
in 
a 
socialist 
society. 


In 
the 
capitalist 
system, 
the 
calculation 
of 
profitability 
constitutes 
a 
guide 
that 
indicates 
to 
the 
individual 
whether 
the 
enterprise 
he 
is 
operating 
ought, 
under 
the 
given 
circumstances, 
to 
be 
in 
operation 
at 
all 
and 
whether 
it 
is 
being 
run 
in 
the 
most 
efficient 
possible 
way, 
i.e., 
at 
the 
least 
cost 
in 
factors 
of 
production. 
If 
an 
undertaking 
proves 
unprofitable, 
this 
means 
that 
the 
raw 
materials, 
half-finished 
goods, 
and 
labor 
that 
are 
needed 
in 
it 
are 
employed 
by 
other 
enterprises 
for 
an 
end 
that, 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
the 
consumers, 
is 
more 
urgent 
and 
more 
important, 
or 
for 
the 
same 
end, 
but 
in 
a 
more 



economical 
manner 
(i.e., 
with 
a 
smaller 
expenditure 
of 
capital 
and 
labor). 
When, 
for 
instance, 
hand 
weaving 
came 
to 
be 
unprofitable, 
this 
signified 
that 
the 
capital 
and 
labor 
employed 
in 
weaving 
by 
machine 
yield 
a 
greater 
output 
and 
that 
it 
is 
consequently 
uneconomical 
to 
adhere 
to 
a 
method 
of 
production 
in 
which 
the 
same 
input 
of 
capital 
and 
labor 
yields 
a 
smaller 
output. 


If 
a 
new 
enterprise 
is 
being 
planned, 
one 
can 
calculate 
in 
advance 
whether 
it 
can 
be 
made 
profitable 
at 
all 
and 
in 
what 
way. 
If, 
for 
example, 
one 
has 
the 
intention 
of 
constructing 
a 
railroad 
line, 
one 
can, 
by 
estimating 
the 
traffic 
to 
be 
expected 
and 
its 
ability 
to 
pay 
the 
freight 
rates, 
calculate 
whether 
it 
pays 
to 
invest 
capital 
and 
labor 
in 
such 
an 
undertaking. 
If 
the 
result 
of 
this 
calculation 
shows 
that 
the 
projected 
railroad 
promises 
no 
profit, 
this 
is 
tantamount 
to 
saying 
that 
there 
is 
other, 
more 
urgent 
employment 
for 
the 
capital 
and 
the 
labor 
that 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
railroad 
would 
require; 
the 
world 
is 
not 
yet 
rich 
enough 
to 
be 
able 
to 
afford 
such 
an 
expenditure. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
only 
when 
the 
question 
arises 
whether 
or 
not 
a 
given 
undertaking 
is 
to 
be 
begun 
at 
all 
that 
the 
calculation 
of 
value 
and 
profitability 
is 
decisive; 
it 
controls 
every 
single 
step 
that 
the 
entrepreneur 
takes 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
his 
business. 


Capitalist 
economic 
calculation, 
which 
alone 
makes 
rational 
production 
possible, 
is 
based 
on 
monetary 
calculation. 
Only 
because 
the 
prices 
of 
all 
goods 
and 
services 
in 
the 
market 
can 
be 
expressed 
in 
terms 
of 
money 
is 
it 
possible 
for 
them, 
in 
spite 
of 
their 
heterogeneity, 
to 
enter 
into 
a 
calculation 
involving 
homogeneous 
units 
of 
measurement. 
In 
a 
socialist 
society, 
where 
all 
the 
means 
of 
production 
are 
owned 
by 
the 
community, 
and 
where, 
consequently, 
there 
is 
no 
market 
and 
no 
exchange 
of 
productive 
goods 
and 
services, 
there 
can 
also 
be 
no 
money 
prices 
for 
goods 
and 
services 
of 
higher 
order. 
Such 
a 
social 
system 
would 
thus, 
of 
necessity, 
be 
lacking 
in 
the 
means 
for 
the 
rational 
management 
of 
business 
enterprises, 
viz., 
economic 
calculation. 
For 
economic 
calculation 
cannot 
take 
place 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
common 
denominator 
to 
which 
all 
the 
heterogeneous 
goods 
and 
services 
can 
be 
reduced. 


Let 
us 
consider 
a 
quite 
simple 
case. 
For 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
railroad 
from 
A 
to 
B 
several 
routes 
are 
conceivable. 
Let 
us 
suppose 
that 
a 
mountain 
stands 
between 
A 
and 
B. 
The 
railroad 
can 
be 
made 
to 
run 
over 
the 
mountain, 
around 
the 
mountain, 
or, 
by 
way 
of 
a 
tunnel, 
through 
the 
mountain. 
In 
a 
capitalist 
society, 
it 
is 
a 
very 
easy 
matter 
to 
compute 
which 
line 
will 
prove 
the 



most 
profitable. 
One 
ascertains 
the 
cost 
involved 
in 
constructing 
each 
of 
the 
three 
lines 
and 
the 
differences 
in 
operating 
costs 
necessarily 
incurred 
by 
the 
anticipated 
traffic 
on 
each. 
From 
these 
quantities 
it 
is 
not 
difficult 
to 
determine 
which 
stretch 
of 
road 
will 
be 
the 
most 
profitable. 
A 
socialist 
society 
could 
not 
make 
such 
calculations. 
For 
it 
would 
have 
no 
possible 
way 
of 
reducing 
to 
a 
uniform 
standard 
of 
measurement 
all 
the 
heterogeneous 
quantities 
and 
qualities 
of 
goods 
and 
services 
that 
here 
come 
into 
consideration. 
In 
the 
face 
of 
the 
ordinary, 
everyday 
problems 
which 
the 
management 
of 
an 
economy 
presents, 
a 
socialist 
society 
would 
stand 
helpless, 
for 
it 
would 
have 
no 
possible 
way 
of 
keeping 
its 
accounts. 


The 
prosperity 
that 
has 
made 
it 
possible 
for 
many 
more 
people 
to 
inhabit 
the 
earth 
today 
than 
in 
the 
precapitalist 
era 
is 
due 
solely 
to 
the 
capitalist 
method 
of 
lengthy 
chains 
of 
production, 
which 
necessarily 
requires 
monetary 
calculation. 
This 
is 
impossible 
under 
socialism. 
In 
vain 
have 
socialist 
writers 
labored 
to 
demonstrate 
how 
one 
could 
still 
manage 
even 
without 
monetary 
and 
price 
calculation. 
All 
their 
efforts 
in 
this 
respect 
have 
met 
with 
failure. 


The 
leadership 
of 
a 
socialist 
society 
would 
thus 
be 
confronted 
by 
a 
problem 
that 
it 
could 
not 
possibly 
solve. 
It 
would 
not 
be 
able 
to 
decide 
which 
of 
the 
innumerable 
possible 
modes 
of 
procedure 
is 
the 
most 
rational. 
The 
resulting 
chaos 
in 
the 
economy 
would 
culminate 
quickly 
and 
irresistibly 
in 
universal 
impoverishment 
and 
a 
retrogression 
to 
the 
primitive 
conditions 
under 
which 
our 
ancestors 
once 
lived. 


The 
socialist 
ideal, 
carried 
to 
its 
logical 
conclusion, 
would 
eventuate 
in 
a 
social 
order 
in 
which 
all 
the 
means 
of 
production 
were 
owned 
by 
the 
people 
as 
a 
whole. 
Production 
would 
be 
completely 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
government, 
the 
center 
of 
power 
in 
society. 
It 
alone 
would 
determine 
what 
was 
to 
be 
produced 
and 
how, 
and 
in 
what 
way 
goods 
ready 
for 
consumption 
were 
to 
be 
distributed. 
It 
makes 
little 
difference 
whether 
we 
imagine 
this 
socialist 
state 
of 
the 
future 
as 
democratically 
constituted 
or 
otherwise. 
Even 
a 
democratic 
socialist 
state 
would 
necessarily 
constitute 
a 
tightly 
organized 
bureaucracy 
in 
which 
everyone, 
apart 
from 
the 
highest 
officials, 
though 
he 
might 
very 
well, 
in 
his 
capacity 
as 
a 
voter, 
have 
participated 
in 
some 
fashion 
in 
framing 
the 
directives 
issued 
by 
the 
central 
authority, 
would 
be 
in 
the 
subservient 
position 
of 
an 
administrator 
bound 
to 
carry 
them 
out 
obediently. 


A 
socialist 
state 
of 
this 
kind 
is 
not 
comparable 
to 
the 
state 
enterprises, 
no 
matter 
how 
vast 
their 
scale, 
that 
we 
have 
seen 
developing 
in 
the 
last 
decades 



in 
Europe, 
especially 
in 
Germany 
and 
Russia. 
The 
latter 
all 
flourish 
side 
by 
side 
with 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
They 
engage 
in 
commercial 
transactions 
with 
enterprises 
that 
capitalists 
own 
and 
manage, 
and 
they 
receive 
various 
stimuli 
from 
these 
enterprises 
that 
invigorate 
their 
own 
operation. 
State 
railroads, 
for 
instance, 
are 
provided 
by 
their 
suppliers, 
the 
manufacturers 
of 
locomotives, 
coaches, 
signal 
installations, 
and 
other 
equipment, 
with 
apparatus 
that 
has 
proved 
successful 
elsewhere 
in 
the 
operation 
of 
privately 
owned 
railroads. 
Thence 
they 
receive 
the 
incentive 
to 
institute 
innovations 
in 
order 
to 
keep 
up 
with 
the 
progress 
in 
technology 
and 
in 
methods 
of 
business 
management 
that 
is 
taking 
place 
all 
around 
them. 


It 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
common 
knowledge 
that 
national 
and 
municipal 
enterprises 
have, 
on 
the 
whole, 
failed, 
that 
they 
are 
expensive 
and 
inefficient, 
and 
that 
they 
have 
to 
be 
subsidized 
out 
of 
tax 
funds 
just 
to 
maintain 
themselves 
in 
operation. 
Of 
course, 
where 
a 
public 
enterprise 
occupies 
a 
monopolistic 
position—as 
is, 
for 
instance, 
generally 
the 
case 
with 
municipal 
transportation 
facilities 
and 
electric 
light 
and 
power 
plants—the 
bad 
consequences 
of 
inefficiency 
need 
not 
always 
express 
themselves 
in 
visible 
financial 
failure. 
Under 
certain 
circumstances 
it 
may 
be 
possible 
to 
conceal 
it 
by 
making 
use 
of 
the 
opportunity 
open 
to 
the 
monopolist 
of 
raising 
the 
price 
of 
his 
products 
and 
services 
high 
enough 
to 
render 
these 
enterprises, 
in 
spite 
of 
their 
uneconomic 
management, 
still 
profitable. 
The 
lower 
productivity 
of 
the 
socialist 
method 
of 
production 
merely 
manifests 
itself 
differently 
here 
and 
is 
not 
so 
easily 
recognized 
as 
otherwise; 
essentially, 
however, 
the 
case 
remains 
the 
same. 


But 
none 
of 
these 
experiments 
in 
the 
socialist 
management 
of 
enterprises 
can 
afford 
us 
any 
basis 
for 
judging 
what 
it 
would 
mean 
if 
the 
socialist 
ideal 
of 
the 
communal 
ownership 
of 
all 
means 
of 
production 
were 
to 
be 
realized. 
In 
the 
socialist 
society 
of 
the 
future, 
which 
will 
leave 
no 
room 
whatsoever 
for 
the 
free 
activity 
of 
private 
enterprises 
operating 
side 
by 
side 
with 
those 
owned 
and 
controlled 
by 
the 
state, 
the 
central 
planning 
board 
will 
lack 
entirely 
the 
gauge 
provided 
for 
the 
whole 
economy 
by 
the 
market 
and 
market 
prices. 
In 
the 
market, 
where 
all 
goods 
and 
services 
come 
to 
be 
traded, 
exchange 
ratios, 
expressed 
in 
money 
prices, 
may 
be 
determined 
for 
everything 
bought 
and 
sold. 
In 
a 
social 
order 
based 
on 
private 
property, 
it 
thus 
becomes 
possible 
to 
resort 
to 
monetary 
calculation 
in 
checking 
on 
the 
results 
of 
all 
economic 
activities. 
The 
social 
productivity 
of 
every 
economic 



transaction 
may 
be 
tested 
by 
the 
methods 
of 
bookkeeping 
and 
cost 
accounting. 
It 
yet 
remains 
to 
be 
shown 
that 
public 
enterprises 
are 
unable 
to 
make 
use 
of 
cost 
accounting 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
private 
enterprises 
do. 
Nevertheless, 
monetary 
calculation 
does 
give 
even 
governmental 
and 
communal 
enterprises 
some 
basis 
for 
judging 
the 
success 
or 
failure 
of 
their 
management. 
In 
a 
completely 
socialist 
economic 
system, 
this 
would 
be 
quite 
impossible, 
for 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
there 
could 
be 
no 
exchange 
of 
capital 
goods 
in 
the 
market 
and 
consequently 
neither 
money 
prices 
nor 
monetary 
calculation. 
The 
general 
management 
of 
a 
purely 
socialist 
society 
will 
therefore 
have 
no 
means 
of 
reducing 
to 
a 
common 
denominator 
the 
costs 
of 
production 
of 
all 
the 
heterogeneous 
commodities 
that 
it 
plans 
to 
produce. 


Nor 
can 
this 
be 
achieved 
by 
setting 
expenditures 
in 
kind 
against 
savings 
in 
kind. 
One 
cannot 
calculate 
if 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
reduce 
to 
a 
common 
medium 
of 
expression 
hours 
of 
labor 
of 
various 
grades, 
iron, 
coal, 
building 
materials 
of 
every 
kind, 
machines, 
and 
all 
the 
other 
things 
needed 
in 
the 
operation 
and 
management 
of 
different 
enterprises. 
Calculation 
is 
possible 
only 
when 
one 
is 
able 
to 
reduce 
to 
monetary 
terms 
all 
the 
goods 
under 
consideration. 
Of 
course, 
monetary 
calculation 
has 
its 
imperfections 
and 
deficiencies, 
but 
we 
have 
nothing 
better 
to 
put 
in 
its 
place. 
It 
suffices 
for 
the 
practical 
purposes 
of 
life 
as 
long 
as 
the 
monetary 
system 
is 
sound. 
If 
we 
were 
to 
renounce 
monetary 
calculation, 
every 
economic 
computation 
would 
become 
absolutely 
impossible. 


This 
is 
the 
decisive 
objection 
that 
economics 
raises 
against 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
socialist 
society. 
It 
must 
forgo 
the 
intellectual 
division 
of 
labor 
that 
consists 
in 
the 
cooperation 
of 
all 
entrepreneurs, 
landowners, 
and 
workers 
as 
producers 
and 
consumers 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
market 
prices. 
But 
without 
it, 
rationality, 
i.e., 
the 
possibility 
of 
economic 
calculation, 
is 
unthinkable. 


5. 
Interventionism 
The 
socialist 
ideal 
is 
now 
beginning 
to 
lose 
more 
and 
more 
of 
its 
adherents. 
The 
penetrating 
economic 
and 
sociological 
investigations 
of 
the 
problems 
of 
socialism 
that 
have 
shown 
it 
to 
be 
impracticable 
have 
not 
remained 
without 
effect, 
and 
the 
failures 
in 
which 
socialist 
experiments 



everywhere 
have 
ended 
have 
disconcerted 
even 
its 
most 
enthusiastic 
supporters. 
Gradually 
people 
are 
once 
more 
beginning 
to 
realize 
that 
society 
cannot 
do 
without 
private 
property. 
Yet 
the 
hostile 
criticism 
to 
which 
the 
system 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
has 
been 
subjected 
for 
decades 
has 
left 
behind 
such 
a 
strong 
prejudice 
against 
the 
capitalist 
system 
that, 
in 
spite 
of 
their 
knowledge 
of 
the 
inadequacy 
and 
impracticability 
of 
socialism, 
people 
cannot 
make 
up 
their 
minds 
to 
admit 
openly 
that 
they 
must 
return 
to 
liberal 
views 
on 
the 
question 
of 
property. 
To 
be 
sure, 
it 
is 
conceded 
that 
socialism, 
the 
communal 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
is 
altogether, 
or 
at 
least 
for 
the 
present, 
impracticable. 
But, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
is 
asserted 
that 
unhampered 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
is 
also 
an 
evil. 
Thus 
people 
want 
to 
create 
a 
third 
way, 
a 
form 
of 
society 
standing 
midway 
between 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
communal 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
on 
the 
other. 
Private 
property 
will 
be 
permitted 
to 
exist, 
but 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
the 
means 
of 
production 
are 
employed 
by 
the 
entrepreneurs, 
capitalists, 
and 
landowners 
will 
be 
regulated, 
guided, 
and 
controlled 
by 
authoritarian 
decrees 
and 
prohibitions. 
In 
this 
way, 
one 
forms 
the 
conceptual 
image 
of 
a 
regulated 
market, 
of 
a 
capitalism 
circumscribed 
by 
authoritarian 
rules, 
of 
private 
property 
shorn 
of 
its 
allegedly 
harmful 
concomitant 
features 
by 
the 
intervention 
of 
the 
authorities. 


One 
can 
best 
acquire 
an 
insight 
into 
the 
meaning 
and 
nature 
of 
this 
system 
by 
considering 
a 
few 
examples 
of 
the 
consequences 
of 
government 
interference. 
The 
crucial 
acts 
of 
intervention 
with 
which 
we 
have 
to 
deal 
aim 
at 
fixing 
the 
prices 
of 
goods 
and 
services 
at 
a 
height 
different 
from 
what 
the 
unhampered 
market 
would 
have 
determined. 


In 
the 
case 
of 
prices 
formed 
on 
the 
unhampered 
market, 
or 
which 
would 
have 
been 
formed 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
interference 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
authorities, 
the 
costs 
of 
production 
are 
covered 
by 
the 
proceeds. 
If 
a 
lower 
price 
is 
decreed 
by 
the 
government, 
the 
proceeds 
will 
fall 
short 
of 
the 
costs. 
Merchants 
and 
manufacturers 
will, 
therefore, 
unless 
the 
storage 
of 
the 
goods 
involved 
would 
cause 
them 
to 
deteriorate 
rapidly 
in 
value, 
withhold 
their 
merchandise 
from 
the 
market 
in 
the 
hope 
of 
more 
favorable 
times, 
perhaps 
in 
the 
expectation 
that 
the 
government 
order 
will 
soon 
be 
rescinded. 
If 
the 
authorities 
do 
not 
want 
the 
goods 
concerned 
to 
disappear 
altogether 
from 
the 
market 
as 
a 
result 
of 
their 
interference, 
they 
cannot 
limit 
themselves 
to 
fixing 



the 
price; 
they 
must 
at 
the 
same 
time 
also 
decree 
that 
all 
stocks 
on 
hand 
be 
sold 
at 
the 
prescribed 
price. 


But 
even 
this 
does 
not 
suffice. 
At 
the 
price 
determined 
on 
the 
unhampered 
market, 
supply 
and 
demand 
would 
have 
coincided. 
Now, 
because 
the 
price 
was 
fixed 
lower 
by 
government 
decree, 
the 
demand 
has 
increased 
while 
the 
supply 
has 
remained 
unchanged. 
The 
stocks 
on 
hand 
are 
not 
sufficient 
to 
satisfy 
fully 
all 
who 
are 
prepared 
to 
pay 
the 
prescribed 
price. 
A 
part 
of 
the 
demand 
will 
remain 
unsatisfied. 
The 
mechanism 
of 
the 
market, 
which 
otherwise 
tends 
to 
equalize 
supply 
and 
demand 
by 
means 
of 
price 
fluctuations, 
no 
longer 
operates. 
Now 
people 
who 
would 
have 
been 
prepared 
to 
pay 
the 
price 
prescribed 
by 
the 
authorities 
must 
leave 
the 
market 
with 
empty 
hands. 
Those 
who 
were 
on 
line 
earlier 
or 
who 
were 
in 
a 
position 
to 
exploit 
some 
personal 
connection 
with 
the 
sellers 
have 
already 
acquired 
the 
whole 
stock; 
the 
others 
have 
to 
go 
unprovided. 
If 
the 
government 
wishes 
to 
avoid 
this 
consequence 
of 
its 
intervention, 
which 
runs 
counter 
to 
its 
intentions, 
it 
must 
add 
rationing 
to 
price 
control 
and 
compulsory 
sale: 
a 
governmental 
regulation 
must 
determine 
how 
much 
of 
a 
commodity 
may 
be 
supplied 
to 
each 
individual 
applicant 
at 
the 
prescribed 
price. 


But 
once 
the 
supplies 
already 
on 
hand 
at 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
government’s 
intervention 
are 
exhausted, 
an 
incomparably 
more 
difficult 
problem 
arises. 
Since 
production 
is 
no 
longer 
profitable 
if 
the 
goods 
are 
to 
be 
sold 
at 
the 
price 
fixed 
by 
the 
government, 
it 
will 
be 
reduced 
or 
entirely 
suspended. 
If 
the 
government 
wishes 
to 
have 
production 
continue, 
it 
must 
compel 
the 
manufacturers 
to 
produce, 
and, 
to 
this 
end, 
it 
must 
also 
fix 
the 
prices 
of 
raw 
materials 
and 
half-finished 
goods 
and 
the 
wages 
of 
labor. 
Its 
decrees 
to 
this 
effect, 
however, 
cannot 
be 
limited 
to 
only 
the 
one 
or 
the 
few 
branches 
of 
production 
that 
the 
authorities 
wish 
to 
regulate 
because 
they 
deem 
their 
products 
especially 
important. 
They 
must 
encompass 
all 
branches 
of 
production. 
They 
must 
regulate 
the 
price 
of 
all 
commodities 
and 
all 
wages. 
In 
short, 
they 
must 
extend 
their 
control 
over 
the 
conduct 
of 
all 
entrepreneurs, 
capitalists, 
landowners, 
and 
workers. 
If 
some 
branches 
of 
production 
are 
left 
free, 
capital 
and 
labor 
will 
flow 
into 
these, 
and 
the 
government 
will 
fail 
to 
attain 
the 
goal 
that 
it 
wished 
to 
achieve 
by 
its 
first 
act 
of 
intervention. 
But 
the 
object 
of 
the 
authorities 
is 
that 
there 
should 
be 
an 
abundance 
of 
production 
in 
precisely 
that 
branch 
of 
industry 
which, 
because 
of 
the 
importance 
they 
attach 
to 
its 
products, 
they 
have 
especially 
singled 
out 
for 
regulation. 
It 
runs 



altogether 
counter 
to 
their 
design 
that 
precisely 
in 
consequence 
of 
their 
intervention 
this 
branch 
of 
production 
should 
be 
neglected. 


It 
is 
therefore 
clearly 
evident 
that 
an 
attempt 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
government 
to 
interfere 
with 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
economic 
system 
based 
on 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
fails 
of 
the 
goal 
that 
its 
authors 
wished 
to 
achieve 
by 
means 
of 
it. 
It 
is, 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
its 
authors, 
not 
only 
futile, 
but 
downright 
contrary 
to 
purpose, 
because 
it 
enormously 
augments 
the 
very 
“evil” 
that 
it 
was 
supposed 
to 
combat. 
Before 
the 
price 
controls 
were 
decreed, 
the 
commodity 
was, 
in 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
government, 
too 
expensive; 
now 
it 
disappears 
from 
the 
market 
altogether. 
This, 
however, 
is 
not 
the 
result 
aimed 
at 
by 
the 
government, 
which 
wanted 
to 
make 
the 
commodity 
accessible 
to 
the 
consumer 
at 
a 
cheaper 
price. 
On 
the 
contrary: 
from 
its 
viewpoint, 
the 
absence 
of 
the 
commodity, 
the 
impossibility 
of 
securing 
it, 
must 
appear 
as 
by 
far 
the 
greater 
evil. 
In 
this 
sense 
one 
can 
say 
of 
the 
intervention 
of 
the 
authorities 
that 
it 
is 
futile 
and 
contrary 
to 
the 
purpose 
that 
it 
was 
intended 
to 
serve, 
and 
of 
the 
system 
of 
economic 
policy 
that 
attempts 
to 
operate 
by 
means 
of 
such 
acts 
of 
intervention 
that 
it 
is 
impracticable 
and 
unthinkable, 
that 
it 
contradicts 
economic 
logic. 


If 
the 
government 
will 
not 
set 
things 
right 
again 
by 
desisting 
from 
its 
interference, 
i.e., 
by 
rescinding 
the 
price 
controls, 
then 
it 
must 
follow 
up 
the 
first 
step 
with 
others. 
To 
the 
prohibition 
against 
asking 
any 
price 
higher 
than 
the 
prescribed 
one 
it 
must 
add 
not 
only 
measures 
to 
compel 
the 
sale 
of 
all 
stocks 
on 
hand 
under 
a 
system 
of 
enforced 
rationing, 
but 
price 
ceilings 
on 
goods 
of 
higher 
order, 
wage 
controls, 
and, 
ultimately, 
compulsory 
labor 
for 
entrepreneurs 
and 
workers. 
And 
these 
regulations 
cannot 
be 
limited 
to 
one 
or 
a 
few 
branches 
of 
production, 
but 
must 
encompass 
them 
all. 
There 
is 
simply 
no 
other 
choice 
than 
this: 
either 
to 
abstain 
from 
interference 
in 
the 
free 
play 
of 
the 
market, 
or 
to 
delegate 
the 
entire 
management 
of 
production 
and 
distribution 
to 
the 
government. 
Either 
capitalism 
or 
socialism: 
there 
exists 
no 
middle 
way. 


The 
mechanism 
of 
the 
series 
of 
events 
just 
described 
is 
well 
known 
to 
all 
who 
have 
witnessed 
the 
attempts 
of 
governments 
in 
time 
of 
war 
and 
during 
periods 
of 
inflation 
to 
fix 
prices 
by 
fiat. 
Everyone 
knows 
nowadays 
that 
government 
price 
controls 
had 
no 
other 
result 
than 
the 
disappearance 
from 
the 
market 
of 
the 
goods 
concerned. 
Wherever 
the 
government 
resorts 
to 
the 
fixing 
of 
prices, 
the 
result 
is 
always 
the 
same. 
When, 
for 
instance, 
the 



government 
fixes 
a 
ceiling 
on 
residential 
rents, 
a 
housing 
shortage 
immediately 
ensues. 
In 
Austria, 
the 
Social 
Democratic 
Party 
has 
virtually 
abolished 
residential 
rent. 
The 
consequence 
is 
that 
in 
the 
city 
of 
Vienna, 
for 
example, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
population 
has 
declined 
considerably 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
World 
War 
and 
that 
several 
thousand 
new 
houses 
have 
been 
constructed 
by 
the 
municipality 
in 
the 
meantime, 
many 
thousands 
of 
persons 
are 
unable 
to 
find 
accommodations. 


Let 
us 
take 
still 
another 
example: 
the 
fixing 
of 
minimum 
wage 
rates. 


When 
the 
relationship 
between 
employer 
and 
employee 
is 
left 
undisturbed 
by 
legislative 
enactments 
or 
by 
violent 
measures 
on 
the 
part 
of 
trade 
unions, 
the 
wages 
paid 
by 
the 
employer 
for 
every 
type 
of 
labor 
are 
exactly 
as 
high 
as 
the 
increment 
of 
value 
that 
it 
adds 
to 
the 
materials 
in 
production. 
Wages 
cannot 
rise 
any 
higher 
than 
this 
because, 
if 
they 
did, 
the 
employer 
could 
no 
longer 
make 
a 
profit 
and 
hence 
would 
be 
compelled 
to 
discontinue 
a 
line 
of 
production 
that 
did 
not 
pay. 
But 
neither 
can 
wages 
fall 
any 
lower, 
because 
then 
the 
workers 
would 
turn 
to 
other 
branches 
of 
industry 
where 
they 
would 
be 
better 
rewarded, 
so 
that 
the 
employer 
would 
be 
forced 
to 
discontinue 
production 
because 
of 
a 
labor 
shortage. 


There 
is, 
therefore, 
in 
the 
economy 
always 
a 
wage 
rate 
at 
which 
all 
workers 
find 
employment 
and 
every 
entrepreneur 
who 
wishes 
to 
undertake 
some 
enterprise 
still 
profitable 
at 
that 
wage 
finds 
workers. 
This 
wage 
rate 
is 
customarily 
called 
by 
economists 
the 
“static” 
or 
“natural” 
wage. 
It 
increases 
if, 
other 
things 
being 
equal, 
the 
number 
of 
workers 
diminishes; 
it 
decreases 
if, 
other 
things 
being 
equal, 
the 
available 
quantity 
of 
capital 
for 
which 
employment 
in 
production 
is 
sought 
suffers 
any 
diminution. 
However, 
one 
must, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
observe 
that 
it 
is 
not 
quite 
precise 
to 
speak 
simply 
of 
“wages” 
and 
“labor.” 
Labor 
services 
vary 
greatly 
in 
quality 
and 
quantity 
(calculated 
per 
unit 
of 
time), 
and 
so 
too 
do 
the 
wages 
of 
labor. 


If 
the 
economy 
never 
varied 
from 
the 
stationary 
state, 
then 
in 
a 
labor 
market 
unhampered 
by 
interference 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
government 
or 
by 
coercion 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
labor 
unions 
there 
would 
be 
no 
unemployed. 
But 
the 
stationary 
state 
of 
society 
is 
merely 
an 
imaginary 
construction 
of 
economic 
theory, 
an 
intellectual 
expedient 
indispensable 
for 
our 
thinking, 
that 
enables 
us, 
by 
contrast, 
to 
form 
a 
clear 
conception 
of 
the 
processes 
actually 
taking 
place 
in 
the 
economy 
which 
surrounds 
us 
and 
in 
which 
we 
live. 
Life—fortunately, 
we 
hasten 
to 
add—is 
never 
at 
rest. 
There 
is 
never 
a 



standstill 
in 
the 
economy, 
but 
perpetual 
changes, 
movement, 
innovation, 
the 
continual 
emergence 
of 
the 
unprecedented. 
There 
are, 
accordingly, 
always 
branches 
of 
production 
that 
are 
being 
shut 
down 
or 
curtailed 
because 
the 
demand 
for 
their 
products 
has 
fallen 
off, 
and 
other 
branches 
of 
production 
that 
are 
being 
expanded 
or 
even 
embarked 
upon 
for 
the 
first 
time. 
If 
we 
think 
only 
of 
the 
last 
few 
decades, 
we 
can 
at 
once 
enumerate 
a 
great 
number 
of 
new 
industries 
that 
have 
sprung 
up: 
e.g., 
the 
automobile 
industry, 
the 
airplane 
industry, 
the 
motion 
picture 
industry, 
the 
rayon 
industry, 
the 
canned 
goods 
industry, 
and 
the 
radio 
broadcasting 
industry. 
These 
branches 
of 
industry 
today 
employ 
millions 
of 
workers, 
only 
some 
of 
whom 
have 
been 
drawn 
from 
the 
increase 
in 
population. 
Some 
came 
from 
branches 
of 
production 
that 
were 
shut 
down, 
and 
even 
more 
from 
those 
that, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
technological 
improvements, 
are 
now 
able 
to 
manage 
with 
fewer 
workers. 


Occasionally 
the 
changes 
that 
occur 
in 
the 
relations 
among 
individual 
branches 
of 
production 
take 
place 
so 
slowly 
that 
no 
worker 
is 
obliged 
to 
shift 
to 
a 
new 
type 
of 
job; 
only 
young 
people, 
just 
beginning 
to 
earn 
their 
livelihood, 
will 
enter, 
in 
greater 
proportion, 
the 
new 
or 
expanding 
industries, 
Generally, 
however, 
in 
the 
capitalist 
system, 
with 
its 
rapid 
strides 
in 
improving 
human 
welfare, 
progress 
takes 
place 
too 
swiftly 
to 
spare 
individuals 
the 
necessity 
of 
adapting 
themselves 
to 
it. 
When, 
two 
hundred 
years 
or 
more 
ago, 
a 
young 
lad 
learned 
a 
craft, 
he 
could 
count 
on 
practicing 
it 
his 
whole 
life 
long 
in 
the 
way 
he 
had 
learned 
it, 
without 
any 
fear 
of 
being 
injured 
by 
his 
conservatism. 
Things 
are 
different 
today. 
The 
worker 
too 
must 
adjust 
himself 
to 
changing 
conditions, 
must 
add 
to 
what 
he 
has 
learned, 
or 
begin 
learning 
anew. 
He 
must 
leave 
occupations 
which 
no 
longer 
require 
the 
same 
number 
of 
workers 
as 
previously 
and 
enter 
one 
which 
has 
just 
come 
into 
being 
or 
which 
now 
needs 
more 
workers 
than 
before. 
But 
even 
if 
he 
remains 
in 
his 
old 
job, 
he 
must 
learn 
new 
techniques 
when 
circumstances 
demand 
it. 


All 
this 
affects 
the 
worker 
in 
the 
form 
of 
changes 
in 
wage 
rates. 
If 
a 
particular 
branch 
of 
business 
employs 
relatively 
too 
many 
workers, 
it 
discharges 
some, 
and 
those 
discharged 
will 
not 
easily 
find 
new 
work 
in 
the 
same 
branch 
of 
business. 
The 
pressure 
on 
the 
labor 
market 
exercised 
by 
the 
discharged 
workers 
depresses 
wages 
in 
this 
branch 
of 
production. 
This, 
in 
turn, 
induces 
the 
worker 
to 
look 
for 
employment 
in 
those 
branches 
of 
production 
that 
wish 
to 
attract 
new 
workers 
and 
are 
therefore 
prepared 
to 
pay 



higher 
wages. 


From 
this 
it 
becomes 
quite 
clear 
what 
must 
be 
done 
in 
order 
to 
satisfy 
the 
workers’ 
desire 
for 
employment 
and 
for 
high 
wages. 
Wages 
in 
general 
cannot 
be 
pushed 
above 
the 
height 
that 
they 
would 
normally 
occupy 
in 
a 
market 
unhampered 
either 
by 
government 
interference 
or 
other 
institutional 
pressures 
without 
creating 
certain 
side 
effects 
that 
cannot 
be 
desirable 
for 
the 
worker. 
Wages 
can 
be 
driven 
up 
in 
an 
individual 
industry 
or 
an 
individual 
country 
if 
the 
transfer 
of 
workers 
from 
other 
industries 
or 
their 
immigration 
from 
other 
countries 
is 
prohibited. 
Such 
wage 
increases 
are 
effected 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
workers 
whose 
entrance 
is 
barred. 
Their 
wages 
are 
now 
lower 
than 
they 
would 
have 
been 
if 
their 
freedom 
of 
movement 
had 
not 
been 
hindered. 
The 
rise 
in 
wages 
of 
one 
group 
is 
thus 
achieved 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
others. 
This 
policy 
of 
obstructing 
the 
free 
movement 
of 
labor 
can 
benefit 
only 
the 
workers 
in 
countries 
and 
industries 
suffering 
from 
a 
relative 
labor 
shortage. 
In 
an 
industry 
or 
a 
country 
where 
this 
is 
not 
the 
case, 
there 
is 
only 
one 
thing 
that 
can 
raise 
wages: 
a 
rise 
in 
the 
general 
productivity 
of 
labor, 
whether 
by 
virtue 
of 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
capital 
available 
or 
through 
an 
improvement 
in 
the 
technological 
processes 
of 
production. 


If, 
however, 
the 
government 
fixes 
minimum 
wages 
by 
law 
above 
the 
height 
of 
the 
static 
or 
natural 
wage, 
then 
the 
employers 
will 
find 
that 
they 
are 
no 
longer 
in 
a 
position 
to 
carry 
on 
successfully 
a 
number 
of 
enterprises 
that 
were 
still 
profitable 
when 
wages 
stood 
at 
the 
lower 
point. 
They 
will 
consequently 
curtail 
production 
and 
discharge 
workers. 
The 
effect 
of 
an 
artificial 
rise 
in 
wages, 
i.e., 
one 
imposed 
upon 
the 
market 
from 
the 
outside, 
is, 
therefore, 
the 
spread 
of 
unemployment. 


Now, 
of 
course, 
no 
attempt 
is 
being 
made 
today 
to 
fix 
minimum 
wage 
rates 
by 
law 
on 
a 
large 
scale. 
But 
the 
position 
of 
power 
that 
the 
trade 
unions 
occupy 
has 
enabled 
them 
to 
do 
so 
even 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
any 
positive 
legislation 
to 
that 
effect. 
The 
fact 
that 
workers 
form 
unions 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
bargaining 
with 
the 
employers 
does 
not, 
in 
and 
of 
itself, 
necessarily 
provoke 
disturbances 
in 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
market. 
Even 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
successfully 
arrogate 
to 
themselves 
the 
right 
to 
break, 
without 
notice, 
contracts 
duly 
entered 
into 
by 
them 
and 
to 
lay 
down 
their 
tools 
would 
not 
itself 
result 
in 
any 
further 
disturbance 
in 
the 
labor 
market. 
What 
does 
create 
a 
new 
situation 
in 
the 
labor 
market 
is 
the 
element 
of 
coercion 
involved 
in 
strikes 
and 
compulsory 
union 
membership 
that 
prevails 
today 
in 
most 
of 
the 



industrial 
countries 
of 
Europe. 
Since 
the 
unionized 
workers 
deny 
access 
to 
employment 
to 
those 
who 
are 
not 
members 
of 
their 
union, 
and 
resort 
to 
open 
violence 
during 
strikes 
to 
prevent 
other 
workers 
from 
taking 
the 
place 
of 
those 
on 
strike, 
the 
wage 
demands 
that 
the 
unions 
present 
to 
the 
employers 
have 
precisely 
the 
same 
force 
as 
government 
decrees 
fixing 
minimum 
wage 
rates. 
For 
the 
employer 
must, 
if 
he 
does 
not 
wish 
to 
shut 
down 
his 
whole 
enterprise, 
yield 
to 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
union. 
He 
must 
pay 
wages 
such 
that 
the 
volume 
of 
production 
has 
to 
be 
restricted, 
because 
what 
costs 
more 
to 
produce 
cannot 
find 
as 
large 
a 
market 
as 
what 
costs 
less. 
Thus, 
the 
higher 
wages 
exacted 
by 
the 
trade 
unions 
become 
a 
cause 
of 
unemployment. 


The 
unemployment 
originating 
from 
this 
source 
differs 
entirely 
in 
extent 
and 
duration 
from 
that 
which 
arises 
from 
the 
changes 
constantly 
taking 
place 
in 
the 
kind 
and 
quality 
of 
the 
labor 
demanded 
in 
the 
market. 
If 
unemployment 
had 
its 
cause 
only 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
is 
constant 
progress 
in 
industrial 
development, 
it 
could 
neither 
assume 
great 
proportions 
nor 
take 
on 
the 
character 
of 
a 
lasting 
institution. 
The 
workers 
who 
can 
no 
longer 
be 
employed 
in 
one 
branch 
of 
production 
soon 
find 
accommodation 
in 
others 
which 
are 
expanding 
or 
just 
coming 
into 
being. 
When 
workers 
enjoy 
freedom 
of 
movement 
and 
the 
shift 
from 
one 
industry 
to 
another 
is 
not 
impeded 
by 
legal 
and 
other 
obstacles 
of 
a 
similar 
kind, 
adjustment 
to 
new 
conditions 
takes 
place 
without 
too 
much 
difficulty 
and 
rather 
quickly. 
For 
the 
rest, 
the 
setting 
up 
of 
labor 
exchanges 
would 
contribute 
much 
toward 
reducing 
still 
further 
the 
extent 
of 
this 
type 
of 
unemployment. 


But 
the 
unemployment 
produced 
by 
the 
interference 
of 
coercive 
agencies 
in 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
labor 
market 
is 
no 
transitory 
phenomenon 
continually 
appearing 
and 
disappearing. 
It 
is 
incurable 
as 
long 
as 
the 
cause 
that 
called 
it 
into 
existence 
continues 
to 
operate, 
i.e., 
as 
long 
as 
the 
law 
or 
the 
violence 
of 
the 
trade 
unions 
prevents 
wages 
from 
being 
reduced, 
by 
the 
pressure 
of 
the 
jobless 
seeking 
employment, 
to 
the 
level 
that 
they 
would 
have 
reached 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
interference 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
government 
or 
the 
unions, 
namely, 
the 
rate 
at 
which 
all 
those 
eager 
for 
work 
ultimately 
find 
it. 


For 
the 
unemployed 
to 
be 
granted 
support 
by 
the 
government 
or 
by 
the 
unions 
only 
serves 
to 
enlarge 
the 
evil. 
If 
what 
is 
involved 
is 
a 
case 
of 
unemployment 
springing 
from 
dynamic 
changes 
in 
the 
economy, 
then 
the 
unemployment 
benefits 
only 
result 
in 
postponing 
the 
adjustment 
of 
the 
workers 
to 
the 
new 
conditions. 
The 
jobless 
worker 
who 
is 
on 
relief 
does 
not 



consider 
it 
necessary 
to 
look 
about 
for 
a 
new 
occupation 
if 
he 
no 
longer 
finds 
a 
position 
in 
his 
old 
one; 
at 
least, 
he 
allows 
more 
time 
to 
elapse 
before 
he 
decides 
to 
shift 
to 
a 
new 
occupation 
or 
to 
a 
new 
locality 
or 
before 
he 
reduces 
the 
wage 
rate 
he 
demands 
to 
that 
at 
which 
he 
could 
find 
work. 
If 
unemployment 
benefits 
are 
not 
set 
too 
low, 
one 
can 
say 
that 
as 
long 
as 
they 
are 
offered, 
unemployment 
cannot 
disappear. 


If, 
however, 
the 
unemployment 
is 
produced 
by 
the 
artificial 
raising 
of 
the 
height 
of 
wage 
rates 
in 
consequence 
of 
the 
direct 
intervention 
of 
the 
government 
or 
of 
its 
toleration 
of 
coercive 
practices 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
trade 
unions, 
then 
the 
only 
question 
is 
who 
is 
to 
bear 
the 
costs 
involved, 
the 
employers 
or 
the 
workers. 
The 
state, 
the 
government, 
the 
community 
never 
do 
so; 
they 
load 
them 
either 
onto 
the 
employer 
or 
onto 
the 
worker 
or 
partially 
onto 
each. 
If 
the 
burden 
falls 
on 
the 
workers, 
then 
they 
are 
deprived 
entirely 
or 
partially 
of 
the 
fruits 
of 
the 
artificial 
wage 
increase 
they 
have 
received; 
they 
may 
even 
be 
made 
to 
bear 
more 
of 
these 
costs 
than 
the 
artificial 
wage 
increase 
yielded 
them. 
The 
employer 
can 
be 
saddled 
with 
the 
burden 
of 
unemployment 
benefits 
to 
some 
extent 
by 
having 
to 
pay 
a 
tax 
proportionate 
to 
the 
total 
amount 
of 
wages 
paid 
out 
by 
him. 
In 
this 
case, 
unemployment 
insurance, 
by 
raising 
the 
costs 
of 
labor, 
has 
the 
same 
effect 
as 
a 
further 
increase 
in 
wages 
above 
the 
static 
level: 
the 
profitability 
of 
the 
employment 
of 
labor 
is 
reduced, 
and 
the 
number 
of 
workers 
who 
still 
can 
be 
profitably 
engaged 
is 
concomitantly 
decreased. 
Thus, 
unemployment 
spreads 
even 
further, 
in 
an 
ever 
widening 
spiral. 
The 
employers 
can 
also 
be 
drawn 
on 
to 
pay 
the 
costs 
of 
the 
unemployment 
benefits 
by 
means 
of 
a 
tax 
on 
their 
profits 
or 
capital, 
without 
regard 
for 
the 
number 
of 
workers 
employed. 
But 
this 
too 
only 
tends 
to 
spread 
unemployment 
even 
further. 
For 
when 
capital 
is 
consumed 
or 
when 
the 
formation 
of 
new 
capital 
is 
at 
least 
slowed 
down, 
the 
conditions 
for 
the 
employment 
of 
labor 
become, 
ceteris 
paribus, 
less 
favorable.[2] 


It 
is 
obviously 
futile 
to 
attempt 
to 
eliminate 
unemployment 
by 
embarking 
upon 
a 
program 
of 
public 
works 
that 
would 
otherwise 
not 
have 
been 
undertaken. 
The 
necessary 
resources 
for 
such 
projects 
must 
be 
withdrawn 
by 
taxes 
or 
loans 
from 
the 
application 
they 
would 
otherwise 
have 
found. 
Unemployment 
in 
one 
industry 
can, 
in 
this 
way, 
be 
mitigated 
only 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
it 
is 
increased 
in 
another. 


From 
whichever 
side 
we 
consider 
interventionism, 
it 
becomes 
evident 



that 
this 
system 
leads 
to 
a 
result 
that 
its 
originators 
and 
advocates 
did 
not 
intend 
and 
that, 
even 
from 
their 
standpoint, 
it 
must 
appear 
as 
a 
senseless, 
self-
defeating, 
absurd 
policy. 


6. 
Capitalism: 
The 
Only 
Possible 
System 
of 
Social 
Organization 
Every 
examination 
of 
the 
different 
conceivable 
possibilities 
of 
organizing 
society 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
must 
always 
come 
to 
the 
same 
result: 
there 
is 
only 
the 
choice 
between 
communal 
ownership 
and 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
All 
intermediate 
forms 
of 
social 
organization 
are 
unavailing 
and, 
in 
practice, 
must 
prove 
self-defeating. 
If 
one 
further 
realizes 
that 
socialism 
too 
is 
unworkable, 
then 
one 
cannot 
avoid 
acknowledging 
that 
capitalism 
is 
the 
only 
feasible 
system 
of 
social 
organization 
based 
on 
the 
division 
of 
labor. 
This 
result 
of 
theoretical 
investigation 
will 
not 
come 
as 
a 
surprise 
to 
the 
historian 
or 
the 
philosopher 
of 
history. 
If 
capitalism 
has 
succeeded 
in 
maintaining 
itself 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
enmity 
it 
has 
always 
encountered 
from 
both 
governments 
and 
the 
masses, 
if 
it 
has 
not 
been 
obliged 
to 
make 
way 
for 
other 
forms 
of 
social 
cooperation 
that 
have 
enjoyed 
to 
a 
much 
greater 
extent 
the 
sympathies 
of 
theoreticians 
and 
of 
practical 
men 
of 
affairs, 
this 
is 
to 
be 
attributed 
only 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
no 
other 
system 
of 
social 
organization 
is 
feasible. 


Nor 
is 
there 
any 
further 
need 
to 
explain 
why 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
us 
to 
return 
to 
the 
forms 
of 
social 
and 
economic 
organization 
characteristic 
of 
the 
Middle 
Ages. 
Over 
the 
whole 
area 
now 
inhabited 
by 
the 
modern 
nations 
of 
Europe 
the 
medieval 
economic 
system 
was 
able 
to 
support 
only 
a 
fraction 
of 
the 
number 
of 
people 
who 
now 
dwell 
in 
that 
region, 
and 
it 
placed 
much 
less 
in 
the 
way 
of 
material 
goods 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
each 
individual 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
his 
needs 
than 
the 
capitalist 
form 
of 
production 
supplies 
men 
with 
today. 
A 
return 
to 
the 
Middle 
Ages 
is 
out 
of 
the 
question 
if 
one 
is 
not 
prepared 
to 
reduce 
the 
population 
to 
a 
tenth 
or 
a 
twentieth 
part 
of 
its 
present 
number 
and, 
even 
further, 
to 
oblige 
every 
individual 
to 
be 
satisfied 
with 
a 
modicum 
so 
small 
as 
to 
be 
beyond 
the 
imagination 
of 
modern 
man. 


All 
the 
writers 
who 
represent 
the 
return 
to 
the 
Middle 
Ages, 
or, 
as 
they 
put 
it, 
to 
the 
“new” 
Middle 
Ages, 
as 
the 
only 
social 
ideal 
worth 
striving 
for 
reproach 
the 
capitalist 
era 
above 
all 
for 
its 
materialistic 
attitude 
and 
mentality. 
Yet 
they 
themselves 
are 
much 
more 
deeply 
committed 
to 
materialistic 
views 



than 
they 
believe. 
For 
it 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
crassest 
materialism 
to 
think, 
as 
many 
of 
these 
writers 
do, 
that 
after 
reverting 
to 
the 
forms 
of 
political 
and 
economic 
organization 
characteristic 
of 
the 
Middle 
Ages, 
society 
could 
still 
retain 
all 
the 
technological 
improvements 
in 
production 
created 
by 
capitalism 
and 
thus 
preserve 
the 
high 
degree 
of 
productivity 
of 
human 
labor 
that 
it 
has 
attained 
in 
the 
capitalist 
era. 
The 
productivity 
of 
the 
capitalist 
mode 
of 
production 
is 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
capitalist 
mentality 
and 
of 
the 
capitalist 
approach 
to 
man 
and 
to 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
man’s 
wants; 
it 
is 
a 
result 
of 
modern 
technology 
only 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
development 
of 
technology 
must, 
of 
necessity, 
follow 
from 
the 
capitalist 
mentality. 
There 
is 
scarcely 
anything 
so 
absurd 
as 
the 
fundamental 
principle 
of 
Marx’s 
materialist 
interpretation 
of 
history: 
“The 
hand 
mill 
made 
feudal 
society; 
the 
steam 
mill, 
capitalist 
society.” 
It 
was 
precisely 
capitalist 
society 
that 
was 
needed 
to 
create 
the 
necessary 
conditions 
for 
the 
original 
conception 
of 
the 
steam 
mill 
to 
be 
developed 
and 
put 
into 
effect. 
It 
was 
capitalism 
that 
created 
the 
technology, 
and 
not 
the 
other 
way 
round. 
But 
no 
less 
absurd 
is 
the 
notion 
that 
the 
technological 
and 
material 
appurtenances 
of 
our 
economy 
could 
be 
preserved 
even 
if 
the 
intellectual 
foundations 
on 
which 
they 
are 
based 
were 
destroyed. 
Economic 
activity 
can 
no 
longer 
be 
carried 
on 
rationally 
once 
the 
prevailing 
mentality 
has 
reverted 
to 
traditionalism 
and 
faith 
in 
authority. 
The 
entrepreneur, 
the 
catalytic 
agent, 
as 
it 
were, 
of 
the 
capitalist 
economy 
and, 
concomitantly, 
also 
of 
modern 
technology, 
is 
inconceivable 
in 
an 
environment 
in 
which 
everyone 
is 
intent 
solely 
on 
the 
contemplative 
life. 


If 
one 
characterizes 
as 
unfeasible 
every 
system 
other 
than 
that 
based 
on 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
it 
follows 
necessarily 
that 
private 
property 
must 
be 
maintained 
as 
the 
basis 
of 
social 
cooperation 
and 
association 
and 
that 
every 
attempt 
to 
abolish 
it 
must 
be 
vigorously 
combated. 
It 
is 
for 
this 
reason 
that 
liberalism 
defends 
the 
institution 
of 
private 
property 
against 
every 
attempt 
to 
destroy 
it. 
When, 
therefore, 
people 
call 
the 
liberals 
apologists 
for 
private 
property, 
they 
are 
completely 
justified, 
for 
the 
Greek 
word 
from 
which 
“apologist” 
is 
derived 
means 
the 
same 
as 
“defender.” 
Of 
course, 
it 
would 
be 
better 
to 
avoid 
using 
the 
foreign 
word 
and 
to 
be 
content 
to 
express 
oneself 
in 
plain 
English. 
For 
to 
many 
people 
the 
expressions 
“apology” 
and 
“apologist” 
convey 
the 
connotation 
that 
what 
is 
being 
defended 
is 
unjust. 


Much 
more 
important, 
however, 
than 
the 
rejection 
of 
any 
pejorative 



suggestion 
that 
may 
be 
involved 
in 
the 
use 
of 
these 
expressions 
is 
the 
observation 
that 
the 
institution 
of 
private 
property 
requires 
no 
defense, 
justification, 
support, 
or 
explanation. 
The 
continued 
existence 
of 
society 
depends 
upon 
private 
property, 
and 
since 
men 
have 
need 
of 
society, 
they 
must 
hold 
fast 
to 
the 
institution 
of 
private 
property 
to 
avoid 
injuring 
their 
own 
interests 
as 
well 
as 
the 
interests 
of 
everyone 
else. 
For 
society 
can 
continue 
to 
exist 
only 
on 
the 
foundation 
of 
private 
property. 
Whoever 
champions 
the 
latter 
champions 
by 
the 
same 
token 
the 
preservation 
of 
the 
social 
bond 
that 
unites 
mankind, 
the 
preservation 
of 
culture 
and 
civilization. 
He 
is 
an 
apologist 
and 
defender 
of 
society, 
culture, 
and 
civilization, 
and 
because 
he 
desires 
them 
as 
ends, 
he 
must 
also 
desire 
and 
defend 
the 
one 
means 
that 
leads 
to 
them, 
namely, 
private 
property. 


To 
advocate 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
is 
by 
no 
means 
to 
maintain 
that 
the 
capitalist 
social 
system, 
based 
on 
private 
property, 
is 
perfect. 
There 
is 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
earthly 
perfection. 
Even 
in 
the 
capitalist 
system 
something 
or 
other, 
many 
things, 
or 
even 
everything, 
may 
not 
be 
exactly 
to 
the 
liking 
of 
this 
or 
that 
individual. 
But 
it 
is 
the 
only 
possible 
social 
system. 
One 
may 
undertake 
to 
modify 
one 
or 
another 
of 
its 
features 
as 
long 
as 
in 
doing 
so 
one 
does 
not 
affect 
the 
essence 
and 
foundation 
of 
the 
whole 
social 
order, 
viz., 
private 
property. 
But 
by 
and 
large 
we 
must 
reconcile 
ourselves 
to 
this 
system 
because 
there 
simply 
cannot 
be 
any 
other. 


In 
Nature 
too, 
much 
may 
exist 
that 
we 
do 
not 
like. 
But 
we 
cannot 
change 
the 
essential 
character 
of 
natural 
events. 
If, 
for 
example, 
someone 
thinks—and 
there 
are 
some 
who 
have 
maintained 
as 
much—that 
the 
way 
in 
which 
man 
ingests 
his 
food, 
digests 
it, 
and 
incorporates 
it 
into 
his 
body 
is 
disgusting, 
one 
cannot 
argue 
the 
point 
with 
him. 
One 
must 
say 
to 
him: 
There 
is 
only 
this 
way 
or 
starvation. 
There 
is 
no 
third 
way. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
property: 
either-or—either 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
or 
hunger 
and 
misery 
for 
everyone. 


The 
opponents 
of 
liberalism 
are 
wont 
to 
call 
its 
economic 
doctrine 
“optimistic.” 
They 
intend 
this 
epithet 
either 
as 
a 
reproach 
or 
as 
a 
derisive 
characterization 
of 
the 
liberal 
way 
of 
thinking. 


If 
by 
calling 
the 
liberal 
doctrine 
“optimistic” 
one 
means 
that 
liberalism 
considers 
the 
capitalist 
world 
as 
the 
best 
of 
all 
worlds, 
then 
this 
is 
nothing 
but 
pure 
nonsense. 
For 
an 
ideology 
based, 
like 
that 
of 
liberalism, 
entirely 
on 
scientific 
grounds, 
such 
questions 
as 
whether 
the 
capitalist 
system 
is 
good 
or 



bad, 
whether 
or 
not 
a 
better 
one 
is 
conceivable, 
and 
whether 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
rejected 
on 
certain 
philosophic 
or 
metaphysical 
grounds 
are 
entirely 
irrelevant. 
Liberalism 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
pure 
sciences 
of 
economics 
and 
sociology, 
which 
make 
no 
value 
judgments 
within 
their 
own 
spheres 
and 
say 
nothing 
about 
what 
ought 
to 
be 
or 
about 
what 
is 
good 
and 
what 
is 
bad, 
but, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
only 
ascertain 
what 
is 
and 
how 
it 
comes 
to 
be. 
When 
these 
sciences 
show 
us 
that 
of 
all 
the 
conceivable 
alternative 
ways 
of 
organizing 
society 
only 
one, 
viz., 
the 
system 
based 
on 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
is 
capable 
of 
being 
realized, 
because 
all 
other 
conceivable 
systems 
of 
social 
organization 
are 
unworkable, 
there 
is 
absolutely 
nothing 
in 
this 
that 
can 
justify 
the 
designation 
“optimistic.” 
That 
capitalism 
is 
practicable 
and 
workable 
is 
a 
conclusion 
that 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
optimism. 


To 
be 
sure, 
the 
opponents 
of 
liberalism 
are 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
this 
society 
is 
very 
bad. 
As 
far 
as 
this 
assertion 
contains 
a 
value 
judgment, 
it 
is 
naturally 
not 
open 
to 
any 
discussion 
that 
intends 
to 
go 
beyond 
highly 
subjective 
and 
therefore 
unscientific 
opinions. 
As 
far, 
however, 
as 
it 
is 
founded 
on 
an 
incorrect 
understanding 
of 
what 
takes 
place 
within 
the 
capitalist 
system, 
economics 
and 
sociology 
can 
rectify 
it. 
This 
too 
is 
not 
optimism. 
Entirely 
aside 
from 
everything 
else, 
even 
the 
discovery 
of 
a 
great 
many 
deficiencies 
in 
the 
capitalist 
system 
would 
not 
have 
the 
slightest 
significance 
for 
the 
problems 
of 
social 
policy 
as 
long 
as 
it 
has 
not 
been 
shown, 
not 
that 
a 
different 
social 
system 
would 
be 
better, 
but 
that 
it 
would 
be 
capable 
of 
being 
realized 
at 
all. 
But 
this 
has 
not 
been 
done. 
Science 
has 
succeeded 
in 
showing 
that 
every 
system 
of 
social 
organization 
that 
could 
be 
conceived 
as 
a 
substitute 
for 
the 
capitalist 
system 
is 
self-contradictory 
and 
unavailing, 
so 
that 
it 
could 
not 
bring 
about 
the 
results 
aimed 
at 
by 
its 
proponents. 


How 
little 
one 
is 
justified 
in 
speaking 
in 
this 
connection 
of 
“optimism” 
and 
“pessimism” 
and 
how 
much 
the 
characterization 
of 
liberalism 
as 
“optimistic” 
aims 
at 
surrounding 
it 
with 
an 
unfavorable 
aura 
by 
bringing 
in 
extrascientific, 
emotional 
considerations 
is 
best 
shown 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
one 
can, 
with 
as 
much 
justice, 
call 
those 
people 
“optimists” 
who 
are 
convinced 
that 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
socialist 
or 
of 
an 
interventionist 
commonwealth 
would 
be 
practicable. 


Most 
of 
the 
writers 
who 
concern 
themselves 
with 
economic 
questions 



never 
miss 
an 
opportunity 
to 
heap 
senseless 
and 
childish 
abuse 
on 
the 
capitalist 
system 
and 
to 
praise 
in 
enthusiastic 
terms 
either 
socialism 
or 
interventionism, 
or 
even 
agrarian 
socialism 
and 
syndicalism, 
as 
excellent 
institutions. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
there 
have 
been 
a 
few 
writers 
who, 
even 
if 
in 
much 
milder 
terms, 
have 
sung 
the 
praises 
of 
the 
capitalist 
system. 
One 
may, 
if 
one 
wishes, 
call 
these 
writers 
“optimists.” 
But 
if 
one 
does 
so, 
then 
one 
would 
be 
a 
thousand 
times 
more 
justified 
in 
calling 
the 
antiliberal 
writers 
“hyperoptimists” 
of 
socialism, 
interventionism, 
agrarian 
socialism, 
and 
syndicalism. 
The 
fact 
that 
this 
does 
not 
happen, 
but 
that, 
instead, 
only 
liberal 
writers 
like 
Bastiat 
are 
called 
“optimists,” 
shows 
clearly 
that 
in 
these 
cases 
what 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
is 
not 
an 
attempt 
at 
a 
truly 
scientific 
classification, 
but 
nothing 
more 
than 
a 
partisan 
caricature. 


What 
liberalism 
maintains 
is, 
we 
repeat, 
by 
no 
means 
that 
capitalism 
is 
good 
when 
considered 
from 
some 
particular 
point 
of 
view. 
What 
it 
says 
is 
simply 
that 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
ends 
that 
men 
have 
in 
mind 
only 
the 
capitalist 
system 
is 
suitable 
and 
that 
every 
attempt 
to 
realize 
a 
socialist, 
interventionist, 
agrarian 
socialist, 
or 
syndicalist 
society 
must 
necessarily 
prove 
unsuccessful. 
Neurotics 
who 
could 
not 
bear 
this 
truth 
have 
called 
economics 
a 
dismal 
science. 
But 
economics 
and 
sociology 
are 
no 
more 
dismal 
because 
they 
show 
us 
the 
world 
as 
it 
really 
is 
than 
the 
other 
sciences 
are—mechanics, 
for 
instance, 
because 
it 
teaches 
the 
impracticability 
of 
perpetual 
motion, 
or 
biology 
because 
it 
teaches 
us 
the 
mortality 
of 
all 
living 
things. 


7. 
Cartels, 
Monopolies, 
and 
Liberalism 
The 
opponents 
of 
liberalism 
assert 
that 
the 
necessary 
preconditions 
for 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
liberal 
program 
no 
longer 
exist 
in 
the 
contemporary 
world. 
Liberalism 
was 
still 
practicable 
when 
many 
concerns 
of 
medium 
size 
were 
engaged 
in 
keen 
competition 
in 
each 
industry. 
Nowadays, 
since 
trusts, 
cartels, 
and 
other 
monopolistic 
enterprises 
are 
in 
complete 
control 
of 
the 
market, 
liberalism 
is 
as 
good 
as 
done 
for 
in 
any 
case. 
It 
is 
not 
politics 
that 
has 
destroyed 
it, 
but 
a 
tendency 
inherent 
in 
the 
inexorable 
evolution 
of 
the 
system 
of 
free 
enterprise. 


The 
division 
of 
labor 
gives 
a 
specialized 
function 
to 
each 
productive 
unit 
in 
the 
economy. 
This 
process 
never 
stops 
as 
long 
as 
economic 
development 



continues. 
We 
long 
ago 
passed 
the 
stage 
at 
which 
the 
same 
factory 
produced 
all 
types 
of 
machines. 
Today 
a 
machine 
factory 
that 
does 
not 
limit 
itself 
exclusively 
to 
the 
production 
of 
certain 
types 
of 
machinery 
is 
no 
longer 
able 
to 
meet 
competition. 
With 
the 
progress 
of 
specialization, 
the 
area 
served 
by 
an 
individual 
supplier 
must 
continue 
to 
widen. 
The 
market 
supplied 
by 
a 
textile 
mill 
that 
produces 
only 
a 
few 
kinds 
of 
fabrics 
must 
be 
larger 
than 
that 
served 
by 
a 
weaver 
who 
weaves 
every 
kind 
of 
cloth. 
Undoubtedly 
this 
progressive 
specialization 
of 
production 
tends 
toward 
the 
development 
in 
every 
field 
of 
enterprises 
that 
have 
the 
whole 
world 
for 
their 
market. 
If 
this 
development 
is 
not 
opposed 
by 
protectionist 
and 
other 
anticapitalist 
measures, 
the 
result 
will 
be 
that 
in 
every 
branch 
of 
production 
there 
will 
be 
a 
relatively 
small 
number 
of 
concerns, 
or 
even 
only 
a 
single 
concern, 
intent 
on 
producing 
with 
the 
highest 
degree 
of 
specialization 
and 
on 
supplying 
the 
whole 
world. 


Today, 
of 
course, 
we 
are 
very 
far 
from 
this 
state 
of 
affairs, 
since 
the 
policy 
of 
all 
governments 
aims 
at 
snipping 
off 
from 
the 
unity 
of 
the 
world 
economy 
small 
areas 
in 
which, 
under 
the 
protection 
of 
tariffs 
and 
other 
measures 
designed 
to 
achieve 
the 
same 
result, 
enterprises 
that 
would 
no 
longer 
be 
able 
to 
meet 
competition 
on 
the 
free 
world 
market 
are 
artificially 
preserved 
or 
even 
first 
called 
into 
being. 
Apart 
from 
considerations 
of 
commercial 
policy, 
measures 
of 
this 
kind, 
which 
are 
directed 
against 
the 
concentration 
of 
business, 
are 
defended 
on 
the 
ground 
that 
they 
alone 
have 
prevented 
the 
consumers 
from 
being 
exploited 
by 
monopolistic 
combinations 
of 
producers. 


In 
order 
to 
assess 
the 
validity 
of 
this 
argument, 
we 
shall 
assume 
that 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
throughout 
the 
whole 
world 
has 
already 
advanced 
so 
far 
that 
the 
production 
of 
every 
article 
offered 
for 
sale 
is 
concentrated 
in 
a 
single 
concern, 
so 
that 
the 
consumer, 
in 
his 
capacity 
as 
a 
buyer, 
is 
always 
confronted 
with 
only 
a 
single 
seller. 
Under 
such 
conditions, 
according 
to 
an 
ill-considered 
economic 
doctrine, 
the 
producers 
would 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
keep 
prices 
pegged 
as 
high 
as 
they 
wished, 
to 
realize 
exorbitant 
profits, 
and 
thereby 
to 
worsen 
considerably 
the 
standard 
of 
living 
of 
the 
consumers. 
It 
is 
not 
difficult 
to 
see 
that 
this 
idea 
is 
completely 
mistaken. 
Monopoly 
prices, 
if 
they 
are 
not 
made 
possible 
by 
certain 
acts 
of 
intervention 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
government, 
can 
be 
lastingly 
exacted 
only 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
control 
over 
mineral 
and 
other 
natural 
resources. 
An 
isolated 
monopoly 
in 
manufacturing 



that 
yielded 
greater 
profits 
than 
those 
yielded 
elsewhere 
would 
stimulate 
the 
formation 
of 
rival 
firms 
whose 
competition 
would 
break 
the 
monopoly 
and 
restore 
prices 
and 
profits 
to 
the 
general 
rate. 
Monopolies 
in 
manufacturing 
industries 
cannot, 
however, 
become 
general, 
since 
at 
every 
given 
level 
of 
wealth 
in 
an 
economy 
the 
total 
quantity 
of 
capital 
invested 
and 
of 
available 
labor 
employed 
in 
production—and 
consequently 
also 
the 
amount 
of 
the 
social 
product—is 
a 
given 
magnitude. 
In 
any 
particular 
branch 
of 
production, 
or 
in 
several, 
the 
amount 
of 
capital 
and 
labor 
employed 
could 
be 
reduced 
in 
order 
to 
increase 
the 
price 
per 
unit 
and 
the 
aggregate 
profit 
of 
the 
monopolist 
or 
monopolists 
by 
curtailing 
production. 
The 
capital 
and 
labor 
thereby 
freed 
would 
then 
flow 
into 
another 
industry. 
If, 
however, 
all 
industries 
attempt 
to 
curtail 
production 
in 
order 
to 
realize 
higher 
prices, 
they 
forthwith 
free 
labor 
and 
capital 
which, 
because 
they 
are 
offered 
at 
lower 
rates, 
will 
provide 
a 
strong 
stimulus 
to 
the 
formation 
of 
new 
enterprises 
that 
must 
again 
destroy 
the 
monopolistic 
position 
of 
the 
others. 
The 
idea 
of 
a 
universal 
cartel 
and 
monopoly 
of 
the 
manufacturing 
industry 
is 
therefore 
completely 
untenable. 


Genuine 
monopolies 
can 
be 
established 
only 
by 
control 
of 
land 
or 
mineral 
resources. 
The 
notion 
that 
all 
the 
arable 
land 
on 
earth 
could 
be 
consolidated 
into 
a 
single 
world 
monopoly 
needs 
no 
further 
discussion; 
the 
only 
monopolies 
that 
we 
shall 
consider 
here 
are 
those 
originating 
in 
the 
control 
of 
useful 
minerals. 
Monopolies 
of 
this 
kind 
do, 
in 
fact, 
already 
exist 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
few 
minerals 
of 
minor 
importance, 
and 
it 
is 
at 
any 
rate 
conceivable 
that 
attempts 
to 
monopolize 
other 
minerals 
as 
well 
may 
some 
day 
prove 
successful. 
This 
would 
mean 
that 
the 
owners 
of 
such 
mines 
and 
quarries 
would 
derive 
an 
increased 
ground 
rent 
from 
them 
and 
that 
the 
consumers 
would 
restrict 
consumption 
and 
look 
for 
substitutes 
for 
the 
materials 
that 
had 
become 
more 
expensive. 
A 
world 
petroleum 
monopoly 
would 
lead 
to 
an 
increased 
demand 
for 
hydroelectric 
power, 
coal, 
etc. 
From 
the 
standpoint 
of 
world 
economy 
and 
sub 
specie 
aeternitatis, 
this 
would 
mean 
that 
we 
would 
have 
to 
be 
more 
sparing 
than 
we 
otherwise 
would 
have 
been 
in 
our 
use 
of 
those 
costly 
materials 
that 
we 
can 
only 
exhaust, 
but 
cannot 
replace, 
and 
thus 
leave 
more 
of 
them 
for 
future 
generations 
than 
would 
have 
been 
the 
case 
in 
an 
economy 
free 
of 
monopolies. 


The 
bugbear 
of 
monopoly, 
which 
is 
always 
conjured 
up 
when 
one 
speaks 
of 
the 
unhampered 
development 
of 
the 
economy, 
need 
cause 
us 
no 
disquiet. 
The 
world 
monopolies 
that 
are 
really 
feasible 
could 
concern 
only 
a 



few 
items 
of 
primary 
production. 
Whether 
their 
effect 
is 
favorable 
or 
unfavorable 
cannot 
be 
so 
easily 
decided. 
In 
the 
eyes 
of 
those 
who, 
in 
treating 
economic 
problems, 
are 
unable 
to 
free 
themselves 
from 
feelings 
of 
envy, 
these 
monopolies 
appear 
as 
pernicious 
from 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
they 
yield 
their 
owners 
increased 
profits. 
Whoever 
approaches 
the 
question 
without 
prepossessions 
will 
find 
that 
such 
monopolies 
lead 
to 
a 
more 
sparing 
use 
of 
those 
mineral 
resources 
that 
are 
at 
man’s 
disposal 
only 
in 
a 
rather 
limited 
quantity. 
If 
one 
really 
envies 
the 
monopolist 
his 
profit, 
one 
can, 
without 
danger 
and 
without 
having 
to 
expect 
any 
harmful 
economic 
consequences, 
have 
it 
pass 
into 
the 
public 
coffers 
by 
taxing 
the 
income 
from 
the 
mines. 


In 
contradistinction 
to 
these 
world 
monopolies 
are 
the 
national 
and 
international 
monopolies, 
which 
are 
of 
practical 
importance 
today 
precisely 
because 
they 
do 
not 
originate 
in 
any 
natural 
evolutionary 
tendency 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
economic 
system 
when 
it 
is 
left 
to 
itself, 
but 
are 
the 
product 
of 
antiliberal 
economic 
policies. 
Attempts 
to 
secure 
a 
monopolistic 
position 
in 
regard 
to 
certain 
articles 
are 
in 
almost 
all 
cases 
feasible 
only 
because 
tariffs 
have 
divided 
the 
world 
market 
up 
into 
small 
national 
markets. 
Besides 
these, 
the 
only 
other 
cartels 
of 
any 
consequence 
are 
those 
which 
the 
owners 
of 
certain 
natural 
resources 
are 
able 
to 
form 
because 
the 
high 
cost 
of 
transportation 
protects 
them 
against 
the 
competition 
of 
producers 
from 
other 
areas 
in 
the 
narrow 
compass 
of 
their 
own 
locality. 


It 
is 
a 
fundamental 
error, 
in 
judging 
the 
consequences 
of 
trusts, 
cartels, 
and 
enterprises 
supplying 
a 
market 
with 
one 
article 
alone, 
to 
speak 
of 
“control” 
of 
the 
market 
and 
of 
“price 
dictation” 
by 
the 
monopolist. 
The 
monopolist 
does 
not 
exercise 
any 
control, 
nor 
is 
he 
in 
a 
position 
to 
dictate 
prices. 
One 
could 
speak 
of 
control 
of 
the 
market 
or 
of 
price 
dictation 
only 
if 
the 
article 
in 
question 
were, 
in 
the 
strictest 
and 
most 
literal 
sense 
of 
the 
word, 
necessary 
for 
existence 
and 
absolutely 
irreplaceable 
by 
any 
substitute. 
This 
is 
evidently 
not 
true 
of 
any 
commodity. 
There 
is 
no 
economic 
good 
whose 
possession 
is 
indispensable 
to 
the 
existence 
of 
those 
prepared 
to 
purchase 
it 
on 
the 
market. 


What 
distinguishes 
the 
formation 
of 
a 
monopoly 
price 
from 
the 
formation 
of 
a 
competitive 
price 
is 
the 
fact 
that, 
under 
certain 
very 
special 
conditions, 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
the 
monopolist 
to 
reap 
a 
greater 
profit 
from 
the 
sale 
of 
a 
smaller 
quantity 
at 
a 
higher 
price 
(which 
we 
call 
the 
monopoly 
price) 
than 
by 
selling 
at 
the 
price 
that 
the 
market 
would 
determine 
if 
more 



sellers 
were 
in 
competition 
(the 
competitive 
price). 
The 
special 
condition 
required 
for 
the 
emergence 
of 
a 
monopoly 
price 
is 
that 
the 
reaction 
of 
the 
consumers 
to 
a 
price 
increase 
does 
not 
involve 
a 
falling 
off 
of 
demand 
so 
sharp 
as 
to 
preclude 
a 
greater 
total 
profit 
from 
fewer 
sales 
at 
higher 
prices. 
If 
it 
is 
actually 
possible 
to 
achieve 
a 
monopolistic 
position 
in 
the 
market 
and 
to 
use 
it 
to 
realize 
monopoly 
prices, 
then 
profits 
higher 
than 
average 
will 
be 
yielded 
in 
the 
branch 
of 
industry 
concerned. 


It 
may 
be 
that, 
in 
spite 
of 
these 
higher 
profits, 
new 
enterprises 
of 
the 
same 
kind 
are 
not 
undertaken 
because 
of 
the 
fear 
that, 
after 
reducing 
the 
monopoly 
price 
to 
the 
competitive 
price, 
they 
will 
not 
prove 
correspondingly 
profitable. 
One 
must, 
nevertheless, 
take 
into 
account 
the 
possibility 
that 
related 
industries, 
which 
are 
in 
a 
position 
to 
enter 
into 
production 
of 
the 
cartelized 
article 
at 
a 
relatively 
small 
cost, 
may 
appear 
as 
competitors; 
and, 
in 
any 
case, 
industries 
producing 
substitute 
commodities 
will 
be 
immediately 
at 
hand 
to 
avail 
themselves 
of 
the 
favorable 
circumstances 
for 
expanding 
their 
own 
production. 
All 
these 
factors 
make 
it 
extraordinarily 
rare 
for 
a 
monopoly 
to 
arise 
in 
a 
manufacturing 
industry 
that 
is 
not 
based 
on 
monopolistic 
control 
of 
particular 
raw 
materials. 
Where 
such 
monopolies 
do 
occur, 
they 
are 
always 
made 
possible 
only 
by 
certain 
legislative 
measures, 
such 
as 
patents 
and 
similar 
privileges, 
tariff 
regulations, 
tax 
laws, 
and 
the 
licensing 
system. 
A 
few 
decades 
ago 
people 
used 
to 
speak 
of 
a 
transportation 
monopoly. 
To 
what 
extent 
this 
monopoly 
was 
based 
on 
the 
licensing 
system 
remains 
uncertain. 
Today 
people 
generally 
do 
not 
bother 
much 
about 
it. 
The 
automobile 
and 
the 
airplane 
have 
become 
dangerous 
competitors 
of 
the 
railroads. 
But 
even 
before 
the 
appearance 
of 
these 
competitors 
the 
possibility 
of 
using 
waterways 
already 
set 
a 
definite 
limit 
to 
the 
rates 
that 
the 
railroads 
could 
venture 
to 
charge 
for 
their 
services 
on 
several 
lines. 


It 
is 
not 
only 
a 
gross 
exaggeration, 
but 
a 
misunderstanding 
of 
the 
facts, 
to 
speak, 
as 
one 
commonly 
does 
today, 
of 
the 
formation 
of 
monopolies 
as 
having 
eliminated 
an 
essential 
prerequisite 
for 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
liberal 
ideal 
of 
a 
capitalist 
society. 
Twist 
and 
turn 
the 
monopoly 
problem 
as 
one 
may, 
one 
always 
comes 
back 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
monopoly 
prices 
are 
possible 
only 
where 
there 
is 
control 
over 
natural 
resources 
of 
a 
particular 
kind 
or 
where 
legislative 
enactments 
and 
their 
administration 
create 
the 
necessary 
conditions 
for 
the 
formation 
of 
monopolies. 
In 
the 
unhampered 
development 
of 
the 
economy, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
mining 
and 
related 
branches 
of 



production, 
there 
is 
no 
tendency 
toward 
the 
exclusion 
of 
competition. 
The 
objection 
commonly 
raised 
against 
liberalism 
that 
the 
conditions 
of 
competition 
as 
they 
existed 
at 
the 
time 
when 
classical 
economics 
and 
liberal 
ideas 
were 
first 
developed 
no 
longer 
prevail 
is 
in 
no 
way 
justified. 
Only 
a 
few 
liberal 
demands 
(viz., 
free 
trade 
within 
and 
between 
nations) 
need 
to 
be 
realized 
in 
order 
to 
re-establish 
these 
conditions. 


8. 
Bureaucratization 
There 
is 
yet 
another 
sense 
in 
which 
it 
is 
commonly 
said 
that 
the 
necessary 
conditions 
for 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
liberal 
ideal 
of 
society 
no 
longer 
obtain 
today. 
In 
the 
big 
businesses 
made 
necessary 
by 
progress 
in 
the 
division 
of 
labor, 
the 
personnel 
employed 
must 
increase 
more 
and 
more. 
These 
enterprises 
must, 
therefore, 
in 
their 
conduct 
of 
business, 
become 
ever 
more 
like 
the 
government 
bureaucracy 
that 
the 
liberals 
in 
particular 
have 
made 
the 
target 
of 
their 
criticism. 
From 
day 
to 
day 
they 
become 
more 
cumbersome 
and 
less 
open 
to 
innovations. 
The 
selection 
of 
personnel 
for 
executive 
positions 
is 
no 
longer 
made 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
demonstrated 
proficiency 
on 
the 
job, 
but 
in 
accordance 
with 
purely 
formal 
criteria, 
such 
as 
educational 
background 
or 
seniority, 
and 
often 
just 
as 
a 
result 
of 
personal 
favoritism. 
Thus 
the 
distinctive 
feature 
of 
private, 
as 
opposed 
to 
public, 
enterprise 
finally 
disappears. 
If 
it 
was 
still 
justifiable 
in 
the 
age 
of 
classical 
liberalism 
to 
oppose 
government 
ownership 
on 
the 
ground 
that 
it 
paralyzes 
all 
free 
initiative 
and 
kills 
the 
joy 
of 
labor, 
it 
is 
no 
longer 
so 
today 
when 
private 
enterprises 
are 
carried 
on 
no 
less 
bureaucratically, 
pedantically, 
and 
formalistically 
than 
those 
that 
are 
publicly 
owned 
and 
operated. 


In 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
assess 
the 
validity 
of 
these 
objections, 
one 
must 
first 
be 
clear 
as 
to 
what 
is 
really 
to 
be 
understood 
by 
bureaucracy 
and 
the 
bureaucratic 
conduct 
of 
business, 
and 
just 
how 
these 
are 
distinguished 
from 
commercial 
enterprise 
and 
the 
commercial 
conduct 
of 
business. 
The 
opposition 
between 
the 
commercial 
and 
the 
bureaucratic 
mentality 
is 
the 
counterpart 
in 
the 
intellectual 
realm 
of 
the 
opposition 
between 
capitalism— 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production—and 
socialism—communal 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
Whoever 
has 
factors 
of 
production 
at 
his 
disposal, 
whether 
his 
own 
or 
those 
lent 
to 
him 
by 
their 
owners 
in 
return 
for 
some 
compensation, 
must 
always 
be 
careful 
to 
employ 
them 
in 
such 
a 



way 
as 
to 
satisfy 
those 
needs 
of 
society 
that, 
under 
the 
given 
circumstances, 
are 
the 
most 
urgent. 
If 
he 
does 
not 
do 
this, 
he 
will 
operate 
at 
a 
loss 
and 
will 
find 
himself 
at 
first 
under 
the 
necessity 
of 
curtailing 
his 
activity 
as 
owner 
and 
entrepreneur 
and 
ultimately 
ousted 
from 
that 
position 
altogether. 
He 
ceases 
to 
be 
the 
one 
or 
the 
other 
and 
has 
to 
fall 
back 
into 
the 
ranks 
of 
those 
who 
have 
only 
their 
labor 
to 
sell 
and 
who 
do 
not 
have 
the 
responsibility 
of 
guiding 
production 
into 
those 
channels 
that, 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
consumers, 
are 
the 
right 
ones. 
In 
the 
calculation 
of 
profits 
and 
losses, 
which 
constitutes 
the 
whole 
sum 
and 
substance 
of 
the 
businessman’s 
bookkeeping 
and 
accounting, 
entrepreneurs 
and 
capitalists 
possess 
a 
method 
that 
enables 
them 
to 
check, 
with 
the 
greatest 
attainable 
exactitude, 
every 
step 
in 
their 
procedure 
down 
to 
the 
smallest 
detail 
and, 
where 
possible, 
to 
see 
what 
effect 
each 
individual 
transaction 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
their 
operations 
will 
have 
on 
the 
total 
outcome 
of 
the 
enterprise. 
Monetary 
calculation 
and 
cost 
accounting 
constitute 
the 
most 
important 
intellectual 
tool 
of 
the 
capitalist 
entrepreneur, 
and 
it 
was 
no 
one 
less 
than 
Goethe 
who 
pronounced 
the 
system 
of 
double-
entry 
bookkeeping 
“one 
of 
the 
finest 
inventions 
of 
the 
human 
mind.” 
Goethe 
could 
say 
this 
because 
he 
was 
free 
from 
the 
resentment 
that 
the 
petty 
literati 
always 
foster 
against 
the 
businessman. 
It 
is 
they 
that 
form 
the 
chorus 
whose 
constant 
refrain 
is 
that 
monetary 
calculation 
and 
concern 
with 
profit 
and 
loss 
are 
the 
most 
shameful 
of 
sins. 


Monetary 
calculation, 
bookkeeping, 
and 
statistics 
on 
sales 
and 
operations 
make 
it 
possible 
for 
even 
the 
biggest 
and 
most 
complex 
business 
concerns 
to 
make 
an 
exact 
check 
on 
the 
results 
achieved 
in 
every 
single 
department 
and 
thereby 
to 
form 
a 
judgment 
on 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
the 
head 
of 
each 
department 
has 
contributed 
to 
the 
total 
success 
of 
the 
enterprise. 
Thus, 
a 
reliable 
guide 
is 
provided 
for 
determining 
the 
treatment 
to 
be 
accorded 
to 
the 
managers 
of 
the 
various 
departments. 
One 
can 
know 
what 
they 
are 
worth 
and 
how 
much 
they 
are 
to 
be 
paid. 
Advancement 
to 
higher 
and 
more 
responsible 
positions 
is 
by 
way 
of 
unquestionably 
demonstrated 
success 
in 
a 
more 
circumscribed 
sphere 
of 
action. 
And 
just 
as 
one 
is 
able 
to 
check 
on 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
manager 
of 
each 
department 
by 
means 
of 
cost 
accounting, 
so 
one 
can 
also 
scrutinize 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
enterprise 
in 
every 
single 
field 
of 
its 
over-all 
operation, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
effects 
of 
certain 
organizational 
and 
similar 
measures. 


There 
are, 
to 
be 
sure, 
limits 
to 
this 
exact 
control. 
One 
cannot 
determine 



the 
success 
or 
failure 
of 
the 
activity 
of 
each 
individual 
within 
a 
department 
as 
one 
can 
that 
of 
its 
manager. 
There 
are, 
besides, 
departments 
whose 
contribution 
to 
the 
total 
output 
cannot 
be 
comprehended 
by 
means 
of 
calculation: 
what 
a 
research 
department, 
a 
legal 
bureau, 
a 
secretariat, 
a 
statistical 
service, 
etc., 
accomplishes 
cannot 
be 
ascertained 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as, 
for 
instance, 
the 
performance 
of 
a 
particular 
sales 
or 
production 
department. 
The 
former 
may 
be 
quite 
safely 
left 
to 
the 
approximate 
estimation 
of 
the 
person 
in 
charge 
of 
the 
department, 
and 
the 
latter 
to 
that 
of 
the 
general 
manager 
of 
the 
concern; 
for 
conditions 
can 
be 
seen 
with 
relative 
clarity 
and 
those 
who 
are 
called 
upon 
to 
make 
these 
judgments 
(both 
the 
general 
management 
and 
that 
of 
the 
various 
departments) 
have 
a 
personal 
interest 
in 
their 
correctness, 
as 
their 
own 
incomes 
are 
affected 
by 
the 
productivity 
of 
the 
operations 
of 
which 
they 
are 
in 
charge. 


The 
opposite 
of 
this 
type 
of 
enterprise, 
whose 
every 
transaction 
is 
controlled 
by 
the 
calculation 
of 
profit 
and 
loss, 
is 
represented 
by 
the 
apparatus 
of 
public 
administration. 
Whether 
a 
judge 
(and 
what 
is 
true 
of 
a 
judge 
is 
true 
in 
the 
same 
way 
of 
every 
high 
administrative 
official) 
has 
discharged 
his 
duties 
better 
or 
worse 
cannot 
be 
demonstrated 
by 
any 
computation. 
There 
is 
no 
possible 
way 
of 
establishing 
by 
an 
objective 
criterion 
whether 
a 
district 
or 
a 
province 
is 
being 
administered 
well 
or 
badly, 
cheaply 
or 
expensively. 
The 
judgment 
of 
the 
activity 
of 
public 
officials 
is 
thus 
a 
matter 
of 
subjective, 
and 
therefore 
quite 
arbitrary, 
opinion. 
Even 
the 
question 
whether 
a 
particular 
bureau 
is 
necessary, 
whether 
it 
has 
too 
many 
or 
too 
few 
employees, 
and 
whether 
its 
organization 
is 
or 
is 
not 
suited 
to 
its 
purpose 
can 
be 
decided 
only 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
considerations 
that 
involve 
some 
element 
of 
subjectivity. 
There 
is 
but 
one 
field 
of 
public 
administration 
in 
which 
the 
criterion 
of 
success 
or 
failure 
is 
unquestionable: 
the 
waging 
of 
war. 
But 
even 
here 
the 
only 
thing 
certain 
is 
whether 
the 
operation 
has 
been 
crowned 
with 
success. 
The 
question 
how 
far 
the 
distribution 
of 
power 
determined 
the 
issue 
even 
before 
the 
beginning 
of 
hostilities 
and 
how 
much 
of 
the 
outcome 
is 
to 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
competence 
or 
incompetence 
of 
the 
leaders 
in 
their 
conduct 
of 
the 
operations 
and 
to 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
the 
measures 
they 
took 
cannot 
be 
strictly 
and 
precisely 
answered. 
There 
have 
been 
generals 
celebrated 
for 
their 
victories 
who, 
in 
fact, 
did 
everything 
to 
facilitate 
the 
triumph 
of 
the 
enemy 
and 
who 
owe 
their 
success 
solely 
to 
circumstances 
so 
favorable 
as 
to 
outweigh 
their 
mistakes. 
And 
vanquished 



leaders 
have 
sometimes 
been 
condemned 
whose 
genius 
had 
done 
everything 
possible 
to 
prevent 
the 
inevitable 
defeat. 


The 
manager 
of 
a 
private 
enterprise 
gives 
the 
employees 
to 
whom 
he 
assigns 
independent 
duties 
only 
one 
directive: 
to 
make 
as 
much 
profit 
as 
possible. 
Everything 
that 
he 
has 
to 
say 
to 
them 
is 
comprehended 
in 
this 
one 
order, 
and 
an 
examination 
of 
the 
accounts 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
determine 
easily 
and 
accurately 
to 
what 
extent 
they 
have 
followed 
it. 
The 
manager 
of 
a 
bureaucratic 
department 
finds 
himself 
in 
a 
quite 
different 
situation. 
He 
can 
tell 
his 
subordinates 
what 
they 
have 
to 
accomplish, 
but 
he 
is 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
ascertain 
whether 
the 
means 
employed 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
this 
result 
are 
the 
most 
appropriate 
and 
economical 
under 
the 
circumstances. 
If 
he 
is 
not 
omnipresent 
in 
all 
the 
offices 
and 
bureaus 
subordinate 
to 
him, 
he 
cannot 
judge 
whether 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
same 
result 
would 
not 
have 
been 
possible 
with 
a 
lesser 
expenditure 
of 
labor 
and 
materials. 
The 
fact 
that 
the 
result 
itself 
is 
also 
not 
amenable 
to 
numerical 
measurement, 
but 
only 
to 
approximate 
assessment, 
need 
not 
be 
discussed 
here. 
For 
we 
are 
not 
considering 
administrative 
technique 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
its 
external 
effects, 
but 
merely 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
its 
reaction 
upon 
the 
internal 
operation 
of 
the 
bureaucratic 
apparatus; 
we 
are 
concerned 
with 
the 
result 
attained, 
therefore, 
only 
in 
its 
relation 
to 
the 
expenses 
incurred. 


Because 
it 
is 
out 
of 
the 
question 
to 
undertake 
to 
determine 
this 
relationship 
by 
means 
of 
computations 
after 
the 
manner 
of 
commercial 
bookkeeping, 
the 
manager 
of 
a 
bureaucratic 
organization 
must 
provide 
his 
subordinates 
with 
instructions 
with 
which 
compliance 
is 
made 
obligatory. 
In 
these 
instructions 
provision 
is 
made, 
in 
a 
general 
way, 
for 
the 
ordinary 
and 
regular 
course 
of 
business. 
In 
all 
extraordinary 
cases, 
however, 
before 
any 
money 
is 
spent, 
permission 
must 
first 
be 
obtained 
from 
higher 
authority—a 
tedious 
and 
rather 
ineffectual 
procedure 
in 
favor 
of 
which 
all 
that 
can 
be 
said 
is 
that 
it 
is 
the 
only 
method 
possible. 
For 
if 
every 
subaltern 
bureau, 
every 
department 
head, 
every 
branch 
office, 
were 
given 
the 
right 
to 
make 
the 
expenditures 
that 
they 
deemed 
requisite, 
the 
costs 
of 
administration 
would 
soon 
soar 
without 
limit. 
One 
should 
not 
delude 
oneself 
about 
the 
fact 
that 
this 
system 
is 
seriously 
defective 
and 
very 
unsatisfactory. 
Many 
expenses 
are 
incurred 
that 
are 
superfluous, 
and 
many 
that 
would 
be 
necessary 
are 
not 
made 
because 
a 
bureaucratic 
apparatus 
cannot, 
by 
its 
very 
nature, 
adjust 
itself 
to 
circumstances 
as 
a 
commercial 
organization 
can. 



The 
effect 
of 
bureaucratization 
is 
most 
apparent 
in 
its 
representative— 
the 
bureaucrat. 
In 
a 
private 
enterprise, 
the 
hiring 
of 
labor 
is 
not 
the 
conferring 
of 
a 
favor, 
but 
a 
business 
transaction 
from 
which 
both 
parties, 
employer 
and 
employee, 
benefit. 
The 
employer 
must 
endeavor 
to 
pay 
wages 
corresponding 
in 
value 
to 
the 
labor 
performed. 
If 
he 
does 
not 
do 
this, 
he 
runs 
the 
risk 
of 
seeing 
the 
worker 
leave 
his 
employment 
for 
that 
of 
a 
better-paying 
competitor. 
The 
employee, 
in 
order 
not 
to 
lose 
his 
job, 
must 
in 
his 
turn 
endeavor 
to 
fulfill 
the 
duties 
of 
his 
position 
well 
enough 
to 
be 
worth 
his 
wages. 
Since 
employment 
is 
not 
a 
favor, 
but 
a 
business 
transaction, 
the 
employee 
does 
not 
need 
to 
fear 
that 
he 
may 
be 
discharged 
if 
he 
falls 
into 
personal 
disfavor. 
For 
the 
entrepreneur 
who 
discharges, 
for 
reasons 
of 
personal 
bias, 
a 
useful 
employee 
who 
is 
worth 
his 
pay 
harms 
only 
himself 
and 
not 
the 
worker, 
who 
can 
find 
a 
similar 
position 
elsewhere. 
There 
is 
not 
the 
slightest 
difficulty 
in 
entrusting 
to 
the 
manager 
of 
each 
department 
the 
authority 
to 
hire 
and 
fire 
employees; 
for 
under 
the 
pressure 
of 
the 
control 
exercised 
over 
his 
activities 
by 
bookkeeping 
and 
cost 
accounting 
he 
must 
see 
to 
it 
that 
his 
department 
shows 
as 
great 
a 
profit 
as 
possible, 
and 
hence 
he 
is 
obliged, 
in 
his 
own 
interest, 
to 
be 
careful 
to 
retain 
the 
best 
employees 
there. 
If 
out 
of 
spite 
he 
discharges 
someone 
whom 
he 
ought 
not 
to 
have 
discharged, 
if 
his 
actions 
are 
motivated 
by 
personal, 
and 
not 
objective, 
considerations, 
then 
it 
is 
he 
himself 
who 
must 
suffer 
the 
consequences. 
Any 
impairment 
of 
the 
success 
of 
the 
department 
headed 
by 
him 
must 
ultimately 
redound 
to 
his 
loss. 
Thus, 
the 
incorporation 
of 
the 
nonmaterial 
factor, 
labor, 
into 
the 
process 
of 
production 
takes 
place 
without 
any 
friction. 


In 
a 
bureaucratic 
organization 
things 
are 
quite 
different. 
Since 
the 
productive 
contribution 
of 
the 
individual 
department, 
and 
hence 
also 
of 
the 
individual 
employee, 
even 
when 
he 
occupies 
an 
executive 
position, 
cannot 
in 
this 
case 
be 
ascertained, 
the 
door 
is 
wide 
open 
to 
favoritism 
and 
personal 
bias 
both 
in 
appointment 
and 
remuneration. 
The 
fact 
that 
the 
intercession 
of 
influential 
persons 
plays 
a 
certain 
role 
in 
filling 
official 
positions 
in 
the 
civil 
service 
is 
not 
due 
to 
a 
peculiar 
baseness 
of 
character 
on 
the 
part 
of 
those 
responsible 
for 
filling 
these 
posts, 
but 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
from 
the 
very 
outset 
there 
is 
no 
objective 
criterion 
for 
determining 
an 
individual’s 
qualification 
for 
appointment. 
Of 
course, 
it 
is 
the 
most 
competent 
who 
ought 
to 
be 
employed, 
but 
the 
question 
is: 
Who 
is 
the 
most 
competent? 
If 
this 
question 
could 
be 
as 
easily 
answered 
as 
the 
question 
what 
an 
ironworker 
or 
a 
compositor 
is 
worth, 



there 
would 
be 
no 
problem. 
But 
since 
this 
is 
not 
the 
case, 
an 
element 
of 
arbitrariness 
is 
necessarily 
involved 
in 
comparing 
the 
qualifications 
of 
different 
individuals. 


In 
order 
to 
keep 
this 
within 
the 
narrowest 
possible 
limits, 
one 
seeks 
to 
set 
up 
formal 
conditions 
for 
appointment 
and 
promotion. 
Attainment 
to 
a 
particular 
position 
is 
made 
dependent 
on 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
certain 
educational 
requirements, 
on 
the 
passing 
of 
examinations, 
and 
on 
continued 
employment 
for 
a 
certain 
period 
of 
time 
in 
other 
positions; 
promotion 
is 
made 
dependent 
on 
years 
of 
previous 
service. 
Naturally, 
all 
these 
expedients 
are 
in 
no 
sense 
a 
substitute 
for 
the 
possibility 
of 
finding 
the 
best 
available 
man 
for 
every 
post 
by 
means 
of 
the 
calculation 
of 
profit 
and 
loss. 
It 
would 
be 
supererogatory 
to 
point 
out 
in 
particular 
that 
attendance 
at 
school, 
examinations, 
and 
seniority 
do 
not 
offer 
the 
slightest 
guarantee 
that 
the 
selection 
will 
be 
correct. 
On 
the 
contrary: 
this 
system 
from 
the 
very 
outset 
prevents 
the 
energetic 
and 
the 
competent 
from 
occupying 
positions 
in 
line 
with 
their 
powers 
and 
capabilities. 
Never 
yet 
has 
anyone 
of 
real 
worth 
risen 
to 
the 
top 
by 
way 
of 
a 
prescribed 
program 
of 
study 
and 
promotion 
in 
due 
course 
along 
the 
established 
lines. 
Even 
in 
Germany, 
which 
has 
a 
pious 
faith 
in 
her 
bureaucrats, 
the 
expression, 
“a 
perfect 
functionary,” 
is 
used 
to 
connote 
a 
spineless 
and 
ineffectual 
person, 
however 
well 
intentioned. 


Thus, 
the 
characteristic 
mark 
of 
bureaucratic 
management 
is 
that 
it 
lacks 
the 
guidance 
provided 
by 
considerations 
of 
profit 
and 
loss 
in 
judging 
the 
success 
of 
its 
operations 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
expenses 
incurred 
and 
is 
consequently 
obliged, 
in 
the 
effort 
to 
compensate 
for 
this 
deficiency, 
to 
resort 
to 
the 
entirely 
inadequate 
expedient 
of 
making 
its 
conduct 
of 
affairs 
and 
the 
hiring 
of 
its 
personnel 
subject 
to 
a 
set 
of 
formal 
prescriptions. 
All 
the 
evils 
that 
are 
commonly 
imputed 
to 
bureaucratic 
management—its 
inflexibility, 
its 
lack 
of 
resourcefulness, 
and 
its 
helplessness 
in 
the 
face 
of 
problems 
that 
are 
easily 
solved 
in 
profit-seeking 
enterprise—are 
the 
result 
of 
this 
one 
fundamental 
deficiency. 
As 
long 
as 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
state 
is 
restricted 
to 
the 
narrow 
field 
that 
liberalism 
assigns 
to 
it, 
the 
disadvantages 
of 
bureaucracy 
cannot, 
at 
any 
rate, 
make 
themselves 
too 
apparent. 
They 
become 
a 
grave 
problem 
for 
the 
whole 
economy 
only 
when 
the 
state—and 
naturally 
the 
same 
is 
true 
of 
municipalities 
and 
other 
forms 
of 
local 
government—proceeds 
to 
socialize 
the 
means 
of 
production 
and 
to 
take 
an 
active 
part 
in 
it 
or 
even 
in 
trade. 



A 
public 
enterprise 
conducted 
with 
an 
eye 
to 
maximizing 
profits 
can, 
to 
be 
sure, 
make 
use 
of 
monetary 
calculation 
as 
long 
as 
most 
business 
is 
privately 
owned 
and 
hence 
a 
market 
still 
exists 
and 
market 
prices 
are 
formed. 
The 
only 
hindrance 
to 
its 
operation 
and 
development 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
its 
managers, 
as 
functionaries 
of 
the 
state, 
do 
not 
have 
the 
personal 
interest 
in 
the 
success 
or 
failure 
of 
the 
business 
that 
is 
characteristic 
of 
the 
management 
of 
private 
enterprises. 
The 
director 
cannot, 
therefore, 
be 
given 
freedom 
to 
act 
independently 
in 
making 
crucial 
decisions. 
Since 
he 
would 
not 
suffer 
the 
losses 
that 
could 
result, 
under 
certain 
circumstances, 
from 
his 
business 
policy, 
his 
conduct 
of 
affairs 
could 
all 
too 
easily 
be 
disposed 
to 
run 
risks 
that 
would 
not 
be 
taken 
by 
a 
director 
who, 
because 
he 
must 
share 
in 
the 
loss, 
is 
genuinely 
responsible. 
His 
authority 
must, 
therefore, 
be 
in 
some 
way 
limited. 
Whether 
it 
is 
bound 
by 
a 
set 
of 
rigid 
regulations 
or 
the 
decisions 
of 
a 
control 
council 
or 
the 
consent 
of 
a 
superior 
authority, 
bureaucratic 
management 
in 
any 
case 
continues 
to 
suffer 
from 
the 
unwieldiness 
and 
the 
lack 
of 
ability 
to 
adjust 
itself 
to 
changing 
conditions 
that 
have 
everywhere 
led 
public 
enterprises 
from 
one 
failure 
to 
another. 


But, 
in 
fact, 
it 
is 
only 
seldom 
that 
a 
public 
enterprise 
aims 
at 
nothing 
but 
profit 
and 
sets 
aside 
all 
other 
considerations. 
As 
a 
rule, 
it 
is 
demanded 
of 
a 
public 
enterprise 
that 
it 
keep 
in 
mind 
certain 
“national” 
and 
other 
considerations. 
It 
is 
expected, 
for 
instance, 
in 
its 
procurement 
and 
sales 
policy, 
to 
favor 
domestic 
as 
against 
foreign 
production. 
It 
is 
demanded 
of 
state 
railways 
that 
they 
set 
a 
schedule 
of 
rates 
that 
will 
serve 
a 
specific 
commercial 
policy 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
government, 
that 
they 
construct 
and 
maintain 
lines 
that 
cannot 
be 
profitably 
operated 
simply 
in 
order 
to 
promote 
the 
economic 
development 
of 
a 
certain 
area, 
and 
that 
they 
operate 
certain 
others 
for 
strategic 
or 
similar 
reasons. 
When 
such 
factors 
play 
a 
role 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
a 
business, 
all 
control 
by 
the 
methods 
of 
cost 
accounting 
and 
the 
calculation 
of 
profit 
and 
loss 
is 
out 
of 
the 
question. 
The 
director 
of 
the 
state 
railways 
who 
presents 
an 
unfavorable 
balance 
sheet 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
year 
is 
in 
a 
position 
to 
say: 
“The 
railway 
lines 
under 
my 
supervision 
have, 
to 
be 
sure, 
operated 
at 
a 
loss 
if 
considered 
from 
the 
strictly 
commercial 
point 
of 
view 
of 
profit-seeking 
private 
enterprise; 
but 
if 
one 
takes 
into 
consideration 
such 
factors 
as 
our 
national 
economic 
and 
military 
policy, 
one 
must 
not 
forget 
that 
they 
have 
accomplished 
a 
great 
deal 
that 
does 
not 
enter 
into 
the 
calculation 
of 
profit 
and 
loss.” 
Under 
such 
circumstances 
the 
calculation 
of 
profit 
and 
loss 



has 
clearly 
lost 
all 
value 
for 
judging 
the 
success 
of 
an 
enterprise, 
so 
that— 
even 
apart 
from 
other 
factors 
having 
the 
same 
tendency—it 
must 
necessarily 
be 
managed 
quite 
as 
bureaucratically 
as, 
for 
example, 
the 
administration 
of 
a 
prison 
or 
a 
tax 
bureau. 


No 
private 
enterprise, 
whatever 
its 
size, 
can 
ever 
become 
bureaucratic 
as 
long 
as 
it 
is 
entirely 
and 
solely 
operated 
on 
a 
profit 
basis. 
Firm 
adherence 
to 
the 
entrepreneurial 
principle 
of 
aiming 
at 
the 
highest 
profit 
makes 
it 
possible 
for 
even 
the 
largest 
concern 
to 
ascertain 
with 
complete 
precision 
the 
part 
played 
by 
every 
transaction 
and 
by 
the 
activity 
of 
every 
department 
in 
contributing 
to 
the 
total 
result. 
As 
long 
as 
enterprises 
look 
only 
to 
profit, 
they 
are 
proof 
against 
all 
the 
evils 
of 
bureaucratism. 
The 
bureaucratization 
of 
privately 
owned 
enterprises 
that 
we 
see 
going 
on 
about 
us 
everywhere 
today 
is 
purely 
the 
result 
of 
interventionism, 
which 
forces 
them 
to 
take 
into 
account 
factors 
that, 
if 
they 
were 
free 
to 
determine 
their 
policies 
for 
themselves, 
would 
be 
far 
from 
playing 
any 
role 
whatsoever 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
their 
business. 
When 
a 
concern 
must 
pay 
heed 
to 
political 
prejudices 
and 
sensibilities 
of 
all 
kinds 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
being 
continually 
harassed 
by 
various 
organs 
of 
the 
state, 
it 
soon 
finds 
that 
it 
is 
no 
longer 
in 
a 
position 
to 
base 
its 
calculations 
on 
the 
solid 
ground 
of 
profit 
and 
loss. 
For 
instance, 
some 
of 
the 
public 
utility 
enterprises 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
conflicts 
with 
public 
opinion 
and 
with 
the 
legislative, 
judicial, 
and 
administrative 
organs 
of 
the 
government 
which 
it 
influences, 
make 
it 
a 
policy 
not 
to 
hire 
Catholics, 
Jews, 
atheists, 
Darwinists, 
Negroes, 
Irishmen, 
Germans, 
Italians, 
and 
all 
newly 
arrived 
immigrants. 
In 
the 
interventionist 
state, 
every 
business 
is 
under 
the 
necessity 
of 
accommodating 
itself 
to 
the 
wishes 
of 
the 
authorities 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
burdensome 
penalties. 
The 
result 
is 
that 
these 
and 
other 
considerations 
foreign 
to 
the 
profit-seeking 
principle 
of 
entrepreneurial 
management 
come 
to 
play 
an 
ever 
increasing 
role 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
business, 
while 
the 
part 
played 
by 
precise 
calculation 
and 
cost 
accounting 
concomitantly 
dwindles 
in 
significance, 
and 
private 
enterprise 
begins 
increasingly 
to 
adopt 
the 
mode 
of 
management 
of 
public 
enterprises, 
with 
their 
elaborate 
apparatus 
of 
formally 
prescribed 
rules 
and 
regulations. 
In 
a 
word, 
it 
becomes 
bureaucratized. 


Thus, 
the 
progressing 
bureaucratization 
of 
big 
business 
is 
by 
no 
means 
the 
result 
of 
an 
inexorable 
tendency 
inherent 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
capitalist 
economy. 
It 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
necessary 
consequence 
of 
adopting 
a 



policy 
of 
interventionism. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
government 
interference 
with 
their 
operations, 
even 
the 
largest 
firms 
could 
be 
run 
in 
exactly 
as 
businesslike 
a 
way 
as 
the 
small 
ones. 


[1] 
Syndicalism 
as 
an 
end 
and 
as 
a 
social 
idea 
is 
not 
to 
be 
confused 
with 
syndicalism 
as 
a 
trade-union 
tactic 
(the 
“direct 
action” 
of 
the 
French 
syndicalists). 
Of 
course, 
the 
latter 
can 
serve 
as 
a 
means 
in 
the 
struggle 
for 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
syndicalist 
ideal, 
but 
it 
can 
also 
be 
made 
to 
serve 
other 
ends 
incompatible 
with 
that 
ideal. 
One 
can 
strive, 
for 
example—and 
this 
is 
precisely 
what 
some 
of 
the 
French 
syndicalists 
hope 
to 
do—to 
achieve 
socialism 
by 
resorting 
to 
syndicalist 
tactics. 
[2] 
Even 
if 
wages 
were 
artificially 
raised 
(by 
intervention 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
government 
or 
by 
coercion 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
trade 
unions), 
simultaneously 
throughout 
the 
whole 
world 
and 
in 
all 
branches 
of 
production, 
the 
result 
would 
simply 
be 
capital 
consumption 
and 
ultimately, 
as 
a 
further 
consequence 
of 
the 
latter, 
a 
still 
further 
reduction 
in 
wages. 
I 
have 
treated 
this 
question 
in 
detail 
in 
the 
writings 
listed 
in 
the 
appendix. 

3 


Liberal 
Foreign 
Policy 


1. 
The 
Boundaries 
of 
the 
State 
For 
the 
liberal, 
there 
is 
no 
opposition 
between 
domestic 
policy 
and 
foreign 
policy, 
and 
the 
question 
so 
often 
raised 
and 
exhaustively 
discussed, 
whether 
considerations 
of 
foreign 
policy 
take 
precedence 
over 
those 
of 
domestic 
policy 
or 
vice 
versa, 
is, 
in 
his 
eyes, 
an 
idle 
one. 
For 
liberalism 
is, 
from 
the 
very 
outset, 
a 
world-embracing 
political 
concept, 
and 
the 
same 
ideas 
that 
it 
seeks 
to 
realize 
within 
a 
limited 
area 
it 
holds 
to 
be 
valid 
also 
for 
the 
larger 
sphere 
of 
world 
politics. 
If 
the 
liberal 
makes 
a 
distinction 
between 
domestic 
and 
foreign 
policy, 
he 
does 
so 
solely 
for 
purposes 
of 
convenience 
and 
classification, 
to 
subdivide 
the 
vast 
domain 
of 
political 
problems 
into 
major 
types, 
and 
not 
because 
he 
is 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
different 
principles 
are 
valid 
for 
each. 


The 
goal 
of 
the 
domestic 
policy 
of 
liberalism 
is 
the 
same 
as 
that 
of 
its 
foreign 
policy: 
peace. 
It 
aims 
at 
peaceful 
cooperation 
just 
as 
much 
between 
nations 
as 
within 
each 
nation. 
The 
starting-point 
of 
liberal 
thought 
is 
the 
recognition 
of 
the 
value 
and 
importance 
of 
human 
cooperation, 
and 
the 
whole 
policy 
and 
program 
of 
liberalism 
is 
designed 
to 
serve 
the 
purpose 
of 
maintaining 
the 
existing 
state 
of 
mutual 
cooperation 
among 
the 
members 
of 
the 
human 
race 
and 
of 
extending 
it 
still 
further. 
The 
ultimate 
ideal 
envisioned 
by 
liberalism 
is 
the 
perfect 
cooperation 
of 
all 
mankind, 
taking 
place 
peacefully 
and 
without 
friction. 
Liberal 
thinking 
always 
has 
the 
whole 
of 
humanity 
in 
view 
and 
not 
just 
parts. 
It 
does 
not 
stop 
at 
limited 
groups; 
it 
does 
not 
end 
at 
the 
border 
of 
the 
village, 
of 
the 
province, 
of 
the 
nation, 
or 
of 
the 
continent. 
Its 
thinking 
is 
cosmopolitan 
and 
ecumenical: 
it 
takes 
in 
all 
men 
and 
the 
whole 
world. 
Liberalism 
is, 
in 
this 
sense, 
humanism; 
and 
the 
liberal, 
a 
citizen 
of 
the 
world, 
a 
cosmopolite. 


Today, 
when 
the 
world 
is 
dominated 
by 
antiliberal 
ideas, 
cosmopolitanism 
is 
suspect 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
masses. 
In 
Germany 
there 
are 



overzealous 
patriots 
who 
cannot 
forgive 
the 
great 
German 
poets, 
especially 
Goethe, 
whose 
thinking 
and 
feeling, 
instead 
of 
being 
confined 
by 
national 
bounds, 
had 
a 
cosmopolitan 
orientation. 
It 
is 
thought 
that 
an 
irreconcilable 
conflict 
exists 
between 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
nation 
and 
those 
of 
mankind 
and 
that 
one 
who 
directs 
his 
aspirations 
and 
endeavors 
toward 
the 
welfare 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
humanity 
thereby 
disregards 
the 
interests 
of 
his 
own 
nation. 
No 
belief 
could 
be 
more 
deeply 
mistaken. 
The 
German 
who 
works 
for 
the 
good 
of 
all 
mankind 
no 
more 
injures 
the 
particular 
interests 
of 
his 
compatriots— 
i.e., 
those 
of 
his 
fellow 
men 
with 
whom 
he 
shares 
a 
common 
land 
and 
language 
and 
with 
whom 
he 
often 
forms 
an 
ethnic 
and 
spiritual 
community 
as 
well—than 
one 
who 
works 
for 
the 
good 
of 
the 
whole 
German 
nation 
injures 
the 
interests 
of 
his 
own 
home 
town. 
For 
the 
individual 
has 
just 
as 
much 
of 
an 
interest 
in 
the 
prosperity 
of 
the 
whole 
world 
as 
he 
has 
in 
the 
blooming 
and 
flourishing 
of 
the 
local 
community 
in 
which 
he 
lives. 


The 
chauvinistic 
nationalists, 
who 
maintain 
that 
irreconcilable 
conflicts 
of 
interests 
exist 
among 
the 
various 
nations 
and 
who 
seek 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
policy 
aimed 
at 
securing, 
by 
force 
if 
need 
be, 
the 
supremacy 
of 
their 
own 
nation 
over 
all 
others, 
are 
generally 
most 
emphatic 
in 
insisting 
on 
the 
necessity 
and 
utility 
of 
internal 
national 
unity. 
The 
greater 
the 
stress 
they 
place 
on 
the 
necessity 
of 
war 
against 
foreign 
nations, 
the 
more 
urgently 
do 
they 
call 
for 
peace 
and 
concord 
among 
the 
members 
of 
their 
own 
nation. 
Now 
this 
demand 
for 
domestic 
unity 
the 
liberal 
by 
no 
means 
opposes. 
On 
the 
contrary: 
the 
demand 
for 
peace 
within 
each 
nation 
was 
itself 
an 
outcome 
of 
liberal 
thinking 
and 
attained 
to 
prominence 
only 
as 
the 
liberal 
ideas 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
century 
came 
to 
be 
more 
widely 
accepted. 
Before 
the 
liberal 
philosophy, 
with 
its 
unconditional 
extolment 
of 
peace, 
gained 
ascendancy 
over 
men’s 
minds, 
the 
waging 
of 
war 
was 
not 
confined 
to 
conflicts 
between 
one 
country 
and 
another. 
Nations 
were 
themselves 
torn 
by 
continual 
civil 
strife 
and 
sanguinary 
internal 
struggles. 
In 
the 
eighteenth 
century 
Briton 
still 
stood 
arrayed 
in 
battle 
against 
Briton 
at 
Culloden, 
and 
even 
as 
late 
as 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
in 
Germany, 
while 
Prussia 
waged 
war 
against 
Austria, 
other 
German 
states 
joined 
in 
the 
fighting 
on 
both 
sides. 
At 
that 
time 
Prussia 
saw 
nothing 
wrong 
in 
fighting 
on 
the 
side 
of 
Italy 
against 
German 
Austria, 
and, 
in 
1870, 
only 
the 
rapid 
progress 
of 
events 
prevented 
Austria 
from 
joining 
the 
French 
in 
the 
war 
against 
Prussia 
and 
its 
allies. 
Many 
of 
the 
victories 
of 
which 
the 
Prussian 
army 
is 
so 
proud 
were 
won 
by 
Prussian 
troops 



over 
those 
of 
other 
German 
states. 
It 
was 
liberalism 
that 
first 
taught 
the 
nations 
to 
preserve 
in 
their 
internal 
conduct 
of 
affairs 
the 
peace 
that 
it 
desires 
to 
teach 
them 
to 
keep 
also 
in 
their 
relations 
with 
other 
countries. 


It 
is 
from 
the 
fact 
of 
the 
international 
division 
of 
labor 
that 
liberalism 
derives 
the 
decisive, 
irrefutable 
argument 
against 
war. 
The 
division 
of 
labor 
has 
for 
a 
long 
time 
now 
gone 
beyond 
the 
boundaries 
of 
any 
one 
nation. 
No 
civilized 
nation 
today 
satisfies 
its 
need 
as 
a 
self-sufficient 
community 
directly 
from 
its 
own 
production. 
All 
are 
obliged 
to 
obtain 
goods 
from 
abroad 
and 
to 
pay 
for 
them 
by 
exporting 
domestic 
products. 
Anything 
that 
would 
have 
the 
effect 
of 
preventing 
or 
stopping 
the 
international 
exchange 
of 
goods 
would 
do 
immense 
damage 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
human 
civilization 
and 
undermine 
the 
wellbeing, 
indeed, 
the 
very 
basis 
of 
existence, 
of 
millions 
upon 
millions 
of 
people. 
In 
an 
age 
in 
which 
nations 
are 
mutually 
dependent 
on 
products 
of 
foreign 
provenance, 
wars 
can 
no 
longer 
be 
waged. 
Since 
any 
stoppage 
in 
the 
flow 
of 
imports 
could 
have 
a 
decisive 
effect 
on 
the 
outcome 
of 
a 
war 
waged 
by 
a 
nation 
involved 
in 
the 
international 
division 
of 
labor, 
a 
policy 
that 
wishes 
to 
take 
into 
consideration 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
war 
must 
endeavor 
to 
make 
the 
national 
economy 
self-sufficient, 
i.e., 
it 
must, 
even 
in 
time 
of 
peace, 
aim 
at 
making 
the 
international 
division 
of 
labor 
come 
to 
an 
end 
at 
its 
own 
borders. 
If 
Germany 
wished 
to 
withdraw 
from 
the 
international 
division 
of 
labor 
and 
attempted 
to 
satisfy 
all 
its 
needs 
directly 
through 
domestic 
production, 
the 
total 
annual 
product 
of 
German 
labor 
would 
diminish, 
and 
thus 
the 
well-being, 
the 
standard 
of 
living, 
and 
the 
cultural 
level 
of 
the 
German 
people 
would 
decline 
considerably. 


2. 
The 
Right 
of 
Self-Determination 
It 
has 
already 
been 
pointed 
out 
that 
a 
country 
can 
enjoy 
domestic 
peace 
only 
when 
a 
democratic 
constitution 
provides 
the 
guarantee 
that 
the 
adjustment 
of 
the 
government 
to 
the 
will 
of 
the 
citizens 
can 
take 
place 
without 
friction. 
Nothing 
else 
is 
required 
than 
the 
consistent 
application 
of 
the 
same 
principle 
in 
order 
to 
assure 
international 
peace 
as 
well. 


The 
liberals 
of 
an 
earlier 
age 
thought 
that 
the 
peoples 
of 
the 
world 
were 
peaceable 
by 
nature 
and 
that 
only 
monarchs 
desire 
war 
in 
order 
to 
increase 
their 
power 
and 
wealth 
by 
the 
conquest 
of 
provinces. 
They 
believed, 
therefore, 
that 
to 
assure 
lasting 
peace 
it 
was 
sufficient 
to 
replace 
the 
rule 
of 



dynastic 
princes 
by 
governments 
dependent 
on 
the 
people. 
If 
a 
democratic 
republic 
finds 
that 
its 
existing 
boundaries, 
as 
shaped 
by 
the 
course 
of 
history 
before 
the 
transition 
to 
liberalism, 
no 
longer 
correspond 
to 
the 
political 
wishes 
of 
the 
people, 
they 
must 
be 
peacefully 
changed 
to 
conform 
to 
the 
results 
of 
a 
plebiscite 
expressing 
the 
people’s 
will. 
It 
must 
always 
be 
possible 
to 
shift 
the 
boundaries 
of 
the 
state 
if 
the 
will 
of 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
an 
area 
to 
attach 
themselves 
to 
a 
state 
other 
than 
the 
one 
to 
which 
they 
presently 
belong 
has 
made 
itself 
clearly 
known. 
In 
the 
seventeenth 
and 
eighteenth 
centuries, 
the 
Russian 
Czars 
incorporated 
into 
their 
empire 
large 
areas 
whose 
population 
had 
never 
felt 
the 
desire 
to 
belong 
to 
the 
Russian 
state. 
Even 
if 
the 
Russian 
Empire 
had 
adopted 
a 
completely 
democratic 
constitution, 
the 
wishes 
of 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
these 
territories 
would 
not 
have 
been 
satisfied, 
because 
they 
simply 
did 
not 
desire 
to 
associate 
themselves 
in 
any 
bond 
of 
political 
union 
with 
the 
Russians. 
Their 
democratic 
demand 
was: 
freedom 
from 
the 
Russian 
Empire; 
the 
formation 
of 
an 
independent 
Poland, 
Finland, 
Latvia, 
Lithuania, 
etc. 
The 
fact 
that 
these 
demands 
and 
similar 
ones 
on 
the 
part 
of 
other 
peoples 
(e.g., 
the 
Italians, 
the 
Germans 
in 
Schleswig-Holstein, 
the 
Slavs 
in 
the 
Hapsburg 
Empire) 
could 
be 
satisfied 
only 
by 
recourse 
to 
arms 
was 
the 
most 
important 
cause 
of 
all 
the 
wars 
that 
have 
been 
fought 
in 
Europe 
since 
the 
Congress 
of 
Vienna. 


The 
right 
of 
self-determination 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
question 
of 
membership 
in 
a 
state 
thus 
means: 
whenever 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
a 
particular 
territory, 
whether 
it 
be 
a 
single 
village, 
a 
whole 
district, 
or 
a 
series 
of 
adjacent 
districts, 
make 
it 
known, 
by 
a 
freely 
conducted 
plebiscite, 
that 
they 
no 
longer 
wish 
to 
remain 
united 
to 
the 
state 
to 
which 
they 
belong 
at 
the 
time, 
but 
wish 
either 
to 
form 
an 
independent 
state 
or 
to 
attach 
themselves 
to 
some 
other 
state, 
their 
wishes 
are 
to 
be 
respected 
and 
complied 
with. 
This 
is 
the 
only 
feasible 
and 
effective 
way 
of 
preventing 
revolutions 
and 
civil 
and 
international 
wars. 


To 
call 
this 
right 
of 
self-determination 
the 
“right 
of 
self-determination 
of 
nations” 
is 
to 
misunderstand 
it. 
It 
is 
not 
the 
right 
of 
self-determination 
of 
a 
delimited 
national 
unit, 
but 
the 
right 
of 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
every 
territory 
to 
decide 
on 
the 
state 
to 
which 
they 
wish 
to 
belong. 
This 
misunderstanding 
is 
even 
more 
grievous 
when 
the 
expression 
“self-determination 
of 
nations” 
is 
taken 
to 
mean 
that 
a 
national 
state 
has 
the 
right 
to 
detach 
and 
incorporate 
into 
itself 
against 
the 
will 
of 
the 
inhabitants 
parts 
of 
the 
nation 
that 
belong 
to 
the 
territory 
of 
another 
state. 
It 
is 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
right 
of 
self-determination 
of 



nations 
understood 
in 
this 
sense 
that 
the 
Italian 
Fascists 
seek 
to 
justify 
their 
demand 
that 
the 
canton 
Tessin 
and 
parts 
of 
other 
cantons 
be 
detached 
from 
Switzerland 
and 
united 
to 
Italy, 
even 
though 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
these 
cantons 
have 
no 
such 
desire. 
A 
similar 
position 
is 
taken 
by 
some 
of 
the 
advocates 
of 
Pan-Germanism 
in 
regard 
to 
German 
Switzerland 
and 
the 
Netherlands. 


However, 
the 
right 
of 
self-determination 
of 
which 
we 
speak 
is 
not 
the 
right 
of 
self-determination 
of 
nations, 
but 
rather 
the 
right 
of 
self-
determination 
of 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
every 
territory 
large 
enough 
to 
form 
an 
independent 
administrative 
unit. 
If 
it 
were 
in 
any 
way 
possible 
to 
grant 
this 
right 
of 
self-determination 
to 
every 
individual 
person, 
it 
would 
have 
to 
be 
done. 
This 
is 
impracticable 
only 
because 
of 
compelling 
technical 
considerations, 
which 
make 
it 
necessary 
that 
a 
region 
be 
governed 
as 
a 
single 
administrative 
unit 
and 
that 
the 
right 
of 
self-determination 
be 
restricted 
to 
the 
will 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
areas 
large 
enough 
to 
count 
as 
territorial 
units 
in 
the 
administration 
of 
the 
country. 


So 
far 
as 
the 
right 
of 
self-determination 
was 
given 
effect 
at 
all, 
and 
wherever 
it 
would 
have 
been 
permitted 
to 
take 
effect, 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
and 
twentieth 
centuries, 
it 
led 
or 
would 
have 
led 
to 
the 
formation 
of 
states 
composed 
of 
a 
single 
nationality 
(i.e., 
people 
speaking 
the 
same 
language) 
and 
to 
the 
dissolution 
of 
states 
composed 
of 
several 
nationalities, 
but 
only 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
free 
choice 
of 
those 
entitled 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
plebiscite. 
The 
formation 
of 
states 
comprising 
all 
the 
members 
of 
a 
national 
group 
was 
the 
result 
of 
the 
exercise 
of 
the 
right 
of 
self-determination, 
not 
its 
purpose. 
If 
some 
members 
of 
a 
nation 
feel 
happier 
politically 
independent 
than 
as 
a 
part 
of 
a 
state 
composed 
of 
all 
the 
members 
of 
the 
same 
linguistic 
group, 
one 
may, 
of 
course, 
attempt 
to 
change 
their 
political 
ideas 
by 
persuasion 
in 
order 
to 
win 
them 
over 
to 
the 
principle 
of 
nationality, 
according 
to 
which 
all 
members 
of 
the 
same 
linguistic 
group 
should 
form 
a 
single, 
independent 
state. 
If, 
however, 
one 
seeks 
to 
determine 
their 
political 
fate 
against 
their 
will 
by 
appealing 
to 
an 
alleged 
higher 
right 
of 
the 
nation, 
one 
violates 
the 
right 
of 
self-determination 
no 
less 
effectively 
than 
by 
practicing 
any 
other 
form 
of 
oppression. 
A 
partition 
of 
Switzerland 
among 
Germany, 
France, 
and 
Italy, 
even 
if 
it 
were 
performed 
exactly 
according 
to 
linguistic 
boundaries, 
would 
be 
just 
as 
gross 
a 
violation 
of 
the 
right 
of 
self-
determination 
as 
was 
the 
partition 
of 
Poland. 



3. 
The 
Political 
Foundations 
of 
Peace 
One 
would 
think 
that 
after 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
World 
War 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
necessity 
of 
perpetual 
peace 
would 
have 
become 
increasingly 
common. 
However, 
it 
is 
still 
not 
appreciated 
that 
everlasting 
peace 
can 
be 
achieved 
only 
by 
putting 
the 
liberal 
program 
into 
effect 
generally 
and 
holding 
to 
it 
constantly 
and 
consistently 
and 
that 
the 
World 
War 
was 
nothing 
but 
the 
natural 
and 
necessary 
consequence 
of 
the 
antiliberal 
policies 
of 
the 
last 
decades. 


A 
senseless 
and 
thoughtless 
slogan 
makes 
capitalism 
responsible 
for 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
war. 
The 
connection 
between 
the 
latter 
and 
the 
policy 
of 
protectionism 
is 
clearly 
evident, 
and, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
what 
is 
certainly 
a 
grievous 
ignorance 
of 
the 
facts, 
the 
protective 
tariff 
is 
identified 
outright 
with 
capitalism. 
People 
forget 
that 
only 
a 
short 
time 
ago 
all 
the 
nationalistic 
publications 
were 
filled 
with 
violent 
diatribes 
against 
international 
capital 
(“finance 
capital” 
and 
the 
“international 
gold 
trust”) 
for 
being 
without 
a 
country, 
for 
opposing 
protective 
tariffs, 
for 
being 
averse 
to 
war 
and 
inclined 
toward 
peace. 
It 
is 
altogether 
absurd 
to 
hold 
the 
armaments 
industry 
responsible 
for 
the 
outbreak 
of 
the 
war. 
The 
armaments 
industry 
has 
arisen 
and 
grown 
to 
a 
considerable 
size 
because 
governments 
and 
peoples 
bent 
on 
war 
demanded 
weapons. 
It 
would 
be 
really 
preposterous 
to 
suppose 
that 
the 
nations 
turned 
to 
imperialistic 
policies 
as 
a 
favor 
to 
the 
ordnance 
manufacturers. 
The 
armaments 
industry, 
like 
every 
other, 
arose 
in 
order 
to 
satisfy 
a 
demand. 
If 
the 
nations 
had 
preferred 
other 
things 
to 
bullets 
and 
explosives, 
then 
the 
factory-owners 
would 
have 
produced 
the 
former 
instead 
of 
the 
materials 
of 
war. 


One 
can 
assume 
that 
the 
desire 
for 
peace 
is 
today 
universal. 
But 
the 
peoples 
of 
the 
world 
are 
not 
at 
all 
clear 
as 
to 
what 
conditions 
would 
have 
to 
be 
fulfilled 
in 
order 
to 
secure 
peace. 


If 
the 
peace 
is 
not 
to 
be 
disturbed, 
all 
incentive 
for 
aggression 
must 
be 
eliminated. 
A 
world 
order 
must 
be 
established 
in 
which 
nations 
and 
national 
groups 
are 
so 
satisfied 
with 
living 
conditions 
that 
they 
will 
not 
feel 
impelled 
to 
resort 
to 
the 
desperate 
expedient 
of 
war. 
The 
liberal 
does 
not 
expect 
to 
abolish 
war 
by 
preaching 
and 
moralizing. 
He 
seeks 
to 
create 
the 
social 
conditions 
that 
will 
eliminate 
the 
causes 
of 
war. 



The 
first 
requirement 
in 
this 
regard 
is 
private 
property. 
When 
private 
property 
must 
be 
respected 
even 
in 
time 
of 
war, 
when 
the 
victor 
is 
not 
entitled 
to 
appropriate 
to 
himself 
the 
property 
of 
private 
persons, 
and 
the 
appropriation 
of 
public 
property 
has 
no 
great 
significance 
because 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
prevails 
everywhere, 
an 
important 
motive 
for 
waging 
war 
has 
already 
been 
excluded. 
However, 
this 
is 
far 
from 
being 
enough 
to 
guarantee 
peace. 
So 
that 
the 
exercise 
of 
the 
right 
of 
self-
determination 
may 
not 
be 
reduced 
to 
a 
farce, 
political 
institutions 
must 
be 
such 
as 
to 
render 
the 
transference 
of 
sovereignty 
over 
a 
territory 
from 
one 
government 
to 
another 
a 
matter 
of 
the 
least 
possible 
significance, 
involving 
no 
advantage 
or 
disadvantage 
for 
anyone. 
People 
do 
not 
have 
a 
correct 
conception 
of 
what 
this 
requires. 
It 
is 
therefore 
necessary 
to 
make 
it 
clear 
by 
a 
few 
examples. 


Examine 
a 
map 
of 
linguistic 
and 
national 
groups 
in 
Central 
or 
Eastern 
Europe 
and 
notice 
how 
often, 
for 
example, 
in 
northern 
and 
western 
Bohemia, 
boundaries 
between 
them 
are 
crossed 
by 
railway 
lines. 
Here, 
under 
conditions 
of 
interventionism 
and 
etatism, 
there 
is 
no 
way 
of 
making 
the 
borders 
of 
the 
state 
correspond 
to 
the 
linguistic 
frontier. 
It 
will 
not 
do 
to 
operate 
a 
Czech 
state 
railroad 
on 
the 
soil 
of 
the 
German 
state, 
and 
it 
will 
do 
even 
less 
to 
run 
a 
railroad 
line 
that 
is 
under 
a 
different 
management 
every 
few 
miles. 
It 
would 
be 
just 
as 
unthinkable 
after 
every 
few 
minutes 
or 
quarter 
of 
an 
hour 
on 
a 
railroad 
trip 
to 
have 
to 
face 
a 
tariff 
barrier 
with 
all 
its 
formalities. 
It 
is 
thus 
easy 
to 
understand 
why 
etatists 
and 
interventionists 
reach 
the 
conclusion 
that 
the 
“geographic” 
or 
“economic” 
unity 
of 
such 
areas 
must 
not 
be 
“ruptured” 
and 
that 
the 
territory 
in 
question 
must 
therefore 
be 
placed 
under 
the 
sovereignty 
of 
a 
single 
“ruler.” 
(Obviously, 
every 
nation 
seeks 
to 
prove 
that 
it 
alone 
is 
entitled 
and 
competent 
to 
play 
the 
role 
of 
ruler 
under 
such 
circumstances.) 
For 
liberalism 
there 
is 
no 
problem 
here 
at 
all. 
Private 
railroads, 
if 
quite 
free 
of 
government 
interference, 
can 
traverse 
the 
territory 
of 
many 
states 
without 
any 
trouble. 
If 
there 
are 
no 
tariff 
boundaries 
and 
no 
limitations 
on 
the 
movement 
of 
persons, 
animals, 
or 
goods, 
then 
it 
is 
of 
no 
consequence 
whether 
a 
train 
ride 
in 
a 
few 
hours 
crosses 
over 
the 
borders 
of 
the 
state 
more 
or 
less 
often. 


The 
linguistic 
map 
also 
reveals 
the 
existence 
of 
national 
enclaves. 
Without 
any 
land 
connection 
of 
the 
same 
nationality 
with 
the 
main 
body 
of 
their 
people, 
compatriots 
dwell 
together 
in 
closed-off 
settlements 
or 
linguistic 



islands. 
Under 
present 
political 
conditions, 
they 
cannot 
be 
incorporated 
into 
the 
mother 
country. 
The 
fact 
that 
the 
area 
encompassed 
by 
the 
state 
is 
today 
protected 
by 
tariff 
walls 
makes 
unbroken 
territorial 
continuity 
a 
political 
necessity. 
A 
small 
“foreign 
possession,” 
in 
being 
isolated 
from 
the 
immediately 
adjacent 
territory 
by 
tariffs 
and 
other 
measures 
of 
protectionism, 
would 
be 
exposed 
to 
economic 
strangulation. 
But 
once 
there 
is 
free 
trade 
and 
the 
state 
restricts 
itself 
to 
the 
preservation 
of 
private 
property, 
nothing 
is 
simpler 
than 
the 
solution 
of 
this 
problem. 
No 
linguistic 
island 
then 
has 
to 
acquiesce 
in 
the 
infringement 
of 
its 
rights 
as 
a 
nation 
merely 
because 
it 
is 
not 
connected 
to 
the 
main 
body 
of 
its 
own 
people 
by 
a 
territorial 
bridge 
inhabited 
by 
its 
fellow 
nationals. 


The 
notorious 
“problem 
of 
the 
corridor” 
also 
arises 
only 
in 
an 
imperialist-etatist-interventionist 
system. 
An 
inland 
country 
believes 
that 
it 
needs 
a 
“corridor” 
to 
the 
sea 
in 
order 
to 
keep 
its 
foreign 
trade 
free 
of 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
interventionist 
and 
etatist 
policies 
of 
the 
countries 
whose 
territories 
separate 
it 
from 
the 
sea. 
If 
free 
trade 
were 
the 
rule, 
it 
would 
be 
hard 
to 
see 
what 
advantage 
an 
inland 
country 
could 
expect 
from 
the 
possession 
of 
a 
“corridor.” 


Transfer 
from 
one 
“economic 
zone” 
(in 
the 
etatist 
sense) 
to 
another 
has 
serious 
economic 
consequences. 
One 
need 
only 
think, 
for 
instance, 
of 
the 
cotton 
industry 
of 
upper 
Alsatia, 
which 
has 
twice 
had 
to 
undergo 
this 
experience, 
or 
the 
Polish 
textile 
industry 
of 
Upper 
Silesia, 
etc. 
If 
a 
change 
in 
the 
political 
affiliation 
of 
a 
territory 
involves 
advantages 
or 
disadvantages 
for 
its 
inhabitants, 
then 
their 
freedom 
to 
vote 
for 
the 
state 
to 
which 
they 
really 
wish 
to 
belong 
is 
essentially 
limited. 
One 
can 
speak 
of 
genuine 
self-
determination 
only 
if 
the 
decision 
of 
each 
individual 
stems 
from 
his 
own 
free 
will, 
and 
not 
from 
fear 
of 
loss 
or 
hope 
of 
profit. 
A 
capitalist 
world 
organized 
on 
liberal 
principles 
knows 
no 
separate 
“economic” 
zones. 
In 
such 
a 
world, 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
earth’s 
surface 
forms 
a 
single 
economic 
territory. 


The 
right 
of 
self-determination 
works 
to 
the 
advantage 
only 
of 
those 
who 
comprise 
the 
majority. 
In 
order 
to 
protect 
minorities 
as 
well, 
domestic 
measures 
are 
required, 
of 
which 
we 
shall 
first 
consider 
those 
involving 
the 
national 
policy 
in 
regard 
to 
education. 


In 
most 
countries 
today 
school 
attendance, 
or 
at 
least 
private 
instruction, 
is 
compulsory. 
Parents 
are 
obliged 
to 
send 
their 
children 
to 
school 
for 
a 
certain 
number 
of 
years 
or, 
in 
lieu 
of 
this 
public 
instruction 
at 
school, 
to 
have 



them 
given 
equivalent 
instruction 
at 
home. 
It 
is 
pointless 
to 
go 
into 
the 
reasons 
that 
were 
advanced 
for 
and 
against 
compulsory 
education 
when 
the 
matter 
was 
still 
a 
live 
issue. 
They 
do 
not 
have 
the 
slightest 
relevance 
to 
the 
problem 
as 
it 
exists 
today. 
There 
is 
only 
one 
argument 
that 
has 
any 
bearing 
at 
all 
on 
this 
question, 
viz., 
that 
continued 
adherence 
to 
a 
policy 
of 
compulsory 
education 
is 
utterly 
incompatible 
with 
efforts 
to 
establish 
lasting 
peace. 


The 
inhabitants 
of 
London, 
Paris, 
and 
Berlin 
will 
no 
doubt 
find 
such 
a 
statement 
completely 
incredible. 
What 
in 
the 
world 
does 
compulsory 
education 
have 
to 
do 
with 
war 
and 
peace? 
One 
must 
not, 
however, 
judge 
this 
question, 
as 
one 
does 
so 
many 
others, 
exclusively 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
peoples 
of 
Western 
Europe. 
In 
London, 
Paris, 
and 
Berlin, 
the 
problem 
of 
compulsory 
education 
is, 
to 
be 
sure, 
easily 
solved. 
In 
these 
cities 
no 
doubt 
can 
arise 
as 
to 
which 
language 
is 
to 
be 
used 
in 
giving 
instruction. 
The 
population 
that 
lives 
in 
these 
cities 
and 
sends 
its 
children 
to 
school 
may 
be 
considered, 
by 
and 
large, 
of 
homogeneous 
nationality. 
But 
even 
the 
non-
English-speaking 
people 
who 
live 
in 
London 
find 
it 
in 
the 
obvious 
interest 
of 
their 
children 
that 
instruction 
is 
given 
in 
English 
and 
in 
no 
other 
language, 
and 
things 
are 
not 
different 
in 
Paris 
and 
Berlin. 


However, 
the 
problem 
of 
compulsory 
education 
has 
an 
entirely 
different 
significance 
in 
those 
extensive 
areas 
in 
which 
peoples 
speaking 
different 
languages 
live 
together 
side 
by 
side 
and 
intermingled 
in 
polyglot 
confusion. 
Here 
the 
question 
of 
which 
language 
is 
to 
be 
made 
the 
basis 
of 
instruction 
assumes 
crucial 
importance. 
A 
decision 
one 
way 
or 
the 
other 
can, 
over 
the 
years, 
determine 
the 
nationality 
of 
a 
whole 
area. 
The 
school 
can 
alienate 
children 
from 
the 
nationality 
to 
which 
their 
parents 
belong 
and 
can 
be 
used 
as 
a 
means 
of 
oppressing 
whole 
nationalities. 
Whoever 
controls 
the 
schools 
has 
the 
power 
to 
injure 
other 
nationalities 
and 
to 
benefit 
his 
own. 


It 
is 
no 
solution 
of 
this 
problem 
to 
suggest 
that 
each 
child 
be 
sent 
to 
the 
school 
in 
which 
the 
language 
of 
his 
parents 
is 
spoken. 
First 
of 
all, 
even 
apart 
from 
the 
problem 
posed 
by 
children 
of 
mixed 
linguistic 
background, 
it 
is 
not 
always 
easy 
to 
decide 
what 
the 
language 
of 
the 
parents 
is. 
In 
polyglot 
areas 
many 
persons 
are 
required 
by 
their 
profession 
to 
make 
use 
of 
all 
the 
languages 
spoken 
in 
the 
country. 
Besides, 
it 
is 
often 
not 
possible 
for 
an 
individual—again 
out 
of 
regard 
for 
his 
means 
of 
livelihood—to 
declare 
himself 
openly 
for 
one 
or 
another 
nationality. 
Under 
a 
system 
of 
interventionism, 
it 
could 
cost 
him 
the 
patronage 
of 
customers 
belonging 
to 



other 
nationalities 
or 
a 
job 
with 
an 
entrepreneur 
of 
a 
different 
nationality. 
Then 
again, 
there 
are 
many 
parents 
who 
would 
even 
prefer 
to 
send 
their 
children 
to 
the 
schools 
of 
another 
nationality 
than 
their 
own 
because 
they 
value 
the 
advantages 
of 
bilingualism 
or 
assimilation 
to 
the 
other 
nationality 
more 
highly 
than 
loyalty 
to 
their 
own 
people. 
If 
one 
leaves 
to 
the 
parents 
the 
choice 
of 
the 
school 
to 
which 
they 
wish 
to 
send 
their 
children, 
then 
one 
exposes 
them 
to 
every 
conceivable 
form 
of 
political 
coercion. 
In 
all 
areas 
of 
mixed 
nationality, 
the 
school 
is 
a 
political 
prize 
of 
the 
highest 
importance. 
It 
cannot 
be 
deprived 
of 
its 
political 
character 
as 
long 
as 
it 
remains 
a 
public 
and 
compulsory 
institution. 
There 
is, 
in 
fact, 
only 
one 
solution: 
the 
state, 
the 
government, 
the 
laws 
must 
not 
in 
any 
way 
concern 
themselves 
with 
schooling 
or 
education. 
Public 
funds 
must 
not 
be 
used 
for 
such 
purposes. 
The 
rearing 
and 
instruction 
of 
youth 
must 
be 
left 
entirely 
to 
parents 
and 
to 
private 
associations 
and 
institutions. 


It 
is 
better 
that 
a 
number 
of 
boys 
grow 
up 
without 
formal 
education 
than 
that 
they 
enjoy 
the 
benefit 
of 
schooling 
only 
to 
run 
the 
risk, 
once 
they 
have 
grown 
up, 
of 
being 
killed 
or 
maimed. 
A 
healthy 
illiterate 
is 
always 
better 
than 
a 
literate 
cripple. 


But 
even 
if 
we 
eliminate 
the 
spiritual 
coercion 
exercised 
by 
compulsory 
education, 
we 
should 
still 
be 
far 
from 
having 
done 
everything 
that 
is 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
remove 
all 
the 
sources 
of 
friction 
between 
the 
nationalities 
living 
in 
polyglot 
territories. 
The 
school 
is 
one 
means 
of 
oppressing 
nationalities—perhaps 
the 
most 
dangerous, 
in 
our 
opinion—but 
it 
certainly 
is 
not 
the 
only 
means. 
Every 
interference 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
government 
in 
economic 
life 
can 
become 
a 
means 
of 
persecuting 
the 
members 
of 
nationalities 
speaking 
a 
language 
different 
from 
that 
of 
the 
ruling 
group. 
For 
this 
reason, 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
preserving 
peace, 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
government 
must 
be 
limited 
to 
the 
sphere 
in 
which 
it 
is, 
in 
the 
strictest 
sense 
of 
the 
word, 
indispensable. 


We 
cannot 
do 
without 
the 
apparatus 
of 
government 
in 
protecting 
and 
preserving 
the 
life, 
liberty, 
property, 
and 
health 
of 
the 
individual. 
But 
even 
the 
judicial 
and 
police 
activities 
performed 
in 
the 
service 
of 
these 
ends 
can 
become 
dangerous 
in 
areas 
where 
any 
basis 
at 
all 
can 
be 
found 
for 
discriminating 
between 
one 
group 
and 
another 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
official 
business. 
Only 
in 
countries 
where 
there 
is 
no 
particular 
incentive 
for 
partiality 
will 
there 
generally 
be 
no 
reason 
to 
fear 
that 
a 
magistrate 
who 
is 
supposed 
to 



apply 
the 
established 
laws 
for 
the 
protection 
of 
life, 
liberty, 
property, 
and 
health 
will 
act 
in 
a 
biased 
manner. 
Where, 
however, 
differences 
of 
religion, 
nationality, 
or 
the 
like 
have 
divided 
the 
population 
into 
groups 
separated 
by 
a 
gulf 
so 
deep 
as 
to 
exclude 
every 
impulse 
of 
fairness 
or 
humanity 
and 
to 
leave 
room 
for 
nothing 
but 
hate, 
the 
situation 
is 
quite 
different. 
Then 
the 
judge 
who 
acts 
consciously, 
or 
still 
more 
often 
unconsciously, 
in 
a 
biased 
manner 
thinks 
he 
is 
fulfilling 
a 
higher 
duty 
when 
he 
makes 
use 
of 
the 
prerogatives 
and 
powers 
of 
his 
office 
in 
the 
service 
of 
his 
own 
group. 


To 
the 
extent 
that 
the 
apparatus 
of 
government 
has 
no 
other 
function 
than 
that 
of 
protecting 
life, 
liberty, 
property, 
and 
health, 
it 
is 
possible, 
at 
any 
rate, 
to 
draw 
up 
regulations 
that 
so 
strictly 
circumscribe 
the 
domain 
in 
which 
the 
administrative 
authorities 
and 
the 
courts 
are 
free 
to 
act 
as 
to 
leave 
little 
or 
no 
latitude 
for 
the 
exercise 
of 
their 
own 
discretion 
or 
arbitrary, 
subjective 
judgment. 
But 
once 
a 
share 
in 
the 
management 
of 
production 
is 
relinquished 
to 
the 
state, 
once 
the 
apparatus 
of 
government 
is 
called 
upon 
to 
determine 
the 
disposition 
of 
goods 
of 
higher 
order, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
hold 
administrative 
officials 
to 
a 
set 
of 
binding 
rules 
and 
regulations 
that 
would 
guarantee 
certain 
rights 
to 
every 
citizen. 
A 
penal 
law 
designed 
to 
punish 
murderers 
can, 
to 
some 
extent 
at 
least, 
draw 
a 
dividing 
line 
between 
what 
is 
and 
what 
is 
not 
to 
be 
considered 
murder 
and 
thus 
set 
certain 
limits 
to 
the 
area 
in 
which 
the 
magistrate 
is 
free 
to 
use 
his 
own 
judgment. 
Of 
course, 
every 
lawyer 
knows 
only 
too 
well 
that 
even 
the 
best 
law 
can 
be 
perverted, 
in 
concrete 
cases, 
in 
interpretation, 
application, 
and 
administration. 
But 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
government 
bureau 
charged 
with 
the 
management 
of 
transportation 
facilities, 
mines, 
or 
public 
lands, 
as 
much 
as 
one 
may 
restrain 
its 
freedom 
of 
action 
on 
other 
grounds 
(which 
have 
already 
been 
discussed 
in 
section 
2), 
the 
most 
one 
can 
do 
to 
keep 
it 
impartial 
in 
regard 
to 
controversial 
questions 
of 
national 
policy 
is 
to 
give 
it 
directives 
couched 
in 
empty 
generalities. 
One 
must 
grant 
it 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
leeway 
in 
many 
respects 
because 
one 
cannot 
know 
beforehand 
under 
what 
circumstances 
it 
will 
have 
to 
act. 
Thus, 
the 
door 
is 
left 
wide 
open 
for 
arbitrariness, 
bias, 
and 
the 
abuse 
of 
official 
power. 


Even 
in 
areas 
inhabited 
by 
people 
of 
various 
nationalities, 
there 
is 
need 
for 
a 
unified 
administration. 
One 
cannot 
place 
at 
every 
street-corner 
both 
a 
German 
and 
a 
Czech 
policeman, 
each 
of 
whom 
would 
have 
to 
protect 
only 
members 
of 
his 
own 
nationality. 
And 
even 
if 
this 
could 
be 
done, 
the 
question 
would 
still 
arise 
as 
to 
who 
is 
to 
intervene 
when 
members 
of 
both 
nationalities 



are 
involved 
in 
a 
situation 
that 
calls 
for 
intervention. 
The 
disadvantages 
that 
result 
from 
the 
necessity 
of 
a 
unified 
administration 
in 
these 
territories 
are 
unavoidable. 
But 
if 
difficulties 
already 
exist 
even 
in 
carrying 
out 
such 
indispensable 
functions 
of 
government 
as 
the 
protection 
of 
life, 
liberty, 
property, 
and 
health, 
one 
should 
not 
raise 
them 
to 
really 
monstrous 
proportions 
by 
extending 
the 
range 
of 
state 
activity 
to 
other 
fields 
in 
which, 
by 
their 
very 
nature, 
still 
greater 
latitude 
must 
be 
granted 
to 
arbitrary 
judgment. 


Large 
areas 
of 
the 
world 
have 
been 
settled, 
not 
by 
the 
members 
of 
just 
one 
nationality, 
one 
race, 
or 
one 
religion, 
but 
by 
a 
motley 
mixture 
of 
many 
peoples. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
migratory 
movements 
that 
necessarily 
follow 
shifts 
in 
the 
location 
of 
production, 
more 
new 
territories 
are 
continually 
being 
confronted 
with 
the 
problem 
of 
a 
mixed 
population. 
If 
one 
does 
not 
wish 
to 
aggravate 
artificially 
the 
friction 
that 
must 
arise 
from 
this 
living 
together 
of 
different 
groups, 
one 
must 
restrict 
the 
state 
to 
just 
those 
tasks 
that 
it 
alone 
can 
perform. 


4. 
Nationalism 
As 
long 
as 
nations 
were 
ruled 
by 
monarchical 
despots, 
the 
idea 
of 
adjusting 
the 
boundaries 
of 
the 
state 
to 
coincide 
with 
the 
boundaries 
between 
nationalities 
could 
not 
find 
acceptance. 
If 
a 
potentate 
desired 
to 
incorporate 
a 
province 
into 
his 
realm, 
he 
cared 
little 
whether 
the 
inhabitants—the 
subjects 
—agreed 
to 
a 
change 
of 
rulers 
or 
not. 
The 
only 
consideration 
that 
was 
regarded 
as 
relevant 
was 
whether 
the 
available 
military 
forces 
were 
sufficient 
to 
conquer 
and 
hold 
the 
territory 
in 
question. 
One 
justified 
one’s 
conduct 
publicly 
by 
the 
more 
or 
less 
artificial 
construction 
of 
a 
legal 
claim. 
The 
nationality 
of 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
area 
concerned 
was 
not 
taken 
into 
account 
at 
all. 


It 
was 
with 
the 
rise 
of 
liberalism 
that 
the 
question 
of 
how 
the 
boundaries 
of 
states 
are 
to 
be 
drawn 
first 
became 
a 
problem 
independent 
of 
military, 
historical, 
and 
legal 
considerations. 
Liberalism, 
which 
founds 
the 
state 
on 
the 
will 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
people 
living 
in 
a 
certain 
territory, 
disallows 
all 
military 
considerations 
that 
were 
formerly 
decisive 
in 
defining 
the 
boundaries 
of 
the 
state. 
It 
rejects 
the 
right 
of 
conquest. 
It 
cannot 
understand 
how 
people 
can 
speak 
of 
“strategic 
frontiers” 
and 
finds 
entirely 
incomprehensible 
the 



demand 
that 
a 
piece 
of 
land 
be 
incorporated 
into 
one’s 
own 
state 
in 
order 
to 
possess 
a 
glacis. 
Liberalism 
does 
not 
acknowledge 
the 
historical 
right 
of 
a 
prince 
to 
inherit 
a 
province. 
A 
king 
can 
rule, 
in 
the 
liberal 
sense, 
only 
over 
persons 
and 
not 
over 
a 
certain 
piece 
of 
land, 
of 
which 
the 
inhabitants 
are 
viewed 
as 
mere 
appendages. 
The 
monarch 
by 
the 
grace 
of 
God 
carries 
the 
title 
of 
a 
territory, 
e.g., 
“King 
of 
France.” 
The 
kings 
installed 
by 
liberalism 
received 
their 
title, 
not 
from 
the 
name 
of 
the 
territory, 
but 
from 
that 
of 
the 
people 
over 
whom 
they 
ruled 
as 
constitutional 
monarchs. 
Thus, 
Louis 
Philippe 
bore 
the 
title, 
“King 
of 
the 
French”; 
thus 
too, 
there 
is 
a 
“King 
of 
the 
Belgians,” 
as 
there 
was 
once 
a 
“King 
of 
the 
Hellenes.” 


It 
was 
liberalism 
that 
created 
the 
legal 
form 
by 
which 
the 
desire 
of 
the 
people 
to 
belong 
or 
not 
to 
belong 
to 
a 
certain 
state 
could 
gain 
expression, 
viz., 
the 
plebiscite. 
The 
state 
to 
which 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
a 
certain 
territory 
wish 
to 
belong 
is 
to 
be 
ascertained 
by 
means 
of 
an 
election. 
But 
even 
if 
all 
the 
necessary 
economic 
and 
political 
conditions 
(e.g., 
those 
involving 
the 
national 
policy 
in 
regard 
to 
education) 
were 
fulfilled 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
the 
plebiscite 
from 
being 
reduced 
to 
a 
farce, 
even 
if 
it 
were 
possible 
simply 
to 
take 
a 
poll 
of 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
every 
community 
in 
order 
to 
determine 
to 
which 
state 
they 
wished 
to 
attach 
themselves, 
and 
to 
repeat 
such 
an 
election 
whenever 
circumstances 
changed, 
some 
unresolved 
problems 
would 
certainly 
still 
remain 
as 
possible 
sources 
of 
friction 
between 
the 
different 
nationalities. 
The 
situation 
of 
having 
to 
belong 
to 
a 
state 
to 
which 
one 
does 
not 
wish 
to 
belong 
is 
no 
less 
onerous 
if 
it 
is 
the 
result 
of 
an 
election 
than 
if 
one 
must 
endure 
it 
as 
the 
consequence 
of 
a 
military 
conquest. 
But 
it 
is 
doubly 
difficult 
for 
the 
individual 
who 
is 
cut 
off 
from 
the 
majority 
of 
his 
fellow 
citizens 
by 
a 
language 
barrier. 


To 
be 
a 
member 
of 
a 
national 
minority 
always 
means 
that 
one 
is 
a 
second-class 
citizen. 
Discussions 
of 
political 
questions 
must, 
of 
course, 
be 
carried 
on 
by 
means 
of 
the 
written 
and 
spoken 
word—in 
speeches, 
newspaper 
articles, 
and 
books. 
However, 
these 
means 
of 
political 
enlightenment 
and 
debate 
are 
not 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
the 
linguistic 
minority 
to 
the 
same 
extent 
as 
they 
are 
for 
those 
whose 
mother 
tongue—the 
language 
used 
in 
everyday 
speech—is 
that 
in 
which 
the 
discussions 
take 
place. 
The 
political 
thought 
of 
a 
people, 
after 
all, 
is 
the 
reflection 
of 
the 
ideas 
contained 
in 
its 
political 
literature. 
Cast 
into 
the 
form 
of 
statute 
law, 
the 
outcome 
of 
its 
political 
discussions 
acquires 
direct 
significance 
for 
the 
citizen 
who 
speaks 
a 
foreign 



tongue, 
since 
he 
must 
obey 
the 
law; 
yet 
he 
has 
the 
feeling 
that 
he 
is 
excluded 
from 
effective 
participation 
in 
shaping 
the 
will 
of 
the 
legislative 
authority 
or 
at 
least 
that 
he 
is 
not 
allowed 
to 
cooperate 
in 
shaping 
it 
to 
the 
same 
extent 
as 
those 
whose 
native 
tongue 
is 
that 
of 
the 
ruling 
majority. 
And 
when 
he 
appears 
before 
a 
magistrate 
or 
any 
administrative 
official 
as 
a 
party 
to 
a 
suit 
or 
a 
petition, 
he 
stands 
before 
men 
whose 
political 
thought 
is 
foreign 
to 
him 
because 
it 
developed 
under 
different 
ideological 
influences. 


But 
even 
apart 
from 
all 
this, 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
the 
members 
of 
the 
minority 
are 
required, 
in 
appearing 
before 
tribunals 
and 
administrative 
authorities, 
to 
make 
use 
of 
a 
language 
foreign 
to 
them 
already 
handicaps 
them 
seriously 
in 
many 
respects. 
There 
is 
all 
the 
difference 
in 
the 
world, 
when 
one 
is 
on 
trial, 
between 
being 
able 
to 
speak 
in 
court 
directly 
to 
one’s 
judges 
and 
being 
compelled 
to 
avail 
oneself 
of 
the 
services 
of 
an 
interpreter. 
At 
every 
turn, 
the 
member 
of 
a 
national 
minority 
is 
made 
to 
feel 
that 
he 
lives 
among 
strangers 
and 
that 
he 
is, 
even 
if 
the 
letter 
of 
the 
law 
denies 
it, 
a 
second-class 
citizen. 


All 
these 
disadvantages 
are 
felt 
to 
be 
very 
oppressive 
even 
in 
a 
state 
with 
a 
liberal 
constitution 
in 
which 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
government 
is 
restricted 
to 
the 
protection 
of 
the 
life 
and 
property 
of 
the 
citizens. 
But 
they 
become 
quite 
intolerable 
in 
an 
interventionist 
or 
a 
socialist 
state. 
If 
the 
administrative 
authorities 
have 
the 
right 
to 
intervene 
everywhere 
according 
to 
their 
free 
discretion, 
if 
the 
latitude 
granted 
to 
judges 
and 
officials 
in 
reaching 
their 
decisions 
is 
so 
wide 
as 
to 
leave 
room 
also 
for 
the 
operation 
of 
political 
prejudices, 
then 
a 
member 
of 
a 
national 
minority 
finds 
himself 
delivered 
over 
to 
arbitrary 
judgment 
and 
oppression 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
public 
functionaries 
belonging 
to 
the 
ruling 
majority. 
What 
happens 
when 
school 
and 
church 
as 
well 
are 
not 
independent, 
but 
subject 
to 
regulation 
by 
the 
government, 
has 
already 
been 
discussed. 


It 
is 
here 
that 
one 
must 
seek 
for 
the 
roots 
of 
the 
aggressive 
nationalism 
that 
we 
see 
at 
work 
today. 
Efforts 
to 
trace 
back 
to 
natural 
rather 
than 
political 
causes 
the 
violent 
antagonisms 
existing 
between 
nations 
today 
are 
altogether 
mistaken. 
All 
the 
symptoms 
of 
supposedly 
innate 
antipathy 
between 
peoples 
that 
are 
customarily 
offered 
in 
evidence 
exist 
also 
within 
each 
individual 
nation. 
The 
Bavarian 
hates 
the 
Prussian; 
the 
Prussian, 
the 
Bavarian. 
No 
less 
fierce 
is 
the 
hatred 
existing 
among 
individual 
groups 
within 
both 
France 
and 
Poland. 
Nevertheless, 
Germans, 
Poles, 
and 
Frenchmen 
manage 
to 
live 



peacefully 
within 
their 
own 
countries. 
What 
gives 
the 
antipathy 
of 
the 
Pole 
for 
the 
German 
and 
of 
the 
German 
for 
the 
Pole 
a 
special 
political 
significance 
is 
the 
aspiration 
of 
each 
of 
the 
two 
peoples 
to 
seize 
for 
itself 
political 
control 
of 
the 
border 
areas 
in 
which 
Germans 
and 
Poles 
live 
side 
by 
side 
and 
to 
use 
it 
to 
oppress 
the 
members 
of 
the 
other 
nationality. 
What 
has 
kindled 
the 
hatred 
between 
nations 
to 
a 
consuming 
fire 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
people 
want 
to 
use 
the 
schools 
to 
estrange 
children 
from 
the 
language 
of 
their 
fathers 
and 
to 
make 
use 
of 
the 
courts 
and 
administrative 
offices, 
political 
and 
economic 
measures, 
and 
outright 
expropriation 
to 
persecute 
those 
speaking 
a 
foreign 
tongue. 
Because 
people 
are 
prepared 
to 
resort 
to 
violent 
means 
in 
order 
to 
create 
favorable 
conditions 
for 
the 
political 
future 
of 
their 
own 
nation, 
they 
have 
established 
a 
system 
of 
oppression 
in 
the 
polyglot 
areas 
that 
imperils 
the 
peace 
of 
the 
world. 


As 
long 
as 
the 
liberal 
program 
is 
not 
completely 
carried 
out 
in 
the 
territories 
of 
mixed 
nationality, 
hatred 
between 
members 
of 
different 
nations 
must 
become 
ever 
fiercer 
and 
continue 
to 
ignite 
new 
wars 
and 
rebellions. 


5. 
Imperialism 
The 
lust 
for 
conquest 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
absolute 
monarchs 
of 
previous 
centuries 
was 
aimed 
at 
an 
extension 
of 
their 
sphere 
of 
power 
and 
an 
increase 
in 
their 
wealth. 
No 
prince 
could 
be 
powerful 
enough, 
for 
it 
was 
by 
force 
alone 
that 
he 
could 
preserve 
his 
rule 
against 
internal 
and 
external 
enemies. 
No 
prince 
could 
be 
rich 
enough, 
for 
he 
needed 
money 
for 
the 
maintenance 
of 
his 
soldiers 
and 
the 
upkeep 
of 
his 
entourage. 


For 
a 
liberal 
state, 
the 
question 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
boundaries 
of 
its 
territory 
are 
to 
be 
further 
extended 
is 
of 
minor 
significance. 
Wealth 
cannot 
be 
won 
by 
the 
annexation 
of 
new 
provinces, 
since 
the 
“revenue” 
derived 
from 
a 
territory 
must 
be 
used 
to 
defray 
the 
necessary 
costs 
of 
its 
administration. 
For 
a 
liberal 
state, 
which 
entertains 
no 
aggressive 
plans, 
a 
strengthening 
of 
its 
military 
power 
is 
unimportant. 
Thus, 
liberal 
parliaments 
resisted 
all 
endeavors 
to 
increase 
their 
country’s 
war 
potential 
and 
opposed 
all 
bellicose 
and 
annexationist 
policies. 


But 
the 
liberal 
policy 
of 
peace 
which, 
in 
the 
early 
sixties 
of 
the 
last 
century, 
as 
liberalism 
swept 
from 
one 
victory 
to 
another, 
was 
considered 
as 
already 
assured, 
at 
least 
in 
Europe, 
was 
based 
on 
the 
assumption 
that 
the 



people 
of 
every 
territory 
would 
have 
the 
right 
to 
determine 
for 
themselves 
the 
state 
to 
which 
they 
wished 
to 
belong. 
However, 
in 
order 
to 
secure 
this 
right, 
since 
the 
absolutist 
powers 
had 
no 
intention 
of 
peacefully 
relinquishing 
their 
prerogatives, 
a 
number 
of 
rather 
serious 
wars 
and 
revolutions 
were 
first 
necessary. 
The 
overthrow 
of 
foreign 
domination 
in 
Italy, 
the 
preservation 
of 
the 
Germans 
in 
Schleswig-Holstein 
in 
the 
face 
of 
threatening 
denationalization, 
the 
liberation 
of 
the 
Poles 
and 
of 
the 
South 
Slavs 
could 
be 
attempted 
only 
by 
force 
of 
arms. 
In 
only 
one 
of 
the 
many 
places 
where 
the 
existing 
political 
order 
found 
itself 
opposed 
by 
a 
demand 
for 
the 
right 
of 
self-
determination 
could 
the 
issue 
be 
peacefully 
resolved: 
liberal 
England 
freed 
the 
Ionian 
islands. 
Everywhere 
else 
the 
same 
situation 
resulted 
in 
wars 
and 
revolutions. 
From 
the 
struggles 
to 
form 
a 
unified 
German 
state 
developed 
the 
disastrous 
modern 
Franco-German 
conflict; 
the 
Polish 
question 
remained 
unresolved 
because 
the 
Czar 
crushed 
one 
rebellion 
after 
another; 
the 
Balkan 
question 
was 
only 
partially 
settled; 
and 
the 
impossibility 
of 
solving 
the 
problems 
of 
the 
Hapsburg 
monarchy 
against 
the 
will 
of 
the 
ruling 
dynasty 
ultimately 
led 
to 
the 
incident 
that 
became 
the 
immediate 
cause 
of 
the 
World 
War. 


Modern 
imperialism 
is 
distinguished 
from 
the 
expansionist 
tendencies 
of 
the 
absolute 
principalities 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
its 
moving 
spirits 
are 
not 
the 
members 
of 
the 
ruling 
dynasty, 
nor 
even 
of 
the 
nobility, 
the 
bureaucracy, 
or 
the 
officers’ 
corps 
of 
the 
army 
bent 
on 
personal 
enrichment 
and 
aggrandizement 
by 
plundering 
the 
resources 
of 
conquered 
territories, 
but 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
people, 
who 
look 
upon 
it 
as 
the 
most 
appropriate 
means 
for 
the 
preservation 
of 
national 
independence. 
In 
the 
complex 
network 
of 
antiliberal 
policies, 
which 
have 
so 
far 
expanded 
the 
functions 
of 
the 
state 
as 
to 
leave 
hardly 
any 
field 
of 
human 
activity 
free 
of 
government 
interference, 
it 
is 
futile 
to 
hope 
for 
even 
a 
moderately 
satisfactory 
solution 
of 
the 
political 
problems 
of 
the 
areas 
in 
which 
members 
of 
several 
nationalities 
live 
side 
by 
side. 
If 
the 
government 
of 
these 
territories 
is 
not 
conducted 
along 
completely 
liberal 
lines, 
there 
can 
be 
no 
question 
of 
even 
an 
approach 
to 
equality 
of 
rights 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
the 
various 
national 
groups. 
There 
can 
then 
be 
only 
rulers 
and 
those 
ruled. 
The 
only 
choice 
is 
whether 
one 
will 
be 
hammer 
or 
anvil. 
Thus, 
the 
striving 
for 
as 
strong 
a 
national 
state 
as 
possible—one 
that 
can 
extend 
its 
control 
to 
all 
territories 
of 
mixed 
nationality—becomes 
an 
indispensable 
requirement 
of 
national 
self-preservation. 



But 
the 
problem 
of 
linguistically 
mixed 
areas 
is 
not 
limited 
to 
countries 
long 
settled. 
Capitalism 
opens 
up 
for 
civilization 
new 
lands 
offering 
more 
favorable 
conditions 
of 
production 
than 
great 
parts 
of 
the 
countries 
that 
have 
been 
long 
inhabited. 
Capital 
and 
labor 
flow 
to 
the 
most 
favorable 
location. 
The 
migratory 
movement 
thus 
initiated 
exceeds 
by 
far 
all 
the 
previous 
migrations 
of 
the 
peoples 
of 
the 
world. 
Only 
a 
few 
nations 
can 
have 
their 
emigrants 
move 
to 
lands 
in 
which 
political 
power 
is 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
their 
compatriots. 
Where, 
however, 
this 
condition 
does 
not 
prevail, 
the 
migration 
gives 
rise 
once 
again 
to 
all 
those 
conflicts 
that 
generally 
develop 
in 
polyglot 
territories. 
In 
particular 
cases, 
into 
which 
we 
shall 
not 
enter 
here, 
matters 
are 
somewhat 
different 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
overseas 
colonization 
than 
in 
the 
long-
settled 
countries 
of 
Europe. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
conflicts 
that 
spring 
from 
the 
unsatisfactory 
situation 
of 
national 
minorities 
are, 
in 
the 
last 
analysis, 
identical. 
The 
desire 
of 
each 
country 
to 
preserve 
its 
own 
nationals 
from 
such 
a 
fate 
leads, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
to 
the 
struggle 
for 
the 
acquisition 
of 
colonies 
suitable 
for 
settlement 
by 
Europeans, 
and, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
to 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
policy 
of 
using 
import 
duties 
to 
protect 
domestic 
production 
operating 
under 
less 
favorable 
conditions 
against 
the 
superior 
competition 
of 
foreign 
industry, 
in 
the 
hope 
of 
thereby 
making 
the 
emigration 
of 
workers 
unnecessary. 
Indeed, 
in 
order 
to 
expand 
the 
protected 
market 
as 
far 
as 
possible, 
efforts 
are 
made 
to 
acquire 
even 
territories 
that 
are 
not 
regarded 
as 
suitable 
for 
European 
settlement. 
We 
may 
date 
the 
beginning 
of 
modern 
imperialism 
from 
the 
late 
seventies 
of 
the 
last 
century, 
when 
the 
industrial 
countries 
of 
Europe 
started 
to 
abandon 
the 
policy 
of 
free 
trade 
and 
to 
engage 
in 
the 
race 
for 
colonial 
“markets” 
in 
Africa 
and 
Asia. 


It 
was 
in 
reference 
to 
England 
that 
the 
term 
“imperialism” 
was 
first 
employed 
to 
characterize 
the 
modern 
policy 
of 
territorial 
expansion. 
England’s 
imperialism, 
to 
be 
sure, 
was 
primarily 
directed, 
not 
so 
much 
toward 
the 
incorporation 
of 
new 
territories 
as 
toward 
the 
creation 
of 
an 
area 
of 
uniform 
commercial 
policy 
out 
of 
the 
various 
possessions 
subject 
to 
the 
King 
of 
England. 
This 
was 
the 
result 
of 
the 
peculiar 
situation 
in 
which 
England 
found 
itself 
as 
the 
mother 
country 
of 
the 
most 
extensive 
colonial 
settlements 
in 
the 
world. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
end 
that 
the 
English 
imperialists 
sought 
to 
attain 
in 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
customs 
union 
embracing 
the 
dominions 
and 
the 
mother 
country 
was 
the 
same 
as 
that 
which 
the 
colonial 
acquisitions 
of 
Germany, 
Italy, 
France, 
Belgium, 
and 
other 
European 
countries 
were 



intended 
to 
serve, 
viz., 
the 
creation 
of 
protected 
export 
markets. 


The 
grand 
commercial 
objectives 
aimed 
at 
by 
the 
policy 
of 
imperialism 
were 
nowhere 
attained. 
The 
dream 
of 
an 
all-British 
customs 
union 
remained 
unrealized. 
The 
territories 
annexed 
by 
European 
countries 
in 
the 
last 
decades, 
as 
well 
as 
those 
in 
which 
they 
were 
able 
to 
obtain 
“concessions,” 
play 
such 
a 
subordinate 
role 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
raw 
materials 
and 
half-manufactured 
goods 
for 
the 
world 
market 
and 
in 
their 
corresponding 
consumption 
of 
industrial 
products 
that 
no 
essential 
change 
in 
conditions 
could 
be 
brought 
about 
by 
such 
arrangements. 
In 
order 
to 
attain 
the 
goals 
that 
imperialism 
aimed 
at, 
it 
was 
not 
enough 
for 
the 
nations 
of 
Europe 
to 
occupy 
areas 
inhabited 
by 
savages 
incapable 
of 
resistance. 
They 
had 
to 
reach 
out 
for 
territories 
that 
were 
in 
the 
possession 
of 
peoples 
ready 
and 
able 
to 
defend 
themselves. 
And 
it 
is 
here 
that 
the 
policy 
of 
imperialism 
suffered 
shipwreck, 
or 
will 
soon 
do 
so. 
In 
Abyssinia, 
in 
Mexico, 
in 
the 
Caucasus, 
in 
Persia, 
in 
China—everywhere 
we 
see 
the 
imperialist 
aggressors 
in 
retreat 
or 
at 
least 
already 
in 
great 
difficulties. 


6. 
Colonial 
Policy 
The 
considerations 
and 
objectives 
that 
have 
guided 
the 
colonial 
policy 
of 
the 
European 
powers 
since 
the 
age 
of 
the 
great 
discoveries 
stand 
in 
the 
sharpest 
contrast 
to 
all 
the 
principles 
of 
liberalism. 
The 
basic 
idea 
of 
colonial 
policy 
was 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
military 
superiority 
of 
the 
white 
race 
over 
the 
members 
of 
other 
races. 
The 
Europeans 
set 
out, 
equipped 
with 
all 
the 
weapons 
and 
contrivances 
that 
their 
civilization 
placed 
at 
their 
disposal, 
to 
subjugate 
weaker 
peoples, 
to 
rob 
them 
of 
their 
property, 
and 
to 
enslave 
them. 
Attempts 
have 
been 
made 
to 
extenuate 
and 
gloss 
over 
the 
true 
motive 
of 
colonial 
policy 
with 
the 
excuse 
that 
its 
sole 
object 
was 
to 
make 
it 
possible 
for 
primitive 
peoples 
to 
share 
in 
the 
blessings 
of 
European 
civilization. 
Even 
assuming 
that 
this 
was 
the 
real 
objective 
of 
the 
governments 
that 
sent 
out 
conquerors 
to 
distant 
parts 
of 
the 
world, 
the 
liberal 
could 
still 
not 
see 
any 
adequate 
basis 
for 
regarding 
this 
kind 
of 
colonization 
as 
useful 
or 
beneficial. 
If, 
as 
we 
believe, 
European 
civilization 
really 
is 
superior 
to 
that 
of 
the 
primitive 
tribes 
of 
Africa 
or 
to 
the 
civilizations 
of 
Asia—estimable 
though 
the 
latter 
may 
be 
in 
their 
own 
way—it 
should 
be 
able 
to 
prove 
its 
superiority 
by 
inspiring 
these 
peoples 
to 
adopt 
it 
of 
their 
own 
accord. 
Could 
there 
be 
a 



more 
doleful 
proof 
of 
the 
sterility 
of 
European 
civilization 
than 
that 
it 
can 
be 
spread 
by 
no 
other 
means 
than 
fire 
and 
sword? 


No 
chapter 
of 
history 
is 
steeped 
further 
in 
blood 
than 
the 
history 
of 
colonialism. 
Blood 
was 
shed 
uselessly 
and 
senselessly. 
Flourishing 
lands 
were 
laid 
waste; 
whole 
peoples 
destroyed 
and 
exterminated. 
All 
this 
can 
in 
no 
way 
be 
extenuated 
or 
justified. 
The 
dominion 
of 
Europeans 
in 
Africa 
and 
in 
important 
parts 
of 
Asia 
is 
absolute. 
It 
stands 
in 
the 
sharpest 
contrast 
to 
all 
the 
principles 
of 
liberalism 
and 
democracy, 
and 
there 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
that 
we 
must 
strive 
for 
its 
abolition. 
The 
only 
question 
is 
how 
the 
elimination 
of 
this 
intolerable 
condition 
can 
be 
accomplished 
in 
the 
least 
harmful 
way 
possible. 


The 
most 
simple 
and 
radical 
solution 
would 
be 
for 
the 
European 
governments 
to 
withdraw 
their 
officials, 
soldiers, 
and 
police 
from 
these 
areas 
and 
to 
leave 
the 
inhabitants 
to 
themselves. 
It 
is 
of 
no 
consequence 
whether 
this 
is 
done 
immediately 
or 
whether 
a 
freely 
held 
plebiscite 
of 
the 
natives 
is 
made 
to 
precede 
the 
surrender 
of 
the 
colonies. 
For 
there 
can 
scarcely 
be 
any 
doubt 
as 
to 
the 
outcome 
of 
a 
truly 
free 
election. 
European 
rule 
in 
the 
overseas 
colonies 
cannot 
count 
on 
the 
consent 
of 
its 
subjects. 


The 
immediate 
consequence 
of 
this 
radical 
solution 
would 
be, 
if 
not 
outright 
anarchy, 
then 
at 
least 
continual 
conflicts 
in 
the 
areas 
evacuated 
by 
the 
Europeans. 
It 
may 
be 
safely 
taken 
for 
granted 
that 
up 
to 
now 
the 
natives 
have 
learned 
only 
evil 
ways 
from 
the 
Europeans, 
and 
not 
good 
ones. 
This 
is 
not 
the 
fault 
of 
the 
natives, 
but 
rather 
of 
their 
European 
conquerors, 
who 
have 
taught 
them 
nothing 
but 
evil. 
They 
have 
brought 
arms 
and 
engines 
of 
destruction 
of 
all 
kinds 
to 
the 
colonies; 
they 
have 
sent 
out 
their 
worst 
and 
most 
brutal 
individuals 
as 
officials 
and 
officers; 
at 
the 
point 
of 
the 
sword 
they 
have 
set 
up 
a 
colonial 
rule 
that 
in 
its 
sanguinary 
cruelty 
rivals 
the 
despotic 
system 
of 
the 
Bolsheviks. 
Europeans 
must 
not 
be 
surprised 
if 
the 
bad 
example 
that 
they 
themselves 
have 
set 
in 
their 
colonies 
now 
bears 
evil 
fruit. 
In 
any 
case, 
they 
have 
no 
right 
to 
complain 
pharisaically 
about 
the 
low 
state 
of 
public 
morals 
among 
the 
natives. 
Nor 
would 
they 
be 
justified 
in 
maintaining 
that 
the 
natives 
are 
not 
yet 
mature 
enough 
for 
freedom 
and 
that 
they 
still 
need 
at 
least 
several 
years 
of 
further 
education 
under 
the 
lash 
of 
foreign 
rulers 
before 
they 
are 
capable 
of 
being 
left 
on 
their 
own. 
For 
this 
“education” 
itself 
is 
at 
least 
partly 
responsible 
for 
the 
terrible 
conditions 
that 
exist 
today 
in 
the 
colonies, 
even 
though 
its 
consequences 
will 
not 
make 
themselves 
fully 
apparent 
until 
after 
the 
eventual 
withdrawal 
of 
European 



troops 
and 
officials. 


But 
perhaps 
it 
will 
be 
contended 
that 
it 
is 
the 
duty 
of 
the 
Europeans, 
as 
members 
of 
a 
superior 
race, 
to 
avoid 
the 
anarchy 
that 
would 
presumably 
break 
out 
after 
the 
evacuation 
of 
the 
colonies 
and 
therefore 
to 
maintain 
their 
dominion 
in 
the 
interests 
and 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
natives 
themselves. 
In 
order 
to 
strengthen 
this 
argument, 
a 
lurid 
picture 
may 
be 
painted 
of 
the 
conditions 
that 
existed 
in 
Central 
Africa 
and 
in 
many 
parts 
of 
Asia 
before 
the 
establishment 
of 
European 
rule. 
One 
may 
recall 
the 
hunts 
for 
slaves 
conducted 
by 
the 
Arabs 
in 
Central 
Africa 
and 
the 
wanton 
outrages 
that 
many 
Indian 
despots 
allowed 
themselves. 
Of 
course, 
there 
is 
much 
that 
is 
hypocritical 
in 
this 
mode 
of 
argumentation, 
and 
one 
should 
not 
forget, 
for 
example, 
that 
the 
slave 
trade 
in 
Africa 
could 
prosper 
only 
because 
the 
descendants 
of 
Europeans 
in 
the 
American 
colonies 
entered 
the 
slave 
market 
as 
buyers. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
necessary 
for 
us 
to 
go 
into 
the 
pros 
and 
cons 
of 
this 
line 
of 
reasoning. 
If 
all 
that 
can 
be 
adduced 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
maintenance 
of 
European 
rule 
in 
the 
colonies 
is 
the 
supposed 
interest 
of 
the 
natives, 
then 
one 
must 
say 
that 
it 
would 
be 
better 
if 
this 
rule 
were 
brought 
to 
an 
end 
completely. 
No 
one 
has 
a 
right 
to 
thrust 
himself 
into 
the 
affairs 
of 
others 
in 
order 
to 
further 
their 
interest, 
and 
no 
one 
ought, 
when 
he 
has 
his 
own 
interests 
in 
view, 
to 
pretend 
that 
he 
is 
acting 
selflessly 
only 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
others. 


There 
is, 
however, 
yet 
another 
argument 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
continuance 
of 
European 
authority 
and 
influence 
in 
the 
colonial 
areas. 
If 
the 
Europeans 
had 
never 
brought 
the 
tropical 
colonies 
under 
their 
dominion, 
if 
they 
had 
not 
made 
their 
economic 
system 
dependent 
to 
a 
considerable 
extent 
on 
the 
importation 
of 
tropical 
raw 
materials 
and 
overseas 
agricultural 
products 
that 
they 
paid 
for 
with 
industrial 
goods, 
it 
would 
still 
be 
possible 
to 
discuss 
quite 
calmly 
the 
question 
whether 
or 
not 
it 
is 
advisable 
to 
draw 
these 
areas 
into 
the 
network 
of 
the 
world 
market. 
But 
since 
colonization 
has 
already 
forced 
all 
these 
territories 
into 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
world-wide 
economic 
community, 
the 
situation 
is 
quite 
different. 
The 
economy 
of 
Europe 
today 
is 
based, 
to 
a 
great 
extent, 
on 
the 
inclusion 
of 
Africa 
and 
large 
parts 
of 
Asia 
in 
the 
world 
economy 
as 
suppliers 
of 
raw 
materials 
of 
all 
kinds. 
These 
raw 
materials 
are 
not 
taken 
from 
the 
natives 
of 
these 
areas 
by 
force. 
They 
are 
not 
carried 
away 
as 
tribute, 
but 
handed 
over 
in 
voluntary 
exchange 
for 
the 
industrial 
products 
of 
Europe. 
Thus, 
relations 
are 
not 
founded 
on 
any 
one-sided 
advantage; 
they 



are, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
mutually 
beneficial, 
and 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
colonies 
derive 
from 
them 
just 
as 
many 
advantages 
as 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
England 
or 
Switzerland. 
Any 
stoppage 
in 
these 
trade 
relations 
would 
involve 
serious 
economic 
losses 
for 
Europe 
as 
well 
as 
for 
the 
colonies 
and 
would 
sharply 
depress 
the 
standard 
of 
living 
of 
great 
masses 
of 
people. 
If 
the 
slow 
extension 
of 
economic 
relations 
over 
the 
whole 
earth 
and 
the 
gradual 
development 
of 
the 
world 
economy 
was 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
sources 
of 
the 
increasing 
wealth 
of 
the 
last 
hundred 
and 
fifty 
years, 
a 
reversal 
of 
this 
trend 
would 
represent 
for 
the 
world 
an 
economic 
catastrophe 
of 
hitherto 
unprecedented 
proportions. 
In 
its 
extent 
and 
consequences, 
this 
catastrophe 
would 
exceed 
by 
far 
the 
crisis 
connected 
with 
the 
economic 
consequences 
of 
the 
World 
War. 
Ought 
the 
well-being 
of 
Europe 
and, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
that 
of 
the 
colonies 
as 
well 
to 
be 
allowed 
to 
decline 
further 
in 
order 
to 
give 
the 
natives 
a 
chance 
to 
determine 
their 
own 
political 
destinies, 
when 
this 
would 
lead, 
in 
any 
event, 
not 
to 
their 
freedom, 
but 
merely 
to 
a 
change 
of 
masters? 


This 
is 
the 
consideration 
that 
must 
be 
decisive 
in 
judging 
questions 
of 
colonial 
policy. 
European 
officials, 
troops, 
and 
police 
must 
remain 
in 
these 
areas, 
as 
far 
as 
their 
presence 
is 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
maintain 
the 
legal 
and 
political 
conditions 
required 
to 
insure 
the 
participation 
of 
the 
colonial 
territories 
in 
international 
trade. 
It 
must 
be 
possible 
to 
carry 
on 
commercial, 
industrial, 
and 
agricultural 
operations 
in 
the 
colonies, 
to 
exploit 
mines, 
and 
to 
bring 
the 
products 
of 
the 
country, 
by 
rail 
and 
river, 
to 
the 
coast 
and 
thence 
to 
Europe 
and 
America. 
That 
all 
this 
should 
continue 
to 
be 
possible 
is 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
everyone, 
not 
only 
of 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
Europe, 
America, 
and 
Australia, 
but 
also 
of 
the 
natives 
of 
Asia 
and 
Africa 
themselves. 
Wherever 
the 
colonial 
powers 
do 
not 
go 
beyond 
this 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
their 
colonies, 
one 
can 
raise 
no 
objection 
to 
their 
activities 
even 
from 
the 
liberal 
standpoint. 


But 
everyone 
knows 
how 
seriously 
all 
the 
colonial 
powers 
have 
sinned 
against 
this 
principle. 
It 
is 
hardly 
necessary 
to 
recall 
the 
horrors 
that 
trustworthy 
English 
correspondents 
have 
reported 
as 
having 
been 
perpetrated 
in 
the 
Belgian 
Congo. 
Let 
us 
assume 
that 
these 
atrocities 
were 
not 
intended 
by 
the 
Belgian 
government 
and 
are 
only 
to 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
excesses 
and 
evil 
characters 
of 
the 
functionaries 
sent 
out 
to 
the 
Congo. 
Yet 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
almost 
all 
the 
colonial 
powers 
have 
established 
in 
their 
overseas 
possessions 
a 
commercial 
system 
that 
grants 
a 
favored 
position 
to 
the 
goods 
of 
the 
mother 
country 
shows 
that 
present-day 
colonial 
policy 
is 
dominated 
by 



considerations 
altogether 
different 
from 
those 
that 
ought 
to 
prevail 
in 
this 
field. 


In 
order 
to 
bring 
the 
interests 
of 
Europe 
and 
of 
the 
white 
race 
into 
harmony 
with 
those 
of 
the 
colored 
races 
in 
the 
colonies 
in 
regard 
to 
all 
questions 
of 
economic 
policy, 
the 
League 
of 
Nations 
must 
be 
given 
supreme 
authority 
in 
the 
administration 
of 
all 
those 
overseas 
territories 
in 
which 
there 
is 
no 
system 
of 
parliamentary 
government. 
The 
League 
would 
have 
to 
see 
to 
it 
that 
self-government 
is 
granted 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
to 
the 
lands 
that 
today 
do 
not 
yet 
possess 
it 
and 
that 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
mother 
country 
is 
limited 
to 
the 
protection 
of 
property, 
of 
the 
civil 
rights 
of 
foreigners, 
and 
of 
trade 
relations. 
The 
natives 
as 
well 
as 
the 
nationals 
of 
other 
powers 
must 
be 
granted 
the 
right 
to 
bring 
complaints 
directly 
to 
the 
League 
if 
any 
measures 
of 
the 
mother 
country 
exceed 
what 
is 
required 
to 
guarantee 
the 
security 
of 
trade 
and 
commerce 
and 
of 
economic 
activity 
in 
general 
in 
these 
territories, 
and 
the 
League 
of 
Nations 
must 
be 
granted 
the 
right 
to 
make 
an 
effective 
settlement 
of 
such 
complaints. 


The 
application 
of 
these 
principles 
would 
mean, 
in 
effect, 
that 
all 
the 
overseas 
territories 
of 
the 
European 
countries 
would 
at 
first 
be 
turned 
into 
mandates 
of 
the 
League. 
But 
even 
this 
would 
have 
to 
be 
viewed 
only 
as 
a 
transitional 
stage. 
The 
final 
goal 
must 
continue 
to 
be 
the 
complete 
liberation 
of 
the 
colonies 
from 
the 
despotic 
rule 
under 
which 
they 
live 
today. 


With 
this 
solution 
to 
a 
difficult 
problem—which 
is 
becoming 
ever 
more 
difficult 
with 
the 
passage 
of 
time—not 
only 
the 
nations 
of 
Europe 
and 
America 
that 
do 
not 
possess 
colonies, 
but 
also 
the 
colonial 
powers 
and 
the 
natives 
would 
have 
to 
be 
content. 
The 
colonial 
powers 
have 
to 
realize 
that 
in 
the 
long 
run 
they 
will 
not 
be 
able 
to 
maintain 
their 
dominion 
over 
the 
colonies. 
As 
capitalism 
has 
penetrated 
into 
these 
territories, 
the 
natives 
have 
become 
self-reliant; 
there 
is 
no 
longer 
any 
cultural 
disparity 
between 
their 
upper 
classes 
and 
the 
officers 
and 
officials 
who 
are 
in 
charge 
of 
the 
administration 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
mother 
country. 
Militarily 
and 
politically, 
the 
distribution 
of 
power 
today 
is 
quite 
different 
from 
what 
it 
was 
even 
a 
generation 
ago. 
The 
attempt 
of 
the 
European 
powers, 
the 
United 
States, 
and 
Japan 
to 
treat 
China 
as 
a 
colonial 
territory 
has 
proved 
a 
failure. 
In 
Egypt, 
the 
English 
are 
even 
now 
in 
retreat; 
in 
India, 
they 
are 
already 
in 
a 
defensive 
position. 
That 
the 
Netherlands 
would 
be 
unable 
to 
hold 
the 
East 
Indies 
against 
a 
really 
serious 
attack 
is 
well 
known. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
the 
French 



colonies 
in 
Africa 
and 
Asia. 
The 
Americans 
are 
not 
happy 
with 
the 
Philippines 
and 
would 
be 
prepared 
to 
give 
them 
up 
if 
a 
suitable 
occasion 
presented 
itself. 
The 
transfer 
of 
the 
colonies 
to 
the 
care 
of 
the 
League 
of 
Nations 
would 
guarantee 
to 
the 
colonial 
powers 
the 
undiminished 
possession 
of 
their 
capital 
investments 
and 
protect 
them 
against 
having 
to 
make 
sacrifices 
to 
quell 
native 
uprisings. 
The 
natives 
too 
could 
only 
be 
grateful 
for 
a 
proposal 
that 
would 
assure 
them 
independence 
by 
way 
of 
a 
peaceful 
evolution 
and 
with 
it 
the 
guarantee 
that 
no 
neighbor 
bent 
on 
conquest 
would 
threaten 
their 
political 
independence 
in 
the 
future. 


7. 
Free 
Trade 
The 
theoretical 
demonstration 
of 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
protective 
tariff 
and 
of 
free 
trade 
is 
the 
keystone 
of 
classical 
economics. 
It 
is 
so 
clear, 
so 
obvious, 
so 
indisputable, 
that 
its 
opponents 
were 
unable 
to 
advance 
any 
arguments 
against 
it 
that 
could 
not 
be 
immediately 
refuted 
as 
completely 
mistaken 
and 
absurd. 


Nevertheless, 
nowadays 
we 
find 
protective 
tariffs—indeed, 
often 
even 
outright 
prohibitions 
on 
imports—all 
over 
the 
world. 
Even 
in 
England, 
the 
mother 
country 
of 
free 
trade, 
protectionism 
is 
in 
the 
ascendancy 
today. 
The 
principle 
of 
national 
autarky 
wins 
new 
supporters 
with 
every 
day 
that 
passes. 
Even 
countries 
with 
only 
a 
few 
million 
inhabitants, 
like 
Hungary 
and 
Czechoslovakia, 
are 
attempting, 
by 
means 
of 
a 
high-tariff 
policy 
and 
prohibitions 
on 
imports, 
to 
make 
themselves 
independent 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
world. 
The 
basic 
idea 
of 
the 
foreign 
trade 
policy 
of 
the 
United 
States 
is 
to 
impose 
on 
all 
goods 
produced 
abroad 
at 
lower 
costs 
import 
duties 
to 
the 
full 
amount 
of 
this 
difference. 
What 
renders 
the 
whole 
situation 
grotesque 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
all 
countries 
want 
to 
decrease 
their 
imports, 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
to 
increase 
their 
exports. 
The 
effect 
of 
these 
policies 
is 
to 
interfere 
with 
the 
international 
division 
of 
labor 
and 
thereby 
generally 
to 
lower 
the 
productivity 
of 
labor. 
The 
only 
reason 
this 
result 
has 
not 
become 
more 
noticeable 
is 
that 
the 
advances 
of 
the 
capitalist 
system 
have 
always 
been 
so 
far 
sufficient 
to 
outweigh 
it. 
However, 
there 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
that 
everyone 
today 
would 
be 
richer 
if 
the 
protective 
tariff 
did 
not 
artificially 
drive 
production 
from 
more 
favorable 
to 
less 
favorable 
localities. 


Under 
a 
system 
of 
completely 
free 
trade, 
capital 
and 
labor 
would 
be 



employed 
wherever 
conditions 
are 
most 
favorable 
for 
production. 
Other 
locations 
would 
be 
used 
as 
long 
as 
it 
was 
still 
possible 
to 
produce 
anywhere 
under 
more 
favorable 
conditions. 
To 
the 
extent 
to 
which, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
development 
of 
the 
means 
of 
transportation, 
improvements 
in 
technology, 
and 
more 
thorough 
exploration 
of 
countries 
newly 
opened 
to 
commerce, 
it 
is 
discovered 
that 
there 
are 
sites 
more 
favorable 
for 
production 
than 
those 
currently 
being 
used, 
production 
shifts 
to 
these 
localities. 
Capital 
and 
labor 
tend 
to 
move 
from 
areas 
where 
conditions 
are 
less 
favorable 
for 
production 
to 
those 
in 
which 
they 
are 
more 
favorable. 


But 
the 
migration 
of 
capital 
and 
labor 
presupposes 
not 
only 
complete 
freedom 
of 
trade, 
but 
also 
the 
complete 
absence 
of 
obstacles 
to 
their 
movement 
from 
one 
country 
to 
another. 
This 
was 
far 
from 
being 
the 
case 
at 
the 
time 
that 
the 
classical 
free-trade 
doctrine 
was 
first 
developed. 
A 
whole 
series 
of 
obstacles 
stood 
in 
the 
way 
of 
the 
free 
movement 
of 
both 
capital 
and 
labor. 
Because 
of 
ignorance 
of 
conditions, 
a 
general 
insecurity 
in 
regard 
to 
law 
and 
order, 
and 
a 
number 
of 
similar 
reasons, 
capitalists 
felt 
reluctant 
about 
investing 
in 
foreign 
countries. 
As 
for 
the 
workers, 
they 
found 
it 
impossible 
to 
leave 
their 
native 
land, 
not 
only 
because 
of 
their 
ignorance 
of 
foreign 
languages, 
but 
because 
of 
legal, 
religious, 
and 
other 
difficulties. 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
it 
was, 
to 
be 
sure, 
generally 
true 
that 
capital 
and 
labor 
could 
move 
freely 
within 
each 
country, 
but 
obstacles 
stood 
in 
the 
way 
of 
their 
movement 
from 
one 
country 
to 
another. 
The 
sole 
justification 
for 
distinguishing 
in 
economic 
theory 
between 
domestic 
and 
foreign 
trade 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
former 
there 
is 
free 
mobility 
of 
capital 
and 
labor, 
whereas 
this 
is 
not 
true 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
commerce 
between 
nations. 
Thus, 
the 
problem 
that 
the 
classical 
theory 
had 
to 
solve 
may 
be 
stated 
as 
follows: 
What 
are 
the 
effects 
of 
free 
trade 
in 
consumers’ 
goods 
between 
one 
country 
and 
another 
if 
the 
mobility 
of 
capital 
and 
labor 
from 
one 
to 
the 
other 
is 
restricted? 


To 
this 
question 
Ricardo’s 
doctrine 
provided 
the 
answer. 
The 
branches 
of 
production 
distribute 
themselves 
among 
the 
individual 
countries 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
each 
country 
devotes 
its 
resources 
to 
those 
industries 
in 
which 
it 
possesses 
the 
greatest 
superiority 
over 
other 
countries. 
The 
mercantilists 
had 
feared 
that 
a 
country 
with 
unfavorable 
conditions 
for 
production 
would 
import 
more 
than 
it 
would 
export, 
so 
that 
it 
would 
ultimately 
find 
itself 
without 
any 
money; 
and 
they 
demanded 
that 
protective 
tariffs 
and 



prohibitions 
on 
imports 
be 
decreed 
in 
time 
to 
prevent 
such 
a 
deplorable 
situation 
from 
arising. 
The 
classical 
doctrine 
shows 
that 
these 
mercantilist 
fears 
were 
groundless. 
For 
even 
a 
country 
in 
which 
the 
conditions 
of 
production 
in 
every 
branch 
of 
industry 
are 
less 
favorable 
than 
they 
are 
in 
other 
countries 
need 
not 
fear 
that 
it 
will 
export 
less 
than 
it 
will 
import. 
The 
classical 
doctrine 
demonstrated, 
in 
a 
brilliant 
and 
incontrovertible 
way 
that 
has 
never 
been 
contested 
by 
anybody, 
that 
even 
countries 
with 
relatively 
favorable 
conditions 
of 
production 
must 
find 
it 
advantageous 
to 
import 
from 
countries 
with 
comparatively 
unfavorable 
conditions 
of 
production 
those 
commodities 
that 
they 
would, 
to 
be 
sure, 
be 
better 
fitted 
to 
produce, 
but 
not 
so 
much 
better 
fitted 
as 
they 
are 
to 
produce 
other 
commodities 
in 
whose 
production 
they 
then 
specialize. 


Thus, 
what 
the 
classical 
theory 
of 
free 
trade 
says 
to 
the 
statesman 
is: 
There 
are 
countries 
with 
relatively 
favorable 
and 
others 
with 
relatively 
unfavorable 
natural 
conditions 
of 
production. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
interference 
on 
the 
part 
of 
governments, 
the 
international 
division 
of 
labor 
will, 
of 
itself, 
result 
in 
every 
country’s 
finding 
its 
place 
in 
the 
world 
economy, 
no 
matter 
how 
its 
conditions 
of 
production 
compare 
with 
those 
of 
other 
countries. 
Of 
course, 
the 
countries 
with 
comparatively 
favorable 
conditions 
of 
production 
will 
be 
richer 
than 
the 
others, 
but 
this 
is 
a 
fact 
that 
cannot 
be 
altered 
by 
political 
measures 
in 
any 
case. 
It 
is 
simply 
the 
consequence 
of 
a 
difference 
in 
the 
natural 
factors 
of 
production. 


This 
was 
the 
situation 
that 
confronted 
the 
older 
liberalism, 
and 
to 
this 
situation 
it 
responded 
with 
the 
classical 
doctrine 
of 
free 
trade. 
But 
since 
the 
days 
of 
Ricardo 
world 
conditions 
have 
changed 
considerably, 
and 
the 
problem 
that 
the 
free-trade 
doctrine 
had 
to 
face 
in 
the 
last 
sixty 
years 
before 
the 
outbreak 
of 
the 
World 
War 
was 
completely 
different 
from 
the 
one 
with 
which 
it 
had 
to 
deal 
at 
the 
close 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
and 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century. 
For 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
partially 
eliminated 
the 
obstacles 
that, 
at 
its 
beginning, 
had 
stood 
in 
the 
way 
of 
the 
free 
mobility 
of 
capital 
and 
labor. 
In 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
it 
was 
far 
easier 
for 
a 
capitalist 
to 
invest 
his 
capital 
abroad 
than 
it 
had 
been 
in 
Ricardo’s 
day. 
Law 
and 
order 
were 
established 
on 
a 
considerably 
firmer 
foundation; 
knowledge 
of 
foreign 
countries, 
manners, 
and 
customs 
had 
spread; 
and 
the 
joint-stock 
company 
offered 
the 
possibility 
of 
dividing 
the 
risk 
of 
foreign 
enterprises 
among 
many 
persons 
and 
thereby 
reducing 
it. 
It 
would, 
of 
course, 



be 
an 
exaggeration 
to 
say 
that 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century 
capital 
was 
as 
mobile 
in 
its 
passage 
from 
one 
country 
to 
another 
as 
it 
was 
within 
the 
territory 
of 
the 
country 
itself. 
Certain 
differences 
still 
existed, 
to 
be 
sure; 
yet 
the 
assumption 
that 
capital 
had 
to 
remain 
within 
the 
boundaries 
of 
each 
country 
was 
no 
longer 
valid. 
Nor 
was 
this 
any 
longer 
true 
of 
labor 
either. 
In 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
millions 
left 
Europe 
to 
find 
better 
opportunities 
for 
employment 
overseas. 


In 
so 
far 
as 
the 
conditions 
presupposed 
by 
the 
classical 
doctrine 
of 
free 
trade, 
viz., 
the 
immobility 
of 
capital 
and 
labor, 
no 
longer 
existed, 
the 
distinction 
between 
the 
effects 
of 
free 
trade 
in 
domestic 
commerce 
and 
in 
foreign 
commerce 
likewise 
necessarily 
lost 
its 
validity. 
If 
capital 
and 
labor 
can 
move 
as 
freely 
between 
one 
country 
and 
another 
as 
they 
do 
within 
the 
confines 
of 
each, 
then 
there 
is 
no 
further 
justification 
for 
making 
a 
distinction 
between 
the 
effects 
of 
free 
trade 
in 
domestic 
commerce 
and 
in 
foreign 
commerce. 
For 
then 
what 
was 
said 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
former 
holds 
for 
the 
latter 
as 
well: 
the 
result 
of 
free 
trade 
is 
that 
only 
those 
locations 
are 
used 
for 
production 
in 
which 
the 
conditions 
for 
it 
are 
comparatively 
favorable, 
while 
those 
in 
which 
the 
conditions 
of 
production 
are 
comparatively 
unfavorable 
remain 
unused. 
Capital 
and 
labor 
flow 
from 
the 
countries 
with 
less 
favorable 
conditions 
of 
production 
toward 
those 
where 
the 
conditions 
of 
production 
are 
more 
favorable, 
or, 
more 
precisely, 
from 
the 
long-settled, 
thickly 
populated 
European 
countries 
toward 
America 
and 
Australia, 
as 
areas 
that 
offer 
more 
favorable 
conditions 
of 
production. 


For 
the 
European 
nations 
that 
had 
at 
their 
disposal, 
besides 
the 
old 
areas 
of 
settlement 
in 
Europe, 
overseas 
territories 
suitable 
for 
colonization 
by 
Europeans, 
this 
meant 
nothing 
more 
than 
that 
they 
now 
settled 
a 
part 
of 
their 
population 
overseas. 
In 
England’s 
case, 
for 
example, 
some 
of 
her 
sons 
now 
lived 
in 
Canada, 
Australia, 
or 
South 
Africa. 
The 
emigrants 
who 
had 
left 
England 
could 
retain 
their 
English 
citizenship 
and 
nationality 
in 
their 
new 
homes. 
But 
for 
Germany 
the 
case 
was 
quite 
different. 
The 
German 
who 
emigrated 
landed 
in 
the 
territory 
of 
a 
foreign 
country 
and 
found 
himself 
among 
the 
members 
of 
a 
foreign 
nation. 
He 
became 
the 
citizen 
of 
a 
foreign 
state, 
and 
it 
was 
to 
be 
expected 
that 
after 
one, 
two, 
or 
at 
the 
most 
three 
generations, 
his 
attachment 
to 
the 
German 
people 
would 
be 
dissolved 
and 
the 
process 
of 
his 
assimilation 
as 
a 
member 
of 
a 
foreign 
nation 
would 
be 
completed. 
Germany 
was 
faced 
with 
the 
problem 
of 
whether 
it 
was 
to 
look 
on 



with 
indifference 
while 
a 
part 
of 
her 
capital 
and 
her 
people 
emigrated 
overseas. 


One 
must 
not 
fall 
into 
the 
error 
of 
assuming 
that 
the 
problems 
of 
commercial 
policy 
that 
England 
and 
Germany 
had 
to 
face 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
were 
the 
same. 
For 
England, 
it 
was 
a 
question 
of 
whether 
or 
not 
she 
ought 
to 
permit 
a 
number 
of 
her 
sons 
to 
emigrate 
to 
the 
dominions, 
and 
there 
was 
no 
reason 
to 
hinder 
their 
emigration 
in 
any 
way. 
For 
Germany, 
however, 
the 
problem 
was 
whether 
it 
ought 
to 
stand 
by 
quietly 
while 
her 
nationals 
emigrated 
to 
the 
British 
colonies, 
to 
South 
America, 
and 
to 
other 
countries, 
where 
it 
was 
to 
be 
expected 
that 
these 
emigrants, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
time, 
would 
give 
up 
their 
citizenship 
and 
nationality 
just 
as 
hundreds 
of 
thousands, 
indeed, 
millions, 
who 
had 
previously 
emigrated, 
had 
already 
done. 
Because 
it 
did 
not 
want 
this 
to 
happen, 
the 
German 
Empire, 
which 
during 
the 
sixties 
and 
seventies 
had 
been 
approaching 
ever 
more 
closely 
to 
a 
policy 
of 
free 
trade, 
now 
shifted, 
toward 
the 
end 
of 
the 
seventies, 
to 
one 
of 
protectionism 
by 
the 
imposition 
of 
import 
duties 
designed 
to 
shield 
German 
agriculture 
and 
industry 
against 
foreign 
competition. 
Under 
the 
protection 
of 
these 
tariffs 
German 
agriculture 
was 
able 
to 
some 
extent 
to 
bear 
East-European 
and 
overseas 
competition 
from 
farms 
operating 
on 
better 
land, 
and 
German 
industry 
could 
form 
cartels 
that 
kept 
the 
domestic 
price 
above 
the 
price 
on 
the 
world 
market, 
enabling 
it 
to 
use 
the 
profits 
thereby 
realized 
to 
undersell 
its 
competitors 
abroad. 


But 
the 
ultimate 
goal 
that 
was 
aimed 
at 
in 
the 
return 
to 
protectionism 
could 
not 
be 
achieved. 
The 
higher 
living 
and 
production 
costs 
rose 
in 
Germany 
as 
a 
direct 
consequence 
of 
these 
protective 
tariffs, 
the 
more 
difficult 
its 
trade 
position 
necessarily 
became. 
To 
be 
sure, 
it 
was 
possible 
for 
Germany 
to 
make 
a 
mighty 
industrial 
upswing 
in 
the 
first 
three 
decades 
of 
the 
era 
of 
the 
new 
commercial 
policy. 
But 
this 
upswing 
would 
have 
occurred 
even 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
protective 
tariff, 
for 
it 
was 
primarily 
the 
result 
of 
the 
introduction 
of 
new 
methods 
in 
the 
German 
iron 
and 
chemical 
industries, 
which 
enabled 
them 
to 
make 
better 
use 
of 
the 
country’s 
abundant 
natural 
resources. 


Antiliberal 
policy, 
by 
abolishing 
the 
free 
mobility 
of 
labor 
in 
international 
trade 
and 
considerably 
restricting 
even 
the 
mobility 
of 
capital, 
has, 
to 
a 
certain 
extent, 
eliminated 
the 
difference 
that 
existed 
in 
the 
conditions 
of 
international 
trade 
between 
the 
beginning 
and 
the 
end 
of 
the 
nineteenth 



century 
and 
has 
reverted 
to 
those 
prevailing 
at 
the 
time 
the 
doctrine 
of 
free 
trade 
was 
first 
formulated. 
Once 
again 
capital 
and, 
above 
all, 
labor 
are 
hindered 
in 
their 
movements. 
Under 
the 
conditions 
existing 
today, 
unhampered 
trade 
in 
consumers’ 
goods 
could 
not 
give 
rise 
to 
any 
migratory 
movements. 
Once 
again, 
it 
would 
result 
in 
a 
state 
of 
affairs 
in 
which 
the 
individual 
peoples 
of 
the 
world 
would 
be 
engaged 
in 
those 
types 
and 
branches 
of 
production 
for 
which 
the 
relatively 
best 
conditions 
exist 
in 
their 
own 
countries. 


But 
whatever 
may 
be 
the 
prerequisites 
for 
the 
development 
of 
international 
trade, 
protective 
tariffs 
can 
accomplish 
only 
one 
thing: 
to 
prevent 
production 
from 
being 
carried 
on 
where 
the 
natural 
and 
social 
conditions 
are 
most 
favorable 
for 
it 
and 
to 
cause 
it 
to 
be 
carried 
on 
instead 
where 
conditions 
are 
worse. 
The 
outcome 
of 
protectionism 
is, 
therefore, 
always 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
productivity 
of 
human 
labor. 
The 
freetrader 
is 
far 
from 
denying 
that 
the 
evil 
that 
the 
nations 
of 
the 
world 
wish 
to 
combat 
by 
means 
of 
a 
policy 
of 
protectionism 
really 
is 
an 
evil. 
What 
he 
maintains 
is 
only 
that 
the 
means 
recommended 
by 
the 
imperialists 
and 
protectionists 
cannot 
eliminate 
that 
evil. 
He 
therefore 
proposes 
a 
different 
way. 
In 
order 
to 
create 
the 
indispensable 
conditions 
for 
a 
lasting 
peace, 
one 
of 
the 
features 
of 
the 
present 
international 
situation 
that 
the 
liberal 
wishes 
to 
change 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
emigrants 
from 
nations 
like 
Germany 
and 
Italy, 
which 
have 
been 
treated 
like 
stepchildren 
in 
the 
division 
of 
the 
world, 
must 
live 
in 
areas 
in 
which, 
because 
of 
the 
adoption 
of 
antiliberal 
policies, 
they 
are 
condemned 
to 
lose 
their 
nationality. 


8. 
Freedom 
of 
Movement 
Liberalism 
has 
sometimes 
been 
reproached 
on 
the 
ground 
that 
its 
program 
is 
predominantly 
negative. 
This 
follows 
necessarily, 
it 
is 
asserted, 
from 
the 
very 
nature 
of 
freedom, 
which 
can 
be 
conceived 
only 
as 
freedom 
from 
something, 
for 
the 
demand 
for 
freedom 
consists 
essentially 
in 
the 
rejection 
of 
some 
sort 
of 
claim. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
is 
thought, 
the 
program 
of 
the 
authoritarian 
parties 
is 
positive. 
Since 
a 
very 
definite 
value 
judgment 
is 
generally 
connoted 
by 
the 
terms 
“negative” 
and 
“positive,” 
this 
way 
of 
speaking 
already 
involves 
a 
surreptitious 
attempt 
to 
discredit 
the 
political 
program 
of 
liberalism. 



There 
is 
no 
need 
to 
repeat 
here 
once 
again 
that 
the 
liberal 
program—a 
society 
based 
on 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production—is 
no 
less 
positive 
than 
any 
other 
conceivable 
political 
program. 
What 
is 
negative 
in 
the 
liberal 
program 
is 
the 
denial, 
the 
rejection, 
and 
the 
combating 
of 
everything 
that 
stands 
in 
opposition 
to 
this 
positive 
program. 
In 
this 
defensive 
posture, 
the 
program 
of 
liberalism—and, 
for 
that 
matter, 
that 
of 
every 
movement—is 
dependent 
on 
the 
position 
that 
its 
opponents 
assume 
towards 
it. 
Where 
the 
opposition 
is 
strongest, 
the 
assault 
of 
liberalism 
must 
also 
be 
strongest; 
where 
it 
is 
relatively 
weak 
or 
even 
completely 
lacking, 
a 
few 
brief 
words, 
under 
the 
circumstances, 
are 
sufficient. 
And 
since 
the 
opposition 
that 
liberalism 
has 
had 
to 
confront 
has 
changed 
during 
the 
course 
of 
history, 
the 
defensive 
aspect 
of 
the 
liberal 
program 
has 
also 
undergone 
many 
changes. 


This 
becomes 
most 
clearly 
evident 
in 
the 
stand 
that 
it 
takes 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
question 
of 
freedom 
of 
movement. 
The 
liberal 
demands 
that 
every 
person 
have 
the 
right 
to 
live 
wherever 
he 
wants. 
This 
is 
not 
a 
“negative” 
demand. 
It 
belongs 
to 
the 
very 
essence 
of 
a 
society 
based 
on 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
that 
every 
man 
may 
work 
and 
dispose 
of 
his 
earnings 
where 
he 
thinks 
best. 
This 
principle 
takes 
on 
a 
negative 
character 
only 
if 
it 
encounters 
forces 
aiming 
at 
a 
restriction 
of 
freedom 
of 
movement. 
In 
this 
negative 
aspect, 
the 
right 
to 
freedom 
of 
movement 
has, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
time, 
undergone 
a 
complete 
change. 
When 
liberalism 
arose 
in 
the 
eighteenth 
and 
nineteenth 
centuries, 
it 
had 
to 
struggle 
for 
freedom 
of 
emigration. 
Today, 
the 
struggle 
is 
over 
freedom 
of 
immigration. 
At 
that 
time, 
it 
had 
to 
oppose 
laws 
which 
hindered 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
a 
country 
from 
moving 
to 
the 
city 
and 
which 
held 
out 
the 
prospect 
of 
severe 
punishment 
for 
anyone 
who 
wanted 
to 
leave 
his 
native 
land 
in 
order 
to 
better 
himself 
in 
a 
foreign 
land. 
Immigration, 
however, 
was 
at 
that 
time 
generally 
free 
and 
unhampered. 


Today, 
as 
is 
well 
known, 
things 
are 
quite 
different. 
The 
trend 
began 
some 
decades 
ago 
with 
laws 
against 
the 
immigration 
of 
Chinese 
coolies. 
Today 
in 
every 
country 
in 
the 
world 
that 
could 
appear 
inviting 
to 
immigration, 
there 
are 
more 
or 
less 
stringent 
laws 
either 
prohibiting 
it 
entirely 
or 
at 
least 
restricting 
it 
severely. 


This 
policy 
must 
be 
considered 
from 
two 
points 
of 
view: 
first, 
as 
a 
policy 
of 
the 
trade 
unions, 
and 
then 
as 
a 
policy 
of 
national 
protectionism. 


Aside 
from 
such 
coercive 
measures 
as 
the 
closed 
shop, 
compulsory 
strikes, 
and 
violent 
interference 
with 
those 
willing 
to 
work, 
the 
only 
way 
the 



trade 
unions 
can 
have 
any 
influence 
on 
the 
labor 
market 
is 
by 
restricting 
the 
supply 
of 
labor. 
But 
since 
it 
is 
not 
within 
the 
power 
of 
the 
trade 
unions 
to 
reduce 
the 
number 
of 
workers 
living 
in 
the 
world, 
the 
only 
other 
possibility 
remaining 
open 
to 
them 
is 
to 
block 
access 
to 
employment, 
and 
thus 
diminish 
the 
number 
of 
workers, 
in 
one 
branch 
of 
industry 
or 
in 
one 
country 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
workers 
employed 
in 
other 
industries 
or 
living 
in 
other 
countries. 
For 
reasons 
of 
practical 
politics, 
it 
is 
possible 
only 
to 
a 
limited 
extent 
for 
those 
engaged 
in 
a 
particular 
branch 
of 
industry 
to 
bar 
from 
it 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
workers 
in 
the 
country. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
no 
special 
political 
difficulty 
is 
involved 
in 
imposing 
such 
restrictions 
on 
the 
entrance 
of 
foreign 
labor. 


The 
natural 
conditions 
of 
production 
and, 
concomitantly, 
the 
productivity 
of 
labor 
are 
more 
favorable, 
and, 
as 
a 
consequence, 
wage 
rates 
are 
higher, 
in 
the 
United 
States 
than 
in 
vast 
areas 
of 
Europe. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
immigration 
barriers, 
European 
workers 
would 
emigrate 
to 
the 
United 
States 
in 
great 
numbers 
to 
look 
for 
jobs. 
The 
American 
immigration 
laws 
make 
this 
exceptionally 
difficult. 
Thus, 
the 
wages 
of 
labor 
in 
the 
United 
States 
are 
kept 
above 
the 
height 
that 
they 
would 
reach 
if 
there 
were 
full 
freedom 
of 
migration, 
whereas 
in 
Europe 
they 
are 
depressed 
below 
this 
height. 
On 
the 
one 
hand, 
the 
American 
worker 
gains; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
European 
worker 
loses. 


However, 
it 
would 
be 
a 
mistake 
to 
consider 
the 
consequences 
of 
immigration 
barriers 
exclusively 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
their 
immediate 
effect 
on 
wages. 
They 
go 
further. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
relative 
oversupply 
of 
labor 
in 
areas 
with 
comparatively 
unfavorable 
conditions 
of 
production, 
and 
the 
relative 
shortage 
of 
labor 
in 
areas 
in 
which 
the 
conditions 
of 
production 
are 
comparatively 
favorable, 
production 
is 
further 
expanded 
in 
the 
former 
and 
more 
restricted 
in 
the 
latter 
than 
would 
be 
the 
case 
if 
there 
were 
full 
freedom 
of 
migration. 
Thus, 
the 
effects 
of 
restricting 
this 
freedom 
are 
just 
the 
same 
as 
those 
of 
a 
protective 
tariff. 
In 
one 
part 
of 
the 
world 
comparatively 
favorable 
opportunities 
for 
production 
are 
not 
utilized, 
while 
in 
another 
part 
of 
the 
world 
less 
favorable 
opportunities 
for 
production 
are 
being 
exploited. 
Looked 
at 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
humanity, 
the 
result 
is 
a 
lowering 
of 
the 
productivity 
of 
human 
labor, 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
supply 
of 
goods 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
mankind. 


Attempts 
to 
justify 
on 
economic 
grounds 
the 
policy 
of 
restricting 



immigration 
are 
therefore 
doomed 
from 
the 
outset. 
There 
cannot 
be 
the 
slightest 
doubt 
that 
migration 
barriers 
diminish 
the 
productivity 
of 
human 
labor. 
When 
the 
trade 
unions 
of 
the 
United 
States 
or 
Australia 
hinder 
immigration, 
they 
are 
fighting 
not 
only 
against 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
workers 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
world, 
but 
also 
against 
the 
interests 
of 
everyone 
else 
in 
order 
to 
secure 
a 
special 
privilege 
for 
themselves. 
For 
all 
that, 
it 
still 
remains 
quite 
uncertain 
whether 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
general 
productivity 
of 
human 
labor 
which 
could 
be 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
establishment 
of 
complete 
freedom 
of 
migration 
would 
not 
be 
so 
great 
as 
to 
compensate 
entirely 
the 
members 
of 
the 
American 
and 
Australian 
trade 
unions 
for 
the 
losses 
that 
they 
could 
suffer 
from 
the 
immigration 
of 
foreign 
workers. 


The 
workers 
of 
the 
United 
States 
and 
Australia 
could 
not 
succeed 
in 
having 
restrictions 
imposed 
on 
immigration 
if 
they 
did 
not 
have 
still 
another 
argument 
to 
fall 
back 
upon 
in 
support 
of 
their 
policy. 
After 
all, 
even 
today 
the 
power 
of 
certain 
liberal 
principles 
and 
ideas 
is 
so 
great 
that 
one 
cannot 
combat 
them 
if 
one 
does 
not 
place 
allegedly 
higher 
and 
more 
important 
considerations 
above 
the 
interest 
in 
the 
attainment 
of 
maximum 
productivity. 
We 
have 
already 
seen 
how 
“national 
interests” 
are 
cited 
in 
justification 
of 
protective 
tariffs. 
The 
same 
considerations 
are 
also 
invoked 
in 
favor 
of 
restrictions 
on 
immigration. 


In 
the 
absence 
of 
any 
migration 
barriers 
whatsoever, 
vast 
hordes 
of 
immigrants 
from 
the 
comparatively 
overpopulated 
areas 
of 
Europe 
would, 
it 
is 
maintained, 
inundate 
Australia 
and 
America. 
They 
would 
come 
in 
such 
great 
numbers 
that 
it 
would 
no 
longer 
be 
possible 
to 
count 
on 
their 
assimilation. 
If 
in 
the 
past 
immigrants 
to 
America 
soon 
adopted 
the 
English 
language 
and 
American 
ways 
and 
customs, 
this 
was 
in 
part 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
did 
not 
come 
over 
all 
at 
once 
in 
such 
great 
numbers. 
The 
small 
groups 
of 
immigrants 
who 
distributed 
themselves 
over 
a 
wide 
land 
quickly 
integrated 
themselves 
into 
the 
great 
body 
of 
the 
American 
people. 
The 
individual 
immigrant 
was 
already 
half 
assimilated 
when 
the 
next 
immigrants 
landed 
on 
American 
soil. 
One 
of 
the 
most 
important 
reasons 
for 
this 
rapid 
national 
assimilation 
was 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
immigrants 
from 
foreign 
countries 
did 
not 
come 
in 
too 
great 
numbers. 
This, 
it 
is 
believed, 
would 
now 
change, 
and 
there 
is 
real 
danger 
that 
the 
ascendancy—or 
more 
correctly, 
the 
exclusive 
dominion—of 
the 
Anglo-Saxons 
in 
the 
United 
States 
would 
be 
destroyed. 



This 
is 
especially 
to 
be 
feared 
in 
the 
case 
of 
heavy 
immigration 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
Mongolian 
peoples 
of 
Asia. 


These 
fears 
may 
perhaps 
be 
exaggerated 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
United 
States. 
As 
regards 
Australia, 
they 
certainly 
are 
not. 
Australia 
has 
approximately 
the 
same 
number 
of 
inhabitants 
as 
Austria; 
its 
area, 
however, 
is 
a 
hundred 
times 
greater 
than 
Austria’s, 
and 
its 
natural 
resources 
are 
certainly 
incomparably 
richer. 
If 
Australia 
were 
thrown 
open 
to 
immigration, 
it 
can 
be 
assumed 
with 
great 
probability 
that 
its 
population 
would 
in 
a 
few 
years 
consist 
mostly 
of 
Japanese, 
Chinese, 
and 
Malayans. 


The 
aversion 
that 
most 
people 
feel 
today 
towards 
the 
members 
of 
foreign 
nationalities 
and 
especially 
towards 
those 
of 
other 
races 
is 
evidently 
too 
great 
to 
admit 
of 
any 
peaceful 
settlement 
of 
such 
antagonisms. 
It 
is 
scarcely 
to 
be 
expected 
that 
the 
Australians 
will 
voluntarily 
permit 
the 
immigration 
of 
Europeans 
not 
of 
English 
nationality, 
and 
it 
is 
completely 
out 
of 
the 
question 
that 
they 
should 
permit 
Asiatics 
too 
to 
seek 
work 
and 
a 
permanent 
home 
in 
their 
continent. 
The 
Australians 
of 
English 
descent 
insist 
that 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
was 
the 
English 
who 
first 
opened 
up 
this 
land 
for 
settlement 
has 
given 
the 
English 
people 
a 
special 
right 
to 
the 
exclusive 
possession 
of 
the 
entire 
continent 
for 
all 
time 
to 
come. 
The 
members 
of 
the 
world’s 
other 
nationalities, 
however, 
do 
not 
in 
the 
least 
desire 
to 
contest 
the 
right 
of 
the 
Australians 
to 
occupy 
any 
of 
the 
land 
that 
they 
already 
are 
making 
use 
of 
in 
Australia. 
They 
think 
only 
that 
it 
is 
unfair 
that 
the 
Australians 
do 
not 
permit 
the 
utilization 
of 
more 
favorable 
conditions 
of 
production 
that 
today 
lie 
fallow 
and 
force 
them 
to 
carry 
on 
production 
under 
the 
less 
favorable 
conditions 
prevailing 
in 
their 
own 
countries. 


This 
issue 
is 
of 
the 
most 
momentous 
significance 
for 
the 
future 
of 
the 
world. 
Indeed, 
the 
fate 
of 
civilization 
depends 
on 
its 
satisfactory 
resolution. 
On 
the 
one 
side 
stand 
scores, 
indeed, 
hundreds 
of 
millions 
of 
Europeans 
and 
Asiatics 
who 
are 
compelled 
to 
work 
under 
less 
favorable 
conditions 
of 
production 
than 
they 
could 
find 
in 
the 
territories 
from 
which 
they 
are 
barred. 
They 
demand 
that 
the 
gates 
of 
the 
forbidden 
paradise 
be 
opened 
to 
them 
so 
that 
they 
may 
increase 
the 
productivity 
of 
their 
labor 
and 
thereby 
receive 
for 
themselves 
a 
higher 
standard 
of 
living. 
On 
the 
other 
side 
stand 
those 
already 
fortunate 
enough 
to 
call 
their 
own 
the 
land 
with 
the 
more 
favorable 
conditions 
of 
production. 
They 
desire—as 
far 
as 
they 
are 
workers, 
and 
not 
owners 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production—not 
to 
give 
up 
the 
higher 
wages 
that 
this 



position 
guarantees 
them. 
The 
entire 
nation, 
however, 
is 
unanimous 
in 
fearing 
inundation 
by 
foreigners. 
The 
present 
inhabitants 
of 
these 
favored 
lands 
fear 
that 
some 
day 
they 
could 
be 
reduced 
to 
a 
minority 
in 
their 
own 
country 
and 
that 
they 
would 
then 
have 
to 
suffer 
all 
the 
horrors 
of 
national 
persecution 
to 
which, 
for 
instance, 
the 
Germans 
are 
today 
exposed 
in 
Czechoslovakia, 
Italy, 
and 
Poland. 


It 
cannot 
be 
denied 
that 
these 
fears 
are 
justified. 
Because 
of 
the 
enormous 
power 
that 
today 
stands 
at 
the 
command 
of 
the 
state, 
a 
national 
minority 
must 
expect 
the 
worst 
from 
a 
majority 
of 
a 
different 
nationality. 
As 
long 
as 
the 
state 
is 
granted 
the 
vast 
powers 
which 
it 
has 
today 
and 
which 
public 
opinion 
considers 
to 
be 
its 
right, 
the 
thought 
of 
having 
to 
live 
in 
a 
state 
whose 
government 
is 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
members 
of 
a 
foreign 
nationality 
is 
positively 
terrifying. 
It 
is 
frightful 
to 
live 
in 
a 
state 
in 
which 
at 
every 
turn 
one 
is 
exposed 
to 
persecution—masquerading 
under 
the 
guise 
of 
justice—by 
a 
ruling 
majority. 
It 
is 
dreadful 
to 
be 
handicapped 
even 
as 
a 
child 
in 
school 
on 
account 
of 
one’s 
nationality 
and 
to 
be 
in 
the 
wrong 
before 
every 
judicial 
and 
administrative 
authority 
because 
one 
belongs 
to 
a 
national 
minority. 


If 
one 
considers 
the 
conflict 
from 
this 
point 
of 
view, 
it 
seems 
as 
if 
it 
allows 
of 
no 
other 
solution 
than 
war. 
In 
that 
case, 
it 
is 
to 
be 
expected 
that 
the 
nation 
inferior 
in 
numbers 
will 
be 
defeated, 
that, 
for 
example, 
the 
nations 
of 
Asia, 
counting 
hundreds 
of 
millions, 
will 
succeed 
in 
driving 
the 
progeny 
of 
the 
white 
race 
from 
Australia. 
But 
we 
do 
not 
wish 
to 
indulge 
in 
such 
conjectures. 
For 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
such 
wars—and 
we 
must 
assume 
that 
a 
world 
problem 
of 
such 
great 
dimensions 
cannot 
be 
solved 
once 
and 
for 
all 
in 
just 
one 
war—would 
lead 
to 
the 
most 
frightful 
catastrophe 
for 
civilization. 


It 
is 
clear 
that 
no 
solution 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
immigration 
is 
possible 
if 
one 
adheres 
to 
the 
ideal 
of 
the 
interventionist 
state, 
which 
meddles 
in 
every 
field 
of 
human 
activity, 
or 
to 
that 
of 
the 
socialist 
state. 
Only 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
liberal 
program 
could 
make 
the 
problem 
of 
immigration, 
which 
today 
seems 
insoluble, 
completely 
disappear. 
In 
an 
Australia 
governed 
according 
to 
liberal 
principles, 
what 
difficulties 
could 
arise 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
some 
parts 
of 
the 
continent 
Japanese 
and 
in 
other 
parts 
Englishmen 
were 
in 
the 
majority? 


9. 
The 
United 
States 
of 
Europe 
The 
United 
States 
of 
America 
is 
the 
mightiest 
and 
richest 
nation 
in 
the 



world. 
Nowhere 
else 
was 
capitalism 
able 
to 
develop 
more 
freely 
and 
with 
less 
interference 
from 
the 
government. 
The 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
are 
therefore 
far 
richer 
than 
those 
of 
any 
other 
country 
on 
earth. 
For 
more 
than 
sixty 
years 
their 
country 
was 
not 
involved 
in 
any 
war. 
If 
they 
had 
not 
waged 
a 
war 
of 
extermination 
against 
the 
original 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
land, 
if 
they 
had 
not 
needlessly 
waged 
war 
against 
Spain 
in 
1898, 
and 
if 
they 
had 
not 
participated 
in 
the 
World 
War, 
only 
a 
few 
graybeards 
among 
them 
would 
today 
be 
able 
to 
give 
a 
first-hand 
account 
of 
what 
war 
means. 
It 
is 
doubtful 
whether 
the 
Americans 
themselves 
appreciate 
how 
much 
they 
owe 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
more 
of 
the 
policies 
of 
liberalism 
and 
capitalism 
have 
been 
realized 
in 
their 
country 
than 
in 
any 
other. 
Even 
foreigners 
do 
not 
know 
what 
it 
is 
that 
has 
made 
the 
much-envied 
republic 
rich 
and 
powerful. 
But—apart 
from 
those 
who, 
filled 
with 
resentment, 
affect 
a 
profound 
contempt 
for 
the 
“materialism” 
of 
American 
culture—all 
are 
agreed 
in 
desiring 
nothing 
more 
eagerly 
than 
that 
their 
country 
should 
be 
as 
rich 
and 
as 
powerful 
as 
the 
United 
States. 


In 
various 
quarters 
it 
is 
being 
proposed, 
as 
the 
simplest 
way 
to 
achieve 
this 
end, 
that 
a 
“United 
States 
of 
Europe” 
be 
formed. 
By 
themselves 
the 
individual 
countries 
of 
the 
European 
continent 
are 
too 
thinly 
populated 
and 
do 
not 
have 
enough 
land 
at 
their 
disposal 
to 
be 
able 
to 
hold 
their 
own 
in 
the 
international 
struggle 
for 
supremacy 
as 
against 
the 
ever 
increasing 
power 
of 
the 
United 
States, 
against 
Russia, 
against 
the 
British 
Empire, 
against 
China, 
and 
against 
other 
groupings 
of 
similar 
size 
that 
may 
be 
formed 
in 
the 
future, 
perhaps 
in 
South 
America. 
They 
must 
therefore 
consolidate 
into 
a 
military 
and 
political 
union, 
into 
a 
defensive 
and 
offensive 
alliance, 
which 
alone 
would 
be 
capable 
of 
assuring 
to 
Europe 
in 
the 
centuries 
to 
come 
the 
importance 
in 
world 
politics 
that 
it 
has 
enjoyed 
in 
the 
past. 
What 
gives 
special 
support 
to 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
Pan-European 
union 
is 
the 
realization, 
which 
is 
every 
day 
impressing 
itself 
more 
strongly 
on 
everyone, 
that 
nothing 
can 
be 
more 
absurd 
than 
the 
protective 
tariff 
policies 
presently 
being 
pursued 
by 
the 
nations 
of 
Europe. 
Only 
the 
further 
development 
of 
the 
international 
division 
of 
labor 
can 
increase 
the 
well-being 
and 
produce 
the 
abundance 
of 
goods 
needed 
to 
raise 
the 
standard 
of 
living, 
and 
thereby 
also 
the 
cultural 
level, 
of 
the 
masses. 
The 
economic 
policies 
of 
all 
countries, 
but 
especially 
those 
of 
the 
smaller 
European 
nations, 
are 
aimed 
precisely 
at 
destroying 
the 
international 
division 
of 
labor. 
If 
the 
conditions 
under 
which 
American 
industry 
operates, 
with 
a 
potential 
market 
of 
more 
than 
a 
hundred 
twenty 
million 
rich 



consumers, 
unhampered 
by 
tariffs 
or 
similar 
obstacles, 
are 
compared 
with 
those 
against 
which 
German, 
Czechoslovakian, 
or 
Hungarian 
industry 
must 
contend, 
the 
utter 
absurdity 
of 
endeavors 
to 
create 
little 
autarkic 
economic 
territories 
becomes 
immediately 
obvious. 


The 
evils 
that 
those 
who 
champion 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
United 
States 
of 
Europe 
are 
trying 
to 
combat 
undoubtedly 
exist, 
and 
the 
sooner 
they 
are 
eliminated, 
the 
better. 
But 
the 
formation 
of 
a 
United 
States 
of 
Europe 
would 
not 
be 
an 
appropriate 
means 
to 
achieve 
this 
end. 


Any 
reform 
in 
international 
relations 
must 
aim 
at 
abolishing 
a 
situation 
in 
which 
each 
country 
seeks 
in 
every 
way 
possible 
to 
enlarge 
its 
territory 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
other 
countries. 
The 
problem 
of 
international 
boundaries, 
which 
has 
assumed 
such 
overwhelming 
importance 
today, 
must 
lose 
all 
its 
significance. 
The 
nations 
must 
come 
to 
realize 
that 
the 
most 
important 
problem 
of 
foreign 
policy 
is 
the 
establishment 
of 
lasting 
peace, 
and 
they 
must 
understand 
that 
this 
can 
be 
assured 
throughout 
the 
world 
only 
if 
the 
field 
of 
activity 
permitted 
to 
the 
state 
is 
limited 
to 
the 
narrowest 
range. 
Only 
then 
will 
the 
size 
and 
extent 
of 
the 
territory 
subject 
to 
the 
sovereignty 
of 
the 
state 
no 
longer 
assume 
such 
overwhelming 
importance 
for 
the 
life 
of 
the 
individual 
as 
to 
make 
it 
seem 
natural, 
now 
as 
in 
the 
past, 
for 
rivers 
of 
blood 
to 
be 
shed 
in 
disputes 
over 
boundaries. 
The 
narrow-mindedness 
which 
sees 
nothing 
beyond 
one’s 
own 
state 
and 
one’s 
own 
nation 
and 
which 
has 
no 
conception 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
international 
cooperation 
must 
be 
replaced 
by 
a 
cosmopolitan 
outlook. 
This, 
however, 
is 
possible 
only 
if 
the 
society 
of 
nations, 
the 
international 
superstate, 
is 
so 
constituted 
that 
no 
people 
and 
no 
individual 
is 
oppressed 
on 
account 
of 
nationality 
or 
national 
peculiarities. 


Nationalist 
policies, 
which 
always 
begin 
by 
aiming 
at 
the 
ruination 
of 
one’s 
neighbor, 
must, 
in 
the 
final 
analysis, 
lead 
to 
the 
ruination 
of 
all. 
In 
order 
to 
overcome 
such 
provincialism 
and 
to 
replace 
it 
by 
a 
policy 
genuinely 
cosmopolitan 
in 
its 
orientation, 
it 
is 
first 
necessary 
for 
the 
nations 
of 
the 
world 
to 
realize 
that 
their 
interests 
do 
not 
stand 
in 
mutual 
opposition 
and 
that 
every 
nation 
best 
serves 
its 
own 
cause 
when 
it 
is 
intent 
on 
promoting 
the 
development 
of 
all 
nations 
and 
scrupulously 
abstains 
from 
every 
attempt 
to 
use 
violence 
against 
other 
nations 
or 
parts 
of 
other 
nations. 
Thus, 
what 
is 
needed 
is 
not 
the 
replacement 
of 
national 
chauvinism 
by 
a 
chauvinism 
that 
would 
have 
some 
larger, 
supranational 
entity 
for 
its 
object, 
but 
rather 
the 
recognition 
that 
every 
sort 
of 
chauvinism 
is 
mistaken. 
The 
old, 
militaristic 



methods 
of 
international 
politics 
must 
now 
give 
way 
to 
new, 
peaceful 
methods 
aiming 
at 
cooperative 
effort, 
and 
not 
at 
mutual 
warfare. 


The 
champions 
of 
Pan-Europe 
and 
of 
the 
United 
States 
of 
Europe, 
however, 
have 
other 
ends 
in 
view. 
They 
do 
not 
plan 
on 
establishing 
a 
new 
kind 
of 
state 
different 
in 
its 
policies 
from 
the 
imperialistic 
and 
militaristic 
states 
that 
have 
existed 
up 
to 
now, 
but 
on 
a 
reconstitution 
of 
the 
old 
imperialistic 
and 
militaristic 
idea 
of 
the 
state. 
Pan-Europe 
is 
to 
be 
greater 
than 
the 
individual 
states 
that 
will 
comprise 
it; 
it 
is 
to 
be 
more 
powerful 
than 
they 
are 
and 
therefore 
more 
efficient 
militarily 
and 
better 
suited 
to 
oppose 
such 
great 
powers 
as 
England, 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America, 
and 
Russia. 
A 
European 
chauvinism 
is 
to 
take 
the 
place 
of 
the 
French, 
the 
German, 
or 
the 
Hungarian 
variety; 
a 
united 
front 
formed 
of 
all 
the 
European 
nations 
is 
to 
be 
directed 
against 
“foreigners”: 
Britons, 
Americans, 
Russians, 
Chinese, 
and 
Japanese. 


Now 
one 
can 
base 
a 
chauvinistic 
political 
consciousness 
and 
a 
chauvinistic 
military 
policy 
on 
a 
national 
foundation, 
but 
not 
on 
a 
geographic 
one. 
Community 
of 
language 
binds 
members 
of 
the 
same 
nationality 
close 
together, 
while 
linguistic 
diversity 
gives 
rise 
to 
a 
gulf 
between 
nations. 
If 
it 
were 
not 
for 
this 
fact—aside 
from 
all 
ideologies—chauvinistic 
thinking 
would 
never 
have 
been 
able 
to 
develop. 
The 
geographer, 
with 
map 
in 
hand, 
may, 
no 
doubt, 
very 
well 
view 
the 
European 
continent 
(with 
the 
exception 
of 
Russia) 
as 
a 
unity 
if 
he 
is 
so 
minded; 
but 
this 
does 
not 
create 
among 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
that 
region 
any 
feeling 
of 
community 
or 
solidarity 
on 
which 
the 
statesman 
could 
base 
his 
plans. 
A 
Rhinelander 
can 
be 
made 
to 
understand 
that 
he 
is 
defending 
his 
own 
cause 
if 
he 
goes 
into 
battle 
for 
the 
Germans 
of 
East 
Prussia. 
It 
may 
even 
be 
possible 
to 
bring 
him 
to 
see 
that 
the 
cause 
of 
all 
mankind 
is 
also 
his 
own 
cause. 
But 
he 
will 
never 
be 
able 
to 
understand 
that, 
while 
he 
has 
to 
stand 
side 
by 
side 
with 
the 
Portuguese 
because 
they 
too 
are 
Europeans, 
the 
cause 
of 
England 
is 
that 
of 
an 
enemy, 
or, 
at 
best, 
of 
a 
neutral 
alien. 
It 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
efface 
from 
men’s 
minds 
(nor, 
incidentally, 
does 
liberalism 
have 
any 
desire 
to 
do 
so) 
the 
imprint 
left 
by 
a 
long 
historical 
development 
that 
has 
brought 
it 
about 
that 
the 
heart 
of 
a 
German 
beats 
faster 
at 
every 
mention 
of 
Germany, 
of 
the 
German 
people, 
or 
of 
all 
that 
is 
typically 
German. 
This 
feeling 
of 
nationality 
existed 
before 
any 
political 
attempt 
was 
made 
to 
base 
upon 
it 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
German 
state, 
a 
German 
policy, 
and 
German 
chauvinism. 
All 
the 
well-intentioned 
schemes 
for 
replacing 
national 



states 
by 
a 
federation 
of 
states, 
whether 
Central 
European, 
Pan-European, 
Pan-American, 
or 
constructed 
on 
some 
similar 
artificial 
basis, 
suffer 
from 
the 
same 
fundamental 
defect. 
They 
fail 
to 
take 
account 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
words 
“Europe” 
or 
“Pan-Europe” 
and 
“European” 
or 
“Pan-European” 
do 
not 
have 
this 
kind 
of 
emotional 
connotation 
and 
are 
thus 
incapable 
of 
evoking 
sentiments 
of 
the 
kind 
called 
forth 
by 
such 
words 
as 
“Germany” 
and 
“German.” 


The 
matter 
may 
be 
seen 
in 
its 
clearest 
light 
if 
we 
direct 
our 
attention 
to 
the 
problem, 
which 
plays 
a 
decisive 
role 
in 
all 
these 
projects, 
of 
agreeing 
on 
a 
commercial 
policy 
for 
such 
a 
federation 
of 
states. 
As 
conditions 
are 
today, 
a 
Bavarian 
can 
be 
induced 
to 
regard 
the 
protection 
of 
German 
labor—let 
us 
say, 
in 
Saxony—as 
a 
sufficient 
justification 
for 
a 
tariff 
that 
makes 
it 
more 
expensive 
for 
him, 
the 
Bavarian, 
to 
purchase 
some 
article. 
We 
may 
hope 
that 
some 
day 
he 
will 
succeed 
in 
being 
converted 
to 
the 
realization 
that 
all 
political 
measures 
designed 
to 
achieve 
autarky, 
and 
hence 
all 
protective 
tariffs, 
are 
senseless 
and 
self-defeating 
and 
consequently 
ought 
to 
be 
abolished. 
But 
never 
will 
one 
succeed 
in 
inducing 
a 
Pole 
or 
a 
Hungarian 
to 
consider 
it 
justified 
that 
he 
should 
pay 
more 
than 
the 
world 
market 
price 
for 
any 
commodity 
merely 
in 
order 
to 
enable 
the 
French, 
the 
Germans, 
or 
the 
Italians 
to 
carry 
on 
its 
production 
in 
their 
countries. 
One 
can 
certainly 
win 
support 
for 
a 
policy 
of 
protectionism 
by 
combining 
an 
appeal 
to 
feelings 
of 
national 
solidarity 
with 
the 
nationalistic 
doctrine 
that 
the 
interests 
of 
different 
nations 
are 
mutually 
incompatible; 
but 
there 
is 
nothing 
similar 
that 
could 
serve 
a 
federation 
of 
states 
as 
an 
ideological 
basis 
for 
a 
system 
of 
protectionism. 
It 
is 
manifestly 
absurd 
to 
break 
up 
the 
ever 
increasing 
unity 
of 
world 
economy 
into 
a 
number 
of 
small 
national 
territories, 
each 
as 
autarkic 
as 
possible. 
But 
one 
cannot 
counteract 
the 
policy 
of 
economic 
isolation 
on 
a 
national 
scale 
by 
replacing 
it 
with 
the 
same 
policy 
on 
the 
part 
of 
a 
larger 
political 
entity 
comprising 
a 
number 
of 
different 
nationalities. 
The 
only 
way 
to 
counteract 
tendencies 
toward 
protectionism 
and 
autarky 
is 
to 
recognize 
their 
harmfulness 
and 
to 
appreciate 
the 
harmony 
of 
the 
interests 
of 
all 
nations. 


Once 
it 
has 
been 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
disintegration 
of 
the 
world 
economy 
into 
a 
number 
of 
small 
autarkic 
areas 
has 
detrimental 
consequences 
for 
all 
nations, 
the 
conclusion 
in 
favor 
of 
free 
trade 
necessarily 
follows. 
In 
order 
to 
prove 
that 
a 
Pan-European 
zone 
of 
autarky 
should 
be 
set 
up 
under 
the 
shelter 
of 
a 
protective 
tariff, 
it 
would 
first 
be 
necessary 
to 
demonstrate 



that 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
Portuguese 
and 
the 
Rumanians, 
although 
in 
harmony 
with 
each 
other, 
both 
collide 
with 
those 
of 
Brazil 
and 
Russia. 
One 
would 
have 
to 
adduce 
proof 
that 
it 
is 
good 
for 
the 
Hungarians 
to 
give 
up 
their 
domestic 
textile 
industry 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
German, 
the 
French, 
and 
the 
Belgian, 
but 
that 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
Hungarians 
would 
be 
injured 
by 
the 
importation 
of 
English 
or 
American 
textiles. 


The 
movement 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
formation 
of 
a 
federation 
of 
European 
states 
has 
arisen 
from 
a 
correct 
recognition 
of 
the 
untenability 
of 
all 
forms 
of 
chauvinistic 
nationalism. 
But 
what 
the 
supporters 
of 
this 
movement 
wish 
to 
set 
in 
its 
place 
is 
impracticable 
because 
it 
lacks 
a 
vital 
basis 
in 
the 
consciousness 
of 
the 
people. 
And 
even 
if 
the 
goal 
of 
the 
Pan-European 
movement 
could 
be 
achieved, 
the 
world 
would 
not 
be 
in 
the 
least 
the 
better 
for 
it. 
The 
struggle 
of 
a 
united 
European 
continent 
against 
the 
great 
world 
powers 
outside 
its 
territory 
would 
be 
no 
less 
ruinous 
than 
is 
the 
present 
struggle 
of 
the 
countries 
of 
Europe 
among 
themselves. 


10. 
The 
League 
of 
Nations 
Just 
as, 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
liberal, 
the 
state 
is 
not 
the 
highest 
ideal, 
so 
it 
is 
also 
not 
the 
best 
apparatus 
of 
compulsion. 
The 
metaphysical 
theory 
of 
the 
state 
declares—approaching, 
in 
this 
respect, 
the 
vanity 
and 
presumption 
of 
the 
absolute 
monarchs—that 
each 
individual 
state 
is 
sovereign, 
i.e., 
that 
it 
represents 
the 
last 
and 
highest 
court 
of 
appeals. 
But, 
for 
the 
liberal, 
the 
world 
does 
not 
end 
at 
the 
borders 
of 
the 
state. 
In 
his 
eyes, 
whatever 
significance 
national 
boundaries 
have 
is 
only 
incidental 
and 
subordinate. 
His 
political 
thinking 
encompasses 
the 
whole 
of 
mankind. 
The 
starting-point 
of 
his 
entire 
political 
philosophy 
is 
the 
conviction 
that 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
is 
international 
and 
not 
merely 
national. 
He 
realizes 
from 
the 
very 
first 
that 
it 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
establish 
peace 
within 
each 
country, 
that 
it 
is 
much 
more 
important 
that 
all 
nations 
live 
at 
peace 
with 
one 
another. 
The 
liberal 
therefore 
demands 
that 
the 
political 
organization 
of 
society 
be 
extended 
until 
it 
reaches 
its 
culmination 
in 
a 
world 
state 
that 
unites 
all 
nations 
on 
an 
equal 
basis. 
For 
this 
reason 
he 
sees 
the 
law 
of 
each 
nation 
as 
subordinate 
to 
international 
law, 
and 
that 
is 
why 
he 
demands 
supranational 
tribunals 
and 
administrative 
authorities 
to 
assure 
peace 
among 
nations 
in 
the 
same 
way 
that 
the 
judicial 
and 
executive 
organs 
of 
each 
country 
are 
charged 
with 
the 
maintenance 
of 
peace 
within 
its 
own 



territory. 


For 
a 
long 
time 
the 
demand 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
such 
a 
supranational 
world 
organization 
was 
confined 
to 
a 
few 
thinkers 
who 
were 
considered 
Utopians 
and 
went 
unheeded. 
To 
be 
sure, 
after 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Napoleonic 
Wars, 
the 
world 
repeatedly 
witnessed 
the 
spectacle 
of 
the 
statesmen 
of 
the 
leading 
powers 
gathered 
around 
the 
conference 
table 
to 
arrive 
at 
a 
common 
accord, 
and 
after 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
an 
increasing 
number 
of 
supranational 
institutions 
were 
established, 
the 
most 
widely 
noted 
of 
which 
are 
the 
Red 
Cross 
and 
the 
International 
Postal 
Union. 
Yet 
all 
of 
this 
was 
still 
a 
very 
far 
cry 
from 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
genuine 
supranational 
organization. 
Even 
the 
Hague 
Peace 
Conference 
signified 
hardly 
any 
progress 
in 
this 
respect. 
It 
was 
only 
the 
horrors 
of 
the 
World 
War 
that 
first 
made 
it 
possible 
to 
win 
widespread 
support 
for 
the 
idea 
of 
an 
organization 
of 
all 
nations 
that 
would 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
prevent 
future 
conflicts. 
With 
the 
end 
of 
the 
war, 
the 
victors 
took 
steps 
to 
create 
an 
association 
which 
they 
called 
“The 
League 
of 
Nations” 
and 
which 
is 
widely 
held 
throughout 
the 
world 
to 
be 
the 
nucleus 
of 
what 
could 
be 
a 
really 
effective 
future 
international 
organization. 


In 
any 
case, 
there 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
that 
what 
today 
goes 
under 
that 
name 
is 
in 
no 
way 
a 
realization 
of 
the 
liberal 
ideal 
of 
a 
supranational 
organization. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
some 
of 
the 
most 
important 
and 
powerful 
nations 
of 
the 
world 
do 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
League 
at 
all. 
The 
United 
States, 
not 
to 
mention 
smaller 
nations, 
still 
stands 
outside. 
Besides, 
the 
covenant 
of 
the 
League 
of 
Nations 
suffers 
from 
the 
very 
outset 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
distinguishes 
between 
two 
categories 
of 
member 
states: 
those 
that 
enjoy 
full 
rights 
and 
those 
that, 
having 
been 
on 
the 
losing 
side 
in 
the 
World 
War, 
are 
not 
fully 
qualified 
members. 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
such 
an 
inequality 
of 
status 
in 
the 
community 
of 
nations 
must 
bear 
within 
itself 
the 
seeds 
of 
war 
in 
the 
same 
way 
that 
every 
such 
division 
into 
castes 
does 
within 
a 
country. 
All 
these 
shortcomings 
have 
combined 
to 
weaken 
the 
League 
lamentably 
and 
to 
render 
it 
impotent 
in 
regard 
to 
all 
the 
substantive 
questions 
with 
which 
it 
has 
been 
confronted. 
One 
has 
only 
to 
think 
of 
its 
conduct 
in 
the 
conflict 
between 
Italy 
and 
Greece 
or 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
Mosul 
question, 
and 
especially 
in 
those 
cases 
in 
which 
the 
fate 
of 
oppressed 
minorities 
depended 
on 
its 
decision. 


There 
are 
in 
all 
countries, 
but 
especially 
in 
England 
and 
Germany, 
groups 
that 
believe 
that 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
transforming 
this 
sham 
League 
of 
Nations 
into 
a 
real 
one—into 
a 
genuine 
supranational 
state—its 
present 



weaknesses 
and 
defects 
should 
be 
treated 
in 
the 
most 
indulgent 
possible 
way. 
Such 
opportunism 
never 
does 
any 
good, 
no 
matter 
what 
question 
is 
at 
issue. 
The 
League 
of 
Nations 
is—and 
this 
would 
certainly 
have 
to 
be 
conceded 
by 
everybody 
except 
the 
functionaries 
and 
the 
staff 
employed 
in 
its 
bureaus—an 
inadequate 
institution 
in 
no 
way 
corresponding 
to 
the 
demands 
that 
one 
is 
entitled 
to 
make 
of 
a 
world 
organization. 
This 
fact, 
far 
from 
being 
minimized 
or 
ignored, 
needs 
to 
be 
repeatedly 
and 
insistently 
emphasized 
so 
that 
attention 
is 
called 
to 
all 
the 
changes 
that 
would 
have 
to 
be 
made 
in 
order 
to 
transform 
this 
sham 
into 
a 
real 
League 
of 
Nations. 
Nothing 
has 
done 
greater 
harm 
to 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
supranational 
world 
organization 
than 
the 
intellectual 
confusion 
arising 
from 
the 
belief 
that 
the 
present 
League 
constitutes 
a 
complete 
or 
virtually 
complete 
realization 
of 
what 
every 
honest 
and 
sincere 
liberal 
must 
demand. 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
build 
a 
real 
League 
of 
Nations, 
capable 
of 
assuring 
lasting 
peace, 
on 
the 
principle 
that 
the 
traditional, 
historically 
determined 
boundaries 
of 
each 
country 
are 
to 
be 
treated 
as 
inalterably 
fixed. 
The 
League 
of 
Nations 
retains 
the 
fundamental 
defect 
of 
all 
previous 
international 
law: 
in 
setting 
up 
procedural 
rules 
for 
adjudicating 
disputes 
between 
nations, 
it 
is 
not 
in 
the 
least 
interested 
in 
creating 
any 
other 
norms 
for 
their 
settlement 
than 
the 
preservation 
of 
the 
status 
quo 
and 
the 
enforcement 
of 
existing 
treaties. 
Under 
such 
circumstances, 
however, 
peace 
cannot 
be 
assured 
unless 
it 
be 
by 
reducing 
the 
whole 
world 
situation 
to 
a 
state 
of 
frozen 
immobility. 


To 
be 
sure, 
the 
League 
does 
hold 
out, 
even 
though 
very 
cautiously 
and 
with 
many 
reservations, 
the 
prospect 
of 
some 
future 
boundary 
adjustments 
to 
do 
justice 
to 
the 
demands 
of 
some 
nations 
and 
parts 
of 
nations. 
It 
also 
promises—again 
very 
cautiously 
and 
qualifiedly—protection 
to 
national 
minorities. 
This 
permits 
us 
to 
hope 
that 
from 
these 
extremely 
inadequate 
beginnings 
a 
world 
superstate 
really 
deserving 
of 
the 
name 
may 
some 
day 
be 
able 
to 
develop 
that 
would 
be 
capable 
of 
assuring 
the 
nations 
the 
peace 
that 
they 
require. 
But 
this 
question 
will 
not 
be 
decided 
at 
Geneva 
in 
the 
sessions 
of 
the 
present 
League, 
and 
certainly 
not 
in 
the 
parliaments 
of 
the 
individual 
countries 
that 
comprise 
it. 
For 
the 
problem 
involved 
is 
not 
at 
all 
a 
matter 
of 
organization 
or 
of 
the 
technique 
of 
international 
government, 
but 
the 
greatest 
ideological 
question 
that 
mankind 
has 
ever 
faced. 
It 
is 
a 
question 
of 
whether 
we 
shall 
succeed 
in 
creating 
throughout 
the 
world 
a 
frame 
of 
mind 
without 
which 
all 
agreements 
for 
the 
preservation 
of 
peace 
and 
all 
the 
proceedings 
of 



courts 
of 
arbitration 
will 
remain, 
at 
the 
crucial 
moment, 
only 
worthless 
scraps 
of 
paper. 
This 
frame 
of 
mind 
can 
be 
nothing 
less 
than 
the 
unqualified, 
unconditional 
acceptance 
of 
liberalism. 
Liberal 
thinking 
must 
permeate 
all 
nations, 
liberal 
principles 
must 
pervade 
all 
political 
institutions, 
if 
the 
prerequisites 
of 
peace 
are 
to 
be 
created 
and 
the 
causes 
of 
war 
eliminated. 
As 
long 
as 
nations 
cling 
to 
protective 
tariffs, 
immigration 
barriers, 
compulsory 
education, 
interventionism, 
and 
etatism, 
new 
conflicts 
capable 
of 
breaking 
out 
at 
any 
time 
into 
open 
warfare 
will 
continually 
arise 
to 
plague 
mankind. 


11. 
Russia 
The 
law-abiding 
citizen 
by 
his 
labor 
serves 
both 
himself 
and 
his 
fellow 
man 
and 
thereby 
integrates 
himself 
peacefully 
into 
the 
social 
order. 
The 
robber, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
is 
intent, 
not 
on 
honest 
toil, 
but 
on 
the 
forcible 
appropriation 
of 
the 
fruits 
of 
others’ 
labor. 
For 
thousands 
of 
years 
the 
world 
had 
to 
submit 
to 
the 
yoke 
of 
military 
conquerors 
and 
feudal 
lords 
who 
simply 
took 
for 
granted 
that 
the 
products 
of 
the 
industry 
of 
other 
men 
existed 
for 
them 
to 
consume. 
The 
evolution 
of 
mankind 
towards 
civilization 
and 
the 
strengthening 
of 
social 
bonds 
required, 
first 
of 
all, 
overcoming 
the 
intellectual 
and 
physical 
influence 
of 
the 
military 
and 
feudal 
castes 
that 
aspired 
to 
rule 
the 
world 
and 
the 
substitution 
of 
the 
ideal 
of 
the 
bourgeois 
for 
that 
of 
the 
hereditary 
lord. 
The 
supplanting 
of 
the 
militaristic 
ideal, 
which 
esteems 
only 
the 
warrior 
and 
despises 
honest 
labor, 
has 
not, 
by 
any 
means, 
even 
yet 
been 
completely 
achieved. 
In 
every 
nation 
there 
are 
still 
individuals 
whose 
minds 
are 
altogether 
taken 
up 
with 
the 
ideas 
and 
images 
of 
the 
militaristic 
ages. 
There 
are 
nations 
in 
which 
transient 
atavistic 
impulses 
toward 
plunder 
and 
violence, 
which 
one 
would 
have 
presumed 
to 
have 
long 
since 
been 
mastered, 
still 
break 
out 
and 
once 
more 
gain 
ascendancy. 
But, 
by 
and 
large, 
one 
can 
say 
of 
the 
nations 
of 
the 
white 
race 
that 
today 
inhabit 
central 
and 
western 
Europe 
and 
America 
that 
the 
mentality 
that 
Herbert 
Spencer 
called 
“militaristic” 
has 
been 
displaced 
by 
that 
to 
which 
he 
gave 
the 
name 
“industrial.” 
Today 
there 
is 
only 
one 
great 
nation 
that 
steadfastly 
adheres 
to 
the 
militaristic 
ideal, 
viz., 
the 
Russians. 


Of 
course, 
even 
among 
the 
Russian 
people 
there 
are 
some 
who 
do 
not 
share 
this 
attitude. 
It 
is 
only 
to 
be 
regretted 
that 
they 
have 
not 
been 
able 
to 
prevail 
over 
their 
compatriots. 
Ever 
since 
Russia 
was 
first 
in 
a 
position 
to 



exercise 
an 
influence 
on 
European 
politics, 
it 
has 
continually 
behaved 
like 
a 
robber 
who 
lies 
in 
wait 
for 
the 
moment 
when 
he 
can 
pounce 
upon 
his 
victim 
and 
plunder 
him 
of 
his 
possessions. 
At 
no 
time 
did 
the 
Russian 
Czars 
acknowledge 
any 
other 
limits 
to 
the 
expansion 
of 
their 
empire 
than 
those 
dictated 
by 
the 
force 
of 
circumstances. 
The 
position 
of 
the 
Bolsheviks 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
territorial 
expansion 
of 
their 
dominions 
is 
not 
a 
whit 
different. 
They 
too 
acknowledge 
no 
other 
rule 
than 
that, 
in 
the 
conquest 
of 
new 
lands, 
one 
may 
and 
indeed 
must 
go 
as 
far 
as 
one 
dares, 
with 
due 
regard 
to 
one’s 
resources. 
The 
fortunate 
circumstance 
that 
saved 
civilization 
from 
being 
destroyed 
by 
the 
Russians 
was 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
nations 
of 
Europe 
were 
strong 
enough 
to 
be 
able 
successfully 
to 
stand 
off 
the 
onslaught 
of 
the 
hordes 
of 
Russian 
barbarians. 
The 
experiences 
of 
the 
Russians 
in 
the 
Napoleonic 
Wars, 
the 
Crimean 
War, 
and 
the 
Turkish 
campaign 
of 
1877–78 
showed 
them 
that, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
great 
number 
of 
their 
soldiers, 
their 
army 
is 
unable 
to 
seize 
the 
offensive 
against 
Europe. 
The 
World 
War 
merely 
confirmed 
this. 


More 
dangerous 
than 
bayonets 
and 
cannon 
are 
the 
weapons 
of 
the 
mind. 
To 
be 
sure, 
the 
response 
that 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 
Russians 
found 
in 
Europe 
was 
due, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
Europe 
itself 
was 
already 
full 
of 
these 
ideas 
before 
they 
came 
out 
of 
Russia. 
Indeed, 
it 
would 
perhaps 
be 
more 
nearly 
correct 
to 
say 
that 
these 
Russian 
ideas 
themselves 
were 
not 
originally 
Russian, 
however 
much 
they 
may 
have 
suited 
the 
character 
of 
the 
Russian 
people, 
but 
that 
they 
were 
borrowed 
by 
the 
Russians 
from 
Europe. 
So 
great 
is 
the 
intellectual 
sterility 
of 
the 
Russians 
that 
they 
were 
never 
able 
to 
formulate 
for 
themselves 
the 
expression 
of 
their 
own 
inmost 
nature. 


Liberalism, 
which 
is 
based 
completely 
on 
science 
and 
whose 
policies 
represent 
nothing 
but 
the 
application 
of 
the 
results 
of 
science, 
must 
be 
on 
its 
guard 
not 
to 
make 
unscientific 
value 
judgments. 
Value 
judgments 
stand 
outside 
of 
science 
and 
are 
always 
purely 
subjective. 
One 
cannot, 
therefore, 
classify 
nations 
according 
to 
their 
worth 
and 
speak 
of 
them 
as 
worthy 
or 
less 
worthy. 
Consequently, 
the 
question 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
Russians 
are 
inferior 
lies 
completely 
outside 
the 
scope 
of 
our 
consideration. 
We 
do 
not 
at 
all 
contend 
that 
they 
are 
so. 
What 
we 
maintain 
is 
only 
that 
they 
do 
not 
wish 
to 
enter 
into 
the 
scheme 
of 
human 
social 
cooperation. 
In 
relation 
to 
human 
society 
and 
the 
community 
of 
nations 
their 
position 
is 
that 
of 
a 
people 
intent 
on 
nothing 
but 
the 
consumption 
of 
what 
others 
have 
accumulated. 
People 



among 
whom 
the 
ideas 
of 
Dostoyevsky, 
Tolstoy, 
and 
Lenin 
are 
a 
living 
force 
cannot 
produce 
a 
lasting 
social 
organization. 
They 
must 
revert 
to 
a 
condition 
of 
complete 
barbarism. 
Russia 
is 
endowed 
far 
more 
richly 
by 
nature 
with 
fertility 
of 
soil 
and 
mineral 
resources 
of 
all 
kinds 
than 
is 
the 
United 
States. 
If 
the 
Russians 
had 
pursued 
the 
same 
capitalistic 
policy 
as 
the 
Americans, 
they 
would 
today 
be 
the 
richest 
people 
in 
the 
world. 
Despotism, 
imperialism, 
and 
Bolshevism 
have 
made 
them 
the 
poorest. 
Now 
they 
are 
seeking 
capital 
and 
credits 
from 
all 
over 
the 
world. 


Once 
this 
is 
recognized, 
it 
clearly 
follows 
what 
must 
be 
the 
guiding 
principle 
of 
the 
policy 
of 
the 
civilized 
nations 
toward 
Russia. 
Let 
the 
Russians 
be 
Russians. 
Let 
them 
do 
what 
they 
want 
in 
their 
own 
country. 
But 
do 
not 
let 
them 
pass 
beyond 
the 
boundaries 
of 
their 
own 
land 
to 
destroy 
European 
civilization. 
This 
is 
not 
to 
say, 
of 
course, 
that 
the 
importation 
and 
translation 
of 
Russian 
writings 
ought 
to 
be 
prohibited. 
Neurotics 
may 
enjoy 
them 
as 
much 
as 
they 
wish; 
the 
healthy 
will, 
in 
any 
case, 
eschew 
them. 
Nor 
does 
this 
mean 
that 
the 
Russians 
ought 
to 
be 
prohibited 
from 
spreading 
their 
propaganda 
and 
distributing 
bribes 
the 
way 
the 
Czars 
did 
throughout 
the 
world. 
If 
modern 
civilization 
were 
unable 
to 
defend 
itself 
against 
the 
attacks 
of 
hirelings, 
then 
it 
could 
not, 
in 
any 
case, 
remain 
in 
existence 
much 
longer. 
This 
is 
not 
to 
say, 
either, 
that 
Americans 
or 
Europeans 
ought 
to 
be 
prevented 
from 
visiting 
Russia 
if 
they 
are 
attracted 
to 
it. 
Let 
them 
view 
at 
first 
hand, 
at 
their 
own 
risk 
and 
on 
their 
own 
responsibility, 
the 
land 
of 
mass 
murder 
and 
mass 
misery. 
Nor 
does 
this 
mean 
that 
capitalists 
ought 
to 
be 
prevented 
from 
granting 
loans 
to 
the 
Soviets 
or 
otherwise 
to 
invest 
capital 
in 
Russia. 
If 
they 
are 
foolish 
enough 
to 
believe 
that 
they 
will 
ever 
see 
any 
part 
of 
it 
again, 
let 
them 
make 
the 
venture. 


But 
the 
governments 
of 
Europe 
and 
America 
must 
stop 
promoting 
Soviet 
destructionism 
by 
paying 
premiums 
for 
exports 
to 
Soviet 
Russia 
and 
thereby 
furthering 
the 
Russian 
Soviet 
system 
by 
financial 
contributions. 
Let 
them 
stop 
propagandizing 
for 
emigration 
and 
the 
export 
of 
capital 
to 
Soviet 
Russia. 


Whether 
or 
not 
the 
Russian 
people 
are 
to 
discard 
the 
Soviet 
system 
is 
for 
them 
to 
settle 
among 
themselves. 
The 
land 
of 
the 
knout 
and 
the 
prison-camp 
no 
longer 
poses 
a 
threat 
to 
the 
world 
today. 
With 
all 
their 
will 
to 
war 
and 
destruction, 
the 
Russians 
are 
no 
longer 
capable 
seriously 
of 
imperiling 
the 
peace 
of 
Europe. 
One 
may 
therefore 
safely 
let 
them 
alone. 
The 
only 
thing 
that 



needs 
to 
be 
resisted 
is 
any 
tendency 
on 
our 
part 
to 
support 
or 
promote 
the 
destructionist 
policy 
of 
the 
Soviets. 



4 


Liberalism 
and 
the 
Political 
Parties 


1. 
The 
“Doctrinairism” 
of 
the 
Liberals 
Classical 
liberalism 
has 
been 
reproached 
with 
being 
too 
obstinate 
and 
not 
ready 
enough 
to 
compromise. 
It 
was 
because 
of 
its 
inflexibility 
that 
it 
was 
defeated 
in 
its 
struggle 
with 
the 
nascent 
anticapitalist 
parties 
of 
all 
kinds. 
If 
it 
had 
realized, 
as 
these 
other 
parties 
did, 
the 
importance 
of 
compromise 
and 
concession 
to 
popular 
slogans 
in 
winning 
the 
favor 
of 
the 
masses, 
it 
would 
have 
been 
able 
to 
preserve 
at 
least 
some 
of 
its 
influence. 
But 
it 
has 
never 
bothered 
to 
build 
for 
itself 
a 
party 
organization 
and 
a 
party 
machine 
as 
the 
anticapitalist 
parties 
have 
done. 
It 
has 
never 
attached 
any 
importance 
to 
political 
tactics 
in 
electoral 
campaigns 
and 
parliamentary 
proceedings. 
It 
has 
never 
gone 
in 
for 
scheming 
opportunism 
or 
political 
bargaining. 
This 
unyielding 
doctrinairism 
necessarily 
brought 
about 
the 
decline 
of 
liberalism. 


The 
factual 
assertions 
contained 
in 
these 
statements 
are 
entirely 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
truth, 
but 
to 
believe 
that 
they 
constitute 
a 
reproach 
against 
liberalism 
is 
to 
reveal 
a 
complete 
misunderstanding 
of 
its 
essential 
spirit. 
The 
ultimate 
and 
most 
profound 
of 
the 
fundamental 
insights 
of 
liberal 
thought 
is 
that 
it 
is 
ideas 
that 
constitute 
the 
foundation 
on 
which 
the 
whole 
edifice 
of 
human 
social 
cooperation 
is 
constructed 
and 
sustained 
and 
that 
a 
lasting 
social 
structure 
cannot 
be 
built 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
false 
and 
mistaken 
ideas. 
Nothing 
can 
serve 
as 
a 
substitute 
for 
an 
ideology 
that 
enhances 
human 
life 
by 
fostering 
social 
cooperation—least 
of 
all 
lies, 
whether 
they 
be 
called 
“tactics,” 
“diplomacy,” 
or 
“compromise.” 
If 
men 
will 
not, 
from 
a 
recognition 
of 
social 
necessity, 
voluntarily 
do 
what 
must 
be 
done 
if 
society 
is 
to 
be 
maintained 
and 
general 
well-being 
advanced, 
no 
one 
can 
lead 
them 
to 
the 
right 
path 
by 
any 
cunning 
stratagem 
or 
artifice. 
If 
they 
err 
and 
go 
astray, 
then 
one 
must 
endeavor 
to 
enlighten 
them 
by 
instruction. 
But 
if 
they 
cannot 
be 
enlightened, 
if 
they 
persist 
in 
error, 
then 
nothing 
can 
be 
done 
to 
prevent 
catastrophe. 
All 
the 
tricks 
and 
lies 
of 
demagogic 
politicians 
may 
well 
be 



suited 
to 
promote 
the 
cause 
of 
those 
who, 
whether 
in 
good 
faith 
or 
bad, 
work 
for 
the 
destruction 
of 
society. 
But 
the 
cause 
of 
social 
progress, 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
further 
development 
and 
intensification 
of 
social 
bonds, 
cannot 
be 
advanced 
by 
lies 
and 
demagogy. 
No 
power 
on 
earth, 
no 
crafty 
stratagem 
or 
clever 
deception 
could 
succeed 
in 
duping 
mankind 
into 
accepting 
a 
social 
doctrine 
that 
it 
not 
only 
does 
not 
acknowledge, 
but 
openly 
spurns. 


The 
only 
way 
open 
to 
anyone 
who 
wishes 
to 
lead 
the 
world 
back 
to 
liberalism 
is 
to 
convince 
his 
fellow 
citizens 
of 
the 
necessity 
of 
adopting 
the 
liberal 
program. 
This 
work 
of 
enlightenment 
is 
the 
sole 
task 
that 
the 
liberal 
can 
and 
must 
perform 
in 
order 
to 
avert 
as 
much 
as 
lies 
within 
his 
power 
the 
destruction 
toward 
which 
society 
is 
rapidly 
heading 
today. 
There 
is 
no 
place 
here 
for 
concessions 
to 
any 
of 
the 
favorite 
or 
customary 
prejudices 
and 
errors. 
In 
regard 
to 
questions 
that 
will 
decide 
whether 
or 
not 
society 
is 
to 
continue 
to 
exist 
at 
all, 
whether 
millions 
of 
people 
are 
to 
prosper 
or 
perish, 
there 
is 
no 
room 
for 
compromise 
either 
from 
weakness 
or 
from 
misplaced 
deference 
for 
the 
sensibilities 
of 
others. 


If 
liberal 
principles 
once 
again 
are 
allowed 
to 
guide 
the 
policies 
of 
great 
nations, 
if 
a 
revolution 
in 
public 
opinion 
could 
once 
more 
give 
capitalism 
free 
rein, 
the 
world 
will 
be 
able 
gradually 
to 
raise 
itself 
from 
the 
condition 
into 
which 
the 
policies 
of 
the 
combined 
anticapitalist 
factions 
have 
plunged 
it. 
There 
is 
no 
other 
way 
out 
of 
the 
political 
and 
social 
chaos 
of 
the 
present 
age. 


The 
most 
serious 
illusion 
under 
which 
classical 
liberalism 
labored 
was 
its 
optimism 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
direction 
that 
the 
evolution 
of 
society 
was 
bound 
to 
take. 
To 
the 
champions 
of 
liberalism—the 
sociologists 
and 
economists 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
and 
the 
first 
half 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
and 
their 
supporters 
—it 
seemed 
certain 
that 
mankind 
would 
advance 
to 
ever 
higher 
stages 
of 
perfection 
and 
that 
nothing 
would 
be 
able 
to 
arrest 
this 
progress. 
They 
were 
firmly 
convinced 
that 
rational 
cognition 
of 
the 
fundamental 
laws 
of 
social 
cooperation 
and 
interdependence, 
which 
they 
had 
discovered, 
would 
soon 
become 
common 
and 
that 
thereafter 
the 
social 
bonds 
peacefully 
uniting 
mankind 
would 
become 
ever 
closer, 
there 
would 
be 
a 
progressive 
improvement 
in 
general 
well-being, 
and 
civilization 
would 
rise 
to 
ever 
higher 
levels 
of 
culture. 
Nothing 
could 
shake 
their 
optimism. 
As 
the 
attack 
on 
liberalism 
began 
to 
grow 
steadily 
fiercer, 
as 
the 
ascendancy 
of 
liberal 
ideas 
in 
politics 
was 
challenged 
from 
all 
sides, 
they 
thought 
that 
what 
they 
had 
to 
contend 
with 
was 
only 
the 
last 
volleys 
fired 
in 
retreat 
by 
a 
moribund 
system 



that 
did 
not 
require 
serious 
study 
and 
counterattack 
because 
it 
would 
in 
any 
case 
soon 
collapse 
of 
itself. 


The 
liberals 
were 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
all 
men 
have 
the 
intellectual 
capacity 
to 
reason 
correctly 
about 
the 
difficult 
problems 
of 
social 
cooperation 
and 
to 
act 
accordingly. 
They 
were 
so 
impressed 
with 
the 
clarity 
and 
self-
evidence 
of 
the 
reasoning 
by 
which 
they 
had 
arrived 
at 
their 
political 
ideas 
that 
they 
were 
quite 
unable 
to 
understand 
how 
anyone 
could 
fail 
to 
comprehend 
it. 
They 
never 
grasped 
two 
facts: 
first, 
that 
the 
masses 
lack 
the 
capacity 
to 
think 
logically; 
and 
secondly, 
that 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
most 
people, 
even 
when 
they 
are 
able 
to 
recognize 
the 
truth, 
a 
momentary, 
special 
advantage 
that 
may 
be 
enjoyed 
immediately 
appears 
more 
important 
than 
a 
lasting 
greater 
gain 
that 
must 
be 
deferred. 
Most 
people 
do 
not 
have 
even 
the 
intellectual 
endowments 
required 
to 
think 
through 
the—after 
all 
very 
complicated—problems 
of 
social 
cooperation, 
and 
they 
certainly 
do 
not 
have 
the 
will 
power 
necessary 
to 
make 
those 
provisional 
sacrifices 
that 
all 
social 
action 
demands. 
The 
slogans 
of 
interventionism 
and 
of 
socialism, 
especially 
proposals 
for 
the 
partial 
expropriation 
of 
private 
property, 
always 
find 
ready 
and 
enthusiastic 
approval 
with 
the 
masses, 
who 
expect 
to 
profit 
directly 
and 
immediately 
from 
them. 


2. 
Political 
Parties 
There 
can 
be 
no 
more 
grievous 
misunderstanding 
of 
the 
meaning 
and 
nature 
of 
liberalism 
than 
to 
think 
that 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
secure 
the 
victory 
of 
liberal 
ideas 
by 
resorting 
to 
the 
methods 
employed 
today 
by 
the 
other 
political 
parties. 


In 
a 
caste 
and 
status 
society, 
constituted 
not 
of 
citizens 
with 
equal 
rights, 
but 
divided 
into 
ranks 
vested 
with 
different 
duties 
and 
prerogatives, 
there 
are 
no 
political 
parties 
in 
the 
modern 
sense. 
As 
long 
as 
the 
special 
privileges 
and 
immunities 
of 
the 
different 
castes 
are 
not 
called 
into 
question, 
peace 
reigns 
among 
them. 
But 
once 
the 
privileges 
of 
caste 
and 
status 
are 
contested, 
the 
issue 
is 
joined, 
and 
civil 
war 
can 
be 
avoided 
only 
if 
one 
side 
or 
the 
other, 
recognizing 
its 
weakness, 
yields 
without 
an 
appeal 
to 
arms. 
In 
all 
such 
conflicts, 
the 
position 
of 
each 
individual 
is 
determined 
from 
the 
outset 
by 
his 
status 
as 
a 
member 
of 
one 
caste 
or 
another. 
To 
be 
sure, 
there 
can 
be 
renegades 
who, 
in 
the 
expectation 
of 
being 
better 
able 
to 
provide 
for 
their 



personal 
advantage 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
enemy, 
fight 
against 
the 
members 
of 
their 
own 
caste 
and 
are 
consequently 
viewed 
by 
them 
as 
traitors. 
But, 
apart 
from 
such 
exceptional 
cases, 
the 
individual 
is 
not 
confronted 
with 
the 
question 
of 
which 
of 
the 
opposing 
groups 
he 
ought 
to 
join. 
He 
stands 
by 
the 
members 
of 
his 
own 
caste 
and 
shares 
their 
fate. 
The 
caste 
or 
castes 
that 
are 
dissatisfied 
with 
their 
position 
rebel 
against 
the 
prevailing 
order 
and 
have 
to 
win 
their 
demands 
against 
the 
opposition 
of 
the 
others. 
The 
ultimate 
outcome 
of 
the 
conflict 
is—if 
everything 
does 
not, 
in 
fact, 
remain 
as 
it 
was 
because 
the 
rebels 
have 
been 
worsted—that 
the 
old 
order 
is 
replaced 
by 
a 
new 
one 
in 
which 
the 
rights 
of 
the 
various 
castes 
are 
different 
from 
what 
they 
were 
before. 


With 
the 
advent 
of 
liberalism 
came 
the 
demand 
for 
the 
abolition 
of 
all 
special 
privileges. 
The 
society 
of 
caste 
and 
status 
had 
to 
make 
way 
for 
a 
new 
order 
in 
which 
there 
were 
to 
be 
only 
citizens 
with 
equal 
rights. 
What 
was 
under 
attack 
was 
no 
longer 
only 
the 
particular 
privileges 
of 
the 
different 
castes, 
but 
the 
very 
existence 
of 
all 
privileges. 
Liberalism 
tore 
down 
the 
barriers 
of 
rank 
and 
status 
and 
liberated 
man 
from 
the 
restrictions 
with 
which 
the 
old 
order 
had 
surrounded 
him. 
It 
was 
in 
capitalist 
society, 
under 
a 
system 
of 
government 
founded 
on 
liberal 
principles, 
that 
the 
individual 
was 
first 
granted 
the 
opportunity 
to 
participate 
directly 
in 
political 
life 
and 
was 
first 
called 
upon 
to 
make 
a 
personal 
decision 
in 
regard 
to 
political 
goals 
and 
ideals. 
In 
the 
caste 
and 
status 
society 
of 
earlier 
days, 
the 
only 
political 
conflicts 
had 
been 
those 
among 
the 
different 
castes, 
each 
of 
which 
had 
formed 
a 
solid 
front 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
others; 
or, 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
such 
conflicts, 
there 
were, 
within 
those 
castes 
that 
were 
permitted 
a 
share 
in 
political 
life, 
factional 
conflicts 
among 
coteries 
and 
cliques 
for 
influence, 
power, 
and 
a 
place 
at 
the 
helm. 
Only 
under 
a 
polity 
in 
which 
all 
citizens 
enjoy 
equal 
rights—corresponding 
to 
the 
liberal 
ideal, 
which 
has 
nowhere 
ever 
been 
fully 
achieved—can 
there 
be 
political 
parties 
consisting 
of 
associations 
of 
persons 
who 
want 
to 
see 
their 
ideas 
on 
legislation 
and 
administration 
put 
into 
effect. 
For 
there 
can 
very 
well 
be 
differences 
of 
opinion 
concerning 
the 
best 
way 
to 
achieve 
the 
liberal 
aim 
of 
assuring 
peaceful 
social 
cooperation, 
and 
these 
differences 
of 
opinion 
must 
join 
issue 
as 
conflicts 
of 
ideas. 


Thus, 
in 
a 
liberal 
society 
there 
could 
be 
socialist 
parties 
too. 
Even 
parties 
that 
seek 
to 
have 
a 
special 
legal 
position 
conceded 
to 
particular 
groups 



would 
not 
be 
impossible 
under 
a 
liberal 
system. 
But 
all 
these 
parties 
must 
acknowledge 
liberalism 
(at 
least 
temporarily, 
until 
they 
emerge 
victorious) 
so 
far 
as 
to 
make 
use 
in 
their 
political 
struggles 
solely 
of 
the 
weapons 
of 
the 
intellect, 
which 
liberalism 
views 
as 
the 
only 
ones 
permissible 
in 
such 
contests, 
even 
though, 
in 
the 
last 
analysis, 
as 
socialists 
or 
as 
champions 
of 
special 
privileges, 
the 
members 
of 
the 
antiliberal 
parties 
reject 
the 
liberal 
philosophy. 
Thus, 
some 
of 
the 
pre-Marxist 
“utopian” 
socialists 
fought 
for 
socialism 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
liberalism, 
and 
in 
the 
golden 
age 
of 
liberalism 
in 
western 
Europe, 
the 
clergy 
and 
the 
nobility 
tried 
to 
achieve 
their 
ends 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
a 
modern 
constitutional 
state. 


The 
parties 
that 
we 
see 
at 
work 
today 
are 
of 
an 
entirely 
different 
kind. 
To 
be 
sure, 
some 
part 
of 
their 
program 
is 
concerned 
with 
the 
whole 
of 
society 
and 
purports 
to 
address 
itself 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
how 
social 
cooperation 
is 
to 
be 
achieved. 
But 
what 
this 
part 
of 
their 
program 
says 
is 
only 
a 
concession 
wrung 
from 
them 
by 
the 
liberal 
ideology. 
What 
they 
aim 
at 
in 
reality 
is 
set 
forth 
in 
another 
part 
of 
their 
program, 
which 
is 
the 
only 
part 
that 
they 
pay 
any 
attention 
to 
and 
which 
stands 
in 
irreconcilable 
contradiction 
to 
the 
part 
that 
is 
couched 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
general 
welfare. 
Present-day 
political 
parties 
are 
the 
champions 
not 
only 
of 
certain 
of 
the 
privileged 
orders 
of 
earlier 
days 
that 
desire 
to 
see 
preserved 
and 
extended 
traditional 
prerogatives 
that 
liberalism 
had 
to 
allow 
them 
to 
keep 
because 
its 
victory 
was 
not 
complete, 
but 
also 
of 
certain 
groups 
that 
strive 
for 
special 
privileges, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
desire 
to 
attain 
the 
status 
of 
a 
caste. 
Liberalism 
addresses 
itself 
to 
all 
and 
proposes 
a 
program 
acceptable 
to 
all 
alike. 
It 
promises 
no 
one 
privileges. 
By 
calling 
for 
the 
renunciation 
of 
the 
pursuit 
of 
special 
interests, 
it 
even 
demands 
sacrifices, 
though, 
of 
course, 
only 
provisional 
ones, 
involving 
the 
giving 
up 
of 
a 
relatively 
small 
advantage 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
a 
greater 
one. 
But 
the 
parties 
of 
special 
interests 
address 
themselves 
only 
to 
a 
part 
of 
society. 
To 
this 
part, 
for 
which 
alone 
they 
intend 
to 
work, 
they 
promise 
special 
advantages 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
society. 


All 
modern 
political 
parties 
and 
all 
modern 
party 
ideologies 
originated 
as 
a 
reaction 
on 
the 
part 
of 
special 
group 
interests 
fighting 
for 
a 
privileged 
status 
against 
liberalism. 
Before 
the 
rise 
of 
liberalism, 
there 
were, 
of 
course, 
privileged 
orders 
with 
their 
special 
interests 
and 
prerogatives 
and 
their 
mutual 
conflicts, 
but 
at 
that 
time 
the 
ideology 
of 
the 
status 
society 
could 
still 
express 
itself 
in 
a 
completely 
naive 
and 
unembarrassed 
way. 
In 
the 
conflicts 
that 



occurred 
in 
those 
days 
between 
the 
champions 
and 
the 
opponents 
of 
special 
privilege, 
there 
was 
never 
any 
question 
of 
the 
antisocial 
character 
of 
the 
whole 
system 
nor 
any 
need 
of 
maintaining 
the 
pretense 
of 
justifying 
it 
on 
social 
grounds. 
One 
cannot, 
therefore, 
draw 
any 
direct 
comparison 
between 
the 
old 
system 
of 
privileged 
orders 
and 
the 
activities 
and 
propaganda 
of 
the 
present-day 
parties 
of 
special 
interests. 


To 
understand 
the 
true 
character 
of 
all 
these 
parties, 
one 
must 
keep 
in 
mind 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
were 
originally 
formed 
solely 
as 
a 
defense 
of 
special 
privileges 
against 
the 
teachings 
of 
liberalism. 
Their 
party 
doctrines 
are 
not, 
like 
those 
of 
liberalism, 
the 
political 
application 
of 
a 
comprehensive, 
carefully 
thought-out 
theory 
of 
society. 
The 
political 
ideology 
of 
liberalism 
was 
derived 
from 
a 
fundamental 
system 
of 
ideas 
that 
had 
first 
been 
developed 
as 
a 
scientific 
theory 
without 
any 
thought 
of 
its 
political 
significance. 
In 
contradistinction 
to 
this, 
the 
special 
rights 
and 
privileges 
sought 
by 
the 
antiliberal 
parties 
were, 
from 
the 
very 
outset, 
already 
realized 
in 
existing 
social 
institutions, 
and 
it 
was 
in 
justification 
of 
the 
latter 
that 
one 
undertook 
subsequently 
to 
elaborate 
an 
ideology, 
a 
task 
that 
was 
generally 
treated 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
little 
moment 
that 
could 
easily 
be 
disposed 
of 
with 
a 
few 
brief 
words. 
Farm 
groups 
think 
it 
sufficient 
to 
point 
out 
the 
indispensability 
of 
agriculture. 
The 
trade 
unions 
appeal 
to 
the 
indispensability 
of 
labor. 
The 
parties 
of 
the 
middle 
class 
cite 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
social 
stratum 
that 
represents 
the 
golden 
mean. 
It 
seems 
to 
trouble 
them 
little 
that 
such 
appeals 
contribute 
nothing 
to 
proving 
the 
necessity 
or 
even 
the 
advantageousness 
to 
the 
general 
public 
of 
the 
special 
privileges 
they 
are 
striving 
for. 
The 
groups 
that 
they 
desire 
to 
win 
over 
will 
follow 
them 
in 
any 
case, 
and 
as 
for 
the 
others, 
every 
attempt 
at 
recruiting 
supporters 
from 
their 
ranks 
would 
be 
futile. 


Thus, 
all 
these 
modern 
parties 
of 
special 
interests, 
no 
matter 
how 
far 
apart 
their 
goals 
may 
diverge 
or 
how 
violently 
they 
may 
contend 
against 
one 
another, 
form 
a 
united 
front 
in 
the 
battle 
against 
liberalism. 
In 
the 
eyes 
of 
all 
of 
them, 
the 
principle 
of 
liberalism 
that 
the 
rightly 
understood 
interests 
of 
all 
men 
are, 
in 
the 
long 
run, 
compatible 
is 
like 
a 
red 
cloth 
waved 
in 
front 
of 
a 
bull. 
As 
they 
see 
it, 
there 
are 
irreconcilable 
conflicts 
of 
interests 
that 
can 
be 
settled 
only 
by 
the 
victory 
of 
one 
faction 
over 
the 
others, 
to 
the 
advantage 
of 
the 
former 
and 
the 
disadvantage 
of 
the 
latter. 
Liberalism, 
these 
parties 
assert, 
is 
not 
what 
it 
pretends 
to 
be. 
It 
too 
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
party 
program 
seeking 
to 



champion 
the 
special 
interests 
of 
a 
particular 
group, 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
i.e., 
the 
capitalists 
and 
entrepreneurs, 
against 
the 
interests 
of 
all 
other 
groups. 


The 
fact 
that 
this 
allegation 
forms 
part 
of 
the 
propaganda 
of 
Marxism 
accounts 
for 
much 
of 
the 
latter’s 
success. 
If 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
irreconcilable 
conflict 
between 
the 
interests 
of 
different 
classes 
within 
a 
society 
based 
on 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
is 
taken 
as 
the 
essential 
dogma 
of 
Marxism, 
then 
all 
the 
parties 
active 
today 
on 
the 
European 
continent 
would 
have 
to 
be 
considered 
as 
Marxist. 
The 
doctrine 
of 
class 
antagonisms 
and 
of 
class 
conflict 
is 
also 
accepted 
by 
the 
nationalist 
parties 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
share 
the 
opinion 
that 
these 
antagonisms 
do 
exist 
in 
capitalist 
society 
and 
that 
the 
conflicts 
to 
which 
they 
give 
rise 
must 
run 
their 
course. 
What 
distinguishes 
them 
from 
the 
Marxist 
parties 
is 
only 
that 
they 
wish 
to 
overcome 
class 
conflict 
by 
reverting 
to 
a 
status 
society 
constituted 
along 
the 
lines 
that 
they 
recommend 
and 
by 
shifting 
the 
battlefront 
to 
the 
international 
arena, 
where 
they 
believe 
it 
should 
be. 
They 
do 
not 
dispute 
the 
statement 
that 
conflicts 
of 
this 
kind 
occur 
in 
a 
society 
based 
on 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
They 
merely 
contend 
that 
such 
antagonisms 
ought 
not 
to 
arise, 
and 
in 
order 
to 
eliminate 
them, 
they 
want 
to 
guide 
and 
regulate 
private 
property 
by 
acts 
of 
government 
interference; 
they 
want 
interventionism 
in 
place 
of 
capitalism. 
But, 
in 
the 
last 
analysis, 
this 
is 
in 
no 
way 
different 
from 
what 
the 
Marxists 
say. 
They 
too 
promise 
to 
lead 
the 
world 
to 
a 
new 
social 
order 
in 
which 
there 
will 
be 
no 
more 
classes, 
class 
antagonisms, 
or 
class 
conflicts. 


In 
order 
to 
grasp 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
class 
war, 
one 
must 
bear 
in 
mind 
that 
it 
is 
directed 
against 
the 
liberal 
doctrine 
of 
the 
harmony 
of 
the 
rightly 
understood 
interests 
of 
all 
members 
of 
a 
free 
society 
founded 
on 
the 
principle 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
The 
liberals 
maintained 
that 
with 
the 
elimination 
of 
all 
the 
artificial 
distinctions 
of 
caste 
and 
status, 
the 
abolition 
of 
all 
privileges, 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
equality 
before 
the 
law, 
nothing 
else 
stands 
in 
the 
way 
of 
the 
peaceful 
cooperation 
of 
all 
members 
of 
society, 
because 
then 
their 
rightly 
understood, 
long-run 
interests 
coincide. 
All 
the 
objections 
that 
the 
champions 
of 
feudalism, 
of 
special 
privileges, 
and 
of 
distinctions 
of 
caste 
and 
status 
sought 
to 
advance 
against 
this 
doctrine 
soon 
proved 
quite 
unjustified 
and 
were 
unable 
to 
gain 
any 
notable 
support. 
But 
in 
Ricardo’s 
system 
of 
catallactics 
one 
may 
find 
the 
point 
of 
departure 
for 
a 
new 
theory 
of 
the 
conflict 
of 
interests 
within 
the 



capitalist 
system. 
Ricardo 
believed 
that 
he 
could 
show 
how, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
progressive 
economic 
development, 
a 
shift 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
relations 
among 
the 
three 
forms 
of 
income 
in 
his 
system, 
viz., 
profit, 
rent, 
and 
wages. 
It 
was 
this 
that 
impelled 
a 
few 
English 
writers 
in 
the 
third 
and 
fourth 
decades 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
three 
classes 
of 
capitalists, 
landowners, 
and 
wage-laborers 
and 
to 
maintain 
that 
an 
irreconcilable 
antagonism 
exists 
among 
these 
groups. 
This 
line 
of 
thought 
was 
later 
taken 
up 
by 
Marx. 


In 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto, 
Marx 
still 
did 
not 
distinguish 
between 
caste 
and 
class. 
Only 
later, 
when 
he 
became 
acquainted 
in 
London 
with 
the 
writings 
of 
the 
forgotten 
pamphleteers 
of 
the 
twenties 
and 
thirties 
and, 
under 
their 
influence, 
began 
the 
study 
of 
Ricardo’s 
system, 
did 
he 
realize 
that 
the 
problem 
in 
this 
case 
was 
to 
show 
that 
even 
in 
a 
society 
without 
caste 
distinctions 
and 
privileges 
irreconcilable 
conflicts 
still 
exist. 
This 
antagonism 
of 
interests 
he 
deduced 
from 
Ricardo’s 
system 
by 
distinguishing 
among 
the 
three 
classes 
of 
capitalists, 
landowners, 
and 
workers. 
But 
he 
by 
no 
means 
adhered 
firmly 
to 
this 
distinction. 
Sometimes 
he 
asserts 
that 
there 
are 
only 
two 
classes, 
the 
propertied 
and 
the 
propertyless; 
at 
other 
times 
he 
distinguishes 
among 
more 
classes 
than 
just 
the 
two 
or 
three 
great 
ones. 
At 
no 
time, 
however, 
did 
Marx 
or 
any 
one 
of 
his 
many 
followers 
attempt 
in 
any 
way 
to 
define 
the 
concept 
and 
nature 
of 
the 
classes. 
It 
is 
significant 
that 
the 
chapter 
entitled 
“The 
Classes” 
in 
the 
third 
volume 
of 
Capital 
breaks 
off 
after 
a 
few 
sentences. 
More 
than 
a 
generation 
elapsed 
from 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto, 
in 
which 
Marx 
first 
makes 
class 
antagonism 
and 
class 
war 
the 
keystone 
of 
his 
entire 
doctrine, 
to 
the 
time 
of 
his 
death. 
During 
this 
entire 
period 
Marx 
wrote 
volume 
after 
volume, 
but 
he 
never 
came 
to 
the 
point 
of 
explaining 
what 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
by 
a 
“class.” 
In 
his 
treatment 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
classes 
Marx 
never 
went 
beyond 
the 
mere 
statement, 
without 
any 
proof, 
of 
a 
dogma 
or, 
let 
us 
rather 
say, 
of 
a 
slogan. 


In 
order 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
doctrine 
of 
class 
warfare 
is 
true, 
one 
would 
have 
to 
be 
able 
to 
establish 
two 
facts: 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
that 
there 
is 
an 
identity 
of 
interests 
among 
the 
members 
of 
each 
class; 
and, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
that 
what 
benefits 
one 
class 
injures 
the 
other. 
This, 
however, 
has 
never 
been 
accomplished. 
Indeed, 
it 
has 
never 
even 
been 
attempted. 
Precisely 
because 
“class 
comrades” 
are 
all 
in 
the 
same 
“social 
situation,” 
there 
is 
no 
identity 
of 
interests 
among 
them, 
but 
rather 
competition. 
The 
worker, 
for 
example, 
who 
is 
employed 
under 
better-than-average 
conditions 
has 
an 
interest 
in 
excluding 



competitors 
who 
could 
reduce 
his 
income 
to 
the 
average 
level. 
In 
the 
decades 
when 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
international 
solidarity 
of 
the 
proletariat 
was 
proclaimed 
time 
and 
time 
again 
in 
verbose 
resolutions 
adopted 
at 
the 
international 
Marxist 
congresses, 
the 
workers 
of 
the 
United 
States 
and 
Australia 
set 
up 
the 
greatest 
obstacles 
to 
immigration. 
By 
means 
of 
a 
complex 
network 
of 
petty 
regulations, 
the 
English 
trade 
unions 
made 
impossible 
the 
entrance 
of 
outsiders 
into 
their 
branches 
of 
labor. 
What 
has 
been 
done 
by 
the 
labor 
parties 
in 
this 
regard 
in 
every 
country 
during 
the 
last 
few 
years 
is 
well 
known. 
Of 
course, 
one 
can 
say 
that 
this 
ought 
not 
to 
have 
happened; 
the 
workers 
ought 
to 
have 
acted 
differently; 
what 
they 
did 
was 
wrong. 
But 
one 
cannot 
deny 
that 
it 
directly 
served 
their 
interests—at 
least 
for 
the 
moment. 


Liberalism 
has 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
antagonism 
of 
interests, 
which, 
according 
to 
a 
widely 
prevalent 
opinion, 
is 
supposed 
to 
exist 
among 
different 
persons, 
groups, 
and 
strata 
within 
a 
society 
based 
on 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
does 
not, 
in 
fact, 
occur. 
Any 
increase 
in 
total 
capital 
raises 
the 
income 
of 
capitalists 
and 
landowners 
absolutely 
and 
that 
of 
workers 
both 
absolutely 
and 
relatively. 
As 
regards 
their 
income, 
any 
shifts 
in 
the 
various 
interests 
of 
the 
different 
groups 
and 
strata 
of 
society—the 
entrepreneurs, 
capitalists, 
landowners, 
and 
workers—occur 
together 
and 
move 
in 
the 
same 
direction 
as 
they 
pass 
through 
different 
phases 
in 
their 
fluctuations; 
what 
varies 
is 
only 
the 
ratio 
of 
their 
shares 
of 
the 
social 
product. 
The 
interests 
of 
the 
land-owners 
oppose 
those 
of 
the 
members 
of 
the 
other 
groups 
only 
in 
the 
one 
case 
of 
a 
genuine 
monopoly 
of 
a 
certain 
mineral. 
The 
interests 
of 
the 
entrepreneurs 
can 
never 
diverge 
from 
those 
of 
the 
consumers. 
The 
entrepreneur 
prospers 
the 
better, 
the 
better 
he 
is 
able 
to 
anticipate 
the 
desires 
of 
the 
consumers. 


Conflicts 
of 
interests 
can 
occur 
only 
in 
so 
far 
as 
restrictions 
on 
the 
owners’ 
free 
disposal 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
are 
imposed 
by 
the 
interventionist 
policy 
of 
the 
government 
or 
by 
interference 
on 
the 
part 
of 
other 
social 
forces 
armed 
with 
coercive 
power. 
For 
example, 
the 
price 
of 
a 
certain 
article 
can 
be 
artificially 
raised 
by 
a 
protective 
tariff, 
or 
the 
wages 
of 
a 
certain 
group 
of 
workers 
can 
be 
increased 
by 
excluding 
all 
competitors 
for 
their 
jobs. 
The 
famous 
line 
of 
reasoning 
of 
the 
free-trade 
school, 
never 
refuted 
and 
forever 
irrefutable, 
applies 
to 
cases 
of 
this 
kind. 
Such 
special 
privileges 
can, 
of 
course, 
benefit 
the 
particular 
group 
on 
whose 
behalf 
they 
were 
instituted 
only 
if 
other 
groups 
have 
been 
unable 
to 
win 
similar 



privileges 
for 
themselves. 
But 
it 
cannot 
be 
assumed 
that 
it 
would 
be 
possible, 
in 
the 
long 
run, 
to 
deceive 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
people 
about 
the 
real 
significance 
of 
such 
special 
privileges 
so 
that 
they 
will 
tolerate 
them 
willingly. 
Yet 
if 
one 
undertakes 
to 
use 
force 
to 
compel 
their 
acceptance, 
one 
will 
provoke 
violent 
rebellion—in 
short, 
a 
disturbance 
of 
the 
peaceful 
course 
of 
social 
cooperation, 
the 
preservation 
of 
which 
is 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
everyone. 
If 
one 
seeks 
to 
solve 
the 
problem 
by 
making 
these 
special 
privileges, 
not 
exceptions 
on 
behalf 
of 
just 
one 
or 
a 
few 
persons, 
groups, 
or 
strata 
of 
society, 
but 
the 
general 
rule, 
as, 
for 
example, 
by 
resorting 
to 
import 
duties 
to 
protect 
most 
of 
the 
articles 
sold 
on 
the 
home 
market, 
or 
by 
using 
similar 
measures 
to 
bar 
access 
to 
the 
majority 
of 
occupations, 
the 
advantages 
gained 
by 
each 
particular 
group 
are 
counterbalanced 
by 
the 
disadvantages 
that 
they 
must 
suffer, 
and 
the 
end 
result 
is 
only 
that 
all 
are 
injured 
by 
the 
consequent 
lowering 
of 
the 
productivity 
of 
labor. 


If 
one 
rejects 
this 
doctrine 
of 
liberalism, 
if 
one 
heaps 
ridicule 
on 
the 
controversial 
theory 
of 
the 
“harmony 
of 
interests 
of 
all 
men,” 
then 
it 
is 
not 
true, 
either, 
as 
is 
wrongly 
assumed 
by 
all 
schools 
of 
antiliberal 
thought, 
that 
there 
could 
still 
be 
a 
solidarity 
of 
interests 
within 
narrower 
circles, 
as, 
for 
instance, 
among 
members 
of 
the 
same 
nation 
(as 
against 
other 
nations) 
or 
among 
members 
of 
the 
same 
“class” 
(as 
against 
other 
classes). 
In 
order 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
existence 
of 
such 
an 
alleged 
solidarity, 
a 
special 
line 
of 
reasoning 
would 
be 
necessary 
that 
no 
one 
has 
followed 
or 
has 
even 
attempted 
to 
follow. 
For 
all 
the 
arguments 
that 
could 
be 
employed 
to 
prove 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
solidarity 
of 
interests 
among 
the 
members 
of 
any 
of 
these 
groups 
prove 
much 
more 
besides, 
viz., 
the 
universal 
solidarity 
of 
interests 
within 
ecumenical 
society. 
How 
those 
apparent 
conflicts 
of 
interest 
that 
seem 
at 
first 
sight 
to 
be 
irreconcilable 
are 
in 
fact 
resolved 
can 
be 
shown 
only 
by 
means 
of 
a 
line 
of 
reasoning 
that 
treats 
all 
mankind 
as 
an 
essentially 
harmonious 
community 
and 
allows 
no 
room 
for 
the 
demonstration 
of 
any 
irreconcilable 
antagonisms 
among 
nations, 
classes, 
races, 
and 
the 
like. 


The 
antiliberal 
parties 
do 
not, 
as 
they 
believe, 
prove 
that 
there 
is 
any 
solidarity 
of 
interests 
within 
nations, 
classes, 
races, 
etc. 
All 
that 
they 
actually 
do 
is 
to 
recommend 
to 
the 
members 
of 
these 
particular 
groups 
alliances 
for 
a 
common 
struggle 
against 
all 
other 
groups. 
When 
they 
speak 
of 
a 
solidarity 
of 
interests 
within 
these 
groups, 
they 
are 
not 
so 
much 
affirming 
a 
fact 
as 
stating 
a 
postulate. 
In 
reality, 
they 
are 
not 
saying, 
“The 
interests 
are 
identical,” 
but 



rather, 
“The 
interests 
ought 
to 
be 
made 
identical 
by 
an 
alliance 
for 
united 
action.” 


The 
modern 
parties 
of 
special 
interests 
declare 
quite 
frankly 
and 
unequivocally, 
from 
the 
very 
outset, 
that 
the 
aim 
of 
their 
policy 
is 
the 
creation 
of 
special 
privileges 
for 
a 
particular 
group. 
Agrarian 
parties 
strive 
for 
protective 
tariffs 
and 
other 
advantages 
(e.g., 
subsidies) 
for 
farmers; 
civil 
service 
parties 
aim 
at 
securing 
privileges 
for 
bureaucrats; 
regional 
parties 
are 
dedicated 
to 
gaining 
special 
advantages 
for 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
a 
certain 
region. 
All 
these 
parties 
evidently 
seek 
nothing 
but 
the 
advantage 
of 
a 
single 
group 
in 
society, 
without 
consideration 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
society 
or 
of 
all 
other 
groups, 
however 
much 
they 
may 
seek 
to 
palliate 
their 
procedure 
by 
declaring 
that 
the 
welfare 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
society 
can 
be 
achieved 
only 
by 
furthering 
the 
interests 
of 
agriculture, 
the 
civil 
service, 
etc. 
Indeed, 
their 
exclusive 
concern 
with 
but 
a 
single 
segment 
of 
society 
and 
their 
labors 
and 
endeavors 
on 
its 
behalf 
alone 
have 
become 
increasingly 
obvious 
and 
more 
cynical 
with 
the 
passage 
of 
the 
years. 
When 
the 
modern 
antiliberal 
movements 
were 
still 
in 
their 
infancy, 
they 
had 
to 
be 
more 
circumspect 
in 
regard 
to 
such 
matters, 
because 
the 
generation 
that 
had 
been 
reared 
on 
the 
liberal 
philosophy 
had 
learned 
to 
look 
upon 
the 
undisguised 
advocacy 
of 
the 
special 
interests 
of 
various 
groups 
as 
antisocial. 


The 
champions 
of 
special 
interests 
can 
form 
great 
parties 
only 
by 
composing 
a 
single 
combat 
unit 
out 
of 
the 
combined 
forces 
of 
various 
groups 
whose 
special 
interests 
are 
in 
conflict. 
Privileges 
granted 
to 
a 
particular 
group, 
however, 
have 
practical 
value 
only 
when 
they 
accrue 
to 
a 
minority 
and 
are 
not 
outweighed 
by 
the 
privileges 
granted 
to 
another 
group. 
But 
unless 
circumstances 
are 
exceptionally 
favorable, 
a 
small 
group 
cannot 
hope 
at 
present, 
while 
the 
liberal 
condemnation 
of 
the 
privileges 
of 
the 
nobility 
still 
retains 
some 
traces 
of 
its 
earlier 
influence, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
have 
their 
claim 
to 
be 
treated 
as 
a 
privileged 
class 
prevail 
against 
all 
other 
groups. 
The 
problem 
of 
all 
the 
parties 
of 
special 
interests, 
therefore, 
is 
to 
form 
great 
parties 
out 
of 
relatively 
small 
groups 
with 
differing 
and, 
indeed, 
directly 
conflicting 
interests. 
But 
in 
view 
of 
the 
mentality 
that 
leads 
these 
smaller 
parties 
to 
put 
forth 
and 
defend 
their 
demands 
for 
special 
privileges, 
it 
is 
quite 
impracticable 
to 
achieve 
this 
end 
by 
way 
of 
an 
open 
alliance 
among 
the 
various 
groups. 
No 
provisional 
sacrifice 
can 
be 
asked 
of 
the 
man 
who 
strives 
for 
the 
acquisition 
of 
a 
privileged 
position 
for 
his 
own 
group 
or 
even 
for 
himself 
alone; 
if 
he 



were 
capable 
of 
understanding 
the 
reason 
for 
making 
the 
provisional 
sacrifice, 
then 
he 
would 
certainly 
think 
along 
liberal 
lines 
and 
not 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
demands 
of 
those 
engaged 
in 
the 
scramble 
for 
special 
privileges. 
Nor 
can 
one 
openly 
tell 
him 
that 
he 
will 
gain 
more 
from 
the 
privilege 
intended 
for 
him 
than 
he 
will 
lose 
from 
the 
privileges 
that 
he 
will 
have 
to 
concede 
to 
others, 
for 
any 
speeches 
and 
writings 
to 
this 
effect 
could 
not, 
in 
the 
long 
run, 
remain 
hidden 
from 
the 
others 
and 
would 
impel 
them 
to 
raise 
their 
demands 
even 
higher. 


Thus, 
the 
parties 
of 
special 
interests 
are 
obliged 
to 
be 
cautious. 
In 
speaking 
of 
this 
most 
important 
point 
in 
their 
endeavors, 
they 
must 
resort 
to 
ambiguous 
expressions 
intended 
to 
obscure 
the 
true 
state 
of 
affairs. 
Protectionist 
parties 
are 
the 
best 
example 
of 
this 
kind 
of 
equivocation. 
They 
must 
always 
be 
careful 
to 
represent 
the 
interest 
in 
the 
protective 
tariffs 
they 
recommend 
as 
that 
of 
a 
wider 
group. 
When 
associations 
of 
manufacturers 
advocate 
protective 
tariffs, 
the 
party 
leaders 
generally 
take 
care 
not 
to 
mention 
that 
the 
interests 
of 
individual 
groups 
and 
often 
even 
of 
individual 
concerns 
are 
by 
no 
means 
identical 
and 
harmonious. 
The 
weaver 
is 
injured 
by 
tariffs 
on 
machines 
and 
yarn 
and 
will 
promote 
the 
protectionist 
movement 
only 
in 
the 
expectation 
that 
textile 
tariffs 
will 
be 
high 
enough 
to 
compensate 
him 
for 
the 
loss 
that 
he 
suffers 
from 
the 
other 
tariffs. 
The 
farmer 
who 
grows 
fodder 
demands 
tariffs 
on 
fodder, 
which 
the 
cattle 
raisers 
oppose; 
the 
winegrower 
demands 
a 
tariff 
on 
wine, 
which 
is 
just 
as 
disadvantageous 
to 
the 
farmer 
who 
does 
not 
happen 
to 
cultivate 
a 
vineyard 
as 
it 
is 
to 
the 
urban 
consumer. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
protectionists 
appear 
as 
a 
single 
party 
united 
behind 
a 
common 
program. 
This 
is 
made 
possible 
only 
by 
throwing 
a 
veil 
of 
obscurity 
over 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
matter. 


Any 
attempt 
to 
found 
a 
party 
of 
special 
interests 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
an 
equal 
apportionment 
of 
privileges 
among 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
population 
would 
be 
utterly 
senseless. 
A 
privilege 
accruing 
to 
the 
majority 
ceases 
to 
be 
such. 
In 
a 
predominantly 
agricultural 
country, 
which 
exports 
farm 
products, 
an 
agrarian 
party 
working 
for 
special 
favors 
for 
farmers 
would 
be, 
in 
the 
long 
run, 
impossible. 
What 
should 
it 
demand? 
Protective 
tariffs 
could 
not 
benefit 
these 
farmers, 
who 
must 
export; 
and 
subsidies 
could 
not 
be 
paid 
to 
the 
majority 
of 
producers, 
because 
the 
minority 
could 
not 
provide 
them. 
The 
minority, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
which 
demands 
privileges 
for 
itself 
must 
induce 
the 
illusion 
that 
great 
masses 
stand 
behind 
it. 
When 
the 
agrarian 
parties 
in 
the 
industrial 



countries 
present 
their 
demands, 
they 
include 
in 
what 
they 
call 
the 
“farm 
population” 
landless 
workers, 
cottagers, 
and 
owners 
of 
small 
plots 
of 
land, 
who 
have 
no 
interest 
in 
a 
protective 
tariff 
on 
agricultural 
products. 
When 
the 
labor 
parties 
make 
some 
demand 
on 
behalf 
of 
a 
group 
of 
workers, 
they 
always 
talk 
of 
the 
great 
mass 
of 
the 
working 
people 
and 
gloss 
over 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
interests 
of 
trade-unionists 
employed 
in 
different 
branches 
of 
production 
are 
not 
identical, 
but, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
actually 
antagonistic, 
and 
that 
even 
within 
individual 
industries 
and 
concerns 
there 
are 
sharp 
conflicts 
of 
interest. 


This 
is 
one 
of 
the 
two 
fundamental 
weaknesses 
of 
all 
parties 
aiming 
at 
privileges 
on 
behalf 
of 
special 
interests. 
On 
the 
one 
hand, 
they 
are 
obliged 
to 
rely 
on 
only 
a 
small 
group, 
because 
privileges 
cease 
to 
be 
privileges 
when 
they 
are 
granted 
to 
the 
majority; 
but, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
is 
only 
in 
their 
guise 
as 
the 
champions 
and 
representatives 
of 
the 
majority 
that 
they 
have 
any 
prospect 
of 
realizing 
their 
demands. 
The 
fact 
that 
many 
parties 
in 
different 
countries 
have 
sometimes 
succeeded 
in 
overcoming 
this 
difficulty 
in 
carrying 
on 
their 
propaganda 
and 
have 
managed 
to 
imbue 
each 
social 
stratum 
or 
group 
with 
the 
conviction 
that 
its 
members 
may 
expect 
special 
advantages 
from 
the 
triumph 
of 
the 
party 
speaks 
only 
for 
the 
diplomatic 
and 
tactical 
skill 
of 
the 
leadership 
and 
for 
the 
want 
of 
judgment 
and 
the 
political 
immaturity 
of 
the 
voting 
masses. 
It 
by 
no 
means 
proves 
that 
a 
real 
solution 
of 
the 
problem 
is, 
in 
fact, 
possible. 
Of 
course, 
one 
can 
simultaneously 
promise 
city-dwellers 
cheaper 
bread 
and 
farmers 
higher 
prices 
for 
grain, 
but 
one 
cannot 
keep 
both 
promises 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
It 
is 
easy 
enough 
to 
promise 
one 
group 
that 
one 
will 
support 
an 
increase 
in 
certain 
government 
expenditures 
without 
a 
corresponding 
reduction 
in 
other 
government 
expenditures, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
hold 
out 
to 
another 
group 
the 
prospect 
of 
lower 
taxes; 
but 
one 
cannot 
keep 
both 
these 
promises 
at 
the 
same 
time 
either. 
The 
technique 
of 
these 
parties 
is 
based 
on 
the 
division 
of 
society 
into 
producers 
and 
consumers. 
They 
are 
also 
wont 
to 
make 
use 
of 
the 
usual 
hypostasis 
of 
the 
state 
in 
questions 
of 
fiscal 
policy 
that 
enables 
them 
to 
advocate 
new 
expenditures 
to 
be 
paid 
out 
of 
the 
public 
treasury 
without 
any 
particular 
concern 
on 
their 
part 
over 
how 
such 
expenses 
are 
to 
be 
defrayed, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
to 
complain 
about 
the 
heavy 
burden 
of 
taxes. 


The 
other 
basic 
defect 
of 
these 
parties 
is 
that 
the 
demands 
they 
raise 
for 
each 
particular 
group 
are 
limitless. 
There 
is, 
in 
their 
eyes, 
only 
one 
limit 
to 



the 
quantity 
to 
be 
demanded: 
the 
resistance 
put 
up 
by 
the 
other 
side. 
This 
is 
entirely 
in 
keeping 
with 
their 
character 
as 
parties 
striving 
for 
privileges 
on 
behalf 
of 
special 
interests. 
Yet 
parties 
that 
follow 
no 
definite 
program, 
but 
come 
into 
conflict 
in 
the 
pursuit 
of 
unlimited 
desires 
for 
privileges 
on 
behalf 
of 
some 
and 
for 
legal 
disabilities 
for 
others, 
must 
bring 
about 
the 
destruction 
of 
every 
political 
system. 
People 
have 
been 
coming 
to 
recognize 
this 
ever 
more 
clearly 
and 
have 
begun 
to 
speak 
of 
a 
crisis 
of 
the 
modern 
state 
and 
of 
a 
crisis 
of 
the 
parliamentary 
system. 
In 
reality, 
what 
is 
involved 
is 
a 
crisis 
of 
the 
ideologies 
of 
the 
modern 
parties 
of 
special 
interests. 


3. 
The 
Crisis 
of 
Parliamentarism 
and 
the 
Idea 
of 
a 
Diet 
Representing 
Special 
Groups 
Parliamentarism, 
as 
it 
has 
slowly 
developed 
in 
England 
and 
in 
some 
of 
her 
colonies 
since 
the 
seventeenth 
century, 
and 
on 
the 
European 
continent 
since 
the 
overthrow 
of 
Napoleon 
and 
the 
July 
and 
February 
Revolutions, 
presupposes 
the 
general 
acceptance 
of 
the 
ideology 
of 
liberalism. 
All 
who 
enter 
a 
parliament 
charged 
with 
the 
responsibility 
of 
there 
deciding 
how 
the 
country 
shall 
be 
governed 
must 
be 
imbued 
with 
the 
conviction 
that 
the 
rightly 
understood 
interests 
of 
all 
parts 
and 
members 
of 
society 
coincide 
and 
that 
every 
kind 
of 
special 
privilege 
for 
particular 
groups 
and 
classes 
of 
the 
population 
is 
detrimental 
to 
the 
common 
good 
and 
must 
be 
eliminated. 
The 
different 
parties 
in 
a 
parliament 
empowered 
to 
perform 
the 
functions 
assigned 
to 
it 
by 
all 
the 
constitutions 
of 
recent 
times 
may, 
of 
course, 
take 
different 
sides 
in 
regard 
to 
particular 
political 
questions, 
but 
they 
must 
consider 
themselves 
as 
the 
representatives 
of 
the 
whole 
nation, 
not 
as 
representatives 
of 
particular 
districts 
or 
social 
strata. 
Above 
all 
their 
differences 
of 
opinion 
there 
must 
prevail 
the 
conviction 
that, 
in 
the 
last 
analysis, 
they 
are 
united 
by 
a 
common 
purpose 
and 
an 
identical 
aim 
and 
that 
only 
the 
means 
to 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
goal 
toward 
which 
they 
all 
aspire 
are 
in 
dispute. 
The 
parties 
are 
not 
separated 
by 
an 
unbridgeable 
gulf 
nor 
by 
conflicts 
of 
interests 
that 
they 
are 
prepared 
to 
carry 
on 
to 
the 
bitter 
end 
even 
if 
this 
means 
that 
the 
whole 
nation 
must 
suffer 
and 
the 
country 
be 
brought 
to 
ruin. 
What 
divides 
the 
parties 
is 
the 
position 
they 
take 
in 
regard 
to 
concrete 
problems 
of 
policy. 
There 
are, 
therefore, 
only 
two 
parties: 
the 
party 
in 
power 
and 
the 
one 
that 



wants 
to 
be 
in 
power. 
Even 
the 
opposition 
does 
not 
seek 
to 
obtain 
power 
in 
order 
to 
promote 
certain 
interests 
or 
to 
fill 
official 
posts 
with 
its 
party 
members, 
but 
in 
order 
to 
translate 
its 
ideas 
into 
legislation 
and 
to 
put 
them 
into 
effect 
in 
the 
administration 
of 
the 
country. 


Only 
under 
these 
conditions 
are 
parliaments 
or 
parliamentary 
governments 
practicable. 
For 
a 
time 
they 
were 
realized 
in 
the 
Anglo-Saxon 
countries, 
and 
some 
traces 
of 
them 
can 
still 
be 
found 
there 
today. 
On 
the 
European 
continent, 
even 
during 
the 
period 
usually 
characterized 
as 
the 
golden 
age 
of 
liberalism, 
one 
could 
really 
speak 
only 
of 
a 
certain 
approximation 
to 
these 
conditions. 
For 
decades 
now, 
conditions 
in 
the 
popular 
assemblies 
of 
Europe 
have 
been 
something 
like 
their 
direct 
opposite. 
There 
are 
a 
great 
number 
of 
parties, 
and 
each 
particular 
party 
is 
itself 
divided 
into 
various 
subgroups, 
which 
generally 
present 
a 
united 
front 
to 
the 
outside 
world, 
but 
usually 
oppose 
one 
another 
within 
the 
party 
councils 
as 
vehemently 
as 
they 
oppose 
the 
other 
parties 
publicly. 
Each 
particular 
party 
and 
faction 
feels 
itself 
appointed 
to 
be 
the 
sole 
champion 
of 
certain 
special 
interests, 
which 
it 
undertakes 
to 
lead 
to 
victory 
at 
any 
cost. 
To 
allot 
as 
much 
as 
possible 
from 
the 
public 
coffers 
to 
“our 
own,” 
to 
favor 
them 
by 
protective 
tariffs, 
immigration 
barriers, 
“social 
legislation,” 
and 
privileges 
of 
all 
kinds, 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
society, 
is 
the 
whole 
sum 
and 
substance 
of 
their 
policy. 


As 
their 
demands 
are, 
in 
principle, 
limitless, 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
any 
one 
of 
these 
parties 
ever 
to 
achieve 
all 
the 
ends 
it 
envisages. 
It 
is 
unthinkable 
that 
what 
the 
agrarian 
or 
labor 
parties 
strive 
for 
could 
ever 
be 
entirely 
realized. 
Every 
party 
seeks, 
nevertheless, 
to 
attain 
to 
such 
influence 
as 
will 
permit 
it 
to 
satisfy 
its 
desires 
as 
far 
as 
possible, 
while 
also 
taking 
care 
always 
to 
be 
able 
to 
justify 
to 
its 
electors 
why 
all 
their 
wishes 
could 
not 
be 
fulfilled. 
This 
can 
be 
done 
either 
by 
seeking 
to 
give 
in 
public 
the 
appearance 
of 
being 
in 
the 
opposition, 
although 
the 
party 
is 
actually 
in 
power, 
or 
by 
striving 
to 
shift 
the 
blame 
to 
some 
force 
not 
answerable 
to 
its 
influence: 
the 
sovereign, 
in 
the 
monarchical 
state; 
or, 
under 
certain 
circumstances, 
foreign 
powers 
or 
the 
like. 
The 
Bolsheviks 
cannot 
make 
Russia 
happy 
nor 
the 
socialists 
Austria 
because 
“western 
capitalism” 
prevents 
it. 
For 
at 
least 
fifty 
years 
antiliberal 
parties 
have 
ruled 
in 
Germany 
and 
Austria, 
yet 
we 
still 
read 
in 
their 
manifestoes 
and 
public 
statements, 
even 
in 
those 
of 
their 
“scientific” 
champions, 
that 
all 
existing 
evils 
are 
to 
be 
blamed 
on 
the 
dominance 
of 
“liberal” 
principles. 



A 
parliament 
composed 
of 
the 
supporters 
of 
the 
antiliberal 
parties 
of 
special 
interests 
is 
not 
capable 
of 
carrying 
on 
its 
business 
and 
must, 
in 
the 
long 
run, 
disappoint 
everyone. 
This 
is 
what 
people 
mean 
today 
and 
have 
meant 
for 
many 
years 
now 
when 
they 
speak 
of 
the 
crisis 
of 
parliamentarism. 


As 
the 
solution 
for 
this 
crisis, 
some 
demand 
the 
abolition 
of 
democracy 
and 
the 
parliamentary 
system 
and 
the 
institution 
of 
a 
dictatorship. 
We 
do 
not 
propose 
to 
discuss 
once 
again 
the 
objections 
to 
dictatorship. 
This 
we 
have 
already 
done 
in 
sufficient 
detail. 


A 
second 
suggestion 
is 
directed 
toward 
remedying 
the 
alleged 
deficiencies 
of 
a 
general 
assembly 
composed 
of 
members 
elected 
directly 
by 
all 
the 
citizens, 
by 
either 
supplementing 
or 
replacing 
it 
altogether 
with 
a 
diet 
composed 
of 
delegates 
chosen 
by 
autonomous 
corporative 
bodies 
or 
guilds 
formed 
by 
the 
different 
branches 
of 
trade, 
industry, 
and 
the 
professions. 
The 
members 
of 
a 
general 
popular 
assembly, 
it 
is 
said, 
lack 
the 
requisite 
objectivity 
and 
the 
knowledge 
of 
economic 
affairs. 
What 
is 
needed 
is 
not 
so 
much 
a 
general 
policy 
as 
an 
economic 
policy. 
The 
representatives 
of 
industrial 
and 
professional 
guilds 
would 
be 
able 
to 
come 
to 
an 
agreement 
on 
questions 
whose 
solution 
either 
eludes 
entirely 
the 
delegates 
of 
constituencies 
formed 
on 
a 
merely 
geographical 
basis 
or 
becomes 
apparent 
to 
them 
only 
after 
long 
delay. 


In 
regard 
to 
an 
assembly 
composed 
of 
delegates 
representing 
different 
occupational 
associations, 
the 
crucial 
question 
about 
which 
one 
must 
be 
clear 
is 
how 
a 
vote 
is 
to 
be 
taken, 
or, 
if 
each 
member 
is 
to 
have 
one 
vote, 
how 
many 
representatives 
are 
to 
be 
granted 
to 
each 
guild. 
This 
is 
a 
problem 
that 
must 
be 
resolved 
before 
the 
diet 
convenes; 
but 
once 
this 
question 
is 
settled, 
one 
can 
spare 
oneself 
the 
trouble 
of 
calling 
the 
assembly 
into 
session, 
for 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
voting 
is 
thereby 
already 
determined. 
To 
be 
sure, 
it 
is 
quite 
another 
question 
whether 
the 
distribution 
of 
power 
among 
the 
guilds, 
once 
established, 
can 
be 
maintained. 
It 
will 
always 
be—let 
us 
not 
cherish 
any 
delusions 
on 
this 
score—unacceptable 
to 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
people. 
In 
order 
to 
create 
a 
parliament 
acceptable 
to 
the 
majority, 
there 
is 
no 
need 
of 
an 
assembly 
divided 
along 
occupational 
lines. 
Everything 
will 
depend 
on 
whether 
the 
discontent 
aroused 
by 
the 
policies 
adopted 
by 
the 
deputies 
of 
the 
guilds 
is 
great 
enough 
to 
lead 
to 
the 
violent 
overthrow 
of 
the 
whole 
system. 
In 
contrast 
to 
the 
democratic 
system, 
this 
one 
offers 
no 
guarantee 
that 
a 
change 
in 
policy 
desired 
by 
the 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
the 
population 
will 



take 
place. 
In 
saying 
this, 
we 
have 
said 
everything 
that 
needs 
to 
be 
said 
against 
the 
idea 
of 
an 
assembly 
constituted 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
occupational 
divisions. 
For 
the 
liberal, 
any 
system 
which 
does 
not 
exclude 
every 
violent 
interruption 
of 
peaceful 
development 
is, 
from 
the 
very 
outset, 
out 
of 
the 
question. 


Many 
supporters 
of 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
diet 
composed 
of 
guild 
representatives 
think 
that 
conflicts 
should 
be 
settled, 
not 
by 
the 
submission 
of 
one 
faction 
to 
another, 
but 
by 
the 
mutual 
adjustment 
of 
differences. 
But 
what 
is 
supposed 
to 
happen 
if 
the 
parties 
cannot 
succeed 
in 
reaching 
agreement? 
Compromises 
come 
about 
only 
when 
the 
threatening 
spectre 
of 
an 
unfavorable 
issue 
induces 
each 
party 
to 
the 
dispute 
to 
make 
some 
concession. 
No 
one 
prevents 
the 
different 
parties 
from 
coming 
to 
an 
agreement 
even 
in 
a 
parliament 
composed 
of 
delegates 
elected 
directly 
by 
the 
whole 
nation. 
No 
one 
will 
be 
able 
to 
compel 
agreement 
in 
a 
diet 
consisting 
of 
deputies 
chosen 
by 
the 
members 
of 
occupational 
associations. 


Thus, 
an 
assembly 
so 
constituted 
cannot 
function 
like 
a 
parliament 
that 
serves 
as 
the 
organ 
of 
a 
democratic 
system. 
It 
cannot 
be 
the 
place 
where 
differences 
of 
political 
opinion 
are 
peacefully 
adjusted. 
It 
is 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
prevent 
the 
violent 
interruption 
of 
the 
peaceful 
progress 
of 
society 
by 
insurrection, 
revolution, 
and 
civil 
war. 
For 
the 
crucial 
decisions 
that 
determine 
the 
distribution 
of 
political 
power 
in 
the 
state 
are 
not 
made 
within 
its 
chambers 
or 
during 
the 
elections 
that 
decide 
its 
composition. 
The 
decisive 
factor 
in 
determining 
the 
distribution 
of 
power 
is 
the 
relative 
weight 
assigned 
by 
the 
constitution 
to 
the 
different 
corporate 
associations 
in 
the 
shaping 
of 
public 
policy. 
But 
this 
is 
a 
matter 
that 
is 
decided 
outside 
the 
chambers 
of 
the 
diet 
and 
without 
any 
organic 
relationship 
to 
the 
elections 
by 
which 
its 
members 
are 
chosen. 


It 
is 
therefore 
quite 
correct 
to 
withhold 
the 
name 
“parliament” 
from 
an 
assembly 
consisting 
of 
representatives 
of 
corporate 
associations 
organized 
along 
occupational 
lines. 
Political 
terminology 
has 
been 
accustomed, 
in 
the 
last 
two 
centuries, 
to 
make 
a 
sharp 
distinction 
between 
a 
parliament 
and 
such 
an 
assembly. 
If 
one 
does 
not 
wish 
to 
confound 
all 
the 
concepts 
of 
political 
science, 
one 
does 
well 
to 
adhere 
to 
this 
distinction. 


Sidney 
and 
Beatrice 
Webb, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
number 
of 
syndicalists 
and 
guild 
socialists, 
following 
in 
this 
respect 
recommendations 
already 
made 
in 
earlier 
days 
by 
many 
continental 
advocates 
of 
a 
reform 
in 
the 
upper 
chamber, 
have 



proposed 
letting 
two 
chambers 
exist 
side 
by 
side, 
one 
elected 
directly 
by 
the 
whole 
nation, 
and 
the 
other 
composed 
of 
deputies 
elected 
from 
constituencies 
divided 
along 
occupational 
lines. 
However, 
it 
is 
obvious 
that 
this 
suggestion 
in 
no 
way 
remedies 
the 
defects 
of 
the 
system 
of 
guild 
representation. 
In 
practice, 
the 
bicameral 
system 
can 
function 
only 
if 
one 
house 
has 
the 
upper 
hand 
and 
has 
the 
unconditional 
power 
to 
impose 
its 
will 
on 
the 
other, 
or 
if, 
when 
the 
two 
chambers 
take 
different 
positions 
on 
an 
issue, 
an 
attempt 
at 
a 
compromise 
solution 
must 
be 
made. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
such 
an 
attempt, 
however, 
the 
conflict 
remains 
to 
be 
settled 
outside 
the 
chambers 
of 
parliament, 
in 
the 
last 
resort 
by 
force 
alone. 
Twist 
and 
turn 
the 
problem 
as 
one 
will, 
one 
always 
returns 
in 
the 
end 
to 
the 
same 
insurmountable 
difficulties. 
Such 
are 
the 
stumbling 
blocks 
on 
which 
all 
proposals 
of 
this 
and 
a 
similar 
kind 
must 
come 
to 
grief, 
whether 
they 
are 
called 
corporativism, 
guild 
socialism, 
or 
anything 
else. 
The 
impracticability 
of 
these 
schemes 
is 
admitted 
when 
people 
finally 
content 
themselves 
by 
recommending 
a 
completely 
inconsequential 
innovation: 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
economic 
council 
empowered 
to 
serve 
solely 
in 
an 
advisory 
capacity. 


The 
champions 
of 
the 
idea 
of 
an 
assembly 
composed 
of 
guild 
deputies 
labor 
under 
a 
serious 
delusion 
if 
they 
think 
that 
the 
antagonisms 
that 
today 
rend 
the 
fabric 
of 
national 
unity 
can 
be 
overcome 
by 
dividing 
the 
population 
and 
the 
popular 
assembly 
along 
occupational 
lines. 
One 
cannot 
get 
rid 
of 
these 
antagonisms 
by 
tinkering 
with 
technicalities 
in 
the 
constitution. 
They 
can 
be 
overcome 
only 
by 
the 
liberal 
ideology. 


4. 
Liberalism 
and 
the 
Parties 
of 
Special 
Interests 
The 
parties 
of 
special 
interests, 
which 
see 
nothing 
more 
in 
politics 
than 
the 
securing 
of 
privileges 
and 
prerogatives 
for 
their 
own 
groups, 
not 
only 
make 
the 
parliamentary 
system 
impossible; 
they 
rupture 
the 
unity 
of 
the 
state 
and 
of 
society. 
They 
lead 
not 
merely 
to 
the 
crisis 
of 
parliamentarism, 
but 
to 
a 
general 
political 
and 
social 
crisis. 
Society 
cannot, 
in 
the 
long 
run, 
exist 
if 
it 
is 
divided 
into 
sharply 
defined 
groups, 
each 
intent 
on 
wresting 
special 
privileges 
for 
its 
own 
members, 
continually 
on 
the 
alert 
to 
see 
that 
it 
does 
not 
suffer 
any 
setback, 
and 
prepared, 
at 
any 
moment, 
to 
sacrifice 
the 
most 
important 
political 
institutions 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
winning 
some 
petty 
advantage. 


To 
the 
parties 
of 
special 
interests, 
all 
political 
questions 
appear 



exclusively 
as 
problems 
of 
political 
tactics. 
Their 
ultimate 
goal 
is 
fixed 
for 
them 
from 
the 
start. 
Their 
aim 
is 
to 
obtain, 
at 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
population, 
the 
greatest 
possible 
advantages 
and 
privileges 
for 
the 
groups 
they 
represent. 
The 
party 
platform 
is 
intended 
to 
disguise 
this 
objective 
and 
give 
it 
a 
certain 
appearance 
of 
justification, 
but 
under 
no 
circumstances 
to 
announce 
it 
publicly 
as 
the 
goal 
of 
party 
policy. 
The 
members 
of 
the 
party, 
in 
any 
case, 
know 
what 
their 
goal 
is; 
they 
do 
not 
need 
to 
have 
it 
explained 
to 
them. 
How 
much 
of 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
imparted 
to 
the 
world 
is, 
however, 
a 
purely 
tactical 
question. 


All 
antiliberal 
parties 
want 
nothing 
but 
to 
secure 
special 
favors 
for 
their 
own 
members, 
in 
complete 
disregard 
of 
the 
resulting 
disintegration 
of 
the 
whole 
structure 
of 
society. 
They 
cannot 
withstand 
for 
a 
moment 
the 
criticism 
that 
liberalism 
makes 
of 
their 
aims. 
They 
cannot 
deny, 
when 
their 
demands 
are 
subjected 
to 
the 
test 
of 
logical 
scrutiny, 
that 
their 
activity, 
in 
the 
last 
analysis, 
has 
antisocial 
and 
destructive 
effects 
and 
that 
even 
on 
the 
most 
cursory 
examination 
it 
must 
prove 
impossible 
for 
any 
social 
order 
to 
arise 
from 
the 
operations 
of 
parties 
of 
special 
interests 
continually 
working 
against 
one 
another. 
To 
be 
sure, 
the 
obviousness 
of 
these 
facts 
has 
not 
been 
able 
to 
damage 
the 
parties 
of 
special 
interests 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
those 
who 
lack 
the 
capacity 
to 
look 
beyond 
the 
immediate 
present. 
The 
great 
mass 
of 
people 
do 
not 
inquire 
what 
will 
happen 
the 
day 
after 
tomorrow 
or 
later 
on. 
They 
think 
of 
today 
and, 
at 
most, 
of 
the 
next 
day. 
They 
do 
not 
ask 
what 
must 
follow 
if 
all 
other 
groups 
too, 
in 
the 
pursuit 
of 
their 
special 
interests, 
were 
to 
display 
the 
same 
unconcern 
for 
the 
general 
welfare. 
They 
hope 
to 
succeed 
not 
only 
in 
realizing 
their 
own 
demands, 
but 
also 
in 
beating 
down 
those 
of 
others. 
For 
the 
few 
who 
apply 
higher 
standards 
to 
the 
activities 
of 
political 
parties, 
who 
demand 
that 
even 
in 
political 
action 
the 
categorical 
imperative 
be 
followed 
(“Act 
only 
on 
that 
principle 
which 
you 
can 
will 
at 
the 
same 
time 
to 
be 
a 
universal 
law, 
i.e., 
so 
that 
no 
contradiction 
results 
from 
the 
attempt 
to 
conceive 
of 
your 
action 
as 
a 
law 
to 
be 
universally 
complied 
with”), 
the 
ideology 
of 
the 
parties 
of 
special 
interests 
certainly 
has 
nothing 
to 
offer. 


Socialism 
has 
gained 
a 
considerable 
advantage 
from 
this 
logical 
deficiency 
in 
the 
position 
adopted 
by 
the 
parties 
of 
special 
interests. 
For 
many 
who 
are 
unable 
to 
grasp 
the 
great 
ideal 
of 
liberalism, 
but 
who 
think 
too 
clearly 
to 
be 
content 
with 
demands 
for 
privileged 
treatment 
on 
behalf 
of 
particular 
groups, 
the 
principle 
of 
socialism 
took 
on 
a 
special 
significance. 



The 
idea 
of 
a 
socialist 
society—to 
which 
one 
cannot, 
in 
spite 
of 
its 
necessarily 
inherent 
defects, 
which 
we 
have 
already 
discussed 
in 
detail, 
deny 
a 
certain 
grandeur 
of 
conception—served 
to 
conceal 
and, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
to 
vindicate 
the 
weakness 
of 
the 
position 
taken 
by 
the 
parties 
of 
special 
interests. 
It 
had 
the 
effect 
of 
diverting 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
critic 
from 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
party 
to 
a 
great 
problem, 
which, 
whatever 
one 
may 
think 
of 
it, 
was 
at 
all 
events 
deserving 
of 
serious 
and 
exhaustive 
consideration. 


In 
the 
last 
hundred 
years, 
the 
socialist 
ideal, 
in 
one 
form 
or 
another, 
has 
found 
adherents 
among 
many 
sincere 
and 
honest 
people. 
A 
number 
of 
the 
best 
and 
noblest 
men 
and 
women 
have 
accepted 
it 
with 
enthusiasm. 
It 
has 
been 
the 
guiding 
star 
of 
distinguished 
statesmen. 
It 
has 
achieved 
a 
dominant 
position 
at 
the 
universities 
and 
has 
served 
as 
a 
source 
of 
inspiration 
to 
youth. 
It 
has 
so 
filled 
the 
thoughts 
and 
fed 
the 
emotions 
of 
both 
the 
past 
and 
the 
present 
generation 
that 
history 
will 
some 
day 
quite 
justly 
characterize 
our 
era 
as 
the 
age 
of 
socialism. 
In 
the 
last 
decades, 
in 
all 
countries 
people 
have 
done 
as 
much 
as 
they 
could 
to 
make 
the 
socialist 
ideal 
a 
reality 
by 
nationalizing 
and 
municipalizing 
enterprises 
and 
by 
adopting 
measures 
designed 
to 
lead 
to 
a 
planned 
economy. 
The 
defects 
necessarily 
involved 
in 
socialist 
management—its 
unfavorable 
effects 
on 
the 
productivity 
of 
human 
labor 
and 
the 
impossibility 
of 
economic 
calculation 
under 
socialism—everywhere 
brought 
these 
endeavors 
to 
the 
point 
where 
virtually 
every 
step 
further 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
socialism 
threatened 
too 
flagrant 
an 
impairment 
of 
the 
supply 
of 
goods 
available 
to 
the 
public. 
From 
sheer 
necessity 
one 
had 
to 
pause 
on 
the 
road 
to 
socialism; 
and 
the 
socialist 
ideal—even 
while 
preserving 
its 
ideological 
ascendancy—became, 
in 
practical 
politics, 
merely 
a 
cloak 
for 
the 
labor 
parties 
in 
their 
scramble 
for 
privileges. 


This 
could 
be 
shown 
to 
be 
true 
of 
each 
of 
the 
many 
socialist 
parties, 
such 
as, 
for 
instance, 
the 
various 
factions 
among 
the 
Christian 
socialists. 
We 
propose, 
however, 
to 
confine 
our 
discussion 
to 
the 
case 
of 
the 
Marxian 
socialists, 
who 
undoubtedly 
were 
and 
are 
the 
most 
important 
socialist 
party. 


Marx 
and 
his 
followers 
were 
really 
serious 
about 
socialism. 
Marx 
rejected 
all 
those 
measures 
on 
behalf 
of 
particular 
groups 
and 
strata 
of 
society 
that 
are 
demanded 
by 
the 
parties 
of 
special 
interests. 
He 
did 
not 
dispute 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
liberal 
argument 
that 
the 
outcome 
of 
such 
acts 
of 
interference 
can 
only 
be 
a 
general 
reduction 
in 
the 
productivity 
of 
labor. 
When 
he 
thought, 
wrote, 
and 
spoke 
consistently, 
he 
always 
took 
the 
position 
that 
every 
attempt 



to 
tamper 
with 
the 
mechanism 
of 
the 
capitalist 
system 
by 
acts 
of 
intervention 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
government 
or 
of 
other 
social 
organs 
armed 
with 
the 
same 
coercive 
power 
is 
pointless 
because 
it 
does 
not 
bring 
about 
the 
result 
intended 
by 
its 
advocates, 
but 
instead 
reduces 
the 
productivity 
of 
the 
economy. 
Marx 
wanted 
to 
organize 
the 
workers 
for 
the 
conflict 
that 
would 
lead 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
socialism, 
but 
not 
for 
the 
achievement 
of 
certain 
special 
privileges 
within 
a 
society 
still 
based 
on 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
He 
wanted 
a 
socialist 
labor 
party, 
but 
not, 
as 
he 
put 
it, 
a 
“pettybourgeois” 
party 
aiming 
at 
individual, 
piecemeal 
reforms. 


Prevented 
by 
blind 
adherence 
to 
the 
preconceptions 
of 
his 
scholastic 
system 
from 
taking 
an 
unbiased 
view 
of 
things 
as 
they 
are, 
he 
thought 
that 
the 
workers, 
whom 
the 
writers 
under 
his 
intellectual 
influence 
had 
organized 
into 
“socialist” 
parties, 
would 
be 
content 
to 
stand 
by 
quietly 
watching 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
capitalist 
system 
according 
to 
doctrine, 
so 
as 
not 
to 
postpone 
the 
day 
when 
it 
would 
be 
fully 
ripe 
for 
the 
expropriation 
of 
the 
expropriators 
and 
would 
“turn 
into” 
socialism. 
He 
did 
not 
see 
that 
the 
labor 
parties, 
just 
like 
the 
other 
parties 
of 
special 
interests 
that 
were 
simultaneously 
springing 
up 
everywhere, 
while 
acknowledging 
the 
socialist 
program 
as 
correct 
in 
principle, 
in 
practical 
politics 
were 
concerned 
only 
with 
the 
immediate 
goal 
of 
winning 
special 
privileges 
for 
the 
workers. 
The 
Marxist 
theory 
of 
the 
solidarity 
of 
the 
interests 
of 
all 
workers, 
which 
Marx 
had 
developed 
with 
quite 
other 
political 
ends 
in 
view, 
rendered 
excellent 
service 
in 
skillfully 
concealing 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
costs 
of 
the 
victories 
won 
by 
some 
groups 
of 
workers 
had 
to 
be 
borne 
by 
other 
groups 
of 
workers; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
in 
the 
field 
of 
allegedly 
“prolabor” 
legislation, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
trade-union 
struggles, 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
proletarians 
by 
no 
means 
coincide. 
In 
this 
respect, 
the 
Marxist 
doctrine 
performed 
the 
same 
service 
for 
the 
party 
championing 
the 
special 
interests 
of 
the 
workers 
as 
was 
accomplished 
for 
the 
German 
Centrist 
and 
other 
clerical 
parties 
by 
the 
appeal 
to 
religion; 
for 
the 
nationalist 
parties, 
by 
the 
appeal 
to 
national 
solidarity; 
for 
the 
agrarian 
parties, 
by 
the 
contention 
that 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
various 
groups 
of 
agricultural 
producers 
are 
identical; 
and 
for 
the 
protectionist 
parties, 
by 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
necessity 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
tariff 
for 
the 
protection 
of 
national 
labor. 
The 
more 
the 
social-
democratic 
parties 
grew, 
the 
stronger 
became 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
trade 
unions 
within 
them 
and 
the 
more 
they 
became 
an 
association 
of 
trade 
unions 
that 
saw 
everything 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
closed 
shop 
and 
the 



increase 
of 
wages. 


Liberalism 
does 
not 
have 
the 
least 
thing 
in 
common 
with 
any 
of 
these 
parties. 
It 
stands 
at 
the 
very 
opposite 
pole 
from 
all 
of 
them. 
It 
promises 
special 
favors 
to 
no 
one. 
It 
demands 
from 
everyone 
sacrifices 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
preservation 
of 
society. 
These 
sacrifices—or, 
more 
accurately, 
the 
renunciation 
of 
immediately 
attainable 
advantages—are, 
to 
be 
sure, 
merely 
provisional; 
they 
quickly 
pay 
for 
themselves 
in 
greater 
and 
more 
lasting 
gains. 
Nevertheless, 
for 
the 
time 
being, 
they 
are 
sacrifices. 
Because 
of 
this, 
liberalism 
finds 
itself, 
from 
the 
very 
outset, 
in 
a 
peculiar 
position 
in 
the 
competition 
among 
parties. 
The 
antiliberal 
candidate 
promises 
special 
privileges 
to 
every 
particular 
group 
of 
voters: 
higher 
prices 
to 
the 
producers 
and 
lower 
prices 
to 
the 
consumers; 
higher 
salaries 
to 
public 
officeholders 
and 
lower 
taxes 
to 
taxpayers. 
He 
is 
prepared 
to 
agree 
to 
any 
desired 
expenditure 
at 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
public 
treasury 
or 
of 
the 
rich. 
No 
group 
is 
too 
small 
for 
him 
to 
disdain 
to 
seek 
its 
favor 
by 
a 
gift 
from 
the 
pocket 
of 
the 
“general 
public.” 
The 
liberal 
candidate 
can 
only 
say 
to 
all 
voters 
that 
the 
pursuit 
of 
such 
special 
favors 
is 
antisocial. 


5. 
Party 
Propaganda 
and 
Party 
Organization 
When 
liberal 
ideas 
began 
to 
spread 
to 
central 
and 
eastern 
Europe 
from 
their 
homeland 
in 
western 
Europe, 
the 
traditional 
powers—the 
monarchy, 
the 
nobility, 
and 
the 
clergy—trusting 
in 
the 
instruments 
of 
repression 
that 
were 
at 
their 
disposal, 
felt 
completely 
safe. 
They 
did 
not 
consider 
it 
necessary 
to 
combat 
liberalism 
and 
the 
mentality 
of 
the 
Enlightenment 
with 
intellectual 
weapons. 
Suppression, 
persecution, 
and 
imprisonment 
of 
the 
malcontents 
seemed 
to 
them 
to 
be 
more 
serviceable. 
They 
boasted 
of 
the 
violent 
and 
coercive 
machinery 
of 
the 
army 
and 
the 
police. 
Too 
late 
they 
realized 
with 
horror 
that 
the 
new 
ideology 
snatched 
these 
weapons 
from 
their 
hands 
by 
conquering 
the 
minds 
of 
officials 
and 
soldiers. 
It 
took 
the 
defeat 
suffered 
by 
the 
old 
regime 
in 
the 
battle 
against 
liberalism 
to 
teach 
its 
adherents 
the 
truth 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
the 
world 
more 
powerful 
than 
ideologies 
and 
ideologists 
and 
that 
only 
with 
ideas 
can 
one 
fight 
against 
ideas. 
They 
realized 
that 
it 
is 
foolish 
to 
rely 
on 
arms, 
since 
one 
can 
deploy 
armed 
men 
only 
if 
they 
are 
prepared 
to 
obey, 
and 
that 
the 
basis 
of 
all 
power 
and 
dominion 
is, 
in 
the 
last 
analysis, 
ideological. 



The 
acknowledgment 
of 
this 
sociological 
truth 
was 
one 
of 
the 
fundamental 
convictions 
on 
which 
the 
political 
theory 
of 
liberalism 
was 
based. 
From 
it 
liberalism 
had 
drawn 
no 
other 
conclusion 
than 
that, 
in 
the 
long 
run, 
truth 
and 
righteousness 
must 
triumph 
because 
their 
victory 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
ideas 
cannot 
be 
doubted. 
And 
whatever 
is 
victorious 
in 
this 
realm 
must 
ultimately 
succeed 
in 
the 
world 
of 
affairs 
as 
well, 
since 
no 
persecution 
is 
capable 
of 
suppressing 
it. 
It 
is 
therefore 
superfluous 
to 
trouble 
oneself 
especially 
about 
the 
spread 
of 
liberalism. 
Its 
victory 
is, 
in 
any 
case, 
certain. 


The 
opponents 
of 
liberalism 
can 
be 
understood 
even 
in 
this 
respect 
only 
if 
one 
keeps 
in 
mind 
that 
their 
actions 
are 
nothing 
but 
the 
reverse 
of 
what 
liberalism 
teaches; 
that 
is, 
they 
are 
based 
on 
the 
rejection 
of 
and 
reaction 
against 
liberal 
ideas. 
They 
were 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
offer 
a 
comprehensive 
and 
consistent 
body 
of 
social 
and 
economic 
doctrine 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
liberal 
ideology, 
for 
liberalism 
is 
the 
only 
possible 
conclusion 
that 
can 
be 
validly 
drawn 
from 
such 
a 
doctrine. 
Yet 
a 
program 
that 
promised 
something 
to 
only 
one 
group 
or 
a 
few 
groups 
had 
no 
chance 
of 
winning 
general 
support 
and 
was 
doomed 
from 
the 
outset 
to 
political 
failure. 
Thus, 
these 
parties 
had 
no 
other 
recourse 
than 
to 
hit 
upon 
some 
arrangement 
that 
would 
bring 
the 
groups 
to 
whom 
they 
addressed 
themselves 
completely 
under 
their 
sway 
and 
to 
keep 
them 
that 
way. 
They 
had 
to 
take 
care 
that 
liberal 
ideas 
found 
no 
adherents 
among 
the 
classes 
on 
which 
they 
depended. 


To 
this 
end, 
they 
created 
party 
organizations 
that 
hold 
the 
individual 
so 
tightly 
in 
their 
grip 
that 
he 
dare 
not 
even 
think 
of 
resigning. 
In 
Germany 
and 
Austria, 
where 
this 
system 
was 
developed 
with 
pedantic 
thoroughness, 
and 
in 
the 
countries 
of 
eastern 
Europe, 
where 
it 
was 
copied, 
the 
individual 
is 
today 
no 
longer 
primarily 
a 
citizen, 
but 
a 
party 
member. 
Already 
as 
a 
child 
he 
is 
taken 
care 
of 
by 
the 
party. 
Sports 
and 
social 
activities 
are 
organized 
on 
partisan 
lines. 
The 
farmers’ 
cooperative 
system, 
through 
whose 
intervention 
alone 
the 
farmer 
can 
lay 
claim 
to 
his 
share 
of 
the 
subsidies 
and 
grants 
accruing 
to 
agricultural 
producers; 
the 
institutions 
for 
the 
advancement 
of 
the 
professional 
classes; 
and 
the 
workingmen’s 
labor 
exchange 
and 
savings 
bank 
system 
are 
all 
managed 
along 
party 
lines. 
In 
all 
matters 
on 
which 
the 
authorities 
are 
free 
to 
use 
their 
discretion, 
the 
individual, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
respected, 
requires 
the 
support 
of 
his 
party. 
Under 
such 
circumstances, 
laxity 
in 
party 
affairs 
leads 
to 
suspicion, 
but 
resignation 
means 
serious 
economic 
detriment, 
if 
not 
ruination 
and 
social 
ostracism. 



The 
parties 
of 
special 
interests 
reserve 
for 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
professional 
classes 
a 
treatment 
peculiar 
to 
it 
alone. 
The 
independent 
professions 
of 
the 
lawyer, 
the 
doctor, 
the 
writer, 
and 
the 
artist 
are 
not 
represented 
in 
sufficiently 
great 
number 
to 
permit 
them 
to 
figure 
as 
parties 
of 
special 
interests 
in 
their 
own 
right. 
They 
are 
therefore 
the 
least 
open 
to 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
ideology 
of 
special 
class 
privileges. 
Their 
members 
clung 
longest 
and 
most 
stubbornly 
to 
liberalism. 
They 
had 
nothing 
to 
gain 
from 
adopting 
a 
policy 
of 
ruthless 
and 
unyielding 
struggle 
for 
the 
promotion 
of 
their 
particular 
interests. 
This 
was 
a 
situation 
that 
the 
parties 
working 
on 
behalf 
of 
organized 
pressure 
groups 
viewed 
with 
the 
utmost 
misgiving. 
They 
could 
not 
tolerate 
the 
intelligentsia’s 
continued 
adherence 
to 
liberalism. 
For 
they 
feared 
that 
their 
own 
ranks 
might 
be 
thinned 
if 
liberal 
ideas, 
once 
again 
developed 
and 
expounded 
by 
a 
few 
individuals 
in 
these 
groups, 
were 
to 
gain 
enough 
strength 
to 
find 
acceptance 
and 
approval 
among 
the 
mass 
of 
their 
members. 
They 
had 
just 
learned 
how 
dangerous 
such 
ideologies 
could 
be 
to 
the 
prerogatives 
of 
the 
privileged 
orders 
of 
the 
caste 
and 
status 
society. 
The 
parties 
of 
special 
interests 
therefore 
proceeded 
systematically 
to 
organize 
themselves 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
make 
the 
members 
of 
the 
“liberal” 
professions 
dependent 
on 
them. 
This 
was 
soon 
achieved 
by 
incorporating 
them 
into 
the 
mechanism 
of 
the 
party 
machinery. 
The 
doctor, 
the 
lawyer, 
the 
writer, 
the 
artist 
must 
enroll 
themselves 
in 
and 
subordinate 
themselves 
to 
the 
organization 
of 
their 
patients, 
clients, 
readers, 
and 
patrons. 
Whoever 
holds 
back 
or 
openly 
rebels 
is 
boycotted 
into 
compliance. 


The 
subjugation 
of 
the 
independent 
professional 
classes 
finds 
its 
complement 
in 
the 
procedure 
followed 
in 
making 
appointments 
to 
teaching 
positions 
and 
to 
posts 
in 
the 
civil 
service. 
Where 
the 
party 
system 
is 
fully 
developed, 
only 
party 
members 
are 
appointed, 
whether 
of 
the 
one 
currently 
in 
power 
or 
of 
all 
the 
parties 
of 
special 
interests 
in 
accordance 
with 
an 
arrangement, 
tacit 
though 
it 
may 
be, 
arrived 
at 
among 
themselves. 
And 
ultimately 
even 
the 
independent 
press 
is 
brought 
under 
control 
by 
the 
threat 
of 
a 
boycott. 


A 
crowning 
stroke 
in 
the 
organization 
of 
these 
parties 
was 
the 
establishment 
of 
their 
own 
bands 
of 
armed 
men. 
Organized 
in 
military 
fashion, 
after 
the 
pattern 
of 
the 
national 
army, 
they 
have 
drawn 
up 
their 
mobilization 
and 
operational 
plans, 
have 
weapons 
at 
their 
disposal, 
and 
are 
ready 
to 
strike. 
With 
their 
banners 
and 
brass 
bands 
they 
march 
through 
the 



streets 
heralding 
to 
the 
world 
the 
dawn 
of 
an 
era 
of 
endless 
agitation 
and 
warfare. 


Two 
circumstances 
have 
so 
far 
served 
to 
mitigate 
the 
dangers 
of 
this 
situation. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
a 
certain 
balance 
of 
power 
among 
the 
party 
forces 
has 
been 
reached 
in 
some 
of 
the 
more 
important 
countries. 
Where 
this 
is 
lacking, 
as 
in 
Russia 
and 
Italy, 
the 
power 
of 
the 
state, 
in 
disregard 
of 
the 
few 
remaining 
liberal 
principles 
that 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
world 
still 
acknowledges, 
is 
used 
to 
suppress 
and 
persecute 
the 
adherents 
of 
the 
opposition 
parties. 


The 
second 
circumstance 
that, 
for 
the 
moment, 
still 
prevents 
the 
worst 
from 
happening 
is 
that 
even 
nations 
imbued 
with 
hostility 
toward 
liberalism 
and 
capitalism 
count 
on 
capital 
investment 
from 
the 
lands 
that 
have 
been 
the 
classical 
exemplars 
of 
the 
liberal 
and 
capitalist 
mentality—above 
all, 
the 
United 
States. 
Without 
these 
credits, 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
policy 
of 
capital 
consumption 
that 
they 
have 
been 
pursuing 
would 
have 
already 
become 
much 
more 
obvious. 
Anticapitalism 
can 
maintain 
itself 
in 
existence 
only 
by 
sponging 
on 
capitalism. 
It 
must 
therefore 
take 
into 
consideration 
to 
a 
certain 
extent 
the 
public 
opinion 
of 
the 
West, 
where 
liberalism 
is 
still 
acknowledged 
today, 
even 
though 
in 
a 
much 
diluted 
form. 
In 
the 
fact 
that 
capitalists 
generally 
desire 
to 
lend 
only 
to 
such 
borrowers 
as 
hold 
out 
some 
prospect 
of 
repaying 
the 
loan, 
the 
destructionist 
parties 
profess 
to 
see 
that 
“world 
ascendancy 
of 
capital” 
about 
which 
they 
raise 
such 
a 
hue 
and 
cry. 


6. 
Liberalism 
as 
the 
“Party 
of 
Capital” 
Thus, 
it 
is 
easily 
seen 
that 
liberalism 
cannot 
be 
put 
into 
the 
same 
class 
with 
the 
parties 
of 
special 
interests 
without 
denying 
its 
very 
nature. 
It 
is 
something 
radically 
different 
from 
them 
all. 
They 
are 
out 
for 
battle 
and 
extol 
violence; 
liberalism, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
desires 
peace 
and 
the 
ascendancy 
of 
ideas. 
It 
is 
for 
this 
reason 
that 
all 
parties, 
however 
badly 
disunited 
they 
may 
otherwise 
be, 
form 
a 
united 
front 
against 
liberalism. 


The 
enemies 
of 
liberalism 
have 
branded 
it 
as 
the 
party 
of 
the 
special 
interests 
of 
the 
capitalists. 
This 
is 
characteristic 
of 
their 
mentality. 
They 
simply 
cannot 
understand 
a 
political 
ideology 
as 
anything 
but 
the 
advocacy 
of 
certain 
special 
privileges 
opposed 
to 
the 
general 
welfare. 


One 
cannot 
look 
on 
liberalism 
as 
a 
party 
of 
special 
interests, 
privileges, 
and 
prerogatives, 
because 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
is 



not 
a 
privilege 
redounding 
to 
the 
exclusive 
advantage 
of 
the 
capitalists, 
but 
an 
institution 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
society 
and 
consequently 
an 
institution 
that 
benefits 
everyone. 
This 
is 
the 
opinion 
not 
only 
of 
the 
liberals, 
but 
even, 
up 
to 
a 
certain 
point, 
of 
their 
opponents. 
When 
the 
Marxists 
champion 
the 
view 
that 
socialism 
cannot 
be 
made 
a 
reality 
until 
the 
world 
is 
“ripe” 
for 
it, 
because 
a 
social 
system 
never 
becomes 
extinct 
before 
“all 
the 
productive 
forces 
have 
developed 
for 
which 
it 
is 
broad 
enough,” 
they 
concede, 
at 
least 
for 
the 
present, 
the 
social 
indispensability 
of 
the 
institution 
of 
private 
property. 
Even 
the 
Bolsheviks, 
who 
only 
a 
little 
while 
ago 
propagated 
with 
fire, 
sword, 
and 
the 
gallows 
their 
interpretation 
of 
Marxism 
—that 
is, 
that 
“ripeness” 
had 
already 
been 
achieved—now 
have 
to 
admit 
that 
it 
is 
still 
too 
early. 
If, 
however, 
even 
if 
it 
is 
only 
for 
the 
moment, 
conditions 
are 
such 
that 
capitalism 
and 
its 
juridical 
“superstructure,” 
private 
property, 
cannot 
be 
dispensed 
with, 
can 
one 
say 
of 
an 
ideology 
that 
considers 
private 
property 
the 
foundation 
of 
society 
that 
it 
serves 
only 
to 
promote 
the 
selfish 
interests 
of 
the 
owners 
of 
capital 
against 
the 
interests 
of 
everyone 
else? 


To 
be 
sure, 
if 
the 
antiliberal 
ideologies 
treat 
private 
property 
as 
indispensable, 
whether 
just 
for 
the 
present 
or 
forever, 
they 
believe, 
nevertheless, 
that 
it 
must 
be 
regulated 
and 
restricted 
by 
authoritarian 
decrees 
and 
similar 
acts 
of 
intervention 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
state. 
They 
recommend, 
not 
liberalism 
and 
capitalism, 
but 
interventionism. 
But 
economics 
has 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
system 
of 
interventionism 
is 
contrary 
to 
purpose 
and 
self-defeating. 
It 
cannot 
attain 
the 
ends 
that 
its 
advocates 
intend 
it 
to 
attain. 
Consequently, 
it 
is 
an 
error 
to 
suppose 
that 
besides 
socialism 
(communal 
property) 
and 
capitalism 
(private 
property) 
still 
a 
third 
system 
of 
organizing 
social 
cooperation 
is 
thinkable 
and 
workable, 
namely, 
interventionism. 
Attempts 
to 
put 
interventionism 
into 
effect 
must, 
of 
necessity, 
lead 
to 
conditions 
that 
run 
counter 
to 
the 
intentions 
of 
their 
authors, 
who 
are 
then 
faced 
with 
the 
alternative 
either 
of 
abstaining 
from 
all 
acts 
of 
intervention, 
and 
thereby 
leaving 
private 
property 
on 
its 
own, 
or 
of 
replacing 
private 
property 
by 
socialism. 


This 
too 
is 
a 
thesis 
that 
liberal 
economists 
are 
not 
alone 
in 
maintaining. 
(Of 
course, 
the 
popular 
idea 
that 
economists 
are 
divided 
along 
party 
lines 
is 
altogether 
mistaken.) 
Marx 
too, 
in 
all 
his 
theoretical 
discussions, 
saw 
only 
the 
alternatives 
of 
socialism 
or 
capitalism 
and 
had 
nothing 
but 
derision 
and 
contempt 
for 
those 
reformers 
who, 
imprisoned 
in 
“petty-bourgeois 
thinking,” 



reject 
socialism 
and, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
still 
want 
to 
remodel 
capitalism. 
Economics 
has 
never 
even 
attempted 
to 
show 
that 
a 
system 
of 
private 
property 
regulated 
and 
restricted 
by 
government 
intervention 
would 
be 
practicable. 
When 
the 
“socialists 
of 
the 
chair” 
wanted 
to 
prove 
this 
at 
any 
cost, 
they 
began 
by 
denying 
the 
possibility 
of 
scientific 
knowledge 
in 
the 
economic 
field 
and 
ultimately 
ended 
by 
declaring 
that 
whatever 
the 
state 
does 
must 
surely 
be 
rational. 
Since 
science 
demonstrated 
the 
absurdity 
of 
the 
policy 
that 
they 
wished 
to 
recommend, 
they 
sought 
to 
invalidate 
logic 
and 
science. 


The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
the 
proof 
of 
the 
possibility 
and 
practicability 
of 
socialism. 
The 
pre-Marxist 
writers 
had 
labored 
in 
vain 
to 
provide 
it. 
They 
could 
not 
do 
so, 
nor 
were 
they 
able 
in 
any 
way 
to 
attack 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
weighty 
objections 
to 
the 
practicability 
of 
their 
utopia 
that 
their 
critics 
based 
on 
the 
findings 
of 
science. 
Around 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
the 
socialist 
idea 
seemed 
already 
to 
have 
been 
effectively 
disposed 
of. 
Then 
Marx 
made 
his 
appearance. 
He 
did 
not, 
to 
be 
sure, 
adduce 
the 
proof—which, 
indeed, 
cannot 
be 
adduced—that 
socialism 
is 
realizable, 
but 
he 
simply 
declared—of 
course, 
without 
being 
able 
to 
demonstrate 
it—that 
the 
coming 
of 
socialism 
is 
inevitable. 
From 
this 
arbitrary 
assumption 
and 
from 
the 
axiom, 
which 
seemed 
to 
him 
self-evident, 
that 
everything 
occurring 
later 
in 
human 
history 
represents 
an 
advance 
over 
what 
came 
earlier, 
Marx 
drew 
the 
conclusion 
that 
socialism 
is 
therefore 
more 
perfect 
than 
capitalism 
and 
so 
there 
could 
naturally 
be 
no 
doubt 
as 
to 
its 
practicability. 
Consequently, 
it 
is 
altogether 
unscientific 
to 
concern 
oneself 
with 
the 
question 
of 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
socialist 
society 
or 
even 
to 
study 
the 
problems 
of 
such 
a 
social 
order 
at 
all. 
Whoever 
wanted 
to 
try 
it 
was 
ostracized 
by 
the 
socialists 
and 
excommunicated 
by 
public 
opinion, 
which 
they 
controlled. 
Heedless 
of 
all 
these—to 
be 
sure, 
only 
external—difficulties, 
economics 
occupied 
itself 
with 
the 
theoretical 
construction 
of 
a 
socialist 
system 
and 
demonstrated 
irrefutably 
that 
every 
type 
of 
socialism 
is 
unworkable 
because 
economic 
calculation 
is 
impossible 
in 
a 
socialist 
community. 
The 
advocates 
of 
socialism 
have 
scarcely 
ventured 
to 
make 
any 
reply 
to 
this, 
and 
what 
they 
have 
advanced 
in 
rebuttal 
has 
been 
altogether 
trivial 
and 
devoid 
of 
significance. 


What 
was 
proved 
by 
science 
theoretically 
was 
corroborated 
in 
practice 
by 
the 
failure 
of 
all 
socialist 
and 
interventionist 
experiments. 


Hence, 
it 
is 
nothing 
but 
specious 
propaganda 
designed 
to 
rely 
for 
its 



effectiveness 
on 
the 
lack 
of 
judgment 
of 
the 
thoughtless 
to 
assert, 
as 
people 
do, 
that 
the 
defense 
of 
capitalism 
is 
purely 
an 
affair 
of 
the 
capitalists 
and 
the 
entrepreneurs, 
whose 
special 
interests, 
as 
opposed 
to 
those 
of 
other 
groups, 
are 
furthered 
by 
the 
capitalist 
system. 
The 
“have’s” 
do 
not 
have 
any 
more 
reason 
to 
support 
the 
institution 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
than 
do 
the 
“have-not’s.” 
If 
their 
immediate 
special 
interests 
come 
into 
question, 
they 
are 
scarcely 
liberal. 
The 
notion 
that, 
if 
only 
capitalism 
is 
preserved, 
the 
propertied 
classes 
could 
remain 
forever 
in 
possession 
of 
their 
wealth 
stems 
from 
a 
misunderstanding 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
capitalist 
economy, 
in 
which 
property 
is 
continually 
being 
shifted 
from 
the 
less 
efficient 
to 
the 
more 
efficient 
businessman. 
In 
a 
capitalist 
society 
one 
can 
hold 
on 
to 
one’s 
fortune 
only 
if 
one 
perpetually 
acquires 
it 
anew 
by 
investing 
it 
wisely. 
The 
rich, 
who 
are 
already 
in 
possession 
of 
wealth, 
have 
no 
special 
reason 
to 
desire 
the 
preservation 
of 
a 
system 
of 
unhampered 
competition 
open 
to 
all; 
particularly 
if 
they 
did 
not 
themselves 
earn 
their 
fortune, 
but 
inherited 
it, 
they 
have 
more 
to 
fear 
than 
to 
hope 
from 
competition. 
They 
do 
have 
a 
special 
interest 
in 
interventionism, 
which 
always 
has 
a 
tendency 
to 
preserve 
the 
existing 
division 
of 
wealth 
among 
those 
in 
possession 
of 
it. 
But 
they 
cannot 
hope 
for 
any 
special 
treatment 
from 
liberalism, 
a 
system 
in 
which 
no 
heed 
is 
paid 
to 
the 
time-honored 
claims 
of 
tradition 
advanced 
by 
the 
vested 
interests 
of 
established 
wealth. 


The 
entrepreneur 
can 
prosper 
only 
if 
he 
provides 
what 
the 
consumers 
demand. 
When 
the 
world 
is 
afire 
with 
the 
lust 
for 
war, 
the 
liberal 
seeks 
to 
expound 
the 
advantages 
of 
peace; 
the 
entrepreneur, 
however, 
produces 
artillery 
and 
machine-guns. 
If 
public 
opinion 
today 
favors 
capital 
investment 
in 
Russia, 
the 
liberal 
may 
endeavor 
to 
explain 
that 
it 
is 
as 
intelligent 
to 
invest 
capital 
in 
a 
land 
whose 
government 
openly 
proclaims 
as 
the 
ultimate 
goal 
of 
its 
policy 
the 
expropriation 
of 
all 
capital 
as 
it 
would 
be 
to 
dump 
goods 
into 
the 
sea; 
but 
the 
entrepreneur 
does 
not 
hesitate 
to 
furnish 
supplies 
to 
Russia 
if 
only 
he 
is 
in 
a 
position 
to 
shift 
the 
risk 
to 
others, 
whether 
it 
be 
to 
the 
state 
or 
to 
some 
less 
clever 
capitalists, 
who 
allow 
themselves 
to 
be 
misled 
by 
public 
opinion, 
itself 
manipulated 
by 
Russian 
money. 
The 
liberal 
struggles 
against 
the 
trend 
towards 
commercial 
autarky; 
the 
German 
manufacturer, 
however, 
builds 
a 
factory 
in 
the 
eastern 
province, 
which 
excludes 
German 
goods, 
in 
order 
to 
serve 
this 
market 
while 
under 
the 
protection 
of 
the 
tariff. 
Clear-
thinking 
entrepreneurs 
and 
capitalists 
may 
view 
the 
consequences 
of 
an 



antiliberal 
policy 
as 
ruinous 
for 
the 
whole 
of 
society; 
but 
in 
their 
capacity 
as 
entrepreneurs 
and 
capitalists 
they 
must 
seek, 
not 
to 
oppose 
it, 
but 
to 
adjust 
themselves 
to 
the 
given 
conditions. 


There 
is 
no 
class 
that 
could 
champion 
liberalism 
for 
its 
own 
selfish 
interests 
to 
the 
detriment 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
society 
and 
the 
other 
strata 
of 
the 
population, 
simply 
because 
liberalism 
serves 
no 
special 
interest. 
Liberalism 
cannot 
count 
on 
the 
help 
that 
the 
antiliberal 
parties 
receive 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
everyone 
who 
seeks 
to 
win 
some 
privilege 
for 
himself 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
society 
attaches 
himself 
to 
them. 
When 
the 
liberal 
comes 
before 
the 
electorate 
as 
a 
candidate 
for 
public 
office 
and 
is 
asked 
by 
those 
whose 
votes 
he 
solicits 
what 
he 
or 
his 
party 
intends 
to 
do 
for 
them 
and 
their 
group, 
the 
only 
answer 
he 
can 
give 
is: 
Liberalism 
serves 
everyone, 
but 
it 
serves 
no 
special 
interest. 


To 
be 
a 
liberal 
is 
to 
have 
realized 
that 
a 
special 
privilege 
conceded 
to 
a 
small 
group 
to 
the 
disadvantage 
of 
others 
cannot, 
in 
the 
long 
run, 
be 
preserved 
without 
a 
fight 
(civil 
war): 
but 
that, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
one 
cannot 
bestow 
privileges 
on 
the 
majority, 
since 
these 
then 
cancel 
one 
another 
out 
in 
their 
value 
for 
those 
whom 
they 
are 
supposed 
to 
specially 
favor, 
and 
the 
only 
net 
result 
is 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
productivity 
of 
social 
labor. 



5 


The 
Future 
of 
Liberalism 


All 
earlier 
civilizations 
perished, 
or 
at 
least 
reached 
a 
state 
of 
stagnation, 
long 
before 
they 
had 
attained 
the 
level 
of 
material 
development 
that 
modern 
European 
civilization 
has 
succeeded 
in 
achieving. 
Nations 
were 
destroyed 
by 
wars 
with 
foreign 
enemies 
as 
well 
as 
by 
internecine 
strife. 
Anarchy 
forced 
a 
retrogression 
in 
the 
division 
of 
labor; 
cities, 
commerce, 
and 
industry 
declined; 
and, 
with 
the 
decay 
of 
their 
economic 
foundations, 
intellectual 
and 
moral 
refinements 
had 
to 
give 
way 
to 
ignorance 
and 
brutality. 
The 
Europeans 
of 
the 
modern 
age 
have 
succeeded 
in 
intensifying 
the 
social 
bonds 
among 
individuals 
and 
nations 
much 
more 
strongly 
than 
was 
ever 
the 
case 
before 
in 
history. 
This 
was 
an 
achievement 
of 
the 
ideology 
of 
liberalism, 
which, 
from 
the 
end 
of 
the 
seventeenth 
century, 
was 
elaborated 
with 
ever 
increasing 
clarity 
and 
precision 
and 
continually 
gained 
in 
influence 
over 
men’s 
minds. 
Liberalism 
and 
capitalism 
created 
the 
foundations 
on 
which 
are 
based 
all 
the 
marvels 
characteristic 
of 
our 
modern 
way 
of 
life. 


Now 
our 
civilization 
is 
beginning 
to 
scent 
a 
whiff 
of 
death 
in 
the 
air. 
Dilettantes 
loudly 
proclaim 
that 
all 
civilizations, 
including 
our 
own, 
must 
perish: 
this 
is 
an 
inexorable 
law. 
Europe’s 
final 
hour 
has 
come, 
warn 
these 
prophets 
of 
doom, 
and 
they 
find 
credence. 
An 
autumnal 
mood 
is 
perceptibly 
beginning 
to 
set 
in 
everywhere. 


But 
modern 
civilization 
will 
not 
perish 
unless 
it 
does 
so 
by 
its 
own 
act 
of 
self-destruction. 
No 
external 
enemy 
can 
destroy 
it 
the 
way 
the 
Spaniards 
once 
destroyed 
the 
civilization 
of 
the 
Aztecs, 
for 
no 
one 
on 
earth 
can 
match 
his 
strength 
against 
the 
standard-bearers 
of 
modern 
civilization. 
Only 
inner 
enemies 
can 
threaten 
it. 
It 
can 
come 
to 
an 
end 
only 
if 
the 
ideas 
of 
liberalism 
are 
supplanted 
by 
an 
antiliberal 
ideology 
hostile 
to 
social 
cooperation. 


There 
has 
come 
to 
be 
a 
growing 
realization 
that 
material 
progress 
is 
possible 
only 
in 
a 
liberal, 
capitalist 
society. 
Even 
if 
this 
point 
is 
not 
expressly 
conceded 
by 
the 
antiliberal, 
it 
is 
fully 
acknowledged 
indirectly 
in 
the 
panegyrics 
extolling 
the 
idea 
of 
stability 
and 
a 
state 
of 
rest. 



The 
material 
advances 
of 
recent 
generations, 
it 
is 
said, 
have, 
of 
course, 
been 
really 
very 
agreeable 
and 
beneficial. 
Now, 
however, 
it 
is 
time 
to 
call 
a 
halt. 
The 
frantic 
hustle 
and 
bustle 
of 
modern 
capitalism 
must 
make 
way 
for 
tranquil 
contemplation. 
One 
must 
acquire 
time 
for 
self-communion, 
and 
so 
another 
economic 
system 
must 
take 
the 
place 
of 
capitalism, 
one 
that 
is 
not 
always 
restlessly 
chasing 
after 
novelties 
and 
innovations. 
The 
romantic 
looks 
back 
nostalgically 
to 
the 
economic 
conditions 
of 
the 
Middle 
Ages—not 
to 
the 
Middle 
Ages 
as 
they 
actually 
were, 
but 
to 
an 
image 
of 
them 
constructed 
by 
his 
fancy 
without 
any 
counterpart 
in 
historical 
reality. 
Or 
he 
turns 
his 
gaze 
upon 
the 
Orient—again 
not, 
of 
course, 
the 
real 
Orient, 
but 
a 
dream-vision 
of 
his 
fantasy. 
How 
happy 
men 
were 
without 
modern 
technology 
and 
modern 
culture! 
How 
could 
we 
ever 
have 
renounced 
this 
paradise 
so 
light-mindedly? 


Whoever 
preaches 
the 
return 
to 
simple 
forms 
of 
the 
economic 
organization 
of 
society 
ought 
to 
keep 
in 
mind 
that 
only 
our 
type 
of 
economic 
system 
offers 
the 
possibility 
of 
supporting 
in 
the 
style 
to 
which 
we 
have 
become 
accustomed 
today 
the 
number 
of 
people 
who 
now 
populate 
the 
earth. 
A 
return 
to 
the 
Middle 
Ages 
means 
the 
extermination 
of 
many 
hundreds 
of 
millions 
of 
people. 
The 
friends 
of 
stability 
and 
rest, 
it 
is 
true, 
say 
that 
one 
by 
no 
means 
has 
to 
go 
as 
far 
as 
that. 
It 
suffices 
to 
hold 
fast 
to 
what 
has 
already 
been 
achieved 
and 
to 
forgo 
further 
advances. 


Those 
who 
extol 
the 
state 
of 
rest 
and 
stable 
equilibrium 
forget 
that 
there 
is 
in 
man, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
he 
is 
a 
thinking 
being, 
an 
inherent 
desire 
for 
the 
improvement 
of 
his 
material 
condition. 
This 
impulse 
cannot 
be 
eradicated; 
it 
is 
the 
motive 
power 
of 
all 
human 
action. 
If 
one 
prevents 
a 
man 
from 
working 
for 
the 
good 
of 
society 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
providing 
for 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
his 
own 
needs, 
then 
only 
one 
way 
remains 
open 
to 
him: 
to 
make 
himself 
richer 
and 
others 
poorer 
by 
the 
violent 
oppression 
and 
spoliation 
of 
his 
fellow 
men. 


It 
is 
true 
that 
all 
this 
straining 
and 
struggling 
to 
increase 
their 
standard 
of 
living 
does 
not 
make 
men 
any 
happier. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
is 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
man 
continually 
to 
strive 
for 
an 
improvement 
in 
his 
material 
condition. 
If 
he 
is 
forbidden 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
this 
aspiration, 
he 
becomes 
dull 
and 
brutish. 
The 
masses 
will 
not 
listen 
to 
exhortations 
to 
be 
moderate 
and 
contented; 
it 
may 
be 
that 
the 
philosophers 
who 
preach 
such 
admonitions 
are 
laboring 
under 
a 
serious 
self-delusion. 
If 
one 
tells 
people 
that 
their 
fathers 
had 
it 
much 
worse, 
they 
answer 
that 
they 
do 
not 
know 
why 
they 
should 
not 
have 
it 
still 



better. 


Now, 
whether 
it 
is 
good 
or 
bad, 
whether 
it 
receives 
the 
sanction 
of 
the 
moral 
censor 
or 
not, 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
men 
always 
strive 
for 
an 
improvement 
in 
their 
conditions 
and 
always 
will. 
This 
is 
man’s 
inescapable 
destiny. 
The 
restlessness 
and 
inquietude 
of 
modern 
man 
is 
a 
stirring 
of 
the 
mind, 
the 
nerves, 
and 
the 
senses. 
One 
can 
as 
easily 
restore 
to 
him 
the 
innocence 
of 
childhood 
as 
lead 
him 
back 
to 
the 
passivity 
of 
past 
periods 
of 
human 
history. 


But, 
after 
all, 
what 
is 
being 
offered 
in 
return 
for 
the 
renunciation 
of 
further 
material 
progress? 
Happiness 
and 
contentment, 
inner 
harmony 
and 
peace 
will 
not 
be 
created 
simply 
because 
people 
are 
no 
longer 
intent 
on 
further 
improvement 
in 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
their 
needs. 
Soured 
by 
resentment, 
the 
literati 
imagine 
that 
poverty 
and 
the 
absence 
of 
wants 
create 
especially 
favorable 
conditions 
for 
the 
development 
of 
man’s 
spiritual 
capacities, 
but 
this 
is 
nonsense. 
In 
discussing 
these 
questions, 
one 
should 
avoid 
euphemisms 
and 
call 
things 
by 
their 
right 
names. 
Modern 
wealth 
expresses 
itself 
above 
all 
in 
the 
cult 
of 
the 
body: 
hygiene, 
cleanliness, 
sport. 
Today 
still 
the 
luxury 
of 
the 
well-to-do—no 
longer, 
perhaps, 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
but 
everywhere 
else 
—these 
will 
come 
within 
the 
reach 
of 
everyone 
in 
the 
not 
too 
distant 
future 
if 
economic 
development 
progresses 
as 
it 
has 
hitherto. 
Is 
it 
thought 
that 
man’s 
inner 
life 
is 
in 
any 
way 
furthered 
by 
excluding 
the 
masses 
from 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
level 
of 
physical 
culture 
that 
the 
well-to-do 
already 
enjoy? 
Is 
happiness 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
unkempt 
body? 


To 
the 
panegyrists 
of 
the 
Middle 
Ages 
one 
can 
only 
answer 
that 
we 
know 
nothing 
about 
whether 
the 
medieval 
man 
felt 
happier 
than 
the 
modern 
man. 
But 
we 
may 
leave 
it 
to 
those 
who 
hold 
up 
the 
mode 
of 
life 
of 
the 
Orientals 
as 
a 
model 
for 
us 
to 
answer 
the 
question 
whether 
Asia 
is 
really 
the 
paradise 
that 
they 
describe 
it 
as. 


The 
fulsome 
praise 
of 
the 
stationary 
economy 
as 
a 
social 
ideal 
is 
the 
last 
remaining 
argument 
that 
the 
enemies 
of 
liberalism 
have 
to 
fall 
back 
upon 
in 
order 
to 
justify 
their 
doctrines. 
Let 
us 
keep 
clearly 
in 
mind, 
however, 
that 
the 
starting-point 
of 
their 
critique 
was 
that 
liberalism 
and 
capitalism 
impede 
the 
development 
of 
productive 
forces, 
that 
they 
are 
responsible 
for 
the 
poverty 
of 
the 
masses. 
The 
opponents 
of 
liberalism 
have 
alleged 
that 
what 
they 
are 
aiming 
at 
is 
a 
social 
order 
that 
could 
create 
more 
wealth 
than 
the 
one 
they 
are 
attacking. 
And 
now, 
driven 
to 
the 
wall 
by 
the 
counterattack 
of 
economics 
and 
sociology, 
they 
must 
concede 
that 
only 
capitalism 
and 
liberalism, 
only 



private 
property 
and 
the 
unhampered 
activity 
of 
entrepreneurs, 
can 
guarantee 
the 
highest 
productivity 
of 
human 
labor. 


It 
is 
often 
maintained 
that 
what 
divides 
present-day 
political 
parties 
is 
a 
basic 
opposition 
in 
their 
ultimate 
philosophical 
commitments 
that 
cannot 
be 
settled 
by 
rational 
argument. 
The 
discussion 
of 
these 
antagonisms 
must 
therefore 
necessarily 
prove 
fruitless. 
Each 
side 
will 
remain 
unshaken 
in 
its 
conviction 
because 
the 
latter 
is 
based 
on 
a 
comprehensive 
world 
view 
that 
cannot 
be 
altered 
by 
any 
considerations 
proposed 
by 
the 
reason. 
The 
ultimate 
ends 
toward 
which 
men 
strive 
are 
diverse. 
Hence, 
it 
is 
altogether 
out 
of 
the 
question 
that 
men 
aiming 
at 
these 
diverse 
ends 
could 
agree 
on 
a 
uniform 
procedure. 


Nothing 
is 
more 
absurd 
than 
this 
belief. 
Aside 
from 
the 
few 
consistent 
ascetics, 
who 
seek 
to 
divest 
life 
of 
all 
its 
external 
trappings 
and 
who 
finally 
succeed 
in 
attaining 
to 
a 
state 
of 
renunciation 
of 
all 
desire 
and 
action 
and, 
indeed, 
of 
self-annihilation, 
all 
men 
of 
the 
white 
race, 
however 
diverse 
may 
be 
their 
views 
on 
supernatural 
matters, 
agree 
in 
preferring 
a 
social 
system 
in 
which 
labor 
is 
more 
productive 
to 
one 
in 
which 
it 
is 
less 
productive. 
Even 
those 
who 
believe 
that 
an 
ever 
progressing 
improvement 
in 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
human 
wants 
does 
no 
good 
and 
that 
it 
would 
be 
better 
if 
we 
produced 
fewer 
material 
goods—though 
it 
is 
doubtful 
whether 
the 
number 
of 
those 
who 
are 
sincerely 
of 
this 
opinion 
is 
very 
large—would 
not 
wish 
that 
the 
same 
amount 
of 
labor 
should 
result 
in 
fewer 
goods. 
At 
most, 
they 
would 
wish 
that 
there 
should 
be 
less 
labor 
and 
consequently 
less 
production, 
but 
not 
that 
the 
same 
amount 
of 
labor 
should 
produce 
less. 


The 
political 
antagonisms 
of 
today 
are 
not 
controversies 
over 
ultimate 
questions 
of 
philosophy, 
but 
opposing 
answers 
to 
the 
question 
how 
a 
goal 
that 
all 
acknowledge 
as 
legitimate 
can 
be 
achieved 
most 
quickly 
and 
with 
the 
least 
sacrifice. 
This 
goal, 
at 
which 
all 
men 
aim, 
is 
the 
best 
possible 
satisfaction 
of 
human 
wants; 
it 
is 
prosperity 
and 
abundance. 
Of 
course, 
this 
is 
not 
all 
that 
men 
aspire 
to, 
but 
it 
is 
all 
that 
they 
can 
expect 
to 
attain 
by 
resort 
to 
external 
means 
and 
by 
way 
of 
social 
cooperation. 
The 
inner 
blessings— 
happiness, 
peace 
of 
mind, 
exaltation—must 
be 
sought 
by 
each 
man 
within 
himself 
alone. 


Liberalism 
is 
no 
religion, 
no 
world 
view, 
no 
party 
of 
special 
interests. 
It 
is 
no 
religion 
because 
it 
demands 
neither 
faith 
nor 
devotion, 
because 
there 
is 
nothing 
mystical 
about 
it, 
and 
because 
it 
has 
no 
dogmas. 
It 
is 
no 
world 
view 



because 
it 
does 
not 
try 
to 
explain 
the 
cosmos 
and 
because 
it 
says 
nothing 
and 
does 
not 
seek 
to 
say 
anything 
about 
the 
meaning 
and 
purpose 
of 
human 
existence. 
It 
is 
no 
party 
of 
special 
interests 
because 
it 
does 
not 
provide 
or 
seek 
to 
provide 
any 
special 
advantage 
whatsoever 
to 
any 
individual 
or 
any 
group. 
It 
is 
something 
entirely 
different. 
It 
is 
an 
ideology, 
a 
doctrine 
of 
the 
mutual 
relationship 
among 
the 
members 
of 
society 
and, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
application 
of 
this 
doctrine 
to 
the 
conduct 
of 
men 
in 
actual 
society. 
It 
promises 
nothing 
that 
exceeds 
what 
can 
be 
accomplished 
in 
society 
and 
through 
society. 
It 
seeks 
to 
give 
men 
only 
one 
thing, 
the 
peaceful, 
undisturbed 
development 
of 
material 
well-being 
for 
all, 
in 
order 
thereby 
to 
shield 
them 
from 
the 
external 
causes 
of 
pain 
and 
suffering 
as 
far 
as 
it 
lies 
within 
the 
power 
of 
social 
institutions 
to 
do 
so 
at 
all. 
To 
diminish 
suffering, 
to 
increase 
happiness: 
that 
is 
its 
aim. 


No 
sect 
and 
no 
political 
party 
has 
believed 
that 
it 
could 
afford 
to 
forgo 
advancing 
its 
cause 
by 
appealing 
to 
men’s 
senses. 
Rhetorical 
bombast, 
music 
and 
song 
resound, 
banners 
wave, 
flowers 
and 
colors 
serve 
as 
symbols, 
and 
the 
leaders 
seek 
to 
attach 
their 
followers 
to 
their 
own 
person. 
Liberalism 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
all 
this. 
It 
has 
no 
party 
flower 
and 
no 
party 
color, 
no 
party 
song 
and 
no 
party 
idols, 
no 
symbols 
and 
no 
slogans. 
It 
has 
the 
substance 
and 
the 
arguments. 
These 
must 
lead 
it 
to 
victory. 



Appendix 


1. 
On 
the 
Literature 
of 
Liberalism 
In 
order 
to 
keep 
this 
book 
from 
becoming 
overlong, 
I 
have 
had 
to 
be 
brief. 
I 
considered 
myself 
all 
the 
more 
justified 
in 
being 
so 
since 
I 
have 
already 
treated 
thoroughly 
all 
the 
basic 
problems 
of 
liberalism 
in 
a 
series 
of 
comprehensive 
books 
and 
essays. 


For 
the 
reader 
who 
wishes 
to 
acquire 
a 
more 
exhaustive 
understanding 
of 
these 
matters, 
I 
append 
the 
following 
compilation 
of 
the 
most 
important 
literature. 


Liberal 
ideas 
are 
already 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
works 
of 
many 
of 
the 
earlier 
writers. 
The 
great 
English 
and 
Scotch 
thinkers 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
and 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
were 
the 
first 
to 
formulate 
these 
ideas 
into 
a 
system. 
Whoever 
wants 
to 
familiarize 
himself 
with 
the 
liberal 
mind 
must 
return 
to 
them: 


David 
Hume, 
Essays 
Moral, 
Political, 
and 
Literary 
(1741 
and 


1742), 
and 


Adam 
Smith, 
An 
Inquiry 
into 
the 
Nature 
and 
Causes 
of 
the 


Wealth 
of 
Nations 
(1776), 
but 
especially 


Jeremy 
Bentham, 
numerous 
writings, 
beginning 
with 
Defence 


of 
Usury 
(1787), 
up 
to 
the 
Deontology, 
or 
the 
Science 
of 


Morality, 
published 
after 
his 
death 
in 
1834. 
All 
his 
writings, 


with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
Deontology, 
were 
published 
in 
the 


complete 
edition 
edited 
by 
Bowring 
between 
1838 
and 
1843. 


John 
Stuart 
Mill 
is 
an 
epigone 
of 
classical 
liberalism 
and, 
especially 
in 
his 
later 
years, 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
his 
wife, 
full 
of 
feeble 
compromises. 
He 
slips 
slowly 
into 
socialism 
and 
is 
the 
originator 
of 
the 
thoughtless 
confounding 
of 
liberal 
and 
socialist 
ideas 
that 
led 
to 
the 
decline 
of 
English 
liberalism 
and 
to 
the 
undermining 
of 
the 
living 
standards 
of 
the 
English 
people. 
Nevertheless—or 
perhaps 
precisely 
because 
of 
this—one 
must 
become 
acquainted 
with 
Mill’s 
principal 
writings: 



Principles 
of 
Political 
Economy 
(1848) 
On 
Liberty 
(1859) 
Utilitarianism 
(1862) 


Without 
a 
thorough 
study 
of 
Mill 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
understand 
the 
events 
of 
the 
last 
two 
generations. 
For 
Mill 
is 
the 
great 
advocate 
of 
socialism. 
All 
the 
arguments 
that 
could 
be 
advanced 
in 
favor 
of 
socialism 
are 
elaborated 
by 
him 
with 
loving 
care. 
In 
comparison 
with 
Mill 
all 
other 
socialist 
writers—even 
Marx, 
Engels, 
and 
Lassalle—are 
scarcely 
of 
any 
importance. 


One 
cannot 
understand 
liberalism 
without 
a 
knowledge 
of 
economics. 
For 
liberalism 
is 
applied 
economics; 
it 
is 
social 
and 
political 
policy 
based 
on 
a 
scientific 
foundation. 
Here, 
besides 
the 
writings 
already 
mentioned, 
one 
must 
familiarize 
oneself 
with 
the 
great 
master 
of 
classical 
economics: 


David 
Ricardo, 
Principles 
of 
Political 
Economy 
and 
Taxation 
(1817). 


The 
best 
introductions 
to 
the 
study 
of 
modern 
scientific 
economics 
are: 


H. 
Oswalt, 
Vorträge 
über 
wirtschaftliche 
Grundbegriffe 
(many 
editions) 
C. 
A. 
Verrijn 
Stuart, 
Die 
Grundlagen 
der 
Volkswirtschaft 
(1923). 
The 
German 
masterpieces 
of 
modern 
economics 
are: 


Carl 
Menger, 
Grundsätze 
der 
Volkswirtschaftslehre 
(first 
edition, 
1871). 
An 
English 
translation 
of 
the 
first 
part 
of 
this 
work 
has 
been 
made 
available 
under 
the 
title, 
Principles 
of 
Economics 
(Glencoe, 
Ill., 
1950). 
Eugen 
von 
Böhm-Bawerk: 
The 
Positive 
Theory 
of 
Capital 
(New 
York, 
1923). 
Also 
instructive 
is 
his 
Karl 
Marx 
and 
the 
Close 
of 
His 
System 
(New 
York, 
1949). 


The 
two 
most 
important 
contributions 
that 
Germany 
made 
to 
liberal 
literature 
suffered 
a 
misfortune 
no 
different 
from 
that 
which 
befell 
German 
liberalism 
itself. 
Wilhelm 
von 
Humboldt’s 
On 
the 
Sphere 
and 
Duties 
of 



Government 
(London, 
1854) 
lay 
completed 
in 
1792. 
In 
the 
same 
year 
Schiller 
published 
an 
excerpt 
in 
the 
Neuen 
Thalia, 
and 
other 
excerpts 
appeared 
in 
the 
Berliner 
Monatsschrift. 
Since, 
however, 
Humboldt’s 
publisher 
feared 
to 
issue 
the 
book, 
it 
was 
set 
aside, 
forgotten, 
and, 
only 
after 
the 
death 
of 
the 
author, 
discovered 
and 
published. 


Hermann 
Heinrich 
Gossen’s 
work, 
Entwicklung 
der 
Gesetze 
des 
menschlichen 
Verkehrs 
und 
der 
daraus 
fliessenden 
Regeln 
für 
menschliches 
Handeln, 
found 
a 
publisher, 
to 
be 
sure, 
but 
when 
it 
appeared 
in 
1854 
it 
attracted 
no 
readers. 
The 
work 
and 
its 
author 
remained 
forgotten 
until 
the 
Englishman 
Adamson 
came 
upon 
a 
copy. 


Liberal 
thinking 
permeates 
German 
classical 
poetry, 
above 
all 
the 
works 
of 
Goethe 
and 
Schiller. 


The 
history 
of 
political 
liberalism 
in 
Germany 
is 
brief 
and 
marked 
by 
rather 
meager 
success. 
Modern 
Germany—and 
this 
includes 
the 
defenders 
of 
the 
Weimar 
Constitution 
no 
less 
than 
their 
opponents—is 
a 
world 
apart 
from 
the 
spirit 
of 
liberalism. 
People 
in 
Germany 
no 
longer 
know 
what 
liberalism 
is, 
but 
they 
know 
how 
to 
revile 
it. 
Hatred 
of 
liberalism 
is 
the 
only 
point 
on 
which 
the 
Germans 
are 
united. 
Of 
the 
newer 
German 
writings 
on 
liberalism 
reference 
should 
be 
made 
to 
the 
works 
of 
Leopold 
von 
Wiese, 
Der 
Liberalismus 
in 
Vergangenheit 
und 
Zukunft 
(1917); 
Staatssozialismus 
(1916); 
and 
Freie 
Wirtschaft 
(1918). 


Hardly 
a 
breath 
of 
the 
liberal 
spirit 
has 
ever 
reached 
the 
peoples 
of 
eastern 
Europe. 


Although 
liberal 
thought 
is 
in 
decline 
even 
in 
western 
Europe 
and 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
one 
may 
yet 
call 
these 
nations 
liberal 
in 
comparison 
to 
the 
Germans. 


Of 
the 
older 
liberal 
writers 
one 
should 
also 
read 
Frédéric 
Bastiat, 
Oeuvres 
Complètes 
(Paris, 
1855). 
Bastiat 
was 
a 
brilliant 
stylist, 
so 
that 
the 
reading 
of 
his 
writings 
affords 
a 
quite 
genuine 
pleasure. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
tremendous 
advances 
that 
economic 
theory 
has 
made 
since 
his 
death, 
it 
is 
not 
astonishing 
that 
his 
teachings 
are 
obsolete 
today. 
Yet 
his 
critique 
of 
all 
protectionist 
and 
related 
tendencies 
is 
even 
today 
unsurpassed. 
The 
protectionists 
and 
interventionists 
have 
not 
been 
able 
to 
advance 
a 
single 
word 
in 
pertinent 
and 
objective 
rejoinder. 
They 
just 
continue 
to 
stammer: 
Bastiat 
is 
“superficial.” 


In 
reading 
the 
more 
recent 
political 
literature 
in 
English, 
one 
must 
not 



ignore 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
England 
today 
the 
word 
“liberalism” 
is 
frequently 
understood 
as 
denoting 
a 
moderate 
socialism. 
A 
concise 
presentation 
of 
liberalism 
is 
given 
by 
the 
Englishman, 
L. 
T. 
Hobhouse, 
Liberalism 
(1911), 
and 
by 
the 
American, 
Jacob 
H. 
Hollander, 
Economic 
Liberalism 
(1925). 
Even 
better 
introductions 
to 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
English 
liberals 
are:

Withers,

for 
Capitalism

(pp. 
74

literature

basic 
problems

economic 
system.

of 
protectionist 
policy 
is 
presented 
by 
Francis 
W. 
Hirst 
in

Protection 
(1926). 


Also 
instructive 
is 
the 
record 
of 
the 
public 
debate 
held 
in 
New 
York 
on 
January 
23, 
1921, 
between 
E. 
R. 
A. 
Seligmann 
and 
Scott 
Nearing 
on 
the 
topic: 
“That 
capitalism 
has 
more 
to 
offer 
to 
the 
workers 
of 
the 
United 
States 
than 
has 
socialism.”

2. 
On 
the 
Term 
“Liberalism” 
Those 
who 
are 
familiar 
with 
the 
writings 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
liberalism 
that 
have 
appeared 
in 
the 
last 
few 
years 
and 
with 
current 
linguistic 
usage 
will 
perhaps 
object 
that 
what 
has 
been 
called 
liberalism 
in 
the 
present 
volume 
does 
not 
coincide 
with 
what 
is 
understood 
by 
that 
term 
in 
contemporary 
political 
literature. 
I 
am 
far 
from 
disputing 
this. 
On 
the 
contrary! 
I 
have 
myself 
expressly 
pointed 
out 
that 
what 
is 
understood 
by 
the 
term 
“liberalism” 
today, 
especially 
in 
Germany, 
stands 
in 
direct 
opposition 
to 
what 
the 
history 
of 
ideas 
must 
designate 
as 
“liberalism” 
because 
it 
constituted 
the 
essential 
content 
of 
the 
liberal 
program 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
and 
nineteenth 
centuries. 
Almost 
all 
who 
call 
themselves 
“liberals” 
today 
decline 
to 
profess 
themselves 
in 
favor 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
and 
advocate 
measures 
partly 
socialist 
and 
partly 
interventionist. 
They 
seek 
to 
justify 
this 
on 
the 
ground 
that 
the 
essence 
of 
liberalism 
does 
not 
consist 
in 
adherence 
to 
the 
institution 
of 
private 
property, 
but 
in 
other 
things, 
and 
that 
these 
other 
things 
demand 
a 
further 
development 
of 
liberalism, 
so 
that 
it 
must 
today 
no 
longer 
advocate 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
but 
instead 
either 
socialism 
or 
interventionism. 


As 
to 
just 
what 
these 
“other 
things” 
might 
be, 
these 
pseudo 
liberals 
have 
yet 
to 
enlighten 
us. 
We 
hear 
much 
about 
humanity, 
magnanimity, 
real 
freedom, 
etc. 
These 
are 
certainly 
very 
fine 
and 
noble 
sentiments, 
and 
everyone 
will 
readily 
subscribe 
to 
them. 
And, 
in 
fact, 
every 
ideology 
does 
subscribe 
to 
them. 
Every 
ideology—aside 
from 
a 
few 
cynical 
schools 
of 
thought—believes 
that 
it 
is 
championing 
humanity, 
magnanimity, 
real 
freedom, 
etc. 
What 
distinguishes 
one 
social 
doctrine 
from 
another 
is 
not 
the 
ultimate 
goal 
of 
universal 
human 
happiness, 
which 
they 
all 
aim 
at, 
but 
the 
way 
by 
which 
they 
seek 
to 
attain 
this 
end. 
The 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
liberalism 
is 
that 
it 
proposes 
to 
reach 
it 
by 
way 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 



means 
of 
production. 


But 
terminological 
issues 
are, 
after 
all, 
of 
secondary 
importance. 
What 
counts 
is 
not 
the 
name, 
but 
the 
thing 
signified 
by 
it. 
However 
fanatical 
may 
be 
one’s 
opposition 
to 
private 
property, 
one 
must 
still 
concede 
at 
least 
the 
possibility 
that 
someone 
may 
be 
in 
favor 
of 
it. 
And 
if 
one 
concedes 
this 
much, 
one 
will, 
of 
course, 
have 
to 
have 
some 
name 
to 
designate 
this 
school 
of 
thought. 
One 
must 
ask 
those 
who 
today 
call 
themselves 
liberals 
what 
name 
they 
would 
give 
to 
an 
ideology 
that 
advocates 
the 
preservation 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
They 
will 
perhaps 
answer 
that 
they 
wish 
to 
call 
this 
ideology 
“Manchesterism.” 
The 
word 
“Manchesterism” 
was 
originally 
coined 
as 
a 
term 
of 
derision 
and 
abuse. 
Nevertheless, 
this 
would 
not 
stand 
in 
the 
way 
of 
its 
being 
employed 
to 
designate 
the 
liberal 
ideology 
if 
it 
were 
not 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
this 
expression 
has 
hitherto 
always 
been 
used 
to 
denote 
the 
economic 
rather 
than 
the 
general 
program 
of 
liberalism. 


The 
school 
of 
thought 
that 
advocates 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
must 
in 
any 
case 
also 
be 
granted 
a 
claim 
to 
some 
name 
or 
other. 
But 
it 
is 
best 
to 
adhere 
to 
the 
traditional 
name. 
It 
would 
create 
only 
confusion 
if 
one 
followed 
the 
new 
usage 
that 
allows 
even 
protectionists, 
socialists, 
and 
warmongers 
to 
call 
themselves 
“liberal” 
when 
it 
suits 
them 
to 
do 
so. 


The 
question 
could 
rather 
be 
raised 
whether, 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
facilitating 
the 
diffusion 
of 
liberal 
ideas, 
one 
ought 
not 
to 
give 
the 
ideology 
of 
liberalism 
a 
new 
name, 
so 
that 
the 
general 
prejudice 
fostered 
against 
it, 
especially 
in 
Germany, 
should 
not 
stand 
in 
its 
way. 
Such 
a 
suggestion 
would 
be 
well-
intentioned, 
but 
completely 
antithetic 
to 
the 
spirit 
of 
liberalism. 
Just 
as 
liberalism 
must, 
from 
inner 
necessity, 
eschew 
every 
trick 
of 
propaganda 
and 
all 
the 
underhanded 
means 
of 
winning 
general 
acceptance 
favored 
by 
other 
movements, 
so 
it 
must 
also 
avoid 
abandoning 
its 
old 
name 
simply 
because 
it 
is 
unpopular. 
Precisely 
because 
the 
word 
“liberal” 
has 
a 
bad 
connotation 
in 
Germany, 
liberalism 
must 
stick 
to 
it. 
One 
may 
not 
make 
the 
way 
to 
liberal 
thinking 
easier 
for 
anyone, 
for 
what 
is 
of 
importance 
is 
not 
that 
men 
declare 
themselves 
liberals, 
but 
that 
they 
become 
liberals 
and 
think 
and 
act 
as 
liberals. 


A 
second 
objection 
that 
can 
be 
raised 
against 
the 
terminology 
used 
in 
this 
book 
is 
that 
liberalism 
and 
democracy 
are 
not 
here 
conceived 
as 
opposites. 
Today 
in 
Germany 
“liberalism” 
is 
often 
taken 
to 
mean 
the 
doctrine 
whose 
political 
ideal 
is 
the 
constitutional 
monarchy, 
and 
“democracy” 
is 



understood 
as 
that 
which 
takes 
as 
its 
political 
ideal 
the 
parliamentary 
monarchy 
of 
the 
republic. 
This 
view 
is, 
even 
historically, 
altogether 
untenable. 
It 
was 
the 
parliamentary, 
not 
the 
constitutional, 
monarchy 
that 
liberalism 
strove 
for, 
and 
its 
defeat 
in 
this 
regard 
consisted 
precisely 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
the 
German 
Empire 
and 
in 
Austria 
it 
was 
able 
to 
achieve 
only 
a 
constitutional 
monarchy. 
The 
triumph 
of 
antiliberalism 
lay 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
German 
Reichstag 
was 
so 
weak 
that 
it 
might 
be 
accurately, 
if 
not 
politely, 
characterized 
as 
a 
“babblers’ 
club,” 
and 
the 
conservative 
party 
leader 
who 
said 
that 
a 
lieutenant 
and 
twelve 
men 
would 
suffice 
to 
dissolve 
the 
Reichstag 
was 
speaking 
the 
truth. 


Liberalism 
is 
the 
more 
comprehensive 
concept. 
It 
denotes 
an 
ideology 
embracing 
all 
of 
social 
life. 
The 
ideology 
of 
democracy 
encompasses 
only 
that 
part 
of 
the 
realm 
of 
social 
relationships 
that 
refers 
to 
the 
constitution 
of 
the 
state. 
The 
reason 
why 
liberalism 
must 
necessarily 
demand 
democracy 
as 
its 
political 
corollary 
was 
demonstrated 
in 
the 
first 
part 
of 
this 
book. 
To 
show 
why 
all 
antiliberal 
movements, 
including 
socialism, 
must 
also 
be 
antidemocratic 
is 
the 
task 
of 
investigations 
that 
undertake 
to 
provide 
a 
thorough 
analysis 
of 
the 
character 
of 
these 
ideologies. 
In 
regard 
to 
socialism, 
I 
have 
attempted 
this 
in 
my 
book 
of 
that 
title. 


It 
is 
easy 
for 
a 
German 
to 
go 
astray 
here, 
for 
he 
thinks 
always 
of 
the 
National 
Liberals 
and 
the 
Social 
Democrats. 
But 
the 
National 
Liberals 
were 
not, 
even 
from 
the 
outset—at 
least 
in 
matters 
of 
constitutional 
law—a 
liberal 
party. 
They 
were 
that 
wing 
of 
the 
old 
liberal 
party 
which 
professed 
to 
take 
its 
stand 
on 
“the 
facts 
as 
they 
really 
are”; 
that 
is, 
which 
accepted 
as 
unalterable 
the 
defeat 
that 
liberalism 
had 
sustained 
in 
the 
Prussian 
constitutional 
conflict 
from 
the 
opponents 
on 
the 
“Right” 
(Bismarck) 
and 
on 
the 
“Left” 
(the 
followers 
of 
Lassalle). 
The 
Social 
Democrats 
were 
democratic 
only 
so 
long 
as 
they 
were 
not 
the 
ruling 
party; 
that 
is, 
so 
long 
as 
they 
still 
felt 
themselves 
not 
strong 
enough 
to 
suppress 
their 
opponents 
by 
force. 
The 
moment 
they 
thought 
themselves 
the 
strongest, 
they 
declared 
themselves—as 
their 
writers 
had 
always 
asserted 
was 
advisable 
at 
this 
point—for 
dictatorship. 
Only 
when 
the 
armed 
bands 
of 
the 
Rightist 
parties 
had 
inflicted 
bloody 
defeats 
on 
them 
did 
they 
again 
become 
democratic 
“until 
further 
notice.” 
Their 
party 
writers 
express 
this 
by 
saying: 
“In 
the 
councils 
of 
the 
social 
democratic 
parties, 
the 
wing 
which 
declared 
for 
democracy 
triumphed 
over 
the 
one 
which 
championed 
dictatorship.” 



Of 
course, 
the 
only 
party 
that 
may 
properly 
be 
described 
as 
democratic 
is 
one 
that 
under 
all 
circumstances—even 
when 
it 
is 
the 
strongest 
and 
in 
control—champions 
democratic 
institutions.
