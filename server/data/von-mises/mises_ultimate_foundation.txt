Preface 


This 
essay 
is 
not 
a 
contribution 
to 
philosophy. 
It 
is 
merely 
the 
exposition 
of 
certain 
ideas 
that 
attempts 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
theory 
of 
knowledge 
ought 
to 
take 
into 
full 
account. 


Traditional 
logic 
and 
epistemology 
have 
produced, 
by 
and 
large, 
merely 
disquisitions 
on 
mathematics 
and 
the 
methods 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
The 
philosophers 
considered 
physics 
as 
the 
paragon 
of 
science 
and 
blithely 
assumed 
that 
all 
knowledge 
is 
to 
be 
fashioned 
on 
its 
model. 
They 
dispensed 
with 
biology, 
satisfying 
themselves 
that 
one 
day 
later 
generations 
would 
succeed 
in 
reducing 
the 
phenomena 
of 
life 
to 
the 
operation 
of 
elements 
that 
can 
be 
fully 
described 
by 
physics. 
They 
slighted 
history 
as 
“mere 
literature” 
and 
ignored 
the 
existence 
of 
economics. 
Positivism, 
as 
foreshadowed 
by 
Laplace, 
baptized 
by 
Auguste 
Comte, 
and 
resuscitated 
and 
systematized 
by 
contemporary 
logical 
or 
empirical 
positivism, 
is 
essentially 
panphysicalism, 
a 
scheme 
to 
deny 
that 
there 
is 
any 
other 
method 
of 
scientific 
thinking 
than 
that 
starting 
from 
the 
physicist’s 
recording 
of 
“protocol 
sentences.” 
Its 
materialism 
encountered 
opposition 
only 
on 
the 
part 
of 
metaphysicians 
who 
freely 
indulged 
in 
the 
invention 
of 
fictitious 
entities 
and 
of 
arbitrary 
systems 
of 
what 
they 
called 
“philosophy 
of 
history.” 


This 
essay 
proposes 
to 
stress 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
is 
in 
the 
universe 
something 
for 
the 
description 
and 
analysis 
of 
which 
the 
natural 
sciences 
cannot 
contribute 
anything. 
There 
are 
events 
beyond 
the 
range 
of 
those 
events 
that 
the 
procedures 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
are 
fit 
to 
observe 
and 
to 
describe. 
There 
is 
human 
action. 


It 
is 
a 
fact 
that 
up 
to 
now 
nothing 
has 
been 
done 
to 
bridge 
over 
the 
gulf 
that 
yawns 
between 
the 
natural 
events 
in 
the 
consummation 
of 
which 
science 
is 
unable 
to 
find 
any 
finality 
and 
the 
conscious 
acts 
of 
men 
that 
invariably 
aim 
at 
definite 
ends. 
To 
neglect, 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
human 
action, 
reference 
to 
the 
ends 
aimed 
at 
by 
the 
actors 
is 
no 
less 
absurd 
than 
were 
the 
endeavors 
to 
resort 
to 
finality 
in 
the 
interpretation 
of 
natural 
phenomena. 


It 
would 
be 
a 
mistake 
to 
insinuate 
that 
all 
the 
errors 
concerning 
the 
epistemological 
interpretation 
of 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
are 
to 
be 
ascribed 
to 
the 
unwarranted 
adoption 
of 
the 
epistemology 
of 
positivism. 
There 
were 
other 
schools 
of 
thought 
that 
confused 
the 
philosophical 



treatment 
of 
praxeology 
and 
history 
even 
more 
seriously 
than 
positivism, 
e.g., 
historicism. 
Yet, 
the 
following 
analysis 
deals 
first 
of 
all 
with 
the 
impact 
of 
positivism.1 


In 
order 
to 
avoid 
misinterpretation 
of 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
this 
essay, 
it 
is 
advisable, 
even 
necessary, 
to 
stress 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
deals 
with 
knowledge, 
science, 
and 
reasonable 
belief 
and 
that 
it 
refers 
to 
metaphysical 
doctrines 
only 
as 
far 
as 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
demonstrate 
in 
what 
respects 
they 
differ 
from 
scientific 
knowledge. 
It 
unreservedly 
endorses 
Locke’s 
principle 
of 
“not 
entertaining 
any 
proposition 
with 
greater 
assurance 
than 
the 
proofs 
it 
is 
built 
upon 
will 
warrant.” 
The 
viciousness 
of 
positivism 
is 
not 
to 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
adoption 
of 
this 
principle, 
but 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
does 
not 
acknowledge 
any 
other 
ways 
of 
proving 
a 
proposition 
than 
those 
practiced 
by 
the 
experimental 
natural 
sciences 
and 
qualifies 
as 
metaphysical—which, 
in 
the 
positivist 
jargon, 
is 
synonymous 
with 
nonsensical—all 
other 
methods 
of 
rational 
discourse. 
To 
expose 
the 
fallaciousness 
of 
this 
fundamental 
thesis 
of 
positivism 
and 
to 
depict 
its 
disastrous 
consequences 
is 
the 
only 
theme 
of 
this 
essay. 


Although 
full 
of 
contempt 
for 
all 
it 
considers 
as 
metaphysics, 
the 
epistemology 
of 
positivism 
is 
itself 
based 
upon 
a 
definite 
brand 
of 
metaphysics. 
It 
is 
beyond 
the 
pale 
of 
a 
rational 
inquiry 
to 
enter 
into 
an 
analysis 
of 
any 
variety 
of 
metaphysics, 
to 
try 
to 
appraise 
its 
value 
or 
its 
tenability 
and 
to 
affirm 
or 
to 
reject 
it. 
What 
discursive 
reasoning 
can 
achieve 
is 
merely 
to 
show 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
metaphysical 
doctrine 
in 
question 
contradicts 
what 
has 
been 
established 
as 
scientifically 
proved 
truth. 
If 
this 
can 
be 
demonstrated 
with 
regard 
to 
positivism’s 
assertions 
concerning 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action, 
its 
claims 
are 
to 
be 
rejected 
as 
unwarranted 
fables. 
The 
positivists 
themselves, 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
their 
own 
philosophy, 
could 
not 
help 
but 
approve 
of 
such 
a 
verdict. 


General 
epistemology 
can 
be 
studied 
only 
by 
those 
who 
are 
perfectly 
familiar 
with 
all 
branches 
of 
human 
knowledge. 
The 
special 
epistemological 
problems 
of 
the 
different 
fields 
of 
knowledge 
are 
accessible 
only 
to 
those 
who 
have 
a 
perfect 
acquaintance 
with 
the 
respective 
field. 
There 
would 
not 
be 
any 
need 
to 
mention 
this 
point 
if 
it 
were 
not 
for 
the 
shocking 
ignorance 
of 
everything 
concerning 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
that 
characterizes 
the 
writings 
of 
almost 
all 
contemporary 
philosophers.2 


It 
may 
even 
be 
doubted 
whether 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
separate 
the 
analysis 
of 
epistemological 
problems 
from 
the 
treatment 
of 
the 
substantive 
issues 
of 
the 



science 
concerned. 
The 
basic 
contributions 
to 
the 
modern 
epistemology 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
were 
an 
accomplishment 
of 
Galilei, 
not 
of 
Bacon, 
of 
Newton 
and 
Lavoisier, 
not 
of 
Kant 
and 
Comte. 
What 
is 
tenable 
in 
the 
doctrines 
of 
logical 
positivism 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
works 
of 
the 
great 
physicists 
of 
the 
last 
hundred 
years, 
not 
in 
the 
“Encyclopedia 
of 
Unified 
Science.” 
My 
own 
contributions 
to 
the 
theory 
of 
knowledge, 
however 
modest 
they 
may 
be, 
are 
in 
my 
economic 
and 
historical 
writings, 
especially 
in 
my 
books 
Human 
Action 
and 
Theory 
and 
History. 
The 
present 
essay 
is 
merely 
a 
supplement 
to 
and 
a 
commentary 
on 
what 
economics 
itself 
says 
about 
its 
own 
epistemology. 


He 
who 
seriously 
wants 
to 
grasp 
the 
purport 
of 
economic 
theory 
ought 
to 
familiarize 
himself 
first 
with 
what 
economics 
teaches 
and 
only 
then, 
having 
again 
and 
again 
reflected 
upon 
these 
theorems, 
turn 
to 
the 
study 
of 
the 
epistemological 
aspects 
concerned. 
Without 
a 
most 
careful 
examination 
of 
at 
least 
some 
of 
the 
great 
issues 
of 
praxeological 
thinking—as, 
e.g., 
the 
law 
of 
returns 
(mostly 
called 
the 
law 
of 
diminishing 
returns), 
the 
Ricardian 
law 
of 
association 
(better 
known 
as 
the 
law 
of 
comparative 
cost), 
the 
problem 
of 
economic 
calculation, 
and 
so 
on—nobody 
can 
expect 
to 
comprehend 
what 
praxeology 
means 
and 
what 
its 
specific 
epistemological 
problems 
involve.

The 
Permanent 
Substratum 
of 
Epistemology 
Πάντα 
ε 
, 
everything 
is 
in 
a 
ceasless 
flux, 
says 
Heraclitus; 
there 
is 
no 
permanent 
being; 
all 
is 
change 
and 
becoming. 
It 
must 
be 
left 
to 
metaphysical 
speculation 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
problems 
whether 
this 
proposition 
can 
be 
borne 
out 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
a 
superhuman 
intelligence 
and 
furthermore 
whether 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
a 
human 
mind 
to 
think 
of 
change 
without 
implying 
the 
concept 
of 
a 
substratum 
that, 
while 
it 
changes, 
remains 
in 
some 
regard 
and 
sense 
constant 
in 
the 
succession 
of 
its 
various 
states. 
For 
epistemology, 
the 
theory 
of 
human 
knowledge, 
there 
is 
certainly 
something 
that 
it 
cannot 
help 
considering 
as 
permanent, 
viz., 
the 
logical 
and 
praxeological 
structure 
of 
the 
human 
mind, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
the 
power 
of 
the 
human 
senses, 
on 
the 
other 
hand. 
Fully 
aware 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
human 
nature 
as 
it 
is 
in 
this 
epoch 
of 
cosmic 
changes 
in 
which 
we 
are 
living 
is 
neither 
something 
that 
existed 
from 
the 
very 
beginning 
of 
all 
things 
nor 
something 
that 
will 
remain 
forever, 
epistemology 
must 
look 
upon 
it 
as 
if 
it 
were 
unchanging. 
The 
natural 
sciences 
may 
try 
to 
go 
further 
and 
to 
study 
the 
problems 
of 
evolution. 
But 
epistemology 
is 
a 
branch—or 
rather, 
the 
basis—of 
the 
sciences 
of 
man. 
It 
deals 
with 
one 
aspect 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
man 
as 
he 
emerged 
from 
the 
aeons 
of 
cosmic 
becoming 
and 
as 
he 
is 
in 
this 
period 
of 
the 
history 
of 
the 
universe. 
It 
does 
not 
deal 
with 
thinking, 
perceiving 
and 
knowing 
in 
general, 
but 
with 
human 
thinking, 
perceiving 
and 
knowing. 
For 
epistemology 
there 
is 
something 
that 
it 
must 
take 
as 
unchanging, 
viz., 
the 
logical 
and 
praxeological 



structure 
of 
the 
human 
mind. 


One 
must 
not 
confuse 
knowledge 
with 
mysticism. 
The 
mystic 
may 
say 
that 
“shadow 
and 
sunlight 
are 
the 
same.”1 
Knowledge 
starts 
from 
the 
clear 
distinction 
between 
A 
and 
non-A. 


We 
know 
that 
there 
were 
ages 
of 
cosmic 
history 
in 
which 
there 
did 
not 
exist 
beings 
of 
the 
kind 
we 
call 
Homo 
sapiens, 
and 
we 
are 
free 
to 
assume 
that 
there 
will 
be 
again 
ages 
in 
which 
this 
species 
will 
not 
exist. 
But 
it 
is 
vain 
for 
us 
to 
speculate 
about 
the 
conditions 
of 
beings 
that 
are, 
in 
the 
logical 
and 
praxeological 
structure 
of 
their 
minds 
and 
in 
the 
power 
of 
their 
senses, 
essentially 
different 
from 
man 
as 
we 
know 
him 
and 
as 
we 
are 
ourselves. 
Nietzsche’s 
concept 
of 
a 
superman 
is 
devoid 
of 
any 
epistemological 
meaning. 


2. 
On 
Action 
Epistemology 
deals 
with 
the 
mental 
phenomena 
of 
human 
life, 
with 
man 
as 
he 
thinks 
and 
acts. 
The 
main 
deficiency 
of 
traditional 
epistemological 
attempts 
is 
to 
be 
seen 
in 
their 
neglect 
of 
the 
praxeological 
aspects. 
The 
epistemologists 
dealt 
with 
thinking 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
separate 
field 
cut 
off 
from 
other 
manifestations 
of 
human 
endeavor. 
They 
dealt 
with 
the 
problems 
of 
logic 
and 
mathematics, 
but 
they 
failed 
to 
see 
the 
practical 
aspects 
of 
thinking. 
They 
ignored 
the 
praxeological 
a 
priori. 


The 
shortcomings 
of 
this 
approach 
became 
manifest 
in 
the 
teachings 
of 
natural 
theology 
as 
distinguished 
from 
revealed 
theology. 
Natural 
theology 
saw 
the 
characteristic 
mark 
of 
deity 
in 
freedom 
from 
the 
limitations 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
and 
the 
human 
will. 
Deity 
is 
omniscient 
and 
almighty. 
But 
in 
elaborating 
these 
ideas 
the 
philosophers 
failed 
to 
see 
that 
a 
concept 
of 
deity 
that 
implies 
an 
acting 
God, 
that 
is, 
a 
God 
behaving 
in 
the 
way 
man 
behaves 
in 
acting, 
is 
self-contradictory. 
Man 
acts 
because 
he 
is 
dissatisfied 
with 
the 
state 
of 
affairs 
as 
it 
prevails 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
his 
intervention. 
Man 
acts 
because 
he 
lacks 
the 
power 
to 
render 
conditions 
fully 
satisfactory 
and 
must 
resort 
to 
appropriate 
means 
in 
order 
to 
render 
them 
less 
unsatisfactory. 
But 
for 
an 
almighty 
supreme 
being 
there 
cannot 
be 
any 
dissatisfaction 
with 
the 
prevailing 
state 
of 
affairs. 
The 
Almighty 
does 
not 
act, 
because 
there 
is 
no 
state 
of 
affairs 
that 
he 
cannot 
render 
fully 
satisfactory 
without 
any 
action, 
i.e., 
without 
resorting 
to 
any 
means. 
For 
Him 
there 
is 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
a 
distinction 
between 
ends 
and 
means. 
It 
is 
anthropomorphism 
to 
ascribe 
action 
to 
God. 
Starting 
from 
the 
limitations 
of 
his 
human 
nature, 
man’s 
discursive 



reasoning 
can 
never 
circumscribe 
and 
define 
the 
essence 
of 
omnipotence. 


However, 
it 
must 
be 
emphasized 
that 
what 
prevented 
people 
from 
paying 
attention 
to 
the 
praxeological 
issues 
was 
not 
theological 
considerations. 
It 
was 
the 
passionate 
longing 
for 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
Utopian 
chimera 
of 
the 
land 
of 
Cockaigne. 
As 
the 
science 
of 
economics, 
the 
up-to-now 
best 
elaborated 
part 
of 
praxeology, 
exploded 
the 
fallacies 
of 
every 
brand 
of 
utopianism, 
it 
was 
outlawed 
and 
stigmatized 
as 
unscientific. 


The 
most 
characteristic 
trait 
of 
modern 
epistemology 
is 
its 
entire 
neglect 
of 
economics, 
that 
branch 
of 
knowledge 
whose 
development 
and 
practical 
application 
was 
the 
most 
spectacular 
event 
of 
modern 
history. 


3. 
On 
Economics 
The 
study 
of 
economics 
has 
been 
again 
and 
again 
led 
astray 
by 
the 
vain 
idea 
that 
economics 
must 
proceed 
according 
to 
the 
pattern 
of 
other 
sciences. 
The 
mischief 
done 
by 
such 
misconstructions 
cannot 
be 
avoided 
by 
admonishing 
the 
economist 
to 
stop 
casting 
longing 
glances 
upon 
other 
fields 
of 
knowledge 
or 
even 
to 
ignore 
them 
entirely. 
Ignorance, 
whatever 
subject 
it 
may 
concern, 
is 
in 
no 
case 
a 
quality 
that 
could 
be 
useful 
in 
the 
search 
for 
truth. 
What 
is 
needed 
to 
prevent 
a 
scholar 
from 
garbling 
economic 
studies 
by 
resorting 
to 
the 
methods 
of 
mathematics, 
physics, 
biology, 
history 
or 
jurisprudence 
is 
not 
slighting 
and 
neglecting 
these 
sciences, 
but, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
trying 
to 
comprehend 
and 
to 
master 
them. 
He 
who 
wants 
to 
achieve 
anything 
in 
praxeology 
must 
be 
conversant 
with 
mathematics, 
physics, 
biology, 
history, 
and 
jurisprudence, 
lest 
he 
confuse 
the 
tasks 
and 
the 
methods 
of 
the 
theory 
of 
human 
action 
with 
the 
tasks 
and 
the 
methods 
of 
any 
of 
these 
other 
branches 
of 
knowledge. 
What 
was 
wrong 
with 
the 
various 
Historical 
Schools 
of 
economics 
was 
first 
of 
all 
that 
their 
adepts 
were 
merely 
dilettantes 
in 
the 
field 
of 
history. 
No 
competent 
mathematician 
can 
fail 
to 
see 
through 
the 
fundamental 
fallacies 
of 
all 
varieties 
of 
what 
is 
called 
mathematical 
economics 
and 
especially 
of 
econometrics. 
No 
biologist 
was 
ever 
fooled 
by 
the 
rather 
amateurish 
organicism 
of 
such 
authors 
as 
Paul 
de 
Lilienfeld. 


When 
I 
once 
expressed 
this 
opinion 
in 
a 
lecture, 
a 
young 
man 
in 
the 
audience 
objected. 
“You 
are 
asking 
too 
much 
of 
an 
economist,” 
he 
observed; 
“nobody 
can 
force 
me 
to 
employ 
my 
time 
in 
studying 
all 
these 
sciences.” 
My 
answer 
was: 
“Nobody 
asks 
or 
forces 
you 
to 
become 
an 
economist.” 



4. 
The 
Starting 
Point 
of 
Praxeological 
Thinking 
The 
a 
priori 
knowledge 
of 
praxeology 
is 
entirely 
different—categorially 
different—from 
the 
a 
priori 
knowledge 
of 
mathematics 
or, 
more 
precisely, 
from 
mathematical 
a 
priori 
knowledge 
as 
interpreted 
by 
logical 
positivism. 
The 
starting 
point 
of 
all 
praxeological 
thinking 
is 
not 
arbitrarily 
chosen 
axioms, 
but 
a 
self-evident 
proposition, 
fully, 
clearly 
and 
necessarily 
present 
in 
every 
human 
mind. 
An 
unbridgeable 
gulf 
separates 
those 
animals 
in 
whose 
minds 
this 
cognition 
is 
present 
from 
those 
in 
whose 
minds 
it 
is 
not 
fully 
and 
clearly 
present. 
Only 
to 
the 
former 
is 
the 
appellation 
man 
accorded. 
The 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
man 
is 
precisely 
that 
he 
consciously 
acts. 
Man 
is 
Homo 
agens, 
the 
acting 
animal. 


All—apart 
from 
zoology—that 
has 
ever 
been 
scientifically 
stated 
to 
distinguish 
man 
from 
nonhuman 
mammals 
is 
implied 
in 
the 
proposition: 
man 
acts. 
To 
act 
means: 
to 
strive 
after 
ends, 
that 
is, 
to 
choose 
a 
goal 
and 
to 
resort 
to 
means 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
the 
goal 
sought. 


The 
essence 
of 
logical 
positivism 
is 
to 
deny 
the 
cognitive 
value 
of 
a 
priori 
knowledge 
by 
pointing 
out 
that 
all 
a 
priori 
propositions 
are 
merely 
analytic. 
They 
do 
not 
provide 
new 
information, 
but 
are 
merely 
verbal 
or 
tautological, 
asserting 
what 
has 
already 
been 
implied 
in 
the 
definitions 
and 
premises. 
Only 
experience 
can 
lead 
to 
synthetic 
propositions. 
There 
is 
an 
obvious 
objection 
against 
this 
doctrine, 
viz., 
that 
this 
proposition 
that 
there 
are 
no 
synthetic 
a 
priori 
propositions 
is 
in 
itself 
a—as 
the 
present 
writer 
thinks, 
false—synthetic 
a 
priori 
proposition, 
for 
it 
can 
manifestly 
not 
be 
established 
by 
experience. 


The 
whole 
controversy 
is, 
however, 
meaningless 
when 
applied 
to 
praxeology. 
It 
refers 
essentially 
to 
geometry. 
Its 
present 
state, 
especially 
its 
treatment 
by 
logical 
positivism, 
has 
been 
deeply 
influenced 
by 
the 
shock 
that 
Western 
philosophy 
received 
from 
the 
discovery 
of 
non-Euclidian 
geometries. 
Before 
Bolyai 
and 
Lobachevsky, 
geometry 
was, 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
philosophers, 
the 
paragon 
of 
perfect 
science; 
it 
was 
assumed 
that 
it 
provided 
unshakable 
certainty 
forever 
and 
for 
everybody. 
To 
proceed 
also 
in 
other 
branches 
of 
knowledge 
more 
geometrico 
was 
the 
great 
ideal 
of 
truth-
seekers. 
All 
traditional 
epistemological 
concepts 
began 
to 
totter 
when 
the 
attempts 
to 
construct 
non-Euclidian 
geometries 
succeeded. 


Yet 
praxeology 
is 
not 
geometry. 
It 
is 
the 
worst 
of 
all 
superstitions 
to 
assume 
that 
the 
epistemological 
characteristics 
of 
one 
branch 
of 
knowledge 



must 
necessarily 
be 
applicable 
to 
any 
other 
branch. 
In 
dealing 
with 
the 
epistemology 
of 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action, 
one 
must 
not 
take 
one’s 
cue 
from 
geometry, 
mechanics, 
or 
any 
other 
science. 


The 
assumptions 
of 
Euclid 
were 
once 
considered 
as 
self-evidently 
true. 
Present-day 
epistemology 
looks 
upon 
them 
as 
freely 
chosen 
postulates, 
the 
starting 
point 
of 
a 
hypothetical 
chain 
of 
reasoning. 
Whatever 
this 
may 
mean, 
it 
has 
no 
reference 
at 
all 
to 
the 
problems 
of 
praxeology. 


The 
starting 
point 
of 
praxeology 
is 
a 
self-evident 
truth, 
the 
cognition 
of 
action, 
that 
is, 
the 
cognition 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
is 
such 
a 
thing 
as 
consciously 
aiming 
at 
ends. 
There 
is 
no 
use 
cavilling 
about 
these 
words 
by 
referring 
to 
philosophical 
problems 
that 
have 
no 
bearing 
upon 
our 
problem. 
The 
truth 
of 
this 
cognition 
is 
as 
self-evident 
and 
as 
indispensable 
for 
the 
human 
mind 
as 
is 
the 
distinction 
between 
A 
and 
non-A. 


5. 
The 
Reality 
of 
the 
External 
World 
From 
the 
praxeological 
point 
of 
view 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
question 
the 
real 
existence 
of 
matter, 
of 
physical 
objects 
and 
of 
the 
external 
world. 
Their 
reality 
is 
revealed 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
man 
is 
not 
omnipotent. 
There 
is 
in 
the 
world 
something 
that 
offers 
resistance 
to 
the 
realization 
of 
his 
wishes 
and 
desires. 
Any 
attempt 
to 
remove 
by 
a 
mere 
fiat 
what 
annoys 
him 
and 
to 
substitute 
a 
state 
of 
affairs 
that 
suits 
him 
better 
for 
a 
state 
of 
affairs 
that 
suits 
him 
less 
is 
vain. 
If 
he 
wants 
to 
succeed, 
he 
must 
proceed 
according 
to 
methods 
that 
are 
adjusted 
to 
the 
structure 
of 
something 
about 
which 
perception 
provides 
him 
with 
some 
information. 
We 
may 
define 
the 
external 
world 
as 
the 
totality 
of 
all 
those 
things 
and 
events 
that 
determine 
the 
feasibility 
or 
unfeasibility, 
the 
success 
of 
failure, 
of 
human 
action. 


The 
much 
discussed 
question 
whether 
physical 
objects 
can 
or 
cannot 
be 
conceived 
as 
existing 
independently 
of 
the 
mind 
is 
vain. 
For 
thousands 
of 
years 
the 
minds 
of 
physicians 
did 
not 
perceive 
germs 
and 
did 
not 
divine 
their 
existence. 
But 
the 
success 
or 
failure 
of 
their 
endeavors 
to 
preserve 
their 
patients’ 
health 
and 
lives 
depended 
on 
the 
way 
germs 
influenced 
or 
did 
not 
influence 
the 
functioning 
of 
the 
patients’ 
bodily 
organs. 
The 
germs 
were 
real 
because 
they 
conditioned 
the 
outcome 
of 
events 
either 
by 
interfering 
or 
by 
not 
interfering, 
either 
by 
being 
present 
in 
or 
by 
being 
absent 
from 
the 
field. 


6. 
Causality 
and 
Teleology 

Action 
is 
a 
category 
that 
the 
natural 
sciences 
do 
not 
take 
into 
account. 
The 
scientist 
acts 
in 
embarking 
upon 
his 
research 
work, 
but 
in 
the 
orbit 
of 
natural 
events 
of 
the 
external 
world 
which 
he 
explores 
there 
is 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
action. 
There 
is 
agitation, 
there 
is 
stimulus 
and 
response, 
and, 
whatever 
some 
philosophers 
may 
object, 
there 
is 
cause 
and 
effect. 
There 
is 
what 
appears 
to 
be 
an 
inexorable 
regularity 
in 
the 
concatenation 
and 
sequence 
of 
phenomena. 
There 
are 
constant 
relations 
between 
entities 
that 
enable 
the 
scientist 
to 
establish 
the 
process 
called 
measurement. 
But 
there 
is 
nothing 
that 
would 
suggest 
aiming 
at 
ends 
sought; 
there 
is 
no 
ascertainable 
purpose. 


The 
natural 
sciences 
are 
causality 
research; 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
are 
teleological. 
In 
establishing 
this 
distinction 
between 
the 
two 
fields 
of 
human 
knowledge, 
we 
do 
not 
express 
any 
opinion 
concerning 
the 
question 
whether 
the 
course 
of 
all 
cosmic 
events 
is 
or 
is 
not 
ultimately 
determined 
by 
a 
superhuman 
being’s 
design. 
The 
treatment 
of 
this 
great 
problem 
transcends 
the 
range 
of 
man’s 
reason 
and 
is 
outside 
the 
domain 
of 
any 
human 
science. 
It 
is 
in 
the 
realm 
that 
metaphysics 
and 
theology 
claim 
for 
themselves. 


The 
purpose 
to 
which 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
refer 
is 
not 
the 
plans 
and 
ways 
of 
God, 
but 
the 
ends 
sought 
by 
acting 
men 
in 
the 
pursuit 
of 
their 
own 
designs. 
The 
endeavors 
of 
the 
metaphysical 
discipline 
commonly 
called 
philosophy 
of 
history 
to 
reveal 
in 
the 
flux 
of 
historical 
events 
the 
hidden 
plans 
of 
God 
or 
of 
some 
mythical 
agency 
(as, 
for 
instance, 
in 
the 
scheme 
of 
Marx, 
the 
material 
productive 
forces) 
are 
not 
science. 


In 
dealing 
with 
a 
definite 
historical 
fact, 
for 
instance 
with 
the 
first 
World 
War, 
the 
historian 
has 
to 
find 
out 
the 
ends 
sought 
by 
the 
various 
individuals 
and 
groups 
of 
individuals 
who 
were 
instrumental 
in 
organizing 
these 
campaigns 
or 
in 
fighting 
the 
aggressors. 
He 
has 
to 
examine 
the 
outcome 
resulting 
from 
the 
actions 
of 
all 
people 
involved 
and 
compare 
it 
with 
the 
preceding 
state 
of 
affairs 
as 
well 
as 
with 
the 
intentions 
of 
the 
actors. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
the 
historian’s 
business 
to 
search 
after 
a 
“higher” 
or 
“deeper” 
sense 
that 
manifested 
itself 
in 
the 
events 
or 
was 
realized 
by 
them. 
Perhaps 
there 
is 
such 
a 
hidden 
“higher” 
or 
“deeper” 
purpose 
or 
significance 
in 
the 
succession 
of 
historical 
events. 
But 
for 
mortal 
man 
there 
is 
no 
way 
open 
to 
learn 
something 
about 
such 
“higher” 
or 
“deeper” 
meanings. 


7. 
The 
Category 
of 
Action 
All 
the 
elements 
of 
the 
theoretical 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
are 
already 



implied 
in 
the 
category 
of 
action 
and 
have 
to 
be 
made 
explicit 
by 
expounding 
its 
contents. 
As 
among 
these 
elements 
of 
teleology 
is 
also 
the 
category 
of 
causality, 
the 
category 
of 
action 
is 
the 
fundamental 
category 
of 
epistemology, 
the 
starting 
point 
of 
any 
epistemological 
analysis. 


The 
very 
category 
or 
concept 
of 
action 
comprehends 
the 
concepts 
of 
means 
and 
ends, 
of 
preferring 
and 
putting 
aside, 
viz., 
of 
valuing, 
of 
success 
and 
failure, 
of 
profit 
and 
loss, 
of 
costs. 
As 
no 
action 
could 
be 
devised 
and 
ventured 
upon 
without 
definite 
ideas 
about 
the 
relation 
of 
cause 
and 
effect, 
teleology 
presupposes 
causality. 


Animals 
are 
forced 
to 
adjust 
themselves 
to 
the 
natural 
conditions 
of 
their 
environment; 
if 
they 
do 
not 
succeed 
in 
this 
process 
of 
adjustment, 
they 
are 
wiped 
out. 
Man 
is 
the 
only 
animal 
that 
is 
able—within 
definite 
limits—to 
adjust 
his 
environment 
purposively 
to 
suit 
him 
better. 


We 
can 
think 
of 
the 
evolutionary 
process 
that 
transformed 
the 
nonhuman 
ancestors 
of 
mankind 
into 
human 
beings 
as 
a 
succession 
of 
small, 
gradual 
changes 
spread 
over 
millions 
of 
years. 
But 
we 
cannot 
think 
of 
a 
mind 
in 
which 
the 
category 
of 
action 
would 
have 
been 
present 
only 
in 
an 
incomplete 
form. 
There 
is 
nothing 
in 
between 
a 
being 
driven 
exclusively 
by 
instincts 
and 
physiological 
impulses 
and 
a 
being 
that 
chooses 
ends 
and 
the 
means 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
these 
ends. 
We 
cannot 
think 
of 
an 
acting 
being 
that 
would 
not 
in 
concreto 
distinguish 
what 
is 
end 
and 
what 
is 
means, 
what 
is 
success 
and 
what 
is 
failure, 
what 
he 
likes 
more 
and 
what 
he 
likes 
less, 
what 
is 
his 
profit 
or 
his 
loss 
derived 
from 
the 
action 
and 
what 
his 
costs 
are. 
In 
grasping 
all 
these 
things, 
he 
may, 
of 
course, 
err 
in 
his 
judgments 
concerning 
the 
role 
various 
external 
events 
and 
materials 
play 
in 
the 
structure 
of 
his 
action. 


A 
definite 
mode 
of 
behavior 
is 
an 
action 
only 
if 
these 
distinctions 
are 
present 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
man 
concerned. 


8. 
The 
Sciences 
of 
Human 
Action 
The 
German 
language 
has 
developed 
a 
term 
that 
would 
have 
been 
expedient 
to 
denote 
the 
totality 
of 
the 
sciences 
dealing 
with 
human 
action 
as 
distinguished 
from 
the 
natural 
sciences, 
viz., 
the 
term 
Geisteswissenschaften. 
Unfortunately 
some 
authors 
have 
heavily 
loaded 
this 
term 
with 
metaphysical 
and 
mystical 
implications 
that 
detract 
from 
its 
usefulness. 
In 
English 
the 
term 
pneumatology 
(suggested 
by 
Bentham2 
as 
the 
opposite 
of 
somatology) 
would 



have 
served 
the 
purpose, 
but 
it 
was 
never 
accepted. 
The 
term 
moral 
sciences 
as 
employed 
by 
John 
Stuart 
Mill 
is 
unsatisfactory 
on 
account 
of 
its 
etymological 
affinity 
with 
the 
normative 
discipline 
of 
ethics. 
The 
term 
humanities 
is 
traditionally 
employed 
exclusively 
for 
the 
historical 
branches 
of 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action. 
Thus 
we 
are 
forced 
to 
employ 
the 
rather 
heavy 
term 
“sciences 
of 
human 
action.”

The 
Human 
Mind 


1. 
The 
Logical 
Structure 
of 
the 
Human 
Mind 
On 
the 
earth 
man 
occupies 
a 
peculiar 
position 
that 
distinguishes 
him 
from 
and 
elevates 
him 
above 
all 
other 
entities 
constituting 
our 
planet. 
While 
all 
the 
other 
things, 
animate 
or 
inanimate, 
behave 
according 
to 
regular 
patterns, 
man 
alone 
seems 
to 
enjoy—within 
definite 
limits—a 
modicum 
of 
freedom. 
Man 
meditates 
about 
the 
conditions 
of 
his 
own 
self 
and 
of 
his 
environment, 
devises 
states 
of 
affairs 
that, 
as 
he 
believes, 
would 
suit 
him 
better 
than 
the 
existing 
states, 
and 
aims 
by 
purposive 
conduct 
at 
the 
substitution 
of 
a 
more 
desired 
state 
for 
a 
less 
desired 
that 
would 
prevail 
if 
he 
were 
not 
to 
interfere. 


There 
is 
within 
the 
infinite 
expanse 
of 
what 
is 
called 
the 
universe 
or 
nature 
a 
small 
field 
in 
which 
man’s 
conscious 
conduct 
can 
influence 
the 
course 
of 
events. 


It 
is 
this 
fact 
that 
induces 
man 
to 
distinguish 
between 
an 
external 
world 
subject 
to 
inexorable 
and 
inextricable 
necessity 
and 
his 
human 
faculty 
of 
thinking, 
cognizing, 
and 
acting. 
Mind 
or 
reason 
is 
contrasted 
with 
matter, 
the 
will 
with 
self-acting 
impulses, 
instincts, 
and 
physiological 
processes. 
Fully 
aware 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
his 
own 
body 
is 
subject 
to 
the 
same 
forces 
that 
determine 
all 
other 
things 
and 
beings, 
man 
imputes 
his 
ability 
to 
think, 
to 
will 
and 
to 
act 
to 
an 
invisible 
and 
intangible 
factor 
he 
calls 
his 
mind. 


There 
were 
in 
the 
early 
history 
of 
mankind 
attempts 
to 
ascribe 
such 
a 
faculty 
of 
thinking 
and 
purposively 
aiming 
at 
ends 
chosen 
to 
many 
or 
even 
to 
all 
nonhuman 
things. 
Later 
people 
discovered 
that 
it 
was 
vain 
to 
deal 
with 
nonhuman 
things 
as 
if 
they 
were 
endowed 
with 
something 
analogous 
to 
the 



human 
mind. 
Then 
the 
opposite 
tendency 
developed. 
People 
tried 
to 
reduce 
mental 
phenomena 
to 
the 
operation 
of 
factors 
that 
were 
not 
specifically 
human. 
The 
most 
radical 
expression 
of 
this 
doctrine 
was 
already 
implied 
in 
the 
famous 
dictum 
of 
John 
Locke 
according 
to 
which 
the 
mind 
is 
a 
sheet 
of 
white 
paper 
upon 
which 
the 
external 
world 
writes 
its 
own 
story. 


A 
new 
epistemology 
of 
rationalism 
aimed 
at 
the 
refutation 
of 
this 
integral 
empiricism. 
Leibniz 
added 
to 
the 
doctrine 
that 
nothing 
is 
in 
the 
intellect 
that 
has 
not 
previously 
been 
in 
the 
senses 
the 
proviso: 
except 
the 
intellect 
itself. 
Kant, 
awakened 
by 
Hume 
from 
his 
“dogmatic 
slumbers,” 
put 
the 
rationalistic 
doctrine 
upon 
a 
new 
basis. 
Experience, 
he 
taught, 
provides 
only 
the 
raw 
material 
out 
of 
which 
the 
mind 
forms 
what 
is 
called 
knowledge. 
All 
knowledge 
is 
conditioned 
by 
the 
categories 
that 
precede 
any 
data 
of 
experience 
both 
in 
time 
and 
in 
logic. 
The 
categories 
are 
a 
priori; 
they 
are 
the 
mental 
equipment 
of 
the 
individual 
that 
enables 
him 
to 
think 
and—we 
may 
add—to 
act. 
As 
all 
reasoning 
presupposes 
the 
a 
priori 
categories, 
it 
is 
vain 
to 
embark 
upon 
attempts 
to 
prove 
or 
to 
disprove 
them. 


The 
empiricist 
reaction 
against 
apriorism 
centers 
around 
a 
misleading 
interpretation 
of 
the 
non-Euclidean 
geometries, 
the 
nineteenth 
century’s 
most 
important 
contribution 
to 
mathematics. 
It 
stresses 
the 
arbitrary 
character 
of 
axioms 
and 
premises 
and 
the 
tautological 
character 
of 
deductive 
reasoning. 
Deduction, 
it 
teaches, 
cannot 
add 
anything 
to 
our 
knowledge 
of 
reality. 
It 
merely 
makes 
explicit 
what 
was 
already 
implicit 
in 
the 
premises. 
As 
these 
premises 
are 
merely 
products 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
not 
derived 
from 
experience, 
what 
is 
deduced 
from 
them 
cannot 
assert 
anything 
about 
the 
state 
of 
the 
universe. 
What 
logic, 
mathematics, 
and 
other 
aprioristic 
deductive 
theories 
bring 
forward 
are 
at 
best 
convenient 
or 
handy 
tools 
for 
scientific 
operations. 
It 
is 
one 
of 
the 
tasks 
incumbent 
upon 
the 
scientist 
to 
choose 
for 
his 
work 
out 
of 
the 
multiplicity 
of 
the 
various 
existing 
systems 
of 
logic, 
geometry, 
and 
algebra 
the 
system 
that 
is 
most 
convenient 
for 
his 
specific 
purpose.1 
The 
axioms 
from 
which 
a 
deductive 
system 
departs 
are 
arbitrarily 
selected. 
They 
do 
not 
tell 
us 
anything 
about 
reality. 
There 
is 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
first 
principles 
a 
priori 
given 
to 
the 
human 
mind.2 
Such 
is 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
famous 
“Vienna 
Circle” 
and 
of 
other 
contemporary 
schools 
of 
radical 
empiricism 
and 
logical 
positivism. 


In 
order 
to 
examine 
this 
philosophy, 
let 
us 
refer 
to 
the 
conflict 
between 
the 
Euclidian 
geometry 
and 
the 
non-Euclidian 
geometries 
which 
gave 
rise 
to 
these 
controversies. 
It 
is 
an 
undeniable 
fact 
that 
technological 
planning 



guided 
by 
the 
Euclidian 
system 
resulted 
in 
effects 
that 
had 
to 
be 
expected 
according 
to 
the 
inferences 
derived 
from 
this 
system. 
The 
buildings 
do 
not 
collapse, 
and 
the 
machines 
run 
in 
the 
expected 
way. 
The 
practical 
engineer 
cannot 
deny 
that 
this 
geometry 
aided 
him 
in 
his 
endeavors 
to 
divert 
events 
of 
the 
real 
external 
world 
from 
the 
course 
they 
would 
have 
taken 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
his 
intervention 
and 
to 
direct 
them 
towards 
goals 
that 
he 
wanted 
to 
attain. 
He 
must 
conclude 
that 
this 
geometry, 
although 
based 
upon 
definite 
a 
priori 
ideas, 
affirms 
something 
about 
reality 
and 
nature. 
The 
pragmatist 
cannot 
help 
admitting 
that 
Euclidian 
geometry 
works 
in 
the 
same 
way 
in 
which 
all 
a 
posteriori 
knowledge 
provided 
by 
the 
experimental 
natural 
sciences 
works. 
Aside 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
arrangement 
of 
laboratory 
experiments 
already 
presupposes 
and 
implies 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
Euclidian 
scheme, 
we 
must 
not 
forget 
that 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
George 
Washington 
bridge 
over 
the 
Hudson 
River 
and 
many 
thousand 
other 
bridges 
render 
the 
services 
the 
constructors 
wanted 
to 
get 
confirms 
the 
practical 
truth 
not 
only 
of 
the 
applied 
teachings 
of 
physics, 
chemistry, 
and 
metallurgy, 
but 
no 
less 
of 
those 
of 
the 
geometry 
of 
Euclid. 
This 
means 
that 
the 
axioms 
from 
which 
Euclid 
starts 
tell 
us 
something 
about 
the 
external 
world 
that 
to 
our 
mind 
must 
appear 
no 
less 
“true” 
than 
the 
teachings 
of 
the 
experimental 
natural 
sciences. 


The 
critics 
of 
apriorism 
refer 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
certain 
problems 
recourse 
to 
one 
of 
the 
non-Euclidian 
geometries 
appears 
more 
convenient 
than 
recourse 
to 
the 
Euclidian 
system. 
The 
solid 
bodies 
and 
light 
rays 
of 
our 
environment, 
says 
Reichenbach, 
behave 
according 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
Euclid. 
But 
this, 
he 
adds, 
is 
merely 
“a 
fortunate 
empirical 
fact.” 
Beyond 
the 
space 
of 
our 
environment 
the 
physical 
world 
behaves 
according 
to 
other 
geometries.3 
There 
is 
no 
need 
to 
argue 
this 
point. 
For 
these 
other 
geometries 
also 
start 
from 
a 
priori 
axioms, 
not 
from 
experimental 
facts. 
What 
the 
panempiricists 
fail 
to 
explain 
is 
how 
a 
deductive 
theory, 
starting 
from 
allegedly 
arbitrary 
postulates, 
renders 
valuable, 
even 
indispensable, 
services 
in 
the 
endeavors 
to 
describe 
correctly 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
external 
world 
and 
to 
deal 
with 
them 
successfully. 


The 
fortunate 
empirical 
fact 
to 
which 
Reichenbach 
refers 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
human 
mind 
has 
the 
ability 
to 
develop 
theories 
which, 
although 
a 
priori, 
are 
instrumental 
in 
the 
endeavors 
to 
construct 
any 
a 
posteriori 
system 
of 
knowledge. 
Although 
logic, 
mathematics, 
and 
praxeology 
are 
not 
derived 
from 
experience, 
they 
are 
not 
arbitrarily 
made, 
but 
imposed 
upon 
us 
by 
the 
world 
in 
which 
we 
live 
and 
act 
and 
which 
we 
want 
to 
study.4 
They 
are 
not 



empty, 
not 
meaningless, 
and 
not 
merely 
verbal. 
They 
are—for 
man—the 
most 
general 
laws 
of 
the 
universe, 
and 
without 
them 
no 
knowledge 
would 
be 
accessible 
to 
man. 


The 
a 
priori 
categories 
are 
the 
endowment 
that 
enables 
man 
to 
attain 
all 
that 
is 
specifically 
human 
and 
distinguishes 
him 
from 
all 
other 
beings. 
Their 
analysis 
is 
analysis 
of 
the 
human 
condition, 
the 
role 
man 
plays 
in 
the 
universe. 
They 
are 
the 
force 
that 
enables 
man 
to 
create 
and 
to 
produce 
all 
that 
is 
called 
human 
civilization. 


2. 
A 
Hypothesis 
about 
the 
Origin 
of 
A 
Priori 
Categories 
The 
concepts 
of 
natural 
selection 
and 
evolution 
make 
it 
possible 
to 
develop 
a 
hypothesis 
about 
the 
emergence 
of 
the 
logical 
structure 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
and 
the 
a 
priori. 


Animals 
are 
driven 
by 
impulses 
and 
instincts. 
Natural 
selection 
eliminated 
those 
specimens 
and 
species 
which 
developed 
instincts 
that 
were 
a 
liability 
in 
the 
struggle 
for 
survival. 
Only 
those 
endowed 
with 
impulses 
serviceable 
to 
their 
preservation 
survived 
and 
could 
propagate 
their 
species. 


We 
are 
not 
prevented 
from 
assuming 
that 
in 
the 
long 
way 
that 
led 
from 
the 
nonhuman 
ancestors 
of 
man 
to 
the 
emergence 
of 
the 
species 
Homo 
sapiens 
some 
groups 
of 
advanced 
anthropoids 
experimented, 
as 
it 
were, 
with 
categorial 
concepts 
different 
from 
those 
of 
Homo 
sapiens 
and 
tried 
to 
use 
them 
for 
the 
guidance 
of 
their 
conduct. 
But 
as 
such 
pseudo 
categories 
were 
not 
adjusted 
to 
the 
conditions 
of 
reality, 
behavior 
directed 
by 
a 
quasi 
reasoning 
based 
upon 
them 
was 
bound 
to 
fail 
and 
to 
spell 
disaster 
to 
those 
committed 
to 
it. 
Only 
those 
groups 
could 
survive 
whose 
members 
acted 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
right 
categories, 
i.e., 
with 
those 
that 
were 
in 
conformity 
with 
reality 
and 
therefore—to 
use 
the 
concept 
of 
pragmatism—worked.5 


However, 
reference 
to 
this 
interpretation 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
a 
priori 
categories 
does 
not 
entitle 
us 
to 
call 
them 
a 
precipitate 
of 
experience, 
of 
a 
prehuman 
and 
prelogical 
experience 
as 
it 
were.6 
We 
must 
not 
blot 
out 
the 
fundamental 
difference 
between 
finality 
and 
the 
absence 
of 
finality. 


The 
Darwinian 
concept 
of 
natural 
selection 
tries 
to 
explain 
phylogenetic 
change 
without 
recourse 
to 
finality 
as 
a 
natural 
phenomenon. 
Natural 
selection 
is 
operative 
not 
only 
without 
any 
purposive 
interference 
on 
the 
part 
of 
external 
elements; 
it 
operates 
also 
without 
any 
intentional 
behavior 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
various 
specimens 
concerned. 



Experience 
is 
a 
mental 
act 
on 
the 
part 
of 
thinking 
and 
acting 
men. 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
assign 
to 
it 
any 
role 
in 
a 
purely 
natural 
chain 
of 
causation 
the 
characteristic 
mark 
of 
which 
is 
the 
absence 
of 
intentional 
behavior. 
It 
is 
logically 
impossible 
to 
compromise 
between 
design 
and 
the 
absence 
of 
design. 
Those 
primates 
who 
had 
the 
serviceable 
categories 
survived, 
not 
because, 
having 
had 
the 
experience 
that 
their 
categories 
were 
serviceable, 
they 
decided 
to 
cling 
to 
them. 
They 
survived 
because 
they 
did 
not 
resort 
to 
other 
categories 
that 
would 
have 
resulted 
in 
their 
own 
extirpation. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
in 
which 
the 
evolutionary 
process 
eliminated 
all 
other 
groups 
whose 
individuals, 
because 
of 
specific 
properties 
of 
their 
bodies, 
were 
not 
fit 
for 
life 
under 
the 
special 
conditions 
of 
their 
environment, 
it 
eliminated 
also 
those 
groups 
whose 
minds 
developed 
in 
a 
way 
that 
made 
their 
use 
for 
the 
guidance 
of 
conduct 
pernicious. 


The 
a 
priori 
categories 
are 
not 
innate 
ideas. 
What 
the 
normal—healthy— 
child 
inherits 
from 
his 
parents 
are 
not 
any 
categories, 
ideas, 
or 
concepts, 
but 
the 
human 
mind 
that 
has 
the 
capacity 
to 
learn 
and 
to 
conceive 
ideas, 
the 
capacity 
to 
make 
its 
bearer 
behave 
as 
a 
human 
being, 
i.e., 
to 
act. 


However 
we 
may 
think 
about 
this 
problem, 
one 
thing 
is 
certain. 
Since 
the 
a 
priori 
categories 
emanating 
from 
the 
logical 
structure 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
have 
enabled 
man 
to 
develop 
theories 
the 
practical 
application 
of 
which 
has 
aided 
him 
in 
his 
endeavors 
to 
hold 
his 
own 
in 
the 
struggle 
for 
survival 
and 
to 
attain 
various 
ends 
that 
he 
wanted 
to 
attain, 
these 
categories 
provide 
some 
information 
about 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
universe. 
They 
are 
not 
merely 
arbitrary 
assumptions 
without 
any 
informative 
value, 
not 
mere 
conventions 
that 
could 
as 
well 
be 
replaced 
by 
some 
other 
conventions. 
They 
are 
the 
necessary 
mental 
tool 
to 
arrange 
sense 
data 
in 
a 
systematic 
way, 
to 
transform 
them 
into 
facts 
of 
experience, 
then 
these 
facts 
into 
bricks 
to 
build 
theories, 
and 
finally 
the 
theories 
into 
technics 
to 
attain 
ends 
aimed 
at. 


The 
animals 
too 
are 
equipped 
with 
senses; 
some 
of 
them 
are 
even 
capable 
of 
sensing 
stimuli 
that 
do 
not 
affect 
man’s 
senses. 
What 
prevents 
them 
from 
taking 
advantage 
of 
what 
their 
senses 
convey 
to 
them 
in 
the 
way 
man 
does, 
is 
not 
an 
inferiority 
of 
their 
sense 
equipment, 
but 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
lack 
what 
is 
called 
the 
human 
mind 
with 
its 
logical 
structure, 
its 
a 
priori 
categories. 


Theory 
as 
distinct 
from 
history 
is 
the 
search 
for 
constant 
relations 
between 
entities 
or, 
what 
means 
the 
same, 
for 
regularity 
in 
the 
succession 
of 
events. 
In 
establishing 
epistemology 
as 
a 
theory 
of 
knowledge, 
the 



philosopher 
implicitly 
assumes 
or 
asserts 
that 
there 
is 
in 
the 
intellectual 
effort 
of 
man 
something 
that 
remains 
unchanged, 
viz., 
the 
logical 
structure 
of 
the 
human 
mind. 


If 
there 
were 
nothing 
permanent 
in 
the 
manifestations 
of 
the 
human 
mind, 
there 
could 
not 
be 
any 
theory 
of 
knowledge, 
but 
merely 
a 
historical 
account 
of 
the 
various 
attempts 
made 
by 
men 
to 
acquire 
knowledge. 
The 
condition 
of 
epistemology 
would 
resemble 
that 
of 
the 
various 
branches 
of 
history, 
e.g., 
what 
is 
called 
political 
science. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
in 
which 
political 
science 
merely 
records 
what 
has 
been 
done 
or 
has 
been 
suggested 
in 
its 
field 
in 
the 
past, 
but 
is 
at 
a 
loss 
to 
tell 
anything 
about 
invariant 
relations 
among 
the 
elements 
with 
which 
it 
deals, 
epistemology 
would 
have 
to 
restrict 
its 
work 
to 
the 
assemblage 
of 
historical 
data 
about 
the 
mental 
activities 
of 
the 
past. 


In 
stressing 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
logical 
structure 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
is 
common 
to 
all 
specimens 
of 
the 
species 
Homo 
sapiens, 
we 
do 
not 
want 
to 
assert 
that 
this 
human 
mind 
as 
we 
know 
it 
is 
the 
only 
or 
the 
best 
possible 
mental 
tool 
that 
could 
be 
devised 
or 
that 
has 
ever 
been 
and 
will 
ever 
be 
called 
into 
existence. 
In 
epistemology, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
all 
other 
sciences, 
we 
are 
dealing 
neither 
with 
eternity 
nor 
with 
conditions 
in 
parts 
of 
the 
universe 
from 
which 
no 
sign 
reaches 
our 
orbit 
nor 
with 
what 
may 
possibly 
happen 
in 
future 
aeons. 
Perhaps 
there 
are 
somewhere 
in 
the 
infinite 
universe 
beings 
whose 
minds 
outrank 
our 
minds 
to 
the 
same 
extent 
as 
our 
minds 
surpass 
those 
of 
the 
insects. 
Perhaps 
there 
will 
once 
somewhere 
live 
beings 
who 
will 
look 
upon 
us 
with 
the 
same 
condescension 
as 
we 
look 
upon 
amoebae. 
But 
scientific 
thinking 
cannot 
indulge 
in 
such 
imagery. 
It 
is 
bound 
to 
limit 
itself 
to 
what 
is 
accessible 
to 
the 
human 
mind 
as 
it 
is. 


3. 
The 
A 
Priori 
One 
does 
not 
annul 
the 
cognitive 
significance 
of 
the 
a 
priori 
by 
qualifying 
it 
as 
tautological. 
A 
tautology 
must 
ex 
definitione 
be 
the 
tautology 
—restatement—of 
something 
said 
already 
previously. 
If 
we 
qualify 
Euclidian 
geometry 
as 
a 
hierarchical 
system 
of 
tautologies, 
we 
may 
say: 
The 
theorem 
of 
Pythagoras 
is 
tautological 
as 
it 
expresses 
merely 
something 
that 
is 
already 
implied 
in 
the 
definition 
of 
a 
right-angled 
triangle. 


But 
the 
question 
is: 
How 
did 
we 
get 
the 
first—the 
basic—proposition 
of 
which 
the 
second—the 
derived—proposition 
is 
merely 
a 
tautology? 
In 
the 



case 
of 
the 
various 
geometries 
the 
answers 
given 
today 
are 
either 
(a) 
by 
an 
arbitrary 
choice 
or 
(b) 
on 
account 
of 
its 
convenience 
or 
suitability. 
Such 
an 
answer 
cannot 
be 
given 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
category 
of 
action. 


Neither 
can 
we 
interpret 
our 
concept 
of 
action 
as 
a 
precipitate 
of 
experience. 
It 
makes 
sense 
to 
speak 
of 
experience 
in 
cases 
in 
which 
also 
something 
different 
from 
what 
was 
experienced 
in 
concreto 
could 
have 
possibly 
been 
expected 
before 
the 
experience. 
Experience 
tells 
us 
something 
we 
did 
not 
know 
before 
and 
could 
not 
learn 
but 
for 
having 
had 
the 
experience. 
But 
the 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
a 
priori 
knowledge 
is 
that 
we 
cannot 
think 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
its 
negation 
or 
of 
something 
that 
would 
be 
at 
variance 
with 
it. 
What 
the 
a 
priori 
expresses 
is 
necessarily 
implied 
in 
every 
proposition 
concerning 
the 
issue 
in 
question. 
It 
is 
implied 
in 
all 
our 
thinking 
and 
acting. 


If 
we 
qualify 
a 
concept 
or 
a 
proposition 
as 
a 
priori, 
we 
want 
to 
say: 
first, 
that 
the 
negation 
of 
what 
it 
asserts 
is 
unthinkable 
for 
the 
human 
mind 
and 
appears 
to 
it 
as 
nonsense; 
secondly, 
that 
this 
a 
priori 
concept 
or 
proposition 
is 
necessarily 
implied 
in 
our 
mental 
approach 
to 
all 
the 
problems 
concerned, 
i.e., 
in 
our 
thinking 
and 
acting 
concerning 
these 
problems. 


The 
a 
priori 
categories 
are 
the 
mental 
equipment 
by 
dint 
of 
which 
man 
is 
able 
to 
think 
and 
to 
experience 
and 
thus 
to 
acquire 
knowledge. 
Their 
truth 
or 
validity 
cannot 
be 
proved 
or 
refuted 
as 
can 
those 
of 
a 
posteriori 
propositions, 
because 
they 
are 
precisely 
the 
instrument 
that 
enables 
us 
to 
distinguish 
what 
is 
true 
or 
valid 
from 
what 
is 
not. 


What 
we 
know 
is 
what 
the 
nature 
or 
structure 
of 
our 
senses 
and 
of 
our 
mind 
makes 
comprehensible 
to 
us. 
We 
see 
reality, 
not 
as 
it 
“is” 
and 
may 
appear 
to 
a 
perfect 
being, 
but 
only 
as 
the 
quality 
of 
our 
mind 
and 
of 
our 
senses 
enables 
us 
to 
see 
it. 
Radical 
empiricism 
and 
positivism 
do 
not 
want 
to 
admit 
this. 
As 
they 
describe 
it, 
reality 
writes, 
as 
experience, 
its 
own 
story 
upon 
the 
white 
sheets 
of 
the 
human 
mind. 
They 
admit 
that 
our 
senses 
are 
imperfect 
and 
do 
not 
fully 
and 
faithfully 
reflect 
reality. 
But 
they 
do 
not 
examine 
the 
power 
of 
the 
mind 
to 
produce, 
out 
of 
the 
material 
provided 
by 
sensation, 
an 
undistorted 
representation 
of 
reality. 
In 
dealing 
with 
the 
a 
priori 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
the 
mental 
tools 
that 
enable 
us 
to 
experience, 
to 
learn, 
to 
know, 
and 
to 
act. 
We 
are 
dealing 
with 
the 
mind’s 
power, 
and 
this 
implies 
that 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
the 
limits 
of 
its 
power. 


We 
must 
never 
forget 
that 
our 
representation 
of 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
universe 
is 
conditioned 
by 
the 
structure 
of 
our 
mind 
as 
well 
as 
of 
our 
senses. 



We 
cannot 
preclude 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
there 
are 
features 
of 
reality 
that 
are 
hidden 
to 
our 
mental 
faculties 
but 
could 
be 
noticed 
by 
beings 
equipped 
with 
a 
more 
efficient 
mind 
and 
certainly 
by 
a 
perfect 
being. 
We 
must 
try 
to 
become 
aware 
of 
the 
characteristic 
features 
and 
limitations 
of 
our 
mind 
in 
order 
not 
to 
fall 
prey 
to 
the 
illusion 
of 
omniscience. 


The 
positivistic 
conceit 
of 
some 
of 
the 
forerunners 
of 
modern 
positivism 
manifested 
itself 
most 
blatantly 
in 
the 
dictum: 
God 
is 
a 
mathematician. 
How 
can 
mortals, 
equipped 
with 
manifestly 
imperfect 
senses, 
claim 
for 
their 
mind 
the 
faculty 
of 
conceiving 
the 
universe 
in 
the 
same 
way 
in 
which 
the 
wholly 
perfect 
may 
conceive 
it? 
Man 
cannot 
analyze 
essential 
features 
of 
reality 
without 
the 
help 
provided 
by 
the 
tools 
of 
mathematics. 
But 
the 
perfect 
being? 


After 
all, 
it 
is 
quite 
supererogatory 
to 
waste 
time 
upon 
controversies 
concerning 
the 
a 
priori. 
Nobody 
denies 
or 
could 
deny 
that 
no 
human 
reasoning 
and 
no 
human 
search 
for 
knowledge 
could 
dispense 
with 
what 
these 
a 
priori 
concepts, 
categories, 
and 
propositions 
tell 
us. 
No 
quibbling 
can 
in 
the 
least 
affect 
the 
fundamental 
role 
played 
by 
the 
category 
of 
action 
for 
all 
the 
problems 
of 
the 
science 
of 
man, 
for 
praxeology, 
for 
economics, 
and 
for 
history. 


4. 
The 
A 
Priori 
Representation 
of 
Reality 
No 
thinking 
and 
no 
acting 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
man 
if 
the 
universe 
were 
chaotic, 
i.e., 
if 
there 
were 
no 
regularity 
whatever 
in 
the 
succession 
and 
concatenation 
of 
events. 
In 
such 
a 
world 
of 
unlimited 
contingency 
nothing 
could 
be 
perceived 
but 
ceaseless 
kaleidoscopic 
change. 
There 
would 
be 
no 
possibility 
for 
man 
to 
expect 
anything. 
All 
experience 
would 
be 
merely 
historical, 
the 
record 
of 
what 
has 
happened 
in 
the 
past. 
No 
inference 
from 
past 
events 
to 
what 
might 
happen 
in 
the 
future 
would 
be 
permissible. 
Therefore 
man 
could 
not 
act. 
He 
could 
at 
best 
be 
a 
passive 
spectator 
and 
would 
not 
be 
able 
to 
make 
any 
arrangements 
for 
the 
future, 
be 
it 
only 
for 
the 
future 
of 
the 
impending 
instant. 
The 
first 
and 
basic 
achievement 
of 
thinking 
is 
the 
awareness 
of 
constant 
relations 
among 
the 
external 
phenomena 
that 
affect 
our 
senses. 
A 
bundle 
of 
events 
that 
are 
regularly 
related 
in 
a 
definite 
way 
to 
other 
events 
is 
called 
a 
specific 
thing 
and 
as 
such 
distinguished 
from 
other 
specific 
things. 
The 
starting 
point 
of 
experimental 
knowledge 
is 
the 
cognition 
that 
an 
A 
is 
uniformly 
followed 
by 
a 
B. 
The 
utilization 
of 
this 
knowledge 
either 
for 
the 
production 
of 
B 
or 
for 
the 
avoidance 
of 
the 
emergence 
of 
B 
is 



called 
action. 
The 
primary 
objective 
of 
action 
is 
either 
to 
bring 
about 
B 
or 
to 
prevent 
its 
happening. 


Whatever 
philosophers 
may 
say 
about 
causality, 
the 
fact 
remains 
that 
no 
action 
could 
be 
performed 
by 
men 
not 
guided 
by 
it. 
Neither 
can 
we 
imagine 
a 
mind 
not 
aware 
of 
the 
nexus 
of 
cause 
and 
effect. 
In 
this 
sense 
we 
may 
speak 
of 
causality 
as 
a 
category 
or 
an 
a 
priori 
of 
thinking 
and 
acting. 


To 
the 
man 
anxious 
to 
remove 
by 
purposive 
conduct 
some 
uneasiness 
felt, 
the 
question 
occurs: 
Where, 
how, 
and 
when 
would 
it 
be 
necessary 
to 
interfere 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
a 
definite 
result? 
Cognizance 
of 
the 
relation 
between 
a 
cause 
and 
its 
effect 
is 
the 
first 
step 
toward 
man’s 
orientation 
in 
the 
world 
and 
is 
the 
intellectual 
condition 
of 
any 
successful 
activity. 
All 
attempts 
to 
find 
a 
satisfactory 
logical, 
epistemological, 
or 
metaphysical 
foundation 
for 
the 
category 
of 
causality 
were 
doomed 
to 
fail. 
All 
we 
can 
say 
about 
causality 
is 
that 
it 
is 
a 
priori 
not 
only 
of 
human 
thought 
but 
also 
of 
human 
action. 


Eminent 
philosophers 
have 
tried 
to 
elaborate 
a 
complete 
list 
of 
the 
a 
priori 
categories, 
the 
necessary 
conditions 
of 
experience 
and 
thought. 
One 
does 
not 
belittle 
these 
attempts 
at 
analysis 
and 
systematization 
if 
one 
realizes 
that 
any 
proposed 
solution 
leaves 
a 
broad 
margin 
for 
the 
individual 
thinker’s 
discretion. 
There 
is 
only 
one 
point 
about 
which 
there 
cannot 
be 
any 
disagreement, 
viz., 
that 
they 
all 
can 
be 
reduced 
to 
the 
a 
priori 
insight 
into 
the 
regularity 
in 
the 
succession 
of 
all 
observable 
phenomena 
of 
the 
external 
world. 
In 
a 
universe 
lacking 
this 
regularity 
there 
could 
not 
be 
any 
thinking 
and 
nothing 
could 
be 
experienced. 
For 
experience 
is 
the 
awareness 
of 
identity 
or 
the 
absence 
of 
identity 
in 
what 
is 
perceived; 
it 
is 
the 
first 
step 
toward 
a 
classification 
of 
events. 
And 
the 
concept 
of 
classes 
would 
be 
empty 
and 
useless 
if 
there 
were 
no 
regularity. 


If 
there 
were 
no 
regularity, 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
to 
resort 
to 
classification 
and 
to 
construct 
a 
language. 
All 
words 
signify 
bundles 
of 
regularly 
connected 
acts 
of 
perception 
or 
regular 
relations 
among 
such 
bundles. 
This 
is 
valid 
also 
of 
the 
language 
of 
physics, 
which 
the 
positivists 
want 
to 
elevate 
to 
the 
rank 
of 
a 
universal 
language 
of 
science. 
In 
a 
world 
without 
regularity 
there 
would 
not 
be 
any 
possibility 
of 
formulating 
“protocol 
sentences.” 
7 
But 
even 
if 
it 
could 
be 
done, 
such 
a 
“protocol 
language” 
could 
not 
be 
the 
starting 
point 
of 
a 
science 
of 
physics. 
It 
would 
merely 
express 
historical 
facts. 


If 
there 
were 
no 
regularity, 
nothing 
could 
be 
learned 
from 
experience. 
In 
proclaiming 
experience 
as 
the 
main 
instrument 
of 
acquiring 
knowledge, 



empiricism 
implicitly 
acknowledges 
the 
principles 
of 
regularity 
and 
causality. 
When 
the 
empiricist 
refers 
to 
experience, 
the 
meaning 
is: 
as 
A 
was 
in 
the 
past 
followed 
by 
B, 
and 
as 
we 
assume 
that 
there 
prevails 
a 
regularity 
in 
the 
concatenation 
and 
succession 
of 
natural 
events, 
we 
expect 
that 
A 
will 
also 
in 
the 
future 
be 
followed 
by 
B. 
Therefore 
there 
is 
a 
fundamental 
difference 
between 
the 
meaning 
of 
experience 
in 
the 
field 
of 
natural 
events 
and 
in 
the 
field 
of 
human 
action. 


5. 
Induction 
Reasoning 
is 
necessarily 
always 
deductive. 
This 
was 
implicitly 
admitted 
by 
all 
the 
attempts 
to 
justify 
ampliative 
induction 
by 
demonstrating 
or 
proving 
its 
logical 
legitimacy, 
i.e., 
by 
providing 
a 
deductive 
interpretation 
of 
induction. 
The 
plight 
of 
empiricism 
consists 
precisely 
in 
its 
failure 
to 
explain 
satisfactorily 
how 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
infer 
from 
observed 
facts 
something 
concerning 
facts 
yet 
unobserved. 


All 
human 
knowledge 
concerning 
the 
universe 
presupposes 
and 
rests 
upon 
the 
cognition 
of 
the 
regularity 
in 
the 
succession 
and 
concatenation 
of 
observable 
events. 
It 
would 
be 
vain 
to 
search 
for 
a 
rule 
if 
there 
were 
no 
regularity. 
Inductive 
inference 
is 
conclusion 
from 
premises 
that 
invariably 
include 
the 
fundamental 
proposition 
of 
regularity. 


The 
practical 
problem 
of 
ampliative 
induction 
must 
be 
clearly 
distinguished 
from 
its 
logical 
problem. 
For 
the 
men 
who 
embark 
upon 
inductive 
inference 
are 
faced 
with 
the 
problem 
of 
correct 
sampling. 
Did 
we 
or 
did 
we 
not, 
out 
of 
the 
innumerable 
characteristics 
of 
the 
individual 
case 
or 
cases 
observed, 
choose 
those 
which 
are 
relevant 
for 
the 
production 
of 
the 
effect 
in 
question? 
Serious 
shortcomings 
of 
endeavors 
to 
learn 
something 
about 
the 
state 
of 
reality, 
whether 
in 
the 
mundane 
search 
for 
truth 
in 
everyday 
life 
or 
in 
systematic 
scientific 
research, 
are 
due 
to 
mistakes 
in 
this 
choice. 
No 
scientist 
doubts 
that 
what 
is 
correctly 
observed 
in 
one 
case 
must 
also 
be 
observed 
in 
all 
other 
cases 
offering 
the 
same 
conditions. 
The 
aim 
of 
laboratory 
experiments 
is 
to 
observe 
the 
effects 
of 
a 
change 
in 
one 
factor 
only, 
all 
the 
other 
factors 
remaining 
unchanged. 
Success 
or 
failure 
of 
such 
experiments 
presupposes, 
of 
course, 
the 
control 
of 
all 
the 
conditions 
that 
enter 
into 
their 
arrangement. 
The 
conclusions 
derived 
from 
experimentation 
are 
not 
based 
upon 
the 
repetition 
of 
the 
same 
arrangement, 
but 
upon 
the 
assumption 
that 
what 
happened 
in 
one 
case 
must 
necessarily 
also 
happen 
in 



all 
other 
cases 
of 
the 
same 
type. 
It 
would 
be 
impossible 
to 
infer 
anything 
from 
one 
case 
or 
from 
an 
innumerable 
series 
of 
cases 
without 
this 
assumption, 
which 
implies 
the 
a 
priori 
category 
of 
regularity. 
Experience 
is 
always 
the 
experience 
of 
past 
events 
and 
could 
not 
teach 
us 
anything 
about 
future 
events 
if 
the 
category 
of 
regularity 
were 
merely 
a 
vain 
assumption. 


The 
panphysicalists’ 
probability 
approach 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
induction 
is 
an 
abortive 
attempt 
to 
deal 
with 
induction 
without 
reference 
to 
the 
category 
of 
regularity. 
If 
we 
do 
not 
take 
account 
of 
regularity, 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
whatever 
to 
infer 
from 
anything 
that 
happened 
in 
the 
past 
what 
will 
happen 
in 
the 
future. 
As 
soon 
as 
we 
try 
to 
dispense 
with 
the 
category 
of 
regularity, 
all 
scientific 
effort 
appears 
useless, 
and 
the 
search 
for 
knowledge 
about 
what 
is 
popularly 
called 
the 
laws 
of 
nature 
becomes 
meaningless 
and 
futile. 
What 
is 
natural 
science 
about 
if 
not 
about 
the 
regularity 
in 
the 
flux 
of 
events? 


Yet 
the 
category 
of 
regularity 
is 
rejected 
by 
the 
champions 
of 
logical 
positivism. 
They 
pretend 
that 
modern 
physics 
has 
led 
to 
results 
incompatible 
with 
the 
doctrine 
of 
a 
universally 
prevailing 
regularity 
and 
has 
shown 
that 
what 
has 
been 
considered 
by 
the 
“school 
philosophy” 
as 
the 
manifestation 
of 
a 
necessary 
and 
inexorable 
regularity 
is 
merely 
the 
product 
of 
a 
great 
number 
of 
atomic 
occurrences. 
In 
the 
microscopic 
sphere 
there 
is, 
they 
say, 
no 
regularity 
whatever. 
What 
macroscopic 
physics 
used 
to 
consider 
as 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
operation 
of 
a 
strict 
regularity 
is 
merely 
the 
result 
of 
a 
great 
number 
of 
purely 
accidental 
elementary 
processes. 
The 
laws 
of 
macroscopic 
physics 
are 
not 
strict 
laws, 
but 
actually 
statistical 
laws. 
It 
could 
happen 
that 
the 
events 
in 
the 
microscopic 
sphere 
produce 
in 
the 
macroscopic 
sphere 
events 
that 
are 
different 
from 
those 
described 
by 
the 
merely 
statistical 
laws 
of 
macroscopic 
physics, 
although, 
they 
admit, 
the 
probability 
of 
such 
an 
occurrence 
is 
very 
small. 
But, 
they 
contend, 
the 
cognition 
of 
this 
possibility 
demolishes 
the 
idea 
that 
there 
prevails 
in 
the 
universe 
a 
strict 
regularity 
in 
the 
succession 
and 
concatenation 
of 
all 
events. 
The 
categories 
of 
regularity 
and 
causality 
must 
be 
abandoned 
and 
replaced 
by 
the 
laws 
of 
probability.8 


It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
physicists 
of 
our 
age 
are 
faced 
with 
behavior 
on 
the 
part 
of 
some 
entities 
that 
they 
cannot 
describe 
as 
the 
outcome 
of 
a 
discernible 
regularity. 
However, 
this 
is 
not 
the 
first 
time 
that 
science 
has 
been 
faced 
with 
such 
a 
problem. 
The 
human 
search 
for 
knowledge 
must 
always 
encounter 
something 
that 
it 
cannot 
trace 
back 
to 
something 
else 
of 
which 
it 
would 
appear 
as 
the 
necessary 
effect. 
There 
is 
always 
in 
science 
some 
ultimate 
given. 
For 
contemporary 
physics 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
atoms 
appears 
as 
such 



an 
ultimate 
given. 
The 
physicists 
are 
today 
at 
a 
loss 
to 
reduce 
certain 
atomic 
processes 
to 
their 
causes. 
One 
does 
not 
detract 
from 
the 
marvelous 
achievements 
of 
physics 
by 
establishing 
the 
fact 
that 
this 
state 
of 
affairs 
is 
what 
is 
commonly 
called 
ignorance. 


What 
makes 
it 
possible 
for 
the 
human 
mind 
to 
orient 
itself 
in 
the 
bewildering 
multiplicity 
of 
external 
stimuli 
that 
affect 
our 
senses, 
to 
acquire 
what 
is 
called 
knowledge, 
and 
to 
develop 
the 
natural 
sciences 
is 
the 
cognition 
of 
an 
inevitable 
regularity 
and 
uniformity 
prevailing 
in 
the 
succession 
and 
concatenation 
of 
such 
events. 
The 
criterion 
that 
induces 
us 
to 
distinguish 
various 
classes 
of 
things 
is 
the 
behavior 
of 
these 
things. 
If 
a 
thing 
in 
only 
one 
regard 
behaves 
(reacts 
to 
a 
definite 
stimulus) 
in 
a 
way 
different 
from 
the 
behavior 
of 
other 
things 
to 
which 
it 
is 
equal 
in 
all 
other 
respects, 
it 
must 
be 
assigned 
to 
a 
different 
class. 


We 
may 
look 
upon 
the 
molecules 
and 
the 
atoms 
the 
behavior 
of 
which 
is 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
probabilistic 
doctrines 
either 
as 
original 
elements 
or 
as 
derivatives 
of 
the 
original 
elements 
of 
reality. 
It 
does 
not 
matter 
which 
of 
these 
alternatives 
we 
choose. 
For 
in 
any 
case 
their 
behavior 
is 
the 
outcome 
of 
their 
very 
nature. 
(To 
say 
it 
more 
correctly: 
It 
is 
their 
behavior 
that 
constitutes 
what 
we 
call 
their 
nature.) 
As 
we 
see 
it, 
there 
are 
different 
classes 
of 
these 
molecules 
and 
atoms. 
They 
are 
not 
uniform; 
what 
we 
call 
molecules 
and 
atoms 
are 
groups 
composed 
of 
various 
subgroups 
the 
members 
of 
each 
of 
which 
in 
some 
regards 
differ 
in 
their 
behavior 
from 
the 
members 
of 
the 
other 
subgroups. 
If 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
members 
of 
the 
various 
subgroups 
were 
different 
from 
what 
it 
is 
or 
if 
the 
numerical 
distribution 
of 
subgroup 
membership 
were 
different, 
the 
joint 
effect 
produced 
by 
the 
behavior 
of 
all 
the 
members 
of 
the 
groups 
would 
be 
different 
too. 
This 
effect 
is 
determined 
by 
two 
factors: 
the 
specific 
behavior 
of 
the 
members 
of 
each 
subgroup 
and 
the 
size 
of 
subgroup 
membership. 


If 
the 
proponents 
of 
the 
probabilistic 
doctrine 
of 
induction 
had 
acknowledged 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
are 
various 
subgroups 
of 
microscopic 
entities, 
they 
would 
have 
realized 
that 
the 
joint 
effect 
of 
the 
operation 
of 
these 
entities 
results 
in 
what 
the 
macroscopic 
doctrine 
calls 
a 
law 
admitting 
of 
no 
exception. 
They 
would 
have 
had 
to 
confess 
that 
we 
do 
not 
know 
today 
why 
the 
subgroups 
differ 
from 
one 
another 
in 
some 
regards 
and 
how, 
out 
of 
the 
interaction 
of 
the 
members 
of 
the 
various 
subgroups, 
the 
definite 
joint 
effect 
emerges 
in 
the 
macroscopic 
sphere. 
Instead 
of 
this 
procedure 
they 
arbitrarily 
ascribe 
to 
the 
individual 
molecules 
and 
atoms 
the 
faculty 
of 
choosing 
among 



various 
alternatives 
of 
behavior. 
Their 
doctrine 
does 
not 
essentially 
differ 
from 
primitive 
animism. 
Just 
as 
the 
primitives 
ascribed 
to 
the 
“soul” 
of 
the 
river 
the 
power 
to 
choose 
between 
quietly 
flowing 
in 
its 
customary 
bed 
or 
inundating 
the 
adjacent 
fields, 
so 
they 
believe 
that 
these 
microscopic 
entities 
are 
free 
to 
determine 
some 
characteristics 
of 
their 
behavior, 
e.g., 
the 
speed 
and 
the 
path 
of 
their 
movements. 
In 
their 
philosophy 
it 
is 
implied 
that 
these 
microscopic 
entities 
are 
acting 
beings 
just 
like 
men. 


But 
even 
if 
we 
were 
to 
accept 
this 
interpretation, 
we 
must 
not 
forget 
that 
human 
action 
is 
entirely 
determined 
by 
the 
individuals’ 
physiological 
equipment 
and 
by 
all 
the 
ideas 
that 
were 
working 
in 
their 
minds. 
As 
we 
do 
not 
have 
any 
reason 
to 
assume 
that 
these 
microscopic 
entities 
are 
endowed 
with 
a 
mind 
generating 
ideas, 
we 
must 
assume 
that 
what 
are 
called 
their 
choices 
necessarily 
correspond 
to 
their 
physical 
and 
chemical 
structure. 
The 
individual 
atom 
or 
molecule 
behaves 
in 
a 
definite 
environment 
and 
under 
definite 
conditions 
precisely 
as 
its 
structure 
enjoins 
it. 
The 
speed 
and 
the 
path 
of 
its 
movements 
and 
its 
reaction 
to 
any 
encounters 
with 
factors 
external 
to 
its 
own 
nature 
or 
structure 
are 
strictly 
determined 
by 
this 
nature 
or 
structure. 
If 
one 
does 
not 
accept 
this 
interpretation, 
one 
indulges 
in 
the 
absurd 
metaphysical 
assumption 
that 
these 
molecules 
and 
atoms 
are 
equipped 
with 
free 
will 
in 
the 
sense 
which 
the 
most 
radical 
and 
naive 
indeterminist 
doctrines 
ascribed 
to 
man. 


Bertrand 
Russell 
tries 
to 
illustrate 
the 
problem 
by 
comparing 
the 
position 
of 
quantum 
mechanics 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
atoms 
to 
that 
of 
a 
railroad 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
people 
making 
use 
of 
its 
facilities. 
The 
booking-office 
clerk 
at 
Paddington 
can 
discover, 
if 
he 
chooses, 
what 
proportion 
of 
travellers 
from 
that 
station 
go 
to 
Birmingham, 
what 
proportion 
to 
Exeter, 
and 
so 
on, 
but 
he 
knows 
nothing 
of 
the 
individual 
reasons 
that 
lead 
to 
one 
choice 
in 
one 
case 
and 
another 
in 
another. 
But 
Russell 
has 
to 
admit 
that 
the 
cases 
are 
not 
“wholly 
analogous” 
because 
the 
clerk 
can 
in 
his 
nonprofessional 
moments 
find 
out 
things 
about 
human 
beings 
that 
they 
do 
not 
mention 
when 
they 
are 
taking 
tickets, 
while 
the 
physicist 
in 
observing 
atoms 
has 
no 
such 
advantage.9 


It 
is 
characteristic 
of 
the 
reasoning 
of 
Russell 
that 
he 
exemplifies 
his 
case 
by 
referring 
to 
the 
mind 
of 
a 
subaltern 
clerk 
to 
whom 
the 
unvarying 
performance 
of 
a 
strictly 
limited 
number 
of 
simple 
operations 
is 
assigned. 
What 
such 
a 
man 
(whose 
work 
could 
be 
performed 
as 
well 
by 
a 
vending 
automaton) 
thinks 
about 
things 
that 
transcend 
the 
narrow 
sphere 
of 
his 
duties 



is 
without 
avail. 
To 
the 
promoters 
who 
took 
the 
initiative 
in 
advancing 
the 
project 
of 
the 
railroad, 
to 
the 
capitalists 
who 
invested 
in 
the 
company, 
and 
to 
the 
managers 
who 
administer 
its 
operations, 
the 
problems 
involved 
appear 
in 
a 
quite 
different 
light. 
They 
built 
and 
operate 
the 
road 
because 
they 
anticipate 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
are 
certain 
reasons 
that 
will 
induce 
a 
number 
of 
people 
to 
travel 
from 
one 
point 
of 
their 
route 
to 
another. 
They 
know 
the 
conditions 
that 
determine 
these 
people’s 
behavior, 
they 
know 
also 
that 
these 
conditions 
are 
changing, 
and 
they 
are 
intent 
upon 
influencing 
the 
size 
and 
the 
direction 
of 
these 
changes 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
and 
to 
increase 
their 
patronage 
and 
the 
enterprise’s 
proceeds. 
Their 
conduct 
of 
business 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
a 
reliance 
upon 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
mythical 
“statistical 
law.” 
It 
is 
guided 
by 
the 
insight 
that 
there 
is 
a 
latent 
demand 
for 
travel 
facilities 
on 
the 
part 
of 
such 
a 
number 
of 
people 
that 
it 
pays 
to 
satisfy 
it 
by 
the 
operation 
of 
a 
railroad. 
And 
they 
are 
fully 
aware 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
quantity 
of 
service 
they 
are 
able 
to 
sell 
could 
be 
drastically 
reduced 
one 
day 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that 
they 
would 
be 
forced 
to 
go 
out 
of 
business. 


Bertrand 
Russell 
and 
all 
other 
positivists 
referring 
to 
what 
they 
call 
“statistical 
laws” 
are 
committing 
a 
serious 
blunder 
in 
commenting 
upon 
human 
statistics, 
i.e., 
statistics 
dealing 
with 
facts 
of 
human 
action 
as 
distinguished 
from 
the 
facts 
of 
human 
physiology. 
They 
do 
not 
take 
into 
account 
the 
fact 
that 
all 
these 
statistical 
figures 
are 
continually 
changing, 
sometimes 
more, 
sometimes 
less 
rapidly. 
There 
is 
in 
human 
valuations 
and 
consequently 
in 
human 
actions 
no 
such 
regularity 
as 
in 
the 
field 
investigated 
by 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
Human 
behavior 
is 
guided 
by 
motives, 
and 
the 
historian 
dealing 
with 
the 
past 
as 
well 
as 
the 
businessman 
intent 
upon 
anticipating 
the 
future 
must 
try 
to 
“understand” 
this 
behavior.10 


If 
the 
historians 
and 
the 
acting 
individuals 
were 
not 
able 
to 
apply 
this 
specific 
understanding 
of 
their 
fellow 
men’s 
behavior, 
and 
if 
the 
natural 
sciences 
and 
the 
acting 
individuals 
were 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
grasp 
something 
about 
the 
regularity 
in 
the 
concatenation 
and 
succession 
of 
natural 
events, 
the 
universe 
would 
appear 
to 
them 
as 
an 
unintelligible 
chaos 
and 
they 
could 
not 
contrive 
any 
means 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
any 
ends. 
There 
would 
not 
be 
any 
reasoning, 
any 
knowledge, 
or 
any 
science, 
and 
there 
would 
not 
be 
any 
purposive 
influencing 
of 
environmental 
conditions 
on 
the 
part 
of 
man. 


The 
natural 
sciences 
are 
possible 
only 
because 
there 
prevails 
regularity 
in 
the 
succession 
of 
external 
events. 
Of 
course, 
there 
are 
limits 
to 
what 
man 
can 
learn 
about 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
universe. 
There 
are 
unobservables 
and 



there 
are 
relations 
about 
which 
science 
up 
to 
now 
has 
not 
provided 
an 
interpretation. 
But 
the 
awareness 
of 
these 
facts 
does 
not 
falsify 
the 
categories 
of 
regularity 
and 
causality. 


6. 
The 
Paradox 
of 
Probability 
Empiricism 
Empiricism 
proclaims 
that 
experience 
is 
the 
only 
source 
of 
human 
knowledge 
and 
rejects 
as 
a 
metaphysical 
prepossession 
the 
idea 
that 
all 
experience 
presupposes 
a 
priori 
categories. 
But 
starting 
from 
its 
empiricistic 
approach, 
it 
postulates 
the 
possibility 
of 
events 
that 
have 
never 
been 
experienced 
by 
any 
man. 
Thus, 
we 
are 
told, 
physics 
cannot 
exclude 
the 
possibility 
that 
“when 
you 
put 
an 
ice 
cube 
into 
a 
glass 
of 
water, 
the 
water 
starts 
boiling 
and 
the 
ice 
cube 
gets 
as 
cold 
as 
the 
interior 
of 
a 
deepfreezing 
cabinet.” 
11 


However, 
this 
neoempiricism 
is 
far 
from 
being 
consistent 
in 
the 
application 
of 
its 
doctrine. 
If 
there 
is 
no 
regularity 
in 
nature, 
nothing 
justifies 
the 
distinction 
between 
various 
classes 
of 
things 
and 
events. 
If 
one 
calls 
some 
molecules 
oxygen 
and 
others 
nitrogen, 
one 
implies 
that 
each 
member 
of 
these 
classes 
behaves 
in 
a 
definite 
way 
different 
from 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
members 
of 
other 
classes. 
If 
one 
assumes 
that 
the 
behavior 
of 
an 
individual 
molecule 
can 
deviate 
from 
the 
way 
in 
which 
other 
molecules 
behave, 
one 
must 
either 
assign 
it 
to 
a 
special 
class 
or 
one 
must 
assume 
that 
its 
deviation 
was 
induced 
by 
the 
intervention 
of 
something 
to 
which 
other 
members 
of 
its 
class 
had 
not 
been 
exposed. 
If 
one 
says 
that 
one 
cannot 
exclude 
the 
possibility 
“that 
some 
day 
the 
molecules 
of 
the 
air 
in 
our 
room, 
by 
pure 
chance, 
arrive 
at 
an 
ordered 
state 
such 
that 
the 
molecules 
of 
oxygen 
are 
assembled 
on 
one 
side 
of 
the 
room 
and 
those 
of 
nitrogen 
on 
the 
other,”12 
one 
implies 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
either 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
oxygen 
and 
nitrogen 
or 
in 
the 
environment 
in 
which 
they 
are 
dwelling 
that 
results 
in 
the 
way 
in 
which 
they 
are 
distributed 
in 
the 
air. 
One 
assumes 
that 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
individual 
molecules 
in 
all 
other 
regards 
is 
determined 
by 
their 
constitution, 
but 
that 
they 
are 
“free” 
to 
choose 
the 
place 
of 
their 
dwelling. 
One 
assumes 
quite 
arbitrarily 
that 
one 
of 
the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
molecules, 
viz., 
their 
movement, 
is 
not 
determined, 
while 
all 
their 
other 
characteristics 
are 
determined. 
One 
implies 
that 
there 
is 
something 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
molecules—one 
is 
tempted 
to 
say: 
in 
their 
“soul”—that 
gives 
them 
the 
faculty 
of 
“choosing” 
the 
path 
of 
their 
wanderings. 
One 
fails 
to 
realize 
that 
a 
complete 
description 
of 
the 
behavior 
of 



the 
molecules 
ought 
also 
to 
include 
their 
movements. 
It 
would 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
process 
that 
makes 
the 
molecules 
of 
oxygen 
and 
nitrogen 
associate 
with 
one 
another 
in 
the 
way 
in 
which 
they 
do 
in 
the 
air. 


If 
Reichenbach 
had 
lived 
as 
a 
contemporary 
of 
magicians 
and 
tribal 
medicine 
men, 
he 
would 
have 
argued: 
Some 
people 
are 
afflicted 
with 
a 
disease 
having 
definite 
symptoms 
that 
kills 
them; 
others 
remain 
healthy 
and 
alive. 
We 
do 
not 
know 
of 
any 
factor 
the 
presence 
of 
which 
would 
cause 
the 
suffering 
of 
those 
stricken 
and 
the 
absence 
of 
which 
would 
cause 
the 
immunity 
of 
others. 
It 
is 
obvious 
that 
these 
phenomena 
cannot 
be 
dealt 
with 
scientifically 
if 
you 
cling 
to 
the 
superstitious 
concept 
of 
causality. 
All 
that 
we 
can 
know 
about 
them 
is 
the 
“statistical 
law” 
that 
X% 
of 
the 
population 
were 
afflicted 
and 
the 
rest 
not. 


7. 
Materialism 
Determinism 
must 
be 
clearly 
distinguished 
from 
materialism. 
Materialism 
declares 
that 
the 
only 
factors 
producing 
change 
are 
those 
that 
are 
accessible 
to 
investigation 
by 
the 
methods 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
It 
does 
not 
necessarily 
deny 
the 
fact 
that 
human 
ideas, 
judgments 
of 
value, 
and 
volitions 
are 
real 
too 
and 
can 
produce 
definite 
changes. 
But 
as 
far 
as 
it 
does 
not 
deny 
this, 
it 
asserts 
that 
these 
“ideal” 
factors 
are 
the 
inevitable 
result 
of 
external 
events 
that 
necessarily 
beget 
in 
the 
bodily 
structure 
of 
men 
definite 
reactions. 
It 
is 
only 
a 
deficiency 
of 
the 
present 
state 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
that 
prevents 
us 
from 
imputing 
all 
manifestations 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
to 
the 
material— 
physical, 
chemical, 
biological 
and 
physiological—events 
that 
have 
brought 
them 
about. 
A 
more 
perfect 
knowledge, 
they 
say, 
will 
show 
how 
the 
material 
factors 
have 
necessarily 
produced 
in 
the 
man 
Mohammed 
the 
Moslem 
religion, 
in 
the 
man 
Descartes 
co-ordinate 
geometry, 
and 
in 
the 
man 
Racine 
Phaedra. 


It 
is 
useless 
to 
argue 
with 
the 
supporters 
of 
a 
doctrine 
that 
merely 
establishes 
a 
program 
without 
indicating 
how 
it 
could 
be 
put 
into 
effect. 
What 
can 
be 
done 
and 
must 
be 
done 
is 
to 
disclose 
how 
its 
harbingers 
contradict 
themselves 
and 
what 
consequences 
must 
result 
from 
its 
consistent 
application. 


If 
the 
emergence 
of 
every 
idea 
is 
to 
be 
dealt 
with 
as 
one 
deals 
with 
the 
emergence 
of 
all 
other 
natural 
events, 
it 
is 
no 
longer 
permissible 
to 
distinguish 
between 
true 
and 
false 
propositions. 
Then 
the 
theorems 
of 



Descartes 
are 
neither 
better 
nor 
worse 
than 
the 
bungling 
of 
Peter, 
a 
dull 
candidate 
for 
a 
degree, 
in 
his 
examination 
paper. 
The 
material 
factors 
cannot 
err. 
They 
have 
produced 
in 
the 
man 
Descartes 
co-ordinate 
geometry 
and 
in 
the 
man 
Peter 
something 
that 
his 
teacher, 
not 
enlightened 
by 
the 
gospel 
of 
materialism, 
considers 
as 
nonsense. 
But 
what 
entitles 
this 
teacher 
to 
sit 
in 
judgment 
upon 
nature? 
Who 
are 
the 
materialist 
philosophers 
to 
condemn 
what 
the 
material 
factors 
have 
produced 
in 
the 
bodies 
of 
the 
“idealistic” 
philosophers. 


It 
would 
be 
useless 
for 
the 
materialists 
to 
point 
to 
pragmatism’s 
distinction 
between 
what 
works 
and 
what 
does 
not 
work. 
For 
this 
distinction 
introduces 
into 
the 
chain 
of 
reasoning 
a 
factor 
that 
is 
foreign 
to 
the 
natural 
sciences, 
viz., 
finality. 
A 
doctrine 
or 
proposition 
works 
if 
conduct 
directed 
by 
it 
brings 
about 
the 
end 
aimed 
at. 
But 
the 
choice 
of 
the 
end 
is 
determined 
by 
ideas, 
is 
in 
itself 
a 
mental 
fact. 
So 
is 
also 
the 
judment 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
end 
chosen 
has 
been 
attained. 
For 
consistent 
materialism 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
distinguish 
between 
purposive 
action 
and 
merely 
vegetative, 
plant-like 
living. 


Materialists 
think 
that 
their 
doctrine 
merely 
eliminates 
the 
distinction 
between 
what 
is 
morally 
good 
and 
morally 
bad. 
They 
fail 
to 
see 
that 
it 
no 
less 
wipes 
out 
any 
difference 
between 
what 
is 
true 
and 
what 
is 
untrue 
and 
thus 
deprives 
all 
mental 
acts 
of 
any 
meaning. 
If 
there 
stands 
between 
the 
“real 
things” 
of 
the 
external 
world 
and 
the 
mental 
acts 
nothing 
that 
could 
be 
looked 
upon 
as 
essentially 
different 
from 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
forces 
described 
by 
the 
traditional 
natural 
sciences, 
then 
we 
must 
put 
up 
with 
these 
mental 
phenomena 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
we 
respond 
to 
natural 
events. 
For 
a 
doctrine 
asserting 
that 
thoughts 
are 
in 
the 
same 
relation 
to 
the 
brain 
in 
which 
gall 
is 
to 
the 
liver,13 
it 
is 
not 
more 
permissible 
to 
distinguish 
between 
true 
and 
untrue 
ideas 
than 
between 
true 
and 
untrue 
gall. 


8. 
The 
Absurdity 
of 
Any 
Materialistic 
Philosophy 
The 
insurmountable 
difficulties 
that 
any 
materialistic 
interpretation 
of 
reality 
encounters 
can 
be 
shown 
in 
an 
analysis 
of 
the 
most 
popular 
materialistic 
philosophy, 
Marxian 
dialectical 
materialism. 


Of 
course, 
what 
is 
called 
dialectical 
materialism 
is 
not 
a 
genuine 
materialistic 
doctrine. 
In 
its 
context 
the 
factor 
that 
produces 
all 
changes 
in 
the 
ideological 
and 
social 
conditions 
of 
man’s 
history 
is 
the 
“material 
productive 
forces.” 
Neither 
Marx 
nor 
any 
of 
his 
followers 
defined 
this 
term. 
But 
from 
all 



the 
examples 
they 
provided 
one 
must 
infer 
that 
what 
they 
had 
in 
mind 
was 
the 
tools, 
machines, 
and 
other 
artifacts 
that 
men 
employ 
in 
their 
productive 
activities. 
Yet 
these 
instruments 
are 
in 
themselves 
not 
ultimate 
material 
things, 
but 
the 
products 
of 
a 
purposive 
mental 
process.14 
But 
Marxism 
is 
the 
only 
attempt 
to 
carry 
a 
materialistic 
or 
quasi-materialistic 
doctrine 
beyond 
the 
mere 
enunciation 
of 
a 
metaphysical 
principle 
and 
to 
deduce 
from 
it 
all 
other 
manifestations 
of 
the 
human 
mind. 
Thus, 
we 
must 
refer 
to 
it 
if 
we 
want 
to 
show 
the 
fundamental 
shortcoming 
of 
materialism. 


As 
Marx 
sees 
it, 
the 
material 
productive 
forces 
bring 
forth— 
independently 
of 
the 
will 
of 
men—the 
“production 
relations,” 
i.e., 
the 
social 
system 
of 
property 
laws, 
and 
their 
“ideological 
superstructure,” 
i.e., 
the 
juridical, 
political, 
religious, 
artistic, 
or 
philosophical 
ideas.15 
In 
this 
scheme, 
action 
and 
volition 
are 
ascribed 
to 
the 
material 
productive 
forces. 
They 
want 
to 
attain 
a 
definite 
goal, 
viz., 
they 
want 
to 
be 
freed 
from 
fetters 
that 
are 
hindering 
their 
development. 
Men 
are 
mistaken 
when 
they 
believe 
that 
they 
themselves 
are 
thinking, 
resorting 
to 
judgments 
of 
value, 
and 
acting. 
In 
fact, 
the 
production 
relations, 
the 
necessary 
effect 
of 
the 
prevailing 
stage 
of 
the 
material 
productive 
forces, 
are 
determining 
their 
ideas, 
volitions, 
and 
actions. 
All 
historical 
changes 
are 
ultimately 
produced 
by 
the 
changes 
in 
the 
material 
productive 
forces, 
which—as 
Marx 
implicitly 
assumes—are 
independent 
of 
human 
influence. 
All 
human 
ideas 
are 
the 
adequate 
superstructure 
of 
the 
material 
productive 
forces. 
These 
forces 
aim 
ultimately 
at 
the 
establishment 
of 
socialism, 
a 
transformation 
that 
is 
bound 
to 
come 
“with 
the 
inexorability 
of 
a 
law 
of 
nature.” 


Now 
let 
us 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
argument 
admit 
that 
the 
material 
productive 
forces 
have 
a 
constitution 
such 
that 
they 
are 
continually 
trying 
to 
free 
themselves 
from 
fetters 
upon 
their 
development. 
But 
why 
must, 
out 
of 
these 
attempts, 
first 
capitalism 
and, 
at 
a 
later 
stage 
of 
their 
development, 
socialism 
emerge? 
Do 
these 
forces 
reflect 
upon 
their 
own 
problems 
and 
finally 
reach 
the 
conclusion 
that 
the 
existing 
property 
relations, 
from 
having 
been 
forms 
of 
their 
own 
(viz., 
the 
forces’) 
development, 
have 
turned 
into 
fetters16 
and 
that 
therefore 
they 
no 
longer 
correspond 
(“entsprechen”) 
to 
the 
present 
stage 
of 
their 
(viz., 
the 
forces’) 
development?17 
And 
do 
they, 
on 
the 
ground 
of 
this 
insight, 
resolve 
that 
these 
fetters 
have 
to 
“burst 
asunder,” 
and 
do 
they 
then 
proceed 
to 
action 
that 
causes 
them 
to 
burst 
asunder? 
And 
do 
they 
determine 
what 
new 
production 
relations 
have 
to 
take 
the 
place 
of 
the 
burst 
ones? 


The 
absurdity 
of 
ascribing 
such 
thinking 
and 
acting 
to 
the 
material 



productive 
forces 
is 
so 
blatant 
that 
Marx 
himself 
paid 
but 
little 
attention 
to 
his 
famous 
doctrine 
when 
later, 
in 
his 
main 
treatise, 
Capital, 
he 
made 
more 
specific 
his 
prognostication 
about 
the 
coming 
of 
socialism. 
Here 
he 
refers 
not 
merely 
to 
action 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
material 
productive 
forces. 
He 
speaks 
of 
the 
proletarian 
masses 
who, 
dissatisfied 
with 
the 
progressive 
impoverishment 
that 
capitalism 
allegedly 
brings 
upon 
them, 
aim 
at 
socialism, 
obviously 
because 
they 
consider 
it 
as 
a 
more 
satisfactory 
system.18 


Every 
variety 
of 
materialistic 
or 
quasi-materialistic 
metaphysics 
must 
imply 
converting 
an 
inanimate 
factor 
into 
a 
quasi 
man 
and 
ascribing 
to 
it 
the 
power 
to 
think, 
to 
pass 
judgments 
of 
value, 
to 
choose 
ends, 
and 
to 
resort 
to 
means 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
ends 
chosen. 
It 
must 
shift 
the 
specifically 
human 
faculty 
of 
acting 
to 
a 
nonhuman 
entity 
that 
it 
implicitly 
endows 
with 
human 
intelligence 
and 
discernment. 
There 
is 
no 
way 
to 
eliminate 
from 
an 
analysis 
of 
the 
universe 
any 
reference 
to 
the 
mind. 
Those 
who 
try 
it 
merely 
substitute 
a 
phantom 
of 
their 
own 
invention 
for 
reality. 


From 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
his 
professed 
materialism—and, 
for 
that 
matter, 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
any 
materialistic 
doctrine—Marx 
did 
not 
have 
the 
right 
to 
reject 
as 
false 
any 
doctrines 
developed 
by 
those 
with 
whom 
he 
disagreed. 
His 
materialism 
would 
have 
enjoined 
upon 
him 
a 
kind 
of 
listless 
recognition 
of 
any 
opinion 
and 
a 
readiness 
to 
attach 
to 
every 
idea 
advanced 
by 
a 
human 
being 
the 
same 
value 
as 
to 
any 
other 
idea 
advanced 
by 
somebody 
else. 
To 
escape 
such 
a 
self-defeating 
conclusion, 
Marx 
took 
recourse 
to 
his 
scheme 
of 
philosophy 
of 
history. 
He 
pretended 
that, 
by 
dint 
of 
a 
special 
charisma, 
denied 
to 
other 
mortals, 
he 
had 
a 
revelation 
that 
told 
him 
what 
course 
history 
must 
necessarily 
and 
unavoidably 
take. 
History 
leads 
to 
socialism. 
The 
meaning 
of 
history, 
the 
purpose 
for 
which 
man 
has 
been 
created 
(it 
is 
not 
said, 
by 
whom) 
is 
to 
realize 
socialism. 
There 
is 
no 
need 
to 
pay 
any 
attention 
to 
the 
ideas 
of 
people 
whom 
this 
message 
did 
not 
reach 
or 
who 
stubbornly 
refuse 
to 
believe 
in 
it. 


What 
epistemology 
has 
to 
learn 
from 
this 
state 
of 
affairs 
is 
this: 
Any 
doctrine 
that 
teaches 
that 
some 
“real” 
or 
“external” 
forces 
write 
their 
own 
story 
in 
the 
human 
mind 
and 
thus 
tries 
to 
reduce 
the 
human 
mind 
to 
an 
apparatus 
that 
transforms 
“reality” 
into 
ideas 
in 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
digestive 
organs 
assimilate 
food 
is 
at 
a 
loss 
to 
distinguish 
between 
what 
is 
true 
and 
what 
is 
not. 
The 
only 
way 
it 
can 
avoid 
a 
radical 
skepticism 
that 
does 
not 
have 
any 
means 
of 
sifting 
truth 
from 
falsehood 
in 
ideas 
is 
by 
distinguishing 
between 
“good” 
men, 
i.e., 
those 
who 
are 
equipped 
with 
the 



faculty 
of 
judging 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
mysterious 
superhuman 
power 
that 
directs 
all 
affairs 
of 
the 
universe, 
and 
“bad” 
men, 
who 
lack 
this 
faculty. 
It 
must 
consider 
as 
hopeless 
any 
attempts 
to 
change 
the 
opinions 
of 
the 
“bad” 
men 
by 
discursive 
reasoning 
and 
persuasion. 
The 
only 
means 
to 
bring 
to 
an 
end 
the 
conflict 
of 
antagonistic 
ideas 
is 
to 
exterminate 
the 
“bad” 
men, 
i.e., 
the 
carriers 
of 
ideas 
that 
are 
different 
from 
those 
of 
the 
“good” 
men. 
Thus, 
materialism 
ultimately 
engenders 
the 
same 
methods 
of 
dealing 
with 
dissent 
that 
tyrants 
used 
always 
and 
everywhere. 


In 
establishing 
this 
fact 
epistemology 
provides 
a 
clue 
for 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
history 
of 
our 
age. 



2 


The 
Activistic 
Basis 
of 
Knowledge 


1. 
Man 
and 
Action 
The 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
man 
is 
action. 
Man 
aims 
at 
changing 
some 
of 
the 
conditions 
of 
his 
environment 
in 
order 
to 
substitute 
a 
state 
of 
affairs 
that 
suits 
him 
better 
for 
another 
state 
that 
suits 
him 
less. 
All 
manifestations 
of 
life 
and 
behavior 
with 
regard 
to 
which 
man 
differs 
from 
all 
other 
beings 
and 
things 
known 
to 
him 
are 
instances 
of 
action 
and 
can 
be 
dealt 
with 
only 
from 
what 
we 
may 
call 
an 
activistic 
point 
of 
view. 
The 
study 
of 
man, 
as 
far 
as 
it 
is 
not 
biology, 
begins 
and 
ends 
with 
the 
study 
of 
human 
action. 


Action 
is 
purposive 
conduct. 
It 
is 
not 
simply 
behavior, 
but 
behavior 
begot 
by 
judgments 
of 
value, 
aiming 
at 
a 
definite 
end 
and 
guided 
by 
ideas 
concerning 
the 
suitability 
or 
unsuitability 
of 
definite 
means. 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
deal 
with 
it 
without 
the 
categories 
of 
causality 
and 
finality. 
It 
is 
conscious 
behavior. 
It 
is 
choosing. 
It 
is 
volition; 
it 
is 
a 
display 
of 
the 
will. 


Action 
is 
sometimes 
viewed 
as 
the 
human 
variety 
of 
the 
struggle 
for 
survival 
common 
to 
all 
living 
beings. 
However, 
the 
term 
“struggle 
for 
survival” 
as 
applied 
to 
animals 
and 
plants 
is 
a 
metaphor. 
It 
would 
be 
a 
mistake 
to 
infer 
anything 
from 
its 
use. 
In 
applying 
literally 
the 
term 
struggle 
to 
animals 
and 
plants 
one 
would 
ascribe 
to 
them 
the 
power 
to 
become 
aware 
of 
factors 
threatening 
their 
existence, 
the 
will 
to 
preserve 
their 
own 
integrity, 
and 
the 
mental 
faculty 
of 
finding 
means 
for 
its 
preservation. 


Seen 
from 
an 
activist 
point 
of 
view, 
knowledge 
is 
a 
tool 
of 
action. 
Its 
function 
is 
to 
advise 
man 
how 
to 
proceed 
in 
his 
endeavors 
to 
remove 
uneasiness. 
At 
the 
higher 
stages 
of 
man’s 
evolution 
from 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
Stone 
Age 
to 
those 
of 
the 
age 
of 
modern 
capitalism, 
uneasiness 
is 
also 
felt 
by 



the 
mere 
prevalence 
of 
ignorance 
concerning 
the 
nature 
and 
the 
meaning 
of 
all 
things, 
no 
matter 
whether 
knowledge 
about 
these 
fundamental 
things 
would 
be 
of 
practical 
use 
for 
any 
technological 
planning. 
To 
live 
in 
a 
universe 
with 
whose 
final 
and 
real 
structure 
one 
is 
not 
familiar 
creates 
in 
itself 
a 
feeling 
of 
anxiety. 
To 
remove 
this 
anguish 
and 
to 
give 
men 
certainty 
about 
the 
last 
things 
has 
been 
from 
the 
earliest 
days 
the 
solicitude 
of 
religion 
and 
metaphysics. 
Later 
the 
philosophy 
of 
the 
Enlightenment 
and 
its 
affiliated 
schools 
promised 
that 
the 
natural 
sciences 
would 
solve 
all 
the 
problems 
involved. 
At 
any 
rate, 
it 
is 
a 
fact 
that 
to 
brood 
over 
the 
origin 
and 
essence 
of 
things, 
man’s 
nature 
and 
his 
role 
in 
the 
universe, 
is 
one 
of 
the 
concerns 
of 
many 
people. 
Seen 
from 
this 
angle, 
the 
pure 
search 
for 
knowledge, 
not 
motivated 
by 
the 
desire 
to 
improve 
the 
external 
conditions 
of 
life, 
is 
also 
action, 
i.e., 
an 
effort 
to 
attain 
a 
more 
desirable 
state 
of 
affairs. 


Another 
question 
is 
whether 
the 
human 
mind 
is 
fitted 
for 
the 
full 
solution 
of 
the 
problems 
involved. 
It 
may 
be 
argued 
that 
the 
biological 
function 
of 
reason 
is 
to 
aid 
man 
in 
his 
struggle 
for 
survival 
and 
the 
removal 
of 
uneasiness. 
Any 
step 
beyond 
the 
limits 
drawn 
by 
this 
function, 
it 
is 
said, 
leads 
to 
fantastic 
metaphysical 
speculations 
which 
are 
liable 
neither 
to 
demonstration 
nor 
to 
refutation. 
Omniscience 
is 
forever 
denied 
to 
man. 
Every 
search 
for 
truth 
must, 
sooner 
or 
later, 
but 
inevitably, 
lead 
to 
an 
ultimate 
given.1 


The 
category 
of 
action 
is 
the 
fundamental 
category 
of 
human 
knowledge. 
It 
implies 
all 
the 
categories 
of 
logic 
and 
the 
category 
of 
regularity 
and 
causality. 
It 
implies 
the 
category 
of 
time 
and 
that 
of 
value. 
It 
encompasses 
all 
the 
specific 
manifestations 
of 
human 
life 
as 
distinguished 
from 
the 
manifestations 
of 
man’s 
physiological 
structure 
which 
he 
has 
in 
common 
with 
all 
other 
animals. 
In 
acting, 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
individual 
sees 
itself 
as 
different 
from 
its 
environment, 
the 
external 
world, 
and 
tries 
to 
study 
this 
environment 
in 
order 
to 
influence 
the 
course 
of 
the 
events 
happening 
in 
it. 


2. 
Finality 
What 
distinguishes 
the 
field 
of 
human 
action 
from 
the 
field 
of 
external 
events 
as 
investigated 
by 
the 
natural 
sciences 
is 
the 
category 
of 
finality. 
We 
do 
no 
know 
of 
any 
final 
causes 
operating 
in 
what 
we 
call 
nature. 
But 
we 
know 
that 
man 
aims 
at 
definite 
goals 
chosen. 
In 
the 
natural 
sciences 
we 



search 
after 
constant 
relations 
among 
various 
events. 
In 
dealing 
with 
human 
action 
we 
search 
after 
the 
ends 
the 
actor 
wants 
or 
wanted 
to 
attain 
and 
after 
the 
result 
that 
his 
action 
brought 
about 
or 
will 
bring 
about. 


The 
clear 
distinction 
between 
a 
field 
of 
reality 
about 
which 
man 
cannot 
learn 
anything 
else 
than 
that 
it 
is 
characterized 
by 
a 
regularity 
in 
the 
concatenation 
and 
succession 
of 
events 
and 
a 
field 
in 
which 
purposeful 
striving 
after 
ends 
chosen 
takes 
place 
is 
an 
achievement 
of 
a 
long 
evolution. 
Man, 
himself 
an 
acting 
being, 
was 
first 
inclined 
to 
explain 
all 
events 
as 
the 
manifestation 
of 
the 
action 
of 
beings 
acting 
in 
a 
way 
that 
was 
essentially 
not 
different 
from 
his 
own. 
Animism 
ascribed 
to 
all 
things 
of 
the 
universe 
the 
faculty 
of 
action. 
When 
experience 
moved 
people 
to 
drop 
this 
belief, 
it 
was 
still 
assumed 
that 
God 
or 
nature 
acts 
in 
a 
way 
not 
different 
from 
the 
ways 
of 
human 
action. 
The 
emancipation 
from 
this 
anthropomorphism 
is 
one 
of 
the 
epistemological 
foundations 
of 
modern 
natural 
science. 


Positivist 
philosophy, 
which 
nowadays 
styles 
itself 
also 
scientific 
philosophy, 
believes 
that 
this 
rejection 
of 
finalism 
by 
the 
natural 
sciences 
implies 
the 
refutation 
of 
all 
theological 
doctrines 
as 
well 
as 
that 
of 
the 
teachings 
of 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action. 
It 
pretends 
that 
the 
natural 
sciences 
can 
solve 
all 
the 
“riddles 
of 
the 
universe” 
and 
provide 
an 
allegedly 
scientific 
answer 
to 
all 
the 
questions 
that 
may 
trouble 
mankind. 


However, 
the 
natural 
sciences 
did 
not 
contribute 
and 
cannot 
contribute 
anything 
to 
the 
clarification 
of 
those 
problems 
with 
which 
religion 
tries 
to 
cope. 
The 
repudiation 
of 
naive 
anthropomorphism 
that 
imagined 
a 
supreme 
being 
either 
as 
a 
dictator 
or 
as 
a 
watchmaker 
was 
an 
achievement 
of 
theology 
and 
of 
metaphysics. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
doctrine 
that 
God 
is 
wholly 
other 
than 
man 
and 
that 
his 
essence 
and 
nature 
cannot 
be 
grasped 
by 
mortal 
man, 
the 
natural 
sciences 
and 
a 
philosophy 
derived 
from 
them 
have 
nothing 
to 
say. 
The 
transcendent 
is 
beyond 
the 
realm 
about 
which 
physics 
and 
physiology 
convey 
information. 
Logic 
can 
neither 
prove 
nor 
disprove 
the 
core 
of 
theological 
doctrines. 
All 
that 
science—apart 
from 
history—can 
do 
in 
this 
regard 
is 
to 
expose 
the 
fallacies 
of 
magic 
and 
fetishistic 
superstitions 
and 
practices. 


In 
denying 
the 
autonomy 
of 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
and 
their 
category 
of 
final 
causes, 
positivism 
enounces 
a 
metaphysical 
postulate 
that 
it 
cannot 
substantiate 
with 
any 
of 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
experimental 
methods 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
It 
is 
a 
gratuitous 
pastime 
to 
apply 
to 
the 
description 
of 
the 
behavior 
of 
man 
the 
same 
methods 
the 
natural 
sciences 
apply 
in 
dealing 



with 
the 
behavior 
of 
mice 
or 
of 
iron. 
The 
same 
external 
events 
produce 
in 
different 
men 
and 
in 
the 
same 
men 
at 
different 
times 
different 
reactions. 
The 
natural 
sciences 
are 
helpless 
in 
face 
of 
this 
“irregularity.” 
Their 
methods 
can 
deal 
only 
with 
events 
that 
are 
governed 
by 
a 
regular 
pattern. 
Besides, 
they 
do 
not 
have 
any 
room 
for 
the 
concepts 
of 
meaning, 
of 
valuation, 
and 
of 
ends. 


3. 
Valuation 
Valuing 
is 
man’s 
emotional 
reaction 
to 
the 
various 
states 
of 
his 
environment, 
both 
that 
of 
the 
external 
world 
and 
that 
of 
the 
physiological 
conditions 
of 
his 
own 
body. 
Man 
distinguishes 
between 
more 
and 
less 
desirable 
states, 
as 
the 
optimists 
may 
express 
it, 
or 
between 
greater 
and 
lesser 
evils, 
as 
the 
pessimists 
are 
prepared 
to 
say. 
He 
acts 
when 
he 
believes 
that 
action 
can 
result 
in 
substituting 
a 
more 
desirable 
state 
for 
a 
less 
desirable. 


The 
failure 
of 
the 
attempts 
to 
apply 
the 
methods 
and 
the 
epistemological 
principles 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
to 
the 
problems 
of 
human 
action 
is 
caused 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
these 
sciences 
have 
no 
tool 
to 
deal 
with 
valuing. 
In 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
phenomena 
they 
study 
there 
is 
no 
room 
for 
any 
purposive 
behavior. 
The 
physicist 
himself 
and 
his 
physical 
research 
are 
entities 
outside 
the 
orbit 
he 
investigates. 
Judgments 
of 
value 
cannot 
be 
perceived 
by 
the 
observational 
attitudes 
of 
the 
experimenter 
and 
cannot 
be 
described 
in 
the 
protocol 
sentences 
of 
the 
language 
of 
physics. 
Yet 
they 
are, 
also 
from 
the 
viewpoint 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences, 
real 
phenomena, 
as 
they 
are 
a 
necessary 
link 
in 
chains 
of 
events 
that 
produce 
definite 
physical 
phenomena. 


The 
physicist 
may 
laugh 
today 
at 
the 
doctrine 
that 
interpreted 
certain 
phenomena 
as 
the 
effect 
of 
a 
horror 
vacui. 
But 
he 
fails 
to 
realize 
that 
the 
postulates 
of 
panphysicalism 
are 
no 
less 
ridiculous. 
If 
one 
eliminates 
any 
reference 
to 
judgments 
of 
value, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
say 
anything 
about 
the 
actions 
of 
man, 
i.e., 
about 
all 
the 
behavior 
that 
is 
not 
merely 
the 
consummation 
of 
physiological 
processes 
taking 
place 
in 
the 
human 
body. 


4. 
The 
Chimera 
of 
Unified 
Science 
The 
aim 
of 
all 
brands 
of 
positivism 
is 
to 
silence 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
argument 
we 
may 
abstain 
from 
analyzing 
positivism’s 
contributions 
to 
the 
epistemology 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
both 
with 
regard 
to 
their 
originality 
and 
to 
their 
soundness. 
Neither 
do 
we 
have 
to 
dwell 
too 
long 



upon 
the 
motives 
that 
incited 
the 
positivist 
authors’ 
passionate 
attacks 
upon 
the 
“unscientific 
procedure” 
of 
economics 
and 
history. 
They 
are 
advocating 
definite 
political, 
economic 
and 
cultural 
reforms 
which, 
as 
they 
believe, 
will 
bring 
about 
the 
salvation 
of 
mankind 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
eternal 
bliss. 
As 
they 
cannot 
refute 
the 
devastating 
criticism 
that 
their 
fantastic 
plans 
met 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
economists, 
they 
want 
to 
suppress 
the 
“dismal 
science.” 


The 
question 
whether 
the 
term 
“science” 
ought 
to 
be 
applied 
only 
to 
the 
natural 
sciences 
or 
also 
to 
praxeology 
and 
to 
history 
is 
merely 
linguistic 
and 
its 
solution 
differs 
with 
the 
usages 
of 
various 
languages. 
In 
English 
the 
term 
science 
for 
many 
people 
refers 
only 
to 
the 
natural 
sciences.2 
In 
German 
it 
is 
customary 
to 
speak 
of 
a 
Geschichtswissenschaft 
and 
to 
call 
various 
branches 
of 
history 
Wissenschaft, 
such 
as 
Literaturwissenschaft, 
Sprachwissenschaft, 
Kunstwissenschaft, 
Kriegswissenschaft. 
One 
can 
dismiss 
the 
problem 
as 
merely 
verbal, 
an 
inane 
quibbling 
about 
words. 


Auguste 
Comte 
postulated 
an 
empirical 
science 
of 
sociology 
which, 
modelled 
after 
the 
scheme 
of 
classical 
mechanics, 
should 
deal 
with 
the 
laws 
of 
society 
and 
social 
facts. 
The 
many 
hundreds 
and 
thousands 
of 
the 
adepts 
of 
Comte 
call 
themselves 
sociologists 
and 
the 
books 
they 
are 
publishing 
contributions 
to 
sociology. 
In 
fact, 
they 
deal 
with 
various 
hitherto 
more 
or 
less 
neglected 
chapters 
of 
history 
and 
by 
and 
large 
proceed 
according 
to 
the 
well-tried 
methods 
of 
historical 
and 
ethnological 
research. 
It 
is 
immaterial 
whether 
they 
mention 
in 
the 
title 
of 
their 
books 
the 
period 
and 
the 
geographical 
area 
with 
which 
they 
are 
dealing. 
Their 
“empirical” 
studies 
necessarily 
always 
refer 
to 
a 
definite 
epoch 
of 
history 
and 
describe 
phenomena 
that 
come 
into 
existence, 
change, 
and 
disappear 
in 
the 
flux 
of 
time. 
The 
methods 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
cannot 
be 
applied 
to 
human 
behavior 
because 
this 
behavior, 
apart 
from 
what 
qualifies 
it 
as 
human 
action 
and 
is 
studied 
by 
the 
a 
priori 
science 
of 
praxeology, 
lacks 
the 
peculiarity 
that 
characterizes 
events 
in 
the 
field 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences, 
viz., 
regularity. 


There 
is 
no 
way 
either 
to 
confirm 
or 
to 
reject 
by 
discursive 
reasoning 
the 
metaphysical 
ideas 
that 
are 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
blatantly 
advertised 
program 
of 
“Unified 
Science” 
as 
expounded 
in 
the 
International 
Encyclopedia 
of 
Unified 
Science, 
the 
holy 
writ 
of 
logical 
positivism, 
panphysicalism, 
and 
intolerant 
empiricism. 
Paradoxically 
enough, 
these 
doctrines, 
which 
started 
from 
a 
radical 
rejection 
of 
history, 
ask 
us 
to 
look 
upon 
all 
events 
as 
part 
of 
the 
subject 
matter 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
cosmic 
history. 
What 
we 
know 
about 
natural 
events, 
e.g., 
the 
behavior 
of 
sodium 
and 
levers, 
may, 
as 
they 
say, 
be 



valid 
only 
for 
the 
period 
of 
cosmic 
aggregation 
in 
which 
we 
ourselves 
and 
earlier 
generations 
of 
scientists 
lived. 
There 
is 
no 
reason 
whatever 
to 
assign 
to 
chemical 
and 
mechanical 
statements 
“any 
kind 
of 
universality” 
instead 
of 
treating 
them 
as 
historical 
ones.3 
Seen 
from 
this 
point 
of 
view, 
the 
natural 
sciences 
turn 
into 
a 
chapter 
of 
cosmic 
history. 
There 
is 
no 
conflict 
between 
physicalism 
and 
cosmic 
history. 


We 
must 
admit 
that 
we 
do 
not 
know 
anything 
about 
conditions 
in 
a 
period 
of 
cosmic 
history 
for 
which 
the 
statements 
of 
what 
we 
call 
in 
our 
period 
the 
natural 
sciences 
will 
no 
longer 
be 
valid. 
In 
speaking 
about 
science 
and 
knowledge 
we 
have 
in 
mind 
only 
the 
conditions 
that 
our 
living, 
thinking, 
and 
acting 
permit 
us 
to 
investigate. 
What 
is 
beyond 
the 
conditions 
of 
this— 
perhaps 
temporarily 
limited—state 
of 
affairs 
is 
for 
us 
an 
unknown 
and 
unknowable 
region. 
In 
that 
sector 
of 
the 
universe 
which 
is 
accessible 
to 
our 
searching 
mind 
there 
prevails 
a 
dualism 
in 
the 
succession 
and 
concatenation 
of 
events. 
There 
is, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
the 
field 
of 
external 
events, 
about 
which 
we 
can 
learn 
only 
that 
there 
prevail 
mutual 
constant 
relations 
among 
them, 
and 
there 
is 
the 
field 
of 
human 
action, 
about 
which 
we 
cannot 
learn 
anything 
without 
resorting 
to 
the 
category 
of 
finality. 
All 
attempts 
to 
disregard 
this 
dualism 
are 
dictated 
by 
arbitrary 
metaphysical 
prepossessions, 
bring 
forth 
merely 
nonsense, 
and 
are 
useless 
for 
practical 
action. 


The 
difference 
that 
exists 
in 
our 
environment 
between 
the 
behavior 
of 
sodium 
and 
that 
of 
an 
author 
who 
in 
his 
writings 
refers 
to 
sodium 
cannot 
be 
wiped 
out 
by 
any 
reference 
to 
the 
possibility 
that 
there 
were 
once 
or 
will 
be 
in 
the 
future 
periods 
of 
cosmic 
history 
about 
the 
conditions 
of 
which 
we 
do 
not 
know 
anything. 
All 
our 
knowledge 
must 
take 
into 
account 
the 
fact 
that 
with 
regard 
to 
sodium 
we 
do 
not 
know 
anything 
about 
final 
causes 
directing 
its 
behavior, 
while 
we 
know 
that 
man, 
e.g., 
in 
writing 
an 
essay 
about 
sodium, 
aims 
at 
definite 
ends. 
The 
attempts 
of 
behaviorism 
(or 
“behavioristics” 
4) 
to 
deal 
with 
human 
action 
according 
to 
the 
stimulus-response 
scheme 
have 
failed 
lamentably. 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
describe 
any 
human 
action 
if 
one 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
the 
meaning 
the 
actor 
sees 
in 
the 
stimulus 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
end 
his 
response 
is 
aiming 
at. 


We 
know 
also 
the 
end 
that 
impels 
the 
champions 
of 
all 
these 
fads 
that 
nowadays 
parade 
under 
the 
name 
of 
Unified 
Science. 
Their 
authors 
are 
driven 
by 
the 
dictatorial 
complex. 
They 
want 
to 
deal 
with 
their 
fellow 
men 
in 
the 
way 
an 
engineer 
deals 
with 
the 
materials 
out 
of 
which 
he 
builds 
houses, 
bridges, 
and 
machines. 
They 
want 
to 
substitute 
“social 
engineering” 
for 
the 



actions 
of 
their 
fellow 
citizens 
and 
their 
own 
unique 
all-comprehensive 
plan 
for 
the 
plans 
of 
all 
other 
people. 
They 
see 
themselves 
in 
the 
role 
of 
the 
dictator—the 
duce, 
the 
Führer, 
the 
production 
tsar—in 
whose 
hands 
all 
other 
specimens 
of 
mankind 
are 
merely 
pawns. 
If 
they 
refer 
to 
society 
as 
an 
acting 
agent, 
they 
mean 
themselves. 
If 
they 
say 
that 
conscious 
action 
of 
society 
is 
to 
be 
substituted 
for 
the 
prevailing 
anarchy 
of 
individualism, 
they 
mean 
their 
own 
consciousness 
alone 
and 
not 
that 
of 
anybody 
else. 


5. 
The 
Two 
Branches 
of 
the 
Sciences 
of 
Human 
Action 
There 
are 
two 
branches 
of 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action, 
praxeology 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
history 
on 
the 
other 
hand. 


Praxeology 
is 
a 
priori. 
It 
starts 
from 
the 
a 
priori 
category 
of 
action 
and 
develops 
out 
of 
it 
all 
that 
it 
contains. 
For 
practical 
reasons 
praxeology 
does 
not 
as 
a 
rule 
pay 
much 
attention 
to 
those 
problems 
that 
are 
of 
no 
use 
for 
the 
study 
of 
the 
reality 
of 
man’s 
action, 
but 
restricts 
its 
work 
to 
those 
problems 
that 
are 
necessary 
for 
the 
elucidation 
of 
what 
is 
going 
on 
in 
reality. 
Its 
intent 
is 
to 
deal 
with 
action 
taking 
place 
under 
conditions 
that 
acting 
man 
has 
to 
face. 
This 
does 
not 
alter 
the 
purely 
aprioristic 
character 
of 
praxeology. 
It 
merely 
circumscribes 
the 
field 
that 
the 
individual 
praxeologists 
customarily 
choose 
for 
their 
work. 
They 
refer 
to 
experience 
only 
in 
order 
to 
separate 
those 
problems 
that 
are 
of 
interest 
for 
the 
study 
of 
man 
as 
he 
really 
is 
and 
acts 
from 
other 
problems 
that 
offer 
a 
merely 
academic 
interest. 
The 
answer 
to 
the 
question 
whether 
or 
not 
definite 
theorems 
of 
praxeology 
apply 
to 
a 
definite 
problem 
of 
action 
depends 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
fact 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
special 
assumptions 
that 
characterize 
this 
theorem 
are 
of 
any 
value 
for 
the 
cognition 
of 
reality. 
To 
be 
sure, 
it 
does 
not 
depend 
on 
the 
answer 
to 
the 
question 
whether 
or 
not 
these 
assumptions 
correspond 
to 
the 
real 
state 
of 
affairs 
that 
the 
praxeologists 
want 
to 
investigate. 
The 
imaginary 
constructions 
that 
are 
the 
main—or, 
as 
some 
people 
would 
rather 
say, 
the 
only—mental 
tool 
of 
praxeology 
describe 
conditions 
that 
can 
never 
be 
present 
in 
the 
reality 
of 
action. 
Yet 
they 
are 
indispensable 
for 
conceiving 
what 
is 
going 
on 
in 
this 
reality. 
Even 
the 
most 
bigoted 
advocates 
of 
an 
empiricist 
interpretation 
of 
the 
methods 
of 
economics 
employ 
the 
imaginary 
construction 
of 
an 
evenly 
rotating 
economy 
(static 
equilibrium), 
although 
such 
a 
state 
of 
human 
affairs 
can 
never 
be 
realized.5 


Following 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
Kant’s 
analyses, 
philosophers 
raised 
the 



question: 
How 
can 
the 
human 
mind, 
by 
aprioristic 
thinking, 
deal 
with 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
external 
world? 
As 
far 
as 
praxeology 
is 
concerned, 
the 
answer 
is 
obvious. 
Both, 
a 
priori 
thinking 
and 
reasoning 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
and 
human 
action 
on 
the 
other, 
are 
manifestations 
of 
the 
human 
mind. 
The 
logical 
structure 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
creates 
the 
reality 
of 
action. 
Reason 
and 
action 
are 
congeneric 
and 
homogeneous, 
two 
aspects 
of 
the 
same 
phenomenon. 
In 
this 
sense 
we 
may 
apply 
to 
praxeology 
the 
dictum 
of 
Empedocles 
γνῶσις 
τοῦ 
ὁμοίου 
τῷ 
ὁμοίῳ. 


Some 
authors 
have 
raised 
the 
rather 
shallow 
question 
how 
a 
praxeologist 
would 
react 
to 
an 
experience 
contradicting 
theorems 
of 
his 
aprioristic 
doctrine. 
The 
answer 
is: 
in 
the 
same 
way 
in 
which 
a 
mathematician 
will 
react 
to 
the 
“experience” 
that 
there 
is 
no 
difference 
between 
two 
apples 
and 
seven 
apples 
or 
a 
logician 
to 
the 
“experience” 
that 
A 
and 
non-A 
are 
identical. 
Experience 
concerning 
human 
action 
presupposes 
the 
category 
of 
human 
action 
and 
all 
that 
derives 
from 
it. 
If 
one 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
the 
system 
of 
the 
praxeological 
a 
priori, 
one 
must 
not 
and 
cannot 
talk 
of 
action, 
but 
merely 
of 
events 
that 
are 
to 
be 
described 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
Awareness 
of 
the 
problems 
with 
which 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
are 
concerned 
is 
conditioned 
by 
familiarity 
with 
the 
a 
priori 
categories 
of 
praxeology. 
Incidentally, 
we 
may 
also 
remark 
that 
any 
experience 
in 
the 
field 
of 
human 
action 
is 
specifically 
historical 
experience, 
i.e., 
the 
experience 
of 
complex 
phenomena, 
which 
can 
never 
falsify 
any 
theorem 
in 
the 
way 
a 
laboratory 
experiment 
can 
do 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
statements 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences. 


Up 
to 
now 
the 
only 
part 
of 
praxeology 
that 
has 
been 
developed 
into 
a 
scientific 
system 
is 
economics. 
A 
Polish 
philosopher, 
Tadeusz 
Kotarbiński, 
is 
trying 
to 
develop 
a 
new 
branch 
of 
praxeology, 
the 
praxeological 
theory 
of 
conflict 
and 
war 
as 
opposed 
to 
the 
theory 
of 
cooperation 
or 
economics.6 


The 
other 
branch 
of 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
is 
history. 
It 
comprehends 
the 
totality 
of 
what 
is 
experienced 
about 
human 
action. 
It 
is 
the 
methodically 
arranged 
record 
of 
human 
action, 
the 
description 
of 
the 
phenomena 
as 
they 
happened, 
viz., 
in 
the 
past. 
What 
distinguishes 
the 
descriptions 
of 
history 
from 
those 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
is 
that 
they 
are 
not 
interpreted 
in 
the 
light 
of 
the 
category 
of 
regularity. 
When 
the 
physicist 
says: 
if 
A 
encounters 
B, 
C 
results, 
he 
wants, 
whatever 
philosophers 
may 
say, 
to 
assert 
that 
C 
will 
emerge 
whenever 
or 
wherever 
A 
will 
encounter 
B 
under 
analogous 
conditions. 
When 
the 
historian 
refers 
to 
the 
battle 
of 
Cannae, 
he 
knows 
that 
he 
is 
talking 
about 
the 
past 
and 
that 
this 
particular 
battle 
will 



never 
be 
fought 
again. 


Experience 
is 
a 
uniform 
mental 
activity. 
There 
are 
not 
two 
different 
branches 
of 
experience, 
one 
resorted 
to 
in 
the 
natural 
sciences, 
the 
other 
in 
historical 
research. 
Every 
act 
of 
experience 
is 
a 
description 
of 
what 
happened 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
observer’s 
logical 
and 
praxeological 
equipment 
and 
his 
knowledge 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
It 
is 
the 
observer’s 
attitude 
that 
interprets 
the 
experience 
by 
adding 
it 
to 
his 
own 
already 
previously 
accumulated 
store 
of 
experienced 
facts. 
What 
distinguishes 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
historian 
from 
that 
of 
the 
naturalist 
and 
the 
physicist 
is 
that 
he 
searches 
for 
the 
meaning 
that 
the 
event 
had 
or 
has 
for 
those 
who 
were 
either 
instrumental 
in 
bringing 
it 
about 
or 
were 
affected 
by 
its 
happening. 


The 
natural 
sciences 
do 
not 
know 
anything 
about 
final 
causes. 
For 
praxeology 
finality 
is 
the 
fundamental 
category. 
But 
praxeology 
abstracts 
from 
the 
concrete 
content 
of 
the 
ends 
men 
are 
aiming 
at. 
It 
is 
history 
that 
deals 
with 
the 
concrete 
ends. 
For 
history 
the 
main 
question 
is: 
What 
was 
the 
meaning 
the 
actors 
attached 
to 
the 
situation 
in 
which 
they 
found 
themselves 
and 
what 
was 
the 
meaning 
of 
their 
reaction, 
and, 
finally, 
what 
was 
the 
result 
of 
these 
actions? 
The 
autonomy 
of 
history 
or, 
as 
we 
may 
say, 
of 
the 
various 
historical 
disciplines 
consists 
in 
their 
dedication 
to 
the 
study 
of 
meaning. 


It 
is 
perhaps 
not 
superfluous 
to 
emphasize 
again 
and 
again 
that 
when 
historians 
say 
“meaning,” 
they 
refer 
to 
the 
meaning 
individual 
men—the 
actors 
themselves 
and 
those 
affected 
by 
their 
actions 
or 
the 
historians—saw 
in 
the 
actions. 
History 
as 
such 
has 
nothing 
in 
common 
with 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
philosophies 
of 
history 
that 
pretend 
to 
know 
the 
meaning 
that 
God 
or 
a 
quasi-God—such 
as 
the 
material 
productive 
forces 
in 
the 
scheme 
of 
Marx— 
attaches 
to 
the 
various 
events. 


6. 
The 
Logical 
Character 
of 
Praxeology 
Praxeology 
is 
a 
priori. 
All 
its 
theorems 
are 
products 
of 
deductive 
reasoning 
that 
starts 
from 
the 
category 
of 
action. 
The 
questions 
whether 
the 
judgments 
of 
praxeology 
are 
to 
be 
called 
analytic 
or 
synthetic 
and 
whether 
or 
not 
its 
procedure 
is 
to 
be 
qualified 
as 
“merely” 
tautological 
are 
of 
verbal 
interest 
only. 


What 
praxeology 
asserts 
with 
regard 
to 
human 
action 
in 
general 
is 
strictly 
valid 
without 
any 
exception 
for 
every 
action. 
There 
is 
action 
and 
there 
is 
the 
absence 
of 
action, 
but 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
between. 
Every 
action 
is 
an 



attempt 
to 
exchange 
one 
state 
of 
affairs 
for 
another, 
and 
everything 
that 
praxeology 
affirms 
with 
regard 
to 
exchange 
refers 
strictly 
to 
it. 
In 
dealing 
with 
every 
action 
we 
encounter 
the 
fundamental 
concepts 
end 
and 
means, 
success 
or 
failure, 
profit 
or 
loss, 
costs. 
An 
exchange 
can 
be 
either 
direct 
or 
indirect, 
i.e., 
effected 
through 
the 
interposition 
of 
an 
intermediary 
stage. 
Whether 
a 
definite 
action 
was 
indirect 
exchange 
has 
to 
be 
determined 
by 
experience. 
But 
if 
it 
was 
indirect 
exchange, 
then 
all 
that 
praxeology 
says 
about 
indirect 
exchange 
in 
general 
strictly 
applies 
to 
it. 


Every 
theorem 
of 
praxeology 
is 
deduced 
by 
logical 
reasoning 
from 
the 
category 
of 
action. 
It 
partakes 
of 
the 
apodictic 
certainty 
provided 
by 
logical 
reasoning 
that 
starts 
from 
an 
a 
priori 
category. 


Into 
the 
chain 
of 
praxeological 
reasoning 
the 
praxeologist 
introduces 
certain 
assumptions 
concerning 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
environment 
in 
which 
an 
action 
takes 
place. 
Then 
he 
tries 
to 
find 
out 
how 
these 
special 
conditions 
affect 
the 
result 
to 
which 
his 
reasoning 
must 
lead. 
The 
question 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
real 
conditions 
of 
the 
external 
world 
correspond 
to 
these 
assumptions 
is 
to 
be 
answered 
by 
experience. 
But 
if 
the 
answer 
is 
in 
the 
affirmative, 
all 
the 
conclusions 
drawn 
by 
logically 
correct 
praxeological 
reasoning 
strictly 
describe 
what 
is 
going 
on 
in 
reality. 


7. 
The 
Logical 
Character 
of 
History 
History 
in 
the 
broadest 
sense 
of 
the 
term 
is 
the 
totality 
of 
human 
experience. 
History 
is 
experience, 
and 
all 
experience 
is 
historical. 
History 
comprehends 
also 
all 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
What 
characterizes 
the 
natural 
sciences 
as 
such 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
approach 
the 
material 
of 
experience 
with 
the 
category 
of 
a 
strict 
regularity 
in 
the 
succession 
of 
events. 
History 
in 
the 
narrower 
sense 
of 
the 
term, 
i.e., 
the 
totality 
of 
experience 
concerning 
human 
action, 
must 
not 
and 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
this 
category. 
This 
distinguishes 
it 
epistemologically 
from 
the 
natural 
sciences. 


Experience 
is 
always 
experience 
of 
the 
past. 
There 
is 
no 
experience 
and 
no 
history 
of 
the 
future. 
It 
would 
be 
unnecessary 
to 
repeat 
this 
truism 
if 
it 
were 
not 
for 
the 
problem 
of 
business 
forecasting 
by 
statisticians, 
about 
which 
something 
will 
be 
said 
later.7 


History 
is 
the 
record 
of 
human 
actions. 
It 
establishes 
the 
fact 
that 
men, 
inspired 
by 
definite 
ideas, 
made 
definite 
judgments 
of 
value, 
chose 
definite 



ends, 
and 
resorted 
to 
definite 
means 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
the 
ends 
chosen, 
and 
it 
deals 
furthermore 
with 
the 
outcome 
of 
their 
actions, 
the 
state 
of 
affairs 
the 
action 
brought 
about. 


What 
distinguishes 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
from 
the 
natural 
sciences 
is 
not 
the 
events 
investigated, 
but 
the 
way 
they 
are 
looked 
upon. 
The 
same 
event 
appears 
different 
when 
seen 
in 
the 
light 
of 
history 
and 
when 
seen 
in 
the 
light 
of 
physics 
or 
biology. 
What 
interests 
the 
historian 
in 
a 
case 
of 
murder 
or 
in 
a 
fire 
is 
not 
what 
interests 
the 
physiologist 
or 
the 
chemist 
if 
they 
are 
not 
acting 
as 
experts 
for 
a 
court 
of 
law. 
To 
the 
historian 
the 
events 
of 
the 
external 
world 
that 
are 
studied 
by 
the 
natural 
sciences 
count 
only 
as 
far 
as 
they 
affect 
human 
action 
or 
are 
produced 
by 
it. 


The 
ultimate 
given 
in 
history 
is 
called 
individuality. 
When 
the 
historian 
reaches 
the 
point 
beyond 
which 
he 
cannot 
go 
farther, 
he 
refers 
to 
individuality. 
He 
“explains” 
an 
event—the 
origin 
of 
an 
idea 
or 
the 
performance 
of 
an 
action—by 
tracing 
it 
back 
to 
the 
activity 
of 
one 
man 
or 
of 
a 
multitude 
of 
men. 
Here 
he 
faces 
the 
barrier 
that 
prevents 
the 
natural 
sciences 
from 
dealing 
with 
the 
actions 
of 
men, 
viz., 
our 
inability 
to 
learn 
how 
definite 
external 
events 
produce 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
men 
definite 
reactions, 
i.e., 
ideas 
and 
volitions. 


Futile 
attempts 
have 
been 
made 
to 
trace 
back 
human 
action 
to 
factors 
that 
can 
be 
described 
by 
the 
methods 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
Stressing 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
urge 
to 
preserve 
one’s 
own 
life 
and 
to 
propagate 
one’s 
own 
species 
is 
inwrought 
in 
every 
creature, 
hunger 
and 
sex 
were 
proclaimed 
as 
the 
foremost 
or 
even 
as 
the 
only 
springs 
of 
human 
action. 
However, 
one 
could 
not 
deny 
that 
there 
prevail 
considerable 
differences 
between 
the 
way 
in 
which 
these 
biological 
urges 
affect 
the 
behavior 
of 
man 
and 
that 
of 
nonhuman 
beings 
and 
that 
man, 
besides 
aiming 
at 
satisfying 
his 
animal 
impulses, 
is 
also 
intent 
upon 
attaining 
other 
ends 
that 
are 
specifically 
human 
and 
therefore 
usually 
styled 
higher 
ends. 
That 
the 
physiological 
structure 
of 
the 
human 
body—first 
of 
all 
the 
appetites 
of 
the 
belly 
and 
of 
the 
sex 
glands—affects 
the 
choices 
of 
acting 
man 
has 
never 
been 
forgotten 
by 
the 
historians. 
After 
all, 
man 
is 
an 
animal. 
But 
he 
is 
the 
acting 
animal; 
he 
chooses 
between 
conflicting 
ends. 
It 
is 
precisely 
this 
that 
is 
the 
theme 
both 
of 
praxeology 
and 
of 
history. 


8. 
The 
Thymological 
Method 
The 
environment 
in 
which 
man 
acts 
is 
shaped 
by 
natural 
events 
on 
the 



one 
hand 
and 
by 
human 
action 
on 
the 
other. 
The 
future 
for 
which 
he 
plans 
will 
be 
codetermined 
by 
the 
actions 
of 
people 
who 
are 
planning 
and 
acting 
like 
himself. 
If 
he 
wants 
to 
succeed, 
he 
must 
anticipate 
their 
conduct. 


The 
uncertainty 
of 
the 
future 
is 
caused 
not 
only 
by 
uncertainty 
concerning 
the 
future 
actions 
of 
other 
people, 
but 
also 
by 
insufficient 
knowledge 
concerning 
many 
natural 
events 
that 
are 
important 
for 
action. 
Meteorology 
provides 
some 
information 
about 
the 
factors 
that 
determine 
atmospheric 
conditions; 
but 
this 
knowledge 
at 
best 
enables 
the 
expert 
to 
predict 
the 
weather 
with 
some 
likelihood 
for 
a 
few 
days, 
never 
for 
longer 
periods. 
There 
are 
other 
fields 
in 
which 
man’s 
foresight 
is 
even 
more 
limited. 
All 
that 
man 
can 
do 
in 
dealing 
with 
such 
insufficiently 
known 
conditions 
is 
to 
use 
what 
the 
natural 
sciences 
give 
him, 
however 
scanty 
this 
may 
be. 


Radically 
different 
from 
the 
methods 
applied 
in 
dealing 
with 
natural 
events 
are 
those 
resorted 
to 
by 
man 
in 
anticipating 
the 
conduct 
of 
his 
fellow 
men. 
Philosophy 
and 
science 
for 
a 
long 
time 
paid 
little 
attention 
to 
these 
methods. 
They 
were 
considered 
as 
unscientific 
and 
not 
worthy 
of 
notice 
on 
the 
part 
of 
serious 
thinkers. 
When 
philosophers 
began 
to 
deal 
with 
them, 
they 
called 
them 
psychological. 
But 
this 
term 
became 
inappropriate 
when 
the 
techniques 
of 
experimental 
psychology 
were 
developed 
and 
almost 
all 
that 
earlier 
generations 
had 
called 
psychology 
was 
either 
altogether 
rejected 
as 
unscientific 
or 
assigned 
to 
a 
class 
of 
pursuits 
contemptuously 
styled 
as 
“mere 
literature” 
or 
“literary 
psychology.” 
The 
champions 
of 
experimental 
psychology 
were 
confident 
that 
one 
day 
their 
laboratory 
experiments 
would 
provide 
a 
scientific 
solution 
of 
all 
the 
problems 
about 
which, 
as 
they 
said, 
the 
traditional 
sciences 
of 
human 
behavior 
babbled 
in 
childish 
or 
metaphysical 
talk. 


In 
fact, 
experimental 
psychology 
has 
nothing 
to 
say 
and 
never 
did 
say 
anything 
about 
the 
problems 
that 
people 
have 
in 
mind 
when 
they 
refer 
to 
psychology 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
actions 
of 
their 
fellow 
men. 
The 
primary 
and 
central 
problem 
of 
“literary 
psychology” 
is 
meaning, 
something 
that 
is 
beyond 
the 
pale 
of 
any 
natural 
science 
and 
any 
laboratory 
activities. 
While 
experimental 
psychology 
is 
a 
branch 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences, 
“literary 
psychology” 
deals 
with 
human 
action, 
viz., 
with 
the 
ideas, 
judgments 
of 
value, 
and 
volitions 
that 
determine 
action. 
As 
the 
term 
“literary 
psychology” 
is 
rather 
cumbersome 
and 
does 
not 
permit 
one 
to 
form 
a 
corresponding 
adjective, 
I 
have 
suggested 
substituting 
for 
it 
the 
term 
thymology.8 


Thymology 
is 
a 
branch 
of 
history 
or, 
as 
Collingwood 
formulated 
it, 
it 



belongs 
in 
“the 
sphere 
of 
history.”9 
It 
deals 
with 
the 
mental 
activities 
of 
men 
that 
determine 
their 
actions. 
It 
deals 
with 
the 
mental 
processes 
that 
result 
in 
a 
definite 
kind 
of 
behavior, 
with 
the 
reactions 
of 
the 
mind 
to 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
individual’s 
environment. 
It 
deals 
with 
something 
invisible 
and 
intangible 
that 
cannot 
be 
perceived 
by 
the 
methods 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
But 
the 
natural 
sciences 
must 
admit 
that 
this 
factor 
must 
be 
considered 
as 
real 
also 
from 
their 
point 
of 
view, 
as 
it 
is 
a 
link 
in 
a 
chain 
of 
events 
that 
result 
in 
changes 
in 
the 
sphere 
the 
description 
of 
which 
they 
consider 
as 
the 
specific 
field 
of 
their 
studies. 


In 
analyzing 
and 
demolishing 
the 
claims 
of 
Comte’s 
positivism, 
a 
group 
of 
philosophers 
and 
historians 
known 
as 
the 
südwestdeutsche 
Schule 
elaborated 
the 
category 
of 
understanding 
(Verstehen) 
that 
had 
already 
in 
a 
less 
explicit 
sense 
been 
familiar 
to 
older 
authors. 
This 
specific 
understanding 
of 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
aims 
at 
establishing 
the 
facts 
that 
men 
attach 
a 
definite 
meaning 
to 
the 
state 
of 
their 
environment, 
that 
they 
value 
this 
state 
and, 
motivated 
by 
these 
judgments 
of 
value, 
resort 
to 
definite 
means 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
or 
to 
attain 
a 
definite 
state 
of 
affairs 
different 
from 
that 
which 
would 
prevail 
if 
they 
abstained 
from 
any 
purposeful 
reaction. 
Understanding 
deals 
with 
judgments 
of 
value, 
with 
the 
choice 
of 
ends 
and 
of 
the 
means 
resorted 
to 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
these 
ends, 
and 
with 
the 
valuation 
of 
the 
outcome 
of 
actions 
performed. 


The 
methods 
of 
scientific 
inquiry 
are 
categorially 
not 
different 
from 
the 
procedures 
applied 
by 
everybody 
in 
his 
daily 
mundane 
comportment. 
They 
are 
merely 
more 
refined 
and 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
purified 
of 
inconsistencies 
and 
contradictions. 
Understanding 
is 
not 
a 
method 
of 
procedure 
peculiar 
only 
to 
historians. 
It 
is 
practised 
by 
infants 
as 
soon 
as 
they 
outgrow 
the 
merely 
vegetative 
stage 
of 
their 
first 
days 
and 
weeks. 
There 
is 
no 
conscious 
response 
of 
man 
to 
any 
stimuli 
that 
is 
not 
directed 
by 
understanding. 


Understanding 
presupposes 
and 
implies 
the 
logical 
structure 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
with 
all 
the 
a 
priori 
categories. 
The 
biogenetic 
law 
represents 
the 
ontogeny 
of 
the 
individual 
as 
an 
abbreviated 
recapitulation 
of 
the 
phylogeny 
of 
the 
species. 
In 
an 
analogous 
way 
one 
may 
describe 
changes 
in 
the 
intellectual 
structure. 
The 
child 
recapitulates 
in 
his 
postnatal 
development 
the 
history 
of 
mankind’s 
intellectual 
evolution.10 
The 
suckling 
becomes 
thymologically 
human 
when 
it 
begins 
faintly 
to 
dawn 
in 
his 
mind 
that 
a 
desired 
end 
can 
be 
attained 
by 
a 
definite 
mode 
of 
conduct. 
The 
nonhuman 
animals 
never 
proceed 
beyond 
instinctive 
urges 
and 
conditioned 
reflexes. 



The 
concept 
of 
understanding 
was 
first 
elaborated 
by 
philosophers 
and 
historians 
who 
wanted 
to 
refute 
the 
positivists’ 
disparagement 
of 
the 
methods 
of 
history. 
This 
explains 
why 
it 
was 
originally 
dealt 
with 
only 
as 
the 
mental 
tool 
of 
the 
study 
of 
the 
past. 
But 
the 
services 
understanding 
renders 
to 
man 
in 
throwing 
light 
on 
the 
past 
are 
only 
a 
preliminary 
stage 
in 
the 
endeavors 
to 
anticipate 
what 
may 
happen 
in 
the 
future. 
Seen 
from 
the 
practical 
point 
of 
view, 
man 
appears 
to 
be 
interested 
in 
the 
past 
only 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
provide 
for 
the 
future. 
The 
natural 
sciences 
deal 
with 
experience—which 
necessarily 
is 
always 
the 
record 
of 
what 
happened 
in 
the 
past—because 
the 
categories 
of 
regularity 
and 
causality 
render 
such 
studies 
useful 
for 
the 
guidance 
of 
technological 
action, 
which 
inevitably 
always 
aims 
at 
an 
arrangement 
of 
future 
conditions. 
The 
understanding 
of 
the 
past 
performs 
a 
similar 
service 
in 
making 
action 
as 
successful 
as 
possible. 
Understanding 
aims 
at 
anticipating 
future 
conditions 
as 
far 
as 
they 
depend 
on 
human 
ideas, 
valuations, 
and 
actions. 
There 
is, 
but 
for 
Robinson 
Crusoe 
before 
he 
met 
his 
man 
Friday, 
no 
action 
that 
could 
be 
planned 
or 
executed 
without 
paying 
full 
attention 
to 
what 
the 
actor’s 
fellow 
men 
will 
do. 
Action 
implies 
understanding 
other 
men’s 
reactions. 


The 
anticipation 
of 
events 
in 
the 
sphere 
explored 
by 
the 
natural 
sciences 
is 
based 
upon 
the 
categories 
of 
regularity 
and 
causality. 
There 
are 
in 
some 
byroads 
bridges 
that 
would 
collapse 
if 
a 
truck 
loaded 
with 
ten 
tons 
passed 
over 
them. 
We 
do 
not 
expect 
that 
such 
a 
load 
would 
make 
the 
George 
Washington 
bridge 
tumble. 
We 
firmly 
trust 
in 
the 
categories 
that 
are 
the 
foundations 
of 
our 
physical 
and 
chemical 
knowledge. 


In 
dealing 
with 
the 
reactions 
of 
our 
fellow 
men 
we 
cannot 
rely 
upon 
such 
a 
regularity. 
We 
assume 
that, 
by 
and 
large, 
the 
future 
conduct 
of 
people 
will, 
other 
things 
being 
equal, 
not 
deviate 
without 
special 
reason 
from 
their 
past 
conduct, 
because 
we 
assume 
that 
what 
determined 
their 
past 
conduct 
will 
also 
determine 
their 
future 
conduct. 
However 
different 
we 
may 
know 
ourselves 
to 
be 
from 
other 
people, 
we 
try 
to 
guess 
how 
they 
will 
react 
to 
changes 
in 
their 
environment. 
Out 
of 
what 
we 
know 
about 
a 
man’s 
past 
behavior, 
we 
construct 
a 
scheme 
about 
what 
we 
call 
his 
character. 
We 
assume 
that 
this 
character 
will 
not 
change 
if 
no 
special 
reasons 
interfere, 
and, 
going 
a 
step 
farther, 
we 
even 
try 
to 
foretell 
how 
definite 
changes 
in 
conditions 
will 
affect 
his 
reactions. 
Compared 
with 
the 
seemingly 
absolute 
certainty 
provided 
by 
some 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences, 
these 
assumptions 
and 
all 
the 
conclusions 
derived 
from 
them 
appear 
as 
rather 
shaky; 
the 
positivists 
may 
ridicule 
them 



as 
unscientific. 
Yet 
they 
are 
the 
only 
available 
approach 
to 
the 
problems 
concerned 
and 
indispensable 
for 
any 
action 
to 
be 
accomplished 
in 
a 
social 
environment. 


Understanding 
does 
not 
deal 
with 
the 
praxeological 
side 
of 
human 
action. 
It 
refers 
to 
value 
judgments 
and 
the 
choice 
of 
ends 
and 
of 
means 
on 
the 
part 
of 
our 
fellow 
men. 
It 
refers 
not 
to 
the 
field 
of 
praxeology 
and 
economics, 
but 
to 
the 
field 
of 
history. 
It 
is 
a 
thymological 
category. 
The 
concept 
of 
a 
human 
character 
is 
a 
thymological 
concept. 
Its 
concrete 
content 
in 
each 
instance 
is 
derived 
from 
historical 
experience. 


No 
action 
can 
be 
planned 
and 
executed 
without 
understanding 
of 
the 
future. 
Even 
an 
action 
of 
an 
isolated 
individual 
is 
guided 
by 
definite 
assumptions 
about 
the 
actor’s 
future 
value 
judgments 
and 
is 
so 
far 
determined 
by 
the 
actor’s 
image 
of 
his 
own 
character. 


The 
term 
“speculate” 
was 
originally 
employed 
to 
signify 
any 
kind 
of 
meditation 
and 
forming 
of 
an 
opinion. 
Today 
it 
is 
employed 
with 
an 
opprobrious 
connotation 
to 
disparage 
those 
men 
who, 
in 
the 
capitalistic 
market 
economy, 
excel 
in 
better 
anticipating 
the 
future 
reactions 
of 
their 
fellow 
men 
than 
the 
average 
man 
does. 
The 
rationale 
of 
this 
semantic 
usage 
is 
to 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
inability 
of 
shortsighted 
people 
to 
notice 
the 
uncertainty 
of 
the 
future. 
These 
people 
fail 
to 
realize 
that 
all 
production 
activities 
aim 
at 
satisfying 
the 
most 
urgent 
future 
wants 
and 
that 
today 
no 
certainty 
about 
fuure 
conditions 
is 
available. 
They 
are 
not 
aware 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
is 
a 
qualitative 
problem 
in 
providing 
for 
the 
future. 
In 
all 
the 
writings 
of 
the 
socialist 
authors 
there 
is 
not 
the 
slightest 
allusion 
to 
be 
found 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
one 
of 
the 
main 
problems 
of 
the 
conduct 
of 
production 
activities 
is 
to 
anticipate 
the 
future 
demands 
of 
the 
consumers.11 


Every 
action 
is 
a 
speculation, 
i.e., 
guided 
by 
a 
definite 
opinion 
concerning 
the 
uncertain 
conditions 
of 
the 
future. 
Even 
in 
short-run 
activities 
this 
uncertainty 
prevails. 
Nobody 
can 
know 
whether 
some 
unexpected 
fact 
will 
not 
render 
vain 
all 
that 
he 
has 
provided 
for 
the 
next 
day 
or 
the 
next 
hour. 



3 


Necessity 
and 
Volition 


1. 
The 
Infinite 
Negation, 
the 
notion 
of 
the 
absence 
or 
nonexistence 
of 
something 
or 
of 
the 
denial 
of 
a 
proposition, 
is 
conceivable 
to 
the 
human 
mind. 
But 
the 
notion 
of 
an 
absolute 
negation 
of 
everything, 
the 
representation 
of 
an 
absolute 
nothing, 
is 
beyond 
man’s 
comprehension. 
So 
is 
the 
notion 
of 
the 
emergence 
of 
something 
out 
of 
nothing, 
the 
notion 
of 
an 
absolute 
beginning. 
The 
Lord, 
teaches 
the 
Bible, 
created 
the 
world 
out 
of 
nothing; 
but 
God 
himself 
was 
there 
from 
eternity 
and 
will 
be 
there 
in 
eternity, 
without 
a 
beginning 
and 
without 
an 
end. 


As 
the 
human 
mind 
sees 
it, 
everything 
that 
happens, 
happens 
to 
something 
that 
existed 
before. 
The 
emergence 
of 
something 
new 
is 
seen 
as 
the 
evolution—the 
coming 
to 
maturity—of 
something 
that 
was 
potentially 
already 
present 
in 
what 
existed 
before. 
The 
totality 
of 
the 
universe 
as 
it 
was 
yesterday 
included 
already 
potentially 
the 
totality 
of 
the 
universe 
as 
it 
is 
today. 
The 
universe 
is 
an 
all-comprehensive 
context 
of 
elements, 
a 
continuity 
stretching 
back 
and 
forward 
into 
infinity, 
an 
entity 
to 
which 
to 
ascribe 
either 
an 
origin 
or 
an 
end 
is 
beyond 
the 
mental 
capacity 
of 
man. 


Everything 
that 
is, 
is 
such 
as 
it 
is 
and 
not 
something 
different, 
because 
what 
preceded 
it 
was 
of 
a 
definite 
shape 
and 
structure 
and 
not 
of 
a 
different 
shape 
and 
structure. 


We 
do 
not 
know 
what 
a 
superhuman, 
wholly 
perfect 
mind 
would 
think 
about 
these 
issues. 
We 
are 
merely 
men 
equipped 
with 
a 
human 
mind 
and 
cannot 
even 
imagine 
the 
potency 
and 
capacity 
of 
such 
a 
more 
perfect 
mind, 
essentially 
different 
from 
our 
mental 
powers. 



2. 
The 
Ultimate 
Given 
It 
follows 
that 
scientific 
research 
will 
never 
succeed 
in 
providing 
a 
full 
answer 
to 
what 
is 
called 
the 
riddles 
of 
the 
universe. 
It 
can 
never 
show 
how 
out 
of 
an 
inconceivable 
nothing 
emerged 
all 
that 
is 
and 
how 
one 
day 
all 
that 
exists 
may 
again 
disappear 
and 
the 
“nothing” 
alone 
will 
remain. 


Scientific 
research 
sooner 
or 
later, 
but 
inevitably, 
encounters 
something 
ultimately 
given 
that 
it 
cannot 
trace 
back 
to 
something 
else 
of 
which 
it 
would 
appear 
as 
the 
regular 
or 
necessary 
derivative. 
Scientific 
progress 
consists 
in 
pushing 
further 
back 
this 
ultimately 
given. 
But 
there 
will 
always 
remain 
something 
that—for 
the 
human 
mind 
thirsting 
after 
full 
knowledge—is, 
at 
the 
given 
stage 
of 
the 
history 
of 
science, 
the 
provisional 
stopping 
point. 
It 
was 
only 
the 
rejection 
of 
all 
philosophical 
and 
epistemological 
thinking 
by 
some 
brilliant 
but 
one-sided 
physicists 
of 
the 
last 
decades 
that 
interpreted 
as 
a 
refutation 
of 
determinism 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
were 
at 
a 
loss 
to 
trace 
back 
certain 
phenomena—that 
for 
them 
were 
an 
ultimately 
given—to 
some 
other 
phenomena. 
Perhaps 
it 
is 
true, 
although 
not 
likely, 
that 
contemporary 
physics 
has 
at 
some 
points 
reached 
a 
barrier 
beyond 
which 
no 
further 
expansion 
of 
knowledge 
is 
possible 
for 
man. 
But 
however 
this 
may 
be, 
there 
is 
in 
all 
the 
teachings 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
nothing 
that 
could 
in 
any 
way 
be 
considered 
as 
incompatible 
with 
determinism. 


The 
natural 
sciences 
are 
entirely 
based 
upon 
experience. 
All 
they 
know 
and 
deal 
with 
is 
derived 
from 
experience. 
And 
experience 
could 
not 
teach 
anything 
if 
there 
were 
no 
regularity 
in 
the 
concatenation 
and 
succession 
of 
events. 


But 
the 
philosophy 
of 
positivism 
tries 
to 
assert 
much 
more 
than 
can 
be 
learned 
from 
experience. 
It 
pretends 
to 
know 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
the 
universe 
that 
could 
not 
be 
investigated 
and 
fully 
clarified 
by 
the 
experimental 
methods 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
But 
it 
is 
admitted 
by 
everybody 
that 
up 
to 
now 
these 
methods 
have 
not 
contributed 
anything 
to 
the 
explanation 
of 
the 
phenomena 
of 
life 
as 
distinguished 
from 
physico-chemical 
phenomena. 
And 
all 
the 
desperate 
efforts 
to 
reduce 
thinking 
and 
valuing 
to 
mechanical 
principles 
have 
failed. 


It 
is 
by 
no 
means 
the 
aim 
of 
the 
preceding 
remarks 
to 
express 
any 
opinion 
about 
the 
nature 
and 
structure 
of 
life 
and 
of 
the 
mind. 
This 
essay 
is, 
as 
has 
been 
said 
in 
the 
first 
words 
of 
its 
preface, 
not 
a 
contribution 
to 
philosophy. 
We 
have 
to 
refer 
to 
these 
problems 
only 
in 
order 
to 
show 
that 
the 



treatment 
that 
positivism 
accords 
to 
them 
implies 
a 
theorem 
for 
which 
no 
experimental 
justification 
whatever 
can 
be 
provided, 
viz., 
the 
theorem 
that 
all 
observable 
phenomena 
are 
liable 
to 
a 
reduction 
to 
physical 
and 
chemical 
principles. 
Whence 
do 
the 
positivists 
derive 
this 
theorem? 
It 
would 
be 
certainly 
wrong 
to 
qualify 
it 
as 
an 
a 
priori 
assumption. 
A 
characteristic 
mark 
of 
an 
a 
priori 
category 
is 
that 
any 
different 
assumption 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
topic 
concerned 
appears 
to 
the 
human 
mind 
as 
unthinkable 
and 
self-
contradictory. 
But 
this 
is 
certainly 
not 
the 
case 
with 
the 
positivist 
dogma 
we 
are 
dealing 
with. 
The 
ideas 
taught 
by 
certain 
religious 
and 
metaphysical 
systems 
are 
neither 
unthinkable 
nor 
self-contradictory. 
There 
is 
nothing 
in 
their 
logical 
structure 
that 
would 
force 
any 
reasonable 
man 
to 
reject 
them 
for 
the 
same 
reasons 
he 
would, 
e.g., 
have 
to 
reject 
the 
thesis 
that 
there 
is 
no 
difference 
and 
distinction 
betwen 
A 
and 
non-A. 


The 
gulf 
that 
in 
epistemology 
separates 
the 
events 
in 
the 
field 
investigated 
by 
the 
natural 
sciences 
from 
those 
in 
the 
field 
of 
thinking 
and 
acting 
has 
not 
been 
made 
narrower 
by 
any 
of 
the 
findings 
and 
achievements 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
All 
we 
know 
about 
the 
mutual 
relation 
and 
interdependence 
of 
these 
two 
realms 
of 
reality 
is 
metaphysics. 
The 
positivist 
doctrine 
that 
denies 
the 
legitimacy 
of 
any 
metaphysical 
doctrine 
is 
no 
less 
metaphysical 
than 
many 
other 
doctrines 
at 
variance 
with 
it. 
This 
means: 
What 
a 
man 
in 
the 
present 
state 
of 
mankind’s 
civilization 
and 
knowledge 
says 
about 
such 
issues 
as 
the 
soul, 
the 
mind, 
believing, 
thinking, 
reasoning, 
and 
willing 
does 
not 
have 
the 
epistemological 
character 
of 
natural 
science 
and 
can 
in 
no 
way 
be 
considered 
as 
scientific 
knowledge. 


An 
honest 
man, 
perfectly 
familiar 
with 
all 
the 
achievements 
of 
contemporary 
natural 
science, 
would 
have 
to 
admit 
freely 
and 
unreservedly 
that 
the 
natural 
sciences 
do 
not 
know 
what 
the 
mind 
is 
and 
how 
it 
works 
and 
that 
their 
methods 
of 
research 
are 
not 
fit 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
problems 
dealt 
with 
by 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action. 


It 
would 
have 
been 
wise 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
champions 
of 
logical 
positivism 
to 
take 
to 
heart 
Wittgenstein’s 
advice: 
“Whereof 
one 
cannot 
speak, 
thereof 
one 
must 
be 
silent.”

Statistics 
Statistics 
is 
the 
description 
in 
numerical 
terms 
of 
experiences 
concerning 
phenomena 
not 
subject 
to 
regular 
uniformity. 
As 
far 
as 
there 
is 
discernible 



regularity 
in 
the 
succession 
of 
phenomena, 
no 
recourse 
to 
statistics 
is 
needed. 
The 
objective 
of 
vital 
statistics 
is 
not 
to 
establish 
the 
fact 
that 
all 
men 
are 
mortal, 
but 
to 
give 
information 
about 
the 
length 
of 
human 
life, 
a 
magnitude 
that 
is 
not 
uniform. 
Statistics 
is 
therefore 
a 
specific 
method 
of 
history. 


Where 
there 
is 
regularity, 
statistics 
could 
not 
show 
anything 
else 
than 
that 
A 
is 
followed 
in 
all 
cases 
by 
P 
and 
in 
no 
case 
by 
something 
different 
from 
P. 
If 
statistics 
show 
that 
A 
is 
in 
X% 
of 
all 
cases 
followed 
by 
P 
and 
in 
(100-X)% 
of 
all 
cases 
by 
Q, 
we 
must 
assume 
that 
a 
more 
perfect 
knowledge 
will 
have 
to 
split 
up 
A 
into 
two 
factors 
B 
and 
C 
of 
which 
the 
former 
is 
regularly 
followed 
by 
P 
and 
the 
latter 
by 
Q. 


Statistics 
is 
one 
of 
the 
resources 
of 
historical 
research. 
There 
are 
in 
the 
field 
of 
human 
action 
certain 
occurrences 
and 
events 
characteristic 
features 
of 
which 
can 
be 
described 
in 
numerical 
terms. 
Thus, 
e.g., 
the 
impact 
of 
a 
definite 
doctrine 
upon 
the 
minds 
of 
people 
does 
not 
permit 
of 
any 
numerical 
expression. 
Its 
“quantity” 
can 
be 
ascertained 
only 
by 
the 
method 
of 
the 
specific 
understanding 
of 
the 
historical 
disciplines.2 
But 
the 
number 
of 
people 
who 
lost 
their 
lives 
in 
struggles 
to 
arrange, 
by 
means 
of 
wars, 
revolutions, 
and 
assassinations, 
social 
conditions 
in 
agreement 
with 
a 
definite 
doctrine 
can 
be 
precisely 
determined 
in 
figures 
if 
all 
the 
documentation 
required 
is 
available. 


Statistics 
provides 
numerical 
information 
about 
historical 
facts, 
that 
is, 
about 
events 
that 
happened 
at 
a 
definite 
period 
of 
time 
to 
definite 
people 
in 
a 
definite 
area. 
It 
deals 
with 
the 
past 
and 
not 
with 
the 
future. 
Like 
any 
other 
past 
experience, 
it 
can 
occasionally 
render 
important 
services 
in 
planning 
for 
the 
future, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
say 
anything 
that 
is 
directly 
valid 
for 
the 
future. 


There 
is 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
statistical 
laws. 
People 
resort 
to 
the 
methods 
of 
statistics 
precisely 
where 
they 
are 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
find 
regularity 
in 
the 
concatenation 
and 
succession 
of 
events. 
The 
most 
celebrated 
statistical 
achievement, 
mortality 
tables, 
does 
not 
show 
stability, 
but 
changes 
in 
the 
mortality 
rates 
of 
the 
population. 
The 
average 
length 
of 
human 
life 
changes 
in 
the 
course 
of 
history, 
even 
if 
no 
changes 
were 
to 
emerge 
in 
the 
natural 
environment, 
because 
many 
factors 
that 
affect 
it 
are 
the 
result 
of 
human 
action, 
e.g., 
violence, 
diet, 
medical 
and 
prophylactic 
measures, 
the 
supply 
of 
foodstuffs, 
and 
others. 


The 
concept 
of 
“statistical 
law” 
originated 
when 
some 
authors, 
in 
dealing 
with 
human 
conduct, 
failed 
to 
realize 
why 
certain 
statistical 
data 
change 
only 
slowly 
and, 
in 
blind 
enthusiasm, 
hastily 
identified 
slowness 
of 



change 
with 
absence 
of 
change. 
Thus, 
they 
believed 
themselves 
to 
have 
discovered 
regularities—laws—in 
the 
conduct 
of 
people 
for 
which 
neither 
they 
themselves 
nor 
anybody 
else 
had 
any 
other 
explanation 
than 
the—as 
must 
be 
emphasized, 
baseless—assumption 
that 
statistics 
had 
demonstrated 
them.3 
From 
the 
shaky 
philosophy 
of 
these 
authors 
physicists 
borrowed 
the 
term 
“statistical 
law,” 
but 
they 
gave 
to 
it 
a 
connotation 
that 
differs 
from 
that 
attached 
to 
it 
in 
the 
field 
of 
human 
action. 
It 
is 
not 
our 
task 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
meaning 
these 
physicists 
and 
later 
generations 
of 
physicists 
attached 
to 
this 
term 
or 
with 
the 
services 
statistics 
can 
render 
to 
experimental 
research 
and 
to 
technology. 


The 
orbit 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
is 
the 
field 
in 
which 
the 
human 
mind 
is 
able 
to 
discover 
constant 
relations 
between 
various 
elements. 
What 
characterizes 
the 
field 
of 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
is 
the 
absence 
of 
constant 
relations 
apart 
from 
those 
dealt 
with 
by 
praxeology. 
In 
the 
former 
group 
of 
sciences 
there 
are 
laws 
(of 
nature) 
and 
measurement. 
In 
the 
latter 
there 
is 
no 
measurement 
and—apart 
from 
praxeology—no 
laws; 
there 
is 
only 
history, 
including 
statistics. 


4. 
Free 
Will 
Man 
is 
not, 
like 
the 
animals, 
an 
obsequious 
puppet 
of 
instincts 
and 
sensual 
impulses. 
Man 
has 
the 
power 
to 
suppress 
instinctive 
desires, 
he 
has 
a 
will 
of 
his 
own, 
he 
chooses 
between 
incompatible 
ends. 
In 
this 
sense 
he 
is 
a 
moral 
person; 
in 
this 
sense 
he 
is 
free. 


However, 
it 
is 
not 
permissible 
to 
interpret 
this 
freedom 
as 
independence 
of 
the 
universe 
and 
its 
laws. 
Man 
too 
is 
an 
element 
of 
the 
universe, 
descended 
from 
the 
original 
X 
out 
of 
which 
everything 
developed. 
He 
has 
inherited 
from 
the 
infinite 
line 
of 
his 
progenitors 
the 
physiological 
equipment 
of 
his 
self; 
in 
his 
postnatal 
life 
he 
was 
exposed 
to 
a 
variety 
of 
physical 
and 
mental 
experiences. 
He 
is 
at 
any 
instant 
of 
his 
life—his 
earthly 
pilgrimage—a 
product 
of 
the 
whole 
history 
of 
the 
universe. 
All 
his 
actions 
are 
the 
inevitable 
result 
of 
his 
individuality 
as 
shaped 
by 
all 
that 
preceded. 
An 
omniscient 
being 
may 
have 
correctly 
anticipated 
each 
of 
his 
choices. 
(However, 
we 
do 
not 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
intricate 
theological 
problems 
that 
the 
concept 
of 
omniscience 
raises.) 


Freedom 
of 
the 
will 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
the 
decisions 
that 
guide 
a 
man’s 
action 
fall, 
as 
it 
were, 
from 
outside 
into 
the 
fabric 
of 
the 
universe 
and 
add 
to 
it 



something 
that 
had 
no 
relation 
to 
and 
was 
independent 
of 
the 
elements 
which 
had 
formed 
the 
universe 
before. 
Actions 
are 
directed 
by 
ideas, 
and 
ideas 
are 
products 
of 
the 
human 
mind, 
which 
is 
definitely 
a 
part 
of 
the 
universe 
and 
of 
which 
the 
power 
is 
strictly 
determined 
by 
the 
whole 
structure 
of 
the 
universe. 


What 
the 
term 
“freedom 
of 
the 
will” 
refers 
to 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
ideas 
that 
induce 
a 
man 
to 
make 
a 
decision 
(a 
choice) 
are, 
like 
all 
other 
ideas, 
not 
“produced” 
by 
external 
“facts,” 
do 
not 
“mirror” 
the 
conditions 
of 
reality, 
and 
are 
not 
“uniquely 
determined” 
by 
any 
ascertainable 
external 
factor 
to 
which 
we 
could 
impute 
them 
in 
the 
way 
in 
which 
we 
impute 
in 
all 
other 
occurrences 
an 
effect 
to 
a 
definite 
cause. 
There 
is 
nothing 
else 
that 
could 
be 
said 
about 
a 
definite 
instance 
of 
a 
man’s 
acting 
and 
choosing 
than 
to 
ascribe 
it 
to 
this 
man’s 
individuality. 


We 
do 
not 
know 
how 
out 
of 
the 
encounter 
of 
a 
human 
individuality, 
i.e., 
a 
man 
as 
he 
has 
been 
formed 
by 
all 
he 
has 
inherited 
and 
by 
all 
he 
has 
experienced, 
and 
a 
new 
experience 
definite 
ideas 
result 
and 
determine 
the 
individual’s 
conduct. 
We 
do 
not 
even 
have 
any 
surmise 
how 
such 
knowledge 
could 
be 
acquired. 
More 
than 
that, 
we 
realize 
that 
if 
such 
knowledge 
were 
attainable 
for 
men, 
and 
if, 
consequently, 
the 
formation 
of 
ideas 
and 
thereby 
the 
will 
could 
be 
manipulated 
in 
the 
way 
machines 
are 
operated 
by 
the 
engineer, 
human 
conditions 
would 
be 
essentially 
altered. 
There 
would 
yawn 
a 
wide 
gulf 
between 
those 
who 
manipulate 
other 
people’s 
ideas 
and 
will 
and 
those 
whose 
ideas 
and 
will 
are 
manipulated 
by 
others. 


It 
is 
precisely 
the 
lack 
of 
such 
knowledge 
that 
generates 
the 
fundamental 
difference 
between 
the 
natural 
sciences 
and 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action. 


In 
referring 
to 
the 
free 
will 
we 
are 
pointing 
out 
that 
in 
the 
production 
of 
events 
something 
can 
be 
instrumental 
about 
which 
the 
natural 
sciences 
cannot 
convey 
any 
information, 
something 
that 
the 
natural 
sciences 
cannot 
even 
notice. 
Yet 
our 
impotence 
to 
ascertain 
an 
absolute 
beginning 
out 
of 
nothing 
forces 
us 
to 
assume 
that 
also 
this 
invisible 
and 
intangible 
something 
—the 
human 
mind—is 
an 
inherent 
part 
of 
the 
universe, 
a 
product 
of 
its 
whole 
history.4 


The 
traditional 
treatment 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
free 
will 
refers 
to 
the 
actor’s 
vacillation 
before 
the 
final 
resolution. 
At 
this 
stage 
the 
actor 
wavers 
between 
different 
courses 
of 
action 
each 
of 
which 
seems 
to 
have 
some 
merits 
and 
demerits 
that 
the 
others 
lack. 
In 
comparing 
their 
pros 
and 
cons 
he 
is 
intent 
upon 
finding 
the 
decision 
that 
conforms 
to 
his 
personality 
and 
to 
the 
specific 
conditions 
of 
the 
instant 
as 
he 
sees 
them 
and 
thus 
upon 
satisfying 
best 
all 
his 



concerns. 
This 
means 
that 
his 
individuality—the 
product 
of 
all 
that 
he 
has 
inherited 
at 
birth 
from 
his 
ancestors 
and 
of 
all 
that 
he 
himself 
has 
experienced 
up 
to 
the 
critical 
moment—determines 
the 
final 
resolution. 
If 
later 
he 
reviews 
his 
past, 
he 
is 
aware 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
his 
comportment 
in 
any 
situation 
was 
fully 
determined 
by 
the 
kind 
of 
man 
he 
was 
at 
the 
instant 
of 
the 
action. 
It 
is 
immaterial 
whether 
in 
retrospect 
he 
himself 
or 
an 
unaffected 
observer 
can 
clearly 
describe 
all 
the 
factors 
that 
were 
instrumental 
in 
forming 
the 
past 
decision. 


Nobody 
is 
in 
a 
position 
to 
predict 
with 
the 
same 
assurance 
with 
which 
the 
natural 
sciences 
make 
predictions 
how 
he 
himself 
and 
other 
people 
will 
act 
in 
the 
future. 
There 
is 
no 
method 
that 
would 
enable 
us 
to 
learn 
about 
a 
human 
personality 
all 
that 
would 
be 
needed 
to 
make 
such 
prognostications 
with 
the 
degree 
of 
certainty 
technology 
attains 
in 
its 
predictions. 


The 
way 
in 
which 
historians 
and 
biographers 
proceed 
in 
analyzing 
and 
explaining 
the 
actions 
of 
the 
men 
with 
whom 
they 
are 
dealing 
reflects 
a 
more 
correct 
view 
of 
the 
problems 
involved 
than 
voluminous 
sophisticated 
treatises 
of 
moral 
philosophy. 
The 
historian 
refers 
to 
the 
spiritual 
milieu 
and 
the 
past 
experiences 
of 
the 
actor, 
to 
his 
knowledge 
or 
ignorance 
of 
all 
the 
data 
that 
could 
influence 
his 
decision, 
to 
his 
state 
of 
health, 
and 
to 
many 
other 
factors 
that 
could 
have 
played 
a 
role. 
But 
then, 
even 
after 
full 
attention 
has 
been 
paid 
to 
all 
these 
matters, 
something 
remains 
that 
defies 
any 
attempts 
at 
further 
interpretation, 
viz., 
the 
personality 
or 
individuality 
of 
the 
actor. 
When 
all 
is 
said 
about 
the 
case, 
there 
is 
finally 
no 
other 
answer 
to 
the 
question 
why 
Caesar 
crossed 
the 
Rubicon 
than: 
because 
he 
was 
Caesar. 
We 
cannot 
eliminate 
in 
dealing 
with 
human 
action 
reference 
to 
the 
actor’s 
personality. 


Men 
are 
unequal; 
individuals 
differ 
from 
one 
another. 
They 
differ 
because 
their 
prenatal 
as 
well 
as 
their 
postnatal 
history 
is 
never 
identical. 


5. 
Inevitability 
All 
that 
happens 
was, 
under 
the 
prevailing 
conditions, 
bound 
to 
happen. 
It 
happened 
because 
the 
forces 
operating 
on 
its 
production 
were 
more 
powerful 
than 
the 
counteracting 
forces. 
Its 
happening 
was, 
in 
this 
sense, 
inevitable. 


Yet 
the 
historian 
who 
in 
retrospect 
speaks 
of 
inevitability 
is 
not 
indulging 
in 
a 
pleonasm. 
What 
he 
means 
is 
to 
qualify 
a 
definite 
event 
or 
array 
of 
events 
A 
as 
the 
moving 
force 
producing 
a 
second 
event 
B; 
the 
proviso: 



provided 
no 
sufficiently 
powerful 
counteracting 
factor 
appeared, 
is 
self-
understood. 
If 
such 
a 
counterpoise 
was 
lacking, 
A 
was 
bound 
to 
result 
in 
B, 
and 
it 
is 
permissible 
to 
call 
the 
outcome 
B 
inevitable. 


In 
forecasting 
future 
events, 
apart 
from 
the 
field 
covered 
by 
praxeological 
law, 
reference 
to 
inevitability 
is 
a 
meaningless 
flower 
of 
speech. 
It 
does 
not 
add 
anything 
to 
the 
conclusive 
force 
of 
a 
prediction. 
It 
merely 
attests 
the 
infatuation 
of 
its 
author. 
This 
is 
all 
that 
needs 
to 
be 
said 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
prophetic 
effusions 
of 
the 
various 
systems 
of 
philosophy 
of 
history.5 
The 
“inexorability 
of 
a 
law 
of 
nature” 
(Notwendigkeit 
eines 
Naturprozesses) 
which 
Marx 
claimed 
for 
his 
prophecy6 
is 
just 
a 
rhetorical 
trick. 


The 
momentous 
changes 
occurring 
in 
the 
course 
of 
cosmic 
and 
human 
history 
are 
the 
composite 
effect 
of 
a 
multitude 
of 
events. 
Each 
of 
these 
contributing 
events 
is 
strictly 
determined 
by 
the 
factors 
that 
preceded 
and 
produced 
it 
and 
so 
is 
the 
part 
each 
of 
them 
plays 
in 
the 
production 
of 
the 
momentous 
change. 
But 
if 
and 
as 
far 
as 
the 
chains 
of 
causation 
upon 
which 
the 
occurrence 
of 
these 
various 
contributing 
events 
depends 
are 
independent 
of 
one 
another, 
a 
situation 
may 
result 
that 
has 
induced 
some 
historians 
and 
philosophers 
to 
exaggerate 
the 
role 
chance 
plays 
in 
the 
history 
of 
mankind. 
They 
fail 
to 
realize 
that 
events 
are 
to 
be 
graded 
according 
to 
their 
size 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
weight 
of 
their 
effects 
and 
of 
their 
cooperation 
in 
the 
production 
of 
the 
composite 
effect. 
If 
only 
one 
of 
the 
minor 
events 
is 
altered, 
the 
influence 
upon 
the 
total 
outcome 
will 
also 
only 
be 
small. 


It 
is 
a 
rather 
unsatisfactory 
way 
to 
argue: 
If 
the 
police 
in 
Sarajevo 
had 
been 
more 
efficient 
on 
June 
28, 
1914, 
the 
archduke 
would 
not 
have 
been 
murdered 
and 
the 
World 
War 
and 
all 
its 
disastrous 
consequences 
would 
have 
been 
avoided. 
What 
made—in 
the 
sense 
referred 
to 
above—the 
great 
war 
inevitable 
was 
the 
irreconcilable 
conflicts 
among 
the 
various 
linguistic 
groups 
(nationalities) 
of 
the 
Habsburg 
Monarchy, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
German 
endeavors 
to 
build 
a 
navy 
strong 
enough 
to 
defeat 
the 
British 
naval 
forces. 
The 
Russian 
revolution 
was 
bound 
to 
come, 
as 
the 
Tsarist 
system 
and 
its 
bureaucratic 
methods 
were 
passionately 
rejected 
by 
the 
immense 
majority 
of 
the 
population; 
the 
outbreak 
of 
the 
war 
did 
not 
accelerate 
its 
coming; 
it 
rather 
delayed 
it 
for 
a 
short 
time. 
The 
fiery 
nationalism 
and 
etatism 
of 
the 
European 
peoples 
could 
not 
but 
result 
in 
war. 
These 
were 
the 
factors 
that 
made 
the 
great 
war 
and 
its 
consequences 
inevitable, 
no 
matter 
whether 
the 
Serbian 
nationalists 
succeeded 
or 
failed 
in 



their 
attempts 
to 
murder 
the 
heir 
to 
the 
Austrian 
throne. 


Political, 
social, 
and 
economic 
affairs 
are 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
cooperation 
of 
all 
people. 
Although 
there 
prevail 
considerable 
differences 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
various 
individuals’ 
contributions, 
they 
are 
commensurable 
and 
by 
and 
large 
capable 
of 
being 
replaced 
by 
those 
of 
other 
individuals. 
An 
accident 
that 
eliminates 
the 
work 
of 
an 
individual, 
be 
he 
even 
a 
rather 
eminent 
one, 
diverts 
the 
course 
of 
events 
only 
slightly 
from 
the 
line 
they 
would 
have 
followed 
if 
it 
had 
not 
occurred. 


Conditions 
are 
different 
in 
the 
field 
of 
the 
greatest 
intellectual 
and 
artistic 
performances. 
The 
feat 
of 
the 
genius 
is 
outside 
the 
regular 
flow 
of 
human 
affairs. 
The 
genius 
too 
is 
in 
many 
regards 
determined 
by 
the 
conditions 
of 
his 
environment. 
But 
what 
gives 
to 
his 
work 
its 
specific 
lustre 
is 
something 
that 
is 
unique 
and 
cannot 
be 
duplicated 
by 
anyone 
else. 
We 
know 
neither 
what 
combination 
of 
genes 
produces 
the 
innate 
potentialities 
of 
the 
genius 
nor 
what 
kind 
of 
environmental 
conditions 
are 
needed 
to 
bring 
them 
to 
fruition. 
If 
he 
succeeds 
in 
avoiding 
all 
the 
dangers 
that 
could 
harm 
him 
and 
his 
accomplishments, 
the 
better 
for 
mankind. 
If 
an 
accident 
annihilates 
him, 
all 
the 
people 
lose 
something 
irreplaceable. 


If 
Dante, 
Shakespeare, 
or 
Beethoven 
had 
died 
in 
childhood, 
mankind 
would 
miss 
what 
it 
owes 
to 
them. 
In 
this 
sense 
we 
may 
say 
that 
chance 
plays 
a 
role 
in 
human 
affairs. 
But 
to 
stress 
this 
fact 
does 
not 
in 
the 
least 
contradict 
the 
a 
priori 
category 
of 
determinism. 



4 


Certainty 
and 
Uncertainty 


1. 
The 
Problem 
of 
Quantitative 
Definiteness 
Laboratory 
experiments 
and 
observation 
of 
external 
phenomena 
enable 
the 
natural 
sciences 
to 
proceed 
with 
measurement 
and 
the 
quantification 
of 
knowledge. 
Referring 
to 
this 
fact, 
one 
used 
to 
style 
these 
sciences 
as 
the 
exact 
sciences 
and 
to 
belittle 
the 
lack 
of 
exactitude 
in 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action. 


Today 
nobody 
any 
longer 
denies 
that 
on 
account 
of 
the 
insufficiency 
of 
our 
senses 
measurement 
is 
never 
perfect 
and 
precise 
in 
the 
full 
sense 
of 
these 
terms. 
It 
is 
only 
more 
or 
less 
approximate. 
Besides, 
the 
Heisenberg 
principle 
shows 
that 
there 
are 
relations 
that 
man 
cannot 
measure 
at 
all. 
There 
is 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
quantitative 
exactitude 
in 
our 
description 
of 
natural 
phenomena. 
However, 
the 
approximations 
that 
measurement 
of 
physical 
and 
chemical 
objects 
can 
provide 
are 
by 
and 
large 
sufficient 
for 
practical 
purposes. 
The 
orbit 
of 
technology 
is 
an 
orbit 
of 
approximate 
measurement 
and 
approximate 
quantitative 
definiteness. 


In 
the 
sphere 
of 
human 
action 
there 
are 
no 
constant 
relations 
between 
any 
factors. 
There 
is 
consequently 
no 
measurement 
and 
no 
quantification 
possible. 
All 
measurable 
magnitudes 
that 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
encounter 
are 
quantities 
of 
the 
environment 
in 
which 
man 
lives 
and 
acts. 
They 
are 
historical 
facts, 
e.g., 
facts 
of 
economic 
or 
of 
military 
history, 
and 
are 
to 
be 
clearly 
distinguished 
from 
the 
problems 
with 
which 
the 
theoretical 
science 
of 
action—praxeology 
and 
especially 
also 
its 
most 
developed 
part, 
economics—deals. 


Deluded 
by 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
must 
ape 
the 
technique 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences, 
hosts 
of 
authors 
are 
intent 
upon 
a 



quantification 
of 
economics. 
They 
think 
that 
economics 
ought 
to 
imitate 
chemistry, 
which 
progressed 
from 
a 
qualitative 
to 
a 
quantitative 
state.1 
Their 
motto 
is 
the 
positivistic 
maxim: 
Science 
is 
measurement. 
Supported 
by 
rich 
funds, 
they 
are 
busy 
reprinting 
and 
rearranging 
statistical 
data 
provided 
by 
governments, 
by 
trade 
associations, 
and 
by 
corporations 
and 
other 
enterprises. 
They 
try 
to 
compute 
the 
arithmetical 
relations 
among 
various 
of 
these 
data 
and 
thus 
to 
determine 
what 
they 
call, 
by 
analogy 
with 
the 
natural 
sciences, 
correlations 
and 
functions. 
They 
fail 
to 
realize 
that 
in 
the 
field 
of 
human 
action 
statistics 
is 
always 
history 
and 
that 
the 
alleged 
“correlations” 
and 
“functions” 
do 
not 
describe 
anything 
else 
than 
what 
happened 
at 
a 
definite 
instant 
of 
time 
in 
a 
definite 
geographical 
area 
as 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
actions 
of 
a 
definite 
number 
of 
people.2 
As 
a 
method 
of 
economic 
analysis 
econometrics 
is 
a 
childish 
play 
with 
figures 
that 
does 
not 
contribute 
anything 
to 
the 
elucidation 
of 
the 
problems 
of 
economic 
reality. 


2. 
Certain 
Knowledge 
Radical 
empiricism 
rejects 
the 
idea 
that 
certain 
knowledge 
concerning 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
universe 
is 
accessible 
to 
the 
minds 
of 
mortal 
men. 
It 
considers 
the 
a 
priori 
categories 
of 
logic 
and 
mathematics 
as 
assumptions 
or 
conventions, 
freely 
chosen 
on 
account 
of 
their 
convenience 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
kind 
of 
knowledge 
that 
man 
is 
able 
to 
acquire. 
All 
that 
is 
inferred 
by 
deduction 
from 
these 
a 
priori 
categories 
is 
merely 
tautological 
and 
does 
not 
convey 
any 
information 
about 
the 
state 
of 
reality. 
Even 
if 
we 
were 
to 
accept 
the 
untenable 
dogma 
of 
regularity 
in 
the 
concatenation 
and 
succession 
of 
natural 
events, 
the 
fallibility 
and 
insufficiency 
of 
the 
human 
senses 
makes 
it 
impossible 
to 
ascribe 
certainty 
to 
any 
a 
posteriori 
knowledge. 
We, 
human 
beings 
as 
we 
are, 
must 
acquiesce 
in 
this 
state 
of 
affairs. 
How 
things 
“really” 
are 
or 
may 
appear 
when 
looked 
upon 
from 
the 
vista 
of 
a 
superhuman 
intelligence, 
essentially 
different 
from 
the 
human 
mind 
as 
it 
works 
in 
the 
present 
aeon 
of 
cosmic 
history, 
is 
for 
us 
inscrutable. 


However, 
this 
radical 
scepticism 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
praxeological 
knowledge. 
Praxeology 
too 
starts 
from 
an 
a 
priori 
category 
and 
proceeds 
by 
deductive 
reasoning. 
Yet 
the 
objections 
raised 
by 
scepticism 
against 
the 
conclusiveness 
of 
a 
priori 
categories 
and 
a 
priori 
reasoning 
do 
not 
apply 
to 
it. 
For, 
as 
must 
be 
emphasized 
again, 
the 
reality 
the 
elucidation 
and 
interpretation 
of 
which 
is 
the 
task 
of 
praxeology 
is 
congeneric 
with 
the 



logical 
structure 
of 
the 
human 
mind. 
The 
human 
mind 
generates 
both 
human 
thinking 
and 
human 
action. 
Human 
action 
and 
human 
thinking 
stem 
from 
the 
same 
source 
and 
are 
in 
this 
sense 
homogeneous. 
There 
is 
nothing 
in 
the 
structure 
of 
action 
that 
the 
human 
mind 
cannot 
fully 
explain. 
In 
this 
sense 
praxeology 
supplies 
certain 
knowledge. 


Man 
as 
he 
exists 
on 
this 
planet 
in 
the 
present 
period 
of 
cosmic 
history 
may 
one 
day 
disappear. 
But 
as 
long 
as 
there 
are 
beings 
of 
the 
species 
Homo 
sapiens 
there 
will 
be 
human 
action 
of 
the 
categorial 
kind 
praxeology 
deals 
with. 
In 
this 
restricted 
sense 
praxeology 
provides 
exact 
knowledge 
of 
future 
conditions. 


In 
the 
field 
of 
human 
action 
all 
quantitatively 
determined 
magnitudes 
refer 
only 
to 
history 
and 
do 
not 
convey 
any 
knowledge 
that 
would 
mean 
something 
beyond 
the 
specific 
historical 
constellation 
that 
generated 
them. 
All 
general 
knowledge, 
that 
is, 
all 
knowledge 
that 
is 
applicable 
not 
only 
to 
a 
definite 
constellation 
of 
the 
past 
but 
to 
all 
praxeologically 
identical 
constellations 
of 
the 
past 
as 
well 
as 
of 
the 
future, 
is 
deductive 
knowledge 
ultimately 
derived 
from 
the 
a 
priori 
category 
of 
action. 
It 
refers 
rigidly 
to 
any 
reality 
of 
action 
as 
it 
appeared 
in 
the 
past 
and 
will 
appear 
in 
the 
future. 
It 
conveys 
precise 
knowledge 
of 
real 
things. 


3. 
The 
Uncertainty 
of 
the 
Future 
According 
to 
an 
often 
quoted 
dictum 
of 
Auguste 
Comte, 
the 
objective 
of 
the—natural—sciences 
is 
to 
know 
in 
order 
to 
predict 
what 
will 
happen 
in 
the 
future. 
These 
predictions 
are, 
as 
far 
as 
they 
refer 
to 
the 
effects 
of 
human 
action, 
conditional. 
They 
say: 
If 
A, 
then 
B. 
But 
they 
do 
not 
tell 
anything 
about 
the 
emergence 
of 
A. 
If 
a 
man 
absorbs 
potassium 
cyanide, 
he 
will 
die. 
But 
whether 
he 
will 
swallow 
this 
poison 
or 
not 
is 
left 
undecided. 


The 
predictions 
of 
praxeology 
are, 
within 
the 
range 
of 
their 
applicability, 
absolutely 
certain. 
But 
they 
do 
not 
tell 
us 
anything 
about 
the 
value 
judgments 
of 
the 
acting 
individuals 
and 
the 
way 
they 
will 
determine 
their 
actions. 
All 
we 
can 
know 
about 
these 
value 
judgments 
has 
the 
categorial 
character 
of 
the 
specific 
understanding 
of 
the 
historical 
sciences 
of 
human 
action. 
Whether 
our 
anticipations 
of—our 
own 
or 
other 
peoples’—future 
value 
judgments 
and 
of 
the 
means 
that 
will 
be 
resorted 
to 
for 
adjusting 
action 
to 
these 
value 
judgments 
will 
be 
correct 
or 
not 
cannot 
be 
known 
in 
advance. 


This 
uncertainty 
of 
the 
future 
is 
one 
of 
the 
main 
marks 
of 
the 
human 



condition. 
It 
taints 
all 
manifestations 
of 
life 
and 
action. 


Man 
is 
at 
the 
mercy 
of 
forces 
and 
powers 
beyond 
his 
control. 
He 
acts 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
as 
much 
as 
possible 
what, 
as 
he 
thinks, 
will 
harm 
himself. 
But 
he 
can 
at 
best 
succeed 
only 
within 
a 
narrow 
margin. 
And 
he 
can 
never 
know 
beforehand 
to 
what 
extent 
his 
acting 
will 
attain 
the 
end 
sought 
and, 
if 
it 
attains 
it, 
whether 
this 
action 
will 
in 
retrospect 
appear—to 
himself 
or 
to 
the 
other 
people 
looking 
upon 
it—as 
the 
best 
choice 
among 
those 
that 
were 
open 
to 
him 
at 
the 
instant 
he 
embarked 
upon 
it. 


Technology 
based 
on 
the 
achievements 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
aims 
at 
full 
control 
within 
a 
definite 
sphere, 
which, 
of 
course, 
comprehends 
only 
a 
fraction 
of 
the 
events 
that 
determine 
man’s 
fate. 
Although 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
tends 
to 
enlarge 
the 
sphere 
of 
such 
scientifically 
directed 
action, 
it 
will 
never 
cover 
more 
than 
a 
narrow 
margin 
of 
possible 
events. 
And 
even 
within 
this 
margin 
there 
can 
never 
be 
absolute 
certainty. 
The 
result 
aimed 
at 
can 
be 
thwarted 
by 
the 
invasion 
of 
forces 
not 
yet 
sufficiently 
known 
or 
beyond 
human 
control. 
Technological 
engineering 
does 
not 
eliminate 
the 
aleatory 
element 
of 
human 
existence; 
it 
merely 
restricts 
its 
field 
a 
little. 
There 
always 
remains 
an 
orbit 
that 
to 
the 
limited 
knowledge 
of 
man 
appears 
as 
an 
orbit 
of 
pure 
chance 
and 
marks 
life 
as 
a 
gamble. 
Man 
and 
his 
works 
are 
always 
exposed 
to 
the 
impact 
of 
unforeseen 
and 
uncontrollable 
events. 
He 
cannot 
help 
banking 
upon 
the 
good 
luck 
not 
to 
be 
hit 
by 
them. 
Even 
dull 
people 
cannot 
fail 
to 
realize 
that 
their 
well-being 
ultimately 
depends 
on 
the 
operation 
of 
forces 
beyond 
man’s 
wisdom, 
knowledge, 
prevision, 
and 
provision. 
With 
regard 
to 
these 
forces 
all 
human 
planning 
is 
vain. 
This 
is 
what 
religion 
has 
in 
mind 
when 
it 
refers 
to 
the 
unfathomable 
decrees 
of 
Heaven 
and 
turns 
to 
prayer. 


4. 
Quantification 
and 
Understanding 
in 
Acting 
and 
in 
History 
Many 
data 
with 
which 
the 
mind 
is 
concerned 
either 
in 
retrospect 
or 
in 
planning 
for 
the 
future 
can 
be 
expressed 
in 
numerical 
terms. 
Other 
relevant 
magnitudes 
can 
only 
be 
put 
into 
words 
of 
a 
nonmathematical 
language. 
In 
regard 
to 
such 
magnitudes 
the 
specific 
understanding 
of 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
is 
a 
substitute, 
as 
it 
were, 
for 
the 
unfeasibility 
of 
measurement. 


In 
this 
sense 
the 
historian 
as 
well 
as 
the 
acting 
man 
speaks 
of 
the 
relevance 
of 
different 
events 
and 
actions 
in 
regard 
to 
their 
production 
of 
other 
events 
and 
of 
definite 
states 
of 
affairs. 
In 
this 
sense 
they 
distinguish 
between 



more 
important 
and 
less 
important 
events 
and 
facts 
and 
between 
greater 
men 
and 
lesser 
men. 


Misjudgments 
in 
this 
quasi-quantitative 
evaluation 
of 
reality 
are 
pernicious 
if 
they 
occur 
in 
planning 
actions. 
Speculations 
are 
bound 
to 
fail 
if 
based 
upon 
an 
illusory 
anticipation 
of 
future 
conditions. 
Even 
if 
they 
are 
“qualitatively” 
correct, 
i.e., 
if 
the 
conditions 
they 
have 
anticipated 
really 
appear, 
they 
may 
bring 
disaster 
if 
they 
are 
“quantitatively” 
wrong, 
i.e., 
if 
they 
have 
erred 
concerning 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
effects 
or 
concerning 
the 
timing 
of 
their 
appearance. 
It 
is 
this 
that 
makes 
the 
long-range 
speculations 
of 
statesmen 
and 
of 
businessmen 
especially 
hazardous. 


5. 
The 
Precariousness 
of 
Forecasting 
in 
Human 
Affairs 
In 
forecasting 
what 
may 
or 
will 
happen 
in 
the 
future, 
man 
can 
either 
be 
right 
or 
mistaken. 
But 
his 
anticipation 
of 
future 
events 
cannot 
influence 
the 
course 
of 
nature. 
Whatever 
man 
may 
expect, 
nature 
will 
go 
its 
own 
way 
unaffected 
by 
any 
human 
expectations, 
desires, 
wishes, 
and 
hopes. 


It 
is 
different 
in 
the 
sphere 
in 
which 
human 
action 
can 
operate. 
Forecasting 
may 
prove 
mistaken 
if 
it 
induces 
men 
to 
proceed 
successfully 
in 
a 
way 
that 
is 
designed 
to 
avoid 
the 
happening 
of 
the 
forecast 
events. 
What 
impels 
people 
to 
listen 
to 
the 
opinions 
of 
soothsayers 
or 
to 
consult 
with 
them 
is 
frequently 
the 
desire 
to 
avoid 
the 
emergence 
of 
undesirable 
events 
that, 
according 
to 
these 
prophecies, 
the 
future 
has 
in 
store 
for 
them. 
If, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
what 
the 
oracle 
promised 
them 
agreed 
with 
their 
wishes, 
they 
could 
react 
to 
the 
prophecy 
in 
two 
ways. 
Trusting 
to 
the 
oracle, 
they 
could 
either 
become 
indolent 
and 
neglect 
doing 
what 
had 
to 
be 
done 
in 
order 
to 
bring 
about 
the 
end 
forecast. 
Or 
they 
could, 
full 
of 
confidence, 
double 
their 
effort 
to 
attain 
the 
goal 
desired. 
In 
all 
such 
cases 
the 
content 
of 
the 
prophecy 
had 
the 
power 
to 
divert 
the 
course 
of 
affairs 
from 
the 
lines 
that 
it 
would 
have 
pursued 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
an 
allegedly 
authoritative 
forecast. 


We 
may 
illustrate 
the 
issue 
by 
referring 
to 
business 
forecasting. 
If 
people 
are 
told 
in 
May 
that 
the 
boom 
going 
on 
will 
continue 
for 
several 
months 
and 
will 
not 
end 
in 
a 
crash 
before 
December, 
they 
will 
try 
to 
sell 
as 
soon 
as 
possible, 
at 
any 
rate 
before 
December. 
Then 
the 
boom 
will 
come 
to 
an 
end 
before 
the 
day 
indicated 
by 
the 
prediction. 


6. 
Economic 
Prediction 
and 
the 
Trend 
Doctrine 

Economics 
can 
predict 
the 
effects 
to 
be 
expected 
from 
resorting 
to 
definite 
measures 
of 
economic 
policies. 
It 
can 
answer 
the 
question 
whether 
a 
definite 
policy 
is 
able 
to 
attain 
the 
ends 
aimed 
at 
and, 
if 
the 
answer 
is 
in 
the 
negative, 
what 
its 
real 
effects 
will 
be. 
But, 
of 
course, 
this 
prediction 
can 
be 
only 
“qualitative.” 
It 
cannot 
be 
“quantitative” 
as 
there 
are 
no 
constant 
relations 
between 
the 
factors 
and 
effects 
concerned. 
The 
practical 
value 
of 
economics 
is 
to 
be 
seen 
in 
this 
neatly 
circumscribed 
power 
of 
predicting 
the 
outcome 
of 
definite 
measures. 


Those 
rejecting 
the 
aprioristic 
science 
of 
economics 
on 
account 
of 
its 
apriorism, 
the 
adepts 
of 
the 
various 
schools 
of 
Historicism 
and 
Institutionalism, 
ought 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
their 
own 
epistemological 
principles 
to 
be 
prevented 
from 
expressing 
any 
judgment 
about 
the 
future 
effects 
to 
be 
expected 
from 
any 
definite 
policy. 
They 
cannot 
even 
know 
what 
a 
definite 
measure, 
whenever 
resorted 
to, 
brought 
about 
in 
the 
past. 
For 
what 
happened 
was 
always 
the 
result 
of 
the 
joint 
operation 
of 
a 
multitude 
of 
factors. 
The 
measure 
in 
question 
was 
only 
one 
of 
many 
factors 
contributing 
to 
the 
emergence 
of 
the 
final 
outcome. 
But 
even 
if 
these 
scholars 
are 
bold 
enough 
to 
assert 
that 
a 
definite 
measure 
in 
the 
past 
resulted 
in 
a 
definite 
effect, 
they 
would 
not—from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
their 
own 
principles—be 
justified 
in 
assuming 
that 
therefore 
the 
same 
effect 
will 
be 
attained 
in 
the 
future 
too. 
Consistent 
Historicism 
and 
Institutionalism 
would 
have 
to 
refrain 
from 
issuing 
any 
opinion 
about 
the—necessarily 
future—effects 
of 
any 
measure 
or 
policy. 
They 
would 
have 
to 
restrict 
their 
teachings 
to 
the 
treatment 
of 
economic 
history. 
(We 
may 
pass 
over 
the 
question 
how 
economic 
history 
could 
be 
dealt 
with 
without 
economic 
theory.) 


However, 
the 
public’s 
interest 
in 
the 
studies 
labeled 
as 
economic 
is 
entirely 
due 
to 
the 
expectation 
that 
one 
can 
learn 
something 
about 
the 
methods 
to 
be 
resorted 
to 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
definite 
ends. 
The 
students 
attending 
the 
courses 
of 
the 
professors 
of 
“economics” 
as 
well 
as 
the 
governments 
appointing 
“economic” 
advisers 
are 
anxious 
to 
get 
information 
about 
the 
future, 
not 
about 
the 
past. 
But 
all 
that 
these 
experts 
can 
tell 
them, 
if 
they 
remain 
faithful 
to 
their 
own 
epistemological 
principles, 
refers 
to 
the 
past. 


To 
comfort 
their 
customers—statesmen, 
businessmen, 
and 
students— 
these 
scholars 
have 
developed 
the 
trend 
doctrine. 
They 
assume 
that 
trends 
that 
prevailed 
in 
the 
recent 
past—inappropriately 
often 
dubbed 
the 
present— 
will 
also 
continue 
in 
the 
future. 
If 
they 
consider 
the 
trend 
as 
undesirable, 
they 
recommend 
measures 
to 
change 
it. 
If 
they 
consider 
it 
as 
desirable, 
they 
are 



inclined 
to 
declare 
it 
as 
inevitable 
and 
irresistible 
and 
do 
not 
take 
into 
account 
the 
fact 
that 
trends 
manifested 
in 
history 
can 
change, 
often 
or 
rather 
always 
did 
change, 
and 
may 
change 
even 
in 
the 
immediate 
future. 


7. 
Decision-making 
There 
are 
fads 
and 
fashions 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
scientific 
problems 
and 
in 
the 
terminology 
of 
the 
scientific 
language. 


What 
praxeology 
calls 
choosing 
is 
nowadays, 
as 
far 
as 
it 
concerns 
the 
choice 
of 
means, 
called 
decision-making. 
The 
neologism 
is 
designed 
to 
divert 
attention 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
what 
matters 
is 
not 
simply 
to 
make 
a 
choice, 
but 
to 
make 
the 
best 
possible 
choice. 
This 
means: 
to 
proceed 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
no 
less 
urgently 
desired 
end 
should 
be 
satisfied 
if 
its 
satisfaction 
prevents 
the 
attainment 
of 
a 
more 
urgently 
desired 
end. 
In 
the 
production 
processes 
directed 
in 
the 
market 
economy 
by 
profit-seeking 
business 
this 
is 
accomplished 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
with 
the 
intellectual 
aid 
of 
economic 
calculation. 
In 
a 
self-sufficient, 
closed, 
socialist 
system, 
which 
cannot 
resort 
to 
any 
economic 
calculation, 
the 
making 
of 
decisions 
concerning 
means 
is 
mere 
gambling. 


8. 
Confirmation 
and 
Refutability 
In 
the 
natural 
sciences 
a 
theory 
can 
be 
maintained 
only 
if 
it 
is 
in 
agreement 
with 
experimentally 
established 
facts. 
This 
agreement 
was, 
up 
to 
a 
short 
time 
ago, 
considered 
as 
confirmation. 
Karl 
Popper, 
in 
1935, 
in 
Logik 
und 
Forschung3 
pointed 
out 
that 
facts 
cannot 
confirm 
a 
theory; 
they 
can 
only 
refute 
it. 
Hence 
a 
more 
correct 
formulation 
has 
to 
declare: 
A 
theory 
cannot 
be 
maintained 
if 
it 
is 
refuted 
by 
the 
data 
of 
experience. 
In 
this 
way 
experience 
restricts 
the 
scientist’s 
discretion 
in 
constructing 
theories. 
A 
hypothesis 
has 
to 
be 
dropped 
when 
experiments 
show 
that 
it 
is 
incompatible 
with 
the 
established 
facts 
of 
experience. 


It 
is 
obvious 
that 
all 
this 
cannot 
refer 
in 
any 
way 
to 
the 
problems 
of 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action. 
There 
are 
in 
this 
orbit 
no 
such 
things 
as 
experimentally 
established 
facts. 
All 
experience 
in 
this 
field 
is, 
as 
must 
be 
repeated 
again 
and 
again, 
historical 
experience, 
that 
is, 
experience 
of 
complex 
phenomena. 
Such 
an 
experience 
can 
never 
produce 
something 
having 
the 
logical 
character 
of 
what 
the 
natural 
sciences 
call 
“facts 
of 



experience.” 


If 
one 
accepts 
the 
terminology 
of 
logical 
positivism 
and 
especially 
also 
that 
of 
Popper, 
a 
theory 
or 
hypothesis 
is 
“unscientific” 
if 
in 
principle 
it 
cannot 
be 
refuted 
by 
experience. 
Consequently, 
all 
a 
priori 
theories, 
including 
mathematics 
and 
praxeology, 
are 
“unscientific.” 
This 
is 
merely 
a 
verbal 
quibble. 
No 
serious 
man 
wastes 
his 
time 
in 
discussing 
such 
a 
terminological 
question. 
Praxeology 
and 
economics 
will 
retain 
their 
paramount 
significance 
for 
human 
life 
and 
action 
however 
people 
may 
classify 
and 
describe 
them. 


The 
popular 
prestige 
that 
the 
natural 
sciences 
enjoy 
in 
our 
civilization 
is, 
of 
course, 
not 
founded 
upon 
the 
merely 
negative 
condition 
that 
their 
theorems 
have 
not 
been 
refuted. 
There 
is, 
apart 
from 
the 
outcome 
of 
laboratory 
experiments, 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
machines 
and 
all 
other 
implements 
constructed 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
teachings 
of 
science 
run 
in 
the 
way 
anticipated 
on 
the 
ground 
of 
these 
teachings. 
The 
electricity-driven 
motors 
and 
engines 
provide 
a 
confirmation 
of 
the 
theories 
of 
electricity 
upon 
which 
their 
production 
and 
operation 
were 
founded. 
Sitting 
in 
a 
room 
that 
is 
lighted 
by 
electric 
bulbs, 
equipped 
with 
a 
telephone, 
cooled 
by 
an 
electric 
fan, 
and 
cleaned 
by 
a 
vacuum 
cleaner, 
the 
philosopher 
as 
well 
as 
the 
layman 
cannot 
help 
admitting 
that 
there 
may 
be 
something 
more 
in 
the 
theories 
of 
electricity 
than 
that 
up 
to 
now 
they 
have 
not 
been 
refuted 
by 
an 
experiment. 


9. 
The 
Examination 
of 
Praxeological 
Theorems 
The 
epistemologist 
who 
starts 
his 
lucubrations 
from 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
methods 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
and 
whom 
blinkers 
prevent 
from 
perceiving 
anything 
beyond 
this 
field 
tells 
us 
merely 
that 
the 
natural 
sciences 
are 
the 
natural 
sciences 
and 
that 
what 
is 
not 
natural 
science 
is 
not 
natural 
science. 
About 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
he 
does 
not 
know 
anything, 
and 
therefore 
all 
that 
he 
utters 
about 
them 
is 
of 
no 
consequence. 


It 
is 
not 
a 
discovery 
made 
by 
these 
authors 
that 
the 
theories 
of 
praxeology 
cannot 
be 
refuted 
by 
experiments 
nor 
confirmed 
by 
their 
successful 
employment 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
various 
gadgets. 
These 
facts 
are 
precisely 
one 
aspect 
of 
our 
problem. 


The 
positivist 
doctrine 
implies 
that 
nature 
and 
reality, 
in 
providing 
the 
sense 
data 
that 
the 
protocol 
sentences 
register, 
write 
their 
own 
story 
upon 
the 
white 
sheet 
of 
the 
human 
mind. 
The 
kind 
of 
experience 
to 
which 
they 
refer 
in 
speaking 
of 
verifiability 
and 
refutability 
is, 
as 
they 
think, 
something 
that 
does 



not 
depend 
in 
any 
way 
on 
the 
logical 
structure 
of 
the 
human 
mind. 
It 
provides 
a 
faithful 
image 
of 
reality. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
they 
suppose, 
reason 
is 
arbitrary 
and 
therefore 
liable 
to 
error 
and 
misinterpretation. 


This 
doctrine 
not 
only 
fails 
to 
make 
allowance 
for 
the 
fallibility 
of 
our 
apprehension 
of 
sense 
objects; 
it 
does 
not 
realize 
that 
perception 
is 
more 
than 
just 
sensuous 
apprehension, 
that 
it 
is 
an 
intellectual 
act 
performed 
by 
the 
mind. 
In 
this 
regard 
both 
associationism 
and 
Gestalt 
psychology 
agree. 
There 
is 
no 
reason 
to 
ascribe 
to 
the 
operation 
the 
mind 
performs 
in 
the 
act 
of 
becoming 
aware 
of 
an 
external 
object 
a 
higher 
epistemological 
dignity 
than 
to 
the 
operation 
the 
mind 
performs 
in 
describing 
its 
own 
ways 
of 
procedure. 


In 
fact, 
nothing 
is 
more 
certain 
for 
the 
human 
mind 
than 
what 
the 
category 
of 
human 
action 
brings 
into 
relief. 
There 
is 
no 
human 
being 
to 
whom 
the 
intent 
is 
foreign 
to 
substitute 
by 
appropriate 
conduct 
one 
state 
of 
affairs 
for 
another 
state 
of 
affairs 
that 
would 
prevail 
if 
he 
did 
not 
interfere. 
Only 
where 
there 
is 
action 
are 
there 
men. 


What 
we 
know 
about 
our 
own 
actions 
and 
about 
those 
of 
other 
people 
is 
conditioned 
by 
our 
familiarity 
with 
the 
category 
of 
action 
that 
we 
owe 
to 
a 
process 
of 
self-examination 
and 
introspection 
as 
well 
as 
of 
understanding 
of 
other 
peoples’ 
conduct. 
To 
question 
this 
insight 
is 
no 
less 
impossible 
than 
to 
question 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
are 
alive. 


He 
who 
wants 
to 
attack 
a 
praxeological 
theorem 
has 
to 
trace 
it 
back, 
step 
by 
step, 
until 
he 
reaches 
a 
point 
in 
which, 
in 
the 
chain 
of 
reasoning 
that 
resulted 
in 
the 
theorem 
concerned, 
a 
logical 
error 
can 
be 
unmasked. 
But 
if 
this 
regressive 
process 
of 
deduction 
ends 
at 
the 
category 
of 
action 
without 
having 
discovered 
a 
vicious 
link 
in 
the 
chain 
of 
reasoning, 
the 
theorem 
is 
fully 
confirmed. 
Those 
positivists 
who 
reject 
such 
a 
theorem 
without 
having 
subjected 
it 
to 
this 
examination 
are 
no 
less 
foolish 
than 
those 
seventeenth-
century 
astronomers 
were 
who 
refused 
to 
look 
through 
the 
telescope 
that 
would 
have 
shown 
them 
that 
Galileo 
was 
right 
and 
they 
were 
wrong. 



5 


On 
Some 
Popular 
Errors 
Concerning 
the 
Scope 
and 
Method 
of 
Economics 


1. 
The 
Research 
Fable 
The 
popular 
ideas 
concerning 
the 
methods 
the 
economists 
employ 
or 
ought 
to 
employ 
in 
the 
pursuit 
of 
their 
studies 
are 
fashioned 
by 
the 
belief 
that 
the 
methods 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
are 
also 
adequate 
for 
the 
study 
of 
human 
action. 
This 
fable 
is 
supported 
by 
the 
usage 
that 
mistakes 
economic 
history 
for 
economics. 
A 
historian, 
whether 
he 
deals 
with 
what 
is 
called 
general 
history 
or 
with 
economic 
history, 
has 
to 
study 
and 
to 
analyze 
the 
available 
records. 
He 
must 
embark 
upon 
research. 
Although 
the 
research 
activities 
of 
a 
historian 
are 
epistemologically 
and 
methodologically 
different 
from 
those 
of 
a 
physicist 
or 
a 
biologist, 
there 
is 
no 
harm 
in 
employing 
for 
all 
of 
them 
the 
same 
appellation, 
viz., 
research. 
Research 
is 
not 
only 
time-consuming. 
It 
is 
also 
more 
or 
less 
expensive. 


But 
economics 
is 
not 
history. 
Economics 
is 
a 
branch 
of 
praxeology, 
the 
aprioristic 
theory 
of 
human 
action. 
The 
economist 
does 
not 
base 
his 
theories 
upon 
historical 
research, 
but 
upon 
theoretical 
thinking 
like 
that 
of 
the 
logician 
or 
the 
mathematician. 
Although 
history 
is, 
like 
all 
other 
sciences, 
at 
the 
background 
of 
his 
studies, 
he 
does 
not 
learn 
directly 
from 
history. 
It 
is, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
economic 
history 
that 
needs 
to 
be 
interpreted 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
theories 
developed 
by 
economics. 


The 
reason 
is 
obvious, 
as 
has 
been 
pointed 
out 
already. 
The 
historian 



can 
never 
derive 
theorems 
about 
cause 
and 
effect 
from 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
material 
available. 
Historical 
experience 
is 
not 
laboratory 
experience. 
It 
is 
experience 
of 
complex 
phenomena, 
of 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
joint 
operation 
of 
various 
forces. 


This 
shows 
why 
it 
is 
wrong 
to 
contend 
that 
“it 
is 
from 
observation 
that 
even 
deductive 
economics 
obtains 
its 
ultimate 
premises.”1 
What 
we 
can 
“observe” 
is 
always 
only 
complex 
phenomena. 
What 
economic 
history, 
observation, 
or 
experience 
can 
tell 
us 
is 
facts 
like 
these: 
Over 
a 
definite 
period 
of 
the 
past 
the 
miner 
John 
in 
the 
coal 
mines 
of 
the 
X 
company 
in 
the 
village 
of 
Y 
earned 
p 
dollars 
for 
a 
working 
day 
of 
n 
hours. 
There 
is 
no 
way 
that 
would 
lead 
from 
the 
assemblage 
of 
such 
and 
similar 
data 
to 
any 
theory 
concerning 
the 
factors 
determining 
the 
height 
of 
wage 
rates. 


There 
are 
plenty 
of 
institutions 
for 
alleged 
economic 
research. 
They 
collect 
various 
materials, 
comment 
in 
a 
more 
or 
less 
arbitrary 
way 
upon 
the 
events 
to 
which 
these 
materials 
refer, 
and 
are 
even 
bold 
enough 
to 
make, 
on 
the 
ground 
of 
this 
knowledge 
about 
the 
past, 
prognostications 
concerning 
the 
future 
course 
of 
business 
affairs. 
Considering 
forecasting 
the 
future 
as 
their 
main 
objective, 
they 
call 
the 
series 
of 
data 
collected 
“tools.” 
Considering 
the 
elaboration 
of 
plans 
for 
governmental 
action 
as 
their 
most 
eminent 
pursuit, 
they 
aspire 
to 
the 
role 
of 
an 
“economic 
general 
staff” 
assisting 
the 
supreme 
commander 
of 
the 
nation’s 
economic 
effort. 
Competing 
with 
the 
research 
institutes 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
for 
government 
and 
foundation 
grants, 
they 
call 
their 
offices 
“laboratories” 
and 
their 
methods 
“experimental.” 
Their 
effort 
may 
be 
highly 
appreciated 
from 
some 
points 
of 
view. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
economics. 
It 
is 
economic 
history 
of 
the 
recent 
past. 


2. 
The 
Study 
of 
Motives 
Public 
opinion 
still 
labors 
under 
the 
failure 
of 
classical 
economics 
to 
come 
to 
grips 
with 
the 
problem 
of 
value. 
Unable 
to 
solve 
the 
apparent 
paradox 
of 
valuation, 
the 
classical 
economists 
could 
not 
trace 
the 
chain 
of 
market 
transactions 
back 
to 
the 
consumer, 
but 
were 
forced 
to 
start 
their 
reasoning 
from 
the 
actions 
of 
the 
businessman, 
for 
whom 
the 
valuations 
of 
the 
buyers 
are 
a 
given 
fact. 
The 
conduct 
of 
the 
businessman 
in 
his 
capacity 
as 
a 
merchant 
serving 
the 
public 
is 
pertinently 
described 
by 
the 
formula: 
Buy 
in 
the 
cheapest 
and 
sell 
in 
the 
dearest 
market. 
The 
second 
part 
of 
this 
formula 
refers 
to 
the 
conduct 
of 
the 
buyers 
whose 
valuations 
determine 
the 
height 
of 



the 
prices 
they 
are 
prepared 
to 
pay 
for 
the 
merchandise. 
But 
nothing 
is 
said 
about 
the 
process 
that 
sets 
up 
these 
valuations. 
They 
are 
looked 
upon 
as 
given 
data. 
If 
one 
accepts 
this 
oversimplified 
formula, 
it 
is 
certainly 
possible 
to 
distinguish 
between 
businesslike 
conduct 
(falsely 
termed 
economic 
or 
rational 
conduct) 
and 
conduct 
determined 
by 
other 
considerations 
than 
those 
of 
business 
(falsely 
termed 
uneconomic 
or 
irrational 
conduct). 
But 
this 
mode 
of 
classification 
does 
not 
make 
any 
sense 
if 
we 
apply 
it 
to 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
consumer. 


The 
harm 
done 
by 
such 
and 
similar 
attempts 
to 
make 
distinctions 
was 
that 
they 
removed 
economics 
from 
reality. 
The 
task 
of 
economics, 
as 
many 
epigones 
of 
the 
classical 
economists 
practised 
it, 
was 
to 
deal 
not 
with 
events 
as 
they 
really 
happened, 
but 
only 
with 
forces 
that 
contributed 
in 
some 
not 
clearly 
defined 
manner 
to 
the 
emergence 
of 
what 
really 
happened. 
Economics 
did 
not 
actually 
aim 
at 
explaining 
the 
formation 
of 
market 
prices, 
but 
at 
the 
description 
of 
something 
that 
together 
with 
other 
factors 
played 
a 
certain, 
not 
clearly 
described 
role 
in 
this 
process. 
Virtually 
it 
did 
not 
deal 
with 
real 
living 
beings, 
but 
with 
a 
phantom, 
“economic 
man,” 
a 
creature 
essentially 
different 
from 
real 
man. 


The 
absurdity 
of 
this 
doctrine 
becomes 
manifest 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
question 
is 
raised 
in 
what 
this 
economic 
man 
differs 
from 
real 
man. 
He 
is 
considered 
as 
a 
perfect 
egoist, 
as 
omniscient, 
and 
as 
exclusively 
intent 
upon 
accumulating 
more 
and 
more 
wealth. 
But 
it 
does 
not 
make 
any 
difference 
for 
the 
determination 
of 
market 
prices 
whether 
an 
“egoistic” 
buyer 
buys 
because 
he 
wants 
himself 
to 
enjoy 
what 
he 
bought 
or 
whether 
an 
“altruistic” 
buyer 
buys 
for 
some 
other 
reasons, 
for 
instance 
in 
order 
to 
make 
a 
gift 
to 
a 
charitable 
institution. 
Neither 
does 
it 
make 
any 
difference 
on 
the 
market 
whether 
the 
consumer 
in 
buying 
is 
guided 
by 
opinions 
that 
an 
unaffected 
spectator 
considers 
as 
true 
or 
false. 
He 
buys 
because 
he 
believes 
that 
to 
acquire 
the 
merchandise 
in 
question 
will 
satisfy 
him 
better 
than 
keeping 
the 
money 
or 
spending 
it 
for 
something 
else. 
Whether 
or 
not 
he 
aims 
at 
accumulating 
wealth, 
he 
always 
aims 
at 
employing 
what 
he 
owns 
for 
those 
ends 
which, 
as 
he 
thinks, 
will 
satisfy 
him 
best. 


There 
is 
only 
one 
motive 
that 
determines 
all 
the 
actions 
of 
all 
men, 
viz., 
to 
remove, 
directly 
or 
indirectly, 
as 
much 
as 
possible 
any 
uneasiness 
felt. 
In 
the 
pursuit 
of 
this 
aim 
men 
are 
affected 
with 
all 
the 
frailties 
and 
weaknesses 
of 
human 
existence. 
What 
determines 
the 
real 
course 
of 
events, 
the 
formation 
of 
prices 
and 
all 
other 
phenomena 
commonly 
called 
economic 
as 
well 
as 
all 



other 
events 
of 
human 
history, 
is 
the 
attitudes 
of 
these 
fallible 
men 
and 
the 
effects 
produced 
by 
their 
actions 
liable 
to 
error. 
The 
eminence 
of 
the 
approach 
of 
modern 
marginal 
utility 
economics 
consists 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
pays 
full 
attention 
to 
this 
state 
of 
affairs. 
It 
does 
not 
deal 
with 
the 
actions 
of 
an 
ideal 
man, 
essentially 
different 
from 
real 
man, 
but 
with 
the 
choices 
of 
all 
those 
who 
participate 
in 
social 
cooperation 
under 
the 
division 
of 
labor. 


Economics, 
say 
many 
of 
its 
critics, 
assumes 
that 
everybody 
behaves 
in 
all 
his 
actions 
in 
a 
perfectly 
“rational” 
way 
and 
aims 
exclusively 
at 
the 
highest 
possible 
gain 
like 
the 
speculators 
buying 
and 
selling 
on 
the 
stock 
exchange. 
But 
real 
man, 
they 
assert, 
is 
different. 
He 
aims 
also 
at 
other 
ends 
than 
material 
advantage 
that 
can 
be 
expressed 
in 
monetary 
terms. 


There 
is 
a 
whole 
bundle 
of 
errors 
and 
misunderstandings 
in 
this 
popular 
reasoning. 
The 
man 
who 
operates 
on 
the 
stock 
exchange 
is 
driven 
in 
this 
activity 
by 
one 
intention 
only, 
to 
enlarge 
his 
own 
competence. 
But 
exactly 
the 
same 
intention 
animates 
the 
acquisitive 
activity 
of 
all 
other 
people. 
The 
farmer 
wants 
to 
sell 
his 
produce 
at 
the 
highest 
price 
he 
can 
obtain, 
and 
the 
wage 
earner 
is 
anxious 
to 
sell 
his 
effort 
at 
the 
highest 
price 
obtainable. 
The 
fact 
that 
in 
comparing 
the 
remuneration 
that 
is 
offered 
to 
him 
the 
seller 
of 
commodities 
or 
services 
takes 
into 
account 
not 
only 
what 
he 
gets 
in 
terms 
of 
money 
but 
also 
all 
other 
benefits 
involved 
is 
fully 
consonant 
with 
his 
behavior 
as 
characterized 
in 
this 
description. 


The 
specific 
goals 
that 
people 
aim 
at 
in 
action 
are 
very 
different 
and 
continually 
change. 
But 
all 
acting 
is 
invariably 
induced 
by 
one 
motive 
only, 
viz., 
to 
substitute 
a 
state 
that 
suits 
the 
actor 
better 
for 
the 
state 
that 
would 
prevail 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
his 
action. 


3. 
Theory 
and 
Practice 
A 
popular 
opinion 
considers 
economics 
as 
the 
science 
of 
business 
transactions. 
It 
assumes 
that 
economics 
is 
in 
the 
same 
relationship 
to 
the 
activities 
of 
a 
businessman 
as 
is 
the 
discipline 
of 
technology 
taught 
at 
schools 
and 
expounded 
in 
books 
to 
the 
activities 
of 
mechanics, 
engineers, 
and 
artisans. 
The 
businessman 
is 
the 
doer 
of 
things 
about 
which 
the 
economist 
merely 
talks 
and 
writes. 
Hence 
a 
businessman 
has, 
in 
his 
capacity 
as 
a 
practician, 
a 
better 
founded 
and 
more 
realistic 
knowledge, 
inside 
information, 
about 
the 
problems 
of 
economics 
than 
the 
theorist 
who 
observes 
the 
affairs 
of 
trade 
from 
without. 
The 
best 
method 
the 
theorist 
can 
choose 
to 
learn 



something 
about 
real 
conditions 
is 
to 
listen 
to 
what 
the 
performers 
say. 


However, 
economics 
is 
not 
specifically 
about 
business; 
it 
deals 
with 
all 
market 
phenomena 
and 
with 
all 
their 
aspects, 
not 
only 
with 
the 
activities 
of 
a 
businessman. 
The 
conduct 
of 
the 
consumer—i.e., 
of 
everybody—is 
no 
less 
a 
topic 
of 
economic 
studies 
than 
that 
of 
anybody 
else. 
The 
businessman 
is, 
in 
his 
capacity 
as 
a 
businessman, 
not 
more 
closely 
related 
to 
or 
involved 
in 
the 
process 
that 
produces 
market 
phenomena 
than 
anybody 
else. 
The 
position 
of 
the 
economist 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
object 
of 
his 
studies 
is 
not 
to 
be 
compared 
to 
that 
of 
the 
author 
of 
books 
on 
technology 
to 
the 
practical 
engineers 
and 
workmen 
but 
rather 
to 
that 
of 
the 
biologist 
to 
the 
living 
beings—including 
men—whose 
vital 
functions 
he 
tries 
to 
describe. 
Not 
people 
with 
the 
best 
eyesight 
are 
experts 
in 
ophthalmology, 
but 
ophthalmologists 
even 
if 
they 
are 
myopic. 


It 
is 
a 
historical 
fact 
that 
some 
businessmen, 
foremost 
among 
them 
David 
Ricardo, 
made 
outstanding 
contributions 
to 
economic 
theory. 
But 
there 
were 
other 
eminent 
economists 
who 
were 
“mere” 
theorists. 
What 
is 
wrong 
with 
the 
discipline 
that 
is 
nowadays 
taught 
in 
most 
universities 
under 
the 
misleading 
label 
of 
economics 
is 
not 
that 
the 
teachers 
and 
the 
authors 
of 
the 
textbooks 
are 
either 
not 
businessmen 
or 
failed 
in 
their 
business 
enterprises. 
The 
fault 
is 
with 
their 
ignorance 
of 
economics 
and 
with 
their 
inability 
to 
think 
logically. 


The 
economist—like 
the 
biologist 
and 
the 
psychologist—deals 
with 
matters 
that 
are 
present 
and 
operative 
in 
every 
man. 
This 
distinguishes 
his 
work 
from 
that 
of 
the 
ethnologist 
who 
wants 
to 
record 
the 
mores 
and 
habits 
of 
a 
primitive 
tribe. 
The 
economist 
need 
not 
displace 
himself; 
he 
can, 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
sneers, 
like 
the 
logician 
and 
the 
mathematician, 
accomplish 
his 
job 
in 
an 
armchair. 
What 
distinguishes 
him 
from 
other 
people 
is 
not 
the 
esoteric 
opportunity 
to 
deal 
with 
some 
special 
material 
not 
accessible 
to 
others, 
but 
the 
way 
he 
looks 
upon 
things 
and 
discovers 
in 
them 
aspects 
which 
other 
people 
fail 
to 
notice. 
It 
was 
this 
that 
Philip 
Wicksteed 
had 
in 
mind 
when 
he 
chose 
for 
his 
great 
treatise 
a 
motto 
from 
Goethe’s 
Faust: 
Human 
life— 
everybody 
lives 
it, 
but 
only 
to 
a 
few 
is 
it 
known. 


4. 
The 
Pitfalls 
of 
Hypostatization 
The 
worst 
enemy 
of 
clear 
thinking 
is 
the 
propensity 
to 
hypostatize, 
i.e., 
to 
ascribe 
substance 
or 
real 
existence 
to 
mental 
constructs 
or 
concepts. 



In 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
the 
most 
conspicuous 
instance 
of 
this 
fallacy 
is 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
term 
society 
is 
employed 
by 
various 
schools 
of 
pseudo 
science. 
There 
is 
no 
harm 
in 
employing 
the 
term 
to 
signify 
the 
cooperation 
of 
individuals 
united 
in 
endeavors 
to 
attain 
definite 
ends. 
It 
is 
a 
definite 
aspect 
of 
various 
individuals’ 
actions 
that 
constitutes 
what 
is 
called 
society 
or 
the 
“great 
society.” 
But 
society 
itself 
is 
neither 
a 
substance, 
nor 
a 
power, 
nor 
an 
acting 
being. 
Only 
individuals 
act. 
Some 
of 
the 
individuals’ 
actions 
are 
directed 
by 
the 
intention 
to 
cooperate 
with 
others. 
Cooperation 
of 
individuals 
brings 
about 
a 
state 
of 
affairs 
which 
the 
concept 
of 
society 
describes. 
Society 
does 
not 
exist 
apart 
from 
the 
thoughts 
and 
actions 
of 
people. 
It 
does 
not 
have 
“interests” 
and 
does 
not 
aim 
at 
anything. 
The 
same 
is 
valid 
for 
all 
other 
collectives. 


Hypostatization 
is 
not 
merely 
an 
epistemological 
fallacy 
and 
not 
only 
misleads 
the 
search 
for 
knowledge. 
In 
the 
so-called 
social 
sciences 
it 
more 
often 
than 
not 
serves 
definite 
political 
aspirations 
in 
claiming 
for 
the 
collective 
as 
such 
a 
higher 
dignity 
than 
for 
the 
individual 
or 
even 
ascribing 
real 
existence 
only 
to 
the 
collective 
and 
denying 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
individual, 
calling 
it 
a 
mere 
abstraction. 


The 
collectivists 
themselves 
disagree 
with 
one 
another 
in 
the 
appreciation 
of 
the 
various 
collectivistic 
constructs. 
They 
claim 
a 
higher 
reality 
and 
moral 
dignity 
for 
one 
collective 
than 
for 
others 
or, 
in 
a 
more 
radical 
way, 
even 
deny 
both 
real 
existence 
and 
dignity 
to 
the 
collectivistic 
constructs 
of 
other 
people. 
Thus, 
nationalists 
consider 
the 
“nation” 
as 
the 
only 
true 
collective, 
to 
which 
alone 
all 
individuals 
they 
consider 
as 
conationals 
owe 
allegiance, 
and 
stigmatize 
all 
other 
collectives—e.g., 
the 
religious 
communities—as 
of 
minor 
rank. 
However, 
epistemology 
does 
not 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
political 
controversies 
implied. 


In 
denying 
perseity, 
i.e., 
independent 
existence 
of 
their 
own, 
to 
the 
collectives, 
one 
does 
not 
in 
the 
least 
deny 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
effects 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
cooperation 
of 
individuals. 
One 
merely 
establishes 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
collectives 
come 
into 
being 
by 
the 
thoughts 
and 
actions 
of 
individuals 
and 
that 
they 
disappear 
when 
the 
individuals 
adopt 
a 
different 
way 
of 
thinking 
and 
acting. 
The 
thoughts 
and 
actions 
of 
a 
definite 
individual 
are 
instrumental 
in 
the 
emergence 
not 
only 
of 
one, 
but 
of 
various 
collectives. 
Thus, 
e.g., 
the 
same 
individual’s 
various 
attitudes 
may 
serve 
to 
constitute 
the 
collectives 
nation, 
religious 
community, 
political 
party, 
and 
so 
on. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
a 
man 
may, 
without 
discontinuing 
entirely 
his 
belonging 
to 
a 
definite 



collective, 
occasionally 
or 
even 
regularly 
in 
some 
of 
his 
actions 
proceed 
in 
a 
way 
that 
is 
incompatible 
with 
the 
preservation 
of 
his 
membership. 
Thus, 
e.g., 
it 
happened 
in 
the 
recent 
history 
of 
various 
nations 
that 
practising 
Catholics 
cast 
their 
votes 
in 
favor 
of 
candidates 
who 
openly 
avowed 
their 
hostility 
to 
the 
political 
aspirations 
of 
the 
Church 
and 
spurned 
its 
dogmas 
as 
fables. 
In 
dealing 
with 
collectives, 
the 
historian 
must 
pay 
attention 
to 
the 
degree 
to 
which 
the 
various 
ideas 
of 
cooperation 
determine 
the 
thinking 
and 
the 
actions 
of 
their 
members. 
Thus, 
in 
dealing 
with 
the 
history 
of 
the 
Italian 
Risorgimento, 
he 
has 
to 
investigate 
to 
what 
extent 
and 
in 
what 
manner 
the 
idea 
of 
an 
Italian 
national 
state 
and 
to 
what 
extent 
and 
in 
what 
manner 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
secular 
papal 
state 
influenced 
the 
attitudes 
of 
the 
various 
individuals 
and 
groups 
whose 
conduct 
is 
the 
subject 
of 
his 
studies. 


The 
political 
and 
ideological 
conditions 
of 
the 
Germany 
of 
his 
day 
induced 
Marx 
to 
employ, 
in 
the 
announcement 
of 
his 
program 
of 
nationalization 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
the 
term 
“society” 
instead 
of 
the 
term 
“state” 
(Staat), 
which 
is 
the 
German 
equivalent 
of 
the 
English 
term 
“nation.” 
The 
socialist 
propaganda 
endowed 
the 
term 
“society” 
and 
the 
adjective 
“social” 
with 
an 
aura 
of 
sanctity 
that 
is 
manifested 
by 
the 
quasi-
religious 
esteem 
that 
what 
is 
called 
“social 
work,” 
i.e., 
the 
management 
of 
the 
distribution 
of 
alms 
and 
similar 
activities, 
enjoys. 


5. 
On 
the 
Rejection 
of 
Methodological 
Individualism 
No 
sensible 
proposition 
concerning 
human 
action 
can 
be 
asserted 
without 
reference 
to 
what 
the 
acting 
individuals 
are 
aiming 
at 
and 
what 
they 
consider 
as 
success 
or 
failure, 
as 
profit 
or 
loss. 
If 
we 
study 
the 
actions 
of 
the 
individuals, 
we 
learn 
everything 
that 
can 
be 
learned 
about 
acting, 
as 
there 
are, 
as 
far 
as 
we 
can 
see, 
in 
the 
universe 
no 
other 
entities 
or 
beings 
that, 
dissatisfied 
with 
the 
state 
of 
affairs 
that 
would 
prevail 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
their 
interference, 
are 
intent 
upon 
improving 
conditions 
by 
action. 
In 
studying 
action, 
we 
become 
aware 
both 
of 
the 
powers 
of 
man 
and 
of 
the 
limits 
of 
his 
powers. 
Man 
lacks 
omnipotence 
and 
can 
never 
attain 
a 
state 
of 
full 
and 
lasting 
satisfaction. 
All 
he 
can 
do 
is 
to 
substitute, 
by 
resorting 
to 
appropriate 
means, 
a 
state 
of 
lesser 
dissatisfaction 
for 
a 
state 
of 
greater 
dissatisfaction. 


In 
studying 
the 
actions 
of 
individuals, 
we 
learn 
also 
everything 
about 
the 
collectives 
and 
society. 
For 
the 
collective 
has 
no 
existence 
and 
reality 
but 
in 
the 
actions 
of 
individuals. 
It 
comes 
into 
existence 
by 
ideas 
that 
move 



individuals 
to 
behave 
as 
members 
of 
a 
definite 
group 
and 
goes 
out 
of 
existence 
when 
the 
persuasive 
power 
of 
these 
ideas 
subsides. 
The 
only 
way 
to 
a 
cognition 
of 
collectives 
is 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
conduct 
of 
its 
members. 


There 
is 
no 
need 
to 
add 
anything 
to 
what 
has 
already 
been 
said 
by 
praxeology 
and 
economics 
to 
justify 
methodological 
individualism 
and 
to 
reject 
the 
mythology 
of 
methodological 
collectivism.2 
Even 
the 
most 
fanatical 
advocates 
of 
collectivism 
deal 
with 
the 
actions 
of 
individuals 
while 
they 
pretend 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
actions 
of 
collectives. 
Statistics 
does 
not 
register 
events 
that 
are 
happening 
in 
or 
to 
collectives. 
It 
records 
what 
happens 
with 
individuals 
forming 
definite 
groups. 
The 
criterion 
that 
determines 
the 
constitution 
of 
these 
groups 
is 
definite 
characteristics 
of 
the 
individuals. 
The 
first 
thing 
that 
has 
to 
be 
established 
in 
speaking 
of 
a 
social 
entity 
is 
the 
clear 
definition 
of 
what 
logically 
justifies 
counting 
or 
not 
counting 
an 
individual 
as 
a 
member 
of 
this 
group. 


This 
is 
valid 
also 
with 
regard 
to 
those 
groups 
that 
are 
seemingly 
constituted 
by 
“material 
facts 
and 
realities” 
and 
not 
by 
“mere” 
ideological 
factors, 
e.g., 
the 
groups 
of 
people 
descended 
from 
the 
same 
ancestry 
or 
those 
of 
people 
living 
in 
the 
same 
geographical 
area. 
It 
is 
neither 
“natural” 
nor 
“necessary” 
that 
the 
members 
of 
the 
same 
race 
or 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
same 
country 
cooperate 
with 
one 
another 
more 
closely 
than 
with 
members 
of 
other 
races 
or 
inhabitants 
of 
other 
countries. 
The 
ideas 
of 
race 
solidarity 
and 
racial 
hatred 
are 
no 
less 
ideas 
than 
any 
other 
ideas, 
and 
only 
where 
they 
are 
accepted 
by 
the 
individuals 
do 
they 
result 
in 
corresponding 
action. 
Also 
the 
primitive 
tribe 
of 
savages 
is 
kept 
together 
as 
an 
acting 
unit—a 
society—by 
the 
fact 
that 
its 
members 
are 
imbued 
with 
the 
idea 
that 
loyalty 
to 
the 
clan 
is 
the 
right 
way 
or 
even 
the 
only 
way 
open 
to 
them 
to 
take 
care 
of 
themselves. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
this 
primitive 
ideology 
was 
not 
seriously 
contested 
for 
thousands 
of 
years. 
But 
the 
fact 
that 
an 
ideology 
dominates 
people’s 
minds 
for 
a 
very 
long 
time 
does 
not 
alter 
its 
praxeological 
character. 
Other 
ideologies 
too 
enjoyed 
considerable 
longevity, 
e.g., 
the 
monarchical 
principle 
of 
government. 


The 
rejection 
of 
methodological 
individualism 
implies 
the 
assumption 
that 
the 
behavior 
of 
men 
is 
directed 
by 
some 
mysterious 
forces 
that 
defy 
any 
analysis 
and 
description. 
For 
if 
one 
realizes 
that 
what 
sets 
action 
in 
motion 
is 
ideas, 
one 
cannot 
help 
admitting 
that 
these 
ideas 
originate 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
some 
individuals 
and 
are 
transmitted 
to 
other 
individuals. 
But 
then 
one 
has 
accepted 
the 
fundamental 
thesis 
of 
methodological 
individualism, 
viz., 
that 
it 



is 
the 
ideas 
held 
by 
individuals 
that 
determine 
their 
group 
allegiance, 
and 
a 
collective 
no 
longer 
appears 
as 
an 
entity 
acting 
of 
its 
own 
accord 
and 
on 
its 
own 
initiative. 


All 
interhuman 
relations 
are 
the 
offshoot 
of 
ideas 
and 
the 
conduct 
of 
individuals 
directed 
by 
these 
ideas. 
The 
despot 
rules 
because 
his 
subjects 
chose 
rather 
to 
obey 
him 
than 
to 
resist 
him 
openly. 
The 
slaveholder 
is 
in 
a 
position 
to 
deal 
with 
his 
slaves 
as 
if 
they 
were 
chattels 
because 
the 
slaves 
are 
willy 
nilly 
prepared 
to 
yield 
to 
his 
pretensions. 
It 
is 
an 
ideological 
transformation 
that 
in 
our 
age 
weakens 
and 
threatens 
to 
dissolve 
entirely 
the 
authority 
of 
parents, 
teachers, 
and 
clergymen. 


The 
meaning 
of 
philosophical 
individualism 
has 
been 
lamentably 
misinterpreted 
by 
the 
harbingers 
of 
collectivism. 
As 
they 
see 
it, 
the 
dilemma 
is 
whether 
the 
concerns—interests—of 
the 
individuals 
should 
rank 
before 
those 
of 
one 
of 
the—arbitrarily 
selected—collectives. 
However, 
the 
epistemological 
controversy 
between 
individualism 
and 
collectivism 
has 
no 
direct 
reference 
to 
this 
purely 
political 
issue. 
Individualism 
as 
a 
principle 
of 
the 
philosophical, 
praxeological, 
and 
historical 
analysis 
of 
human 
action 
means 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
facts 
that 
all 
actions 
can 
be 
traced 
back 
to 
individuals 
and 
that 
no 
scientific 
method 
can 
succeed 
in 
determining 
how 
definite 
external 
events, 
liable 
to 
a 
description 
by 
the 
methods 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences, 
produce 
within 
the 
human 
mind 
definite 
ideas, 
value 
judgments, 
and 
volitions. 
In 
this 
sense 
the 
individual 
that 
cannot 
be 
dissolved 
into 
components 
is 
both 
the 
starting 
point 
and 
the 
ultimate 
given 
of 
all 
endeavors 
to 
deal 
with 
human 
action. 


The 
collectivistic 
method 
is 
anthropomorphic, 
as 
it 
simply 
takes 
it 
for 
granted 
that 
all 
concepts 
of 
the 
action 
of 
individuals 
can 
be 
applied 
to 
those 
of 
the 
collectives. 
It 
does 
not 
see 
that 
all 
collectives 
are 
the 
product 
of 
a 
definite 
way 
in 
which 
individuals 
act; 
they 
are 
an 
offshoot 
of 
ideas 
determining 
the 
conduct 
of 
individuals. 


6. 
The 
Approach 
of 
Macroeconomics 
The 
authors 
who 
think 
that 
they 
have 
substituted, 
in 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
market 
economy, 
a 
holistic 
or 
social 
or 
universalistic 
or 
institutional 
or 
macroeconomic 
approach 
for 
what 
they 
disdain 
as 
the 
spurious 
individualistic 
approach 
delude 
themselves 
and 
their 
public. 
For 
all 
reasoning 
concerning 
action 
must 
deal 
with 
valuation 
and 
with 
the 
striving 
after 
definite 
ends, 
as 



there 
is 
no 
action 
not 
oriented 
by 
final 
causes. 
It 
is 
possible 
to 
analyze 
conditions 
that 
would 
prevail 
within 
a 
socialist 
system 
in 
which 
only 
the 
supreme 
tsar 
determines 
all 
activities 
and 
all 
the 
other 
individuals 
efface 
their 
own 
personality 
and 
virtually 
convert 
themselves 
into 
mere 
tools 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
tsar’s 
actions. 
For 
the 
theory 
of 
integral 
socialism 
it 
may 
seem 
sufficient 
to 
consider 
the 
valuations 
and 
actions 
of 
the 
supreme 
tsar 
only. 
But 
if 
one 
deals 
with 
a 
system 
in 
which 
more 
than 
one 
man’s 
striving 
after 
definite 
ends 
directs 
or 
affects 
actions, 
one 
cannot 
avoid 
tracing 
back 
the 
effects 
produced 
by 
action 
to 
the 
point 
beyond 
which 
no 
analysis 
of 
actions 
can 
proceed, 
i.e., 
to 
the 
value 
judgments 
of 
the 
individuals 
and 
the 
ends 
they 
are 
aiming 
at. 


The 
macroeconomic 
approach 
looks 
upon 
an 
arbitrarily 
selected 
segment 
of 
the 
market 
economy 
(as 
a 
rule: 
upon 
one 
nation) 
as 
if 
it 
were 
an 
integrated 
unit. 
All 
that 
happens 
in 
this 
segment 
is 
actions 
of 
individuals 
and 
groups 
of 
individuals 
acting 
in 
concert. 
But 
macroeconomics 
proceeds 
as 
if 
all 
these 
individual 
actions 
were 
in 
fact 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
mutual 
operation 
of 
one 
macro-economic 
magnitude 
upon 
another 
such 
magnitude. 


The 
distinction 
between 
macroeconomics 
and 
microeconomics 
is, 
as 
far 
as 
terminology 
is 
concerned, 
borrowed 
from 
modern 
physics’ 
distinction 
between 
microscopic 
physics, 
which 
deals 
with 
systems 
on 
an 
atomic 
scale, 
and 
molar 
physics, 
which 
deals 
with 
systems 
on 
a 
scale 
appreciable 
to 
man’s 
gross 
senses. 
It 
implies 
that 
ideally 
the 
microscopic 
laws 
alone 
are 
sufficient 
to 
cover 
the 
whole 
field 
of 
phyics, 
the 
molar 
laws 
being 
merely 
a 
convenient 
adaptation 
of 
them 
to 
a 
special, 
but 
frequently 
occurring 
problem. 
Molar 
law 
appears 
as 
a 
condensed 
and 
bowdlerised 
version 
of 
microscopic 
law.3 
Thus 
the 
evolution 
that 
led 
from 
macroscopic 
physics 
to 
microscopic 
physics 
is 
seen 
as 
a 
progress 
from 
a 
less 
satisfactory 
to 
a 
more 
satisfactory 
method 
of 
dealing 
with 
the 
phenomena 
of 
reality. 


What 
the 
authors 
who 
introduced 
the 
distinction 
between 
macroeconomics 
and 
microeconomics 
into 
the 
terminology 
dealing 
with 
economic 
problems 
have 
in 
mind 
is 
precisely 
the 
opposite. 
Their 
doctrine 
implies 
that 
microeconomics 
is 
an 
unsatisfactory 
way 
of 
studying 
the 
problems 
involved 
and 
that 
the 
substitution 
of 
macroeconomics 
for 
microeconomics 
amounts 
to 
the 
elimination 
of 
an 
unsatisfactory 
method 
by 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
more 
satisfactory 
method. 


The 
macroeconomist 
deceives 
himself 
if 
in 
his 
reasoning 
he 
employs 
money 
prices 
determined 
on 
the 
market 
by 
individual 
buyers 
and 
sellers. 
A 



consistent 
macroeconomic 
approach 
would 
have 
to 
shun 
any 
reference 
to 
prices 
and 
to 
money. 
The 
market 
economy 
is 
a 
social 
system 
in 
which 
individuals 
are 
acting. 
The 
valuations 
of 
individuals 
as 
manifested 
in 
the 
market 
prices 
determine 
the 
course 
of 
all 
production 
activities. 
If 
one 
wants 
to 
oppose 
to 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
market 
economy 
the 
image 
of 
a 
holistic 
system, 
one 
must 
abstain 
from 
any 
use 
of 
prices. 


Let 
us 
exemplify 
one 
aspect 
of 
the 
fallacies 
of 
the 
macroeconomic 
method 
by 
an 
analysis 
of 
one 
of 
its 
most 
popular 
schemes, 
the 
so-called 
national 
income 
approach. 


Income 
is 
a 
concept 
of 
the 
accounting 
methods 
of 
profit-seeking 
business. 
The 
businessman 
serves 
the 
consumers 
in 
order 
to 
make 
profit. 
He 
keeps 
accounts 
to 
find 
out 
whether 
or 
not 
this 
goal 
has 
been 
attained. 
He 
(and 
likewise 
also 
capitalists, 
investors, 
who 
are 
not 
themselves 
active 
in 
business, 
and, 
of 
course, 
also 
farmers 
and 
owners 
of 
all 
kinds 
of 
real 
estate) 
compares 
the 
money 
equivalent 
of 
all 
the 
goods 
dedicated 
to 
the 
enterprise 
at 
two 
different 
instants 
of 
time 
and 
thus 
learns 
what 
the 
result 
of 
his 
transactions 
in 
the 
period 
between 
these 
two 
instants 
was. 
Out 
of 
such 
a 
calculation 
emerge 
the 
concepts 
of 
profit 
or 
loss 
as 
contrasted 
with 
that 
of 
capital. 
If 
the 
owner 
of 
the 
outfit 
to 
which 
this 
accounting 
refers 
calls 
the 
profit 
made 
“income,” 
what 
he 
means 
is: 
If 
I 
consume 
the 
whole 
of 
it, 
I 
do 
not 
reduce 
the 
capital 
invested 
in 
the 
enterprise. 


The 
modern 
tax 
laws 
call 
“income” 
not 
only 
what 
the 
accountant 
considers 
as 
the 
profit 
made 
by 
a 
definite 
business 
unit 
and 
what 
the 
owner 
of 
this 
unit 
considers 
as 
the 
income 
derived 
from 
the 
operations 
of 
this 
unit, 
but 
also 
the 
net 
earnings 
of 
professional 
people 
and 
the 
salaries 
and 
wages 
of 
employees. 
Adding 
together 
for 
the 
whole 
of 
a 
nation 
what 
is 
income 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
accountancy 
and 
what 
is 
income 
merely 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
tax 
laws, 
one 
gets 
the 
figure 
called 
“national 
income.” 


The 
illusiveness 
of 
this 
concept 
of 
national 
income 
is 
to 
be 
seen 
not 
only 
in 
its 
dependence 
on 
changes 
in 
the 
purchasing 
power 
of 
the 
monetary 
unit. 
The 
more 
inflation 
progresses, 
the 
higher 
rises 
the 
national 
income. 
Within 
an 
economic 
system 
in 
which 
there 
is 
no 
increase 
in 
the 
supply 
of 
money 
and 
fiduciary 
media, 
progressive 
accumulation 
of 
capital 
and 
the 
improvement 
of 
technological 
methods 
of 
production 
that 
it 
engenders 
would 
result 
in 
a 
progressive 
drop 
in 
prices 
or, 
what 
is 
the 
same, 
a 
rise 
in 
the 
purchasing 
power 
of 
the 
monetary 
unit. 
The 
amount 
of 
goods 
available 
for 
consumption 
would 
increase 
and 
the 
average 
standard 
of 
living 
would 
improve, 
but 
these 
changes 



would 
not 
be 
made 
visible 
in 
the 
figures 
of 
the 
national 
income 
statistics. 


The 
concept 
of 
national 
income 
entirely 
obliterates 
the 
real 
conditions 
of 
production 
within 
a 
market 
economy. 
It 
implies 
the 
idea 
that 
it 
is 
not 
activities 
of 
individuals 
that 
bring 
about 
the 
improvement 
(or 
impairment) 
in 
the 
quantity 
of 
goods 
available, 
but 
something 
that 
is 
above 
and 
outside 
these 
activities. 
This 
mysterious 
something 
produces 
a 
quantity 
called 
“national 
income,” 
and 
then 
a 
second 
process 
“distributes” 
this 
quantity 
among 
the 
various 
individuals. 
The 
political 
meaning 
of 
this 
method 
is 
obvious. 
One 
criticizes 
the 
“inequality” 
prevailing 
in 
the 
“distribution” 
of 
national 
income. 
One 
taboos 
the 
question 
what 
makes 
the 
national 
income 
rise 
or 
drop 
and 
implies 
that 
there 
is 
no 
inequality 
in 
the 
contributions 
and 
achievements 
of 
the 
individuals 
that 
are 
generating 
the 
total 
quantity 
of 
national 
income. 


If 
one 
raises 
the 
question 
what 
factors 
make 
the 
national 
income 
rise, 
one 
has 
only 
one 
answer: 
the 
improvement 
in 
equipment, 
the 
tools 
and 
machines 
employed 
in 
production, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
the 
improvement 
in 
the 
utilization 
of 
the 
available 
equipment 
for 
the 
best 
possible 
satisfaction 
of 
human 
wants, 
on 
the 
other 
hand. 
The 
former 
is 
the 
effect 
of 
saving 
and 
the 
accumulation 
of 
capital, 
the 
latter 
of 
technological 
skill 
and 
of 
entrepreneurial 
activities. 
If 
one 
calls 
an 
increase 
in 
national 
income 
(not 
produced 
by 
inflation) 
economic 
progress, 
one 
cannot 
avoid 
establishing 
the 
fact 
that 
economic 
progress 
is 
the 
fruit 
of 
the 
endeavors 
of 
the 
savers, 
of 
the 
inventors, 
and 
of 
the 
entrepreneurs. 
What 
an 
unbiased 
analysis 
of 
the 
national 
income 
would 
have 
to 
show 
is 
first 
of 
all 
the 
patent 
inequality 
in 
the 
contribution 
of 
various 
individuals 
to 
the 
emergence 
of 
the 
magnitude 
called 
national 
income. 
It 
would 
furthermore 
have 
to 
show 
how 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
per-head 
quota 
of 
capital 
employed 
and 
the 
perfection 
of 
technological 
and 
entrepreneurial 
activities 
benefit—by 
raising 
the 
marginal 
productivity 
of 
labor 
and 
thereby 
wage 
rates 
and 
by 
raising 
the 
prices 
paid 
for 
the 
utilization 
of 
natural 
resources—also 
those 
classes 
of 
individuals 
who 
themselves 
did 
not 
contribute 
to 
the 
improvement 
of 
conditions 
and 
the 
rise 
in 
“national 
income.” 


The 
“national 
income” 
approach 
is 
an 
abortive 
attempt 
to 
provide 
a 
justification 
for 
the 
Marxian 
idea 
that 
under 
capitalism 
goods 
are 
“socially” 
(gesellschaftlich) 
produced 
and 
then 
“appropriated” 
by 
individuals. 
It 
puts 
things 
upside 
down. 
In 
reality, 
the 
production 
processes 
are 
activities 
of 
individuals 
cooperating 
with 
one 
another. 
Each 
individual 
collaborator 
receives 
what 
his 
fellow 
men—competing 
with 
one 
another 
as 
buyers 
on 
the 



market—are 
prepared 
to 
pay 
for 
his 
contribution. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
argument 
one 
may 
admit 
that, 
adding 
up 
the 
prices 
paid 
for 
every 
individual’s 
contribution, 
one 
may 
call 
the 
resulting 
total 
national 
income. 
But 
it 
is 
a 
gratuitous 
pastime 
to 
conclude 
that 
this 
total 
has 
been 
produced 
by 
the 
“nation” 
and 
to 
bemoan—neglecting 
the 
inequality 
of 
the 
various 
individuals’ 
contributions—the 
inequality 
in 
its 
alleged 
distribution. 


There 
is 
no 
nonpolitical 
reason 
whatever 
to 
proceed 
with 
such 
a 
summing 
up 
of 
all 
incomes 
within 
a 
“nation” 
and 
not 
within 
a 
broader 
or 
a 
narrower 
collective. 
Why 
national 
income 
of 
the 
United 
States 
and 
not 
rather 
“state 
income” 
of 
the 
State 
of 
New 
York 
or 
“county 
income” 
of 
Westchester 
County 
or 
“municipal 
income” 
of 
the 
municipality 
of 
White 
Plains? 
All 
the 
arguments 
that 
can 
be 
advanced 
in 
favor 
of 
preferring 
the 
concept 
of 
“national 
income” 
of 
the 
United 
States 
against 
the 
income 
of 
any 
of 
these 
smaller 
territorial 
units 
can 
also 
be 
advanced 
in 
favor 
of 
preferring 
the 
continental 
income 
of 
all 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
American 
continent 
or 
even 
the 
“world 
income” 
as 
against 
the 
national 
income 
of 
the 
United 
States. 
It 
is 
merely 
political 
tendencies 
that 
make 
plausible 
the 
choice 
of 
the 
United 
States 
as 
the 
unit. 
Those 
responsible 
for 
this 
choice 
are 
critical 
of 
what 
they 
consider 
as 
the 
inequality 
of 
individual 
incomes 
within 
the 
United 
States—or 
within 
the 
territory 
of 
another 
sovereign 
nation—and 
aim 
at 
more 
equality 
of 
the 
incomes 
of 
the 
citizens 
of 
their 
own 
nation. 
They 
are 
neither 
in 
favor 
of 
a 
world-wide 
equalization 
of 
incomes 
nor 
of 
an 
equalization 
within 
the 
various 
states 
that 
form 
the 
United 
States 
or 
their 
administrative 
subdivisions. 
One 
may 
agree 
or 
disagree 
with 
their 
political 
aims. 
But 
one 
must 
not 
deny 
that 
the 
macroeconomic 
concept 
of 
national 
income 
is 
a 
mere 
political 
slogan 
devoid 
of 
any 
cognitive 
value. 


7. 
Reality 
and 
Play 
The 
natural 
conditions 
of 
their 
existence 
enjoined 
upon 
the 
nonhuman 
ancestors 
of 
man 
the 
necessity 
of 
mercilessly 
fighting 
one 
another 
unto 
death. 
Inwrought 
in 
the 
animal 
character 
of 
man 
is 
the 
impulse 
of 
aggression, 
the 
urge 
to 
annihilate 
all 
those 
who 
compete 
with 
him 
in 
the 
endeavors 
to 
snatch 
a 
sufficient 
share 
of 
the 
scarce 
means 
of 
subsistence 
that 
do 
not 
suffice 
for 
the 
survival 
of 
all 
those 
born. 
Only 
for 
the 
strong 
animal 
was 
there 
a 
chance 
to 
remain 
alive. 


What 
distinguishes 
man 
from 
the 
brutes 
is 
the 
substitution 
of 
social 



cooperation 
for 
mortal 
enmity. 
The 
inborn 
instinct 
of 
aggression 
is 
suppressed 
lest 
it 
disintegrate 
the 
concerted 
effort 
to 
preserve 
life 
and 
to 
make 
it 
more 
satisfactory 
by 
catering 
to 
specifically 
human 
wants. 
To 
calm 
down 
the 
repressed 
but 
not 
fully 
extinguished 
urges 
toward 
violent 
action, 
war 
dances 
and 
games 
were 
resorted 
to. 
What 
was 
once 
bitterly 
serious 
was 
now 
sportingly 
duplicated 
as 
a 
pastime. 
The 
tournament 
looks 
like 
fighting, 
but 
it 
is 
only 
a 
pageant. 
All 
the 
moves 
of 
the 
players 
are 
strictly 
regulated 
by 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
game. 
Victory 
does 
not 
consist 
in 
the 
annihilation 
of 
the 
other 
party, 
but 
in 
the 
attainment 
of 
a 
situation 
that 
the 
rules 
declare 
to 
be 
success. 
Games 
are 
not 
reality, 
but 
merely 
play. 
They 
are 
civilized 
man’s 
outlet 
for 
deeply 
ingrained 
instincts 
of 
enmity. 
When 
the 
game 
comes 
to 
an 
end, 
the 
victors 
and 
the 
defeated 
shake 
hands 
and 
return 
to 
the 
reality 
of 
their 
social 
life, 
which 
is 
cooperation 
and 
not 
fighting. 


One 
could 
hardly 
misinterpret 
more 
fundamentally 
the 
essence 
of 
social 
cooperation 
and 
the 
economic 
effort 
of 
civilized 
mankind 
than 
by 
looking 
upon 
it 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
fight 
or 
the 
playful 
duplication 
of 
fighting, 
a 
game. 
In 
social 
cooperation 
everyone 
in 
serving 
his 
own 
interests 
serves 
the 
interests 
of 
his 
fellow 
men. 
Driven 
by 
the 
urge 
to 
improve 
his 
own 
conditions, 
he 
improves 
the 
conditions 
of 
other 
people. 
The 
baker 
does 
not 
hurt 
those 
for 
whom 
he 
bakes 
bread; 
he 
serves 
them. 
All 
people 
would 
be 
hurt 
if 
the 
baker 
stopped 
producing 
bread 
and 
the 
physician 
no 
longer 
attended 
to 
the 
sick. 
The 
shoemaker 
does 
not 
resort 
to 
“strategy” 
in 
order 
to 
defeat 
his 
customers 
by 
supplying 
them 
with 
shoes. 
Competition 
on 
the 
market 
must 
not 
be 
confused 
with 
the 
pitiless 
biological 
competition 
prevailing 
between 
animals 
and 
plants 
or 
with 
the 
wars 
still 
waged 
between—unfortunately 
not 
yet 
completely—civilized 
nations. 
Catallactic 
competition 
on 
the 
market 
aims 
at 
assigning 
to 
every 
individual 
that 
function 
in 
the 
social 
system 
in 
which 
he 
can 
render 
to 
all 
his 
fellow 
men 
the 
most 
valuable 
of 
the 
services 
he 
is 
able 
to 
perform. 


There 
have 
always 
been 
people 
who 
were 
emotionally 
unfit 
to 
conceive 
the 
fundamental 
principle 
of 
cooperation 
under 
the 
system 
of 
the 
division 
of 
tasks. 
We 
may 
try 
to 
understand 
their 
frailty 
thymologically. 
The 
purchase 
of 
any 
commodity 
curtails 
the 
buyer’s 
power 
to 
acquire 
some 
other 
commodity 
that 
he 
also 
wishes 
to 
get, 
although, 
of 
course, 
he 
considers 
its 
procurement 
as 
less 
important 
than 
that 
of 
the 
good 
he 
actually 
buys. 
From 
this 
point 
of 
view 
he 
looks 
upon 
any 
purchase 
he 
makes 
as 
an 
obstacle 
preventing 
him 
from 
satisfying 
some 
other 
wants. 
If 
he 
did 
not 
buy 
A 
or 
if 
he 
had 
to 
spend 



less 
for 
A, 
he 
would 
have 
been 
able 
to 
acquire 
B. 
There 
is, 
for 
narrow-minded 
people, 
but 
one 
step 
to 
the 
inference 
that 
it 
is 
the 
seller 
of 
A 
who 
forces 
him 
to 
forgo 
B. 
He 
sees 
in 
the 
seller 
not 
the 
man 
who 
makes 
it 
possible 
for 
him 
to 
satisfy 
one 
of 
his 
wants, 
but 
the 
man 
who 
prevents 
him 
from 
satisfying 
some 
other 
wants. 
The 
cold 
weather 
induces 
him 
to 
buy 
fuel 
for 
his 
stove 
and 
curtails 
the 
funds 
he 
can 
spend 
for 
other 
things. 
But 
he 
blames 
neither 
the 
weather 
nor 
his 
longing 
for 
warmth; 
he 
lays 
the 
blame 
on 
the 
dealer 
in 
coal. 
This 
bad 
man, 
he 
thinks, 
profits 
from 
his 
embarrassment. 


Such 
was 
the 
reasoning 
that 
led 
people 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
the 
source 
from 
which 
the 
businessman’s 
profits 
stem 
is 
their 
fellow 
men’s 
need 
and 
suffering. 
According 
to 
this 
reasoning, 
the 
doctor 
makes 
his 
living 
from 
the 
patient’s 
sickness, 
not 
from 
curing 
it. 
Bakeries 
thrive 
on 
hunger, 
not 
because 
they 
provide 
the 
means 
to 
appease 
the 
hunger. 
No 
man 
can 
profit 
but 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
some 
other 
men; 
one 
man’s 
gain 
is 
necessarily 
another 
man’s 
loss. 
In 
an 
act 
of 
exchange 
only 
the 
seller 
gains, 
while 
the 
buyer 
comes 
off 
badly. 
Commerce 
benefits 
the 
sellers 
by 
harming 
the 
buyers. 
The 
advantage 
of 
foreign 
trade, 
says 
the 
Mercantilist 
doctrine, 
old 
and 
new, 
consists 
in 
exporting, 
not 
in 
the 
imports 
purchased 
by 
the 
exports.4 


In 
the 
light 
of 
this 
fallacy 
the 
businessman’s 
concern 
is 
to 
hurt 
the 
public. 
His 
skill 
is 
strategy, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 
art 
of 
inflicting 
as 
much 
evil 
as 
possible 
on 
the 
enemy. 
The 
adversaries 
whose 
ruin 
he 
plots 
are 
his 
prospective 
customers 
as 
well 
as 
his 
competitors, 
those 
who 
like 
himself 
embark 
upon 
raids 
against 
the 
people. 
The 
most 
appropriate 
method 
to 
investigate 
scientifically 
business 
activities 
and 
the 
market 
process 
is 
to 
analyze 
the 
behavior 
and 
strategy 
of 
people 
engaged 
in 
games.5 


In 
a 
game 
there 
is 
a 
definite 
prize 
that 
falls 
to 
the 
victor. 
If 
the 
prize 
has 
been 
provided 
by 
a 
third 
party, 
the 
defeated 
party 
goes 
away 
empty-handed. 
If 
the 
prize 
is 
formed 
by 
contributions 
of 
the 
players, 
the 
defeated 
forfeit 
their 
stake 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
victorious 
party. 
In 
a 
game 
there 
are 
winners 
and 
losers. 
But 
a 
business 
deal 
is 
always 
advantageous 
for 
both 
parties. 
If 
both 
the 
buyer 
and 
the 
seller 
were 
not 
to 
consider 
the 
transaction 
as 
the 
most 
advantageous 
action 
they 
could 
choose 
under 
the 
prevailing 
conditions, 
they 
would 
not 
enter 
into 
the 
deal.6 


It 
is 
true 
that 
business 
as 
well 
as 
playing 
a 
game 
is 
rational 
behavior. 
But 
so 
are 
all 
other 
actions 
of 
man. 
The 
scientist 
in 
his 
investigations, 
the 
murderer 
in 
plotting 
his 
crime, 
the 
office-seeker 
in 
canvassing 
for 
votes, 
the 
judge 
in 
search 
of 
a 
just 
decision, 
the 
missionary 
in 
his 
attempts 
to 
convert 
a 



nonbeliever, 
the 
teacher 
instructing 
his 
pupils, 
all 
proceed 
rationally. 


A 
game 
is 
a 
pastime, 
is 
a 
means 
to 
employ 
one’s 
leisure 
time 
and 
to 
banish 
boredom. 
It 
involves 
costs 
and 
belongs 
to 
the 
sphere 
of 
consumption. 
But 
business 
is 
a 
means—the 
only 
means—to 
increase 
the 
quantity 
of 
goods 
available 
for 
preserving 
life 
and 
rendering 
it 
more 
agreeable. 
No 
game 
can, 
apart 
from 
the 
pleasure 
it 
gives 
to 
the 
players 
and 
to 
the 
spectators, 
contribute 
anything 
to 
the 
improvement 
of 
human 
conditions.7 
It 
is 
a 
mistake 
to 
equate 
games 
with 
the 
achievements 
of 
business 
activity. 


Man’s 
striving 
after 
an 
improvement 
of 
the 
conditions 
of 
his 
existence 
impels 
him 
to 
action. 
Action 
requires 
planning 
and 
the 
decision 
which 
of 
various 
plans 
is 
the 
most 
advantageous. 
But 
the 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
business 
is 
not 
that 
it 
enjoins 
upon 
man 
decision-making 
as 
such, 
but 
that 
it 
aims 
at 
improving 
the 
conditions 
of 
life. 
Games 
are 
merriment, 
sport, 
and 
fun; 
business 
is 
life 
and 
reality. 


8. 
Misinterpretation 
of 
the 
Climate 
of 
Opinion 
One 
does 
not 
explain 
a 
doctrine 
and 
actions 
engendered 
by 
it 
if 
one 
declares 
that 
it 
was 
generated 
by 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
age 
or 
by 
the 
personal 
or 
geographical 
environment 
of 
the 
actors. 
In 
resorting 
to 
such 
interpretations 
one 
merely 
stresses 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
definite 
idea 
was 
in 
agreement 
with 
other 
ideas 
held 
at 
the 
same 
time 
and 
in 
the 
same 
milieu 
by 
other 
people. 
What 
is 
called 
the 
spirit 
of 
an 
age, 
of 
the 
members 
of 
a 
collective, 
or 
of 
a 
certain 
milieu 
is 
precisely 
the 
doctrines 
prevailing 
among 
the 
individuals 
concerned. 


The 
ideas 
that 
change 
the 
intellectual 
climate 
of 
a 
given 
environment 
are 
those 
unheard 
of 
before. 
For 
these 
new 
ideas 
there 
is 
no 
other 
explanation 
than 
that 
there 
was 
a 
man 
from 
whose 
mind 
they 
originated. 


A 
new 
idea 
is 
an 
answer 
provided 
by 
its 
author 
to 
the 
challenge 
of 
natural 
conditions 
or 
of 
ideas 
developed 
before 
by 
other 
people. 
Looking 
backward 
upon 
the 
history 
of 
ideas—and 
the 
actions 
engendered 
by 
them— 
the 
historian 
may 
discover 
a 
definite 
trend 
in 
their 
succession 
and 
may 
say 
that 
“logically” 
the 
earlier 
idea 
made 
the 
emergence 
of 
the 
later 
idea 
due. 
However 
such 
hindsight 
philosophy 
lacks 
any 
rational 
justification. 
Its 
tendency 
to 
belittle 
the 
contributions 
of 
the 
genius—the 
hero 
of 
intellectual 
history—and 
to 
ascribe 
his 
work 
to 
the 
juncture 
of 
events 
makes 
sense 
only 
in 
the 
frame 
of 
a 
philosophy 
of 
history 
that 
pretends 
to 
know 
the 
hidden 
plan 
that 
God 
or 
a 
superhuman 
power 
(such 
as 
the 
material 
productive 
forces 
in 



the 
system 
of 
Marx) 
wants 
to 
accomplish 
by 
directing 
the 
actions 
of 
all 
men. 
From 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
such 
a 
philosophy 
all 
men 
are 
puppets 
bound 
to 
behave 
exactly 
in 
the 
ways 
the 
demiurge 
has 
assigned 
to 
them. 


9. 
The 
Belief 
in 
the 
Omnipotence 
of 
Thought 
A 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
present-day 
popular 
ideas 
concerning 
social 
cooperation 
is 
what 
Freud 
has 
called 
the 
belief 
in 
the 
omnipotence 
of 
human 
thought 
(die 
Allmacht 
des 
Gedankens).8 
This 
belief 
is, 
of 
course, 
(apart 
from 
psychopaths 
and 
neurotics) 
not 
maintained 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
sphere 
that 
is 
investigated 
by 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
But 
in 
the 
field 
of 
social 
events 
it 
is 
firmly 
established. 
It 
developed 
out 
of 
the 
doctrine 
that 
ascribes 
infallibility 
to 
majorities. 


The 
essential 
point 
in 
the 
political 
doctrines 
of 
the 
Enlightenment 
was 
the 
substitution 
of 
representative 
government 
for 
royal 
despotism. 
In 
the 
constitutional 
conflict 
in 
Spain 
in 
which 
champions 
of 
parliamentary 
government 
were 
fighting 
against 
the 
absolutist 
aspirations 
of 
the 
Bourbon 
Ferdinand 
VII, 
the 
supporters 
of 
a 
constitutional 
regime 
were 
called 
Liberals 
and 
those 
of 
the 
King 
Serviles. 
Very 
soon 
the 
name 
Liberalism 
was 
adopted 
all 
over 
Europe. 


Representative 
or 
parliamentary 
government 
(also 
called 
government 
by 
the 
people 
or 
democratic 
government) 
is 
government 
by 
officeholders 
designated 
by 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
people. 
Demagogues 
tried 
to 
justify 
it 
by 
ecstatic 
babble 
about 
the 
supernatural 
inspiration 
of 
majorities. 
However, 
it 
is 
a 
serious 
mistake 
to 
assume 
that 
the 
nineteenth-century 
liberals 
of 
Europe 
and 
America 
advocated 
it 
because 
they 
believed 
in 
the 
infallible 
wisdom, 
moral 
perfection, 
inherent 
justice, 
and 
other 
virtues 
of 
the 
common 
man 
and 
therefore 
of 
majorities. 
The 
liberals 
wanted 
to 
safeguard 
the 
smooth 
evolution 
of 
all 
peoples’ 
prosperity 
and 
material 
as 
well 
as 
spiritual 
well-being. 
They 
wanted 
to 
do 
away 
with 
poverty 
and 
destitution. 
As 
a 
means 
to 
attain 
these 
ends 
they 
advocated 
institutions 
that 
would 
make 
for 
peaceful 
cooperation 
of 
all 
citizens 
within 
the 
various 
nations 
as 
well 
as 
for 
international 
peace. 
They 
looked 
upon 
wars, 
whether 
civil 
wars 
(revolutions) 
or 
foreign 
wars, 
as 
a 
disturbance 
of 
the 
steady 
progress 
of 
mankind 
to 
more 
satisfactory 
conditions. 
They 
realized 
very 
well 
that 
the 
market 
economy, 
the 
very 
basis 
of 
modern 
civilization, 
involves 
peaceful 
cooperation 
and 
bursts 
asunder 
when 
people, 
instead 
of 
exchanging 
commodities 
and 
services, 
are 
fighting 



one 
another. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
liberals 
understood 
very 
well 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
might 
of 
the 
rulers 
ultimately 
rests, 
not 
upon 
material 
force, 
but 
upon 
ideas. 
As 
David 
Hume 
has 
pointed 
out 
in 
his 
famous 
essay 
On 
the 
First 
Principles 
of 
Government, 
the 
rulers 
are 
always 
a 
minority 
of 
people. 
Their 
authority 
and 
power 
to 
command 
obedience 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
immense 
majority 
of 
those 
subject 
to 
them 
are 
derived 
from 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
latter 
that 
they 
best 
serve 
their 
own 
interests 
by 
loyalty 
to 
their 
chiefs 
and 
compliance 
with 
their 
orders. 
If 
this 
opinion 
dwindles, 
the 
majority 
will 
sooner 
or 
later 
rise 
in 
rebellion. 
Revolution—civil 
war—will 
remove 
the 
unpopular 
system 
of 
government 
and 
the 
unpopular 
rulers 
and 
replace 
them 
by 
a 
system 
and 
by 
officeholders 
whom 
the 
majority 
consider 
as 
more 
favorable 
to 
the 
promotion 
of 
their 
own 
concerns. 
To 
avoid 
such 
violent 
disturbances 
of 
the 
peace 
and 
their 
pernicious 
consequences, 
to 
safeguard 
the 
peaceful 
operation 
of 
the 
economic 
system, 
the 
liberals 
advocate 
government 
by 
the 
representatives 
of 
the 
majority. 
This 
scheme 
makes 
peaceful 
change 
in 
the 
arrangement 
of 
public 
affairs 
possible. 
It 
makes 
recourse 
to 
arms 
and 
bloodshed 
unnecessary 
not 
only 
in 
domestic 
but 
no 
less 
in 
international 
relations. 
When 
every 
territory 
can 
by 
majority 
vote 
determine 
whether 
it 
should 
form 
an 
independent 
state 
or 
a 
part 
of 
a 
larger 
state, 
there 
will 
no 
longer 
be 
wars 
to 
conquer 
more 
provinces.9 


In 
advocating 
rule 
by 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
people, 
the 
nineteenth-century 
liberals 
did 
not 
nurture 
any 
illusions 
about 
the 
intellectual 
and 
moral 
perfection 
of 
the 
many, 
of 
the 
majorities. 
They 
knew 
that 
all 
men 
are 
liable 
to 
error 
and 
that 
it 
could 
happen 
that 
the 
majority, 
deluded 
by 
faulty 
doctrines 
propagated 
by 
irresponsible 
demagogues, 
could 
embark 
upon 
policies 
that 
would 
result 
in 
disaster, 
even 
in 
the 
entire 
destruction 
of 
civilization. 
But 
they 
were 
no 
less 
aware 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
no 
thinkable 
method 
of 
government 
could 
prevent 
such 
a 
catastrophe. 
If 
the 
small 
minority 
of 
enlightened 
citizens 
who 
are 
able 
to 
conceive 
sound 
principles 
of 
political 
management 
do 
not 
succeed 
in 
winning 
the 
support 
of 
their 
fellow 
citizens 
and 
converting 
them 
to 
the 
endorsement 
of 
policies 
that 
bring 
and 
preserve 
prosperity, 
the 
cause 
of 
mankind 
and 
civilization 
is 
hopeless. 
There 
is 
no 
other 
means 
to 
safeguard 
a 
propitious 
development 
of 
human 
affairs 
than 
to 
make 
the 
masses 
of 
inferior 
people 
adopt 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 
elite. 
This 
has 
to 
be 
achieved 
by 
convincing 
them. 
It 
cannot 
be 
accomplished 
by 
a 
despotic 
regime 
that 
instead 
of 
enlightening 
the 
masses 
beats 
them 
into 
submission. 
In 
the 
long 
run 
the 
ideas 



of 
the 
majority, 
however 
detrimental 
they 
may 
be, 
will 
carry 
on. 
The 
future 
of 
mankind 
depends 
on 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
elite 
to 
influence 
public 
opinion 
in 
the 
right 
direction. 


These 
liberals 
did 
not 
believe 
in 
the 
infallibility 
of 
any 
human 
being 
nor 
in 
the 
infallibility 
of 
majorities. 
Their 
optimism 
concerning 
the 
future 
was 
based 
upon 
the 
expectation 
that 
the 
intellectual 
elite 
will 
persuade 
the 
majority 
to 
approve 
of 
beneficial 
policies. 


The 
history 
of 
the 
last 
hundred 
years 
has 
not 
fulfilled 
these 
hopes. 
Perhaps 
the 
transition 
from 
the 
despotism 
of 
kings 
and 
aristocracies 
came 
too 
suddenly. 
At 
any 
rate, 
it 
is 
a 
fact 
that 
the 
doctrine 
that 
ascribes 
intellectual 
and 
moral 
excellence 
to 
the 
common 
man 
and 
consequently 
infallibility 
to 
the 
majority 
became 
the 
fundamental 
dogma 
of 
“progressive” 
political 
propaganda. 
In 
its 
farther 
logical 
development 
it 
generated 
the 
belief 
that 
in 
the 
field 
of 
society’s 
political 
and 
economic 
organization 
any 
scheme 
devised 
by 
the 
majority 
can 
work 
satisfactorily. 
People 
no 
longer 
ask 
whether 
interventionism 
or 
socialism 
can 
bring 
about 
the 
effects 
that 
their 
advocates 
are 
expecting 
from 
them. 
The 
mere 
fact 
that 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
voters 
ask 
for 
them 
is 
considered 
as 
an 
irrefutable 
proof 
that 
they 
can 
work 
and 
will 
inevitably 
result 
in 
the 
benefits 
expected. 
No 
politician 
is 
any 
longer 
interested 
in 
the 
question 
whether 
a 
measure 
is 
fit 
to 
produce 
the 
ends 
aimed 
at. 
What 
alone 
counts 
for 
him 
is 
whether 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
voters 
favor 
or 
reject 
it.10 
Only 
very 
few 
people 
pay 
attention 
to 
what 
“mere 
theory” 
says 
about 
socialism 
and 
to 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
socialist 
“experiments” 
in 
Russia 
and 
in 
other 
countries. 
Almost 
all 
our 
contemporaries 
firmly 
believe 
that 
socialism 
will 
transform 
the 
earth 
into 
a 
paradise. 
One 
may 
call 
it 
wishful 
thinking 
or 
the 
belief 
in 
the 
omnipotence 
of 
thought. 


Yet 
the 
criterion 
of 
truth 
is 
that 
it 
works 
even 
if 
nobody 
is 
prepared 
to 
acknowledge 
it. 


10. 
The 
Concept 
of 
a 
Perfect 
System 
of 
Government 
The 
“social 
engineer” 
is 
the 
reformer 
who 
is 
prepared 
to 
“liquidate” 
all 
those 
who 
do 
not 
fit 
into 
his 
plan 
for 
the 
arrangement 
of 
human 
affairs. 
Yet 
historians 
and 
sometimes 
even 
victims 
whom 
he 
puts 
to 
death 
are 
not 
averse 
to 
finding 
some 
extenuating 
circumstances 
for 
his 
massacres 
or 
planned 
massacres 
by 
pointing 
out 
that 
he 
was 
ultimately 
motivated 
by 
a 
noble 
ambition: 
he 
wanted 
to 
establish 
the 
perfect 
state 
of 
mankind. 
They 
assign 
to 



him 
a 
place 
in 
the 
long 
line 
of 
the 
designers 
of 
Utopian 
schemes. 


Now 
it 
is 
certainly 
folly 
to 
excuse 
in 
this 
way 
the 
mass 
murders 
of 
such 
sadistic 
gangsters 
as 
Stalin 
and 
Hitler. 
But 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
many 
of 
the 
most 
bloody 
“liquidators” 
were 
guided 
by 
the 
ideas 
that 
inspired 
from 
time 
immemorial 
the 
attempts 
of 
philosophers 
to 
meditate 
on 
a 
perfect 
constitution. 
Having 
once 
hatched 
out 
the 
design 
of 
such 
an 
ideal 
order, 
the 
author 
is 
in 
search 
of 
the 
man 
who 
would 
establish 
it 
by 
suppressing 
the 
opposition 
of 
all 
those 
who 
disagree. 
In 
this 
vein, 
Plato 
was 
anxious 
to 
find 
a 
tyrant 
who 
would 
use 
his 
power 
for 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
Platonic 
ideal 
state. 
The 
question 
whether 
other 
people 
would 
like 
or 
dislike 
what 
he 
himself 
had 
in 
store 
for 
them 
never 
occurred 
to 
Plato. 
It 
was 
an 
understood 
thing 
for 
him 
that 
the 
king 
who 
turned 
philosopher 
or 
the 
philosopher 
who 
became 
king 
was 
alone 
entitled 
to 
act 
and 
that 
all 
other 
people 
had, 
without 
a 
will 
of 
their 
own, 
to 
submit 
to 
his 
orders. 
Seen 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
philosopher 
who 
is 
firmly 
convinced 
of 
his 
own 
infallibility, 
all 
dissenters 
appear 
merely 
as 
stubborn 
rebels 
resisting 
what 
will 
benefit 
them. 


The 
experience 
provided 
by 
history, 
especially 
by 
that 
of 
the 
last 
two 
hundred 
years, 
has 
not 
shaken 
this 
belief 
in 
salvation 
by 
tyranny 
and 
the 
liquidation 
of 
dissenters. 
Many 
of 
our 
contemporaries 
are 
firmly 
convinced 
that 
what 
is 
needed 
to 
render 
all 
human 
affairs 
perfectly 
satisfactory 
is 
brutal 
suppression 
of 
all 
“bad” 
people, 
i.e., 
of 
those 
with 
whom 
they 
disagree. 
They 
dream 
of 
a 
perfect 
system 
of 
government 
that—as 
they 
think—would 
have 
already 
long 
since 
been 
realized 
if 
these 
“bad” 
men, 
guided 
by 
stupidity 
and 
selfishness, 
had 
not 
hindered 
its 
establishment. 


A 
modern, 
allegedly 
scientific 
school 
of 
reformers 
rejects 
these 
violent 
measures 
and 
puts 
the 
blame 
for 
all 
that 
is 
found 
wanting 
in 
human 
conditions 
upon 
the 
alleged 
failure 
of 
what 
is 
called 
“political 
science.” 
The 
natural 
sciences, 
they 
say, 
have 
advanced 
considerably 
in 
the 
last 
centuries, 
and 
technology 
provides 
us 
almost 
monthly 
with 
new 
instruments 
that 
render 
life 
more 
agreeable. 
But 
“political 
progress 
has 
been 
nil.” 
The 
reason 
is 
that 
“political 
science 
stood 
still.”11 
Political 
science 
ought 
to 
adopt 
the 
methods 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences; 
it 
should 
no 
longer 
waste 
its 
time 
in 
mere 
speculations, 
but 
should 
study 
the 
“facts.” 
For, 
as 
in 
the 
natural 
sciences, 
the 
“facts 
are 
needed 
before 
the 
theory.” 
12 


One 
can 
hardly 
misconstrue 
more 
lamentably 
every 
aspect 
of 
human 
conditions. 
Restricting 
our 
criticism 
to 
the 
epistemological 
problems 
involved, 
we 
have 
to 
say: 
What 
is 
today 
called 
“political 
science” 
is 
that 



branch 
of 
history 
that 
deals 
with 
the 
history 
of 
political 
institutions 
and 
with 
the 
history 
of 
political 
thought 
as 
manifested 
in 
the 
writings 
of 
authors 
who 
disserted 
about 
political 
institutions 
and 
sketched 
plans 
for 
their 
alteration. 
It 
is 
history, 
and 
can 
as 
such, 
as 
has 
been 
pointed 
out 
above, 
never 
provide 
any 
“facts” 
in 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
this 
term 
is 
used 
in 
the 
experimental 
natural 
sciences. 
There 
is 
no 
need 
to 
urge 
the 
political 
scientists 
to 
assemble 
all 
facts 
from 
the 
remote 
past 
and 
from 
recent 
history, 
falsely 
labelled 
“present 
experience.”13 
Actually 
they 
do 
all 
that 
can 
be 
done 
in 
this 
regard. 
And 
it 
is 
nonsensical 
to 
tell 
them 
that 
conclusions 
derived 
from 
this 
material 
ought 
“to 
be 
tested 
by 
experiments.”14 
It 
is 
supererogatory 
to 
repeat 
that 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
cannot 
make 
any 
experiments. 


It 
would 
be 
preposterous 
to 
assert 
apodictically 
that 
science 
will 
never 
succeed 
in 
developing 
a 
praxeological 
aprioristic 
doctrine 
of 
political 
organization 
that 
would 
place 
a 
theoretical 
science 
by 
the 
side 
of 
the 
purely 
historical 
discipline 
of 
political 
science. 
All 
we 
can 
say 
today 
is 
that 
no 
living 
man 
knows 
how 
such 
a 
science 
could 
be 
constructed. 
But 
even 
if 
such 
a 
new 
branch 
of 
praxeology 
were 
to 
emerge 
one 
day, 
it 
would 
be 
of 
no 
use 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
the 
problem 
philosophers 
and 
statesmen 
were 
and 
are 
anxious 
to 
solve. 


That 
every 
human 
action 
has 
to 
be 
judged 
and 
is 
judged 
by 
its 
fruits 
or 
results 
is 
an 
old 
truism. 
It 
is 
a 
principle 
with 
regard 
to 
which 
the 
Gospels 
agree 
with 
the 
often 
badly 
misunderstood 
teachings 
of 
the 
utilitarian 
philosophy. 
But 
the 
crux 
is 
that 
people 
widely 
differ 
from 
one 
another 
in 
their 
appraisal 
of 
the 
results. 
What 
some 
consider 
as 
good 
or 
best 
is 
often 
passionately 
rejected 
by 
others 
as 
entirely 
bad. 
The 
Utopians 
did 
not 
bother 
to 
tell 
us 
what 
arrangement 
of 
affairs 
of 
state 
would 
best 
satisfy 
their 
fellow 
citizens. 
They 
merely 
expounded 
what 
conditions 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
mankind 
would 
be 
most 
satisfactory 
to 
themselves. 
Neither 
to 
them 
nor 
to 
their 
adepts 
who 
tried 
to 
realize 
their 
schemes 
did 
it 
ever 
occur 
that 
there 
is 
a 
fundamental 
difference 
between 
these 
two 
things. 
The 
Soviet 
dictators 
and 
their 
retinue 
think 
that 
all 
is 
good 
in 
Russia 
as 
long 
as 
they 
themselves 
are 
satisfied. 


But 
even 
if 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
argument 
we 
put 
aside 
this 
issue, 
we 
have 
to 
emphasize 
that 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
perfect 
system 
of 
government 
is 
fallacious 
and 
self-contradictory. 


What 
elevates 
man 
above 
all 
other 
animals 
is 
the 
cognition 
that 
peaceful 
cooperation 
under 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
is 
a 
better 
method 
to 
preserve 
life 
and 
to 
remove 
felt 
uneasiness 
than 
indulging 
in 
pitiless 



biological 
competition 
for 
a 
share 
in 
the 
scarce 
means 
of 
subistence 
provided 
by 
nature. 
Guided 
by 
this 
insight, 
man 
alone 
among 
all 
living 
beings 
consciously 
aims 
at 
substituting 
social 
cooperation 
for 
what 
philosophers 
have 
called 
the 
state 
of 
nature 
or 
helium 
omnium 
contra 
omnes 
or 
the 
law 
of 
the 
jungle. 
However, 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
peace, 
it 
is, 
as 
human 
beings 
are, 
indispensable 
to 
be 
ready 
to 
repel 
by 
violence 
any 
aggression, 
be 
it 
on 
the 
part 
of 
domestic 
gangsters 
or 
on 
the 
part 
of 
external 
foes. 
Thus, 
peaceful 
human 
cooperation, 
the 
prerequisite 
of 
prosperity 
and 
civilization, 
cannot 
exist 
without 
a 
social 
apparatus 
of 
coercion 
and 
compulsion, 
i.e., 
without 
a 
government. 
The 
evils 
of 
violence, 
robbery, 
and 
murder 
can 
be 
prevented 
only 
by 
an 
institution 
that 
itself, 
whenever 
needed, 
resorts 
to 
the 
very 
methods 
of 
acting 
for 
the 
prevention 
of 
which 
it 
is 
established. 
There 
emerges 
a 
distinction 
between 
illegal 
employment 
of 
violence 
and 
the 
legitimate 
recourse 
to 
it. 
In 
cognizance 
of 
this 
fact 
some 
people 
have 
called 
government 
an 
evil, 
although 
admitting 
that 
it 
is 
a 
necessary 
evil. 
However, 
what 
is 
required 
to 
attain 
an 
end 
sought 
and 
considered 
as 
beneficial 
is 
not 
an 
evil 
in 
the 
moral 
connotation 
of 
this 
term, 
but 
a 
means, 
the 
price 
to 
be 
paid 
for 
it. 
Yet 
the 
fact 
remains 
that 
actions 
that 
are 
deemed 
highly 
objectionable 
and 
criminal 
when 
perpetrated 
by 
“unauthorized” 
individuals 
are 
approved 
when 
committed 
by 
the 
“authorities.” 


Government 
as 
such 
is 
not 
only 
not 
an 
evil, 
but 
the 
most 
necessary 
and 
beneficial 
institution, 
as 
without 
it 
no 
lasting 
social 
cooperation 
and 
no 
civilization 
could 
be 
developed 
and 
preserved. 
It 
is 
a 
means 
to 
cope 
with 
an 
inherent 
imperfection 
of 
many, 
perhaps 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
all 
people. 
If 
all 
men 
were 
able 
to 
realize 
that 
the 
alternative 
to 
peaceful 
social 
cooperation 
is 
the 
renunciation 
of 
all 
that 
distinguishes 
Homo 
sapiens 
from 
the 
beasts 
of 
prey, 
and 
if 
all 
had 
the 
moral 
strength 
always 
to 
act 
accordingly, 
there 
would 
not 
be 
any 
need 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
social 
apparatus 
of 
coercion 
and 
oppression. 
Not 
the 
state 
is 
an 
evil, 
but 
the 
shortcomings 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
and 
character 
that 
imperatively 
require 
the 
operation 
of 
a 
police 
power. 
Government 
and 
state 
can 
never 
be 
perfect 
because 
they 
owe 
their 
raison 
d’être 
to 
the 
imperfection 
of 
man 
and 
can 
attain 
their 
end, 
the 
elimination 
of 
man’s 
innate 
impulse 
to 
violence, 
only 
by 
recourse 
to 
violence, 
the 
very 
thing 
they 
are 
called 
upon 
to 
prevent. 


It 
is 
a 
double-edged 
makeshift 
to 
entrust 
an 
individual 
or 
a 
group 
of 
individuals 
with 
the 
authority 
to 
resort 
to 
violence. 
The 
enticement 
implied 
is 
too 
tempting 
for 
a 
human 
being. 
The 
men 
who 
are 
to 
protect 
the 
community 



against 
violent 
aggression 
easily 
turn 
into 
the 
most 
dangerous 
aggressors. 
They 
transgress 
their 
mandate. 
They 
misuse 
their 
power 
for 
the 
oppression 
of 
those 
whom 
they 
were 
expected 
to 
defend 
against 
oppression. 
The 
main 
political 
problem 
is 
how 
to 
prevent 
the 
police 
power 
from 
becoming 
tyrannical. 
This 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
all 
the 
struggles 
for 
liberty. 
The 
essential 
characteristic 
of 
Western 
civilization 
that 
distinguishes 
it 
from 
the 
arrested 
and 
petrified 
civilizations 
of 
the 
East 
was 
and 
is 
its 
concern 
for 
freedom 
from 
the 
state. 
The 
history 
of 
the 
West, 
from 
the 
age 
of 
the 
Greek 
πόλις 
down 
to 
the 
present-day 
resistance 
to 
socialism, 
is 
essentially 
the 
history 
of 
the 
fight 
for 
liberty 
against 
the 
encroachments 
of 
the 
officeholders. 


A 
shallow-minded 
school 
of 
social 
philosophers, 
the 
anarchists, 
chose 
to 
ignore 
the 
matter 
by 
suggesting 
a 
stateless 
organization 
of 
mankind. 
They 
simply 
passed 
over 
the 
fact 
that 
men 
are 
not 
angels. 
They 
were 
too 
dull 
to 
realize 
that 
in 
the 
short 
run 
an 
individual 
or 
a 
group 
of 
individuals 
can 
certainly 
further 
their 
own 
interests 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
their 
own 
and 
all 
other 
peoples’ 
long-run 
interests. 
A 
society 
that 
is 
not 
prepared 
to 
thwart 
the 
attacks 
of 
such 
asocial 
and 
short-sighted 
aggressors 
is 
helpless 
and 
at 
the 
mercy 
of 
its 
least 
intelligent 
and 
most 
brutal 
members. 
While 
Plato 
founded 
his 
Utopia 
on 
the 
hope 
that 
a 
small 
group 
of 
perfectly 
wise 
and 
morally 
impeccable 
philosophers 
will 
be 
available 
for 
the 
supreme 
conduct 
of 
affairs, 
anarchists 
implied 
that 
all 
men 
without 
any 
exception 
will 
be 
endowed 
with 
perfect 
wisdom 
and 
moral 
impeccability. 
They 
failed 
to 
conceive 
that 
no 
system 
of 
social 
cooperation 
can 
remove 
the 
dilemma 
between 
a 
man’s 
or 
a 
group’s 
interests 
in 
the 
short 
run 
and 
those 
in 
the 
long 
run. 


Man’s 
atavistic 
propensity 
to 
beat 
into 
submission 
all 
other 
people 
manifests 
itself 
clearly 
in 
the 
popularity 
enjoyed 
by 
the 
socialist 
scheme. 
Socialism 
is 
totalitarian. 
The 
autocrat 
or 
the 
board 
of 
autocrats 
alone 
is 
called 
upon 
to 
act. 
All 
other 
men 
will 
be 
deprived 
of 
any 
discretion 
to 
choose 
and 
to 
aim 
at 
the 
ends 
chosen; 
opponents 
will 
be 
liquidated. 
In 
approving 
of 
this 
plan, 
every 
socialist 
tacitly 
implies 
that 
the 
dictators, 
those 
entrusted 
with 
production 
management 
and 
all 
government 
functions, 
will 
precisely 
comply 
with 
his 
own 
ideas 
about 
what 
is 
desirable 
and 
what 
undesirable. 
In 
deifying 
the 
state—if 
he 
is 
an 
orthodox 
Marxian, 
he 
calls 
it 
society—and 
in 
assigning 
to 
it 
unlimited 
power, 
he 
deifies 
himself 
and 
aims 
at 
the 
violent 
suppression 
of 
all 
those 
with 
whom 
he 
disagrees. 
The 
socialist 
does 
not 
see 
any 
problem 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
political 
affairs 
because 
he 
cares 
only 
for 
his 
own 
satisfaction 
and 
does 
not 
take 
into 
account 
the 
possibility 
that 
a 
socialist 



government 
would 
proceed 
in 
a 
way 
he 
does 
not 
like. 


The 
“political 
scientists” 
are 
free 
from 
the 
illusions 
and 
self-deception 
that 
mar 
the 
judgment 
of 
anarchists 
and 
socialists. 
But 
busy 
with 
the 
study 
of 
the 
immense 
historical 
material, 
they 
become 
preoccupied 
with 
detail, 
with 
the 
numberless 
instances 
of 
petty 
jealousy, 
envy, 
personal 
ambition, 
and 
covetousness 
displayed 
by 
the 
actors 
on 
the 
political 
scene. 
They 
ascribe 
the 
failure 
of 
all 
political 
systems 
heretofore 
tried 
to 
the 
moral 
and 
intellectual 
weakness 
of 
man. 
As 
they 
see 
it, 
these 
systems 
failed 
because 
their 
satisfactory 
functioning 
would 
have 
required 
men 
of 
moral 
and 
intellectual 
qualities 
only 
exceptionally 
present 
in 
reality. 
Starting 
from 
this 
doctrine, 
they 
tried 
to 
draft 
plans 
for 
a 
political 
order 
that 
could 
function 
automatically, 
as 
it 
were, 
and 
would 
not 
be 
embroiled 
by 
the 
ineptitude 
and 
vices 
of 
men. 
The 
ideal 
constitution 
ought 
to 
safeguard 
a 
blemishless 
conduct 
of 
public 
affairs 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
rulers’ 
and 
the 
people’s 
corruption 
and 
inefficiency. 
Those 
searching 
for 
such 
a 
legal 
system 
did 
not 
indulge 
in 
the 
illusions 
of 
the 
Utopian 
authors 
who 
assumed 
that 
all 
men 
or 
at 
least 
a 
minority 
of 
superior 
men 
are 
blameless 
and 
efficient. 
They 
gloried 
in 
their 
realistic 
approach 
to 
the 
problem. 
But 
they 
never 
raised 
the 
question 
how 
men 
tainted 
by 
all 
the 
shortcomings 
inherent 
in 
the 
human 
character 
could 
be 
induced 
to 
submit 
voluntarily 
to 
an 
order 
that 
would 
prevent 
them 
from 
giving 
vent 
to 
their 
whims 
and 
fancies. 


However, 
the 
main 
deficiency 
of 
this 
allegedly 
realistic 
approach 
to 
the 
problem 
is 
not 
this 
alone. 
It 
is 
to 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
illusion 
that 
government, 
an 
institution 
whose 
essential 
function 
is 
the 
employment 
of 
violence, 
could 
be 
operated 
according 
to 
the 
principles 
of 
morality 
that 
condemn 
peremptorily 
the 
recourse 
to 
violence. 
Government 
is 
beating 
into 
submission, 
imprisoning, 
and 
killing. 
People 
may 
be 
prone 
to 
forget 
it 
because 
the 
law-
abiding 
citizen 
meekly 
submits 
to 
the 
orders 
of 
the 
authorities 
so 
as 
to 
avoid 
punishment. 
But 
the 
jurists 
are 
more 
realistic 
and 
call 
a 
law 
to 
which 
no 
sanction 
is 
attached 
an 
imperfect 
law. 
The 
authority 
of 
man-made 
law 
is 
entirely 
due 
to 
the 
weapons 
of 
the 
constables 
who 
enforce 
obedience 
to 
its 
provisions. 
Nothing 
of 
what 
is 
to 
be 
said 
about 
the 
necessity 
of 
governmental 
action 
and 
the 
benefits 
derived 
from 
it 
can 
remove 
or 
mitigate 
the 
suffering 
of 
those 
who 
are 
languishing 
in 
prisons. 
No 
reform 
can 
render 
perfectly 
satisfactory 
the 
operation 
of 
an 
institution 
the 
essential 
activity 
of 
which 
consists 
in 
inflicting 
pain. 


Responsibility 
for 
the 
failure 
to 
discover 
a 
perfect 
system 
of 
government 



does 
not 
rest 
with 
the 
alleged 
backwardness 
of 
what 
is 
called 
political 
science. 
If 
men 
were 
perfect, 
there 
would 
not 
be 
any 
need 
for 
government. 
With 
imperfect 
men 
no 
system 
of 
government 
could 
function 
satisfactorily. 


The 
eminence 
of 
man 
consists 
in 
his 
power 
to 
choose 
ends 
and 
to 
resort 
to 
means 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
ends 
chosen; 
the 
activities 
of 
government 
aim 
at 
restricting 
this 
discretion 
of 
the 
individuals. 
Every 
man 
aims 
at 
avoiding 
what 
causes 
him 
pain; 
the 
activities 
of 
government 
ultimately 
consist 
in 
the 
infliction 
of 
pain. 
All 
great 
achievements 
of 
mankind 
were 
the 
product 
of 
a 
spontaneous 
effort 
on 
the 
part 
of 
individuals; 
government 
substitutes 
coercion 
for 
voluntary 
action. 
It 
is 
true, 
government 
is 
indispensable 
because 
men 
are 
not 
faultless. 
But 
designed 
to 
cope 
with 
some 
aspects 
of 
human 
imperfection, 
it 
can 
never 
be 
perfect. 


11. 
The 
Behavioral 
Sciences 
The 
self-styled 
behavioral 
sciences 
want 
to 
deal 
scientifically 
with 
human 
behavior.15 
They 
reject 
as 
“unscientific” 
or 
“rationalistic” 
the 
methods 
of 
praxeology 
and 
economics. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
they 
disparage 
history 
as 
tainted 
with 
antiquarianism 
and 
devoid 
of 
any 
practical 
use 
for 
the 
improvement 
of 
human 
conditions. 
Their 
allegedly 
new 
discipline 
will, 
they 
promise, 
deal 
with 
every 
aspect 
of 
man’s 
behavior 
and 
thereby 
provide 
knowledge 
that 
will 
render 
priceless 
services 
to 
the 
endeavors 
to 
improve 
the 
lot 
of 
mankind. 


The 
representatives 
of 
these 
new 
sciences 
are 
not 
prepared 
to 
realize 
that 
they 
are 
historians 
and 
resorting 
to 
the 
methods 
of 
historical 
research.16 
What 
frequently—but 
not 
always—distinguishes 
them 
from 
the 
regular 
historians 
is 
that, 
like 
the 
sociologists, 
they 
choose 
as 
the 
subject 
matter 
of 
their 
investigations 
conditions 
of 
the 
recent 
past 
and 
aspects 
of 
human 
conduct 
that 
most 
historians 
of 
former 
times 
used 
to 
neglect. 
More 
remarkable 
may 
be 
the 
fact 
that 
their 
treatises 
often 
suggest 
a 
definite 
policy, 
as 
allegedly 
“taught” 
by 
history, 
an 
attitude 
which 
most 
of 
the 
sound 
historians 
have 
abandoned 
long 
since. 
It 
is 
not 
our 
concern 
to 
criticize 
the 
methods 
applied 
in 
these 
books 
and 
articles 
nor 
to 
question 
the 
rather 
naive 
political 
prepossessions 
occasionally 
displayed 
by 
their 
authors. 
What 
makes 
it 
advisable 
to 
pay 
attention 
to 
these 
behavioral 
studies 
is 
their 
neglect 
of 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
epistemological 
principles 
of 
history, 
the 
principle 
of 
relevance. 


In 
the 
experimental 
research 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
everything 
that 
can 



be 
observed 
is 
relevant 
enough 
to 
be 
recorded. 
As, 
according 
to 
the 
a 
priori 
that 
is 
at 
the 
outset 
of 
all 
research 
in 
the 
natural 
sciences, 
whatever 
happens 
is 
bound 
to 
happen 
as 
the 
regular 
effect 
of 
what 
preceded 
it, 
every 
correctly 
observed 
and 
described 
event 
is 
a 
“fact” 
that 
has 
to 
be 
integrated 
into 
the 
theoretical 
body 
of 
doctrine. 
No 
account 
of 
an 
experience 
is 
without 
some 
bearing 
on 
the 
whole 
of 
knowledge. 
Consequently, 
every 
research 
project, 
if 
conscientiously 
and 
skillfully 
performed, 
is 
to 
be 
considered 
as 
a 
contribution 
to 
mankind’s 
scientific 
effort. 


In 
the 
historical 
sciences 
it 
is 
different. 
They 
deal 
with 
human 
actions: 
the 
value 
judgments 
that 
incited 
them, 
the 
serviceableness 
of 
the 
means 
that 
were 
chosen 
for 
their 
performance, 
and 
the 
results 
brought 
about 
by 
them. 
Each 
of 
these 
factors 
plays 
its 
own 
role 
in 
the 
succession 
of 
events. 
It 
is 
the 
main 
task 
of 
the 
historian 
to 
assign 
as 
correctly 
as 
possible 
to 
every 
factor 
the 
range 
of 
its 
effects. 
This 
quasi 
quantification, 
this 
determination 
of 
each 
factor’s 
relevance, 
is 
one 
of 
the 
functions 
that 
the 
specific 
understanding 
of 
the 
historical 
sciences 
is 
called 
upon 
to 
perform.17 


In 
the 
field 
of 
history 
(in 
the 
broadest 
sense 
of 
the 
term) 
there 
prevail 
considerable 
differences 
among 
the 
various 
topics 
that 
could 
be 
made 
the 
subject 
of 
research 
activities. 
It 
is 
insignificant 
and 
meaningless 
to 
determine 
in 
general 
terms 
“the 
behavior 
of 
man” 
as 
the 
program 
of 
a 
discipline’s 
activities. 
Man 
aims 
at 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
different 
goals 
and 
resorts 
to 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
different 
means 
for 
their 
attainment. 
The 
historian 
(or, 
for 
that 
matter, 
the 
behavioral 
scientist) 
must 
choose 
a 
subject 
of 
relevance 
for 
the 
fate 
of 
mankind 
and 
therefore 
also 
for 
the 
enlargement 
of 
our 
knowledge. 
He 
must 
not 
waste 
his 
time 
in 
trifles. 
In 
choosing 
the 
theme 
of 
his 
book 
he 
classifies 
himself. 
One 
man 
writes 
the 
history 
of 
liberty, 
another 
man 
the 
history 
of 
a 
card 
game. 
One 
man 
writes 
the 
biography 
of 
Dante, 
another 
the 
biography 
of 
a 
fashionable 
hotel’s 
headwaiter.18 


As 
the 
great 
subjects 
of 
mankind’s 
past 
have 
already 
been 
dealt 
with 
by 
the 
traditional 
historical 
sciences, 
what 
is 
left 
to 
the 
behavioral 
sciences 
is 
detailed 
studies 
about 
the 
pleasures, 
sorrows, 
and 
crimes 
of 
the 
common 
man. 
To 
collect 
recent 
material 
about 
these 
and 
similar 
matters 
no 
special 
knowledge 
or 
technique 
is 
required. 
Every 
college 
boy 
can 
immediately 
embark 
upon 
some 
project. 
There 
is 
an 
unlimited 
number 
of 
subjects 
for 
doctoral 
dissertations 
and 
more 
sizable 
treatises. 
Many 
of 
them 
deal 
with 
quite 
trivial 
themes, 
devoid 
of 
any 
value 
for 
the 
enrichment 
of 
our 
knowledge. 



These 
so-called 
behavioral 
sciences 
badly 
need 
a 
thorough 
reorientation 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
relevance 
principle. 
It 
is 
possible 
to 
write 
a 
voluminous 
book 
about 
every 
subject. 
But 
the 
question 
is 
whether 
such 
a 
book 
deals 
with 
something 
that 
counts 
as 
relevant 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
theory 
or 
of 
practice. 



6 


Further 
Implications 
of 
the 
Neglect 
of 
Economic 
Thinking 


1. 
The 
Zoological 
Approach 
to 
Human 
Problems 
Naturalism 
plans 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
problems 
of 
human 
action 
in 
the 
way 
zoology 
deals 
with 
all 
other 
living 
beings. 
Behaviorism 
wants 
to 
obliterate 
what 
distinguishes 
human 
action 
from 
the 
behavior 
of 
animals. 
In 
these 
schemes 
there 
is 
no 
room 
left 
for 
the 
specific 
human 
quality, 
man’s 
distinctive 
feature, 
viz., 
the 
conscious 
striving 
after 
ends 
chosen. 
They 
ignore 
the 
human 
mind. 
The 
concept 
of 
finality 
is 
foreign 
to 
them. 


Zoologically 
seen, 
man 
is 
an 
animal. 
But 
there 
prevails 
a 
fundamental 
difference 
between 
the 
conditions 
of 
all 
other 
animals 
and 
those 
of 
man. 
Every 
living 
being 
is 
naturally 
the 
implacable 
enemy 
of 
every 
other 
living 
being, 
especially 
of 
all 
other 
members 
of 
his 
own 
species. 
For 
the 
means 
of 
subsistence 
are 
scarce. 
They 
do 
not 
permit 
all 
specimens 
to 
survive 
and 
to 
consummate 
their 
existence 
up 
to 
the 
point 
at 
which 
their 
inborn 
vitality 
is 
fully 
spent. 
This 
irreconcilable 
conflict 
of 
essential 
interests 
prevails 
first 
of 
all 
among 
the 
members 
of 
the 
same 
species 
because 
they 
depend 
for 
their 
survival 
on 
the 
same 
foodstuffs. 
Nature 
is 
literally 
“red 
in 
tooth 
and 
claw.” 
1 


Man 
too 
is 
an 
animal. 
But 
he 
differs 
from 
all 
other 
animals 
as, 
by 
dint 
of 
his 
reason, 
he 
has 
discovered 
the 
great 
cosmic 
law 
of 
the 
higher 
productivity 
of 
cooperation 
under 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor. 
Man 
is, 
as 
Aristotle 
formulated 
it, 
the 
, 
the 
social 
animal, 
but 
he 
is 
“social” 
not 
on 
account 
of 
his 
animal 
nature, 
but 
on 
account 
of 
his 
specifically 
human 
quality. 
Specimens 
of 
his 
own 
zoological 
species 
are, 
for 



the 
human 
individual, 
not 
deadly 
enemies 
opposed 
to 
him 
in 
pitiless 
biological 
competition, 
but 
cooperators 
or 
potential 
cooperators 
in 
joint 
efforts 
to 
improve 
the 
external 
condition 
of 
his 
own 
welfare. 
An 
unbridgeable 
gulf 
separates 
man 
from 
all 
those 
beings 
that 
lack 
the 
ability 
to 
grasp 
the 
meaning 
of 
social 
cooperation. 


2. 
The 
Approach 
of 
the 
“Social 
Sciences” 
It 
is 
customary 
to 
hypostatize 
social 
cooperation 
by 
employing 
the 
term 
“society.” 
Some 
mysterious 
superhuman 
agency, 
it 
is 
said, 
created 
society 
and 
peremptorily 
requires 
man 
to 
sacrifice 
the 
concerns 
of 
his 
petty 
egoism 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
society. 


The 
scientific 
treatment 
of 
the 
problems 
involved 
starts 
with 
the 
radical 
rejection 
of 
this 
mythological 
approach. 
What 
the 
individual 
forgoes 
in 
order 
to 
cooperate 
with 
other 
individuals 
is 
not 
his 
personal 
interests 
opposed 
to 
that 
of 
the 
phantom 
society. 
He 
forsakes 
an 
immediate 
boon 
in 
order 
to 
reap 
at 
a 
later 
date 
a 
greater 
boon. 
His 
sacrifice 
is 
provisional. 
He 
chooses 
between 
his 
interests 
in 
the 
short 
run 
and 
his 
interests 
in 
the 
long 
run, 
those 
which 
the 
classical 
economists 
used 
to 
call 
his 
“rightly 
understood” 
interests. 


The 
utilitarian 
philosophy 
does 
not 
look 
upon 
the 
rules 
of 
morality 
as 
upon 
arbitrary 
laws 
imposed 
upon 
man 
by 
a 
tyrannical 
Deity 
with 
which 
man 
has 
to 
comply 
without 
asking 
any 
further 
questions. 
To 
behave 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
rules 
that 
are 
required 
for 
the 
preservation 
of 
social 
cooperation 
is 
for 
man 
the 
only 
means 
to 
attain 
safely 
all 
those 
ends 
that 
he 
wants 
to 
attain. 


The 
attempts 
to 
reject 
this 
rationalistic 
interpretation 
of 
morality 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
Christian 
teachings 
are 
futile. 
According 
to 
the 
fundamental 
doctrine 
of 
Christian 
theology 
and 
philosophy, 
God 
has 
created 
the 
human 
mind 
in 
endowing 
man 
with 
his 
faculty 
of 
thinking. 
As 
both 
revelation 
and 
human 
reason 
are 
manifestations 
of 
the 
Lord’s 
might, 
there 
cannot 
be 
ultimately 
any 
disagreement 
between 
them. 
God 
does 
not 
contradict 
himself. 
It 
is 
the 
object 
of 
philosophy 
and 
theology 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
concord 
between 
revelation 
and 
reason. 
Such 
was 
the 
problem 
the 
solution 
of 
which 
patristic 
and 
scholastic 
philosophy 
tried 
to 
achieve.2 
Most 
of 
these 
thinkers 
doubted 
whether 
the 
human 
mind, 
unaided 
by 
revelation, 
would 
have 
been 
able 
to 
become 
aware 
of 
what 
the 
dogmas, 
especially 
those 
of 
the 
Incarnation 
and 
of 
the 
Trinity, 
taught. 
But 
they 
did 
not 
express 
serious 
doubts 
concerning 
the 
faculty 
of 
human 
reason 
in 
all 
other 
regards. 



The 
popular 
attacks 
upon 
the 
social 
philosophy 
of 
the 
Enlightenment 
and 
the 
utilitarian 
doctrine 
as 
taught 
by 
the 
classical 
economists 
did 
not 
originate 
from 
Christian 
theology, 
but 
from 
theistic, 
atheistic, 
and 
antitheistic 
reasoning. 
They 
take 
for 
granted 
the 
existence 
of 
some 
collectives 
and 
ask 
neither 
how 
such 
collectives 
came 
into 
existence 
nor 
in 
what 
sense 
they 
“exist.” 
They 
ascribe 
to 
the 
collective 
of 
their 
choice—mankind 
(humanité), 
race, 
nation 
(in 
the 
sense 
attached 
to 
this 
term 
in 
English 
and 
in 
French, 
which 
corresponds 
to 
the 
German 
Staat) 
nationality 
(the 
totality 
of 
all 
people 
speaking 
the 
same 
language), 
social 
class 
(in 
the 
Marxian 
sense), 
and 
some 
others—all 
the 
attributes 
of 
acting 
individuals. 
They 
maintain 
that 
the 
reality 
of 
these 
collectives 
can 
be 
perceived 
directly 
and 
that 
they 
exist 
apart 
from 
and 
above 
the 
actions 
of 
the 
individuals 
who 
belong 
to 
them. 
They 
assume 
that 
the 
moral 
law 
obliges 
the 
individual 
to 
subordinate 
his 
“petty” 
private 
desires 
and 
interests 
to 
those 
of 
the 
collective 
to 
which 
he 
belongs 
“by 
rights” 
and 
to 
which 
he 
owes 
unconditional 
allegiance. 
The 
individual 
who 
pursues 
his 
own 
interests 
or 
prefers 
loyalty 
to 
a 
“counterfeit” 
collective 
to 
that 
of 
the 
“true” 
collective 
is 
just 
a 
refractory. 


The 
main 
characteristic 
of 
collectivism 
is 
that 
it 
does 
not 
take 
notice 
of 
the 
individual’s 
will 
and 
moral 
self-determination. 
In 
the 
light 
of 
its 
philosophy 
the 
individual 
is 
born 
into 
a 
collective 
and 
it 
is 
“natural” 
and 
proper 
for 
him 
to 
behave 
as 
members 
of 
this 
collective 
are 
expected 
to 
behave. 
Expected 
by 
whom? 


Of 
course, 
by 
those 
individuals 
to 
whom, 
by 
the 
mysterious 
decrees 
of 
some 
mysterious 
agency, 
the 
task 
of 
determining 
the 
collective 
will 
and 
directing 
the 
actions 
of 
the 
collective 
has 
been 
entrusted. 


In 
the 
ancien 
régime 
authoritarianism 
was 
based 
upon 
a 
kind 
of 
theocratic 
doctrine. 
The 
anointed 
king 
ruled 
by 
the 
grace 
of 
God; 
his 
mandate 
was 
from 
God. 
He 
was 
the 
personification 
of 
the 
realm. 
“France” 
was 
the 
name 
both 
of 
the 
king 
and 
of 
the 
country; 
the 
king’s 
children 
were 
enfants 
de 
France. 
Subjects 
who 
defied 
the 
royal 
orders 
were 
rebels. 


The 
social 
philosophy 
of 
the 
Enlightenment 
rejected 
this 
presumption. 
It 
called 
all 
Frenchmen 
enfants 
de 
la 
patrie, 
children 
of 
the 
fatherland. 
No 
longer 
was 
compulsory 
unanimity 
in 
all 
essential 
and 
political 
matters 
to 
be 
enforced. 
The 
institution 
of 
representative 
government—government 
by 
the 
people—acknowledges 
the 
fact 
that 
people 
may 
disagree 
with 
regard 
to 
political 
issues 
and 
that 
those 
sharing 
the 
same 
opinions 
consort 
with 
one 
another 
in 
parties. 
The 
party 
in 
office 
rules 
as 
long 
as 
it 
is 
supported 
by 
the 



majority. 


The 
neoauthoritarianism 
of 
collectivism 
stigmatizes 
this 
“relativism” 
as 
contrary 
to 
human 
nature. 
The 
collective 
is 
seen 
as 
an 
entity 
above 
the 
concerns 
of 
the 
individuals. 
It 
is 
immaterial 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
individuals 
spontaneously 
agree 
with 
the 
concerns 
of 
the 
whole. 
At 
any 
rate 
it 
is 
their 
duty 
to 
agree. 
There 
are 
no 
parties; 
there 
is 
only 
the 
collective.3 
All 
the 
people 
are 
morally 
bound 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
collective’s 
orders. 
If 
they 
disobey, 
they 
are 
forced 
to 
yield. 
This 
is 
what 
the 
Russian 
Marshal 
Zhukov 
called 
the 
“idealistic 
system” 
as 
opposed 
to 
the 
“materialistic 
system” 
of 
Western 
individualism 
that 
the 
commanding 
general 
of 
the 
American 
forces 
found 
“a 
little 
difficult” 
to 
defend.4 


The 
“social 
sciences” 
are 
committed 
to 
the 
propagation 
of 
the 
collectivistic 
doctrine. 
They 
do 
not 
waste 
any 
words 
on 
the 
hopeless 
task 
of 
denying 
the 
existence 
of 
individuals 
or 
proving 
their 
villainy. 
In 
defining 
as 
the 
objective 
of 
the 
social 
sciences 
concern 
with 
“the 
activities 
of 
the 
individual 
as 
a 
member 
of 
a 
group”5 
and 
implying 
that 
the 
social 
sciences 
so 
defined 
cover 
everything 
that 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
natural 
sciences, 
they 
simply 
ignore 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
individual. 
In 
their 
view, 
the 
existence 
of 
groups 
or 
collectives 
is 
an 
ultimate 
given. 
They 
do 
not 
attempt 
to 
search 
for 
the 
factors 
that 
make 
individuals 
cooperate 
with 
one 
another 
and 
thus 
create 
what 
is 
called 
groups 
or 
collectives. 
For 
them 
the 
collective, 
like 
life 
or 
mind, 
is 
a 
primary 
phenomenon 
the 
origin 
of 
which 
science 
cannot 
trace 
back 
to 
the 
operation 
of 
some 
other 
phenomenon. 
Consequently, 
the 
social 
sciences 
are 
at 
a 
loss 
to 
explain 
how 
it 
can 
happen 
that 
there 
exists 
a 
multitude 
of 
collectives 
and 
that 
the 
same 
individuals 
are 
at 
the 
same 
time 
members 
of 
different 
collectives. 


3. 
The 
Approach 
of 
Economics 
Economics 
or 
catallactics, 
the 
only 
branch 
of 
the 
theoretical 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
that 
has 
up 
to 
now 
been 
elaborated, 
views 
the 
collectives 
as 
creations 
of 
the 
cooperation 
of 
individuals. 
Guided 
by 
the 
idea 
that 
definite 
ends 
sought 
can 
be 
attained 
either 
better 
or 
only 
by 
cooperation, 
men 
associate 
with 
one 
another 
in 
cooperation 
and 
thus 
bring 
forth 
what 
is 
called 
groups 
or 
collectives 
or 
simply 
human 
society. 


The 
paragon 
of 
collectivization 
or 
socialization 
is 
the 
market 
economy, 
and 
the 
fundamental 
principle 
of 
collective 
action 
is 
the 
mutual 
exchange 
of 



services, 
the 
do 
ut 
des. 
The 
individual 
gives 
and 
serves 
in 
order 
to 
be 
rewarded 
by 
his 
fellow 
men’s 
gifts 
and 
services. 
He 
gives 
away 
what 
he 
values 
less 
in 
order 
to 
receive 
something 
that 
at 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
transaction 
he 
considers 
as 
more 
desirable. 
He 
exchanges—buys 
or 
sells—because 
he 
thinks 
that 
this 
is 
the 
most 
advantageous 
thing 
he 
can 
do 
at 
the 
time. 


The 
intellectual 
comprehension 
of 
what 
individuals 
do 
in 
exchanging 
commodities 
and 
services 
has 
been 
obscured 
by 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
social 
sciences 
have 
distorted 
the 
meaning 
of 
all 
the 
terms 
concerned. 
In 
their 
jargon 
“society” 
does 
not 
mean 
the 
result 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
substitution 
of 
mutual 
cooperation 
among 
individuals 
for 
the 
isolated 
efforts 
of 
individuals 
to 
improve 
their 
conditions; 
it 
signifies 
a 
mythical 
collective 
entity 
in 
whose 
name 
a 
group 
of 
governors 
is 
expected 
to 
take 
care 
of 
all 
their 
fellow 
men. 
They 
employ 
the 
adjective 
“social” 
and 
the 
noun 
“socialization” 
accordingly. 


Social 
cooperation 
among 
individuals—society—can 
be 
based 
either 
upon 
spontaneous 
coordination 
or 
upon 
command 
and 
subordination; 
in 
the 
terminology 
of 
Henry 
Sumner 
Maine, 
either 
upon 
contract 
or 
upon 
status. 
Into 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
contract 
society 
the 
individual 
integrates 
himself 
spontaneously; 
in 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
status 
society 
his 
place 
and 
functions— 
his 
duties—are 
assigned 
to 
him 
by 
those 
in 
command 
of 
the 
social 
apparatus 
of 
compulsion 
and 
oppression. 
While 
in 
the 
contract 
society 
this 
apparatus— 
the 
government 
or 
the 
state—interferes 
only 
in 
order 
to 
quell 
violent 
or 
fraudulent 
machinations 
to 
subvert 
the 
system 
of 
mutual 
exchange 
of 
services, 
in 
the 
status 
society 
it 
keeps 
the 
whole 
system 
going 
by 
orders 
and 
prohibitions. 


The 
market 
economy 
was 
not 
devised 
by 
a 
master 
mind; 
it 
was 
not 
first 
planned 
as 
an 
Utopian 
scheme 
and 
then 
put 
to 
work. 
Spontaneous 
actions 
of 
individuals, 
aiming 
at 
nothing 
else 
than 
at 
the 
improvement 
of 
their 
own 
state 
of 
satisfaction, 
undermined 
the 
prestige 
of 
the 
coercive 
status 
system 
step 
by 
step. 
Then 
only, 
when 
the 
superior 
efficiency 
of 
economic 
freedom 
could 
no 
longer 
be 
questioned, 
social 
philosophy 
entered 
the 
scene 
and 
demolished 
the 
ideology 
of 
the 
status 
system. 
The 
political 
supremacy 
of 
the 
supporters 
of 
the 
precapitalistic 
order 
was 
annulled 
by 
civil 
wars. 
The 
market 
economy 
itself 
was 
not 
a 
product 
of 
violent 
action—of 
revolutions—but 
of 
a 
series 
of 
gradual 
peaceful 
changes. 
The 
implications 
of 
the 
term 
“industrial 
revolution” 
are 
utterly 
misleading. 


4. 
A 
Remark 
about 
Legal 
Terminology 

In 
the 
political 
sphere 
the 
violent 
overthrow 
of 
the 
precapitalistic 
methods 
of 
government 
resulted 
in 
the 
complete 
abandonment 
of 
the 
feudal 
concepts 
of 
public 
law 
and 
the 
development 
of 
a 
new 
constitutional 
doctrine 
with 
legal 
concepts 
and 
terms 
unknown 
before. 
(Only 
in 
England, 
where 
the 
transformation 
of 
the 
system 
of 
royal 
supremacy 
first 
into 
that 
of 
the 
supremacy 
of 
a 
caste 
of 
privileged 
landowners 
and 
then 
into 
that 
of 
representative 
government 
with 
adult 
franchise 
was 
effected 
by 
a 
succession 
of 
peaceful 
changes,6 
was 
the 
terminology 
of 
the 
ancien 
régime 
for 
the 
most 
part 
preserved 
while 
its 
original 
meaning 
had 
long 
since 
become 
devoid 
of 
any 
practical 
applicability.) 
In 
the 
sphere 
of 
civil 
law 
the 
transition 
from 
precapitalistic 
to 
capitalistic 
conditions 
was 
brought 
about 
by 
a 
long 
series 
of 
small 
changes 
through 
the 
actions 
of 
people 
who 
lacked 
the 
power 
to 
alter 
formally 
the 
traditional 
legal 
institutions 
and 
concepts. 
The 
new 
methods 
of 
doing 
business 
generated 
new 
branches 
of 
law 
that 
were 
developed 
out 
of 
older 
business 
customs 
and 
practices. 
But 
however 
radically 
these 
new 
methods 
transformed 
the 
essence 
and 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
traditional 
legal 
institutions, 
it 
was 
assumed 
that 
those 
terms 
and 
concepts 
of 
the 
old 
law 
that 
remained 
in 
use 
continued 
to 
signify 
the 
same 
social 
and 
economic 
conditions 
they 
had 
signified 
in 
ages 
gone 
by. 
The 
retention 
of 
the 
traditional 
terms 
prevents 
superficial 
observers 
from 
noticing 
the 
full 
significance 
of 
the 
fundamental 
changes 
effected. 
The 
outstanding 
example 
is 
provided 
by 
the 
use 
of 
the 
concept 
of 
property. 


Where 
there 
by 
and 
large 
prevails 
economic 
self-sufficiency 
of 
every 
household, 
and 
consequently 
there 
is 
for 
the 
much 
greater 
part 
of 
all 
products 
no 
regular 
exchange, 
the 
meaning 
of 
property 
in 
producers’ 
goods 
does 
not 
differ 
from 
the 
meaning 
of 
property 
in 
consumers’ 
goods. 
In 
each 
case 
property 
serves 
the 
owner 
exclusively. 
To 
own 
something, 
whether 
a 
producers’ 
good 
or 
a 
consumers’ 
good, 
means 
to 
have 
it 
for 
oneself 
alone 
and 
to 
deal 
with 
it 
for 
one’s 
own 
satisfaction. 


But 
it 
is 
quite 
a 
different 
thing 
in 
the 
frame 
of 
a 
market 
economy. 
The 
owner 
of 
producers’ 
goods 
is 
forced 
to 
employ 
them 
for 
the 
best 
possible 
satisfaction 
of 
the 
wants 
of 
the 
consumers. 
He 
forfeits 
his 
property 
if 
other 
people 
eclipse 
him 
by 
better 
serving 
the 
consumers. 
In 
the 
market 
economy 
property 
is 
acquired 
and 
preserved 
by 
serving 
the 
public 
and 
is 
lost 
when 
the 
public 
becomes 
dissatisfied 
with 
the 
way 
in 
which 
it 
is 
served. 
Private 
property 
in 
the 
factors 
of 
production 
is 
a 
public 
mandate, 
as 
it 
were, 
which 
is 
withdrawn 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
consumers 
think 
that 
other 
people 
would 
employ 
it 



more 
efficiently. 
By 
the 
instrumentality 
of 
the 
profit-and-loss 
system, 
the 
owners 
are 
forced 
to 
deal 
with 
“their” 
property 
as 
if 
it 
were 
other 
peoples’ 
property 
entrusted 
to 
them 
under 
the 
obligation 
to 
utilize 
it 
for 
the 
best 
possible 
satisfaction 
of 
the 
virtual 
beneficiaries, 
the 
consumers. 
All 
factors 
of 
production, 
including 
also 
the 
human 
factor, 
viz., 
labor, 
serve 
the 
totality 
of 
the 
members 
of 
the 
market 
economy. 
Such 
is 
the 
real 
meaning 
and 
character 
of 
private 
property 
in 
the 
material 
factors 
of 
production 
under 
capitalism. 
It 
could 
be 
ignored 
and 
misinterpreted 
only 
because 
people—economists 
and 
lawyers 
as 
well 
as 
laymen—had 
been 
led 
astray 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
legal 
concept 
of 
property 
as 
developed 
by 
the 
juridical 
practices 
and 
doctrines 
of 
precapitalistic 
ages 
has 
been 
retained 
unchanged 
or 
only 
slightly 
altered 
after 
its 
effective 
meaning 
had 
been 
radically 
altered.7 


It 
is 
necessary 
to 
deal 
with 
this 
issue 
in 
an 
analysis 
of 
the 
epistemological 
problems 
of 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
because 
it 
shows 
how 
radically 
the 
approach 
of 
modern 
praxeology 
differs 
from 
that 
of 
the 
traditional 
older 
ways 
of 
studying 
social 
conditions. 
Blinded 
by 
the 
uncritical 
acceptance 
of 
the 
legalistic 
doctrines 
of 
precapitalistic 
ages, 
generations 
of 
authors 
entirely 
failed 
to 
see 
the 
characteristic 
features 
of 
the 
market 
economy 
and 
of 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
within 
the 
market 
economy. 
In 
their 
view, 
the 
capitalists 
and 
entrepreneurs 
appear 
as 
irresponsible 
autocrats 
administering 
economic 
affairs 
for 
their 
own 
benefit 
without 
any 
regard 
for 
the 
concerns 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
people. 
They 
depict 
profit 
as 
unfair 
lucre 
derived 
from 
the 
“exploitation” 
of 
the 
employees 
and 
the 
consumers. 
Their 
passionate 
denunciation 
of 
profit 
prevented 
them 
from 
realizing 
that 
it 
is 
precisely 
the 
necessity 
to 
make 
profits 
and 
to 
avoid 
losses 
that 
forces 
the 
“exploiters” 
to 
satisfy 
the 
consumers 
to 
the 
best 
of 
their 
abilities 
by 
supplying 
them 
with 
those 
commodities 
and 
services 
they 
are 
most 
urgently 
asking 
for. 
The 
consumers 
are 
sovereign 
because 
they 
ultimately 
determine 
what 
has 
to 
be 
produced, 
in 
what 
quantity, 
and 
of 
what 
quality. 


5. 
The 
Sovereignty 
of 
the 
Consumers 
One 
of 
the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
market 
economy 
is 
the 
specific 
way 
in 
which 
it 
deals 
with 
the 
problems 
offered 
by 
the 
biological, 
moral, 
and 
intellectual 
inequality 
of 
men. 


In 
the 
precapitalistic 
ages 
the 
superior, 
i.e., 
the 
smarter 
and 
more 



efficient 
individuals, 
subdued 
and 
enthralled 
the 
masses 
of 
their 
less 
efficient 
fellows. 
In 
the 
status 
society 
there 
are 
castes; 
there 
are 
lords 
and 
there 
are 
servants. 
All 
affairs 
are 
managed 
for 
the 
sole 
benefit 
of 
the 
former, 
while 
the 
latter 
have 
to 
drudge 
for 
their 
masters. 


In 
the 
market 
economy 
the 
better 
people 
are 
forced 
by 
the 
instrumentality 
of 
the 
profit-and-loss 
system 
to 
serve 
the 
concerns 
of 
everybody, 
including 
the 
hosts 
of 
inferior 
people. 
In 
its 
frame 
the 
most 
desirable 
situations 
can 
be 
attained 
only 
by 
actions 
that 
benefit 
all 
the 
people. 
The 
masses, 
in 
their 
capacity 
as 
consumers, 
ultimately 
determine 
everybody’s 
revenues 
and 
wealth. 
They 
entrust 
control 
of 
the 
capital 
goods 
to 
those 
who 
know 
how 
to 
employ 
them 
for 
their 
own, 
i.e., 
the 
masses’, 
best 
satisfaction. 


It 
is, 
of 
course, 
true 
that 
in 
the 
market 
economy 
not 
those 
fare 
best 
who, 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
an 
enlightened 
judgment, 
ought 
to 
be 
considered 
as 
the 
most 
eminent 
individuals 
of 
the 
human 
species. 
The 
uncouth 
hordes 
of 
common 
men 
are 
not 
fit 
to 
recognize 
duly 
the 
merits 
of 
those 
who 
eclipse 
their 
own 
wretchedness. 
They 
judge 
everybody 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
their 
desires. 
Thus, 
boxing 
champions 
and 
authors 
of 
detective 
stories 
enjoy 
a 
higher 
prestige 
and 
earn 
more 
money 
than 
philosophers 
and 
poets. 
Those 
who 
bemoan 
this 
fact 
are 
certainly 
right. 
But 
no 
social 
system 
could 
be 
devised 
that 
would 
fairly 
reward 
the 
contributions 
of 
the 
innovator 
whose 
genius 
leads 
mankind 
to 
ideas 
unknown 
before 
and 
therefore 
first 
rejected 
by 
all 
those 
who 
lack 
the 
same 
inspiration. 


What 
the 
so-called 
democracy 
of 
the 
market 
brings 
about 
is 
a 
state 
of 
affairs 
in 
which 
production 
activities 
are 
operated 
by 
those 
of 
whose 
conduct 
of 
affairs 
the 
masses 
approve 
by 
buying 
their 
products. 
By 
rendering 
their 
enterprises 
profitable, 
the 
consumers 
shift 
control 
of 
the 
factors 
of 
production 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
those 
businessmen 
who 
serve 
them 
best. 
By 
rendering 
the 
enterprises 
of 
the 
bungling 
entrepreneurs 
unprofitable, 
they 
withdraw 
control 
from 
those 
entrepreneurs 
with 
whose 
services 
they 
disagree. 
It 
is 
antisocial 
in 
the 
strict 
meaning 
of 
the 
term 
if 
governments 
thwart 
these 
decisions 
of 
the 
people 
by 
taxing 
profits. 
From 
a 
genuinely 
social 
point 
of 
view, 
it 
would 
be 
more 
“social” 
to 
tax 
losses 
than 
to 
tax 
profits. 


The 
inferiority 
of 
the 
multitude 
manifests 
itself 
most 
convincingly 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
loathe 
the 
capitalistic 
system 
and 
stigmatize 
the 
profits 
that 
their 
own 
behavior 
creates 
as 
unfair. 
The 
demand 
to 
expropriate 
all 
private 
property 
and 
to 
redistribute 
it 
equally 
among 
all 
members 
of 
society 
made 
sense 
in 
a 
thoroughly 
agricultural 
society. 
There 
the 
fact 
that 
some 
people 



owned 
large 
estates 
was 
the 
corollary 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
others 
owned 
nothing 
or 
not 
enough 
to 
support 
them 
and 
their 
families. 
But 
it 
is 
different 
in 
a 
society 
in 
which 
the 
standard 
of 
living 
depends 
on 
the 
supply 
of 
capital 
goods. 
Capital 
is 
accumulated 
by 
thrift 
and 
saving 
and 
is 
maintained 
by 
abstention 
from 
decumulating 
and 
dissipating 
it. 
The 
wealth 
of 
the 
well-to-do 
of 
an 
industrial 
society 
is 
both 
the 
cause 
and 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
masses’ 
well-being. 
Also 
those 
who 
do 
not 
own 
it 
are 
enriched, 
not 
impoverished, 
by 
it. 


The 
spectacle 
offered 
by 
the 
policies 
of 
contemporary 
governments 
is 
paradoxical 
indeed. 
The 
much 
defamed 
acquisitiveness 
of 
promoters 
and 
speculators 
succeeds 
daily 
in 
providing 
the 
masses 
with 
commodities 
and 
services 
unknown 
before. 
A 
horn 
of 
plenty 
is 
poured 
upon 
people 
for 
whom 
the 
methods 
by 
means 
of 
which 
all 
these 
marvelous 
gadgets 
are 
produced 
are 
incomprehensible. 
These 
dull 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
capitalistic 
system 
indulge 
in 
the 
delusion 
that 
it 
is 
their 
own 
performance 
of 
routine 
jobs 
that 
creates 
all 
these 
marvels. 
They 
cast 
their 
votes 
for 
rulers 
who 
are 
committed 
to 
a 
policy 
of 
sabotage 
and 
destruction. 
They 
look 
upon 
“big 
business,” 
necessarily 
committed 
to 
catering 
to 
mass 
consumption, 
as 
upon 
the 
foremost 
public 
enemy 
and 
approve 
of 
every 
measure 
that, 
as 
they 
think, 
improves 
their 
own 
conditions 
by 
“punishing” 
those 
whom 
they 
envy. 


To 
analyze 
the 
problems 
involved 
is, 
of 
course, 
not 
the 
task 
of 
epistemology. 



7 


The 
Epistemological 
Roots 
of 
Monism 


1. 
The 
Nonexperimental 
Character 
of 
Monism 
Man’s 
world 
view 
is, 
as 
has 
been 
pointed 
out, 
deterministic. 
Man 
cannot 
conceive 
the 
idea 
of 
an 
absolute 
nothing 
or 
of 
something 
originating 
out 
of 
nothing 
and 
invading 
the 
universe 
from 
without. 
The 
human 
concept 
of 
the 
universe 
comprehends 
everything 
that 
exists. 
The 
human 
concept 
of 
time 
knows 
neither 
of 
any 
beginning 
nor 
of 
any 
end 
of 
the 
flux 
of 
time. 
All 
that 
is 
and 
will 
be 
was 
potentially 
present 
in 
something 
that 
was 
already 
existing 
before. 
What 
happens 
was 
bound 
to 
happen. 
The 
full 
interpretation 
of 
every 
event 
leads 
to 
a 
regressns 
in 
infinitum. 


This 
unbroken 
determinism, 
which 
is 
the 
epistemological 
starting 
point 
of 
all 
that 
the 
experimental 
natural 
sciences 
do 
and 
teach, 
is 
not 
derived 
from 
experience; 
it 
is 
a 
priori.1 
Logical 
positivists 
realize 
the 
aprioristic 
character 
of 
determinism 
and, 
faithful 
to 
their 
dogmatic 
empiricism, 
passionately 
reject 
determinism. 
But 
they 
are 
not 
aware 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
is 
no 
logical 
or 
empirical 
basis 
whatever 
for 
the 
essential 
dogma 
of 
their 
creed, 
their 
monistic 
interpretation 
of 
all 
phenomena. 
What 
the 
empiricism 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
shows 
is 
a 
dualism 
of 
two 
spheres 
about 
the 
mutual 
relations 
of 
which 
we 
know 
very 
little. 
There 
is, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
the 
orbit 
of 
external 
events 
about 
which 
our 
senses 
convey 
information 
to 
us, 
and 
there 
is, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
orbit 
of 
invisible 
and 
intangible 
thoughts 
and 
ideas. 
If 
we 
not 
only 
assume 
that 
the 
faculty 
to 
develop 
what 
is 
called 
mind 
was 
already 
potentially 
inwrought 
in 
the 
original 
structure 
of 
things 
that 
existed 
from 
eternity 
on 
and 



was 
brought 
to 
fruition 
by 
the 
succession 
of 
events 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
these 
things 
necessarily 
produced, 
but 
also 
that 
in 
this 
process 
there 
was 
nothing 
that 
could 
not 
be 
reduced 
to 
physical 
and 
chemical 
events, 
we 
are 
resorting 
to 
deduction 
from 
an 
arbitrary 
theorem. 
There 
is 
no 
experience 
that 
could 
either 
support 
or 
refute 
such 
a 
doctrine. 


All 
that 
the 
experimental 
natural 
sciences 
up 
to 
now 
have 
taught 
us 
about 
the 
mind-body 
problem 
is 
that 
there 
prevails 
some 
connection 
between 
a 
man’s 
faculty 
of 
thinking 
and 
acting 
and 
the 
conditions 
of 
his 
body. 
We 
know 
that 
injuries 
to 
the 
brain 
can 
seriously 
impair 
or 
even 
entirely 
destroy 
man’s 
mental 
abilities 
and 
that 
death, 
the 
total 
disintegration 
of 
the 
physiological 
functions 
of 
the 
living 
tissues, 
invariably 
blots 
out 
those 
activities 
of 
the 
mind 
that 
can 
be 
noticed 
by 
other 
peoples’ 
minds. 
But 
we 
know 
nothing 
about 
the 
process 
that 
produces 
within 
the 
body 
of 
a 
living 
man 
thoughts 
and 
ideas. 
Almost 
identical 
external 
events 
that 
impinge 
on 
the 
human 
mind 
result 
with 
different 
people 
and 
with 
the 
same 
people 
at 
different 
moments 
in 
different 
thoughts 
and 
ideas. 
Physiology 
does 
not 
have 
any 
method 
that 
could 
adequately 
deal 
with 
the 
phenomena 
of 
the 
mind’s 
reaction 
to 
stimuli. 
The 
natural 
sciences 
are 
unable 
to 
employ 
their 
methods 
for 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
meaning 
a 
man 
attaches 
to 
any 
event 
of 
the 
external 
world 
or 
to 
other 
peoples’ 
meaning. 
The 
materialistic 
philosophy 
of 
La 
Mettrie 
and 
Feuerbach 
and 
the 
monism 
of 
Haeckel 
are 
not 
natural 
science; 
they 
are 
metaphysical 
doctrines 
aiming 
at 
an 
explanation 
of 
something 
that 
the 
natural 
sciences 
could 
not 
explore. 
So 
are 
the 
monistic 
doctrines 
of 
positivism 
and 
neopositivism. 


In 
establishing 
these 
facts 
one 
does 
not 
intend 
to 
ridicule 
the 
doctrines 
of 
materialistic 
monism 
and 
to 
qualify 
them 
as 
nonsense. 
Only 
the 
positivists 
consider 
all 
metaphysical 
speculations 
as 
nonsense 
and 
reject 
any 
kind 
of 
apriorism. 
Judicious 
philosophers 
and 
scientists 
have 
admitted 
without 
any 
reservation 
that 
the 
natural 
sciences 
have 
not 
contributed 
anything 
that 
could 
justify 
the 
tenets 
of 
positivism 
and 
materialism 
and 
that 
all 
these 
schools 
of 
thought 
are 
teaching 
is 
metaphysics, 
and 
a 
very 
unsatisfactory 
brand 
of 
metaphysics. 


The 
doctrines 
that 
claim 
for 
themselves 
the 
epithet 
of 
radical 
or 
pure 
empiricism 
and 
stigmatize 
all 
that 
is 
not 
experimental 
natural 
science 
as 
nonsense 
fail 
to 
realize 
that 
the 
allegedly 
empiricist 
nucleus 
of 
their 
philosophy 
is 
entirely 
based 
upon 
deduction 
from 
an 
unwarranted 
premise. 
All 
that 
the 
natural 
sciences 
can 
do 
is 
to 
trace 
back 
all 
the 
phenomena 
that 



can 
be—directly 
or 
indirectly—perceived 
by 
the 
human 
senses 
to 
an 
array 
of 
ultimately 
given 
data. 
One 
may 
reject 
a 
dualistic 
or 
pluralistic 
interpretation 
of 
experience 
and 
assume 
that 
all 
these 
ultimate 
data 
might 
in 
the 
future 
development 
of 
scientific 
knowledge 
be 
traced 
back 
to 
a 
common 
source. 
But 
such 
an 
assumption 
is 
not 
experimental 
natural 
science. 
It 
is 
a 
metaphysical 
interpretation. 
And 
so 
is 
the 
further 
assumption 
that 
this 
source 
will 
also 
appear 
as 
the 
root 
out 
of 
which 
all 
mental 
phenomena 
evolved. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
all 
the 
attempts 
of 
philosophers 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
supreme 
being 
by 
mundane 
methods 
of 
thinking, 
either 
by 
aprioristic 
reasoning 
or 
drawing 
inferences 
from 
certain 
observed 
qualities 
of 
visible 
and 
tangible 
phenomena, 
have 
led 
to 
an 
impasse. 
But 
we 
have 
to 
realize 
that 
it 
is 
no 
less 
impossible 
to 
demonstrate 
logically 
by 
the 
same 
philosophical 
methods 
the 
nonexistence 
of 
God 
or 
to 
reject 
the 
thesis 
that 
God 
created 
the 
X 
from 
which 
everything 
the 
natural 
sciences 
deal 
with 
is 
derived 
and 
the 
further 
thesis 
that 
the 
inexplicable 
powers 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
came 
and 
come 
into 
being 
by 
reiterated 
divine 
intervention 
in 
the 
affairs 
of 
the 
universe. 
The 
Christian 
doctrine 
according 
to 
which 
God 
creates 
the 
soul 
of 
every 
individual 
cannot 
be 
refuted 
by 
discursive 
reasoning 
as 
it 
cannot 
be 
proved 
in 
this 
way. 
There 
is 
neither 
in 
the 
brilliant 
achievements 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
nor 
in 
aprioristic 
reasoning 
anything 
that 
could 
contradict 
Du 
Bois-Reymond’s 
Ignorabimus. 


There 
cannot 
be 
such 
a 
thing 
as 
scientific 
philosophy 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
logical 
positivism 
and 
empiricism 
ascribe 
to 
the 
adjective 
“scientific.” 
The 
human 
mind 
in 
its 
search 
for 
knowledge 
resorts 
to 
philosophy 
or 
theology 
precisely 
because 
it 
aims 
at 
an 
explanation 
of 
problems 
that 
the 
natural 
sciences 
cannot 
answer. 


Philosophy 
deals 
with 
things 
beyond 
the 
limits 
that 
the 
logical 
structure 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
enables 
man 
to 
infer 
from 
the 
exploits 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences. 


2. 
The 
Historical 
Setting 
of 
Positivism 
One 
does 
not 
satisfactorily 
characterize 
the 
problems 
of 
human 
action 
if 
one 
says 
that 
the 
natural 
sciences 
have—up 
to 
now, 
at 
least—failed 
to 
provide 
anything 
for 
their 
elucidation. 
A 
correct 
description 
of 
the 
situation 
would 
have 
to 
stress 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
natural 
sciences 
do 
not 
even 
have 
the 
mental 
tools 
to 
become 
aware 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
such 
problems. 
Ideas 
and 



final 
causes 
are 
categories 
for 
which 
there 
is 
no 
room 
left 
in 
the 
system 
and 
in 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
Their 
terminology 
lacks 
all 
the 
concepts 
and 
words 
that 
could 
provide 
an 
adequate 
orientation 
in 
the 
orbit 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
of 
action. 
And 
all 
their 
achievements, 
however 
marvelous 
and 
beneficial 
they 
are, 
do 
not 
even 
superficially 
touch 
the 
essential 
problems 
of 
philosophy 
with 
which 
metaphysical 
and 
religious 
doctrines 
try 
to 
cope. 


The 
development 
of 
the 
almost 
generally 
accepted 
opinion 
to 
the 
contrary 
can 
easily 
be 
explained. 
All 
metaphysical 
and 
religious 
doctrines 
contained, 
besides 
their 
theological 
and 
moral 
teachings, 
also 
untenable 
theorems 
about 
natural 
events 
that, 
with 
the 
progressive 
development 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences, 
could 
be 
not 
only 
refuted 
but 
frequently 
even 
ridiculed. 
Theologians 
and 
metaphysicians 
stubbornly 
tried 
to 
defend 
theses, 
only 
superficially 
connected 
with 
the 
core 
of 
their 
moral 
message, 
which 
to 
the 
scientifically 
trained 
mind 
appeared 
as 
most 
absurd 
fables 
and 
myths. 
The 
secular 
power 
of 
the 
churches 
persecuted 
scientists 
who 
had 
the 
courage 
to 
deviate 
from 
such 
teachings. 
The 
history 
of 
science 
in 
the 
orbit 
of 
Western 
Christianity 
is 
a 
history 
of 
conflicts 
in 
which 
the 
doctrines 
of 
science 
were 
always 
better 
founded 
than 
those 
of 
the 
official 
theology. 
Meekly 
the 
theologians 
had 
finally 
in 
every 
controversy 
to 
admit 
that 
their 
adversaries 
were 
right 
and 
that 
they 
themselves 
were 
wrong. 
The 
most 
spectacular 
instance 
of 
such 
an 
inglorious 
defeat—perhaps 
not 
of 
theology 
as 
such, 
but 
certainly 
of 
the 
theologians—was 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
debates 
concerning 
evolution. 


Thus 
originated 
the 
illusion 
that 
all 
the 
issues 
theology 
used 
to 
deal 
with 
could 
be 
one 
day 
fully 
and 
irrefutably 
solved 
by 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
in 
which 
Copernicus 
and 
Galilei 
had 
substituted 
a 
better 
theory 
of 
the 
celestial 
movements 
for 
the 
untenable 
doctrines 
supported 
by 
the 
Church, 
one 
expected 
future 
scientists 
to 
succeed 
in 
replacing 
all 
other 
“superstitious” 
doctrines 
by 
“scientific” 
truth. 
If 
one 
criticizes 
the 
rather 
naive 
epistemology 
and 
philosophy 
of 
Comte, 
Marx, 
and 
Haeckel, 
one 
ought 
not 
to 
forget 
that 
their 
simplism 
was 
the 
reaction 
to 
the 
even 
more 
simplicist 
teachings 
of 
what 
is 
today 
labeled 
Fundamentalism, 
a 
dogmatism 
that 
no 
wise 
theologian 
would 
dare 
to 
adopt 
any 
longer. 


Reference 
to 
these 
facts 
in 
no 
way 
excuses, 
still 
less 
justifies, 
the 
crudities 
of 
contemporary 
positivism. 
It 
merely 
aims 
at 
a 
better 
understanding 
of 
the 
intellectual 
environment 
in 
which 
positivism 
developed 
and 
became 
popular. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
vulgarity 
of 
positivistic 
fanatics 
is 
now 
on 
the 



point 
of 
provoking 
a 
reaction 
that 
may 
seriously 
obstruct 
mankind’s 
intellectual 
future. 
Again, 
as 
in 
the 
late 
Roman 
Empire, 
various 
sects 
of 
idolatry 
are 
flourishing. 
There 
are 
spiritualism, 
voodoo, 
and 
similar 
doctrines 
and 
practices, 
many 
of 
them 
borrowed 
from 
the 
cults 
of 
primitive 
tribes. 
There 
is 
a 
revival 
of 
astrology. 
Our 
age 
is 
not 
only 
an 
age 
of 
science. 
It 
is 
also 
an 
age 
in 
which 
the 
most 
absurd 
superstitions 
are 
finding 
credulous 
adepts. 


3. 
The 
Case 
of 
the 
Natural 
Sciences 
In 
view 
of 
these 
disastrous 
effects 
of 
a 
beginning 
excessive 
reaction 
against 
the 
excrescences 
of 
positivism, 
there 
is 
need 
to 
repeat 
again 
that 
the 
experimental 
methods 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
are 
the 
only 
ones 
adequate 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
the 
problems 
involved. 
Without 
discussing 
anew 
the 
endeavors 
to 
discredit 
the 
category 
of 
causality 
and 
determinism, 
we 
have 
to 
emphasize 
the 
fact 
that 
what 
is 
wrong 
with 
positivism 
is 
not 
what 
it 
teaches 
about 
the 
methods 
of 
the 
empirical 
natural 
sciences, 
but 
what 
it 
asserts 
about 
matters 
concerning 
which—up 
to 
now 
at 
least—the 
natural 
sciences 
have 
not 
succeeded 
in 
contributing 
any 
information. 
The 
positivistic 
principle 
of 
verifiability 
as 
rectified 
by 
Popper2 
is 
unassailable 
as 
an 
epistemological 
principle 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
But 
it 
is 
meaningless 
when 
applied 
to 
anything 
about 
which 
the 
natural 
sciences 
cannot 
supply 
any 
information. 


It 
is 
not 
the 
task 
of 
this 
essay 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
claims 
of 
any 
metaphysical 
doctrine 
or 
with 
metaphysics 
as 
such. 
As 
the 
nature 
and 
logical 
structure 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
is, 
many 
a 
man 
is 
not 
satisfied 
with 
ignorance 
concerning 
any 
problem 
and 
does 
not 
easily 
acquiesce 
in 
the 
agnosticism 
in 
which 
the 
most 
fervent 
search 
for 
knowledge 
results. 
Metaphysics 
and 
theology 
are 
not, 
as 
the 
positivists 
pretend, 
products 
of 
an 
activity 
unworthy 
of 
Homo 
sapiens, 
remnants 
of 
mankind’s 
primitive 
age 
that 
civilized 
people 
ought 
to 
discard. 
They 
are 
a 
manifestation 
of 
man’s 
unappeasable 
craving 
for 
knowledge. 
No 
matter 
whether 
this 
thirsting 
after 
omniscience 
can 
ever 
be 
fully 
gratified 
or 
not, 
man 
will 
not 
cease 
to 
strive 
after 
it 
passionately.3 
Neither 
positivism 
nor 
any 
other 
doctrine 
is 
called 
upon 
to 
condemn 
a 
religious 
or 
metaphysical 
tenet 
that 
does 
not 
contradict 
any 
of 
the 
reliable 
teachings 
of 
the 
a 
priori 
and 
of 
experience. 


4. 
The 
Case 
of 
the 
Sciences 
of 
Human 
Action 

However, 
this 
essay 
does 
not 
deal 
with 
theology 
or 
metaphysics 
and 
the 
rejection 
of 
their 
doctrines 
by 
positivism. 
It 
deals 
with 
positivism’s 
attack 
upon 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action. 


The 
fundamental 
doctrine 
of 
positivism 
is 
the 
thesis 
that 
the 
experimental 
procedures 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
are 
the 
only 
method 
to 
be 
applied 
in 
the 
search 
for 
knowledge. 
As 
the 
positivists 
see 
it, 
the 
natural 
sciences, 
entirely 
absorbed 
by 
the 
more 
urgent 
task 
of 
elucidating 
the 
problems 
of 
physics 
and 
chemistry, 
have 
in 
the 
past 
neglected 
and 
may 
also 
in 
the 
near 
future 
neglect 
to 
pay 
attention 
to 
the 
problems 
of 
human 
action. 
But, 
they 
add, 
there 
cannot 
be 
any 
doubt 
that 
once 
the 
men 
imbued 
with 
a 
scientific 
outlook 
and 
trained 
in 
the 
exact 
methods 
of 
laboratory 
work 
have 
the 
leisure 
to 
turn 
toward 
the 
study 
of 
such 
“minor” 
issues 
as 
human 
behavior, 
they 
will 
substitute 
authentic 
knowledge 
of 
all 
these 
matters 
for 
the 
worthless 
palaver 
that 
is 
now 
in 
vogue. 
“Unified 
science” 
will 
solve 
all 
the 
problems 
involved 
and 
will 
inaugurate 
a 
blissful 
age 
of 
“social 
engineering” 
in 
which 
all 
human 
affairs 
will 
be 
handled 
in 
the 
same 
satisfactory 
way 
in 
which 
modern 
technology 
supplies 
electric 
current. 


Some 
rather 
significant 
steps 
on 
the 
way 
to 
this 
result, 
pretend 
the 
less 
cautious 
harbingers 
of 
this 
creed, 
have 
already 
been 
made 
by 
behaviorism 
(or, 
as 
Neurath 
preferred 
to 
call 
it, 
behavioristics). 
They 
point 
to 
the 
discovery 
of 
tropisms 
and 
to 
that 
of 
conditioned 
reflexes. 
Progressing 
further 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
methods 
that 
brought 
about 
these 
achievements, 
science 
will 
one 
day 
be 
able 
to 
make 
good 
all 
the 
promises 
of 
positivism. 
It 
is 
a 
vain 
conceit 
of 
man 
to 
presume 
that 
his 
conduct 
is 
not 
entirely 
determined 
by 
the 
same 
impulses 
that 
determine 
the 
behavior 
of 
plants 
and 
of 
dogs. 


Against 
all 
this 
impassioned 
talk 
we 
have 
to 
stress 
the 
hard 
fact 
that 
the 
natural 
sciences 
have 
no 
intellectual 
tool 
to 
deal 
with 
ideas 
and 
with 
finality. 


An 
assured 
positivist 
may 
hope 
that 
one 
day 
physiologists 
may 
succeed 
in 
describing 
in 
terms 
of 
physics 
and 
chemistry 
all 
the 
events 
that 
resulted 
in 
the 
production 
of 
definite 
individuals 
and 
in 
modifying 
their 
inborn 
substance 
during 
their 
lives. 
We 
may 
neglect 
raising 
the 
question 
whether 
such 
knowledge 
would 
be 
sufficient 
to 
explain 
fully 
the 
behavior 
of 
animals 
in 
any 
situation 
they 
may 
have 
to 
face. 
But 
it 
cannot 
be 
doubted 
that 
it 
would 
not 
enable 
the 
student 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
way 
in 
which 
a 
man 
reacts 
to 
external 
stimuli. 
For 
this 
human 
reaction 
is 
determined 
by 
ideas, 
a 
phenomenon 
the 
description 
of 
which 
is 
beyond 
the 
reach 
of 
physics, 
chemistry, 
and 
physiology. 
There 
is 
no 
explanation 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
of 
what 



causes 
hosts 
of 
people 
to 
remain 
faithful 
to 
the 
religious 
creed 
in 
which 
they 
were 
brought 
up 
and 
others 
to 
change 
their 
faith, 
why 
people 
join 
or 
desert 
political 
parties, 
why 
there 
are 
different 
schools 
of 
philosophy 
and 
different 
opinions 
concerning 
a 
multiplicity 
of 
problems. 


5. 
The 
Fallacies 
of 
Positivism 
Consistently 
aiming 
at 
an 
improvement 
of 
the 
conditions 
under 
which 
men 
have 
to 
live, 
the 
nations 
of 
Western 
and 
Central 
Europe 
and 
their 
scions 
settled 
in 
overseas 
territories 
have 
succeeded 
in 
developing 
what 
is 
called— 
and 
more 
often 
smeared 
as—Western 
bourgeois 
civilization. 
Its 
foundation 
is 
the 
economic 
system 
of 
capitalism, 
the 
political 
corollary 
of 
which 
is 
representative 
government 
and 
freedom 
of 
thought 
and 
interpersonal 
communication. 
Although 
continually 
sabotaged 
by 
the 
folly 
and 
the 
malice 
of 
the 
masses 
and 
the 
ideological 
remnants 
of 
the 
precapitalistic 
methods 
of 
thinking 
and 
acting, 
free 
enterprise 
has 
radically 
changed 
the 
fate 
of 
man. 
It 
has 
reduced 
mortality 
rates 
and 
prolonged 
the 
average 
length 
of 
life, 
thus 
multiplying 
population 
figures. 
It 
has, 
in 
an 
unprecedented 
way, 
raised 
the 
standard 
of 
living 
of 
the 
average 
man 
in 
those 
nations 
that 
did 
not 
too 
severely 
impede 
the 
acquisitive 
spirit 
of 
enterprising 
individuals. 
All 
people, 
however 
fanatical 
they 
may 
be 
in 
their 
zeal 
to 
disparage 
and 
to 
fight 
capitalism, 
implicitly 
pay 
homage 
to 
it 
by 
passionately 
clamoring 
for 
the 
products 
it 
turns 
out. 


The 
wealth 
capitalism 
has 
brought 
to 
mankind 
is 
not 
an 
achievement 
of 
a 
mythical 
force 
called 
progress. 
Neither 
is 
it 
an 
achievement 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
and 
of 
the 
application 
of 
their 
teachings 
for 
the 
perfection 
of 
technology 
and 
therapeutics. 
No 
technological 
and 
therapeutical 
improvements 
can 
be 
practically 
utilized 
if 
the 
material 
means 
for 
its 
utilization 
have 
not 
been 
previously 
made 
available 
by 
saving 
and 
capital 
accumulation. 
The 
reason 
why 
not 
everything 
about 
the 
production 
and 
the 
use 
of 
which 
technology 
provides 
information 
can 
be 
made 
accessible 
to 
everybody 
is 
the 
insufficiency 
of 
the 
supply 
of 
capital 
accumulated. 
What 
transformed 
the 
stagnant 
conditions 
of 
the 
good 
old 
days 
into 
the 
activism 
of 
capitalism 
was 
not 
changes 
in 
the 
natural 
sciences 
and 
in 
technology, 
but 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
free 
enterprise 
principle. 
The 
great 
ideological 
movement 
that 
started 
with 
the 
Renaissance, 
continued 
in 
the 
Enlightenment, 
and 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
culminated 
in 
Liberalism4 
produced 
both 
capitalism—the 



free 
market 
economy—and 
its 
political 
corollary 
or—as 
the 
Marxians 
have 
to 
say, 
its 
political 
“superstructure”—representative 
government 
and 
the 
individuals’ 
civic 
rights: 
freedom 
of 
conscience, 
of 
thought, 
of 
speech, 
and 
of 
all 
other 
methods 
of 
communication. 
It 
was 
in 
the 
climate 
created 
by 
this 
capitalistic 
system 
of 
individualism 
that 
all 
the 
modern 
intellectual 
achievements 
thrived. 
Never 
before 
had 
mankind 
lived 
under 
conditions 
like 
those 
of 
the 
second 
part 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
when, 
in 
the 
civilized 
countries, 
the 
most 
momentous 
problems 
of 
philosophy, 
religion, 
and 
science 
could 
be 
freely 
discussed 
without 
any 
fear 
of 
reprisals 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
powers 
that 
be. 
It 
was 
an 
age 
of 
productive 
and 
salutary 
dissent. 


A 
countermovement 
evolved, 
but 
not 
from 
a 
regeneration 
of 
the 
discredited 
sinister 
forces 
that 
in 
the 
past 
had 
made 
for 
conformity. 
It 
sprouted 
from 
the 
authoritarian 
and 
dictatorial 
complex 
deeply 
inwrought 
in 
the 
souls 
of 
the 
many 
who 
were 
benefited 
by 
the 
fruits 
of 
freedom 
and 
individualism 
without 
having 
contributed 
anything 
to 
their 
growing 
and 
ripening. 
The 
masses 
do 
not 
like 
those 
who 
surpass 
them 
in 
any 
regard. 
The 
average 
man 
envies 
and 
hates 
those 
who 
are 
different. 


What 
pushes 
the 
masses 
into 
the 
camp 
of 
socialism 
is, 
even 
more 
than 
the 
illusion 
that 
socialism 
will 
make 
them 
richer, 
the 
expectation 
that 
it 
will 
curb 
all 
those 
who 
are 
better 
than 
they 
themselves 
are. 
The 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
all 
Utopian 
plans 
from 
that 
of 
Plato 
down 
to 
that 
of 
Marx 
is 
the 
rigid 
petrification 
of 
all 
human 
conditions. 
Once 
the 
“perfect” 
state 
of 
social 
affairs 
is 
attained, 
no 
further 
changes 
ought 
to 
be 
tolerated. 
There 
will 
no 
longer 
be 
any 
room 
left 
for 
innovators 
and 
reformers. 


In 
the 
intellectual 
sphere 
the 
advocacy 
of 
this 
intolerant 
tyranny 
is 
represented 
by 
positivism. 
Its 
champion, 
Auguste 
Comte, 
did 
not 
contribute 
anything 
to 
the 
advancement 
of 
knowledge. 
He 
merely 
drafted 
the 
scheme 
of 
a 
social 
order 
under 
which, 
in 
the 
name 
of 
progress, 
science, 
and 
humanity, 
any 
deviation 
from 
his 
own 
ideas 
was 
to 
be 
prohibited. 


The 
intellectual 
heirs 
of 
Comte 
are 
the 
contemporary 
positivists. 
Like 
Comte 
himself, 
these 
advocates 
of 
“Unified 
Science,” 
of 
panphysicalism, 
of 
“logical” 
or 
“empirical 
positivism,” 
and 
of 
“scientific” 
philosophy 
did 
not 
themselves 
contribute 
to 
the 
advancement 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
The 
future 
historians 
of 
physics, 
chemistry, 
biology, 
and 
physiology 
will 
not 
have 
to 
mention 
their 
names 
and 
their 
work. 
All 
that 
“Unified 
Science” 
brought 
forward 
was 
to 
recommend 
the 
proscription 
of 
the 
methods 
applied 
by 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
and 
their 
replacement 
by 
the 
methods 
of 
the 



experimental 
natural 
sciences. 
It 
is 
not 
remarkable 
for 
that 
which 
it 
contributed, 
but 
only 
for 
that 
which 
it 
wants 
to 
see 
prohibited. 
Its 
protagonists 
are 
the 
champions 
of 
intolerance 
and 
of 
a 
narrow-minded 
dogmatism. 


Historians 
have 
to 
understand 
the 
political, 
economic, 
and 
intellectual 
conditions 
that 
brought 
about 
positivism, 
old 
and 
new. 
But 
the 
specific 
historical 
understanding 
of 
the 
milieu 
out 
of 
which 
definite 
ideas 
developed 
can 
neither 
justify 
nor 
reject 
the 
teachings 
of 
any 
school 
of 
thought. 
It 
is 
the 
task 
of 
epistemology 
to 
unmask 
the 
fallacies 
of 
positivism 
and 
to 
refute 
them. 



8 


Positivism 
and 
the 
Crisis 
of 
Western 
Civilization 


1. 
The 
Misinterpretation 
of 
the 
Universe 
The 
way 
in 
which 
the 
philosophy 
of 
logical 
positivism 
depicts 
the 
universe 
is 
defective. 
It 
comprehends 
only 
what 
can 
be 
recognized 
by 
the 
experimental 
methods 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
It 
ignores 
the 
human 
mind 
as 
well 
as 
human 
action. 


It 
is 
usual 
to 
justify 
this 
procedure 
by 
pointing 
out 
that 
man 
is 
only 
a 
tiny 
speck 
in 
the 
infinite 
vastness 
of 
the 
universe 
and 
that 
the 
whole 
history 
of 
mankind 
is 
but 
a 
fleeting 
episode 
in 
the 
endless 
flux 
of 
eternity. 
Yet 
the 
importance 
and 
significance 
of 
a 
phenomenon 
defies 
such 
a 
merely 
quantitative 
appraisal. 
Man’s 
place 
in 
that 
part 
of 
the 
universe 
about 
which 
we 
can 
learn 
something 
is 
certainly 
modest 
only. 
But 
as 
far 
as 
we 
can 
see, 
the 
fundamental 
fact 
about 
the 
universe 
is 
that 
it 
is 
divided 
into 
two 
parts, 
which 
—employing 
terms 
suggested 
by 
some 
philosophers, 
but 
without 
their 
metaphysical 
connotation—we 
may 
call 
res 
extensa, 
the 
hard 
facts 
of 
the 
external 
world, 
and 
res 
cogitans, 
man’s 
power 
to 
think. 
We 
do 
not 
know 
how 
the 
mutual 
relations 
of 
these 
two 
spheres 
may 
appear 
in 
the 
vista 
of 
a 
superhuman 
intelligence. 
For 
man 
their 
distinction 
is 
peremptory. 
Perhaps 
it 
is 
only 
the 
inadequacy 
of 
our 
mental 
powers 
that 
prevents 
us 
from 
recognizing 
the 
substantial 
homogeneousness 
of 
what 
appears 
to 
us 
as 
mind 
and 
as 
matter. 
But 
certainly 
no 
palaver 
about 
“unified 
science” 
can 
convert 
the 
metaphysical 
character 
of 
monism 
into 
an 
unassailable 
theorem 
of 
experiential 
knowledge. 
The 
human 
mind 
cannot 
help 
distinguishing 
two 



realms 
of 
reality, 
its 
own 
sphere 
and 
that 
of 
external 
events. 
And 
it 
must 
not 
relegate 
the 
manifestations 
of 
the 
mind 
to 
an 
inferior 
rank, 
as 
it 
is 
only 
the 
mind 
that 
enables 
man 
to 
cognize 
and 
to 
produce 
a 
mental 
representation 
of 
what 
it 
is. 


Positivism’s 
world 
view 
distorts 
the 
fundamental 
experience 
of 
mankind, 
for 
which 
the 
power 
to 
perceive, 
to 
think, 
and 
to 
act 
is 
an 
ultimate 
fact 
clearly 
distinguishable 
from 
all 
that 
happens 
without 
the 
interference 
of 
purposive 
human 
action. 
It 
is 
vain 
to 
talk 
about 
experience 
without 
reference 
to 
the 
factor 
that 
enables 
man 
to 
have 
experience. 


2. 
The 
Misinterpretation 
of 
the 
Human 
Condition 
As 
all 
brands 
of 
positivism 
see 
it, 
the 
eminent 
role 
man 
plays 
on 
the 
earth 
is 
the 
effect 
of 
his 
progress 
in 
the 
cognition 
of 
the 
interconnectedness 
of 
natural—i.e., 
not 
specifically 
mental 
and 
volitional—phenomena 
and 
in 
its 
utilization 
for 
technological 
and 
therapeutical 
behavior. 
Modern 
industrial 
civilization, 
the 
spectacular 
affluence 
it 
has 
produced, 
and 
the 
unprecedented 
increase 
in 
population 
figures 
it 
has 
made 
possible 
are 
the 
fruits 
of 
the 
progressive 
advancement 
of 
the 
experimental 
natural 
sciences. 
The 
main 
factor 
in 
improving 
the 
lot 
of 
mankind 
is 
science, 
i.e., 
in 
the 
positivistic 
terminology, 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
this 
philosophy 
society 
appears 
as 
a 
gigantic 
factory 
and 
all 
social 
problems 
as 
technological 
problems 
to 
be 
solved 
by 
“social 
engineering.” 
What, 
for 
example, 
is 
lacking 
to 
the 
so-called 
underdeveloped 
countries 
is, 
in 
the 
light 
of 
this 
doctrine, 
the 
“know-how,” 
sufficient 
familiarity 
with 
scientific 
technology. 


It 
is 
hardly 
possible 
to 
misinterpret 
mankind’s 
history 
more 
thoroughly. 
The 
fundamental 
fact 
that 
enabled 
man 
to 
elevate 
his 
species 
above 
the 
level 
of 
the 
beasts 
and 
the 
horrors 
of 
biological 
competition 
was 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
higher 
productivity 
of 
cooperation 
under 
a 
system 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor, 
that 
great 
cosmic 
principle 
of 
becoming. 
What 
improved 
and 
still 
improves 
the 
fecundity 
of 
human 
efforts 
is 
the 
progressive 
accumulation 
of 
capital 
goods 
without 
which 
no 
technological 
innovation 
could 
ever 
be 
practically 
utilized. 
No 
technological 
computation 
and 
calculation 
would 
be 
possible 
in 
an 
environment 
that 
would 
not 
employ 
a 
generally 
used 
medium 
of 
exchange, 
money. 
Modern 
industrialization, 
the 
practical 
employment 
of 
the 
discoveries 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences, 
is 
intellectually 
conditioned 
by 
the 
operation 
of 
a 
market 
economy 
in 
which 



prices, 
in 
terms 
of 
money, 
for 
the 
factors 
of 
production 
are 
established 
and 
thus 
the 
opportunity 
is 
given 
to 
the 
engineer 
to 
contrast 
the 
costs 
and 
the 
proceeds 
to 
be 
expected 
from 
alternative 
projects. 
The 
quantification 
of 
physics 
and 
chemistry 
would 
be 
useless 
for 
technological 
planning 
if 
there 
were 
no 
economic 
calculation.1 
What 
is 
lacking 
to 
the 
underdeveloped 
nations 
is 
not 
knowledge, 
but 
capital.2 


The 
popularity 
and 
the 
prestige 
that 
the 
experimental 
methods 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
enjoy 
in 
our 
age 
and 
the 
dedication 
of 
ample 
funds 
for 
the 
conduct 
of 
laboratory 
research 
are 
attendant 
phenomena 
of 
capitalism’s 
progressive 
accumulation 
of 
capital. 
What 
transformed 
the 
world 
of 
horse-
drawn 
carriages, 
sailing 
ships, 
and 
windmills 
step 
by 
step 
into 
a 
world 
of 
airplanes 
and 
electronics 
was 
the 
laissez-faire 
principle 
of 
Manchesterism. 
Large 
savings, 
continuously 
in 
search 
of 
the 
most 
profitable 
investment 
opportunities, 
are 
providing 
the 
resources 
needed 
for 
rendering 
the 
accomplishments 
of 
the 
physicists 
and 
chemists 
utilizable 
for 
the 
improvement 
of 
business 
activities. 
What 
is 
called 
economic 
progress 
is 
the 
joint 
effect 
of 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
three 
progressive 
groups—or 
classes—of 
the 
savers, 
the 
scientist-inventors, 
and 
the 
entrepreneurs, 
operating 
in 
a 
market 
economy 
as 
far 
as 
it 
is 
not 
sabotaged 
by 
the 
endeavors 
of 
the 
nonprogressive 
majority 
of 
the 
routinists 
and 
the 
public 
policies 
supported 
by 
them. 


What 
begot 
all 
those 
technological 
and 
therapeutical 
achievements 
that 
characterize 
our 
age 
was 
not 
science, 
but 
the 
social 
and 
political 
system 
of 
capitalism. 
Only 
in 
the 
climate 
of 
huge 
capital 
accumulation 
could 
experimentalism 
develop 
from 
a 
pastime 
of 
geniuses 
like 
Archimedes 
and 
Leonardo 
da 
Vinci 
into 
a 
well-organized 
systematic 
pursuit 
of 
knowledge. 
The 
much 
decried 
acquisitiveness 
of 
the 
promoters 
and 
speculators 
was 
intent 
upon 
applying 
the 
accomplishments 
of 
scientific 
research 
to 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
masses’ 
standard 
of 
living. 
In 
the 
ideological 
environment 
of 
our 
age, 
which, 
driven 
by 
a 
fanatical 
hatred 
of 
the 
“bourgeois,” 
is 
anxious 
to 
substitute 
the 
“service” 
principle 
for 
the 
“profit” 
principle, 
technological 
innovation 
is 
more 
and 
more 
directed 
toward 
the 
fabrication 
of 
efficient 
instruments 
of 
war 
and 
destruction. 


The 
research 
activities 
of 
the 
experimental 
natural 
sciences 
are 
in 
themselves 
neutral 
with 
regard 
to 
any 
philosophical 
and 
political 
issue. 
But 
they 
can 
thrive 
and 
become 
beneficial 
for 
mankind 
only 
where 
there 
prevails 
a 
social 
philosophy 
of 
individualism 
and 
freedom. 



In 
stressing 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
natural 
sciences 
owe 
all 
their 
achievements 
to 
experience, 
positivism 
merely 
repeated 
a 
truism 
which 
since 
the 
demise 
of 
Naturphilosophie 
nobody 
any 
longer 
disputed. 
In 
disparaging 
the 
methods 
of 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action, 
it 
paved 
the 
way 
for 
the 
forces 
that 
are 
sapping 
the 
foundations 
of 
Western 
civilization. 


3. 
The 
Cult 
of 
Science 
The 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
modern 
Western 
civilization 
is 
not 
its 
scientific 
achievements 
and 
their 
service 
for 
the 
improvement 
of 
people’s 
standard 
of 
living 
and 
the 
prolongation 
of 
the 
average 
length 
of 
life. 
These 
are 
merely 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
social 
order 
in 
which, 
by 
the 
instrumentality 
of 
the 
profit-and-loss 
system, 
the 
most 
eminent 
members 
of 
society 
are 
prompted 
to 
serve 
to 
the 
best 
of 
their 
abilities 
the 
well-being 
of 
the 
masses 
of 
less 
gifted 
people. 
What 
pays 
under 
capitalism 
is 
satisfying 
the 
common 
man, 
the 
customer. 
The 
more 
people 
you 
satisfy, 
the 
better 
for 
you.3 


This 
system 
is 
certainly 
not 
ideal 
or 
perfect. 
There 
is 
in 
human 
affairs 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
perfection. 
But 
the 
only 
alternative 
to 
it 
is 
the 
totalitarian 
system, 
in 
which 
in 
the 
name 
of 
a 
fictitious 
entity, 
“society,” 
a 
group 
of 
directors 
determines 
the 
fate 
of 
all 
the 
people. 
It 
is 
paradoxical 
indeed 
that 
the 
plans 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
system 
that, 
by 
fully 
regulating 
the 
conduct 
of 
every 
human 
being, 
would 
annihilate 
the 
individual’s 
freedom 
were 
proclaimed 
as 
the 
cult 
of 
science. 
Saint-Simon 
usurped 
the 
prestige 
of 
Newton’s 
laws 
of 
gravitation 
as 
a 
cloak 
for 
his 
fantastic 
totalitarianism, 
and 
his 
disciple, 
Comte, 
pretended 
to 
act 
as 
the 
spokesman 
of 
science 
when 
he 
tabooed, 
both 
as 
vain 
and 
as 
useless, 
certain 
astronomical 
studies 
that 
only 
a 
short 
time 
later 
produced 
some 
of 
the 
nineteenth-century’s 
most 
remarkable 
scientific 
results. 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
arrogated 
for 
their 
socialist 
plans 
the 
label 
“scientific.” 
The 
socialist 
or 
communist 
prepossession 
and 
activities 
of 
outstanding 
champions 
of 
logical 
positivism 
and 
“unified 
science” 
are 
well 
known. 


The 
history 
of 
science 
is 
the 
record 
of 
the 
achievements 
of 
individuals 
who 
worked 
in 
isolation 
and, 
very 
often, 
met 
with 
indifference 
or 
even 
open 
hostility 
on 
the 
part 
of 
their 
contemporaries. 
You 
cannot 
write 
a 
history 
of 
science 
“without 
names.” 
What 
matters 
is 
the 
individual, 
not 
“team 
work.” 
One 
cannot 
“organize” 
or 
“institutionalize” 
the 
emergence 
of 
new 
ideas. 
A 
new 
idea 
is 
precisely 
an 
idea 
that 
did 
not 
occur 
to 
those 
who 
designed 
the 



organizational 
frame, 
that 
defies 
their 
plans, 
and 
may 
thwart 
their 
intentions. 
Planning 
other 
peoples’ 
actions 
means 
to 
prevent 
them 
from 
planning 
for 
themselves, 
means 
to 
deprive 
them 
of 
their 
essentially 
human 
quality, 
means 
enslaving 
them. 


The 
great 
crisis 
of 
our 
civilization 
is 
the 
outcome 
of 
this 
enthusiasm 
for 
all-round 
planning. 
There 
have 
always 
been 
people 
prepared 
to 
restrict 
their 
fellow 
citizens’ 
right 
and 
power 
to 
choose 
their 
own 
conduct. 
The 
common 
man 
always 
looked 
askance 
upon 
all 
those 
who 
eclipsed 
him 
in 
any 
regard, 
and 
he 
advocated 
conformity, 
Gleichschaltung. 
What 
is 
new 
and 
characterizes 
our 
age 
is 
that 
the 
advocates 
of 
uniformity 
and 
conformity 
are 
raising 
their 
claims 
on 
behalf 
of 
science. 


4. 
The 
Epistemological 
Support 
of 
Totalitarianism 
Every 
step 
forward 
on 
the 
way 
toward 
substituting 
more 
efficient 
methods 
of 
production 
for 
the 
obsolete 
methods 
of 
the 
precapitalistic 
ages 
met 
with 
fanatical 
hostility 
on 
the 
part 
of 
those 
whose 
vested 
interests 
were 
in 
the 
short 
run 
hurt 
by 
any 
innovation. 
The 
landed 
interest 
of 
the 
aristocrats 
was 
no 
less 
anxious 
to 
preserve 
the 
economic 
system 
of 
the 
ancien 
régime 
than 
were 
the 
rioting 
workingmen 
who 
destroyed 
machines 
and 
demolished 
factory 
buildings. 
But 
the 
cause 
of 
innovation 
was 
supported 
by 
the 
new 
science 
of 
political 
economy, 
while 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
obsolete 
methods 
of 
production 
lacked 
a 
tenable 
ideological 
basis. 


As 
all 
the 
attempts 
to 
prevent 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
factory 
system 
and 
its 
technological 
accomplishments 
aborted, 
the 
syndicalist 
idea 
began 
to 
take 
shape. 
Throw 
out 
the 
entrepreneur, 
that 
lazy 
and 
useless 
parasite, 
and 
hand 
over 
all 
the 
proceeds—the 
“whole 
produce 
of 
labor”—to 
the 
men 
who 
create 
them 
by 
their 
toil! 
But 
even 
the 
most 
bigoted 
enemies 
of 
the 
new 
industrial 
methods 
could 
not 
fail 
to 
realize 
the 
inadequacy 
of 
these 
schemes. 
Syndicalism 
remained 
the 
philosophy 
of 
illiterate 
mobs 
and 
got 
the 
approbation 
of 
intellectuals 
only 
much 
later 
in 
the 
guise 
of 
British 
Guild 
Socialism, 
Italian 
Fascism’s 
stato 
corporativo, 
and 
twentieth-century 
“labor 
economics” 
and 
labor 
union 
politics.4 


The 
great 
anticapitalistic 
device 
was 
socialism, 
not 
syndicalism. 
But 
there 
was 
something 
that 
embarrassed 
the 
socialist 
parties 
from 
the 
early 
beginnings 
of 
their 
propaganda, 
their 
inability 
to 
refute 
the 
criticism 
that 
their 
schemes 
met 
on 
the 
part 
of 
economics. 
Fully 
aware 
of 
his 
impotence 
in 
this 



regard, 
Karl 
Marx 
resorted 
to 
a 
subterfuge. 
He 
and 
his 
followers, 
down 
to 
those 
who 
called 
their 
doctrines 
“sociology 
of 
knowledge,” 
tried 
to 
discredit 
economics 
by 
their 
spurious 
ideology-concept. 
As 
the 
Marxians 
see 
it, 
in 
a 
“class 
society” 
men 
are 
inherently 
unfit 
to 
conceive 
theories 
that 
are 
a 
substantially 
true 
description 
of 
reality. 
A 
man’s 
thoughts 
are 
necessarily 
tainted 
“ideologically.” 
An 
ideology, 
in 
the 
Marxian 
sense 
of 
the 
term, 
is 
a 
false 
doctrine, 
which, 
however, 
precisely 
on 
account 
of 
its 
falsity, 
serves 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
class 
from 
which 
its 
author 
stems. 
There 
is 
no 
need 
to 
answer 
any 
critique 
of 
the 
socialist 
plans. 
It 
is 
fully 
sufficient 
to 
unmask 
the 
nonproletarian 
background 
of 
its 
author.5 


This 
Marxian 
polylogism 
is 
the 
living 
philosophy 
and 
epistemology 
of 
our 
age. 
It 
aims 
at 
making 
the 
Marxian 
doctrine 
impregnable, 
as 
it 
implicitly 
defines 
truth 
as 
agreement 
with 
Marxism. 
An 
adversary 
of 
Marxism 
is 
necessarily 
always 
wrong 
on 
account 
of 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
he 
is 
an 
adversary. 
If 
the 
dissenter 
is 
of 
proletarian 
origin, 
he 
is 
a 
traitor; 
if 
he 
belongs 
to 
another 
“class,” 
he 
is 
an 
enemy 
of 
“the 
class 
that 
holds 
the 
future 
in 
its 
hands.” 
6 


The 
spell 
of 
this 
Marxian 
eristic 
trick 
was 
and 
is 
so 
enormous 
that 
even 
the 
students 
of 
the 
history 
of 
ideas 
failed 
for 
a 
long 
time 
to 
realize 
that 
positivism, 
following 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
Comte, 
offered 
another 
makeshift 
to 
discredit 
economics 
wholesale 
without 
entering 
into 
any 
critical 
analysis 
of 
its 
argumentation. 
For 
the 
positivists, 
economics 
is 
no 
science 
because 
it 
does 
not 
resort 
to 
the 
experimental 
methods 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
Thus, 
Comte 
and 
those 
of 
his 
followers 
who 
under 
the 
label 
of 
sociology 
preached 
the 
total 
state 
could 
dub 
economics 
as 
metaphysical 
nonsense 
and 
were 
freed 
from 
the 
necessity 
to 
refute 
its 
teachings 
by 
discursive 
reasoning. 
When 
the 
revisionism 
of 
Bernstein 
had 
temporarily 
weakened 
the 
popular 
prestige 
of 
Marxian 
orthodoxy, 
some 
younger 
members 
of 
the 
Marxian 
parties 
began 
to 
search 
in 
the 
writings 
of 
Avenarius 
and 
Mach 
for 
a 
philosophical 
justification 
of 
the 
socialist 
creed. 
This 
defection 
from 
the 
straight 
line 
of 
dialectical 
materialism 
appeared 
as 
sacrilege 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
uncompromising 
guardians 
of 
the 
undefiled 
doctrine. 
Lenin’s 
most 
voluminous 
contribution 
to 
the 
socialist 
literature 
is 
a 
passionate 
attack 
upon 
the 
“middle-class 
philosophy” 
of 
empirio-criticism 
and 
its 
adepts 
in 
the 
ranks 
of 
the 
socialist 
parties.7 
In 
the 
spiritual 
ghetto 
into 
which 
Lenin 
had 
confined 
himself 
during 
all 
of 
his 
life 
he 
could 
not 
become 
aware 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Marxian 
ideology-doctrine 
had 
lost 
its 
persuasive 
power 
in 
the 
circles 
of 
the 
natural 
scientists 
and 
that 
positivism’s 
panphysicalism 
could 
render 
better 
services 
in 



the 
campaigns 
to 
vilify 
economic 
science 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
mathematicians, 
physicists, 
and 
biologists. 
However, 
a 
few 
years 
later, 
Otto 
Neurath 
instilled 
into 
the 
methodological 
monism 
of 
“unified 
science” 
its 
definite 
anti-
capitalistic 
note 
and 
converted 
neopositivism 
into 
an 
auxiliary 
of 
socialism 
and 
communism. 
Today 
both 
doctrines, 
Marxian 
polylogism 
and 
positivism, 
amicably 
vie 
with 
each 
other 
in 
lending 
theoretical 
support 
to 
the 
“Left.” 
For 
the 
philosophers, 
mathematicians, 
and 
biologists 
there 
is 
the 
esoteric 
doctrine 
of 
logical 
or 
empirical 
positivism, 
while 
the 
less 
sophisticated 
masses 
are 
still 
fed 
a 
garbled 
variety 
of 
dialectical 
materialism. 


Even 
if, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
argument, 
we 
may 
assume 
that 
the 
rejection 
of 
economics 
by 
panphysicalism 
was 
motivated 
by 
logical 
and 
epistemological 
considerations 
only 
and 
that 
neither 
political 
bias 
nor 
envy 
of 
people 
with 
higher 
salaries 
or 
greater 
wealth 
played 
any 
role 
in 
the 
matter, 
we 
must 
not 
pass 
over 
in 
silence 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
champions 
of 
radical 
empiricism 
stubbornly 
refuse 
to 
pay 
any 
attention 
to 
the 
teachings 
of 
daily 
experience 
contradicting 
their 
socialist 
predilections. 
They 
not 
only 
neglect 
the 
failure 
of 
all 
“experiments” 
with 
nationalized 
business 
in 
the 
Western 
countries. 
They 
do 
not 
care 
a 
whit 
about 
the 
undisputed 
fact 
that 
the 
average 
standard 
of 
living 
is 
incomparably 
higher 
in 
the 
capitalistic 
countries 
than 
in 
the 
communist 
countries. 
If 
pressed 
hard, 
they 
try 
to 
push 
aside 
this 
“experience” 
by 
interpreting 
it 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
capitalists’ 
alleged 
anticommunist 
machinations.8 
Whatever 
one 
may 
think 
about 
this 
poor 
excuse, 
it 
cannot 
be 
denied 
that 
it 
amounts 
to 
a 
spectacular 
repudiation 
of 
the 
very 
principle 
that 
considers 
experience 
as 
the 
only 
source 
of 
knowledge. 
For 
in 
the 
view 
of 
this 
principle, 
it 
is 
not 
permitted 
to 
conjure 
away 
a 
fact 
of 
experience 
by 
referring 
to 
some 
allegedly 
theoretical 
reflections. 


5. 
The 
Consequences 
The 
outstanding 
fact 
about 
the 
contemporary 
ideological 
situation 
is 
that 
the 
most 
popular 
political 
doctrines 
aim 
at 
totalitarianism, 
the 
thorough 
abolition 
of 
the 
individual’s 
freedom 
to 
choose 
and 
to 
act. 
No 
less 
remarkable 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
most 
bigoted 
advocates 
of 
such 
a 
system 
of 
conformity 
call 
themselves 
scientists, 
logicians, 
and 
philosophers. 


This 
is, 
of 
course, 
not 
a 
new 
phenomenon. 
Plato, 
who 
even 
more 
than 
Aristotle 
was 
for 
centuries 
the 
maestro 
di 
color 
che 
sanno, 
elaborated 
a 
plan 
of 
totalitarianism 
the 
radicalism 
of 
which 
was 
surpassed 
only 
in 
the 



nineteenth 
century 
by 
the 
schemes 
of 
Comte 
and 
Marx. 
It 
is 
a 
fact 
that 
many 
philosophers 
are 
utterly 
intolerant 
of 
any 
dissent 
and 
want 
to 
have 
any 
criticism 
of 
their 
own 
ideas 
prevented 
by 
the 
government’s 
police 
apparatus. 


As 
far 
as 
the 
empiricist 
principle 
of 
logical 
positivism 
refers 
to 
the 
experimental 
methods 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences, 
it 
merely 
asserts 
what 
is 
not 
questioned 
by 
anybody. 
As 
far 
as 
it 
rejects 
the 
epistemological 
principles 
of 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action, 
it 
is 
not 
only 
entirely 
wrong. 
It 
is 
also 
knowingly 
and 
intentionally 
undermining 
the 
intellectual 
foundations 
of 
Western 
civilization.

When 
H. 
Taine 
in 
1863 
wrote, 
“L’histoire 
au 
fond 
est 
un 
problème 
de 

psychologie” 
(Histoire 
de 
la 
litérature 
anglaise 
[10th 
ed.; 
Paris, 
1899], 
Vol. 
I, 
Introduction, 
p. 
xlv), 
he 
did 
not 
realize 
that 
the 
kind 
of 
psychology 
he 
had 
in 
mind 
was 
not 
the 
natural 
science 
called 
experimental 
psychology, 
but 
that 
kind 
of 
psychology 
we 
call 
thymology 
and 
that 
thymology 
is 
in 
itself 
a 
historical 
discipline, 
a 
Geisteswissenschaft 
in 
the 
terminology 
of 
W. 
Dilthey 
(Einleitung 
in 
die 
Geisteswissenschaften 
[Leipzig, 
1883]). 
R. 
G. 
Collingwood 
(The 
Idea 
of 
History 
[Oxford, 
1946], 


p. 
221) 
distinguishes 
between 
“historical 
thought” 
that 
“studies 
mind 
as 
acting 
in 
certain 
determinate 
ways 
in 
certain 
determinate 
situations” 
and 
a 
problematic 
other 
way 
of 
studying 
mind, 
viz., 
by 
“investigating 
its 
general 
characteristics 
in 
abstraction 
from 
any 
particular 
situation 
or 
particular 
action.” 
The 
latter 
would 
be 
“not 
history, 
but 
mental 
science, 
psychology, 
or 
the 
philosophy 
of 
mind.” 
Such 
“a 
positive 
mental 
science 
as 
rising 
above 
the 
sphere 
of 
history, 
and 
establishing 
the 
permanent 
and 
unchanging 
laws 
of 
human 
nature,” 
he 
points 
out 
(p. 
224), 
is 
“possible 
only 
to 
a 
person 
who 
mistakes 
the 
transient 
conditions 
of 
a 
certain 
historical 
age 
for 
the 
permanent 
conditions 
of 
human 
life.”

Etymologicallly, 
the 
term 
“party” 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
term 
“part” 
as 
contrasted 
with 
the 
term 
“whole.” 
A 
brotherless 
party 
does 
not 
differ 
from 
the 
whole 
and 
is 
therefore 
not 
a 
party. 
The 
slogan 
“one-party 
system” 
was 
invented 
by 
the 
Russian 
Communists 
(and 
aped 
by 
their 
adepts, 
the 
Italian 
Fascists 
and 
the 
German 
Nazis) 
to 
conceal 
the 
abolition 
of 
the 
individual’s 
freedom 
and 
right 
to 
dissent.

this 
incident,

It 
was 
not 
the 
revolutions 
of 
the 
seventeenth 
century 
that 
transformed 
the 
British 
system 
of 
government. 
The 
effects 
of 
the 
first 
revoluton 
were 
annulled 
by 
the 
Restoration, 
and 
in 
the 
Glorious 
Revolution 
of 
1688 
the 
royal 
office 
was 
merely 
transferred 
from 
the 
“legitimate” 
king 
to 
other 
members 
of 
his 
family. 
The 
struggle 
between 
dynastic 
absolutism 
and 
the 
parliamentary 
regime 
of 
the 
landed 
aristocracy 
continued 
during 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
century. 
It 
came 
to 
an 
end 
only 
when 
the 
attempts 
of 
the 
third 
Hanoverian 
king 
to 
revive 
the 
personal 
regime 
of 
the 
Tudors 
and 
the 
Stuarts 
were 
frustrated. 
The 
substitution 
of 
popular 
rule 
for 
that 
of 
the 
aristocracy 
was—in 
the 
nineteenth 
century—brought 
about 
by 
a 
succession 
of 
franchise 
reforms.

The 
term 
Liberalism 
as 
employed 
in 
this 
essay 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
in 
its 
classical 
nineteenth-century 
connotation, 
not 
in 
its 
present-day 
American 
sense, 
in 
which 
it 
signifies 
the 
opposite 
of 
everything 
that 
it 
used 
to 
signify 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
century.

the 
often 
raised 
question 
why 
the 
ancient

did 
not 
construct 
steam

their 
physics 
gave 
them 
the 
theoretical 
knowledge
