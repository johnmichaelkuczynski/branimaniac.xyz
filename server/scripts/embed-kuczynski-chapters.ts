  { content: "There are two parts to any inference: the premises and the conclusion.", domain: "skepticism_induction", work: "Analytic Philosophy Chapter 12" },
  { content: "There are two kinds of inferences: deductive and inductive.", domain: "skepticism_induction", work: "Analytic Philosophy Chapter 12" },
  { content: "An inference is deductive if, supposing that one's premises are true and one's reasoning non-faulty, it is impossible for one's conclusion to be false.", domain: "skepticism_induction", work: "Analytic Philosophy Chapter 12" },
  { content: "An inference is inductive if, supposing that one's premises are true and one's reasoning non-faulty, it is possible for one's conclusion to be false.", domain: "skepticism_induction", work: "Analytic Philosophy Chapter 12" },
  { content: "A skeptic about inductive inference holds that it is impossible, as a matter of principle, to learn anything through non-deductive inference.", domain: "skepticism_induction", work: "Analytic Philosophy Chapter 12" },
  { content: "David Hume made it clear why it may be doubted whether inductive inference ever leads to knowledge.", domain: "skepticism_induction", work: "Analytic Philosophy Chapter 12" },
  { content: "Hume's argument: Consider some inductive inference—for example, 'the sun has always risen in the past; therefore, it will rise tomorrow.'", domain: "skepticism_induction", work: "Analytic Philosophy Chapter 12" },
  { content: "This argument is not deductive, since, even if the premise is granted, it isn't a theoretical impossibility that the conclusion will be false.", domain: "skepticism_induction", work: "Analytic Philosophy Chapter 12" },
  { content: "Given that the connection between premise and conclusion isn't deductive, we must ask: how does the premise warrant the conclusion?", domain: "skepticism_induction", work: "Analytic Philosophy Chapter 12" },

  { content: "In actuality, induction by enumeration is less important than, and subordinate to, a very different form of non-deductive inference known as inference to the best explanation.", domain: "skepticism_induction", work: "Analytic Philosophy Chapter 12" },
  { content: "Second, Hume assumes that non-deductive inferences go through only if UP is granted.", domain: "skepticism_induction", work: "Analytic Philosophy Chapter 12" },
  { content: "What must be granted, I propose, is that good explanations minimize causal anomalies.", domain: "skepticism_induction", work: "Analytic Philosophy Chapter 12" },
  { content: "Let's refer to this principle as 'MC' (short for 'minimization of causal anomalies').", domain: "skepticism_induction", work: "Analytic Philosophy Chapter 12" },
  { content: "Unlike UP, MC is, I submit, analytically true.", domain: "skepticism_induction", work: "Analytic Philosophy Chapter 12" },
  { content: "There are two forms of inductive inference: induction by enumeration and inference to the best explanation.", domain: "skepticism_induction", work: "Analytic Philosophy Chapter 12" },
  { content: "An induction by enumeration has the form: every F that I've ever known of was also a G; therefore all F's are G's.", domain: "skepticism_induction", work: "Analytic Philosophy Chapter 12" },
  { content: "An inference to the best explanation has the form: it is known that S; it isn't yet known that S*; but if S* were true, it would, without doing excessive violence to what we (think we) know about the world, explain why S is true.", domain: "skepticism_induction", work: "Analytic Philosophy Chapter 12" },
