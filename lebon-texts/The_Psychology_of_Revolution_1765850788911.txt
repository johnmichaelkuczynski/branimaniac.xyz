CONCLUSIONS 



THE 
PSYCHOLOGY 
OF 
REVOLUTION 


INTRODUCTION 


THE 
REVISION 
OF 
HISTORY 


The 
present 
age 
is 
not 
merely 
an 
epoch 
of 
discovery; 
it 
is 
also 
a 
period 
of 
revision 
of 
the 
various 
elements 
of 
knowledge. 
Having 
recognised 
that 
there 
are 
no 
phenomena 
of 
which 
the 
first 
cause 
is 
still 
accessible, 
science 
has 
resumed 
the 
examination 
of 
her 
ancient 
certitudes, 
and 
has 
proved 
their 
fragility. 
To-day 
she 
sees 
her 
ancient 
principles 
vanishing 
one 
by 
one. 
Mechanics 
is 
losing 
its 
axioms, 
and 
matter, 
formerly 
the 
eternal 
substratum 
of 
the 
worlds, 
becomes 
a 
simple 
aggregate 
of 
ephemeral 
forces 
in 
transitory 
condensation. 


Despite 
its 
conjectural 
side, 
by 
virtue 
of 
which 
it 
to 
some 
extent 
escapes 
the 
severest 
form 
of 
criticism, 
history 
has 
not 
been 
free 
from 
this 
universal 
revision. 
There 
is 
no 
longer 
a 
single 
one 
of 
its 
phases 
of 
which 
we 
can 
say 
that 
it 
is 
certainly 
known. 
What 
appeared 
to 
be 
definitely 
acquired 
is 
now 
once 
more 
put 
in 
question. 


Among 
the 
events 
whose 
study 
seemed 
completed 
was 
the 
French 
Revolution. 
Analysed 
by 
several 
generations 
of 
writers, 
one 
might 
suppose 
it 
to 
be 
perfectly 
elucidated. 
What 
new 
thing 
can 
be 
said 
of 
it, 
except 
in 
modification 
of 
some 
of 
its 
details? 


And 
yet 
its 
most 
positive 
defenders 
are 
beginning 
to 
hesitate 
in 
their 
judgments. 
Ancient 
evidence 
proves 
to 
be 
far 
from 
impeccable. 
The 
faith 
in 
dogmas 
once 
held 
sacred 
is 
shaken. 
The 
latest 
literature 
of 
the 
Revolution 
betrays 
these 
uncertainties. 
Having 
related, 
men 
are 
more 
and 
more 
chary 
of 
drawing 
conclusions. 


Not 
only 
are 
the 
heroes 
of 
this 
great 
drama 
discussed 
without 
indulgence, 
but 
thinkers 
are 
asking 
whether 
the 
new 
dispensation 
which 
followed 
the 
ancien 
regime 
would 
not 
have 
established 
itself 
naturally, 
without 
violence, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
progressive 
civilisation. 
The 
results 
obtained 
no 
longer 
seem 



in 
correspondence 
either 
with 
their 
immediate 
cost 
or 
with 
the 
remoter 
consequences 
which 
the 
Revolution 
evoked 
from 
the 
possibilities 
of 
history. 


Several 
causes 
have 
led 
to 
the 
revision 
of 
this 
tragic 
period. 
Time 
has 
calmed 
passions, 
numerous 
documents 
have 
gradually 
emerged 
from 
the 
archives, 
and 
the 
historian 
is 
learning 
to 
interpret 
them 
independently. 


But 
it 
is 
perhaps 
modern 
psychology 
that 
has 
most 
effectually 
influenced 
our 
ideas, 
by 
enabling 
us 
more 
surely 
to 
read 
men 
and 
the 
motives 
of 
their 
conduct. 


Among 
those 
of 
its 
discoveries 
which 
are 
henceforth 
applicable 
to 
history 
we 
must 
mention, 
above 
all, 
a 
more 
profound 
understanding 
of 
ancestral 
influences, 
the 
laws 
which 
rule 
the 
actions 
of 
the 
crowd, 
data 
relating 
to 
the 
disaggregation 
of 
personality, 
mental 
contagion, 
the 
unconscious 
formation 
of 
beliefs, 
and 
the 
distinction 
between 
the 
various 
forms 
of 
logic. 


To 
tell 
the 
truth, 
these 
applications 
of 
science, 
which 
are 
utilised 
in 
this 
book, 
have 
not 
been 
so 
utilised 
hitherto. 
Historians 
have 
generally 
stopped 
short 
at 
the 
study 
of 
documents, 
and 
even 
that 
study 
is 
sufficient 
to 
excite 
the 
doubts 
of 
which 
I 
have 
spoken. 


The 
great 
events 
which 
shape 
the 
destinies 
of 
peoples— 
revolutions, 
for 
example, 
and 
the 
outbreak 
of 
religious 
beliefs— 
are 
sometimes 
so 
difficult 
to 
explain 
that 
one 
must 
limit 
oneself 
to 
a 
mere 
statement. 


From 
the 
time 
of 
my 
first 
historical 
researches 
I 
have 
been 
struck 
by 
the 
impenetrable 
aspect 
of 
certain 
essential 
phenomena, 
those 
relating 
to 
the 
genesis 
of 
beliefs 
especially; 
I 
felt 
convinced 
that 
something 
fundamental 
was 
lacking 
that 
was 
essential 
to 
their 
interpretation. 
Reason 
having 
said 
all 
it 
could 
say, 
nothing 
more 
could 
be 
expected 
of 
it, 
and 
other 
means 
must 
be 
sought 
of 
comprehending 
what 
had 
not 
been 
elucidated. 


For 
a 
long 
time 
these 
important 
questions 
remained 
obscure 
to 
me. 
Extended 
travel, 
devoted 
to 
the 
study 
of 
the 
remnants 
of 
vanished 
civilisations, 
had 
not 
done 
much 
to 
throw 
light 
upon 
them. 


Reflecting 
upon 
it 
continually, 
I 
was 
forced 
to 
recognise 
that 
the 
problem 
was 
composed 
of 
a 
series 
of 
other 
problems, 
which 
I 
should 
have 
to 
study 
separately. 
This 
I 
did 
for 
a 
period 
of 
twenty 
years, 
presenting 
the 
results 
of 
my 
researches 
in 
a 
succession 
of 
volumes. 


One 
of 
the 
first 
was 
devoted 
to 
the 
study 
of 
the 
psychological 
laws 
of 
the 
evolution 
of 
peoples. 
Having 
shown 
that 
the 
historic 
races—that 
is, 
the 
races 



formed 
by 
the 
hazards 
of 
history—finally 
acquired 
psychological 
characteristics 
as 
stable 
as 
their 
anatomical 
characteristics, 
I 
attempted 
to 
explain 
how 
a 
people 
transforms 
its 
institutions, 
its 
languages, 
and 
its 
arts. 
I 
explained 
in 
the 
same 
work 
why 
it 
was 
that 
individual 
personalities, 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
sudden 
variations 
of 
environment, 
might 
be 
entirely 
disaggregated. 


But 
besides 
the 
fixed 
collectivities 
formed 
by 
the 
peoples, 
there 
are 
mobile 
and 
transitory 
collectivities 
known 
as 
crowds. 
Now 
these 
crowds 
or 
mobs, 
by 
the 
aid 
of 
which 
the 
great 
movements 
of 
history 
are 
accomplished, 
have 
characteristics 
absolutely 
different 
from 
those 
of 
the 
individuals 
who 
compose 
them. 
What 
are 
these 
characteristics, 
and 
how 
are 
they 
evolved? 
This 
new 
problem 
was 
examined 
in 
The 
Psychology 
of 
the 
Crowd. 


Only 
after 
these 
studies 
did 
I 
begin 
to 
perceive 
certain 
influences 
which 
had 
escaped 
me. 


But 
this 
was 
not 
all. 
Among 
the 
most 
important 
factors 
of 
history 
one 
was 
preponderant—the 
factor 
of 
beliefs. 
How 
are 
these 
beliefs 
born, 
and 
are 
they 
really 
rational 
and 
voluntary, 
as 
was 
long 
taught? 
Are 
they 
not 
rather 
unconscious 
and 
independent 
of 
all 
reason? 
A 
difficult 
question, 
which 
I 
dealt 
with 
in 
my 
last 
book, 
Opinions 
and 
Beliefs. 


So 
long 
as 
psychology 
regards 
beliefs 
as 
voluntary 
and 
rational 
they 
will 
remain 
inexplicable. 
Having 
proved 
that 
they 
are 
usually 
irrational 
and 
always 
involuntary, 
I 
was 
able 
to 
propound 
the 
solution 
of 
this 
important 
problem; 
how 
it 
was 
that 
beliefs 
which 
no 
reason 
could 
justify 
were 
admitted 
without 
difficulty 
by 
the 
most 
enlightened 
spirits 
of 
all 
ages. 


The 
solution 
of 
the 
historical 
difficulties 
which 
had 
so 
long 
been 
sought 
was 
thenceforth 
obvious. 
I 
arrived 
at 
the 
conclusion 
that 
beside 
the 
rational 
logic 
which 
conditions 
thought, 
and 
was 
formerly 
regarded 
as 
our 
sole 
guide, 
there 
exist 
very 
different 
forms 
of 
logic: 
affective 
logic, 
collective 
logic, 
and 
mystic 
logic, 
which 
usually 
overrule 
the 
reason 
and 
engender 
the 
generative 
impulses 
of 
our 
conduct. 


This 
fact 
well 
established, 
it 
seemed 
to 
me 
evident 
that 
if 
a 
great 
number 
of 
historical 
events 
are 
often 
uncomprehended, 
it 
is 
because 
we 
seek 
to 
interpret 
them 
in 
the 
light 
of 
a 
logic 
which 
in 
reality 
has 
very 
little 
influence 
upon 
their 
genesis. 


All 
these 
researches, 
which 
are 
here 
summed 
up 
in 
a 
few 
lines, 
demanded 



long 
years 
for 
their 
accomplishment. 
Despairing 
of 
completing 
them, 
I 
abandoned 
them 
more 
than 
once 
to 
return 
to 
those 
labours 
of 
the 
laboratory 
in 
which 
one 
is 
always 
sure 
of 
skirting 
the 
truth 
and 
of 
acquiring 
fragments 
at 
least 
of 
certitude. 


But 
while 
it 
is 
very 
interesting 
to 
explore 
the 
world 
of 
material 
phenomena, 
it 
is 
still 
more 
so 
to 
decipher 
men, 
for 
which 
reason 
I 
have 
always 
been 
led 
back 
to 
psychology. 


Certain 
principles 
deduced 
from 
my 
researches 
appearing 
likely 
to 
prove 
fruitful, 
I 
resolved 
to 
apply 
them 
to 
the 
study 
of 
concrete 
instances, 
and 
was 
thus 
led 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
Psychology 
of 
Revolutions—notably 
that 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution. 


Proceeding 
in 
the 
analysis 
of 
our 
great 
Revolution, 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
opinions 
determined 
by 
the 
reading 
of 
books 
deserted 
me 
one 
by 
one, 
although 
I 
had 
considered 
them 
unshakable. 


To 
explain 
this 
period 
we 
must 
consider 
it 
as 
a 
whole, 
as 
many 
historians 
have 
done. 
It 
is 
composed 
of 
phenomena 
simultaneous 
but 
independent 
of 
one 
another. 


Each 
of 
its 
phases 
reveals 
events 
engendered 
by 
psychological 
laws 
working 
with 
the 
regularity 
of 
clockwork. 
The 
actors 
in 
this 
great 
drama 
seem 
to 
move 
like 
the 
characters 
of 
a 
previously 
determined 
drama. 
Each 
says 
what 
he 
must 
say, 
acts 
as 
he 
is 
bound 
to 
act. 


To 
be 
sure, 
the 
actors 
in 
the 
revolutionary 
drama 
differed 
from 
those 
of 
a 
written 
drama 
in 
that 
they 
had 
not 
studied 
their 
parts, 
but 
these 
were 
dictated 
by 
invisible 
forces. 


Precisely 
because 
they 
were 
subjected 
to 
the 
inevitable 
progression 
of 
logics 
incomprehensible 
to 
them 
we 
see 
them 
as 
greatly 
astonished 
by 
the 
events 
of 
which 
they 
were 
the 
heroes 
as 
are 
we 
ourselves. 
Never 
did 
they 
suspect 
the 
invisible 
powers 
which 
forced 
them 
to 
act. 
They 
were 
the 
masters 
neither 
of 
their 
fury 
nor 
their 
weakness. 
They 
spoke 
in 
the 
name 
of 
reason, 
pretending 
to 
be 
guided 
by 
reason, 
but 
in 
reality 
it 
was 
by 
no 
means 
reason 
that 
impelled 
them. 


``The 
decisions 
for 
which 
we 
are 
so 
greatly 
reproached,'' 
wrote 
Billaud-
Varenne, 
``were 
more 
often 
than 
otherwise 
not 
intended 
or 
desired 
by 
us 
two 
days 
or 
even 
one 
day 
beforehand: 
the 
crisis 
alone 
evoked 
them.'' 


Not 
that 
we 
must 
consider 
the 
events 
of 
the 
Revolution 
as 
dominated 
by 
an 
imperious 
fatality. 
The 
readers 
of 
our 
works 
will 
know 
that 
we 
recognise 
in 
the 
man 
of 
superior 
qualities 
the 
role 
of 
averting 
fatalities. 
But 
he 
can 



dissociate 
himself 
only 
from 
a 
few 
of 
such, 
and 
is 
often 
powerless 
before 
the 
sequence 
of 
events 
which 
even 
at 
their 
origin 
could 
scarcely 
be 
ruled. 
The 
scientist 
knows 
how 
to 
destroy 
the 
microbe 
before 
it 
has 
time 
to 
act, 
but 
he 
knows 
himself 
powerless 
to 
prevent 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
resulting 
malady. 


When 
any 
question 
gives 
rise 
to 
violently 
contradictory 
opinions 
we 
may 
be 
sure 
that 
it 
belongs 
to 
the 
province 
of 
beliefs 
and 
not 
to 
that 
of 
knowledge. 


We 
have 
shown 
in 
a 
preceding 
work 
that 
belief, 
of 
unconscious 
origin 
and 
independent 
of 
all 
reason, 
can 
never 
be 
influenced 
by 
reason. 


The 
Revolution, 
the 
work 
of 
believers, 
has 
seldom 
been 
judged 
by 
any 
but 
believers. 
Execrated 
by 
some 
and 
praised 
by 
others, 
it 
has 
remained 
one 
of 
those 
dogmas 
which 
are 
accepted 
or 
rejected 
as 
a 
whole, 
without 
the 
intervention 
of 
rational 
logic. 


Although 
in 
its 
beginnings 
a 
religious 
or 
political 
revolution 
may 
very 
well 
be 
supported 
by 
rational 
elements, 
it 
is 
developed 
only 
by 
the 
aid 
of 
mystic 
and 
affective 
elements 
which 
are 
absolutely 
foreign 
to 
reason. 


The 
historians 
who 
have 
judged 
the 
events 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution 
in 
the 
name 
of 
rational 
logic 
could 
not 
comprehend 
them, 
since 
this 
form 
of 
logic 
did 
not 
dictate 
them. 
As 
the 
actors 
of 
these 
events 
themselves 
understood 
them 
but 
ill, 
we 
shall 
not 
be 
far 
from 
the 
truth 
in 
saying 
that 
our 
Revolution 
was 
a 
phenomenon 
equally 
misunderstood 
by 
those 
who 
caused 
it 
and 
by 
those 
who 
have 
described 
it. 
At 
no 
period 
of 
history 
did 
men 
so 
little 
grasp 
the 
present, 
so 
greatly 
ignore 
the 
past, 
and 
so 
poorly 
divine 
the 
future. 


. 
. 
. 
The 
power 
of 
the 
Revolution 
did 
not 
reside 
in 
the 
principles—which 
for 
that 
matter 
were 
anything 
but 
novel—which 
it 
sought 
to 
propagate, 
nor 
in 
the 
institutions 
which 
it 
sought 
to 
found. 
The 
people 
cares 
very 
little 
for 
institutions 
and 
even 
less 
for 
doctrines. 
That 
the 
Revolution 
was 
potent 
indeed, 
that 
it 
made 
France 
accept 
the 
violence, 
the 
murders, 
the 
ruin 
and 
the 
horror 
of 
a 
frightful 
civil 
war, 
that 
finally 
it 
defended 
itself 
victoriously 
against 
a 
Europe 
in 
arms, 
was 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
had 
founded 
not 
a 
new 
system 
of 
government 
but 
a 
new 
religion. 


Now 
history 
shows 
us 
how 
irresistible 
is 
the 
might 
of 
a 
strong 
belief. 
Invincible 
Rome 
herself 
had 
to 
bow 
before 
the 
armies 
of 
nomad 
shepherds 
illuminated 
by 
the 
faith 
of 
Mahommed. 
For 
the 
same 
reason 
the 
kings 
of 
Europe 
could 
not 
resist 
the 
tatterdemalion 
soldiers 
of 
the 
Convention. 
Like 
all 



apostles, 
they 
were 
ready 
to 
immolate 
themselves 
in 
the 
sole 
end 
of 
propagating 
their 
beliefs, 
which 
according 
to 
their 
dream 
were 
to 
renew 
the 
world. 


The 
religion 
thus 
founded 
had 
the 
force 
of 
other 
religions, 
if 
not 
their 
duration. 
Yet 
it 
did 
not 
perish 
without 
leaving 
indelible 
traces, 
and 
its 
influence 
is 
active 
still. 


We 
shall 
not 
consider 
the 
Revolution 
as 
a 
clean 
sweep 
in 
history, 
as 
its 
apostles 
believed 
it. 
We 
know 
that 
to 
demonstrate 
their 
intention 
of 
creating 
a 
world 
distinct 
from 
the 
old 
they 
initiated 
a 
new 
era 
and 
professed 
to 
break 
entirely 
with 
all 
vestiges 
of 
the 
past. 


But 
the 
past 
never 
dies. 
It 
is 
even 
more 
truly 
within 
us 
than 
without 
us. 
Against 
their 
will 
the 
reformers 
of 
the 
Revolution 
remained 
saturated 
with 
the 
past, 
and 
could 
only 
continue, 
under 
other 
names, 
the 
traditions 
of 
the 
monarchy, 
even 
exaggerating 
the 
autocracy 
and 
centralisation 
of 
the 
old 
system. 
Tocqueville 
had 
no 
difficulty 
in 
proving 
that 
the 
Revolution 
did 
little 
but 
overturn 
that 
which 
was 
about 
to 
fall. 


If 
in 
reality 
the 
Revolution 
destroyed 
but 
little 
it 
favoured 
the 
fruition 
of 
certain 
ideas 
which 
continued 
thenceforth 
to 
develop. 


The 
fraternity 
and 
liberty 
which 
it 
proclaimed 
never 
greatly 
seduced 
the 
peoples, 
but 
equality 
became 
their 
gospel: 
the 
pivot 
of 
socialism 
and 
of 
the 
entire 
evolution 
of 
modern 
democratic 
ideas. 
We 
may 
therefore 
say 
that 
the 
Revolution 
did 
not 
end 
with 
the 
advent 
of 
the 
Empire, 
nor 
with 
the 
successive 
restorations 
which 
followed 
it. 
Secretly 
or 
in 
the 
light 
of 
day 
it 
has 
slowly 
unrolled 
itself 
and 
still 
affects 
men's 
minds. 


The 
study 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution 
to 
which 
a 
great 
part 
of 
this 
book 
is 
devoted 
will 
perhaps 
deprive 
the 
reader 
of 
more 
than 
one 
illusion, 
by 
proving 
to 
him 
that 
the 
books 
which 
recount 
the 
history 
of 
the 
Revolution 
contain 
in 
reality 
a 
mass 
of 
legends 
very 
remote 
from 
reality. 


These 
legends 
will 
doubtless 
retain 
more 
life 
than 
history 
itself. 
Do 
not 
regret 
this 
too 
greatly. 
It 
may 
interest 
a 
few 
philosophers 
to 
know 
the 
truth, 
but 
the 
peoples 
will 
always 
prefer 
dreams. 
Synthetising 
their 
ideal, 
such 
dreams 
will 
always 
constitute 
powerful 
motives 
of 
action. 
One 
would 
lose 
courage 
were 
it 
not 
sustained 
by 
false 
ideas, 
said 
Fontenelle. 
Joan 
of 
Arc, 
the 
Giants 
of 
the 
Convention, 
the 
Imperial 
epic—all 
these 
dazzling 
images 
of 
the 



past 
will 
always 
remain 
sources 
of 
hope 
in 
the 
gloomy 
hours 
that 
follow 
defeat. 
They 
form 
part 
of 
that 
patrimony 
of 
illusions 
left 
us 
by 
our 
fathers, 
whose 
power 
is 
often 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
reality. 
The 
dream, 
the 
ideal, 
the 
legend—in 
a 
word, 
the 
unreal—it 
is 
that 
which 
shapes 
history.

PSYCHOLOGICAL

REVOLUTIONARY

GENERAL 
CHARACTERISTICS 
OF 
REVOLUTIONS 


CHAPTER 
I 


SCIENTIFIC 
AND 
POLITICAL 
REVOLUTIONS 


1. 
Classification 
of 
Revolutions. 
We 
generally 
apply 
the 
term 
revolution 
to 
sudden 
political 
changes, 
but 
the 
expression 
may 
be 
employed 
to 
denote 
all 
sudden 
transformations, 
or 
transformations 
apparently 
sudden, 
whether 
of 
beliefs, 
ideas, 
or 
doctrines. 


We 
have 
considered 
elsewhere 
the 
part 
played 
by 
the 
rational, 
affective, 
and 
mystic 
factors 
in 
the 
genesis 
of 
the 
opinions 
and 
beliefs 
which 
determine 
conduct. 
We 
need 
not 
therefore 
return 
to 
the 
subject 
here. 


A 
revolution 
may 
finally 
become 
a 
belief, 
but 
it 
often 
commences 
under 
the 
action 
of 
perfectly 
rational 
motives: 
the 
suppression 
of 
crying 
abuses, 
of 
a 
detested 
despotic 
government, 
or 
an 
unpopular 
sovereign, 
&c. 


Although 
the 
origin 
of 
a 
revolution 
may 
be 
perfectly 
rational, 
we 
must 
not 
forget 
that 
the 
reasons 
invoked 
in 
preparing 
for 
it 
do 
not 
influence 
the 
crowd 
until 
they 
have 
been 
transformed 
into 
sentiments. 
Rational 
logic 
can 
point 
to 
the 
abuses 
to 
be 
destroyed, 
but 
to 
move 
the 
multitude 
its 
hopes 
must 
be 
awakened. 
This 
can 
only 
be 
effected 
by 
the 
action 
of 
the 
affective 
and 
mystic 
elements 
which 
give 
man 
the 
power 
to 
act. 
At 
the 
time 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution, 
for 
example, 
rational 
logic, 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
philosophers, 
demonstrated 
the 
inconveniences 
of 
the 
ancien 
regime, 
and 
excited 
the 
desire 



to 
change 
it. 
Mystic 
logic 
inspired 
belief 
in 
the 
virtues 
of 
a 
society 
created 
in 
all 
its 
members 
according 
to 
certain 
principles. 
Affective 
logic 
unchained 
the 
passions 
confined 
by 
the 
bonds 
of 
ages 
and 
led 
to 
the 
worst 
excesses. 
Collective 
logic 
ruled 
the 
clubs 
and 
the 
Assemblies 
and 
impelled 
their 
members 
to 
actions 
which 
neither 
rational 
nor 
affective 
nor 
mystic 
logic 
would 
ever 
have 
caused 
them 
to 
commit. 


Whatever 
its 
origin, 
a 
revolution 
is 
not 
productive 
of 
results 
until 
it 
has 
sunk 
into 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
multitude. 
Then 
events 
acquire 
special 
forms 
resulting 
from 
the 
peculiar 
psychology 
of 
crowds. 
Popular 
movements 
for 
this 
reason 
have 
characteristics 
so 
pronounced 
that 
the 
description 
of 
one 
will 
enable 
us 
to 
comprehend 
the 
others. 


The 
multitude 
is, 
therefore, 
the 
agent 
of 
a 
revolution; 
but 
not 
its 
point 
of 
departure. 
The 
crowd 
represents 
an 
amorphous 
being 
which 
can 
do 
nothing, 
and 
will 
nothing, 
without 
a 
head 
to 
lead 
it. 
It 
will 
quickly 
exceed 
the 
impulse 
once 
received, 
but 
it 
never 
creates 
it. 


The 
sudden 
political 
revolutions 
which 
strike 
the 
historian 
most 
forcibly 
are 
often 
the 
least 
important. 
The 
great 
revolutions 
are 
those 
of 
manners 
and 
thought. 
Changing 
the 
name 
of 
a 
government 
does 
not 
transform 
the 
mentality 
of 
a 
people. 
To 
overthrow 
the 
institutions 
of 
a 
people 
is 
not 
to 
reshape 
its 
soul. 


The 
true 
revolutions, 
those 
which 
transform 
the 
destinies 
of 
the 
peoples, 
are 
most 
frequently 
accomplished 
so 
slowly 
that 
the 
historians 
can 
hardly 
point 
to 
their 
beginnings. 
The 
term 
evolution 
is, 
therefore, 
far 
more 
appropriate 
than 
revolution. 


The 
various 
elements 
we 
have 
enumerated 
as 
entering 
into 
the 
genesis 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
revolutions 
will 
not 
suffice 
to 
classify 
them. 
Considering 
only 
the 
designed 
object, 
we 
will 
divide 
them 
into 
scientific 
revolutions, 
political 
revolutions, 
and 
religious 
revolutions. 


2. 
Scientific 
Revolutions. 
Scientific 
revolutions 
are 
by 
far 
the 
most 
important. 
Although 
they 
attract 
but 
little 
attention, 
they 
are 
often 
fraught 
with 
remote 
consequences, 
such 
as 
are 
not 
engendered 
by 
political 
revolutions. 
We 
will 
therefore 
put 
them 
first, 
although 
we 
cannot 
study 
them 
here. 


For 
instance, 
if 
our 
conceptions 
of 
the 
universe 
have 
profoundly 
changed 
since 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
it 
is 
because 
astronomical 
discoveries 
and 



the 
application 
of 
experimental 
methods 
have 
revolutionised 
them, 
by 
demonstrating 
that 
phenomena, 
instead 
of 
being 
conditioned 
by 
the 
caprices 
of 
the 
gods, 
are 
ruled 
by 
invariable 
laws. 


Such 
revolutions 
are 
fittingly 
spoken 
of 
as 
evolution, 
on 
account 
of 
their 
slowness. 
But 
there 
are 
others 
which, 
although 
of 
the 
same 
order, 
deserve 
the 
name 
of 
revolution 
by 
reason 
of 
their 
rapidity: 
we 
may 
instance 
the 
theories 
of 
Darwin, 
overthrowing 
the 
whole 
science 
of 
biology 
in 
a 
few 
years; 
the 
discoveries 
of 
Pasteur, 
which 
revolutionised 
medicine 
during 
the 
lifetime 
of 
their 
author; 
and 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
dissociation 
of 
matter, 
proving 
that 
the 
atom, 
formerly 
supposed 
to 
be 
eternal, 
is 
not 
immune 
from 
the 
laws 
which 
condemn 
all 
the 
elements 
of 
the 
universe 
to 
decline 
and 
perish. 


These 
scientific 
revolutions 
in 
the 
domain 
of 
ideas 
are 
purely 
intellectual. 
Our 
sentiments 
and 
beliefs 
do 
not 
affect 
them. 
Men 
submit 
to 
them 
without 
discussing 
them. 
Their 
results 
being 
controllable 
by 
experience, 
they 
escape 
all 
criticism. 


3. 
Political 
Revolutions. 
Beneath 
and 
very 
remote 
from 
these 
scientific 
revolutions, 
which 
generate 
the 
progress 
of 
civilisations, 
are 
the 
religious 
and 
political 
revolutions, 
which 
have 
no 
kinship 
with 
them. 
While 
scientific 
revolutions 
derive 
solely 
from 
rational 
elements, 
political 
and 
religious 
beliefs 
are 
sustained 
almost 
exclusively 
by 
affective 
and 
mystic 
factors. 
Reason 
plays 
only 
a 
feeble 
part 
in 
their 
genesis. 


I 
insisted 
at 
some 
length 
in 
my 
book 
Opinions 
and 
Beliefs 
on 
the 
affective 
and 
mystic 
origin 
of 
beliefs, 
showing 
that 
a 
political 
or 
religious 
belief 
constitutes 
an 
act 
of 
faith 
elaborated 
in 
unconsciousness, 
over 
which, 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
appearances, 
reason 
has 
no 
hold. 
I 
also 
showed 
that 
belief 
often 
reaches 
such 
a 
degree 
of 
intensity 
that 
nothing 
can 
be 
opposed 
to 
it. 
The 
man 
hypnotised 
by 
his 
faith 
becomes 
an 
Apostle, 
ready 
to 
sacrifice 
his 
interests, 
his 
happiness, 
and 
even 
his 
life 
for 
the 
triumph 
of 
his 
faith. 
The 
absurdity 
of 
his 
belief 
matters 
little; 
for 
him 
it 
is 
a 
burning 
reality. 
Certitudes 
of 
mystic 
origin 
possess 
the 
marvellous 
power 
of 
entire 
domination 
over 
thought, 
and 
can 
only 
be 
affected 
by 
time. 


By 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
it 
is 
regarded 
as 
an 
absolute 
truth 
a 
belief 
necessarily 
becomes 
intolerant. 
This 
explains 
the 
violence, 
hatred, 
and 
persecution 
which 



were 
the 
habitual 
accompaniments 
of 
the 
great 
political 
and 
religious 
revolutions, 
notably 
of 
the 
Reformation 
and 
the 
French 
Revolution. 


Certain 
periods 
of 
French 
history 
remain 
incomprehensible 
if 
we 
forget 
the 
affective 
and 
mystic 
origin 
of 
beliefs, 
their 
necessary 
intolerance, 
the 
impossibility 
of 
reconciling 
them 
when 
they 
come 
into 
mutual 
contact, 
and, 
finally, 
the 
power 
conferred 
by 
mystic 
beliefs 
upon 
the 
sentiments 
which 
place 
themselves 
at 
their 
service. 


The 
foregoing 
conceptions 
are 
too 
novel 
as 
yet 
to 
have 
modified 
the 
mentality 
of 
the 
historians. 
They 
will 
continue 
to 
attempt 
to 
explain, 
by 
means 
of 
rational 
logic, 
a 
host 
of 
phenomena 
which 
are 
foreign 
to 
it. 


Events 
such 
as 
the 
Reformation, 
which 
overwhelmed 
France 
for 
a 
period 
of 
fifty 
years, 
were 
in 
no 
wise 
determined 
by 
rational 
influences. 
Yet 
rational 
influences 
are 
always 
invoked 
in 
explanation, 
even 
in 
the 
most 
recent 
works. 
Thus, 
in 
the 
General 
History 
of 
Messrs. 
Lavisse 
and 
Rambaud, 
we 
read 
the 
following 
explanation 
of 
the 
Reformation:— 


``It 
was 
a 
spontaneous 
movement, 
born 
here 
and 
there 
amidst 
the 
people, 
from 
the 
reading 
of 
the 
Gospels 
and 
the 
free 
individual 
reflections 
which 
were 
suggested 
to 
simple 
persons 
by 
an 
extremely 
pious 
conscience 
and 
a 
very 
bold 
reasoning 
power.'' 


Contrary 
to 
the 
assertion 
of 
these 
historians, 
we 
may 
say 
with 
certainty, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
that 
such 
movements 
are 
never 
spontaneous, 
and 
secondly, 
that 
reason 
takes 
no 
part 
in 
their 
elaboration. 


The 
force 
of 
the 
political 
and 
religious 
beliefs 
which 
have 
moved 
the 
world 
resides 
precisely 
in 
the 
fact 
that, 
being 
born 
of 
affective 
and 
mystic 
elements, 
they 
are 
neither 
created 
nor 
directed 
by 
reason. 


Political 
or 
religious 
beliefs 
have 
a 
common 
origin 
and 
obey 
the 
same 
laws. 
They 
are 
formed 
not 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
reason, 
but 
more 
often 
contrary 
to 
all 
reason. 
Buddhism, 
Islamism, 
the 
Reformation, 
Jacobinism, 
Socialism, 
&c., 
seem 
very 
different 
forms 
of 
thought. 
Yet 
they 
have 
identical 
affective 
and 
mystic 
bases, 
and 
obey 
a 
logic 
that 
has 
no 
affinity 
with 
rational 
logic. 


Political 
revolutions 
may 
result 
from 
beliefs 
established 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
men, 
but 
many 
other 
causes 
produce 
them. 
The 
word 
discontent 
sums 
them 
up. 
As 
soon 
as 
discontent 
is 
generalised 
a 
party 
is 
formed 
which 
often 
becomes 
strong 
enough 
to 
struggle 
against 
the 
Government. 


Discontent 
must 
generally 
have 
been 
accumulating 
for 
a 
long 
time 
in 
order 
to 
produce 
its 
effects. 
For 
this 
reason 
a 
revolution 
does 
not 
always 
represent 
a 
phenomenon 
in 
process 
of 
termination 
followed 
by 
another 
which 



is 
commencing 
but 
rather 
a 
continuous 
phenomenon, 
having 
somewhat 
accelerated 
its 
evolution. 
All 
the 
modern 
revolutions, 
however, 
have 
been 
abrupt 
movements, 
entailing 
the 
instantaneous 
overthrow 
of 
governments. 
Such, 
for 
example, 
were 
the 
Brazilian, 
Portuguese, 
Turkish, 
and 
Chinese 
revolutions. 


To 
the 
contrary 
of 
what 
might 
be 
supposed, 
the 
very 
conservative 
peoples 
are 
addicted 
to 
the 
most 
violent 
revolutions. 
Being 
conservative, 
they 
are 
not 
able 
to 
evolve 
slowly, 
or 
to 
adapt 
themselves 
to 
variations 
of 
environment, 
so 
that 
when 
the 
discrepancy 
becomes 
too 
extreme 
they 
are 
bound 
to 
adapt 
themselves 
suddenly. 
This 
sudden 
evolution 
constitutes 
a 
revolution. 


Peoples 
able 
to 
adapt 
themselves 
progressively 
do 
not 
always 
escape 
revolution. 
It 
was 
only 
by 
means 
of 
a 
revolution 
that 
the 
English, 
in 
1688, 
were 
able 
to 
terminate 
the 
struggle 
which 
had 
dragged 
on 
for 
a 
century 
between 
the 
monarchy, 
which 
sought 
to 
make 
itself 
absolute, 
and 
the 
nation, 
which 
claimed 
the 
right 
to 
govern 
itself 
through 
the 
medium 
of 
its 
representatives. 


The 
great 
revolutions 
have 
usually 
commenced 
from 
the 
top, 
not 
from 
the 
bottom; 
but 
once 
the 
people 
is 
unchained 
it 
is 
to 
the 
people 
that 
revolution 
owes 
its 
might. 


It 
is 
obvious 
that 
revolutions 
have 
never 
taken 
place, 
and 
will 
never 
take 
place, 
save 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
an 
important 
fraction 
of 
the 
army. 
Royalty 
did 
not 
disappear 
in 
France 
on 
the 
day 
when 
Louis 
XVI. 
was 
guillotined, 
but 
at 
the 
precise 
moment 
when 
his 
mutinous 
troops 
refused 
to 
defend 
him. 


It 
is 
more 
particularly 
by 
mental 
contagion 
that 
armies 
become 
disaffected, 
being 
indifferent 
enough 
at 
heart 
to 
the 
established 
order 
of 
things. 
As 
soon 
as 
the 
coalition 
of 
a 
few 
officers 
had 
succeeded 
in 
overthrowing 
the 
Turkish 
Government 
the 
Greek 
officers 
thought 
to 
imitate 
them 
and 
to 
change 
their 
government, 
although 
there 
was 
no 
analogy 
between 
the 
two 
regimes. 


A 
military 
movement 
may 
overthrow 
a 
government—and 
in 
the 
Spanish 
republics 
the 
Government 
is 
hardly 
ever 
destroyed 
by 
any 
other 
means—but 
if 
the 
revolution 
is 
to 
be 
productive 
of 
great 
results 
it 
must 
always 
be 
based 
upon 
general 
discontent 
and 
general 
hopes. 


Unless 
it 
is 
universal 
and 
excessive, 
discontent 
alone 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
bring 
about 
a 
revolution. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
lead 
a 
handful 
of 
men 
to 
pillage, 
destroy, 
and 
massacre, 
but 
to 
raise 
a 
whole 
people, 
or 
any 
great 
portion 
of 
that 
people, 
calls 
for 
the 
continuous 
or 
repeated 
action 
of 
leaders. 
These 



exaggerate 
the 
discontent; 
they 
persuade 
the 
discontented 
that 
the 
government 
is 
the 
sole 
cause 
of 
all 
the 
trouble, 
especially 
of 
the 
prevailing 
dearth, 
and 
assure 
men 
that 
the 
new 
system 
proposed 
by 
them 
will 
engender 
an 
age 
of 
felicity. 
These 
ideas 
germinate, 
propagating 
themselves 
by 
suggestion 
and 
contagion, 
and 
the 
moment 
arrives 
when 
the 
revolution 
is 
ripe. 


In 
this 
fashion 
the 
Christian 
Revolution 
and 
the 
French 
Revolution 
were 
prepared. 
That 
the 
latter 
was 
effected 
in 
a 
few 
years, 
while 
the 
first 
required 
many, 
was 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
French 
Revolution 
promptly 
had 
an 
armed 
force 
at 
its 
disposal, 
while 
Christianity 
was 
long 
in 
winning 
material 
power. 
In 
the 
beginning 
its 
only 
adepts 
were 
the 
lowly, 
the 
poor, 
and 
the 
slaves, 
filled 
with 
enthusiasm 
by 
the 
prospect 
of 
seeing 
their 
miserable 
life 
transformed 
into 
an 
eternity 
of 
delight. 
By 
a 
phenomenon 
of 
contagion 
from 
below, 
of 
which 
history 
affords 
us 
more 
than 
one 
example, 
the 
doctrine 
finally 
invaded 
the 
upper 
strata 
of 
the 
nation, 
but 
it 
was 
a 
long 
time 
before 
an 
emperor 
considered 
the 
new 
faith 
sufficiently 
widespread 
to 
be 
adopted 
as 
the 
official 
religion. 


4. 
The 
Results 
of 
Political 
Revolutions. 
When 
a 
political 
party 
is 
triumphant 
it 
naturally 
seeks 
to 
organise 
society 
in 
accordance 
with 
its 
interests. 
The 
organisation 
will 
differ 
accordingly 
as 
the 
revolution 
has 
been 
effected 
by 
the 
soldiers, 
the 
Radicals, 
or 
the 
Conservatives, 
&c. 


The 
new 
laws 
and 
institutions 
will 
depend 
on 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
triumphant 
party 
and 
of 
the 
classes 
which 
have 
assisted 
it—the 
clergy 
for 
instance. 


If 
the 
revolution 
has 
triumphed 
only 
after 
a 
violent 
struggle, 
as 
was 
the 
case 
with 
the 
French 
Revolution, 
the 
victors 
will 
reject 
at 
one 
sweep 
the 
whole 
arsenal 
of 
the 
old 
law. 
The 
supporters 
of 
the 
fallen 
regime 
will 
be 
persecuted, 
exiled, 
or 
exterminated. 


The 
maximum 
of 
violence 
in 
these 
persecutions 
is 
attained 
when 
the 
triumphant 
party 
is 
defending 
a 
belief 
in 
addition 
to 
its 
material 
interests. 
Then 
the 
conquered 
need 
hope 
for 
no 
pity. 
Thus 
may 
be 
explained 
the 
expulsion 
of 
the 
Moors 
from 
Spain, 
the 
autodafes 
of 
the 
Inquisition, 
the 
executions 
of 
the 
Convention, 
and 
the 
recent 
laws 
against 
the 
religious 



congregations 
in 
France. 


The 
absolute 
power 
which 
is 
assumed 
by 
the 
victors 
leads 
them 
sometimes 
to 
extreme 
measures, 
such 
as 
the 
Convention's 
decree 
that 
gold 
was 
to 
be 
replaced 
by 
paper, 
that 
goods 
were 
to 
be 
sold 
at 
determined 
prices, 
&c. 
Very 
soon 
it 
runs 
up 
against 
a 
wall 
of 
unavoidable 
necessities, 
which 
turn 
opinion 
against 
its 
tyranny, 
and 
finally 
leave 
it 
defenceless 
before 
attack, 
as 
befell 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution. 
The 
same 
thing 
happened 
recently 
to 
a 
Socialist 
Australian 
ministry 
composed 
almost 
exclusively 
of 
workingmen. 
It 
enacted 
laws 
so 
absurd, 
and 
accorded 
such 
privileges 
to 
the 
trade 
unions, 
that 
public 
opinion 
rebelled 
against 
it 
so 
unanimously 
that 
in 
three 
months 
it 
was 
overthrown. 


But 
the 
cases 
we 
have 
considered 
are 
exceptional. 
The 
majority 
of 
revolutions 
have 
been 
accomplished 
in 
order 
to 
place 
a 
new 
sovereign 
in 
power. 
Now 
this 
sovereign 
knows 
very 
well 
that 
the 
first 
condition 
of 
maintaining 
his 
power 
consists 
in 
not 
too 
exclusively 
favouring 
a 
single 
class, 
but 
in 
seeking 
to 
conciliate 
all. 
To 
do 
this 
he 
will 
establish 
a 
sort 
of 
equilibrium 
between 
them, 
so 
as 
not 
to 
be 
dominated 
by 
any 
one 
of 
these 
classes. 
To 
allow 
one 
class 
to 
become 
predominant 
is 
to 
condemn 
himself 
presently 
to 
accept 
that 
class 
as 
his 
master. 
This 
law 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
certain 
of 
political 
psychology. 
The 
kings 
of 
France 
understood 
it 
very 
well 
when 
they 
struggled 
so 
energetically 
against 
the 
encroachments 
first 
of 
the 
nobility 
and 
then 
of 
the 
clergy. 
If 
they 
had 
not 
done 
so 
their 
fate 
would 
have 
been 
that 
of 
the 
German 
Emperors 
of 
the 
Middle 
Ages, 
who, 
excommunicated 
by 
the 
Pope, 
were 
reduced, 
like 
Henry 
IV. 
at 
Canossa, 
to 
make 
a 
pilgrimage 
and 
humbly 
to 
sue 
for 
the 
Pope's 
forgiveness. 


This 
same 
law 
has 
continually 
been 
verified 
during 
the 
course 
of 
history. 
When 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Roman 
Empire 
the 
military 
caste 
became 
preponderant, 
the 
emperors 
depended 
entirely 
upon 
their 
soldiers, 
who 
appointed 
and 
deposed 
them 
at 
will. 


It 
was 
therefore 
a 
great 
advantage 
for 
France 
that 
she 
was 
so 
long 
governed 
by 
a 
monarch 
almost 
absolute, 
supposed 
to 
hold 
his 
power 
by 
divine 
right, 
and 
surrounded 
therefore 
by 
a 
considerable 
prestige. 
Without 
such 
an 
authority 
he 
could 
have 
controlled 
neither 
the 
feudal 
nobility, 
nor 
the 
clergy, 
nor 
the 
parliaments. 
If 
Poland, 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
the 
sixteenth 
century, 
had 
also 
possessed 
an 
absolute 
and 
respected 
monarchy, 
she 
would 
not 
have 
descended 
the 
path 
of 
decadence 
which 
led 
to 
her 
disappearance 
from 
the 
map 
of 
Europe. 



We 
have 
shewn 
in 
this 
chapter 
that 
political 
revolutions 
may 
be 
accompanied 
by 
important 
social 
transformations. 
We 
shall 
soon 
see 
how 
slight 
are 
these 
transformations 
compared 
to 
those 
produced 
by 
religious 
revolutions. 


CHAPTER 
II 


RELIGIOUS 
REVOLUTIONS 


1. 
The 
importance 
of 
the 
study 
of 
Religious 
Revolutions 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
comprehension 
of 
the 
great 
Political 
Revolutions. 
A 
portion 
of 
this 
work 
will 
be 
devoted 
to 
the 
French 
Revolution. 
It 
was 
full 
of 
acts 
of 
violence 
which 
naturally 
had 
their 
psychological 
causes. 


These 
exceptional 
events 
will 
always 
fill 
us 
with 
astonishment, 
and 
we 
even 
feel 
them 
to 
be 
inexplicable. 
They 
become 
comprehensible, 
however, 
if 
we 
consider 
that 
the 
French 
Revolution, 
constituting 
a 
new 
religion, 
was 
bound 
to 
obey 
the 
laws 
which 
condition 
the 
propagation 
of 
all 
beliefs. 
Its 
fury 
and 
its 
hecatombs 
will 
then 
become 
intelligible. 


In 
studying 
the 
history 
of 
a 
great 
religious 
revolution, 
that 
of 
the 
Reformation, 
we 
shall 
see 
that 
a 
number 
of 
psychological 
elements 
which 
figured 
therein 
were 
equally 
active 
during 
the 
French 
Revolution. 
In 
both 
we 
observe 
the 
insignificant 
bearing 
of 
the 
rational 
value 
of 
a 
belief 
upon 
its 
propagation, 
the 
inefficacy 
of 
persecution, 
the 
impossibility 
of 
tolerance 
between 
contrary 
beliefs, 
and 
the 
violence 
and 
the 
desperate 
struggles 
resulting 
from 
the 
conflict 
of 
different 
faiths. 
We 
also 
observe 
the 
exploitation 
of 
a 
belief 
by 
interests 
quite 
independent 
of 
that 
belief. 
Finally 
we 
see 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
modify 
the 
convictions 
of 
men 
without 
also 
modifying 
their 
existence. 


These 
phenomena 
verified, 
we 
shall 
see 
plainly 
why 
the 
gospel 
of 
the 
Revolution 
was 
propagated 
by 
the 
same 
methods 
as 
all 
the 
religious 
gospels, 
notably 
that 
of 
Calvin. 
It 
could 
not 
have 
been 
propagated 
otherwise. 


But 
although 
there 
are 
close 
analogies 
between 
the 
genesis 
of 
a 
religious 
revolution, 
such 
as 
the 
Reformation, 
and 
that 
of 
a 
great 
political 
revolution 



like 
our 
own, 
their 
remote 
consequences 
are 
very 
different, 
which 
explains 
the 
difference 
of 
duration 
which 
they 
display. 
In 
religious 
revolutions 
no 
experience 
can 
reveal 
to 
the 
faithful 
that 
they 
are 
deceived, 
since 
they 
would 
have 
to 
go 
to 
heaven 
to 
make 
the 
discovery. 
In 
political 
revolutions 
experience 
quickly 
demonstrates 
the 
error 
of 
a 
false 
doctrine 
and 
forces 
men 
to 
abandon 
it. 


Thus 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Directory 
the 
application 
of 
Jacobin 
beliefs 
had 
led 
France 
to 
such 
a 
degree 
of 
ruin, 
poverty, 
and 
despair 
that 
the 
wildest 
Jacobins 
themselves 
had 
to 
renounce 
their 
system. 
Nothing 
survived 
of 
their 
theories 
except 
a 
few 
principles 
which 
cannot 
be 
verified 
by 
experience, 
such 
as 
the 
universal 
happiness 
which 
equality 
should 
bestow 
upon 
humanity. 


2. 
The 
beginnings 
of 
the 
Reformation 
and 
its 
first 
disciples. 
The 
Reformation 
was 
finally 
to 
exercise 
a 
profound 
influence 
upon 
the 
sentiments 
and 
moral 
ideas 
of 
a 
great 
proportion 
of 
mankind. 
Modest 
in 
its 
beginnings, 
it 
was 
at 
first 
a 
simple 
struggle 
against 
the 
abuses 
of 
the 
clergy, 
and, 
from 
a 
practical 
point 
of 
view, 
a 
return 
to 
the 
prescriptions 
of 
the 
Gospel. 
It 
never 
constituted, 
as 
has 
been 
claimed, 
an 
aspiration 
towards 
freedom 
of 
thought. 
Calvin 
was 
as 
intolerant 
as 
Robespierre, 
and 
all 
the 
theorists 
of 
the 
age 
considered 
that 
the 
religion 
of 
subjects 
must 
be 
that 
of 
the 
prince 
who 
governed 
them. 
Indeed 
in 
every 
country 
where 
the 
Reformation 
was 
established 
the 
sovereign 
replaced 
the 
Pope 
of 
Rome, 
with 
the 
same 
rights 
and 
the 
same 
powers. 


In 
France, 
in 
default 
of 
publicity 
and 
means 
of 
communication, 
the 
new 
faith 
spread 
slowly 
enough 
at 
first. 
It 
was 
about 
1520 
that 
Luther 
recruited 
a 
few 
adepts, 
and 
only 
towards 
1535 
was 
the 
new 
belief 
sufficiently 
widespread 
for 
men 
to 
consider 
it 
necessary 
to 
burn 
its 
disciples. 


In 
conformity 
with 
a 
well-known 
psychological 
law, 
these 
executions 
merely 
favoured 
the 
propagation 
of 
the 
Reformation. 
Its 
first 
followers 
included 
priests 
and 
magistrates, 
but 
were 
principally 
obscure 
artisans. 
Their 
conversion 
was 
effected 
almost 
exclusively 
by 
mental 
contagion 
and 
suggestion. 


As 
soon 
as 
a 
new 
belief 
extends 
itself, 
we 
see 
grouped 
round 
it 
many 
persons 
who 
are 
indifferent 
to 
the 
belief, 
but 
who 
find 
in 
it 
a 
pretext 
or 
opportunity 
for 
gratifying 
their 
passions 
or 
their 
greed. 
This 
phenomenon 
was 



observed 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Reformation 
in 
many 
countries, 
notably 
in 
Germany 
and 
in 
England. 


Luther 
having 
taught 
that 
the 
clergy 
had 
no 
need 
of 
wealth, 
the 
German 
lords 
found 
many 
merits 
in 
a 
faith 
which 
enabled 
them 
to 
seize 
upon 
the 
goods 
of 
the 
Church. 
Henry 
VIII. 
enriched 
himself 
by 
a 
similar 
operation. 
Sovereigns 
who 
were 
often 
molested 
by 
the 
Pope 
could 
as 
a 
rule 
only 
look 
favourably 
upon 
a 
doctrine 
which 
added 
religious 
powers 
to 
their 
political 
powers 
and 
made 
each 
of 
them 
a 
Pope. 
Far 
from 
diminishing 
the 
absolutism 
of 
rulers, 
the 
Reformation 
only 
exaggerated 
it. 


3. 
Rational 
value 
of 
the 
doctrines 
of 
the 
Reformation. 
The 
Reformation 
overturned 
all 
Europe, 
and 
came 
near 
to 
ruining 
France, 
of 
which 
it 
made 
a 
battle-field 
for 
a 
period 
of 
fifty 
years. 
Never 
did 
a 
cause 
so 
insignificant 
from 
the 
rational 
point 
of 
view 
produce 
such 
great 
results. 


Here 
is 
one 
of 
the 
innumerable 
proofs 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
beliefs 
are 
propagated 
independently 
of 
all 
reason. 
The 
theological 
doctrines 
which 
aroused 
men's 
passions 
so 
violently, 
and 
notably 
those 
of 
Calvin, 
are 
not 
even 
worthy 
of 
examination 
in 
the 
light 
of 
rational 
logic. 


Greatly 
concerned 
about 
his 
salvation, 
having 
an 
excessive 
fear 
of 
the 
devil, 
which 
his 
confessor 
was 
unable 
to 
allay, 
Luther 
sought 
the 
surest 
means 
of 
pleasing 
God 
that 
he 
might 
avoid 
Hell. 


Having 
commenced 
by 
denying 
the 
Pope 
the 
right 
to 
sell 
indulgences, 
he 
presently 
entirely 
denied 
his 
authority, 
and 
that 
of 
the 
Church, 
condemned 
religious 
ceremonies, 
confession, 
and 
the 
worship 
of 
the 
saints, 
and 
declared 
that 
Christians 
should 
have 
no 
rules 
of 
conduct 
other 
than 
the 
Bible. 
He 
also 
considered 
that 
no 
one 
could 
be 
saved 
without 
the 
grace 
of 
God. 


This 
last 
theory, 
known 
as 
that 
of 
predestination, 
was 
in 
Luther 
rather 
uncertain, 
but 
was 
stated 
precisely 
by 
Calvin, 
who 
made 
it 
the 
very 
foundation 
of 
a 
doctrine 
to 
which 
the 
majority 
of 
Protestants 
are 
still 
subservient. 
According 
to 
him: 
``From 
all 
eternity 
God 
has 
predestined 
certain 
men 
to 
be 
burned 
and 
others 
to 
be 
saved.'' 
Why 
this 
monstrous 
iniquity? 
Simply 
because 
``it 
is 
the 
will 
of 
God.'' 


Thus 
according 
to 
Calvin, 
who 
for 
that 
matter 
merely 
developed 
certain 
assertions 
of 
St. 
Augustine, 
an 
all-powerful 
God 
would 
amuse 
Himself 
by 
creating 
living 
beings 
simply 
in 
order 
to 
burn 
them 
during 
all 
eternity, 



without 
paying 
any 
heed 
to 
their 
acts 
or 
merits. 
It 
is 
marvellous 
that 
such 
revolting 
insanity 
could 
for 
such 
a 
length 
of 
time 
subjugate 
so 
many 
minds— 
marvellous 
that 
it 
does 
so 
still.[1] 


[1] 
The 
doctrine 
of 
predestination 
is 
still 
taught 
in 
Protestant 
catechisms, 
as 
is 
proved 
by 
the 
following 
passage 
extracted 
from 
the 
last 
edition 
of 
an 
official 
catechism 
for 
which 
I 
sent 
to 
Edinburgh: 
``By 
the 
decree 
of 
God, 
for 
the 
manifestation 
of 
His 
glory, 
some 
men 
and 
angels 
are 
predestinated 
unto 
everlasting 
life, 
and 
others 
foreordained 
to 
everlasting 
death. 


``These 
angels 
and 
men, 
thus 
predestinated 
and 
foreordained, 
are 
particularly 
and 
unchangeably 
designed; 
and 
their 
number 
is 
so 
certain 
and 
definite 
that 
it 
cannot 
be 
either 
increased 
or 
diminished. 


``Those 
of 
mankind 
that 
are 
predestinated 
unto 
life, 
God, 
before 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
world 
was 
laid, 
according 
to 
His 
eternal 
and 
immutable 
purpose, 
and 
the 
secret 
counsel 
and 
good 
pleasure 
of 
His 
will, 
hath 
chosen 
in 
Christ 
unto 
everlasting 
glory, 
out 
of 
His 
mere 
free 
grace 
and 
love, 
without 
any 
foresight 
of 
faith 
or 
good 
works, 
or 
perseverance 
in 
either 
of 
them, 
or 
any 
other 
thing 
in 
the 
creature, 
as 
conditions, 
or 
causes 
moving 
him 
thereunto; 
and 
all 
to 
the 
praise 
of 
his 
glorious 
grace. 


``As 
God 
hath 
appointed 
the 
elect 
unto 
glory, 
so 
hath 
He, 
by 
the 
eternal 
and 
most 
free 
purpose 
of 
His 
will, 
foreordained 
all 
the 
means 
thereunto. 
Wherefore 
they 
who 
are 
elected 
being 
fallen 
in 
Adam, 
are 
redeemed 
by 
Christ; 
are 
effectually 
called 
unto 
faith 
in 
Christ 
by 
His 
spirit 
working 
in 
due 
season; 
are 
justified, 
adopted, 
sanctified, 
and 
kept 
by 
His 
power 
through 
faith 
unto 
salvation. 
Neither 
are 
any 
other 
redeemed 
by 
Christ, 
effectually 
called, 
justified, 
adopted, 
sanctified, 
and 
saved, 
but 
the 
elect 
only.'' 


The 
psychology 
of 
Calvin 
is 
not 
without 
affinity 
with 
that 
of 
Robespierre. 
Like 
the 
latter, 
the 
master 
of 
the 
pure 
truth, 
he 
sent 
to 
death 
those 
who 
would 
not 
accept 
his 
doctrines. 
God, 
he 
stated, 
wishes 
``that 
one 
should 
put 
aside 
all 
humanity 
when 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
striving 
for 
his 
glory.'' 


The 
case 
of 
Calvin 
and 
his 
disciples 
shows 
that 
matters 
which 
rationally 
are 
the 
most 
contradictory 
become 
perfectly 
reconciled 
in 
minds 
which 
are 



hypnotised 
by 
a 
belief. 
In 
the 
eyes 
of 
rational 
logic, 
it 
seems 
impossible 
to 
base 
a 
morality 
upon 
the 
theory 
of 
predestination, 
since 
whatever 
they 
do 
men 
are 
sure 
of 
being 
either 
saved 
or 
damned. 
However, 
Calvin 
had 
no 
difficulty 
in 
erecting 
a 
most 
severe 
morality 
upon 
this 
totally 
illogical 
basis. 
Considering 
themselves 
the 
elect 
of 
God, 
his 
disciples 
were 
so 
swollen 
by 
pride 
and 
the 
sense 
of 
their 
own 
dignity 
that 
they 
felt 
obliged 
to 
serve 
as 
models 
in 
their 
conduct. 


4. 
Propagation 
of 
the 
Reformation. 
The 
new 
faith 
was 
propagated 
not 
by 
speech, 
still 
less 
by 
process 
of 
reasoning, 
but 
by 
the 
mechanism 
described 
in 
our 
preceding 
work: 
that 
is, 
by 
the 
influence 
of 
affirmation, 
repetition, 
mental 
contagion, 
and 
prestige. 
At 
a 
much 
later 
date 
revolutionary 
ideas 
were 
spread 
over 
France 
in 
the 
same 
fashion. 


Persecution, 
as 
we 
have 
already 
remarked, 
only 
favoured 
this 
propagation. 
Each 
execution 
led 
to 
fresh 
conversions, 
as 
was 
seen 
in 
the 
early 
years 
of 
the 
Christian 
Church. 
Anne 
Dubourg, 
Parliamentary 
councillor, 
condemned 
to 
be 
burned 
alive, 
marched 
to 
the 
stake 
exhorting 
the 
crowd 
to 
be 
converted. 
``His 
constancy,'' 
says 
a 
witness, 
``made 
more 
Protestants 
among 
the 
young 
men 
of 
the 
colleges 
than 
the 
books 
of 
Calvin.'' 


To 
prevent 
the 
condemned 
from 
speaking 
to 
the 
people 
their 
tongues 
were 
cut 
out 
before 
they 
were 
burned. 
The 
horror 
of 
their 
sufferings 
was 
increased 
by 
attaching 
the 
victims 
to 
an 
iron 
chain, 
which 
enabled 
the 
executioners 
to 
plunge 
them 
into 
the 
fire 
and 
withdraw 
them 
several 
times 
in 
succession. 


But 
nothing 
induced 
the 
Protestants 
to 
retract, 
even 
the 
offer 
of 
an 
amnesty 
after 
they 
had 
felt 
the 
fire. 


In 
1535 
Francis 
I., 
forsaking 
his 
previous 
tolerance, 
ordered 
six 
fires 
to 
be 
lighted 
simultaneously 
in 
Paris. 
The 
Convention, 
as 
we 
know, 
limited 
itself 
to 
a 
single 
guillotine 
in 
the 
same 
city. 
It 
is 
probable 
that 
the 
sufferings 
of 
the 
victims 
were 
not 
very 
excruciating; 
the 
insensibility 
of 
the 
Christian 
martyrs 
had 
already 
been 
remarked. 
Believers 
are 
hypnotised 
by 
their 
faith, 
and 
we 
know 
to-day 
that 
certain 
forms 
of 
hypnotism 
engender 
complete 
insensibility. 


The 
new 
faith 
progressed 
rapidly. 
In 
1560 
there 
were 
two 
thousand 
reformed 
churches 
in 
France, 
and 
many 
great 
lords, 
at 
first 
indifferent 



enough, 
adhered 
to 
the 
new 
doctrine. 


5. 
Conflict 
between 
different 
religious 
beliefs—Impossibility 
of 
Tolerance. 
I 
have 
already 
stated 
that 
intolerance 
is 
always 
an 
accompaniment 
of 
powerful 
religious 
beliefs. 
Political 
and 
religious 
revolutions 
furnish 
us 
with 
numerous 
proofs 
of 
this 
fact, 
and 
show 
us 
also 
that 
the 
mutual 
intolerance 
of 
sectaries 
of 
the 
same 
religion 
is 
always 
much 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
the 
defenders 
of 
remote 
and 
alien 
faiths, 
such 
as 
Islamism 
and 
Christianity. 
In 
fact, 
if 
we 
consider 
the 
faiths 
for 
whose 
sake 
France 
was 
so 
long 
rent 
asunder, 
we 
shall 
find 
that 
they 
did 
not 
differ 
on 
any 
but 
accessory 
points. 
Catholics 
and 
Protestants 
adored 
exactly 
the 
same 
God, 
and 
only 
differed 
in 
their 
manner 
of 
adoring 
Him. 
If 
reason 
had 
played 
the 
smallest 
part 
in 
the 
elaboration 
of 
their 
belief, 
it 
could 
easily 
have 
proved 
to 
them 
that 
it 
must 
be 
quite 
indifferent 
to 
God 
whether 
He 
sees 
men 
adore 
Him 
in 
this 
fashion 
or 
in 
that. 


Reason 
being 
powerless 
to 
affect 
the 
brain 
of 
the 
convinced, 
Protestants 
and 
Catholics 
continued 
their 
ferocious 
conflicts. 
All 
the 
efforts 
of 
their 
sovereigns 
to 
reconcile 
them 
were 
in 
vain. 
Catherine 
de 
Medicis, 
seeing 
the 
party 
of 
the 
Reformed 
Church 
increasing 
day 
by 
day 
in 
spite 
of 
persecution, 
and 
attracting 
a 
considerable 
number 
of 
nobles 
and 
magistrates, 
thought 
to 
disarm 
them 
by 
convoking 
at 
Poissy, 
in 
1561, 
an 
assembly 
of 
bishops 
and 
pastors 
with 
the 
object 
of 
fusing 
the 
two 
doctrines. 
Such 
an 
enterprise 
indicated 
that 
the 
queen, 
despite 
her 
subtlety, 
knew 
nothing 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
mystic 
logic. 
Not 
in 
all 
history 
can 
one 
cite 
an 
example 
of 
a 
belief 
destroyed 
or 
reduced 
by 
means 
of 
refutation. 
Catherine 
did 
not 
even 
know 
that 
although 
toleration 
is 
with 
difficulty 
possible 
between 
individuals, 
it 
is 
impossible 
between 
collectivities. 
Her 
attempt 
failed 
completely. 
The 
assembled 
theologians 
hurled 
texts 
and 
insults 
at 
one 
another's 
heads, 
but 
no 
one 
was 
moved. 
Catherine 
thought 
to 
succeed 
better 
in 
1562 
by 
promulgating 
an 
edict 
according 
Protestants 
the 
right 
to 
unite 
in 
the 
public 
celebration 
of 
their 
cult. 


This 
tolerance, 
very 
admirable 
from 
a 
philosophical 
point 
of 
view, 
but 
not 
at 
all 
wise 
from 
the 
political 
standpoint, 
had 
no 
other 
result 
beyond 
exasperating 
both 
parties. 
In 
the 
Midi, 
where 
the 
Protestants 
were 
strongest, 
they 
persecuted 
the 
Catholics, 
sought 
to 
convert 
them 
by 
violence, 
cut 
their 



throats 
if 
they 
did 
not 
succeed, 
and 
sacked 
their 
cathedrals. 
In 
the 
regions 
where 
the 
Catholics 
were 
more 
numerous 
the 
Reformers 
suffered 
like 
persecutions. 


Such 
hostilities 
as 
these 
inevitably 
engendered 
civil 
war. 
Thus 
arose 
the 
so-called 
religious 
wars, 
which 
so 
long 
spilled 
the 
blood 
of 
France. 
The 
cities 
were 
ravaged, 
the 
inhabitants 
massacred, 
and 
the 
struggle 
rapidly 
assumed 
that 
special 
quality 
of 
ferocity 
peculiar 
to 
religious 
or 
political 
conflicts, 
which, 
at 
a 
later 
date, 
was 
to 
reappear 
in 
the 
wars 
of 
La 
Vendee. 


Old 
men, 
women, 
and 
children, 
all 
were 
exterminated. 
A 
certain 
Baron 
d'Oppede, 
first 
president 
of 
the 
Parliament 
of 
Aix, 
had 
already 
set 
an 
example 
by 
killing 
3,000 
persons 
in 
the 
space 
of 
ten 
days, 
with 
refinements 
of 
cruelty, 
and 
destroying 
three 
cities 
and 
twenty-two 
villages. 
Montluc, 
a 
worthy 
forerunner 
of 
Carrier, 
had 
the 
Calvinists 
thrown 
living 
into 
the 
wells 
until 
these 
were 
full. 
The 
Protestants 
were 
no 
more 
humane. 
They 
did 
not 
spare 
even 
the 
Catholic 
churches, 
and 
treated 
the 
tombs 
and 
statues 
just 
as 
the 
delegates 
of 
the 
Convention 
were 
to 
treat 
the 
royal 
tombs 
of 
Saint 
Denis. 


Under 
the 
influence 
of 
these 
conflicts 
France 
was 
progressively 
disintegrated, 
and 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
reign 
of 
Henri 
III. 
was 
parcelled 
out 
into 
veritable 
little 
confederated 
municipal 
republics, 
forming 
so 
many 
sovereign 
states. 
The 
royal 
power 
was 
vanishing. 
The 
States 
of 
Blois 
claimed 
to 
dictate 
their 
wishes 
to 
Henri 
III., 
who 
had 
fled 
from 
his 
capital. 
In 
1577 
the 
traveller 
Lippomano, 
who 
traversed 
France, 
saw 
important 
cities— 
Orleans, 
Tours, 
Blois, 
Poitiers—entirely 
devastated, 
the 
cathedrals 
and 
churches 
in 
ruins, 
and 
the 
tombs 
shattered. 
This 
was 
almost 
the 
state 
of 
France 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Directory. 


Among 
the 
events 
of 
this 
epoch, 
that 
which 
has 
left 
the 
darkest 
memory, 
although 
it 
was 
not 
perhaps 
the 
most 
murderous, 
was 
the 
massacre 
of 
St. 
Bartholomew 
in 
1572, 
ordered, 
according 
to 
the 
historians, 
by 
Catherine 
de 
Medicis 
and 
Charles 
IX. 


One 
does 
not 
require 
a 
very 
profound 
knowledge 
of 
psychology 
to 
realise 
that 
no 
sovereign 
could 
have 
ordered 
such 
an 
event. 
St. 
Bartholomew's 
Day 
was 
not 
a 
royal 
but 
a 
popular 
crime. 
Catherine 
de 
Medicis, 
believing 
her 
existence 
and 
that 
of 
the 
king 
threatened 
by 
a 
plot 
directed 
by 
four 
or 
five 
Protestant 
leaders 
then 
in 
Paris, 
sent 
men 
to 
kill 
them 
in 
their 
houses, 
according 
to 
the 
summary 
fashion 
of 
the 
time. 
The 
massacre 
which 
followed 
is 
very 
well 
explained 
by 
M. 
Battifol 
in 
the 
following 
terms:— 


``At 
the 
report 
of 
what 
was 
afoot 
the 
rumour 
immediately 
ran 
through 



Paris 
that 
the 
Huguenots 
were 
being 
massacred; 
Catholic 
gentlemen, 
soldiers 
of 
the 
guard, 
archers, 
men 
of 
the 
people, 
in 
short 
all 
Paris, 
rushed 
into 
the 
streets, 
arms 
in 
hand, 
in 
order 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
execution, 
and 
the 
general 
massacre 
commenced, 
to 
the 
sound 
of 
ferocious 
cries 
of 
`The 
Huguenots! 
Kill, 
kill!' 
They 
were 
struck 
down, 
they 
were 
drowned, 
they 
were 
hanged. 
All 
that 
were 
known 
as 
heretics 
were 
so 
served. 
Two 
thousand 
persons 
were 
killed 
in 
Paris.'' 


By 
contagion, 
the 
people 
of 
the 
provinces 
imitated 
those 
of 
Paris, 
and 
six 
to 
eight 
thousand 
Protestants 
were 
slain. 


When 
time 
had 
somewhat 
cooled 
religious 
passions, 
all 
the 
historians, 
even 
the 
Catholics, 
spoke 
of 
St. 
Bartholomew's 
Day 
with 
indignation. 
They 
thus 
showed 
how 
difficult 
it 
is 
for 
the 
mentality 
of 
one 
epoch 
to 
understand 
that 
of 
another. 


Far 
from 
being 
criticised, 
St. 
Bartholomew's 
Day 
provoked 
an 
indescribable 
enthusiasm 
throughout 
the 
whole 
of 
Catholic 
Europe. 


Philip 
II. 
was 
delirious 
with 
joy 
when 
he 
heard 
the 
news, 
and 
the 
King 
of 
France 
received 
more 
congratulations 
than 
if 
he 
had 
won 
a 
great 
battle. 


But 
it 
was 
Pope 
Gregory 
XIII. 
above 
all 
who 
manifested 
the 
keenest 
satisfaction. 
He 
had 
a 
medal 
struck 
to 
commemorate 
the 
happy 
event,[2] 
ordered 
joy-fires 
to 
be 
lit 
and 
cannon 
fired, 
celebrated 
several 
masses, 
and 
sent 
for 
the 
painter 
Vasari 
to 
depict 
on 
the 
walls 
of 
the 
Vatican 
the 
principal 
scenes 
of 
carnage. 
Further, 
he 
sent 
to 
the 
King 
of 
France 
an 
ambassador 
instructed 
to 
felicitate 
that 
monarch 
upon 
his 
fine 
action. 
It 
is 
historical 
details 
of 
this 
kind 
that 
enable 
us 
to 
comprehend 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
believer. 
The 
Jacobins 
of 
the 
Terror 
had 
a 
mentality 
very 
like 
that 
of 
Gregory 
XIII. 


[2] 
The 
medal 
must 
have 
been 
distributed 
pretty 
widely, 
for 
the 
cabinet 
of 
medals 
at 
the 
Bibliotheque 
Nationale 
possesses 
three 
examples: 
one 
in 
gold, 
one 
in 
silver, 
and 
one 
in 
copper. 
This 
medal, 
reproduced 
by 
Bonnani 
in 
his 
Numism. 
Pontific. 
(vol. 
i. 
p. 
336), 
represents 
on 
one 
side 
Gregory 
XIII., 
and 
on 
the 
other 
an 
angel 
striking 
Huguenots 
with 
a 
sword. 
The 
exergue 
is 
Ugonotorum 
strages, 
that 
is, 
Massacre 
of 
the 
Huguenots. 
(The 
word 
strages 
may 
be 
translated 
by 
carnage 
or 
massacre, 
a 
sense 
which 
it 
possesses 
in 
Cicero 
and 
Livy; 
or 
again 
by 
disaster, 
ruin, 
a 
sense 
attributed 
to 
it 
in 
Virgil 
and 
Tacitus.) 

Naturally 
the 
Protestants 
were 
not 
indifferent 
to 
such 
a 
hecatomb, 
and 
they 
made 
such 
progress 
that 
in 
1576 
Henri 
III. 
was 
reduced 
to 
granting 
them, 
by 
the 
Edict 
of 
Beaulieu, 
entire 
liberty 
of 
worship, 
eight 
strong 
places, 
and, 
in 
the 
Parliaments, 
Chambers 
composed 
half 
of 
Catholics 
and 
half 
of 
Huguenots. 


These 
forced 
concessions 
did 
not 
lead 
to 
peace. 
A 
Catholic 
League 
was 
created, 
having 
the 
Duke 
of 
Guise 
at 
its 
head, 
and 
the 
conflict 
continued. 
But 
it 
could 
not 
last 
for 
ever. 
We 
know 
how 
Henri 
IV. 
put 
an 
end 
to 
it, 
at 
least 
for 
a 
time, 
by 
his 
abjuration 
in 
1593, 
and 
by 
the 
Edict 
of 
Nantes. 


The 
struggle 
was 
quieted 
but 
not 
terminated. 
Under 
Louis 
XIII. 
the 
Protestants 
were 
still 
restless, 
and 
in 
1627 
Richelieu 
was 
obliged 
to 
besiege 
La 
Rochelle, 
where 
15,000 
Protestants 
perished. 
Afterwards, 
possessing 
more 
political 
than 
religious 
feeling, 
the 
famous 
Cardinal 
proved 
extremely 
tolerant 
toward 
the 
Reformers. 


This 
tolerance 
could 
not 
last. 
Contrary 
beliefs 
cannot 
come 
into 
contact 
without 
seeking 
to 
annihilate 
each 
other, 
as 
soon 
as 
one 
feels 
capable 
of 
dominating 
the 
other. 
Under 
Louis 
XIV. 
the 
Protestants 
had 
become 
by 
far 
the 
weaker, 
and 
were 
forced 
to 
renounce 
the 
struggle 
and 
live 
at 
peace. 
Their 
number 
was 
then 
about 
1,200,000, 
and 
they 
possessed 
more 
than 
600 
churches, 
served 
by 
about 
700 
pastors. 
The 
presence 
of 
these 
heretics 
on 
French 
soil 
was 
intolerable 
to 
the 
Catholic 
clergy, 
who 
endeavoured 
to 
persecute 
them 
in 
various 
ways. 
As 
these 
persecutions 
had 
little 
result, 
Louis 


XIV. 
resorted 
to 
dragonnading 
them 
in 
1685, 
when 
many 
individuals 
perished, 
but 
without 
further 
result. 
Under 
the 
pressure 
of 
the 
clergy, 
notably 
of 
Bossuett, 
the 
Edict 
of 
Nantes 
was 
revoked, 
and 
the 
Protestants 
were 
forced 
to 
accept 
conversion 
or 
to 
leave 
France. 
This 
disastrous 
emigration 
lasted 
a 
long 
time, 
and 
is 
said 
to 
have 
cost 
France 
400,000 
inhabitants, 
men 
of 
notable 
energy, 
since 
they 
had 
the 
courage 
to 
listen 
to 
their 
conscience 
rather 
than 
their 
interests. 
6. 
The 
results 
of 
Religious 
Revolutions. 
If 
religious 
revolutions 
were 
judged 
only 
by 
the 
gloomy 
story 
of 
the 
Reformation, 
we 
should 
be 
forced 
to 
regard 
them 
as 
highly 
disastrous. 
But 
all 
have 
not 
played 
a 
like 
part, 
the 
civilising 
influence 
of 
certain 
among 
them 
being 
considerable. 



By 
giving 
a 
people 
moral 
unity 
they 
greatly 
increase 
its 
material 
power. 
We 
see 
this 
notably 
when 
a 
new 
faith, 
brought 
by 
Mohammed, 
transforms 
the 
petty 
and 
impotent 
tribes 
of 
Arabia 
into 
a 
formidable 
nation. 


Such 
a 
new 
religious 
belief 
does 
not 
merely 
render 
a 
people 
homogeneous. 
It 
attains 
a 
result 
that 
no 
philosophy, 
no 
code 
ever 
attained: 
it 
sensibly 
transforms 
what 
is 
almost 
unchangeable, 
the 
sentiments 
of 
a 
race. 


We 
see 
this 
at 
the 
period 
when 
the 
most 
powerful 
religious 
revolution 
recorded 
by 
history 
overthrew 
paganism 
to 
substitute 
a 
God 
who 
came 
from 
the 
plains 
of 
Galilee. 
The 
new 
ideal 
demanded 
the 
renunciation 
of 
all 
the 
joys 
of 
existence 
in 
order 
to 
acquire 
the 
eternal 
happiness 
of 
heaven. 
No 
doubt 
such 
an 
ideal 
was 
readily 
accepted 
by 
the 
poor, 
the 
enslaved, 
the 
disinherited 
who 
were 
deprived 
of 
all 
the 
joys 
of 
life 
here 
below, 
to 
whom 
an 
enchanting 
future 
was 
offered 
in 
exchange 
for 
a 
life 
without 
hope. 
But 
the 
austere 
existence 
so 
easily 
embraced 
by 
the 
poor 
was 
also 
embraced 
by 
the 
rich. 
In 
this 
above 
all 
was 
the 
power 
of 
the 
new 
faith 
manifested. 


Not 
only 
did 
the 
Christian 
revolution 
transform 
manners: 
it 
also 
exercised, 
for 
a 
space 
of 
two 
thousand 
years, 
a 
preponderating 
influence 
over 
civilisation. 
Directly 
a 
religious 
faith 
triumphs 
all 
the 
elements 
of 
civilisation 
naturally 
adapt 
themselves 
to 
it, 
so 
that 
civilisation 
is 
rapidly 
transformed. 
Writers, 
artists 
and 
philosophers 
merely 
symbolise, 
in 
their 
works, 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 
new 
faith. 


When 
any 
religious 
or 
political 
faith 
whatsoever 
has 
triumphed, 
not 
only 
is 
reason 
powerless 
to 
affect 
it, 
but 
it 
even 
finds 
motives 
which 
impel 
it 
to 
interpret 
and 
so 
justify 
the 
faith 
in 
question, 
and 
to 
strive 
to 
impose 
it 
upon 
others. 
There 
were 
probably 
as 
many 
theologians 
and 
orators 
in 
the 
time 
of 
Moloch, 
to 
prove 
the 
utility 
of 
human 
sacrifices, 
as 
there 
were 
at 
other 
periods 
to 
glorify 
the 
Inquisition, 
the 
massacre 
of 
St. 
Bartholomew, 
and 
the 
hecatombs 
of 
the 
Terror. 


We 
must 
not 
hope 
to 
see 
peoples 
possessed 
by 
strong 
beliefs 
readily 
achieve 
tolerance. 
The 
only 
people 
who 
attained 
to 
toleration 
in 
the 
ancient 
world 
were 
the 
polytheists. 
The 
nations 
which 
practise 
toleration 
at 
the 
present 
time 
are 
those 
that 
might 
well 
be 
termed 
polytheistical, 
since, 
as 
in 
England 
and 
America, 
they 
are 
divided 
into 
innumerable 
sects. 
Under 
identical 
names 
they 
really 
adore 
very 
different 
deities. 


The 
multiplicity 
of 
beliefs 
which 
results 
in 
such 
toleration 
finally 
results 
also 
in 
weakness. 
We 
therefore 
come 
to 
a 
psychological 
problem 
not 
hitherto 
resolved: 
how 
to 
possess 
a 
faith 
at 
once 
powerful 
and 
tolerant. 



The 
foregoing 
brief 
explanation 
reveals 
the 
large 
part 
played 
by 
religious 
revolutions 
and 
the 
power 
of 
beliefs. 
Despite 
their 
slight 
rational 
value 
they 
shape 
history, 
and 
prevent 
the 
peoples 
from 
remaining 
a 
mass 
of 
individuals 
without 
cohesion 
or 
strength. 
Man 
has 
needed 
them 
at 
all 
times 
to 
orientate 
his 
thought 
and 
guide 
his 
conduct. 
No 
philosophy 
has 
as 
yet 
succeeded 
in 
replacing 
them. 


CHAPTER 
III 


THE 
ACTION 
OF 
GOVERNMENTS 
IN 
REVOLUTIONS 


1. 
The 
feeble 
resistance 
of 
Governments 
in 
time 
of 
Revolution. 
Many 
modern 
nations—France, 
Spain, 
Italy, 
Austria, 
Poland, 
Japan, 
Turkey, 
Portugal, 
&c.—have 
known 
revolutions 
within 
the 
last 
century. 
These 
were 
usually 
characterised 
by 
their 
instantaneous 
quality 
and 
the 
facility 
with 
which 
the 
governments 
attacked 
were 
overthrown. 


The 
instantaneous 
nature 
of 
these 
revolutions 
is 
explained 
by 
the 
rapidity 
of 
mental 
contagion 
due 
to 
modern 
methods 
of 
publicity. 
The 
slight 
resistance 
of 
the 
governments 
attacked 
is 
more 
surprising. 
It 
implies 
a 
total 
inability 
to 
comprehend 
and 
foresee 
created 
by 
a 
blind 
confidence 
in 
their 
own 
strength. 


The 
facility 
with 
which 
governments 
fall 
is 
not 
however 
a 
new 
phenomenon. 
It 
has 
been 
proved 
more 
than 
once, 
not 
only 
in 
autocratic 
systems, 
which 
are 
always 
overturned 
by 
palace 
conspiracies, 
but 
also 
in 
governments 
perfectly 
instructed 
in 
the 
state 
of 
public 
opinion 
by 
the 
press 
and 
their 
own 
agents. 


Among 
these 
instantaneous 
downfalls 
one 
of 
the 
most 
striking 
was 
that 
which 
followed 
the 
Ordinances 
of 
Charles 
X. 
This 
monarch 
was, 
as 
we 
know, 
overthrown 
in 
four 
days. 
His 
minister 
Polignac 
had 
taken 
no 
measures 
of 
defence, 
and 
the 
king 
was 
so 
confident 
of 
the 
tranquillity 
of 
Paris 
that 
he 
had 
gone 
hunting. 
The 
army 
was 
not 
in 
the 
least 
hostile, 
as 
in 
the 
reign 
of 
Louis 
XVI., 
but 
the 
troops, 
badly 
officered, 
disbanded 
before 
the 
attacks 
of 
a 
few 
insurgents. 


The 
overthrow 
of 
Louis-Philippe 
was 
still 
more 
typical, 
since 
it 
did 
not 
result 
from 
any 
arbitrary 
action 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
sovereign. 
This 
monarch 



was 
not 
surrounded 
by 
the 
hatred 
which 
finally 
surrounded 
Charles 
X., 
and 
his 
fall 
was 
the 
result 
of 
an 
insignificant 
riot 
which 
could 
easily 
have 
been 
repressed. 


Historians, 
who 
can 
hardly 
comprehend 
how 
a 
solidly 
constituted 
government, 
supported 
by 
an 
imposing 
army, 
can 
be 
overthrown 
by 
a 
few 
rioters, 
naturally 
attributed 
the 
fall 
of 
Louis-Philippe 
to 
deep-seated 
causes. 
In 
reality 
the 
incapacity 
of 
the 
generals 
entrusted 
with 
his 
defence 
was 
the 
real 
cause 
of 
his 
fall. 


This 
case 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
instructive 
that 
could 
be 
cited, 
and 
is 
worthy 
of 
a 
moment's 
consideration. 
It 
has 
been 
perfectly 
investigated 
by 
General 
Bonnal, 
in 
the 
light 
of 
the 
notes 
of 
an 
eye-witness, 
General 
Elchingen. 
Thirty-
six 
thousand 
troops 
were 
then 
in 
Paris, 
but 
the 
weakness 
and 
incapacity 
of 
their 
officers 
made 
it 
impossible 
to 
use 
them. 
Contradictory 
orders 
were 
given, 
and 
finally 
the 
troops 
were 
forbidden 
to 
fire 
on 
the 
people, 
who, 
moreover—and 
nothing 
could 
have 
been 
more 
dangerous—were 
permitted 
to 
mingle 
with 
the 
troops. 
The 
riot 
succeeded 
without 
fighting 
and 
forced 
the 
king 
to 
abdicate. 


Applying 
to 
the 
preceding 
case 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
psychology 
of 
crowds, 
General 
Bonnal 
shows 
how 
easily 
the 
riot 
which 
overthrew 
Louis-
Philippe 
could 
have 
been 
controlled. 
He 
proves, 
notably, 
that 
if 
the 
commanding 
officers 
had 
not 
completely 
lost 
their 
heads 
quite 
a 
small 
body 
of 
troops 
could 
have 
prevented 
the 
insurgents 
from 
invading 
the 
Chamber 
of 
Deputies. 
This 
last, 
composed 
of 
monarchists, 
would 
certainly 
have 
proclaimed 
the 
Count 
of 
Paris 
under 
the 
regency 
of 
his 
mother. 


Similar 
phenomena 
were 
observable 
in 
the 
revolutions 
of 
Spain 
and 
Portugal. 


These 
facts 
show 
the 
role 
of 
petty 
accessory 
circumstances 
in 
great 
events, 
and 
prove 
that 
one 
must 
not 
speak 
too 
readily 
of 
the 
general 
laws 
of 
history. 
Without 
the 
riot 
which 
overthrew 
Louis-Philippe, 
we 
should 
probably 
have 
seen 
neither 
the 
Republic 
of 
1848, 
nor 
the 
Second 
Empire, 
nor 
Sedan, 
nor 
the 
invasion, 
nor 
the 
loss 
of 
Alsace. 


In 
the 
revolutions 
of 
which 
I 
have 
just 
been 
speaking 
the 
army 
was 
of 
no 
assistance 
to 
the 
government, 
but 
did 
not 
turn 
against 
it. 
It 
sometimes 
happens 
otherwise. 
It 
is 
often 
the 
army 
which 
effects 
the 
revolution, 
as 
in 
Turkey 
and 
Portugal. 
The 
innumerable 
revolutions 
of 
the 
Latin 
republics 
of 
America 
are 
effected 
by 
the 
army. 


When 
a 
revolution 
is 
effected 
by 
an 
army 
the 
new 
rulers 
naturally 
fall 



under 
its 
domination. 
I 
have 
already 
recalled 
the 
fact 
that 
this 
was 
the 
case 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Roman 
Empire, 
when 
the 
emperors 
were 
made 
and 
unmade 
by 
the 
soldiery. 


The 
same 
thing 
has 
sometimes 
been 
witnessed 
in 
modern 
times. 
The 
following 
extract 
from 
a 
newspaper, 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
Greek 
revolution, 
shows 
what 
becomes 
of 
a 
government 
dominated 
by 
its 
army:— 


``One 
day 
it 
was 
announced 
that 
eighty 
officers 
of 
the 
navy 
would 
send 
in 
their 
resignations 
if 
the 
government 
did 
not 
dismiss 
the 
leaders 
of 
whom 
they 
complained. 
Another 
time 
it 
was 
the 
agricultural 
labourers 
on 
a 
farm 
(metairie) 
belonging 
to 
the 
Crown 
Prince 
who 
demanded 
the 
partition 
of 
the 
soil 
among 
them. 
The 
navy 
protested 
against 
the 
promotion 
promised 
to 
Colonel 
Zorbas. 
Colonel 
Zorbas, 
after 
a 
week 
of 
discussion 
with 
Lieutenant 
Typaldos, 
treated 
with 
the 
President 
of 
the 
Council 
as 
one 
power 
with 
another. 
During 
this 
time 
the 
Federation 
of 
the 
corporations 
abused 
the 
officers 
of 
the 
navy. 
A 
deputy 
demanded 
that 
these 
officers 
and 
their 
families 
should 
be 
treated 
as 
brigands. 
When 
Commander 
Miaoulis 
fired 
on 
the 
rebels, 
the 
sailors, 
who 
first 
of 
all 
had 
obeyed 
Typaldos, 
returned 
to 
duty. 
This 
is 
no 
longer 
the 
harmonious 
Greece 
of 
Pericles 
and 
Themistocles. 
It 
is 
a 
hideous 
camp 
of 
Agramant.'' 


A 
revolution 
cannot 
be 
effected 
without 
the 
assistance 
or 
at 
least 
the 
neutrality 
of 
the 
army, 
but 
it 
often 
happens 
that 
the 
movement 
commences 
without 
it. 
This 
was 
the 
case 
with 
the 
revolutions 
of 
1830 
and 
1848, 
and 
that 
of 
1870, 
which 
overthrew 
the 
Empire 
after 
the 
humiliation 
of 
France 
by 
the 
surrender 
of 
Sedan. 


The 
majority 
of 
revolutions 
take 
place 
in 
the 
capitals, 
and 
by 
means 
of 
contagion 
spread 
through 
the 
country; 
but 
this 
is 
not 
a 
constant 
rule. 
We 
know 
that 
during 
the 
French 
Revolution 
La 
Vendee, 
Brittany, 
and 
the 
Midi 
revolted 
spontaneously 
against 
Paris. 


2. 
How 
the 
resistance 
of 
Governments 
may 
overcome 
Revolution. 
In 
the 
greater 
number 
of 
the 
revolutions 
enumerated 
above, 
we 
have 
seen 
governments 
perish 
by 
their 
weakness. 
As 
soon 
as 
they 
were 
touched 
they 
fell. 


The 
Russian 
Revolution 
proved 
that 
a 
government 
which 
defends 
itself 
energetically 
may 
finally 
triumph. 



Never 
was 
revolution 
more 
menacing 
to 
the 
government. 
After 
the 
disasters 
suffered 
in 
the 
Orient, 
and 
the 
severities 
of 
a 
too 
oppressive 
autocratic 
regime, 
all 
classes 
of 
society, 
including 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
army 
and 
the 
fleet, 
had 
revolted. 
The 
railways, 
posts, 
and 
telegraph 
services 
had 
struck, 
so 
that 
communications 
between 
the 
various 
portions 
of 
the 
vast 
empire 
were 
interrupted. 


The 
rural 
class 
itself, 
forming 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
nation, 
began 
to 
feel 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
propaganda. 
The 
lot 
of 
the 
peasants 
was 
wretched. 
They 
were 
obliged, 
by 
the 
system 
of 
the 
mir, 
to 
cultivate 
soil 
which 
they 
could 
not 
acquire. 
The 
government 
resolved 
immediately 
to 
conciliate 
this 
large 
class 
of 
peasants 
by 
turning 
them 
into 
proprietors. 
Special 
laws 
forced 
the 
landlords 
to 
sell 
the 
peasants 
a 
portion 
of 
their 
lands, 
and 
banks 
intended 
to 
lend 
the 
buyers 
the 
necessary 
purchase-money 
were 
created. 
The 
sums 
lent 
were 
to 
be 
repaid 
by 
small 
annuities 
deducted 
from 
the 
product 
of 
the 
sale 
of 
the 
crops. 


Assured 
of 
the 
neutrality 
of 
the 
peasants, 
the 
government 
could 
contend 
with 
the 
fanatics 
who 
were 
burning 
the 
towns, 
throwing 
bombs 
among 
the 
crowds, 
and 
waging 
a 
merciless 
warfare. 
All 
those 
who 
could 
be 
taken 
were 
killed. 
Such 
extermination 
is 
the 
only 
method 
discovered 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
world 
by 
which 
a 
society 
can 
be 
protected 
against 
the 
rebels 
who 
wish 
to 
destroy 
it. 


The 
victorious 
government 
understood 
moreover 
the 
necessity 
of 
satisfying 
the 
legitimate 
claims 
of 
the 
enlightened 
portion 
of 
the 
nation. 
It 
created 
a 
parliament 
instructed 
to 
prepare 
laws 
and 
control 
expenditure. 


The 
history 
of 
the 
Russian 
Revolution 
shows 
us 
how 
a 
government, 
all 
of 
whose 
natural 
supports 
have 
crumbled 
in 
succession, 
can, 
with 
wisdom 
and 
firmness, 
triumph 
over 
the 
most 
formidable 
obstacles. 
It 
has 
been 
very 
justly 
said 
that 
governments 
are 
not 
overthrown, 
but 
that 
they 
commit 
suicide. 


3. 
Revolutions 
effected 
by 
Governments.—Examples: 
China, 
Turkey, 
&c. 
Governments 
almost 
invariably 
fight 
revolutions; 
they 
hardly 
ever 
create 
them. 
Representing 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
moment 
and 
general 
opinion, 
they 
follow 
the 
reformers 
timidly; 
they 
do 
not 
precede 
them. 
Sometimes, 
however, 
certain 
governments 
have 
attempted 
those 
sudden 
reforms 
which 
we 
know 
as 
revolutions. 
The 
stability 
or 
instability 
of 
the 
national 
mind 
decrees 
the 



success 
or 
failure 
of 
such 
attempts. 


They 
succeed 
when 
the 
people 
on 
whom 
the 
government 
seeks 
to 
impose 
new 
institutions 
is 
composed 
of 
semi-barbarous 
tribes, 
without 
fixed 
laws, 
without 
solid 
traditions; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
without 
a 
settled 
national 
mind. 
Such 
was 
the 
condition 
of 
Russia 
in 
the 
days 
of 
Peter 
the 
Great. 
We 
know 
how 
he 
sought 
to 
Europeanise 
the 
semi-Asiatic 
populations 
by 
means 
of 
force. 


Japan 
is 
another 
example 
of 
a 
revolution 
effected 
by 
a 
government, 
but 
it 
was 
her 
machinery, 
not 
her 
mind 
that 
was 
reformed. 


It 
needs 
a 
very 
powerful 
autocrat, 
seconded 
by 
a 
man 
of 
genius, 
to 
succeed, 
even 
partially, 
in 
such 
a 
task. 
More 
often 
than 
not 
the 
reformer 
finds 
that 
the 
whole 
people 
rises 
up 
against 
him. 
Then, 
to 
the 
contrary 
of 
what 
befalls 
in 
an 
ordinary 
revolution, 
the 
autocrat 
is 
revolutionary 
and 
the 
people 
is 
conservative. 
But 
an 
attentive 
study 
will 
soon 
show 
you 
that 
the 
peoples 
are 
always 
extremely 
conservative. 


Failure 
is 
the 
rule 
with 
these 
attempts. 
Whether 
effected 
by 
the 
upper 
classes 
or 
the 
lower, 
revolutions 
do 
not 
change 
the 
souls 
of 
peoples 
that 
have 
been 
a 
long 
time 
established. 
They 
only 
change 
those 
things 
that 
are 
worn 
by 
time 
and 
ready 
to 
fall. 


China 
is 
at 
the 
present 
time 
making 
a 
very 
interesting 
but 
impossible 
experiment, 
in 
seeking, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
government, 
suddenly 
to 
renew 
the 
institutions 
of 
the 
country. 
The 
revolution 
which 
overturned 
the 
dynasty 
of 
her 
ancient 
sovereigns 
was 
the 
indirect 
consequence 
of 
the 
discontent 
provoked 
by 
reforms 
which 
the 
government 
had 
sought 
to 
impose 
with 
a 
view 
to 
ameliorating 
the 
condition 
of 
China. 
The 
suppression 
of 
opium 
and 
gaming, 
the 
reform 
of 
the 
army, 
and 
the 
creation 
of 
schools, 
involved 
an 
increase 
of 
taxation 
which, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
reforms 
themselves, 
greatly 
indisposed 
the 
general 
opinion. 


A 
few 
cultured 
Chinese 
educated 
in 
the 
schools 
of 
Europe 
profited 
by 
this 
discontent 
to 
raise 
the 
people 
and 
proclaim 
a 
republic, 
an 
institution 
of 
which 
the 
Chinese 
could 
have 
had 
no 
conception. 


It 
surely 
cannot 
long 
survive, 
for 
the 
impulse 
which 
has 
given 
birth 
to 
it 
is 
not 
a 
movement 
of 
progress, 
but 
of 
reaction. 
The 
word 
republic, 
to 
the 
Chinaman 
intellectualised 
by 
his 
European 
education, 
is 
simply 
synonymous 
with 
the 
rejection 
of 
the 
yoke 
of 
laws, 
rules, 
and 
long-established 
restraints. 
Cutting 
off 
his 
pigtail, 
covering 
his 
head 
with 
a 
cap, 
and 
calling 
himself 
a 
Republican, 
the 
young 
Chinaman 
thinks 
to 
give 
the 
rein 
to 
all 
his 
instincts. 
This 
is 
more 
or 
less 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
republic 
that 
a 
large 
part 
of 
the 
French 



people 
entertained 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
great 
Revolution. 


China 
will 
soon 
discover 
the 
fate 
that 
awaits 
a 
society 
deprived 
of 
the 
armour 
slowly 
wrought 
by 
the 
past. 
After 
a 
few 
years 
of 
bloody 
anarchy 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
establish 
a 
power 
whose 
tyranny 
will 
inevitably 
be 
far 
severer 
than 
that 
which 
was 
overthrown. 
Science 
has 
not 
yet 
discovered 
the 
magic 
ring 
capable 
of 
saving 
a 
society 
without 
discipline. 
There 
is 
no 
need 
to 
impose 
discipline 
when 
it 
has 
become 
hereditary, 
but 
when 
the 
primitive 
instincts 
have 
been 
allowed 
to 
destroy 
the 
barriers 
painfully 
erected 
by 
slow 
ancestral 
labours, 
they 
cannot 
be 
reconstituted 
save 
by 
an 
energetic 
tyranny. 


As 
a 
proof 
of 
these 
assertions 
we 
may 
instance 
an 
experiment 
analogous 
to 
that 
undertaken 
by 
China; 
that 
recently 
attempted 
by 
Turkey. 
A 
few 
years 
ago 
young 
men 
instructed 
in 
European 
schools 
and 
full 
of 
good 
intentions 
succeeded, 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
a 
number 
of 
officers, 
in 
overthrowing 
a 
Sultan 
whose 
tyranny 
seemed 
insupportable. 
Having 
acquired 
our 
robust 
Latin 
faith 
in 
the 
magic 
power 
of 
formulae, 
they 
thought 
they 
could 
establish 
the 
representative 
system 
in 
a 
country 
half-civilised, 
profoundly 
divided 
by 
religious 
hatred, 
and 
peopled 
by 
divers 
races. 


The 
attempt 
has 
not 
prospered 
hitherto. 
The 
authors 
of 
the 
reformation 
had 
to 
learn 
that 
despite 
their 
liberalism 
they 
were 
forced 
to 
govern 
by 
methods 
very 
like 
those 
employed 
by 
the 
government 
overthrown. 
They 
could 
neither 
prevent 
summary 
executions 
nor 
wholesale 
massacres 
of 
Christians, 
nor 
could 
they 
remedy 
a 
single 
abuse. 


It 
would 
be 
unjust 
to 
reproach 
them. 
What 
in 
truth 
could 
they 
have 
done 
to 
change 
a 
people 
whose 
traditions 
have 
been 
fixed 
so 
long, 
whose 
religious 
passions 
are 
so 
intense, 
and 
whose 
Mohammedans, 
although 
in 
the 
minority, 
legitimately 
claim 
to 
govern 
the 
sacred 
city 
of 
their 
faith 
according 
to 
their 
code? 
How 
prevent 
Islam 
from 
remaining 
the 
State 
religion 
in 
a 
country 
where 
civil 
law 
and 
religious 
law 
are 
not 
yet 
plainly 
separated, 
and 
where 
faith 
in 
the 
Koran 
is 
the 
only 
tie 
by 
which 
the 
idea 
of 
nationality 
can 
be 
maintained? 


It 
was 
difficult 
to 
destroy 
such 
a 
state 
of 
affairs, 
so 
that 
we 
were 
bound 
to 
see 
the 
re-establishment 
of 
an 
autocratic 
organisation 
with 
an 
appearance 
of 
constitutionalism—that 
is 
to 
say, 
practically 
the 
old 
system 
once 
again. 
Such 
attempts 
afford 
a 
good 
example 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
people 
cannot 
choose 
its 
institutions 
until 
it 
has 
transformed 
its 
mind. 



4. 
Social 
elements 
which 
survive 
the 
changes 
of 
Government 
after 
Revolution. 
What 
we 
shall 
say 
later 
on 
as 
to 
the 
stable 
foundation 
of 
the 
national 
soul 
will 
enable 
us 
to 
appreciate 
the 
force 
of 
systems 
of 
government 
that 
have 
been 
long 
established, 
such 
as 
ancient 
monarchies. 
A 
monarch 
may 
easily 
be 
overthrown 
by 
conspirators, 
but 
these 
latter 
are 
powerless 
against 
the 
principles 
which 
the 
monarch 
represents. 
Napoleon 
at 
his 
fall 
was 
replaced 
not 
by 
his 
natural 
heir, 
but 
by 
the 
heir 
of 
kings. 
The 
latter 
incarnated 
an 
ancient 
principle, 
while 
the 
son 
of 
the 
Emperor 
personified 
ideas 
that 
were 
as 
yet 
imperfectly 
established 
in 
men's 
minds. 


For 
the 
same 
reason 
a 
minister, 
however 
able, 
however 
great 
the 
services 
he 
has 
rendered 
to 
his 
country, 
can 
very 
rarely 
overthrow 
his 
Sovereign. 
Bismarck 
himself 
could 
not 
have 
done 
so. 
This 
great 
minister 
had 
singlehanded 
created 
the 
unity 
of 
Germany, 
yet 
his 
master 
had 
only 
to 
touch 
him 
with 
his 
finger 
and 
he 
vanished. 
A 
man 
is 
as 
nothing 
before 
a 
principle 
supported 
by 
opinion. 


But 
even 
when, 
for 
various 
reasons, 
the 
principle 
incarnated 
by 
a 
government 
is 
annihilated 
with 
that 
government, 
as 
happened 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution, 
all 
the 
elements 
of 
social 
organisation 
do 
not 
perish 
at 
the 
same 
time. 


If 
we 
knew 
nothing 
of 
France 
but 
the 
disturbances 
of 
the 
last 
hundred 
years 
and 
more 
we 
might 
suppose 
the 
country 
to 
live 
in 
a 
state 
of 
profound 
anarchy. 
Now 
her 
economic, 
industrial, 
and 
even 
her 
political 
life 
manifests, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
a 
continuity 
that 
seems 
to 
be 
independent 
of 
all 
revolutions 
and 
governments. 


The 
fact 
is 
that 
beside 
the 
great 
events 
of 
which 
history 
treats 
are 
the 
little 
facts 
of 
daily 
life 
which 
the 
books 
neglect 
to 
tell. 
They 
are 
ruled 
by 
imperious 
necessities 
which 
halt 
for 
no 
man. 
Their 
total 
mass 
forms 
the 
real 
framework 
of 
the 
life 
of 
the 
people. 


While 
the 
study 
of 
great 
events 
shows 
us 
that 
the 
nominal 
government 
of 
France 
has 
been 
frequently 
changed 
in 
the 
space 
of 
a 
century, 
an 
examination 
of 
the 
little 
daily 
events 
will 
prove, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
that 
her 
real 
government 
has 
been 
little 
altered. 


Who 
in 
truth 
are 
the 
real 
rulers 
of 
a 
people? 
Kings 
and 
ministers, 
no 
doubt, 
in 
the 
great 
crises 
of 
national 
life, 
but 
they 
play 
no 
part 
whatever 
in 
the 



little 
realities 
which 
make 
up 
the 
life 
of 
every 
day. 
The 
real 
directing 
forces 
of 
a 
country 
are 
the 
administrations, 
composed 
of 
impersonal 
elements 
which 
are 
never 
affected 
by 
the 
changes 
of 
government. 
Conservative 
of 
traditions, 
they 
are 
anonymous 
and 
lasting, 
and 
constitute 
an 
occult 
power 
before 
which 
all 
others 
must 
eventually 
bow. 
Their 
action 
has 
even 
increased 
to 
such 
a 
degree 
that, 
as 
we 
shall 
presently 
show, 
there 
is 
a 
danger 
that 
they 
may 
form 
an 
anonymous 
State 
more 
powerful 
than 
the 
official 
State. 
France 
has 
thus 
come 
to 
be 
governed 
by 
heads 
of 
departments 
and 
government 
clerks. 
The 
more 
we 
study 
the 
history 
of 
revolutions 
the 
more 
we 
discover 
that 
they 
change 
practically 
nothing 
but 
the 
label. 
To 
create 
a 
revolution 
is 
easy, 
but 
to 
change 
the 
soul 
of 
a 
people 
is 
difficult 
indeed. 


CHAPTER 
IV 


THE 
PART 
PLAYED 
BY 
THE 
PEOPLE 
IN 
REVOLUTIONS 


1. 
The 
stability 
and 
malleability 
of 
the 
national 
mind. 
The 
knowledge 
of 
a 
people 
at 
any 
given 
moment 
of 
its 
history 
involves 
an 
understanding 
of 
its 
environment 
and 
above 
all 
of 
its 
past. 
Theoretically 
one 
may 
deny 
that 
past, 
as 
did 
the 
men 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
as 
many 
men 
of 
the 
present 
day 
have 
done, 
but 
its 
influence 
remains 
indestructible. 


In 
the 
past, 
built 
up 
by 
slow 
accumulations 
of 
centuries, 
was 
formed 
the 
aggregation 
of 
thoughts, 
sentiments, 
traditions, 
and 
prejudices 
constituting 
the 
national 
mind 
which 
makes 
the 
strength 
of 
a 
race. 
Without 
it 
no 
progress 
is 
possible. 
Each 
generation 
would 
necessitate 
a 
fresh 
beginning. 


The 
aggregate 
composing 
the 
soul 
of 
a 
people 
is 
solidly 
established 
only 
if 
it 
possesses 
a 
certain 
rigidity, 
but 
this 
rigidity 
must 
not 
pass 
a 
certain 
limit, 
or 
there 
would 
be 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
malleability. 


Without 
rigidity 
the 
ancestral 
soul 
would 
have 
no 
fixity, 
and 
without 
malleability 
it 
could 
not 
adapt 
itself 
to 
the 
changes 
of 
environment 
resulting 
from 
the 
progress 
of 
civilization. 


Excessive 
malleability 
of 
the 
national 
mind 
impels 
a 
people 
to 
incessant 
revolutions. 
Excess 
of 
rigidity 
leads 
it 
to 
decadence. 
Living 
species, 
like 
the 
races 
of 
humanity, 
disappear 
when, 
too 
fixedly 
established 
by 
a 
long 
past, 
they 
become 
incapable 
of 
adapting 
themselves 
to 
new 
conditions 
of 



existence. 


Few 
peoples 
have 
succeeded 
in 
effecting 
a 
just 
equilibrium 
between 
these 
two 
contrary 
qualities 
of 
stability 
and 
malleability. 
The 
Romans 
in 
antiquity 
and 
the 
English 
in 
modern 
times 
may 
be 
cited 
among 
those 
who 
have 
best 
attained 
it. 


The 
peoples 
whose 
mind 
is 
most 
fixed 
and 
established 
often 
effect 
the 
most 
violent 
revolutions. 
Not 
having 
succeeded 
in 
evolving 
progressively, 
in 
adapting 
themselves 
to 
changes 
of 
environment, 
they 
are 
forced 
to 
adapt 
themselves 
violently 
when 
such 
adaptation 
becomes 
indispensable. 


Stability 
is 
only 
acquired 
very 
slowly. 
The 
history 
of 
a 
race 
is 
above 
all 
the 
story 
of 
its 
long 
efforts 
to 
establish 
its 
mind. 
So 
long 
as 
it 
has 
not 
succeeded 
it 
forms 
a 
horde 
of 
barbarians 
without 
cohesion 
and 
strength. 
After 
the 
invasions 
of 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Roman 
Empire 
France 
took 
several 
centuries 
to 
form 
a 
national 
soul. 


She 
finally 
achieved 
one; 
but 
in 
the 
course 
of 
centuries 
this 
soul 
finally 
became 
too 
rigid. 
With 
a 
little 
more 
malleability, 
the 
ancient 
monarchy 
would 
have 
been 
slowly 
transformed 
as 
it 
was 
elsewhere, 
and 
we 
should 
have 
avoided, 
together 
with 
the 
Revolution 
and 
its 
consequences, 
the 
heavy 
task 
of 
remaking 
a 
national 
soul. 


The 
preceding 
considerations 
show 
us 
the 
part 
of 
race 
in 
the 
genesis 
of 
revolutions, 
and 
explain 
why 
the 
same 
revolutions 
will 
produce 
such 
different 
effects 
in 
different 
countries; 
why, 
for 
example, 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution, 
welcomed 
with 
such 
enthusiasm 
by 
some 
peoples, 
were 
rejected 
by 
others. 


Certainly 
England, 
although 
a 
very 
stable 
country, 
has 
suffered 
two 
revolutions 
and 
slain 
a 
king; 
but 
the 
mould 
of 
her 
mental 
armour 
was 
at 
once 
stable 
enough 
to 
retain 
the 
acquisitions 
of 
the 
past 
and 
malleable 
enough 
to 
modify 
them 
only 
within 
the 
necessary 
limits. 
Never 
did 
England 
dream, 
as 
did 
the 
men 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution, 
of 
destroying 
the 
ancestral 
heritage 
in 
order 
to 
erect 
a 
new 
society 
in 
the 
name 
of 
reason. 


``While 
the 
Frenchman,'' 
writes 
M. 
A. 
Sorel, 
``despised 
his 
government, 
detested 
his 
clergy, 
hated 
the 
nobility, 
and 
revolted 
against 
the 
laws, 
the 
Englishman 
was 
proud 
of 
his 
religion, 
his 
constitution, 
his 
aristocracy, 
his 
House 
of 
Lords. 
These 
were 
like 
so 
many 
towers 
of 
the 
formidable 
Bastille 
in 
which 
he 
entrenched 
himself, 
under 
the 
British 
standard, 
to 
judge 
Europe 
and 
cover 
her 
with 
contempt. 
He 
admitted 
that 
the 
command 
was 
disputed 
inside 
the 
fort, 
but 
no 
stranger 
must 
approach.'' 



The 
influence 
of 
race 
in 
the 
destiny 
of 
the 
peoples 
appears 
plainly 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
perpetual 
revolutions 
of 
the 
Spanish 
republics 
of 
South 
America. 
Composed 
of 
half-castes, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
of 
individuals 
whose 
diverse 
heredities 
have 
dissociated 
their 
ancestral 
characteristics, 
these 
populations 
have 
no 
national 
soul 
and 
therefore 
no 
stability. 
A 
people 
of 
half-
castes 
is 
always 
ungovernable. 


If 
we 
would 
learn 
more 
of 
the 
differences 
of 
political 
capacity 
which 
the 
racial 
factor 
creates 
we 
must 
examine 
the 
same 
nation 
as 
governed 
by 
two 
races 
successively. 


The 
event 
is 
not 
rare 
in 
history. 
It 
has 
been 
manifested 
in 
a 
striking 
manner 
of 
late 
in 
Cuba 
and 
the 
Philippines, 
which 
passed 
suddenly 
from 
the 
rule 
of 
Spain 
to 
that 
of 
the 
United 
States. 


We 
know 
in 
what 
anarchy 
and 
poverty 
Cuba 
existed 
under 
Spanish 
rule; 
we 
know, 
too, 
to 
what 
a 
degree 
of 
prosperity 
the 
island 
was 
brought 
in 
a 
few 
years 
when 
it 
fell 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
United 
States. 


The 
same 
experience 
was 
repeated 
in 
the 
Philippines, 
which 
for 
centuries 
had 
been 
governed 
by 
Spain. 
Finally 
the 
country 
was 
no 
more 
than 
a 
vast 
jungle, 
the 
home 
of 
epidemics 
of 
every 
kind, 
where 
a 
miserable 
population 
vegetated 
without 
commerce 
or 
industry. 
After 
a 
few 
years 
of 
American 
rule 
the 
country 
was 
entirely 
transformed: 
malaria, 
yellow 
fever, 
plague 
and 
cholera 
had 
entirely 
disappeared. 
The 
swamps 
were 
drained; 
the 
country 
was 
covered 
with 
railways, 
factories 
and 
schools. 
In 
thirteen 
years 
the 
mortality 
was 
reduced 
by 
two-thirds. 


It 
is 
to 
such 
examples 
that 
we 
must 
refer 
the 
theorist 
who 
has 
not 
yet 
grasped 
the 
profound 
significance 
of 
the 
word 
race, 
and 
how 
far 
the 
ancestral 
soul 
of 
a 
people 
rules 
over 
its 
destiny. 


2. 
How 
the 
people 
regards 
Revolution. 
The 
part 
of 
the 
people 
has 
been 
the 
same 
in 
all 
revolutions. 
It 
is 
never 
the 
people 
that 
conceives 
them 
nor 
directs 
them. 
Its 
activity 
is 
released 
by 
means 
of 
leaders. 


Only 
when 
the 
direct 
interests 
of 
the 
people 
are 
involved 
do 
we 
see, 
as 
recently 
in 
Champagne, 
any 
fraction 
of 
the 
people 
rising 
spontaneously. 
A 
movement 
thus 
localised 
constitutes 
a 
mere 
riot. 


Revolution 
is 
easy 
when 
the 
leaders 
are 
very 
influential. 
Of 
this 
Portugal 



and 
Brazil 
have 
recently 
furnished 
proofs. 
But 
new 
ideas 
penetrate 
the 
people 
very 
slowly 
indeed. 
Generally 
it 
accepts 
a 
revolution 
without 
knowing 
why, 
and 
when 
by 
chance 
it 
does 
succeed 
in 
understanding 
why, 
the 
revolution 
is 
over 
long 
ago. 


The 
people 
will 
create 
a 
revolution 
because 
it 
is 
persuaded 
to 
do 
so, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
understand 
very 
much 
of 
the 
ideas 
of 
its 
leaders; 
it 
interprets 
them 
in 
its 
own 
fashion, 
and 
this 
fashion 
is 
by 
no 
means 
that 
of 
the 
true 
authors 
of 
the 
revolution. 
The 
French 
Revolution 
furnished 
a 
striking 
example 
of 
this 
fact. 


The 
Revolution 
of 
1789 
had 
as 
its 
real 
object 
the 
substitution 
of 
the 
power 
of 
the 
nobility 
by 
that 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie; 
that 
is, 
an 
old 
elite 
which 
had 
become 
incapable 
was 
to 
be 
replaced 
by 
a 
new 
elite 
which 
did 
possess 
capacity. 


There 
was 
little 
question 
of 
the 
people 
in 
this 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
Revolution. 
The 
sovereignty 
of 
the 
people 
was 
proclaimed, 
but 
it 
amounted 
only 
to 
the 
right 
of 
electing 
its 
representatives. 


Extremely 
illiterate, 
not 
hoping, 
like 
the 
middle 
classes, 
to 
ascend 
the 
social 
scale, 
not 
in 
any 
way 
feeling 
itself 
the 
equal 
of 
the 
nobles, 
and 
not 
aspiring 
ever 
to 
become 
their 
equal, 
the 
people 
had 
views 
and 
interests 
very 
different 
to 
those 
of 
the 
upper 
classes 
of 
society. 


The 
struggles 
of 
the 
assembly 
with 
the 
royal 
power 
led 
it 
to 
call 
for 
the 
intervention 
of 
the 
people 
in 
these 
struggles. 
It 
intervened 
more 
and 
more, 
and 
the 
bourgeois 
revolution 
rapidly 
became 
a 
popular 
revolution. 


An 
idea 
having 
no 
force 
of 
its 
own, 
and 
acting 
only 
by 
virtue 
of 
possessing 
an 
affective 
and 
mystic 
substratum 
which 
supports 
it, 
the 
theoretical 
ideas 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
before 
they 
could 
act 
on 
the 
people, 
had 
to 
be 
transformed 
into 
a 
new 
and 
very 
definite 
faith, 
springing 
from 
obvious 
practical 
interests. 


This 
transformation 
was 
rapidly 
effected 
when 
the 
people 
heard 
the 
men 
envisaged 
by 
it 
as 
the 
Government 
assuring 
it 
that 
it 
was 
the 
equal 
of 
its 
former 
masters. 
It 
began 
to 
regard 
itself 
as 
a 
victim, 
and 
proceeded 
to 
pillage, 
burn, 
and 
massacre, 
imagining 
that 
in 
so 
doing 
it 
was 
exercising 
a 
right. 


The 
great 
strength 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
principles 
was 
that 
they 
gave 
a 
free 
course 
to 
the 
instincts 
of 
primitive 
barbarity 
which 
had 
been 
restrained 
by 
the 
secular 
and 
inhibitory 
action 
of 
environment, 
tradition, 
and 
law. 


All 
the 
social 
bonds 
that 
formerly 
contained 
the 
multitude 
were 
day 
by 
day 
dissolving, 
so 
that 
it 
conceived 
a 
notion 
of 
unlimited 
power, 
and 
the 
joy 
of 
seeing 
its 
ancient 
masters 
ferreted 
out 
and 
despoiled. 
Having 
become 
the 



sovereign 
people, 
were 
not 
all 
things 
permissible 
to 
it? 


The 
motto 
of 
Liberty, 
Equality, 
Fraternity, 
a 
true 
manifestation 
of 
hope 
and 
faith 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
soon 
merely 
served 
to 
cover 
a 
legal 
justification 
of 
the 
sentiments 
of 
jealousy, 
cupidity, 
and 
hatred 
of 
superiors, 
the 
true 
motives 
of 
crowds 
unrestrained 
by 
discipline. 
This 
is 
why 
the 
Revolution 
so 
soon 
ended 
in 
disorder, 
violence, 
and 
anarchy. 


From 
the 
moment 
when 
the 
Revolution 
descended 
from 
the 
middle 
to 
the 
lower 
classes 
of 
society, 
it 
ceased 
to 
be 
a 
domination 
of 
the 
instinctive 
by 
the 
rational, 
and 
became, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
effort 
of 
the 
instinctive 
to 
overpower 
the 
rational. 


This 
legal 
triumph 
of 
the 
atavistic 
instincts 
was 
terrible. 
The 
whole 
effort 
of 
societies 
an 
effort 
indispensable 
to 
their 
continued 
existence—had 
always 
been 
to 
restrain, 
thanks 
to 
the 
power 
of 
tradition, 
customs, 
and 
codes, 
certain 
natural 
instincts 
which 
man 
has 
inherited 
from 
his 
primitive 
animality. 
It 
is 
possible 
to 
dominate 
them—and 
the 
more 
a 
people 
does 
overcome 
them 
the 
more 
civilised 
it 
is—but 
they 
cannot 
be 
destroyed. 
The 
influence 
of 
various 
exciting 
causes 
will 
readily 
result 
in 
their 
reappearance. 


This 
is 
why 
the 
liberation 
of 
popular 
passions 
is 
so 
dangerous. 
The 
torrent, 
once 
escaped 
from 
its 
bed, 
does 
not 
return 
until 
it 
has 
spread 
devastation 
far 
and 
wide. 
``Woe 
to 
him 
who 
stirs 
up 
the 
dregs 
of 
a 
nation,'' 
said 
Rivarol 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Revolution. 
``There 
is 
no 
age 
of 
enlightenment 
for 
the 
populace.'' 


3. 
The 
supposed 
Part 
of 
the 
People 
during 
Revolution. 
The 
laws 
of 
the 
psychology 
of 
crowds 
show 
us 
that 
the 
people 
never 
acts 
without 
leaders, 
and 
that 
although 
it 
plays 
a 
considerable 
part 
in 
revolutions 
by 
following 
and 
exaggerating 
the 
impulses 
received, 
it 
never 
directs 
its 
own 
movements. 


In 
all 
political 
revolutions 
we 
discover 
the 
action 
of 
leaders. 
They 
do 
not 
create 
the 
ideas 
which 
serve 
as 
the 
basis 
of 
revolutions, 
but 
they 
utilise 
them 
as 
a 
means 
of 
action. 
Ideas, 
leaders, 
armies, 
and 
crowds 
constitute 
four 
elements 
which 
all 
have 
their 
part 
to 
play 
in 
revolutions. 


The 
crowd, 
roused 
by 
the 
leaders, 
acts 
especially 
by 
means 
of 
its 
mass. 
Its 
action 
is 
comparable 
to 
that 
of 
the 
shell 
which 
perforates 
an 
armour-plate 
by 
the 
momentum 
of 
a 
force 
it 
did 
not 
create. 
Rarely 
does 
the 
crowd 
understand 



anything 
of 
the 
revolutions 
accomplished 
with 
its 
assistance. 
It 
obediently 
follows 
its 
leaders 
without 
even 
trying 
to 
find 
out 
what 
they 
want. 
It 
overthrew 
Charles 
X. 
because 
of 
his 
Ordinances 
without 
having 
any 
idea 
of 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
latter, 
and 
would 
have 
been 
greatly 
embarrassed 
had 
it 
been 
asked 
at 
a 
later 
date 
why 
it 
overthrew 
Louis-Philippe. 


Deceived 
by 
appearances, 
many 
authors, 
from 
Michelet 
to 
Aulard, 
have 
supposed 
that 
the 
people 
effected 
our 
great 
Revolution. 


``The 
principal 
actor,'' 
said 
Michelet, 
``is 
the 
people.'' 


``It 
is 
an 
error 
to 
say,'' 
writes 
M. 
Aulard, 
``that 
the 
French 
Revolution 
was 
effected 
by 
a 
few 
distinguished 
people 
or 
a 
few 
heroes. 
. 
. 
. 
I 
believe 
that 
in 
the 
whole 
history 
of 
the 
period 
included 
between 
1789 
and 
1799 
not 
a 
single 
person 
stands 
out 
who 
led 
or 
shaped 
events: 
neither 
Louis 
XVI. 
nor 
Mirabeau 
nor 
Danton 
nor 
Robespierre. 
Must 
we 
say 
that 
it 
was 
the 
French 
people 
that 
was 
the 
real 
hero 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution? 
Yes—provided 
we 
see 
the 
French 
people 
not 
as 
a 
multitude 
but 
as 
a 
number 
of 
organised 
groups.'' 


And 
in 
a 
recent 
work 
M. 
A. 
Cochin 
insists 
on 
this 
conception 
of 
popular 
action. 


``And 
here 
is 
the 
wonder: 
Michelet 
is 
right. 
In 
proportion 
as 
we 
know 
them 
better 
the 
facts 
seem 
to 
consecrate 
the 
fiction: 
this 
crowd, 
without 
chiefs 
and 
without 
laws, 
the 
very 
image 
of 
chaos, 
did 
for 
five 
years 
govern 
and 
command, 
speak 
and 
act, 
with 
a 
precision, 
a 
consistency, 
and 
an 
entirety 
that 
were 
marvellous. 
Anarchy 
gave 
lessons 
in 
order 
and 
discipline 
to 
the 
defeated 
party 
of 
order 
. 
. 
. 
twenty-five 
millions 
of 
men, 
spread 
over 
an 
area 
of 
30,000 
square 
leagues, 
acted 
as 
one.'' 


Certainly 
if 
this 
simultaneous 
conduct 
of 
the 
people 
had 
been 
spontaneous, 
as 
the 
author 
supposes, 
it 
would 
have 
been 
marvellous. 
M. 
Aulard 
himself 
understands 
very 
well 
the 
impossibilities 
of 
such 
a 
phenomenon, 
for 
he 
is 
careful, 
in 
speaking 
of 
the 
people, 
to 
say 
that 
he 
is 
speaking 
of 
groups, 
and 
that 
these 
groups 
may 
have 
been 
guided 
by 
leaders: 
— 


``And 
what, 
then, 
cemented 
the 
national 
unity? 
Who 
saved 
this 
nation, 
attacked 
by 
the 
king 
and 
rent 
by 
civil 
war? 
Was 
it 
Danton? 
Was 
it 
Robespierre? 
Was 
it 
Carnot? 
Certainly 
these 
individual 
men 
were 
of 
service: 
but 
unity 
was 
in 
fact 
maintained 
and 
independence 
assured 
by 
the 
grouping 
of 
the 
French 
into 
communes 
and 
popular 
societies—people's 
clubs. 
It 
was 
the 
municipal 
and 
Jacobin 
organisation 
of 
France 
that 
forced 
the 
coalition 
of 
Europe 
to 
retreat. 
But 
in 
each 
group, 
if 
we 
look 
more 
closely, 
there 
were 
two 



or 
three 
individuals 
more 
capable 
than 
the 
rest, 
who, 
whether 
leaders 
or 
led, 
executed 
decisions 
and 
had 
the 
appearance 
of 
leaders, 
but 
who 
(if, 
for 
instance, 
we 
read 
the 
proceedings 
of 
the 
people's 
clubs) 
seem 
to 
us 
to 
have 
drawn 
their 
strength 
far 
more 
from 
their 
group 
than 
from 
themselves. 


M. 
Aulard's 
mistake 
consists 
in 
supposing 
that 
all 
these 
groups 
were 
derived 
``from 
a 
spontaneous 
movement 
of 
fraternity 
and 
reason.'' 
France 
at 
that 
time 
was 
covered 
with 
thousands 
of 
little 
clubs, 
receiving 
a 
single 
impulsion 
from 
the 
great 
Jacobin 
Club 
of 
Paris, 
and 
obeying 
it 
with 
perfect 
docility. 
This 
is 
what 
reality 
teaches 
us, 
though 
the 
illusions 
of 
the 
Jacobins 
do 
not 
permit 
them 
to 
accept 
the 
fact.[3] 
[3] 
In 
the 
historical 
manuals 
which 
M. 
Aulard 
has 
prepared 
for 
the 
use 
of 
classes 
in 
collaboration 
with 
M. 
Debidour 
the 
role 
attributed 
to 
the 
people 
as 
an 
entity 
is 
even 
more 
marked. 
We 
see 
it 
intervening 
continually 
and 
spontaneously; 
here 
are 
a 
few 
examples:— 
The 
``Day'' 
of 
June 
the 
20th: 
``The 
king 
dismissed 
the 
Girondist 
members. 
The 
people 
of 
Paris, 
indignant, 
rose 
spontaneously 
and 
invaded 
the 
Tuileries.'' 


The 
``Day'' 
of 
August 
10th: 
``The 
Legislative 
Assembly 
dared 
not 
overthrow 
it; 
it 
was 
the 
people 
of 
Paris, 
aided 
by 
the 
Federals 
of 
the 
Departments, 
who 
effected 
this 
revolution 
at 
the 
price 
of 
its 
blood.'' 


The 
conflict 
of 
the 
Girondists 
and 
the 
Mountain: 
``This 
discord 
in 
the 
face 
of 
the 
enemy 
was 
dangerous. 
The 
people 
put 
an 
end 
to 
it 
on 
the 
days 
of 
the 
31st 
of 
May 
and 
the 
2nd 
of 
June, 
1793, 
when 
it 
forced 
the 
Convention 
to 
expel 
the 
leaders 
of 
the 
Gironde 
from 
its 
midst 
and 
to 
decree 
their 
arrest.'' 


4. 
The 
Popular 
Entity 
and 
its 
Constituent 
Elements. 
In 
order 
to 
answer 
to 
certain 
theoretical 
conceptions 
the 
people 
was 
erected 
into 
a 
mystic 
entity, 
endowed 
with 
all 
the 
powers 
and 
all 
the 
virtues, 
incessantly 
praised 
by 
the 
politicians, 
and 
overwhelmed 
with 
flattery. 
We 
shall 
see 
what 
we 
are 
to 
make 
of 
this 
conception 
of 
the 
part 
played 
by 
the 
people 
in 
the 
French 
Revolution. 



To 
the 
Jacobins 
of 
this 
epoch, 
as 
to 
those 
of 
our 
own 
days, 
this 
popular 
entity 
constitutes 
a 
superior 
personality 
possessing 
the 
attributes, 
peculiar 
to 
divinities, 
of 
never 
having 
to 
answer 
for 
its 
actions 
and 
never 
making 
a 
mistake. 
Its 
wishes 
must 
be 
humbly 
acceded. 
The 
people 
may 
kill, 
burn, 
ravage, 
commit 
the 
most 
frightful 
cruelties, 
glorify 
its 
hero 
to-day 
and 
throw 
him 
into 
the 
gutter 
to-morrow; 
it 
is 
all 
one; 
the 
politicians 
will 
not 
cease 
to 
vaunt 
its 
virtues, 
its 
high 
wisdom, 
and 
to 
bow 
to 
its 
every 
decision.[4] 


[4] 
These 
pretensions 
do 
at 
least 
seem 
to 
be 
growing 
untenable 
to 
the 
more 
advanced 
republicans. 
``The 
rage 
with 
the 
socialists'' 
writes 
M. 
Clemenceau, 
``is 
to 
endow 
with 
all 
the 
virtues, 
as 
though 
by 
a 
superhuman 
reason, 
the 
crowd 
whose 
reason 
cannot 
be 
much 
to 
boast 
of.'' 
The 
famous 
statesman 
might 
say 
more 
correctly 
that 
reason 
not 
only 
cannot 
be 
prominent 
in 
the 
crowd 
but 
is 
practically 
nonexistent. 


Now 
in 
what 
does 
this 
entity 
really 
consist, 
this 
mysterious 
fetich 
which 
revolutionists 
have 
revered 
for 
more 
than 
a 
century? 


It 
may 
be 
decomposed 
into 
two 
distinct 
categories. 
The 
first 
includes 
the 
peasants, 
traders, 
and 
workers 
of 
all 
sorts 
who 
need 
tranquillity 
and 
order 
that 
they 
may 
exercise 
their 
calling. 
This 
people 
forms 
the 
majority, 
but 
a 
majority 
which 
never 
caused 
a 
revolution. 
Living 
in 
laborious 
silence, 
it 
is 
ignored 
by 
the 
historians. 


The 
second 
category, 
which 
plays 
a 
capital 
part 
in 
all 
national 
disturbances, 
consists 
of 
a 
subversive 
social 
residue 
dominated 
by 
a 
criminal 
mentality. 
Degenerates 
of 
alcoholism 
and 
poverty, 
thieves, 
beggars, 
destitute 
``casuals,'' 
indifferent 
workers 
without 
employment—these 
constitute 
the 
dangerous 
bulk 
of 
the 
armies 
of 
insurrection. 


The 
fear 
of 
punishment 
prevents 
many 
of 
them 
from 
becoming 
criminals 
at 
ordinary 
times, 
but 
they 
do 
become 
criminals 
as 
soon 
as 
they 
can 
exercise 
their 
evil 
instincts 
without 
danger. 


To 
this 
sinister 
substratum 
are 
due 
the 
massacres 
which 
stain 
all 
revolutions. 



It 
was 
this 
class 
which, 
guided 
by 
its 
leaders, 
continually 
invaded 
the 
great 
revolutionary 
Assemblies. 
These 
regiments 
of 
disorder 
had 
no 
other 
ideal 
than 
that 
of 
massacre, 
pillage, 
and 
incendiarism. 
Their 
indifference 
to 
theories 
and 
principles 
was 
complete. 


To 
the 
elements 
recruited 
from 
the 
lowest 
dregs 
of 
the 
populace 
are 
added, 
by 
way 
of 
contagion, 
a 
host 
of 
idle 
and 
indifferent 
persons 
who 
are 
simply 
drawn 
into 
the 
movement. 
They 
shout 
because 
there 
are 
men 
shouting, 
and 
revolt 
because 
there 
is 
a 
revolt, 
without 
having 
the 
vaguest 
idea 
of 
the 
cause 
of 
shouting 
or 
revolution. 
The 
suggestive 
power 
of 
their 
environment 
absolutely 
hypnotises 
them, 
and 
impels 
them 
to 
action. 


These 
noisy 
and 
maleficent 
crowds, 
the 
kernel 
of 
all 
insurrections, 
from 
antiquity 
to 
our 
own 
times, 
are 
the 
only 
crowds 
known 
to 
the 
orator. 
To 
the 
orator 
they 
are 
the 
sovereign 
people. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
this 
sovereign 
people 
is 
principally 
composed 
of 
the 
lower 
populace 
of 
whom 
Thiers 
said:— 


``Since 
the 
time 
when 
Tacitus 
saw 
it 
applaud 
the 
crimes 
of 
the 
emperors 
the 
vile 
populace 
has 
not 
changed. 
These 
barbarians 
who 
swarm 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
societies 
are 
always 
ready 
to 
stain 
the 
people 
with 
every 
crime, 
at 
the 
beck 
of 
every 
power, 
and 
to 
the 
dishonour 
of 
every 
cause.'' 


At 
no 
period 
of 
history 
was 
the 
role 
of 
the 
lowest 
elements 
of 
the 
population 
exercised 
in 
such 
a 
lasting 
fashion 
as 
in 
the 
French 
Revolution. 


The 
massacres 
began 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
beast 
was 
unchained—that 
is, 
from 
1789, 
long 
before 
the 
Convention. 
They 
were 
carried 
out 
with 
all 
possible 
refinements 
of 
cruelty. 
During 
the 
killing 
of 
September 
the 
prisoners 
were 
slowly 
chopped 
to 
bits 
by 
sabre-cuts 
in 
order 
to 
prolong 
their 
agonies 
and 
amuse 
the 
spectators, 
who 
experienced 
the 
greatest 
delight 
before 
the 
spectacle 
of 
the 
convulsions 
of 
the 
victims 
and 
their 
shrieks 
of 
agony. 


Similar 
scenes 
were 
observed 
all 
over 
France, 
even 
in 
the 
early 
days 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
although 
the 
foreign 
war 
did 
not 
excuse 
them 
then, 
nor 
any 
other 
pretext. 


From 
March 
to 
September 
a 
whole 
series 
of 
burnings, 
killings, 
and 
pillagings 
drenched 
all 
France 
in 
blood. 
Taine 
cites 
one 
hundred 
and 
twenty 
such 
cases. 
Rouen, 
Lyons, 
Strasbourg, 
&c., 
fell 
into 
the 
power 
of 
the 
populace. 


The 
Mayor 
of 
Troyes, 
his 
eyes 
destroyed 
by 
blows 
of 
scissors, 
was 
murdered 
after 
hours 
of 
suffering. 
The 
Colonel 
of 
Dragoons 
Belzuce 
was 
cut 
to 
pieces 
while 
living. 
In 
many 
places 
the 
hearts 
of 
the 
victims 
were 
torn 
out 
and 
carried 
about 
the 
cities 
on 
the 
point 
of 
a 
pike. 



Such 
is 
the 
behaviour 
of 
the 
base 
populace 
so 
soon 
as 
imprudent 
hands 
have 
broken 
the 
network 
of 
constraints 
which 
binds 
its 
ancestral 
savagery. 
It 
meets 
with 
every 
indulgence 
because 
it 
is 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
politicians 
to 
flatter 
it. 
But 
let 
us 
for 
a 
moment 
suppose 
the 
thousands 
of 
beings 
who 
constitute 
it 
condensed 
into 
one 
single 
being. 
The 
personality 
thus 
formed 
would 
appear 
as 
a 
cruel 
and 
narrow 
and 
abominable 
monster, 
more 
horrible 
than 
the 
bloodiest 
tyrants 
of 
history. 


This 
impulsive 
and 
ferocious 
people 
has 
always 
been 
easily 
dominated 
so 
soon 
as 
a 
strong 
power 
has 
opposed 
it. 
If 
its 
violence 
is 
unlimited, 
so 
is 
its 
servility. 
All 
the 
despotisms 
have 
had 
it 
for 
their 
servant. 
The 
Caesars 
are 
certain 
of 
being 
acclaimed 
by 
it, 
whether 
they 
are 
named 
Caligula, 
Nero, 
Marat, 
Robespierre, 
or 
Boulanger. 


Beside 
these 
destructive 
hordes 
whose 
action 
during 
revolution 
is 
capital, 
there 
exists, 
as 
we 
have 
already 
remarked, 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
true 
people, 
which 
asks 
only 
the 
right 
to 
labour. 
It 
sometimes 
benefits 
by 
revolutions, 
but 
never 
causes 
them. 
The 
revolutionary 
theorists 
know 
little 
of 
it 
and 
distrust 
it, 
aware 
of 
its 
traditional 
and 
conservative 
basis. 
The 
resistant 
nucleus 
of 
a 
country, 
it 
makes 
the 
strength 
and 
continuity 
of 
the 
latter. 


Extremely 
docile 
through 
fear, 
easily 
influenced 
by 
its 
leaders, 
it 
will 
momentarily 
commit 
every 
excess 
while 
under 
their 
influence, 
but 
the 
ancestral 
inertia 
of 
the 
race 
will 
soon 
take 
charge 
again, 
which 
is 
the 
reason 
why 
it 
so 
quickly 
tires 
of 
revolution. 
Its 
traditional 
soul 
quickly 
incites 
it 
to 
oppose 
itself 
to 
anarchy 
when 
the 
latter 
goes 
too 
far. 
At 
such 
times 
it 
seeks 
the 
leader 
who 
will 
restore 
order. 


This 
people, 
resigned 
and 
peaceable, 
has 
evidently 
no 
very 
lofty 
nor 
complicated 
political 
conceptions. 
Its 
governmental 
ideal 
is 
always 
very 
simple, 
is 
something 
very 
like 
dictatorship. 
This 
is 
why, 
from 
the 
times 
of 
the 
Greeks 
to 
our 
own, 
dictatorship 
has 
always 
followed 
anarchy. 
It 
followed 
it 
after 
the 
first 
Revolution, 
when 
Bonaparte 
was 
acclaimed, 
and 
again 
when, 
despite 
opposition, 
four 
successive 
plebiscites 
raised 
Louis 
Napoleon 
to 
the 
head 
of 
the 
republic, 
ratified 
his 
coup 
d'etat, 
re-established 
the 
Empire, 
and 
in 
1870, 
before 
the 
war, 
approved 
of 
his 
rule. 


Doubtless 
in 
these 
last 
instances 
the 
people 
was 
deceived. 
But 
without 
the 
revolutionary 
conspiracies 
which 
led 
to 
disorder, 
it 
would 
not 
have 
been 
impelled 
to 
seek 
the 
means 
of 
escape 
therefrom. 


The 
facts 
recalled 
in 
this 
chapter 
must 
not 
be 
forgotten 
if 
we 
wish 
fully 
to 
comprehend 
the 
various 
roles 
of 
the 
people 
during 
revolution. 
Its 
action 
is 



considerable, 
but 
very 
unlike 
that 
imagined 
by 
the 
legends 
whose 
repetition 
alone 
constitutes 
their 
vitality.

THE 
FORMS 
OF 
MENTALITY 
PREVALENT 
DURING 
REVOLUTION 


CHAPTER 
I 


INDIVIDUAL 
VARIATIONS 
OF 
CHARACTER 
IN 
TIME 
OF 
REVOLUTION 


1. 
Transformations 
of 
Personality. 
I 
have 
dwelt 
at 
length 
elsewhere 
upon 
a 
certain 
theory 
of 
character, 
without 
which 
it 
is 
absolutely 
impossible 
to 
understand 
divers 
transformations 
or 
inconsistencies 
of 
conduct 
which 
occur 
at 
certain 
moments, 
notably 
in 
time 
of 
revolution. 
Here 
are 
the 
principal 
points 
of 
this 
theory: 


Every 
individual 
possesses, 
besides 
his 
habitual 
mentality, 
which, 
when 
the 
environment 
does 
not 
alter, 
is 
almost 
constant, 
various 
possibilities 
of 
character 
which 
may 
be 
evoked 
by 
passing 
events. 


The 
people 
who 
surround 
us 
are 
the 
creatures 
of 
certain 
circumstances, 
but 
not 
of 
all 
circumstances. 
Our 
ego 
consists 
of 
the 
association 
of 
innumerable 
cellular 
egos, 
the 
residues 
of 
ancestral 
personalities. 
By 
their 
combination 
they 
form 
an 
equilibrium 
which 
is 
fairly 
permanent 
when 
the 
social 
environment 
does 
not 
vary. 
As 
soon 
as 
this 
environment 
is 
considerably 
modified, 
as 
in 
time 
of 
insurrection, 
this 
equilibrium 
is 
broken, 
and 
the 
dissociated 
elements 
constitute, 
by 
a 
fresh 
aggregation, 
a 
new 
personality, 
which 
is 
manifested 
by 
ideas, 
feelings, 
and 
actions 
very 
different 
from 
those 
formerly 
observed 
in 
the 
same 
individual. 
Thus 
it 
is 
that 
during 
the 
Terror 
we 
see 
honest 
bourgeois 
and 
peaceful 
magistrates 
who 
were 
noted 
for 
their 
kindness 
turned 
into 
bloodthirsty 
fanatics. 


Under 
the 
influence 
of 
environment 
the 
old 
personality 
may 
therefore 
give 
place 
to 
one 
entirely 
new. 
For 
this 
reason 
the 
actors 
in 
great 
religious 
and 
political 
crises 
often 
seem 
of 
a 
different 
essence 
to 
ourselves; 
yet 
they 
do 
not 
differ 
from 
us; 
the 
repetition 
of 
the 
same 
events 
would 
bring 
back 
the 



same 
men. 


Napoleon 
perfectly 
understood 
these 
possibilities 
of 
character 
when 
he 
said, 
in 
Saint 
Helena:— 


``It 
is 
because 
I 
know 
just 
how 
great 
a 
part 
chance 
plays 
in 
our 
political 
decisions, 
that 
I 
have 
always 
been 
without 
prejudices, 
and 
very 
indulgent 
as 
to 
the 
part 
men 
have 
taken 
during 
our 
disturbances. 
. 
. 
. 
In 
time 
of 
revolution 
one 
can 
only 
say 
what 
one 
has 
done; 
it 
would 
not 
be 
wise 
to 
say 
that 
one 
could 
not 
have 
done 
otherwise. 
. 
. 
. 
Men 
are 
difficult 
to 
understand 
if 
we 
want 
to 
be 
just. 
. 
. 
. 
Do 
they 
know 
themselves? 
Do 
they 
account 
for 
themselves 
very 
clearly? 
There 
are 
virtues 
and 
vices 
of 
circumstance.'' 


When 
the 
normal 
personality 
has 
been 
disaggregated 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
certain 
events, 
how 
does 
the 
new 
personality 
form 
itself? 
By 
several 
means, 
the 
most 
active 
of 
which 
is 
the 
acquisition 
of 
a 
strong 
belief. 
This 
orientates 
all 
the 
elements 
of 
the 
understanding, 
as 
the 
magnet 
collects 
into 
regular 
curves 
the 
filings 
of 
a 
magnetic 
metal. 


Thus 
were 
formed 
the 
personalities 
observed 
in 
times 
of 
great 
crises: 
the 
Crusades, 
the 
Reformation, 
the 
Revolution 
notably. 


At 
normal 
times 
the 
environment 
varies 
little, 
so 
that 
as 
a 
rule 
we 
see 
only 
a 
single 
personality 
in 
the 
individuals 
that 
surround 
us. 
Sometimes, 
however, 
it 
happens 
that 
we 
observe 
several, 
which 
in 
certain 
circumstances 
may 
replace 
one 
another. 


These 
personalities 
may 
be 
contradictory 
and 
even 
inimical. 
This 
phenomenon, 
exceptional 
under 
normal 
conditions, 
is 
considerably 
accentuated 
in 
certain 
pathological 
conditions. 
Morbid 
psychology 
has 
recorded 
several 
examples 
of 
multiple 
personality 
in 
a 
single 
subject, 
such 
as 
the 
cases 
cited 
by 
Morton 
Prince 
and 
Pierre 
Janet. 


In 
all 
these 
variations 
of 
personality 
it 
is 
not 
the 
intelligence 
which 
is 
modified, 
but 
the 
feelings, 
whose 
association 
forms 
the 
character. 


2. 
Elements 
of 
Character 
Predominant 
in 
Time 
of 
Revolution. 
During 
revolution 
we 
see 
several 
sentiments 
developed 
which 
are 
commonly 
repressed, 
but 
to 
which 
the 
destruction 
of 
social 
constraints 
gives 
a 
free 
vent. 


These 
constraints, 
consisting 
of 
the 
law, 
morality, 
and 
tradition, 
are 
not 
always 
completely 
broken. 
Some 
survive 
the 
upheaval 
and 
serve 
to 
some 



extent 
to 
damp 
the 
explosion 
of 
dangerous 
sentiments. 


The 
most 
powerful 
of 
these 
restraints 
is 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
race. 
This 
determines 
a 
manner 
of 
seeing, 
feeling, 
and 
willing 
common 
to 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
individuals 
of 
the 
same 
people; 
it 
constitutes 
a 
hereditary 
custom, 
and 
nothing 
is 
more 
powerful 
than 
the 
ties 
of 
custom. 


This 
racial 
influence 
limits 
the 
variations 
of 
a 
people 
and 
determines 
its 
destiny 
within 
certain 
limits 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
superficial 
changes. 


For 
example, 
to 
take 
only 
the 
instances 
of 
history, 
it 
would 
seem 
that 
the 
mentality 
of 
France 
must 
have 
varied 
enormously 
during 
a 
single 
century. 
In 
a 
few 
years 
it 
passed 
from 
the 
Revolution 
to 
Caesarism, 
returned 
to 
the 
monarchy, 
effected 
another 
Revolution, 
and 
then 
summoned 
a 
new 
Caesar. 
In 
reality 
only 
the 
outsides 
of 
things 
had 
changed. 


We 
cannot 
insist 
further 
here 
on 
the 
limits 
of 
national 
variability, 
but 
must 
now 
consider 
the 
influence 
of 
certain 
affective 
elements, 
whose 
development 
during 
revolution 
contributes 
to 
modify 
individual 
or 
collective 
personalities. 
In 
particular 
I 
will 
mention 
hatred, 
fear, 
ambition, 
jealousy 
or 
envy, 
vanity, 
and 
enthusiasm. 
We 
observe 
their 
influence 
during 
several 
of 
the 
upheavals 
of 
history, 
notably 
during 
the 
course 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution, 
which 
will 
furnish 
us 
with 
most 
of 
our 
examples. 


Hatred.—The 
hatred 
of 
persons, 
institutions, 
and 
things 
which 
animated 
the 
men 
of 
the 
Revolution 
is 
one 
of 
these 
affective 
phenomena 
which 
are 
the 
more 
striking 
the 
more 
one 
studies 
their 
psychology. 
They 
detested, 
not 
only 
their 
enemies, 
but 
the 
members 
of 
their 
own 
party. 
``If 
one 
were 
to 
accept 
unreservedly,'' 
said 
a 
recent 
writer, 
``the 
judgments 
which 
they 
expressed 
of 
one 
another, 
we 
should 
have 
to 
conclude 
that 
they 
were 
all 
traitors 
and 
boasters, 
all 
incapable 
and 
corrupt, 
all 
assassins 
or 
tyrants.'' 
We 
know 
with 
what 
hatred, 
scarcely 
appeased 
by 
the 
death 
of 
their 
enemies, 
men 
persecuted 
the 
Girondists, 
Dantonists, 
Hebertists, 
Robespierrists, 
&c. 


One 
of 
the 
chief 
causes 
of 
this 
feeling 
resided 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
these 
furious 
sectaries, 
being 
apostles 
in 
possession 
of 
the 
absolute 
verity, 
were 
unable, 
like 
all 
believers, 
to 
tolerate 
the 
sight 
of 
infidels. 
A 
mystic 
or 
sentimental 
certitude 
is 
always 
accompanied 
by 
the 
need 
of 
forcing 
itself 
on 
others, 
is 
never 
convinced, 
and 
does 
not 
shrink 
from 
wholesale 
slaughter 
when 
it 
has 
the 
power 
to 
commit 
it. 


If 
the 
hatreds 
that 
divided 
the 
men 
of 
the 
Revolution 
had 
been 
of 
rational 
origin 
they 
would 
not 
have 
lasted 
long, 
but, 
arising 
from 
affective 
and 
mystic 
factors, 
men 
could 
neither 
forget 
nor 
forgive. 
Their 
sources 
being 
identical 
in 



the 
different 
parties, 
they 
manifested 
themselves 
on 
every 
hand 
with 
identical 
violence. 


It 
has 
been 
proved, 
by 
means 
of 
documents, 
that 
the 
Girondists 
were 
no 
less 
sanguinary 
than 
the 
Montagnards. 
They 
were 
the 
first 
to 
declare, 
with 
Petion, 
that 
the 
vanquished 
parties 
should 
perish. 
They 
also, 
according 
to 
M. 
Aulard, 
attempted 
to 
justify 
the 
massacres 
of 
September. 
The 
Terror 
must 
not 
be 
considered 
simply 
as 
a 
means 
of 
defence, 
but 
as 
the 
general 
process 
of 
destruction 
to 
which 
triumphant 
believers 
have 
always 
treated 
their 
detested 
enemies. 
Men 
who 
can 
put 
up 
with 
the 
greatest 
divergence 
of 
ideas 
cannot 
tolerate 
differences 
of 
belief. 


In 
religious 
or 
political 
warfare 
the 
vanquished 
can 
hope 
for 
no 
quarter. 
From 
Sulla, 
who 
cut 
the 
throats 
of 
two 
hundred 
senators 
and 
five 
or 
six 
thousand 
Romans, 
to 
the 
men 
who 
suppressed 
the 
Commune, 
and 
shot 
down 
more 
than 
twenty 
thousand 
after 
their 
victory, 
this 
bloody 
law 
has 
never 
failed. 
Proved 
over 
and 
over 
again 
in 
the 
past, 
it 
will 
doubtless 
be 
so 
in 
the 
future. 


The 
hatreds 
of 
the 
Revolution 
did 
not 
arise 
entirely 
from 
divergence 
of 
belief. 
Other 
sentiments—envy, 
ambition, 
and 
self-love—also 
engendered 
them. 
The 
rivalry 
of 
individuals 
aspiring 
to 
power 
led 
the 
chiefs 
of 
the 
various 
groups 
in 
succession 
to 
the 
scaffold. 


We 
must 
remember, 
moreover, 
that 
the 
need 
of 
division 
and 
the 
hatred 
resulting 
therefrom 
seem 
to 
be 
constituent 
elements 
of 
the 
Latin 
mind. 
They 
cost 
our 
Gaulish 
ancestors 
their 
independence, 
and 
had 
already 
struck 
Caesar. 


``No 
city,'' 
he 
said, 
``but 
was 
divided 
into 
two 
factions; 
no 
canton, 
no 
village, 
no 
house 
in 
which 
the 
spirit 
of 
party 
did 
not 
breathe. 
It 
was 
very 
rarely 
that 
a 
year 
went 
by 
without 
a 
city 
taking 
up 
arms 
to 
attack 
or 
repulse 
its 
neighbours.'' 


As 
man 
has 
only 
recently 
entered 
upon 
the 
age 
of 
knowledge, 
and 
has 
always 
hitherto 
been 
guided 
by 
sentiments 
and 
beliefs, 
we 
may 
conceive 
the 
vast 
importance 
of 
hatred 
as 
a 
factor 
of 
his 
history. 


Commandant 
Colin, 
professor 
at 
the 
College 
of 
War, 
remarks 
in 
the 
following 
terms 
on 
the 
importance 
of 
this 
feeling 
during 
certain 
wars:— 


``In 
war 
more 
than 
at 
any 
other 
time 
there 
is 
no 
better 
inspiring 
force 
than 
hatred; 
it 
was 
hatred 
that 
made 
Blucher 
victorious 
over 
Napoleon. 
Analyse 
the 
most 
wonderful 
manoeuvres, 
the 
most 
decisive 
operations, 
and 
if 
they 
are 
not 
the 
work 
of 
an 
exceptional 
man, 
a 
Frederick 
or 
a 
Napoleon, 
you 
will 
find 
they 
are 
inspired 
by 
passion 
more 
than 
by 
calculation. 
What 
would 
the 
war 
of 



1870 
have 
been 
without 
the 
hatred 
which 
we 
bore 
the 
Germans?'' 


The 
writer 
might 
have 
added 
that 
the 
intense 
hatred 
of 
the 
Japanese 
for 
the 
Russians, 
who 
had 
so 
humiliated 
them, 
might 
be 
classed 
among 
the 
causes 
of 
their 
success. 
The 
Russian 
soldiers, 
ignorant 
of 
the 
very 
existence 
of 
the 
Japanese, 
had 
no 
animosity 
against 
them, 
which 
was 
one 
of 
the 
reasons 
of 
their 
failure. 


There 
was 
assuredly 
a 
good 
deal 
of 
talk 
of 
fraternity 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
and 
there 
is 
even 
more 
to-day. 
Pacificism, 
humanitarianism, 
and 
solidarity 
have 
become 
catchwords 
of 
the 
advanced 
parties, 
but 
we 
know 
how 
profound 
are 
the 
hatreds 
concealed 
beneath 
these 
terms, 
and 
what 
dangers 
overhang 
our 
modern 
society. 


Fear.—Fear 
plays 
almost 
as 
large 
a 
part 
in 
revolutions 
as 
hatred. 
During 
the 
French 
Revolution 
there 
were 
many 
examples 
of 
great 
individual 
courage 
and 
many 
exhibitions 
of 
collective 
cowardice. 


Facing 
the 
scaffold, 
the 
men 
of 
the 
Convention 
were 
always 
brave 
in 
the 
extreme; 
but 
before 
the 
threats 
of 
the 
rioters 
who 
invaded 
the 
Assembly 
they 
constantly 
exhibited 
an 
excessive 
pusillanimity, 
obeying 
the 
most 
absurd 
injunctions, 
as 
we 
shall 
see 
if 
we 
re-read 
the 
history 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
Assemblies. 


All 
the 
forms 
of 
fear 
were 
observed 
at 
this 
period. 
One 
of 
the 
most 
widespread 
was 
the 
fear 
of 
appearing 
moderate. 
Members 
of 
the 
Assemblies, 
public 
prosecutors, 
representatives 
``on 
mission,'' 
judges 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
tribunals, 
&c., 
all 
sought 
to 
appear 
more 
advanced 
than 
their 
rivals. 
Fear 
was 
one 
of 
the 
principal 
elements 
of 
the 
crimes 
committed 
at 
this 
period. 
If 
by 
some 
miracle 
it 
could 
have 
been 
eliminated 
from 
the 
revolutionary 
Assemblies, 
their 
conduct 
would 
have 
been 
quite 
other 
than 
it 
was, 
and 
the 
Revolution 
itself 
would 
have 
taken 
a 
very 
different 
direction. 


Ambition, 
Envy, 
Vanity, 
&c.—In 
normal 
times 
the 
influence 
of 
these 
various 
affective 
elements 
is 
forcibly 
contained 
by 
social 
necessities. 
Ambition, 
for 
instance, 
is 
necessarily 
limited 
in 
a 
hierarchical 
form 
of 
society. 
Although 
the 
soldier 
does 
sometimes 
become 
a 
general, 
it 
is 
only 
after 
a 
long 
term 
of 
service. 
In 
time 
of 
revolution, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
there 
is 
no 
need 
to 
wait. 
Every 
one 
may 
reach 
the 
upper 
ranks 
almost 
immediately, 
so 
that 
all 
ambitions 
are 
violently 
aroused. 
The 
humblest 
man 
believes 
himself 
fitted 
for 
the 
highest 
employments, 
and 
by 
this 
very 
fact 
his 
vanity 
grows 
out 
of 
all 
measure. 


All 
the 
passions 
being 
more 
or 
less 
aroused, 
including 
ambition 
and 



vanity, 
we 
see 
the 
development 
of 
jealousy 
and 
envy 
of 
those 
who 
have 
succeeded 
more 
quickly 
than 
others. 


The 
effect 
of 
jealousy, 
always 
important 
in 
times 
of 
revolution, 
was 
especially 
so 
during 
the 
great 
French 
Revolution. 
Jealousy 
of 
the 
nobility 
constituted 
one 
of 
its 
most 
important 
factors. 
The 
middle 
classes 
had 
increased 
in 
capacity 
and 
wealth, 
to 
the 
point 
of 
surpassing 
the 
nobility. 
Although 
they 
mingled 
with 
the 
nobles 
more 
and 
more, 
they 
felt, 
none 
the 
less, 
that 
they 
were 
held 
at 
a 
distance, 
and 
this 
they 
keenly 
resented. 
This 
frame 
of 
mind 
had 
unconsciously 
made 
the 
bourgeoisie 
keen 
supporters 
of 
the 
philosophic 
doctrine 
of 
equality. 


Wounded 
self-love 
and 
jealousy 
were 
thus 
the 
causes 
of 
hatreds 
that 
we 
can 
scarcely 
conceive 
today, 
when 
the 
social 
influence 
of 
the 
nobility 
is 
so 
small. 
Many 
members 
of 
the 
Convention—Carrier, 
Marat, 
and 
others— 
remembered 
with 
anger 
that 
they 
had 
once 
occupied 
subordinate 
positions 
in 
the 
establishments 
of 
great 
nobles. 
Mme. 
Roland 
was 
never 
able 
to 
forget 
that, 
when 
she 
and 
her 
mother 
were 
invited 
to 
the 
house 
of 
a 
great 
lady 
under 
the 
ancien 
regime, 
they 
had 
been 
sent 
to 
dine 
in 
the 
servants' 
quarters. 


The 
philosopher 
Rivarol 
has 
very 
well 
described 
in 
the 
following 
passage, 
already 
cited 
by 
Taine, 
the 
influence 
of 
wounded 
self-love 
and 
jealousy 
upon 
the 
revolutionary 
hatreds:— 


``It 
is 
not,'' 
he 
writes, 
``the 
taxes, 
nor 
the 
lettres 
de 
cachet, 
nor 
any 
of 
the 
other 
abuses 
of 
authority; 
it 
is 
not 
the 
sins 
of 
the 
intendants, 
nor 
the 
long 
and 
ruinous 
delays 
of 
justice, 
that 
has 
most 
angered 
the 
nation; 
it 
is 
the 
prejudices 
of 
the 
nobility 
for 
which 
it 
has 
exhibited 
the 
greatest 
hatred. 
What 
proves 
this 
clearly 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
is 
the 
bourgeois, 
the 
men 
of 
letters, 
the 
men 
of 
money, 
in 
fact 
all 
those 
who 
are 
jealous 
of 
the 
nobility, 
who 
have 
raised 
the 
poorer 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
cities 
against 
them, 
and 
the 
peasants 
in 
the 
country 
districts.'' 


This 
very 
true 
statement 
partly 
justifies 
the 
saying 
of 
Napoleon: 


``Vanity 
made 
the 
Revolution; 
liberty 
was 
only 
the 
pretext.'' 


Enthusiasm.—The 
enthusiasm 
of 
the 
founders 
of 
the 
Revolution 
equalled 
that 
of 
the 
apostles 
of 
the 
faith 
of 
Mohammed. 
And 
it 
was 
really 
a 
religion 
that 
the 
bourgeois 
of 
the 
first 
Assembly 
thought 
to 
found. 
They 
thought 
to 
have 
destroyed 
an 
old 
world, 
and 
to 
have 
built 
a 
new 
one 
upon 
its 
ruins. 
Never 
did 
illusion 
more 
seductive 
fire 
the 
hearts 
of 
men. 
Equality 
and 
fraternity, 
proclaimed 
by 
the 
new 
dogmas, 
were 
to 
bring 
the 
reign 
of 
eternal 
happiness 
to 
all 
the 
peoples. 
Man 
had 
broken 
for 
ever 
with 
a 
past 
of 
barbarity 



and 
darkness. 
The 
regenerated 
world 
would 
in 
future 
be 
illuminated 
by 
the 
lucid 
radiance 
of 
pure 
reason. 
On 
all 
hands 
the 
most 
brilliant 
oratorical 
formulae 
saluted 
the 
expected 
dawn. 


That 
this 
enthusiasm 
was 
so 
soon 
replaced 
by 
violence 
was 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
awakening 
was 
speedy 
and 
terrible. 
One 
can 
readily 
conceive 
the 
indignant 
fury 
with 
which 
the 
apostles 
of 
the 
Revolution 
attacked 
the 
daily 
obstacles 
opposed 
to 
the 
realisation 
of 
their 
dreams. 
They 
had 
sought 
to 
reject 
the 
past, 
to 
forget 
tradition, 
to 
make 
man 
over 
again. 
But 
the 
past 
reappeared 
incessantly, 
and 
men 
refused 
to 
change. 
The 
reformers, 
checked 
in 
their 
onward 
march, 
would 
not 
give 
in. 
They 
sought 
to 
impose 
by 
force 
a 
dictatorship 
which 
speedily 
made 
men 
regret 
the 
system 
abolished, 
and 
finally 
led 
to 
its 
return. 


It 
is 
to 
be 
remarked 
that 
although 
the 
enthusiasm 
of 
the 
first 
days 
did 
not 
last 
in 
the 
revolutionary 
Assemblies, 
it 
survived 
very 
much 
longer 
in 
the 
armies, 
and 
constituted 
their 
chief 
strength. 
To 
tell 
the 
truth, 
the 
armies 
of 
the 
Revolution 
were 
republican 
long 
before 
France 
became 
so, 
and 
remained 
republican 
long 
after 
France 
had 
ceased 
to 
be 
so. 


The 
variations 
of 
character 
considered 
in 
this 
chapter, 
being 
conditioned 
by 
certain 
common 
aspirations 
and 
identical 
changes 
of 
environment, 
finally 
became 
concrete 
in 
a 
small 
number 
of 
fairly 
homogeneous 
mentalities. 
Speaking 
only 
of 
the 
more 
characteristic, 
we 
may 
refer 
them 
to 
four 
types: 
the 
Jacobin, 
mystic, 
revolutionary, 
and 
criminal 
mentalities. 


CHAPTER 
II 


THE 
MYSTIC 
MENTALITY 
AND 
THE 
JACOBIN 
MENTALITY 


1. 
Classification 
of 
Mentalities 
predominant 
in 
Time 
of 
Revolution. 
The 
classifications 
without 
which 
the 
study 
of 
the 
sciences 
is 
impossible 
must 
necessarily 
establish 
the 
discontinuous 
in 
the 
continuous, 
and 
for 
that 
reason 
are 
to 
a 
certain 
extent 
artificial. 
But 
they 
are 
necessary, 
since 
the 
continuous 
is 
only 
accessible 
in 
the 
form 
of 
the 
discontinuous. 


To 
create 
broad 
distinctions 
between 
the 
various 
mentalities 
observable 
in 
time 
of 
revolution, 
as 
we 
are 
about 
to 
do, 
is 
obviously 
to 
separate 
elements 
which 
encroach 
upon 
one 
another, 
which 
are 
fused 
or 
superimposed. 
We 



must 
resign 
ourselves 
to 
losing 
a 
little 
in 
exactitude 
in 
order 
to 
gain 
in 
lucidity. 
The 
fundamental 
types 
enumerated 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
preceding 
chapter, 
and 
which 
we 
are 
about 
to 
describe, 
synthetise 
groups 
which 
would 
escape 
analysis 
were 
we 
to 
attempt 
to 
study 
them 
in 
all 
their 
complexity. 


We 
have 
shown 
that 
man 
is 
influenced 
by 
different 
logics, 
which 
under 
normal 
conditions 
exist 
in 
juxtaposition, 
without 
mutually 
influencing 
one 
another. 
Under 
the 
action 
of 
various 
events 
they 
enter 
into 
mutual 
conflict, 
and 
the 
irreducible 
differences 
which 
divide 
them 
are 
visibly 
manifested, 
involving 
considerable 
individual 
and 
social 
upheavals. 


Mystic 
logic, 
which 
we 
shall 
presently 
consider 
as 
it 
appears 
in 
the 
Jacobin 
mind, 
plays 
a 
very 
important 
part. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
alone 
in 
its 
action. 
The 
other 
forms 
of 
logic—affective 
logic, 
collective 
logic, 
and 
rational 
logic 
—may 
predominate 
according 
to 
circumstances. 


2. 
The 
Mystic 
Mentality. 
Leaving 
aside 
for 
the 
moment 
the 
influence 
of 
affective, 
rational, 
and 
collective 
logic, 
we 
will 
occupy 
ourselves 
solely 
with 
the 
considerable 
part 
played 
by 
the 
mystic 
elements 
which 
have 
prevailed 
in 
so 
many 
revolutions, 
and 
notably 
in 
the 
French 
Revolution. 


The 
chief 
characteristic 
of 
the 
mystic 
temperament 
consists 
in 
the 
attribution 
of 
a 
mysterious 
power 
to 
superior 
beings 
or 
forces, 
which 
are 
incarnated 
in 
the 
form 
of 
idols, 
fetiches, 
words, 
or 
formulae. 


The 
mystic 
spirit 
is 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
all 
the 
religious 
and 
most 
political 
beliefs. 
These 
latter 
would 
often 
vanish 
could 
we 
deprive 
them 
of 
the 
mystic 
elements 
which 
are 
their 
chief 
support. 


Grafted 
on 
the 
sentiments 
and 
passionate 
impulses 
which 
it 
directs, 
mystic 
logic 
constitutes 
the 
might 
of 
the 
great 
popular 
movements. 
Men 
who 
would 
be 
by 
no 
means 
ready 
to 
allow 
themselves 
to 
be 
killed 
for 
the 
best 
of 
reasons 
will 
readily 
sacrifice 
their 
lives 
to 
a 
mystic 
ideal 
which 
has 
become 
an 
object 
of 
adoration. 


The 
principles 
of 
the 
Revolution 
speedily 
inspired 
a 
wave 
of 
mystic 
enthusiasm 
analogous 
to 
those 
provoked 
by 
the 
various 
religious 
beliefs 
which 
had 
preceded 
it. 
All 
they 
did 
was 
to 
change 
the 
orientation 
of 
a 
mental 
ancestry 
which 
the 
centuries 
had 
solidified. 


So 
there 
is 
nothing 
astonishing 
in 
the 
savage 
zeal 
of 
the 
men 
of 
the 



Convention. 
Their 
mystic 
mentality 
was 
the 
same 
as 
that 
of 
the 
Protestants 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Reformation. 
The 
principal 
heroes 
of 
the 
Terror—Couthon, 
Saint-Just, 
Robespierre, 
&c.—were 
Apostles. 
Like 
Polyeuctes, 
destroying 
the 
altars 
of 
the 
false 
gods 
to 
propagate 
his 
faith, 
they 
dreamed 
of 
converting 
the 
globe. 
Their 
enthusiasm 
spilled 
itself 
over 
the 
earth. 
Persuaded 
that 
their 
magnificent 
formulae 
were 
sufficient 
to 
overturn 
thrones, 
they 
did 
not 
hesitate 
to 
declare 
war 
upon 
kings. 
And 
as 
a 
strong 
faith 
is 
always 
superior 
to 
a 
doubtful 
faith, 
they 
victoriously 
faced 
all 
Europe. 


The 
mystic 
spirit 
of 
the 
leaders 
of 
the 
Revolution 
was 
betrayed 
in 
the 
least 
details 
of 
their 
public 
life. 
Robespierre, 
convinced 
that 
he 
was 
supported 
by 
the 
Almighty, 
assured 
his 
hearers 
in 
a 
speech 
that 
the 
Supreme 
Being 
had 
``decreed 
the 
Republic 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
time.'' 
In 
his 
quality 
of 
High 
Pontiff 
of 
a 
State 
religion 
he 
made 
the 
Convention 
vote 
a 
decree 
declaring 
that 
``the 
French 
People 
recognises 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
Supreme 
Being 
and 
the 
immortality 
of 
the 
soul.'' 
At 
the 
festival 
of 
this 
Supreme 
Being, 
seated 
on 
a 
kind 
of 
throne, 
he 
preached 
a 
lengthy 
sermon. 


The 
Jacobin 
Club, 
directed 
by 
Robespierre, 
finally 
assumed 
all 
the 
functions 
of 
a 
council. 
There 
Maximilien 
proclaimed 
``the 
idea 
of 
a 
Great 
Being 
who 
watches 
over 
oppressed 
innocence 
and 
who 
punishes 
triumphant 
crime.'' 


All 
the 
heretics 
who 
criticised 
the 
Jacobin 
orthodoxy 
were 
excommunicated—that 
is, 
were 
sent 
to 
the 
Revolutionary 
Tribunal, 
which 
they 
left 
only 
for 
the 
scaffold. 


The 
mystic 
mentality 
of 
which 
Robespierre 
was 
the 
most 
celebrated 
representative 
did 
not 
die 
with 
him. 
Men 
of 
identical 
mentality 
are 
to 
be 
found 
among 
the 
French 
politicians 
of 
to-day. 
The 
old 
religious 
beliefs 
no 
longer 
rule 
their 
minds, 
but 
they 
are 
the 
creatures 
of 
political 
creeds 
which 
they 
would 
very 
soon 
force 
on 
others, 
as 
did 
Robespierre, 
if 
they 
had 
the 
chance 
of 
so 
doing. 
Always 
ready 
to 
kill 
if 
killing 
would 
spread 
their 
faith, 
the 
mystics 
of 
all 
ages 
have 
employed 
the 
same 
means 
of 
persuasion 
as 
soon 
as 
they 
have 
become 
the 
masters. 


It 
is 
therefore 
quite 
natural 
that 
Robespierre 
should 
still 
have 
many 
admirers. 
Minds 
moulded 
like 
his 
are 
to 
be 
met 
with 
in 
their 
thousands. 
His 
conceptions 
were 
not 
guillotined 
with 
him. 
Old 
as 
humanity, 
they 
will 
only 
disappear 
with 
the 
last 
believer. 


This 
mystic 
aspect 
of 
all 
revolutions 
has 
escaped 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
historians. 
They 
will 
persist 
for 
a 
long 
time 
yet 
in 
trying 
to 
explain 
by 
means 



of 
rational 
logic 
a 
host 
of 
phenomena 
which 
have 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
reason. 
I 
have 
already 
cited 
a 
passage 
from 
the 
history 
of 
MM. 
Lavisse 
and 
Rambaud, 
in 
which 
the 
Reformation 
is 
explained 
as 
``the 
result 
of 
the 
free 
individual 
reflections 
suggested 
to 
simple 
folk 
by 
an 
extremely 
pious 
conscience, 
and 
a 
bold 
and 
courageous 
reason.'' 


Such 
movements 
are 
never 
comprehended 
by 
those 
who 
imagine 
that 
their 
origin 
is 
rational. 
Political 
or 
religious, 
the 
beliefs 
which 
have 
moved 
the 
world 
possess 
a 
common 
origin 
and 
follow 
the 
same 
laws. 
They 
are 
formed, 
not 
by 
the 
reason, 
but 
more 
often 
contrary 
to 
reason. 
Buddhism, 
Christianity, 
Islamism, 
the 
Reformation, 
sorcery, 
Jacobinism, 
socialism, 
spiritualism, 
&c., 
seem 
very 
different 
forms 
of 
belief, 
but 
they 
have, 
I 
repeat, 
identical 
mystic 
and 
affective 
bases, 
and 
obey 
forms 
of 
logic 
which 
have 
no 
affinity 
with 
rational 
logic. 
Their 
might 
resides 
precisely 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
reason 
has 
as 
little 
power 
to 
create 
them 
as 
to 
transform 
them. 


The 
mystic 
mentality 
of 
our 
modern 
political 
apostles 
is 
strongly 
marked 
in 
an 
article 
dealing 
with 
one 
of 
our 
recent 
ministers, 
which 
I 
cite 
from 
a 
leading 
journal: 


``One 
may 
ask 
into 
what 
category 
does 
M. 
A——fall? 
Could 
we 
say, 
for 
instance, 
that 
he 
belongs 
to 
the 
group 
of 
unbelievers? 
Far 
from 
it! 
Certainly 


M. 
A—— 
has 
not 
adopted 
any 
positive 
faith; 
certainly 
he 
curses 
Rome 
and 
Geneva, 
rejecting 
all 
the 
traditional 
dogmas 
and 
all 
the 
known 
Churches. 
But 
if 
he 
makes 
a 
clean 
sweep 
it 
is 
in 
order 
to 
found 
his 
own 
Church 
on 
the 
ground 
so 
cleared, 
a 
Church 
more 
dogmatic 
than 
all 
the 
rest; 
and 
his 
own 
inquisition, 
whose 
brutal 
intolerance 
would 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
envy 
the 
most 
notorious 
of 
Torquemadas. 
`` 
`We 
cannot,' 
he 
says, 
`allow 
such 
a 
thing 
as 
scholastic 
neutrality. 
We 
demand 
lay 
instruction 
in 
all 
its 
plenitude, 
and 
are 
consequently 
the 
enemies 
of 
educational 
liberty.' 
If 
he 
does 
not 
suggest 
erecting 
the 
stake 
and 
the 
pyre, 
it 
is 
only 
on 
account 
of 
the 
evolution 
of 
manners, 
which 
he 
is 
forced 
to 
take 
into 
account 
to 
a 
certain 
extent, 
whether 
he 
will 
or 
no. 
But, 
not 
being 
able 
to 
commit 
men 
to 
the 
torture, 
he 
invokes 
the 
secular 
arm 
to 
condemn 
their 
doctrines 
to 
death. 
This 
is 
exactly 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
great 
inquisitors. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
attack 
upon 
thought. 
This 
freethinker 
has 
so 
free 
a 
spirit 
that 
every 
philosophy 
he 
does 
not 
accept 
appears 
to 
him, 
not 
only 
ridiculous 
and 
grotesque, 
but 
criminal. 
He 
flatters 
himself 
that 
he 
alone 
is 
in 
possession 
of 
the 
absolute 
truth. 
Of 
this 
he 
is 
so 
entirely 
sure 
that 
everyone 
who 
contradicts 
him 
seems 
to 
him 
an 
execrable 
monster 
and 
a 
public 
enemy. 
He 
does 
not 



suspect 
for 
a 
moment 
that 
after 
all 
his 
personal 
views 
are 
only 
hypotheses, 
and 
that 
he 
is 
all 
the 
more 
laughable 
for 
claiming 
a 
Divine 
right 
for 
them 
precisely 
because 
they 
deny 
divinity. 
Or, 
at 
least, 
they 
profess 
to 
do 
so; 
but 
they 
re-establish 
it 
in 
another 
shape, 
which 
immediately 
makes 
one 
regret 
the 
old. 
M. 
A—— 
is 
a 
sectary 
of 
the 
goddess 
Reason, 
of 
whom 
he 
has 
made 
a 
Moloch, 
an 
oppressive 
deity 
hungry 
for 
sacrifice. 
No 
more 
liberty 
of 
thought 
for 
any 
one 
except 
for 
himself 
and 
his 
friends; 
such 
is 
the 
free 
thought 
of 
M. 
A——. 
The 
outlook 
is 
truly 
attractive. 
But 
perhaps 
too 
many 
idols 
have 
been 
cast 
down 
during 
the 
last 
few 
centuries 
for 
men 
to 
bow 
before 
this 
one.'' 


We 
must 
hope 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
liberty 
that 
these 
gloomy 
fanatics 
will 
never 
finally 
become 
our 
masters. 


Given 
the 
silent 
power 
of 
reason 
over 
mystic 
beliefs, 
it 
is 
quite 
useless 
to 
seek 
to 
discuss, 
as 
is 
so 
often 
done, 
the 
rational 
value 
of 
revolutionary 
or 
political 
ideas. 
Only 
their 
influence 
can 
interest 
us. 
It 
matters 
little 
that 
the 
theories 
of 
the 
supposed 
equality 
of 
men, 
the 
original 
goodness 
of 
mankind, 
the 
possibility 
of 
re-making 
society 
by 
means 
of 
laws, 
have 
been 
given 
the 
lie 
by 
observation 
and 
experience. 
These 
empty 
illusions 
must 
be 
counted 
among 
the 
most 
potent 
motives 
of 
action 
that 
humanity 
has 
known. 


3. 
The 
Jacobin 
Mentality. 
Although 
the 
term 
``Jacobin 
mentality'' 
does 
not 
really 
belong 
to 
any 
true 
classification, 
I 
employ 
it 
here 
because 
it 
sums 
up 
a 
clearly 
defined 
combination 
which 
constitutes 
a 
veritable 
psychological 
species. 


This 
mentality 
dominates 
the 
men 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution, 
but 
is 
not 
peculiar 
to 
them, 
as 
it 
still 
represents 
one 
of 
the 
most 
active 
elements 
in 
our 
politics. 


The 
mystic 
mentality 
which 
we 
have 
already 
considered 
is 
an 
essential 
factor 
of 
the 
Jacobin 
mind, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
in 
itself 
enough 
to 
constitute 
that 
mind. 
Other 
elements, 
which 
we 
shall 
now 
examine, 
must 
be 
added. 


The 
Jacobins 
do 
not 
in 
the 
least 
suspect 
their 
mysticism. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
they 
profess 
to 
be 
guided 
solely 
by 
pure 
reason. 
During 
the 
Revolution 
they 
invoked 
reason 
incessantly, 
and 
considered 
it 
as 
their 
only 
guide 
to 
conduct. 


The 
majority 
of 
historians 
have 
adopted 
this 
rationalist 
conception 
of 
the 
Jacobin 
mind, 
and 
Taine 
fell 
into 
the 
same 
error. 
It 
is 
in 
the 
abuse 
of 
rationalism 
that 
he 
seeks 
the 
origin 
of 
a 
great 
proportion 
of 
the 
acts 
of 
the 



Jacobins. 
The 
pages 
in 
which 
he 
has 
dealt 
with 
the 
subject 
contain 
many 
truths, 
however, 
and 
as 
they 
are 
in 
other 
ways 
very 
remarkable, 
I 
reproduce 
the 
most 
important 
passages 
here:— 


``Neither 
exaggerated 
self-love 
nor 
dogmatic 
reasoning 
is 
rare 
in 
the 
human 
species. 
In 
all 
countries 
these 
two 
roots 
of 
the 
Jacobin 
spirit 
subsist, 
secret 
and 
indestructible. 
. 
. 
. 
At 
twenty 
years 
of 
age, 
when 
a 
young 
man 
is 
entering 
into 
the 
world, 
his 
reason 
is 
stimulated 
simultaneously 
with 
his 
pride. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
whatever 
society 
he 
may 
move 
in, 
it 
is 
contemptible 
to 
pure 
reason, 
for 
it 
has 
not 
been 
constructed 
by 
a 
philosophic 
legislator 
according 
to 
a 
principle, 
but 
successive 
generations 
have 
arranged 
it 
according 
to 
their 
multiple 
and 
ever-changing 
needs. 
It 
is 
not 
the 
work 
of 
logic, 
but 
of 
history, 
and 
the 
young 
reasoner 
shrugs 
his 
shoulders 
at 
the 
sight 
of 
this 
old 
building, 
whose 
site 
is 
arbitrary, 
whose 
architecture 
is 
incoherent, 
and 
whose 
inconveniences 
are 
obvious. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
majority 
of 
young 
people, 
above 
all 
those 
who 
have 
their 
way 
to 
make, 
are 
more 
or 
less 
Jacobin 
on 
leaving 
college. 
. 
. 
. 
Jacobinism 
is 
born 
of 
social 
decomposition 
just 
as 
mushrooms 
are 
born 
of 
a 
fermenting 
soil. 
Consider 
the 
authentic 
monuments 
of 
its 
thought—the 
speeches 
of 
Robespierre 
and 
Saint-Just, 
the 
debates 
of 
the 
Legislative 
Assembly 
and 
the 
Convention, 
the 
harangues, 
addresses, 
and 
reports 
of 
Girondists 
and 
Montagnards. 
Never 
did 
men 
speak 
so 
much 
to 
say 
so 
little; 
the 
empty 
verbiage 
and 
swollen 
emphasis 
swamp 
any 
truth 
there 
may 
be 
beneath 
their 
monotony 
and 
their 
turgidity. 
The 
Jacobin 
is 
full 
of 
respect 
for 
the 
phantoms 
of 
his 
reasoning 
brain; 
in 
his 
eyes 
they 
are 
more 
real 
than 
living 
men, 
and 
their 
suffrage 
is 
the 
only 
suffrage 
he 
recognises—he 
will 
march 
onward 
in 
all 
sincerity 
at 
the 
head 
of 
a 
procession 
of 
imaginary 
followers. 
The 
millions 
of 
metaphysical 
wills 
which 
he 
has 
created 
in 
the 
image 
of 
his 
own 
will 
sustain 
him 
by 
their 
unanimous 
assent, 
and 
he 
will 
project 
outwards, 
like 
a 
chorus 
of 
triumph 
and 
acclamation, 
the 
inward 
echo 
of 
his 
own 
voice.'' 


While 
admiring 
Taine's 
description, 
I 
think 
he 
has 
not 
exactly 
grasped 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
Jacobin. 


The 
mind 
of 
the 
true 
Jacobin, 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Revolution 
as 
now, 
was 
composed 
of 
elements 
which 
we 
must 
analyse 
if 
we 
are 
to 
understand 
its 
function. 


This 
analysis 
will 
show 
in 
the 
first 
place 
that 
the 
Jacobin 
is 
not 
a 
rationalist, 
but 
a 
believer. 
Far 
from 
building 
his 
belief 
on 
reason, 
he 
moulds 
reason 
to 
his 
belief, 
and 
although 
his 
speeches 
are 
steeped 
in 
rationalism 
he 



employs 
it 
very 
little 
in 
his 
thoughts 
and 


A 
Jacobin 
who 
reasoned 
as 
much 
as 
sometimes 
accessible 
to 
the 
voice 
of 
re 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Revolution 
to 
our 
ow 
influenced 
by 
reasoning, 
however 
jus 
strength 
resides. 


And 
why 
is 
he

PART

THE 
FRENCH 
REVOLUTION 


BOOK 
I 


THE 
ORIGINS 
OF 
THE 
FRENCH 
REVOLUTION 


CHAPTER 
I 


THE 
OPINIONS 
OF 
HISTORIANS 
CONCERNING 
THE 
FRENCH 
REVOLUTION 


1. 
The 
Historians 
of 
the 
Revolution. 
The 
most 
contradictory 
opinions 
have 
been 
expressed 
respecting 
the 
French 
Revolution, 
and 
although 
only 
a 
century 
separates 
us 
from 
the 
period 
in 
question 
it 
seems 
impossible 
as 
yet 
to 
judge 
it 
calmly. 
For 
de 
Maistre 
it 
was 
``a 
satanic 
piece 
of 
work,'' 
and 
``never 
was 
the 
action 
of 
the 
spirit 
of 
darkness 
so 
evidently 
manifested.'' 
For 
the 
modern 
Jacobins 
it 
has 
regenerated 
the 
human 
race. 


Foreigners 
who 
live 
in 
France 
still 
regard 
it 
as 
a 
subject 
to 
be 
avoided 
in 
conversation. 


``Everywhere,'' 
writes 
Barrett 
Wendell, 
``this 
memory 
and 
these 
traditions 
are 
still 
endowed 
with 
such 
vitality 
that 
few 
persons 
are 
capable 
of 
considering 
them 
dispassionately. 
They 
still 
excite 
both 
enthusiasm 
and 
resentment; 
they 
are 
still 
regarded 
with 
a 
loyal 
and 
ardent 
spirit 
of 
partisanship. 
The 
better 
you 
come 
to 
understand 
France 
the 
more 
clearly 
you 
see 
that 
even 
to-day 
no 
study 
of 
the 
Revolution 
strikes 
any 
Frenchman 
as 
having 
been 
impartial.'' 


This 
observation 
is 
perfectly 
correct. 
To 
be 
interpretable 
with 
equity, 
the 
events 
of 
the 
past 
must 
no 
longer 
be 
productive 
of 
results 
and 
must 
not 
touch 
the 
religious 
or 
political 
beliefs 
whose 
inevitable 
intolerance 
I 
have 
denoted. 



We 
must 
not 
therefore 
be 
surprised 
that 
historians 
express 
very 
different 
ideas 
respecting 
the 
Revolution. 
For 
a 
long 
time 
to 
come 
some 
will 
still 
see 
in 
it 
one 
of 
the 
most 
sinister 
events 
of 
history, 
while 
to 
others 
it 
will 
remain 
one 
of 
the 
most 
glorious. 


All 
writers 
on 
the 
subject 
have 
believed 
that 
they 
have 
related 
its 
course 
with 
impartiality, 
but 
in 
general 
they 
have 
merely 
supported 
contradictory 
theories 
of 
peculiar 
simplicity. 
The 
documents 
being 
innumerable 
and 
contradictory, 
their 
conscious 
or 
unconscious 
choice 
has 
readily 
enabled 
them 
to 
justify 
their 
respective 
theories. 


The 
older 
historians 
of 
the 
Revolution—Thiers, 
Quinet, 
and, 
despite 
his 
talent, 
Michelet 
himself, 
are 
somewhat 
eclipsed 
to-day. 
Their 
doctrines 
were 
by 
no 
means 
complicated; 
a 
historic 
fatalism 
prevails 
generally 
in 
their 
work. 
Thiers 
regarded 
the 
Revolution 
as 
the 
result 
of 
several 
centuries 
of 
absolute 
monarchy, 
and 
the 
Terror 
as 
the 
necessary 
consequence 
of 
foreign 
invasion. 
Quinet 
described 
the 
excesses 
of 
1793 
as 
the 
result 
of 
a 
long-continued 
despotism, 
but 
declared 
that 
the 
tyranny 
of 
the 
Convention 
was 
unnecessary, 
and 
hampered 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Revolution. 
Michelet 
saw 
in 
this 
last 
merely 
the 
work 
of 
the 
people, 
whom 
he 
blindly 
admired, 
and 
commenced 
the 
glorification 
continued 
by 
other 
historians. 


The 
former 
reputation 
of 
all 
these 
historians 
has 
been 
to 
a 
great 
extent 
effaced 
by 
that 
of 
Taine. 
Although 
equally 
impassioned, 
he 
threw 
a 
brilliant 
light 
upon 
the 
revolutionary 
period, 
and 
it 
will 
doubtless 
be 
long 
before 
his 
work 
is 
superseded. 


Work 
so 
important 
is 
bound 
to 
show 
faults. 
Taine 
is 
admirable 
in 
the 
representation 
of 
facts 
and 
persons, 
but 
he 
attempts 
to 
judge 
by 
the 
standard 
of 
rational 
logic 
events 
which 
were 
not 
dictated 
by 
reason, 
and 
which, 
therefore, 
he 
cannot 
interpret. 
His 
psychology, 
excellent 
when 
it 
is 
merely 
descriptive, 
is 
very 
weak 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
becomes 
explanatory. 
To 
affirm 
that 
Robespierre 
was 
a 
pedantic 
``swotter'' 
is 
not 
to 
reveal 
the 
causes 
of 
his 
absolute 
power 
over 
the 
Convention, 
at 
a 
time 
when 
he 
had 
spent 
several 
months 
in 
decimating 
it 
with 
perfect 
impunity. 
It 
has 
very 
justly 
been 
said 
of 
Taine 
that 
he 
saw 
well 
and 
understood 
little. 


Despite 
these 
restrictions 
his 
work 
is 
highly 
remarkable 
and 
has 
not 
been 
equalled. 
We 
may 
judge 
of 
his 
immense 
influence 
by 
the 
exasperation 
which 
he 
causes 
among 
the 
faithful 
defenders 
of 
Jacobin 
orthodoxy, 
of 
which 
M. 
Aulard, 
professor 
at 
the 
Sorbonne, 
is 
to-day 
the 
high 
priest. 
The 
latter 
has 
devoted 
two 
years 
to 
writing 
a 
pamphlet 
against 
Taine, 
every 
line 
of 
which 
is 



steeped 
in 
passion. 
All 
this 
time 
spent 
in 
rectifying 
a 
few 
material 
errors 
which 
are 
not 
really 
significant 
has 
only 
resulted 
in 
the 
perpetration 
of 
the 
very 
same 
errors. 


Reviewing 
his 
work, 
M. 
A. 
Cochin 
shows 
that 
M. 
Aulard 
has 
at 
least 
on 
every 
other 
occasion 
been 
deceived 
by 
his 
quotations, 
whereas 
Taine 
erred 
far 
more 
rarely. 
The 
same 
historian 
shows 
also 
that 
we 
must 
not 
trust 
M. 
Aulard's 
sources. 


``These 
sources—proceedings, 
pamphlets, 
journals, 
and 
the 
speeches 
and 
writings 
of 
patriots—are 
precisely 
the 
authentic 
publications 
of 
patriotism, 
edited 
by 
patriots, 
and 
edited, 
as 
a 
rule, 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
public. 
He 
ought 
to 
have 
seen 
in 
all 
this 
simply 
the 
special 
pleading 
of 
the 
defendant: 
he 
had, 
before 
his 
eyes, 
a 
ready-made 
history 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
which 
presents, 
side 
by 
side 
with 
each 
of 
the 
acts 
of 
the 
`People,' 
from 
the 
massacres 
of 
September 
to 
the 
law 
of 
Prairial, 
a 
ready-made 
explanation 
according 
to 
the 
republican 
system 
of 
defence.'' 


Perhaps 
the 
fairest 
criticism 
that 
one 
can 
make 
of 
the 
work 
of 
Taine 
is 
that 
it 
was 
left 
incomplete. 
He 
studied 
more 
especially 
the 
role 
of 
the 
populace 
and 
its 
leaders 
during 
the 
revolutionary 
period. 
This 
inspired 
him 
with 
pages 
vibrating 
with 
an 
indignation 
which 
we 
can 
still 
admire, 
but 
several 
important 
aspects 
of 
the 
Revolution 
escaped 
him. 


Whatever 
one 
may 
think 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
an 
irreducible 
difference 
will 
always 
exist 
between 
historians 
of 
the 
school 
of 
Taine 
and 
those 
of 
the 
school 
of 
M. 
Aulard. 
The 
latter 
regards 
the 
sovereign 
people 
as 
admirable, 
while 
the 
former 
shows 
us 
that 
when 
abandoned 
to 
its 
instincts 
and 
liberated 
from 
all 
social 
restraint 
it 
relapses 
into 
primitive 
savagery. 
The 
conception 
of 
M. 
Aulard, 
entirely 
contrary 
to 
the 
lessons 
of 
the 
psychology 
of 
crowds, 
is 
none 
the 
less 
a 
religious 
dogma 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
modern 
Jacobins. 
They 
write 
of 
the 
Revolution 
according 
to 
the 
methods 
of 
believers, 
and 
take 
for 
learned 
works 
the 
arguments 
of 
virtual 
theologians. 


2. 
The 
Theory 
of 
Fatalism 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Revolution. 
Advocates 
and 
detractors 
of 
the 
Revolution 
often 
admit 
the 
fatality 
of 
revolutionary 
events. 
This 
theory 
is 
well 
synthetised 
in 
the 
following 
passage 
from 
the 
History 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
by 
Emile 
Olivier:— 


``No 
man 
could 
oppose 
it. 
The 
blame 
belongs 
neither 
to 
those 
who 
perished 
nor 
to 
those 
who 
survived; 
there 
was 
no 
individual 
force 
capable 
of 



changing 
the 
elements 
and 
of 
foreseeing 
the 
events 
which 
were 
born 
of 
the 


nature 
of 
things 
and 
circumstances.'' 


Taine 
himself 
inclines 
to 
this 
idea:— 


``At 
the 
moment 
when 
the 
States 
General 
were 
opened 
the 
course 
of 
ideas 
and 
events 
was 
not 
only 
determined 
but 
even 
visible. 
Each 
generation 
unwittingly 
bears 
within 
itself 
its 
future 
and 
its 
past; 
from 
the 
latter 
its 
destinies 
might 
have 
been 
foretold 
long 
before 
the 
issue.'' 


Other 
modern 
authors, 
who 
profess 
no 
more 
indulgence 
for 
the 
violence 
of 
the 
revolutionaries 
than 
did 
Taine, 
are 
equally 
convinced 
of 
this 
fatality. 


M. 
Sorel, 
after 
recalling 
the 
saying 
of 
Bossuet 
concerning 
the 
revolutions 
of 
antiquity: 
``Everything 
is 
surprising 
if 
we 
only 
consider 
particular 
causes, 
and 
yet 
everything 
goes 
forward 
in 
regular 
sequence,'' 
expresses 
an 
intention 
which 
he 
very 
imperfectly 
realises: 
``to 
show 
in 
the 
Revolution, 
which 
seems 
to 
some 
the 
subversion 
and 
to 
others 
the 
regeneration 
of 
the 
old 
European 
world, 
the 
natural 
and 
necessary 
result 
of 
the 
history 
of 
Europe, 
and 
to 
show, 
moreover, 
that 
this 
revolution 
had 
no 
result—not 
even 
the 
most 
unexpected— 
that 
did 
not 
ensue 
from 
this 
history, 
and 
was 
not 
explained 
by 
the 
precedents 
of 
the 
ancien 
regime.'' 
Guizot 
also 
had 
formerly 
attempted 
to 
prove 
that 
our 
Revolution, 
which 
he 
quite 
wrongly 
compared 
to 
that 
of 
England, 
was 
perfectly 
natural 
and 
effected 
no 
innovations:— 


``Far 
from 
having 
broken 
with 
the 
natural 
course 
of 
events 
in 
Europe, 
neither 
the 
English 
revolution 
nor 
our 
own 
did, 
intended, 
or 
said 
anything 
that 
had 
not 
been 
said, 
intended, 
and 
done 
a 
hundred 
years 
before 
its 
outbreak. 


`` 
. 
. 
. 
Whether 
we 
regard 
the 
general 
doctrines 
of 
the 
two 
revolutions 
or 
the 
application 
made 
of 
them—whether 
we 
deal 
with 
the 
government 
of 
the 
State 
or 
with 
the 
civil 
legislation, 
with 
property 
or 
with 
persons, 
with 
liberty 
or 
with 
power, 
we 
shall 
find 
nothing 
of 
which 
the 
invention 
can 
be 
attributed 
to 
them, 
nothing 
that 
will 
not 
be 
encountered 
elsewhere, 
or 
that 
was 
not 
at 
least 
originated 
in 
times 
which 
we 
qualify 
as 
normal.'' 


All 
these 
assertions 
merely 
recall 
the 
banal 
law 
that 
a 
phenomenon 
is 
simply 
the 
consequence 
of 
previous 
phenomena. 
Such 
very 
general 
propositions 
do 
not 
teach 
us 
much. 


We 
must 
not 
try 
to 
explain 
too 
many 
events 
by 
the 
principle 
of 
fatality 
adopted 
by 
so 
many 
historians. 
I 
have 
elsewhere 
discussed 
the 
significance 
of 
such 
fatalities, 
and 
have 
shown 
that 
the 
whole 
effort 
of 
civilisation 
consists 
in 



trying 
to 
escape 
therefrom. 
Certainly 
history 
is 
full 
of 
necessities, 
but 
it 
is 
also 
full 
of 
contingent 
facts 
which 
were, 
and 
might 
not 
have 
been. 
Napoleon 
himself, 
on 
St. 
Helena, 
enumerated 
six 
circumstances 
which 
might 
have 
checked 
his 
prodigious 
career. 
He 
related, 
notably, 
that 
on 
taking 
a 
bath 
at 
Auxonne, 
in 
1786, 
he 
only 
escaped 
death 
by 
the 
fortuitous 
presence 
of 
a 
sandbank. 
If 
Bonaparte 
had 
died, 
then 
we 
may 
admit 
that 
another 
general 
would 
have 
arisen, 
and 
might 
have 
become 
dictator. 
But 
what 
would 
have 
become 
of 
the 
Imperial 
epic 
and 
its 
consequences 
without 
the 
man 
of 
genius 
who 
led 
our 
victorious 
armies 
into 
all 
the 
capitals 
of 
Europe? 


It 
is 
permissible 
to 
consider 
the 
Revolution 
as 
being 
partly 
a 
necessity, 
but 
it 
was 
above 
all—which 
is 
what 
the 
fatalistic 
writers 
already 
cited 
do 
not 
show 
us—a 
permanent 
struggle 
between 
theorists 
who 
were 
imbued 
with 
a 
new 
ideal, 
and 
the 
economic, 
social, 
and 
political 
laws 
which 
ruled 
mankind, 
and 
which 
they 
did 
not 
understand. 
Not 
understanding 
them, 
they 
sought 
in 
vain 
to 
direct 
the 
course 
of 
events, 
were 
exasperated 
at 
their 
failure, 
and 
finally 
committed 
every 
species 
of 
violence. 
They 
decreed 
that 
the 
paper 
money 
known 
as 
assignats 
should 
be 
accepted 
as 
the 
equivalent 
of 
gold, 
and 
all 
their 
threats 
could 
not 
prevent 
the 
fictitious 
value 
of 
such 
money 
falling 
almost 
to 
nothing. 
They 
decreed 
the 
law 
of 
the 
maximum, 
and 
it 
merely 
increased 
the 
evils 
it 
was 
intended 
to 
remedy. 
Robespierre 
declared 
before 
the 
Convention 
``that 
all 
the 
sans-culottes 
will 
be 
paid 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
public 
treasury, 
which 
will 
be 
fed 
by 
the 
rich,'' 
and 
in 
spite 
of 
requisitions 
and 
the 
guillotine 
the 
treasury 
remained 
empty. 


Having 
broken 
all 
human 
restraints, 
the 
men 
of 
the 
Revolution 
finally 
discovered 
that 
a 
society 
cannot 
live 
without 
them; 
but 
when 
they 
sought 
to 
create 
them 
anew 
they 
saw 
that 
even 
the 
strongest 
society, 
though 
supported 
by 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
guillotine, 
could 
not 
replace 
the 
discipline 
which 
the 
past 
had 
slowly 
built 
up 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
men. 
As 
for 
understanding 
the 
evolution 
of 
society, 
or 
judging 
men's 
hearts 
and 
minds, 
or 
foreseeing 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
laws 
they 
enacted, 
they 
scarcely 
attempted 
to 
do 
so. 


The 
events 
of 
the 
Revolution 
did 
not 
ensue 
from 
irreducible 
necessities. 
They 
were 
far 
more 
the 
consequence 
of 
Jacobin 
principles 
than 
of 
circumstances, 
and 
might 
have 
been 
quite 
other 
than 
they 
were. 
Would 
the 
Revolution 
have 
followed 
the 
same 
path 
if 
Louis 
XVI. 
had 
been 
better 
advised, 
or 
if 
the 
Constituent 
Assembly 
had 
been 
less 
cowardly 
in 
times 
of 
popular 
insurrection? 
The 
theory 
of 
revolutionary 
fatality 
is 
only 
useful 
to 
justify 
violence 
by 
presenting 
it 
as 
inevitable. 



Whether 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
science 
or 
with 
history 
we 
must 
beware 
of 
the 
ignorance 
which 
takes 
shelter 
under 
the 
shibboleth 
of 
fatalism 
Nature 
was 
formerly 
full 
of 
a 
host 
of 
fatalities 
which 
science 
is 
slowly 
contriving 
to 
avoid. 
The 
function 
of 
the 
superior 
man 
is, 
as 
I 
have 
shown 
elsewhere, 
to 
avert 
such 
fatalities. 


3. 
The 
Hesitations 
of 
recent 
Historians 
of 
the 
Revolution. 
The 
historians 
whose 
ideas 
we 
have 
examined 
in 
the 
preceding 
chapter 
were 
extremely 
positive 
in 
their 
special 
pleading. 
Confined 
within 
the 
limits 
of 
belief, 
they 
did 
not 
attempt 
to 
penetrate 
the 
domain 
of 
knowledge. 
A 
monarchical 
writer 
was 
violently 
hostile 
to 
the 
Revolution, 
and 
a 
liberal 
writer 
was 
its 
violent 
apologist. 


At 
the 
present 
time 
we 
can 
see 
the 
commencement 
of 
a 
movement 
which 
will 
surely 
lead 
to 
the 
study 
of 
the 
Revolution 
as 
one 
of 
those 
scientific 
phenomena 
into 
which 
the 
opinions 
and 
beliefs 
of 
a 
writer 
enter 
so 
little 
that 
the 
reader 
does 
not 
even 
suspect 
them. 


This 
period 
has 
not 
yet 
come 
into 
being; 
we 
are 
still 
in 
the 
period 
of 
doubt. 
The 
liberal 
writers 
who 
used 
to 
be 
so 
positive 
are 
now 
so 
no 
longer. 
One 
may 
judge 
of 
this 
new 
state 
of 
mind 
by 
the 
following 
extracts 
from 
recent 
authors:— 


M. 
Hanotaux, 
having 
vaunted 
the 
utility 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
asks 
whether 
its 
results 
were 
not 
bought 
too 
dearly, 
and 
adds:— 
``History 
hesitates, 
and 
will, 
for 
a 
long 
time 
yet, 
hesitate 
to 
answer.'' 


M. 
Madelin 
is 
equally 
dubious 
in 
the 
book 
he 
has 
recently 
published:— 
``I 
have 
never 
felt 
sufficient 
authority 
to 
form, 
even 
in 
my 
inmost 
conscience, 
a 
categorical 
judgment 
on 
so 
complex 
a 
phenomenon 
as 
the 
French 
Revolution. 
To-day 
I 
find 
it 
even 
more 
difficult 
to 
form 
a 
brief 
judgement. 
Causes, 
facts, 
and 
consequences 
seem 
to 
me 
to 
be 
still 
extremely 
debatable 
subjects.'' 


One 
may 
obtain 
a 
still 
better 
idea 
of 
the 
transformation 
of 
the 
old 
ideas 
concerning 
the 
Revolution 
by 
perusing 
the 
latest 
writings 
of 
its 
official 
defenders. 
While 
they 
professed 
formerly 
to 
justify 
every 
act 
of 
violence 
by 
representing 
it 
as 
a 
simple 
act 
of 
defence, 
they 
now 
confine 
themselves 
to 
pleading 
extenuating 
circumstances. 
I 
find 
a 
striking 
proof 
of 
this 
new 
frame 
of 
mind 
in 
the 
history 
of 
France 
for 
the 
use 
of 
schools, 
published 
by 
MM. 



Aulard 
and 
Debidour. 
Concerning 
the 
Terror 
we 
read 
the 
following 
lines:— 


``Blood 
flowed 
in 
waves; 
there 
were 
acts 
of 
injustice 
and 
crimes 
which 
were 
useless 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
national 
defence, 
and 
odious. 
But 
men 
had 
lost 
their 
heads 
in 
the 
tempest, 
and, 
harassed 
by 
a 
thousand 
dangers, 
the 
patriots 
struck 
out 
in 
their 
rage.'' 


We 
shall 
see 
in 
another 
part 
of 
this 
work 
that 
the 
first 
of 
the 
two 
authors 
whom 
I 
have 
cited 
is, 
in 
spite 
of 
his 
uncompromising 
Jacobinism, 
by 
no 
means 
indulgent 
toward 
the 
men 
formerly 
qualified 
as 
the 
``Giants 
of 
the 
Convention.'' 


The 
judgments 
of 
foreigners 
upon 
our 
Revolution 
are 
usually 
distinctly 
severe, 
and 
we 
cannot 
be 
surprised 
when 
we 
remember 
how 
Europe 
suffered 
during 
the 
twenty 
years 
of 
upheaval 
in 
France. 


The 
Germans 
in 
particular 
have 
been 
most 
severe. 
Their 
opinion 
is 
summed 
up 
in 
the 
following 
lines 
by 
M. 
Faguet:— 


``Let 
us 
say 
it 
courageously 
and 
patriotically, 
for 
patriotism 
consists 
above 
all 
in 
telling 
the 
truth 
to 
one's 
own 
country: 
Germany 
sees 
in 
France, 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
past, 
a 
people 
who, 
with 
the 
great 
words 
`liberty' 
and 
`fraternity' 
in 
its 
mouth, 
oppressed, 
trampled, 
murdered, 
pillaged, 
and 
fleeced 
her 
for 
fifteen 
years; 
and 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
present, 
a 
people 
who, 
with 
the 
same 
words 
on 
its 
banners, 
is 
organising 
a 
despotic, 
oppressive, 
mischievous, 
and 
ruinous 
democracy, 
which 
none 
would 
seek 
to 
imitate. 
This 
is 
what 
Germany 
may 
well 
see 
in 
France; 
and 
this, 
according 
to 
her 
books 
and 
journals, 
is, 
we 
may 
assure 
ourselves, 
what 
she 
does 
see.'' 


For 
the 
rest, 
whatever 
the 
worth 
of 
the 
verdicts 
pronounced 
upon 
the 
French 
Revolution, 
we 
may 
be 
certain 
that 
the 
writers 
of 
the 
future 
will 
consider 
it 
as 
an 
event 
as 
passionately 
interesting 
as 
it 
is 
instructive. 


A 
Government 
bloodthirsty 
enough 
to 
guillotine 
old 
men 
of 
eighty 
years, 
young 
girls, 
and 
little 
children: 
which 
covered 
France 
with 
ruins, 
and 
yet 
succeeded 
in 
repulsing 
Europe 
in 
arms; 
an 
archduchess 
of 
Austria, 
Queen 
of 
France, 
dying 
on 
the 
scaffold, 
and 
a 
few 
years 
later 
another 
archduchess, 
her 
relative, 
replacing 
her 
on 
the 
same 
throne 
and 
marrying 
a 
sub-lieutenant, 
turned 
Emperor—here 
are 
tragedies 
unique 
in 
human 
history. 
The 
psychologists, 
above 
all, 
will 
derive 
lessons 
from 
a 
history 
hitherto 
so 
little 
studied 
by 
them. 
No 
doubt 
they 
will 
finally 
discover 
that 
psychology 
can 
make 
no 
progress 
until 
it 
renounces 
chimerical 
theories 
and 
laboratory 
experiments 
in 
order 
to 
study 
the 
events 
and 
the 
men 
who 
surround 
us.[7] 



[7] 
This 
advice 
is 
far 
from 
being 
banal. 
The 
psychologists 
of 
the 
day 
pay 
very 
little 
attention 
to 
the 
world 
about 
them, 
and 
are 
even 
surprised 
that 
any 
one 
should 
study 
it. 
I 
have 
come 
across 
an 
interesting 
proof 
of 
this 
indifferent 
frame 
of 
mind 
in 
a 
review 
of 
one 
of 
my 
books 
which 
appeared 
in 
the 
Revue 
philosophique 
and 
was 
inspired 
by 
the 
editor 
of 
the 
review. 
The 
author 
reproaches 
me 
with 
``exploring 
the 
world 
and 
the 
newspapers 
rather 
than 
books.'' 
I 
most 
gladly 
accept 
this 
reproach. 
The 
manifold 
facts 
of 
the 
journals 
and 
the 
realities 
of 
the 
world 
are 
far 
more 
instructive 
than 
philosophical 
lucubrations 
such 
as 
the 
Revue 
is 
stuffed 
with. 


Philosophers 
are 
beginning 
to 
see 
the 
puerility 
of 
such 
reproaches. 
It 
was 
certainly 
of 
the 
forty 
volumes 
of 
this 
fastidious 
publication 
that 
Mr. 
William 
James 
was 
thinking 
when 
he 
wrote 
that 
all 
these 
dissertations 
simply 
represented 
``a 
string 
of 
facts 
clumsily 
observed 
and 
a 
few 
quarrelsome 
discussions.'' 
Although 
he 
is 
the 
author 
of 
the 
best 
known 
treatise 
on 
psychology 
extant, 
the 
eminent 
thinker 
realises 
``the 
fragility 
of 
a 
science 
that 
oozes 
metaphysical 
criticism 
at 
every 
joint.'' 
For 
more 
than 
twenty 
years 
I 
have 
tried 
to 
interest 
psychologists 
in 
the 
study 
of 
realities, 
but 
the 
stream 
of 
university 
metaphysics 
is 
hardly 
yet 
turned 
aside, 
although 
it 
has 
lost 
its 
former 
force 


4. 
Impartiality 
in 
History. 
Impartiality 
has 
always 
been 
considered 
as 
the 
most 
essential 
quality 
of 
the 
historian. 
All 
historians 
since 
Tacitus 
have 
assured 
us 
that 
they 
are 
impartial. 


In 
reality 
the 
writer 
sees 
events 
as 
the 
painter 
sees 
a 
landscape—that 
is, 
through 
his 
own 
temperament; 
through 
his 
character 
and 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
race. 


A 
number 
of 
artists, 
placed 
before 
the 
same 
landscape, 
would 
necessarily 
interpret 
it 
in 
as 
many 
different 
fashions. 
Some 
would 
lay 
stress 
upon 
details 
neglected 
by 
others. 
Each 
reproduction 
would 
thus 
be 
a 
personal 
work—that 
is 
to 
say, 
would 
be 
interpreted 
by 
a 
certain 
form 
of 
sensibility. 


It 
is 
the 
same 
with 
the 
writer. 
We 
can 
no 
more 
speak 
of 
the 
impartiality 
of 
the 
historian 
than 
we 
can 
speak 
of 
the 
impartiality 
of 
the 
painter. 


Certainly 
the 
historian 
may 
confine 
himself 
to 
the 
reproduction 
of 



documents, 
and 
this 
is 
the 
present 
tendency. 
But 
these 
documents, 
for 
periods 
as 
near 
us 
as 
the 
Revolution, 
are 
so 
abundant 
that 
a 
man's 
whole 
life 
would 
not 
suffice 
to 
go 
through 
them. 
Therefore 
the 
historian 
must 
make 
a 
choice. 


Consciously 
sometimes, 
but 
more 
often 
unconsciously, 
the 
author 
will 
select 
the 
material 
which 
best 
corresponds 
with 
his 
political, 
moral, 
and 
social 
opinions. 


It 
is 
therefore 
impossible, 
unless 
he 
contents 
himself 
with 
simple 
chronologies 
summing 
up 
each 
event 
with 
a 
few 
words 
and 
a 
date, 
to 
produce 
a 
truly 
impartial 
volume 
of 
history. 
No 
author 
could 
be 
impartial; 
and 
it 
is 
not 
to 
be 
regretted. 
The 
claim 
to 
impartiality, 
so 
common 
to-day, 
results 
in 
those 
flat, 
gloomy, 
and 
prodigiously 
wearisome 
works 
which 
render 
the 
comprehension 
of 
a 
period 
completely 
impossible. 


Should 
the 
historian, 
under 
a 
pretext 
of 
impartiality, 
abstain 
from 
judging 
men—that 
is, 
from 
speaking 
in 
tones 
of 
admiration 
or 
reprobation? 


This 
question, 
I 
admit, 
allows 
of 
two 
very 
different 
solutions, 
each 
of 
which 
is 
perfectly 
correct, 
according 
to 
the 
point 
of 
view 
assumed—that 
of 
the 
moralist 
or 
that 
of 
the 
psychologist. 


The 
moralist 
must 
think 
exclusively 
of 
the 
interest 
of 
society, 
and 
must 
judge 
men 
only 
according 
to 
that 
interest. 
By 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
it 
exists 
and 
wishes 
to 
continue 
to 
exist 
a 
society 
is 
obliged 
to 
admit 
a 
certain 
number 
of 
rules, 
to 
have 
an 
indestructible 
standard 
of 
good 
and 
evil, 
and 
consequently 
to 
create 
very 
definite 
distinctions 
between 
vice 
and 
virtue. 
It 
thus 
finally 
creates 
average 
types, 
to 
which 
the 
man 
of 
the 
period 
approaches 
more 
or 
less 
closely, 
and 
from 
which 
he 
cannot 
depart 
very 
widely 
without 
peril 
to 
society. 


It 
is 
by 
such 
similar 
types 
and 
the 
rules 
derived 
from 
social 
necessities 
that 
the 
moralist 
must 
judge 
the 
men 
of 
the 
past. 
Praising 
those 
which 
were 
useful 
and 
blaming 
the 
rest, 
he 
thus 
helps 
to 
form 
the 
moral 
types 
which 
are 
indispensable 
to 
the 
progress 
of 
civilisation 
and 
which 
may 
serve 
others 
as 
models. 
Poets 
such 
as 
Corneille, 
for 
example, 
create 
heroes 
superior 
to 
the 
majority 
of 
men, 
and 
possibly 
inimitable; 
but 
they 
thereby 
help 
greatly 
to 
stimulate 
our 
efforts. 
The 
example 
of 
heroes 
must 
always 
be 
set 
before 
a 
people 
in 
order 
to 
ennoble 
its 
mind. 


Such 
is 
the 
moralist's 
point 
of 
view. 
That 
of 
the 
psychologist 
would 
be 
quite 
different. 
While 
a 
society 
has 
no 
right 
to 
be 
tolerant, 
because 
its 
first 
duty 
is 
to 
live, 
the 
psychologist 
may 
remain 
indifferent. 
Considering 
things 
as 
a 
scientist, 
he 
no 
longer 
asks 
their 
utilitarian 
value, 
but 
seeks 
merely 
to 



explain 
them. 


His 
situation 
is 
that 
of 
the 
observer 
before 
any 
phenomenon. 
It 
is 
obviously 
difficult 
to 
read 
in 
cold 
blood 
that 
Carrier 
ordered 
his 
victims 
to 
be 
buried 
up 
to 
the 
neck 
so 
that 
they 
might 
then 
be 
blinded 
and 
subjected 
to 
horrible 
torments. 
Yet 
if 
we 
wish 
to 
comprehend 
such 
acts 
we 
must 
be 
no 
more 
indignant 
than 
the 
naturalist 
before 
the 
spider 
slowly 
devouring 
a 
fly. 
As 
soon 
as 
the 
reason 
is 
moved 
it 
is 
no 
longer 
reason, 
and 
can 
explain 
nothing. 


The 
functions 
of 
the 
historian 
and 
the 
psychologist 
are 
not, 
as 
we 
see, 
identical, 
but 
of 
both 
we 
may 
demand 
the 
endeavour, 
by 
a 
wise 
interpretation 
of 
the 
facts, 
to 
discover, 
under 
the 
visible 
evidences, 
the 
invisible 
forces 
which 
determine 
them. 


CHAPTER 
II 


THE 
PSYCHOLOGICAL 
FOUNDATIONS 
OF 
THE 
ANCIEN 
REGIME 


1. 
The 
Absolute 
Monarchy 
and 
the 
Bases 
of 
the 
Ancien 
Regime. 
Many 
historians 
assure 
us 
that 
the 
Revolution 
was 
directed 
against 
the 
autocracy 
of 
the 
monarchy. 
In 
reality 
the 
kings 
of 
France 
had 
ceased 
to 
be 
absolute 
monarchs 
long 
before 
its 
outbreak. 


Only 
very 
late 
in 
history—not 
until 
the 
reign 
of 
Louis 
XIV.—did 
they 
finally 
obtain 
incontestable 
power. 
All 
the 
preceding 
sovereigns, 
even 
the 
most 
powerful, 
such 
as 
Francis 
I., 
for 
example, 
had 
to 
sustain 
a 
constant 
struggle 
either 
against 
the 
seigneurs, 
or 
the 
clergy, 
or 
the 
parliaments, 
and 
they 
did 
not 
always 
win. 
Francis 
himself 
had 
not 
sufficient 
power 
to 
protect 
his 
most 
intimate 
friends 
against 
the 
Sorbonne 
and 
the 
Parliament. 
His 
friend 
and 
councillor 
Berquin, 
having 
offended 
the 
Sorbonne, 
was 
arrested 
upon 
the 
order 
of 
the 
latter 
body. 
The 
king 
ordered 
his 
release, 
which 
was 
refused. 
He 
was 
obliged 
to 
send 
archers 
to 
remove 
him 
from 
the 
Conciergerie, 
and 
could 
find 
no 
other 
means 
of 
protecting 
him 
than 
that 
of 
keeping 
him 
beside 
him 
in 
the 
Louvre. 
The 
Sorbonne 
by 
no 
means 
considered 
itself 
beaten. 
Profiting 
by 
the 
king's 
absence, 
it 
arrested 
Berquin 
again 
and 
had 
him 
tried 
by 
Parliament. 
Condemned 
at 
ten 
in 
the 
morning, 
he 
was 
burned 
alive 
at 
noon. 


Built 
up 
very 
gradually, 
the 
power 
of 
the 
kings 
of 
France 
was 
not 



absolute 
until 
the 
time 
of 
Louis 
XIV. 
It 
then 
rapidly 
declined, 
and 
it 
would 
be 
truly 
difficult 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
absolutism 
of 
Louis 
XVI. 


This 
pretended 
master 
was 
the 
slave 
of 
his 
court, 
his 
ministers, 
the 
clergy, 
and 
the 
nobles. 
He 
did 
what 
they 
forced 
him 
to 
do 
and 
rarely 
what 
he 
wished. 
Perhaps 
no 
Frenchman 
was 
so 
little 
free 
as 
the 
king. 


The 
great 
power 
of 
the 
monarchy 
resided 
originally 
in 
the 
Divine 
origin 
which 
was 
attributed 
to 
it, 
and 
in 
the 
traditions 
which 
had 
accumulated 
during 
the 
ages. 
These 
formed 
the 
real 
social 
framework 
of 
the 
country. 


The 
true 
cause 
of 
the 
disappearance 
of 
the 
ancien 
regime 
was 
simply 
the 
weakening 
of 
the 
traditions 
which 
served 
as 
its 
foundations. 
When 
after 
repeated 
criticism 
it 
could 
find 
no 
more 
defenders, 
the 
ancien 
regime 
crumbled 
like 
a 
building 
whose 
foundations 
have 
been 
destroyed. 


2. 
The 
Inconveniences 
of 
the 
Ancien 
Regime 
A 
long-established 
system 
of 
government 
will 
always 
finally 
seem 
acceptable 
to 
the 
people 
governed. 
Habit 
masks 
its 
inconveniences, 
which 
appear 
only 
when 
men 
begin 
to 
think. 
Then 
they 
ask 
how 
they 
could 
ever 
have 
supported 
them. 
The 
truly 
unhappy 
man 
is 
the 
man 
who 
believes 
himself 
miserable. 


It 
was 
precisely 
this 
belief 
which 
was 
gaining 
ground 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
writers 
whose 
work 
we 
shall 
presently 
study. 
Then 
the 
imperfections 
of 
the 
ancien 
regime 
stared 
all 
men 
in 
the 
face. 
They 
were 
numerous; 
it 
is 
enough 
to 
mention 
a 
few. 


Despite 
the 
apparent 
authority 
of 
the 
central 
power, 
the 
kingdom, 
formed 
by 
the 
successive 
conquest 
of 
independent 
provinces, 
was 
divided 
into 
territories 
each 
of 
which 
had 
its 
own 
laws 
and 
customs, 
and 
each 
of 
which 
paid 
different 
imposts. 
Internal 
customs-houses 
separated 
them. 
The 
unity 
of 
France 
was 
thus 
somewhat 
artificial. 
It 
represented 
an 
aggregate 
of 
various 
countries 
which 
the 
repeated 
efforts 
of 
the 
kings, 
including 
Louis 
XIV., 
had 
not 
succeeded 
in 
wholly 
unifying. 
The 
most 
useful 
effect 
of 
the 
Revolution 
was 
this 
very 
unification. 


To 
such 
material 
divisions 
were 
added 
social 
divisions 
constituted 
by 
different 
classes—nobles, 
clergy, 
and 
the 
Third 
Estate, 
whose 
rigid 
barriers 
could 
only 
with 
the 
utmost 
difficulty 
be 
crossed. 


Regarding 
the 
division 
of 
the 
classes 
as 
one 
of 
its 
sources 
of 
power, 
the 



ancien 
regime 
had 
rigorously 
maintained 
that 
division. 
This 
became 
the 
principal 
cause 
of 
the 
hatreds 
which 
the 
system 
inspired. 
Much 
of 
the 
violence 
of 
the 
triumphant 
bourgeoisie 
represented 
vengeance 
for 
a 
long 
past 
of 
disdain 
and 
oppression. 
The 
wounds 
of 
self-love 
are 
the 
most 
difficult 
of 
all 
to 
forget. 
The 
Third 
Estate 
had 
suffered 
many 
such 
wounds. 
At 
a 
meeting 
of 
the 
States 
General 
in 
1614, 
at 
which 
its 
representatives 
were 
obliged 
to 
remain 
bareheaded 
on 
their 
knees, 
one 
member 
of 
the 
Third 
Estate 
having 
dared 
to 
say 
that 
the 
three 
orders 
were 
like 
three 
brothers, 
the 
spokesman 
of 
the 
nobles 
replied 
``that 
there 
was 
no 
fraternity 
between 
it 
and 
the 
Third; 
that 
the 
nobles 
did 
not 
wish 
the 
children 
of 
cobblers 
and 
tanners 
to 
call 
them 
their 
brothers.'' 


Despite 
the 
march 
of 
enlightenment 
the 
nobles 
and 
the 
clergy 
obstinately 
preserved 
their 
privileges 
and 
their 
demands, 
no 
longer 
justifiable 
now 
that 
these 
classes 
had 
ceased 
to 
render 
services. 


Kept 
from 
the 
exercise 
of 
public 
functions 
by 
the 
royal 
power, 
which 
distrusted 
them, 
and 
progressively 
replaced 
by 
a 
bourgeoisie 
which 
was 
more 
and 
more 
learned 
and 
capable, 
the 
social 
role 
of 
nobility 
and 
clergy 
was 
only 
an 
empty 
show. 
This 
point 
has 
been 
luminously 
expounded 
by 
Taine:— 


``Since 
the 
nobility, 
having 
lost 
its 
special 
capacity, 
and 
the 
Third 
Estate, 
having 
acquired 
general 
capacity, 
were 
now 
on 
a 
level 
in 
respect 
of 
education 
and 
aptitudes, 
the 
inequality 
which 
divided 
them 
had 
become 
hurtful 
and 
useless. 
Instituted 
by 
custom, 
it 
was 
no 
longer 
ratified 
by 
the 
consciousness, 
and 
the 
Third 
Estate 
was 
with 
reason 
angered 
by 
privileges 
which 
nothing 
justified, 
neither 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
nobles 
nor 
the 
incapacity 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie.'' 


By 
reason 
of 
the 
rigidity 
of 
castes 
established 
by 
a 
long 
past 
we 
cannot 
see 
what 
could 
have 
persuaded 
the 
nobles 
and 
the 
clergy 
to 
renounce 
their 
privileges. 
Certainly 
they 
did 
finally 
abandon 
them 
one 
memorable 
evening, 
when 
events 
forced 
them 
to 
do 
so; 
but 
then 
it 
was 
too 
late, 
and 
the 
Revolution, 
unchained, 
was 
pursuing 
its 
course. 


It 
is 
certain 
that 
modern 
progress 
would 
successively 
have 
established 
all 
that 
the 
Revolution 
effected—the 
equality 
of 
citizens 
before 
the 
law, 
the 
suppression 
of 
the 
privileges 
of 
birth, 
&c. 
Despite 
the 
conservative 
spirit 
of 
the 
Latins, 
these 
things 
would 
have 
been 
won, 
as 
they 
were 
by 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
peoples. 
We 
might 
in 
this 
manner 
have 
been 
saved 
twenty 
years 
of 
warfare 
and 
devastation; 
but 
we 
must 
have 
had 
a 
different 
mental 
constitution, 
and, 
above 
all, 
different 
statesmen. 



The 
profound 
hostility 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie 
against 
the 
classes 
maintained 
above 
it 
by 
tradition 
was 
one 
of 
the 
great 
factors 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
and 
perfectly 
explains 
why, 
after 
its 
triumph, 
the 
first 
class 
despoiled 
the 
vanquished 
of 
their 
wealth. 
They 
behaved 
as 
conquerors—like 
William 
the 
Conqueror, 
who, 
after 
the 
conquest 
of 
England, 
distributed 
the 
soil 
among 
his 
soldiers. 


But 
although 
the 
bourgeoisie 
detested 
the 
nobility 
they 
had 
no 
hatred 
for 
royalty, 
and 
did 
not 
regard 
it 
as 
revocable. 
The 
maladdress 
of 
the 
king 
and 
his 
appeals 
to 
foreign 
powers 
only 
very 
gradually 
made 
him 
unpopular. 


The 
first 
Assembly 
never 
dreamed 
of 
founding 
a 
republic. 
Extremely 
royalist, 
in 
fact, 
it 
thought 
simply 
to 
substitute 
a 
constitutional 
for 
an 
absolute 
monarchy. 
Only 
the 
consciousness 
of 
its 
increasing 
power 
exasperated 
it 
against 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
king; 
but 
it 
dared 
not 
overthrow 
him. 


3. 
Life 
under 
the 
Ancien 
Regime. 
It 
is 
difficult 
to 
form 
a 
very 
clear 
idea 
of 
life 
under 
the 
ancien 
regime, 
and, 
above 
all, 
of 
the 
real 
situation 
of 
the 
peasants. 


The 
writers 
who 
defend 
the 
Revolution 
as 
theologians 
defend 
religious 
dogmas 
draw 
such 
gloomy 
pictures 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
peasants 
under 
the 
ancien 
regime 
that 
we 
ask 
ourselves 
how 
it 
was 
that 
all 
these 
unhappy 
creatures 
had 
not 
died 
of 
hunger 
long 
before. 
A 
good 
example 
of 
this 
style 
of 
writing 
may 
be 
found 
in 
a 
book 
by 
M. 
A. 
Rambaud, 
formerly 
professor 
at 
the 
Sorbonne, 
published 
under 
the 
title 
History 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution. 
One 
notices 
especially 
an 
engraving 
bearing 
the 
legend, 
Poverty 
of 
Peasants 
under 
Louis 
XIV. 
In 
the 
foreground 
a 
man 
is 
fighting 
some 
dogs 
for 
some 
bones, 
which 
for 
that 
matter 
are 
already 
quite 
fleshless. 
Beside 
him 
a 
wretched 
fellow 
is 
twisting 
himself 
and 
compressing 
his 
stomach. 
Farther 
back 
a 
woman 
lying 
on 
the 
ground 
is 
eating 
grass. 
At 
the 
back 
of 
the 
landscape 
figures 
of 
which 
one 
cannot 
say 
whether 
they 
are 
corpses 
or 
persons 
starving 
are 
also 
stretched 
on 
the 
soil. 
As 
an 
example 
of 
the 
administration 
of 
the 
ancien 
regime 
the 
same 
author 
assures 
us 
that 
``a 
place 
in 
the 
police 
cost 
300 
livres 
and 
brought 
in 
400,000.'' 
Such 
figures 
surely 
indicate 
a 
great 
disinterestedness 
on 
the 
part 
of 
those 
who 
sold 
such 
productive 
employment! 
He 
also 
informs 
us 
``that 
it 
cost 
only 
120 
livres 
to 
get 
people 
arrested,'' 
and 
that 
``under 
Louis 
XV. 
more 
than 
150,000 
lettres 
de 
cachet 
were 
distributed.'' 



The 
majority 
of 
books 
dealing 
with 
the 
Revolution 
are 
conceived 
with 
as 
little 
impartiality 
and 
critical 
spirit, 
which 
is 
one 
reason 
why 
this 
period 
is 
really 
so 
little 
known 
to 
us. 


Certainly 
there 
is 
no 
lack 
of 
documents, 
but 
they 
are 
absolutely 
contradictory. 
To 
the 
celebrated 
description 
of 
La 
Bruyere 
we 
may 
oppose 
the 
enthusiastic 
picture 
drawn 
by 
the 
English 
traveller 
Young 
of 
the 
prosperous 
condition 
of 
the 
peasants 
of 
some 
of 
the 
French 
provinces. 


Were 
they 
really 
crushed 
by 
taxation, 
and 
did 
they, 
as 
has 
been 
stated, 
pay 
four-fifths 
of 
their 
revenue 
instead 
of 
a 
fifth 
as 
to-day? 
Impossible 
to 
say 
with 
certainty. 
One 
capital 
fact, 
however, 
seems 
to 
prove 
that 
under 
the 
ancien 
regime 
the 
situation 
of 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
rural 
districts 
could 
not 
have 
been 
so 
very 
wretched, 
since 
it 
seems 
established 
that 
more 
than 
a 
third 
of 
the 
soil 
had 
been 
bought 
by 
peasants. 


We 
are 
better 
informed 
as 
to 
the 
financial 
system. 
It 
was 
very 
oppressive 
and 
extremely 
complicated. 
The 
budgets 
usually 
showed 
deficits, 
and 
the 
imposts 
of 
all 
kinds 
were 
raised 
by 
tyrannical 
farmers-general. 
At 
the 
very 
moment 
of 
the 
Revolution 
this 
condition 
of 
the 
finances 
became 
the 
cause 
of 
universal 
discontent, 
which 
is 
expressed 
in 
the 
cahiers 
of 
the 
States 
General. 
Let 
us 
remark 
that 
these 
cahiers 
did 
not 
represent 
a 
previous 
state 
of 
affairs, 
but 
an 
actual 
condition 
due 
to 
a 
crisis 
of 
poverty 
produced 
by 
the 
bad 
harvest 
of 
1788 
and 
the 
hard 
winter 
of 
1789. 
What 
would 
these 
cahiers 
have 
told 
us 
had 
they 
been 
written 
ten 
years 
earlier? 


Despite 
these 
unfavourable 
circumstances 
the 
cahiers 
contained 
no 
revolutionary 
ideas. 
The 
most 
advanced 
merely 
asked 
that 
taxes 
should 
be 
imposed 
only 
with 
the 
consent 
of 
the 
States 
General 
and 
paid 
by 
all 
alike. 
The 
same 
cahiers 
sometimes 
expressed 
a 
wish 
that 
the 
power 
of 
the 
king 
should 
be 
limited 
by 
a 
Constitution 
defining 
his 
rights 
and 
those 
of 
the 
nation. 
If 
these 
wishes 
had 
been 
granted 
a 
constitutional 
monarchy 
could 
very 
easily 
have 
been 
substituted 
for 
the 
absolute 
monarchy, 
and 
the 
Revolution 
would 
probably 
have 
been 
avoided. 


Unhappily, 
the 
nobility 
and 
the 
clergy 
were 
too 
strong 
and 
Louis 


XVI. 
too 
weak 
for 
such 
a 
solution 
to 
be 
possible. 
Moreover, 
it 
would 
have 
been 
rendered 
extremely 
difficult 
by 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
who 
claimed 
to 
substitute 
themselves 
for 
the 
nobles, 
and 
were 
the 
real 
authors 
of 
the 
Revolution. 
The 
movement 
started 
by 
the 
middle 
classes 
rapidly 
exceeded 
their 
hopes, 
needs, 
and 
aspirations. 
They 
had 
claimed 
equality 
for 
their 
own 
profit, 
but 
the 
people 
also 
demanded 



equality. 
The 
Revolution 
thus 
finally 
became 
the 
popular 
government 
which 
it 
was 
not 
and 
had 
no 
intention 
of 
becoming 
at 
the 
outset. 


4. 
Evolution 
of 
Monarchical 
Feeling 
during 
the 
Revolution. 
Despite 
the 
slow 
evolution 
of 
the 
affective 
elements, 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
during 
the 
Revolution 
the 
sentiments, 
not 
of 
the 
people 
only, 
but 
also 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
Assemblies 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
monarchy, 
underwent 
a 
very 
rapid 
change. 
Between 
the 
moment 
when 
the 
legislators 
of 
the 
first 
Assembly 
surrounded 
Louis 
XVI. 
with 
respect 
and 
the 
moment 
when 
his 
head 
was 
cut 
off 
a 
very 
few 
years 
had 
elapsed. 


These 
changes, 
superficial 
rather 
than 
profound, 
were 
in 
reality 
a 
mere 
transposition 
of 
sentiments 
of 
the 
same 
order. 
The 
love 
which 
the 
men 
of 
this 
period 
professed 
for 
the 
king 
was 
transferred 
to 
the 
new 
Government 
which 
had 
inherited 
his 
power. 
The 
mechanism 
of 
such 
a 
transfer 
may 
easily 
be 
demonstrated. 


Under 
the 
ancien 
regime, 
the 
sovereign, 
holding 
his 
power 
by 
Divine 
right, 
was 
for 
this 
reason 
invested 
with 
a 
kind 
of 
supernatural 
power. 
His 
people 
looked 
up 
to 
him 
from 
every 
corner 
of 
the 
country. 


This 
mystic 
belief 
in 
the 
absolute 
power 
of 
royalty 
was 
shattered 
only 
when 
repeated 
experience 
proved 
that 
the 
power 
attributed 
to 
the 
adored 
being 
was 
fictitious. 
He 
then 
lost 
his 
prestige. 
Now, 
when 
prestige 
is 
lost 
the 
crowd 
will 
not 
forgive 
the 
fallen 
idol 
for 
deluding 
them, 
and 
seek 
anew 
the 
idol 
without 
which 
they 
cannot 
exist. 


From 
the 
outset 
of 
the 
Revolution 
numerous 
facts, 
which 
were 
daily 
repeated, 
revealed 
to 
the 
most 
fervent 
believers 
the 
fact 
that 
royalty 
no 
longer 
possessed 
any 
power, 
and 
that 
there 
were 
other 
powers 
capable, 
not 
only 
of 
contending 
with 
royalty, 
but 
possessed 
of 
superior 
force. 


What, 
for 
instance, 
was 
thought 
of 
the 
royal 
power 
by 
the 
multitudes 
who 
saw 
the 
king 
held 
in 
check 
by 
the 
Assembly, 
and 
incapable, 
in 
the 
heart 
of 
Paris, 
of 
defending 
his 
strongest 
fortress 
against 
the 
attacks 
of 
armed 
bands? 


The 
royal 
weakness 
thus 
being 
obvious, 
the 
power 
of 
the 
Assembly 
was 
increasing. 
Now, 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
crowd 
weakness 
has 
no 
prestige; 
it 
turns 
always 
to 
force. 


In 
the 
Assemblies 
feeling 
was 
very 
fluid, 
but 
did 
not 
evolve 
very 
rapidly, 
for 
which 
reason 
the 
monarchical 
faith 
survived 
the 
taking 
of 
the 
Bastille 
the 



flight 
of 
the 
king, 
and 
his 
understanding 
with 
foreign 
sovereigns. 


The 
royalist 
faith 
was 
still 
so 
powerful 
that 
the 
Parisian 
riots 
and 
the 
events 
which 
led 
to 
the 
execution 
of 
Louis 
XVI. 
were 
not 
enough 
finally 
to 
destroy, 
in 
the 
provinces, 
the 
species 
of 
secular 
piety 
which 
enveloped 
the 
old 
monarchy.[8] 


[8] 
As 
an 
instance 
of 
the 
depth 
of 
this 
hereditary 
love 
of 
the 
people 
for 
its 
kings, 
Michelet 
relates 
the 
following 
fact, 
which 
occurred 
in 
the 
reign 
of 
Louis 
XV.: 
``When 
it 
was 
known 
in 
Paris 
that 
Louis 
XV., 
who 
had 
left 
for 
the 
army, 
was 
detained 
ill 
at 
Metz, 
it 
was 
night. 
People 
got 
up 
and 
ran 
tumultuously 
hither 
and 
thither 
without 
knowing 
where 
they 
were 
going; 
the 
churches 
were 
opened 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
night 
. 
. 
. 
people 
assembled 
at 
every 
cross-road, 
jostling 
and 
questioning 
one 
another 
without 
knowing 
what 
they 
were 
after. 
In 
several 
churches 
the 
priest 
who 
was 
reciting 
the 
prayer 
for 
the 
king's 
health 
was 
stopped 
by 
his 
tears, 
and 
the 
people 
replied 
by 
sobs 
and 
cries. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
courier 
who 
brought 
the 
news 
of 
his 
convalescence 
was 
embraced 
and 
almost 
stifled; 
people 
kissed 
his 
horse, 
and 
led 
him 
in 
triumph. 
. 
. 
. 
Every 
street 
resounded 
with 
a 
cry 
of 
joy: 
`The 
king 
is 
healed.' 
'' 
It 
persisted 
in 
a 
great 
part 
of 
France 
during 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
and 
was 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
royalist 
conspiracies 
and 
insurrections 
in 
various 
departments 
which 
the 
Convention 
had 
such 
trouble 
to 
suppress. 
The 
royalist 
faith 
had 
disappeared 
in 
Paris, 
where 
the 
weakness 
of 
the 
king 
was 
too 
plainly 
visible; 
but 
in 
the 
provinces 
the 
royal 
power, 
representing 
God 
on 
earth, 
still 
retained 
its 
prestige. 


The 
royalist 
sentiments 
of 
the 
people 
must 
have 
been 
deeply 
rooted 
to 
survive 
the 
guillotine. 
The 
royalist 
movements 
persisted, 
indeed, 
during 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
and 
were 
accentuated 
under 
the 
Directory, 
when 
forty-nine 
departments 
sent 
royalist 
deputies 
to 
Paris, 
which 
provoked 
the 
Directory 
to 
the 
coup 
d'etat 
of 
Fructidor. 


This 
monarchical-feeling, 
with 
difficulty 
repressed 
by 
the 
Revolution, 
contributed 
to 
the 
success 
of 
Bonaparte 
when 
he 
came 
to 
occupy 
the 
throne 
of 
the 
ancient 
kings, 
and 
in 
great 
measure 
to 
re-establish 
the 
ancien 
regime. 



CHAPTER 
III 


MENTAL 
ANARCHY 
AT 
THE 
TIME 
OF 
THE 
REVOLUTION 
AND 
THE 
INFLUENCE 
ATTRIBUTED 
TO 
THE 
PHILOSOPHERS 


1. 
Origin 
and 
Propagation 
of 
Revolutionary 
Ideas. 
The 
outward 
life 
of 
men 
in 
every 
age 
is 
moulded 
upon 
an 
inward 
life 
consisting 
of 
a 
framework 
of 
traditions, 
sentiments, 
and 
moral 
influences 
which 
direct 
their 
conduct 
and 
maintain 
certain 
fundamental 
notions 
which 
they 
accept 
without 
discussion. 


Let 
the 
resistance 
of 
this 
social 
framework 
weaken, 
and 
ideas 
which 
could 
have 
had 
no 
force 
before 
will 
germinate 
and 
develop. 
Certain 
theories 
whose 
success 
was 
enormous 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Revolution 
would 
have 
encountered 
an 
impregnable 
wall 
two 
centuries 
earlier. 


The 
aim 
of 
these 
considerations 
is 
to 
recall 
to 
the 
reader 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
outward 
events 
of 
revolutions 
are 
always 
a 
consequence 
of 
invisible 
transformations 
which 
have 
slowly 
gone 
forward 
in 
men's 
minds. 
Any 
profound 
study 
of 
a 
revolution 
necessitates 
a 
study 
of 
the 
mental 
soil 
upon 
which 
the 
ideas 
that 
direct 
its 
course 
have 
to 
germinate. 


Generally 
slow 
in 
the 
extreme, 
the 
evolution 
of 
ideas 
is 
often 
invisible 
for 
a 
whole 
generation. 
Its 
extent 
can 
only 
be 
grasped 
by 
comparing 
the 
mental 
condition 
of 
the 
same 
social 
classes 
at 
the 
two 
extremities 
of 
the 
curve 
which 
the 
mind 
has 
followed. 
To 
realise 
the 
different 
conceptions 
of 
royalty 
entertained 
by 
educated 
men 
under 
Louis 
XIV. 
and 
Louis 
XVI., 
we 
must 
compare 
the 
political 
theories 
of 
Bossuet 
and 
Turgot. 


Bossuet 
expressed 
the 
general 
conceptions 
of 
his 
time 
concerning 
the 
absolute 
monarchy 
when 
he 
based 
the 
authority 
of 
a 
Government 
upon 
the 
will 
of 
God, 
``sole 
judge 
of 
the 
actions 
of 
kings, 
always 
irresponsible 
before 
men.'' 
Religious 
faith 
was 
then 
as 
strong 
as 
the 
monarchical 
faith 
from 
which 
it 
seemed 
inseparable, 
and 
no 
philosopher 
could 
have 
shaken 
it. 


The 
writings 
of 
the 
reforming 
ministers 
of 
Louis 
XVI., 
those 
of 
Turgot, 
for 
instance, 
are 
animated 
by 
quite 
another 
spirit. 
Of 
the 
Divine 
right 
of 
kings 
there 
is 
hardly 
a 
word, 
and 
the 
rights 
of 
the 
peoples 
begin 
to 
be 
clearly 
defined. 


Many 
events 
had 
contributed 
to 
prepare 
for 
such 
an 
evolution— 
unfortunate 
wars, 
famines, 
imposts, 
general 
poverty 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
reign 
of 
Louis 
XV., 
&c. 
Slowly 
destroyed, 
respect 
for 
monarchical 
authority 
was 



replaced 
by 
a 
mental 
revolt 
which 
was 
ready 
to 
manifest 
itself 
as 
soon 
as 
occasion 
should 
arise. 


When 
once 
the 
mental 
framework 
commences 
to 
crumble 
the 
end 
comes 
rapidly. 
This 
is 
why 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Revolution 
ideas 
were 
so 
quickly 
propagated 
which 
were 
by 
no 
means 
new, 
but 
which 
until 
then 
had 
exerted 
no 
influence, 
as 
they 
had 
not 
fallen 
on 
fruitful 
ground. 


Yet 
the 
ideas 
which 
were 
then 
so 
attractive 
and 
effectual 
had 
often 
been 
expressed. 
For 
a 
long 
time 
they 
had 
inspired 
the 
politics 
of 
England. 
Two 
thousand 
years 
earlier 
the 
Greek 
and 
Latin 
authors 
had 
written 
in 
defence 
of 
liberty, 
had 
cursed 
tyrants, 
and 
proclaimed 
the 
rights 
of 
popular 
sovereignty. 


The 
middle 
classes 
who 
effected 
the 
Revolution, 
although, 
like 
their 
fathers, 
they 
had 
learned 
all 
these 
things 
in 
text-books, 
were 
not 
in 
any 
degree 
moved 
by 
them, 
because 
the 
moment 
when 
such 
ideas 
could 
move 
them 
had 
not 
arrived. 
How 
should 
the 
people 
have 
been 
impressed 
by 
them 
at 
a 
time 
when 
all 
men 
were 
accustomed 
to 
regard 
all 
hierarchies 
as 
natural 
necessities? 


The 
actual 
influence 
of 
the 
philosophers 
in 
the 
genesis 
of 
the 
Revolution 
was 
not 
that 
which 
was 
attributed 
to 
them. 
They 
revealed 
nothing 
new, 
but 
they 
developed 
the 
critical 
spirit 
which 
no 
dogma 
can 
resist 
once 
the 
way 
is 
prepared 
for 
its 
downfall. 


Under 
the 
influence 
of 
this 
developing 
critical 
spirit 
things 
which 
were 
no 
longer 
very 
greatly 
respected 
came 
to 
be 
respected 
less 
and 
less. 
When 
tradition 
and 
prestige 
had 
disappeared 
the 
social 
edifice 
suddenly 
fell. 


This 
progressive 
disaggregation 
finally 
descended 
to 
the 
people, 
but 
was 
not 
commenced 
by 
the 
people. 
The 
people 
follows 
examples, 
but 
never 
sets 
them. 


The 
philosophers, 
who 
could 
not 
have 
exerted 
any 
influence 
over 
the 
people, 
did 
exert 
a 
great 
influence 
over 
the 
enlightened 
portion 
of 
the 
nation. 
The 
unemployed 
nobility, 
who 
had 
long 
been 
ousted 
from 
their 
old 
functions, 
and 
who 
were 
consequently 
inclined 
to 
be 
censorious, 
followed 
their 
leadership. 
Incapable 
of 
foresight, 
the 
nobles 
were 
the 
first 
to 
break 
with 
the 
traditions 
that 
were 
their 
only 
raison 
d'etre. 
As 
steeped 
in 
humanitarianism 
and 
rationalism 
as 
the 
bourgeoisie 
of 
to-day, 
they 
continually 
sapped 
their 
own 
privileges 
by 
their 
criticisms. 
As 
to-day, 
the 
most 
ardent 
reformers 
were 
found 
among 
the 
favourites 
of 
fortune. 
The 
aristocracy 
encouraged 
dissertations 
on 
the 
social 
contract, 
the 
rights 
of 
man, 
and 
the 
equality 
of 
citizens. 
At 
the 
theatre 
it 
applauded 
plays 
which 
criticised 
privileges, 
the 



arbitrariness 
and 
the 
incapacity 
of 
men 
in 
high 
places, 
and 
abuses 
of 
all 
kinds. 


As 
soon 
as 
men 
lose 
confidence 
in 
the 
foundations 
of 
the 
mental 
framework 
which 
guides 
their 
conduct 
they 
feel 
at 
first 
uneasy 
and 
then 
discontented. 
All 
classes 
felt 
their 
old 
motives 
of 
action 
gradually 
disappearing. 
Things 
that 
had 
seemed 
sacred 
for 
centuries 
were 
now 
sacred 
no 
longer. 


The 
censorious 
spirit 
of 
the 
nobility 
and 
of 
the 
writers 
of 
the 
day 
would 
not 
have 
sufficed 
to 
move 
the 
heavy 
load 
of 
tradition, 
but 
that 
its 
action 
was 
added 
to 
that 
of 
other 
powerful 
influences. 
We 
have 
already 
stated, 
in 
citing 
Bossuet, 
that 
under 
the 
ancien 
regime 
the 
religious 
and 
civil 
governments, 
widely 
separated 
in 
our 
days, 
were 
intimately 
connected. 
To 
injure 
one 
was 
inevitably 
to 
injure 
the 
other. 
Now, 
even 
before 
the 
monarchical 
idea 
was 
shaken 
the 
force 
of 
religious 
tradition 
was 
greatly 
diminished 
among 
cultivated 
men. 
The 
constant 
progress 
of 
knowledge 
had 
sent 
an 
increasing 
number 
of 
minds 
from 
theology 
to 
science 
by 
opposing 
the 
truth 
observed 
to 
the 
truth 
revealed. 


This 
mental 
evolution, 
although 
as 
yet 
very 
vague, 
was 
sufficient 
to 
show 
that 
the 
traditions 
which 
for 
so 
many 
centuries 
had 
guided 
men 
had 
not 
the 
value 
which 
had 
been 
attributed 
to 
them, 
and 
that 
it 
would 
soon 
be 
necessary 
to 
replace 
them. 


But 
where 
discover 
the 
new 
elements 
which 
might; 
take 
the 
place 
of 
tradition? 
Where 
seek 
the 
magic 
ring 
which 
would 
raise 
a 
new 
social 
edifice 
on 
the 
remains 
of 
that 
which 
no 
longer 
contented 
men? 


Men 
were 
agreed 
in 
attributing 
to 
reason 
the 
power 
that 
tradition 
and 
the 
gods 
seemed 
to 
have 
lost. 
How 
could 
its 
force 
be 
doubted? 
Its 
discoveries 
having 
been 
innumerable, 
was 
it 
not 
legitimate 
to 
suppose 
that 
by 
applying 
it 
to 
the 
construction 
of 
societies 
it 
would 
entirely 
transform 
them? 
Its 
possible 
function 
increased 
very 
rapidly 
in 
the 
thoughts 
of 
the 
more 
enlightened, 
in 
proportion 
as 
tradition 
seemed 
more 
and 
more 
to 
be 
distrusted. 


The 
sovereign 
power 
attributed 
to 
reason 
must 
be 
regarded 
as 
the 
culminating 
idea 
which 
not 
only 
engendered 
the 
Revolution 
but 
governed 
it 
throughout. 
During 
the 
whole 
Revolution 
men 
gave 
themselves 
up 
to 
the 
most 
persevering 
efforts 
to 
break 
with 
the 
past, 
and 
to 
erect 
society 
upon 
a 
new 
plan 
dictated 
by 
logic. 


Slowly 
filtering 
downward, 
the 
rationalistic 
theories 
of 
the 
philosophers 
meant 
to 
the 
people 
simply 
that 
all 
the 
things 
which 
had 
been 
regarded 
as 
worthy 
of 
respect 
were 
now 
no 
longer 
worthy. 



Men 
being 
declared 
equal, 
the 
old 
masters 
need 
no 
longer 
be 
obeyed. 


The 
multitude 
easily 
succeeded 
in 
ceasing 
to 
respect 
what 
the 
upper 
classes 
themselves 
no 
longer 
respected. 
When 
the 
barrier 
of 
respect 
was 
down 
the 
Revolution 
was 
accomplished. 


The 
first 
result 
of 
this 
new 
mentality 
was 
a 
general 
insubordination. 
Mme. 
Vigee 
Lebrun 
relates 
that 
on 
the 
promenade 
at 
Longchamps 
men 
of 
the 
people 
leaped 
on 
the 
footboards 
of 
the 
carriages, 
saying, 
``Next 
year 
you 
will 
be 
behind 
and 
we 
shall 
be 
inside.'' 


The 
populace 
was 
not 
alone 
in 
manifesting 
insubordination 
and 
discontent. 
These 
sentiments 
were 
general 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
the 
Revolution. 
``The 
lesser 
clergy,'' 
says 
Taine, 
``are 
hostile 
to 
the 
prelates; 
the 
provincial 
gentry 
to 
the 
nobility 
of 
the 
court; 
the 
vassals 
to 
the 
seigneurs; 
the 
peasants 
to 
the 
townsmen,'' 
&c. 


This 
state 
of 
mind, 
which 
had 
been 
communicated 
from 
the 
nobles 
and 
clergy 
to 
the 
people, 
also 
invaded 
the 
army. 
At 
the 
moment 
the 
States 
General 
were 
opened 
Necker 
said: 
``We 
are 
not 
sure 
of 
the 
troops.'' 
The 
officers 
were 
becoming 
humanitarian 
and 
philosophical. 
The 
soldiers, 
recruited 
from 
the 
lowest 
class 
of 
the 
population, 
did 
not 
philosophise, 
but 
they 
no 
longer 
obeyed. 


In 
their 
feeble 
minds 
the 
ideas 
of 
equality 
meant 
simply 
the 
suppression 
of 
all 
leaders 
and 
masters, 
and 
therefore 
of 
all 
obedience. 
In 
1790 
more 
than 
twenty 
regiments 
threatened 
their 
officers, 
and 
sometimes, 
as 
at 
Nancy, 
threw 
them 
into 
prison. 


The 
mental 
anarchy 
which, 
after 
spreading 
through 
all 
the 
classes 
of 
society, 
finally 
invaded 
the 
army 
was 
the 
principal 
cause 
of 
the 
disappearance 
of 
the 
ancien 
regime. 
``It 
was 
the 
defection 
of 
the 
army 
affected 
by 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 
Third 
Estate,'' 
wrote 
Rivarol, 
``that 
destroyed 
royalty.'' 


2. 
The 
supposed 
Influence 
of 
the 
Philosophers 
of 
the 
Eighteenth 
Century 
upon 
the 
Genesis 
of 
the 
Revolution—Their 
dislike 
of 
Democracy. 
Although 
the 
philosophers 
who 
have 
been 
supposed 
the 
inspirers 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution 
did 
attack 
certain 
privileges 
and 
abuses, 
we 
must 
not 
for 
that 
reason 
regard 
them 
as 
partisans 
of 
popular 
government. 
Democracy, 
whose 
role 
in 
Greek 
history 
was 
familiar 
to 
them, 
was 
generally 
highly 
antipathetic 
to 
them. 
They 
were 
not 
ignorant 
of 
the 
destruction 
and 
violence 



which 
are 
its 
invariable 
accompaniments, 
and 
knew 
that 
in 
the 
time 
of 
Aristotle 
it 
was 
already 
defined 
as 
``a 
State 
in 
which 
everything, 
even 
the 
law, 
depends 
on 
the 
multitude 
set 
up 
as 
a 
tyrant 
and 
governed 
by 
a 
few 
declamatory 
speakers.'' 


Pierre 
Bayle, 
the 
true 
forerunner 
of 
Voltaire, 
recalled 
in 
the 
following 
terms 
the 
consequences 
of 
popular 
government 
in 
Athens:— 


``If 
one 
considers 
this 
history, 
which 
displays 
at 
great 
length 
the 
tumult 
of 
the 
assemblies, 
the 
factions 
dividing 
the 
city, 
the 
seditious 
disturbing 
it, 
the 
most 
illustrious 
subjects 
persecuted, 
exiled, 
and 
punished 
by 
death 
at 
the 
will 
of 
a 
violent 
windbag, 
one 
would 
conclude 
that 
this 
people, 
which 
so 
prided 
itself 
on 
its 
liberty, 
was 
really 
the 
slave 
of 
a 
small 
number 
of 
caballers, 
whom 
they 
called 
demagogues, 
and 
who 
made 
it 
turn 
now 
in 
this 
direction, 
now 
in 
that, 
as 
their 
passions 
changed, 
almost 
as 
the 
sea 
heaps 
the 
waves 
now 
one 
way, 
now 
another, 
according 
to 
the 
winds 
which 
trouble 
it. 
You 
will 
seek 
in 
vain 
in 
Macedonia, 
which 
was 
a 
monarchy, 
for 
as 
many 
examples 
of 
tyranny 
as 
Athenian 
history 
will 
afford.'' 


Montesquieu 
had 
no 
greater 
admiration 
for 
the 
democracy. 
Having 
described 
the 
three 
forms 
of 
government—republican, 
monarchical, 
and 
despotic—he 
shows 
very 
clearly 
what 
popular 
government 
may 
lead 
to:— 


``Men 
were 
free 
with 
laws; 
men 
would 
fain 
be 
free 
without 
them; 
what 
was 
a 
maxim 
is 
called 
severity; 
what 
was 
order 
is 
called 
hindrance. 
Formerly 
the 
welfare 
of 
individuals 
constituted 
the 
public 
wealth, 
but 
now 
the 
public 
wealth 
becomes 
the 
patrimony 
of 
individuals. 
The 
republic 
is 
spoil, 
and 
its 
strength 
is 
merely 
the 
power 
of 
a 
few 
citizens 
and 
the 
licence 
of 
all.'' 


``. 
. 
. 
Little 
petty 
tyrants 
spring 
up 
who 
have 
all 
the 
vices 
of 
a 
single 
tyrant. 
Very 
soon 
what 
is 
left 
of 
liberty 
becomes 
untenable; 
a 
single 
tyrant 
arises, 
and 
the 
people 
loses 
all, 
even 
the 
advantages 
of 
corruption. 


``Democracy 
has 
therefore 
two 
extremes 
to 
avoid; 
the 
extreme 
of 
the 
spirit 
of 
equality 
leads 
to 
the 
despotism 
of 
a 
single 
person, 
as 
the 
despotism 
of 
a 
single 
person 
leads 
to 
conquest.'' 


The 
ideal 
of 
Montesquieu 
was 
the 
English 
constitutional 
government, 
which 
prevented 
the 
monarchy 
from 
degenerating 
into 
despotism. 
Otherwise 
the 
influence 
of 
this 
philosopher 
at 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
Revolution 
was 
very 
slight. 


As 
for 
the 
Encyclopaedists, 
to 
whom 
such 
a 
considerable 
role 
is 
attributed, 
they 
hardly 
dealt 
with 
politics, 
excepting 
d'Holbach, 
a 
liberal 
monarchist 
like 
Voltaire 
and 
Diderot. 
They 
wrote 
chiefly 
in 
defence 
of 



individual 
liberty, 
opposing 
the 
encroachments 
of 
the 
Church, 
at 
that 
time 
extremely 
intolerant 
and 
inimical 
to 
philosophers. 
Being 
neither 
Socialists 
nor 
democrats, 
the 
Revolution 
could 
not 
utilise 
any 
of 
their 
principles. 


Voltaire 
himself 
was 
by 
no 
means 
a 
partisan 
of 
democracy. 


``Democracy,'' 
he 
said, 
``seems 
only 
to 
suit 
a 
very 
small 
country, 
and 
even 
then 
it 
must 
be 
fortunately 
situated. 
Little 
as 
it 
may 
be, 
it 
will 
make 
many 
mistakes, 
because 
it 
will 
be 
composed 
of 
men. 
Discord 
will 
prevail 
there 
as 
in 
a 
convent 
full 
of 
monks; 
but 
there 
will 
be 
no 
St. 
Bartholomew's 
day, 
no 
Irish 
massacres, 
no 
Sicilian 
Vespers, 
no 
Inquisition, 
no 
condemnation 
to 
the 
galleys 
for 
having 
taken 
water 
from 
the 
sea 
without 
paying 
for 
it; 
unless 
we 
suppose 
this 
republic 
to 
be 
composed 
of 
devils 
in 
a 
corner 
of 
hell.'' 


All 
these 
men 
who 
are 
supposed 
to 
have 
inspired 
the 
Revolution 
had 
opinions 
which 
were 
far 
from 
subversive, 
and 
it 
is 
really 
difficult 
to 
see 
that 
they 
had 
any 
real 
influence 
on 
the 
development 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
movement. 
Rousseau 
was 
one 
of 
the 
very 
few 
democratic 
philosophers 
of 
his 
age, 
which 
is 
why 
his 
Contrat 
Social 
became 
the 
Bible 
of 
the 
men 
of 
the 
Terror. 
It 
seemed 
to 
furnish 
the 
rational 
justification 
necessary 
to 
excuse 
the 
acts 
deriving 
from 
unconscious 
mystic 
and 
affective 
impulses 
which 
no 
philosophy 
had 
inspired. 


To 
be 
quite 
truthful, 
the 
democratic 
instincts 
of 
Rousseau 
were 
by 
no 
means 
above 
suspicion. 
He 
himself 
considered 
that 
his 
projects 
for 
social 
reorganisation, 
based 
upon 
popular 
sovereignty, 
could 
be 
applied 
only 
to 
a 
very 
small 
State; 
and 
when 
the 
Poles 
asked 
him 
for 
a 
draft 
democratic 
Constitution 
he 
advised 
them 
to 
choose 
a 
hereditary 
monarch. 


Among 
the 
theories 
of 
Rousseau 
that 
relating 
to 
the 
perfection 
of 
the 
primitive 
social 
state 
had 
a 
great 
success. 
He 
asserted, 
together 
with 
various 
writers 
of 
his 
time, 
that 
primitive 
mankind 
was 
perfect; 
it 
was 
corrupted 
only 
by 
society. 
By 
modifying 
society 
by 
means 
of 
good 
laws 
one 
might 
bring 
back 
the 
happiness 
of 
the 
early 
world. 
Ignorant 
of 
all 
psychology, 
he 
believed 
that 
men 
were 
the 
same 
throughout 
time 
and 
space 
and 
that 
they 
could 
all 
be 
ruled 
by 
the 
same 
laws 
and 
institutions. 
This 
was 
then 
the 
general 
belief. 
``The 
vices 
and 
virtues 
of 
the 
people,'' 
wrote 
Helvetius, 
``are 
always 
a 
necessary 
effect 
of 
its 
legislation. 
. 
. 
. 
How 
can 
we 
doubt 
that 
virtue 
is 
in 
the 
case 
of 
all 
peoples 
the 
result 
of 
the 
wisdom, 
more 
or 
less 
perfect, 
of 
the 
administration?'' 


There 
could 
be 
no 
greater 
mistake. 



3. 
The 
Philosophical 
Ideas 
of 
the 
Bourgeoisie 
at 
the 
Time 
of 
the 
Revolution. 
It 
is 
by 
no 
means 
easy 
to 
say 
just 
what 
were 
the 
social 
and 
political 
conceptions 
of 
a 
Frenchman 
of 
the 
middle 
classes 
at 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
Revolution. 
They 
might 
be 
reduced 
to 
a 
few 
formulae 
concerning 
fraternity, 
equality, 
and 
popular 
government, 
summed 
up 
in 
the 
celebrated 
Declaration 
of 
the 
Rights 
of 
Man, 
of 
which 
we 
shall 
have 
occasion 
to 
quote 
a 
few 
passages. 


The 
philosophers 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
century 
do 
not 
seem 
to 
have 
been 
very 
highly 
rated 
by 
the 
men 
of 
the 
Revolution. 
Rarely 
are 
they 
quoted 
in 
the 
speeches 
of 
the 
time. 
Hypnotised 
by 
their 
classical 
memories 
of 
Greece 
and 
Rome, 
the 
new 
legislators 
re-read 
their 
Plato 
and 
their 
Plutarch. 
They 
wished 
to 
revive 
the 
constitution 
of 
Sparta, 
with 
its 
manners, 
its 
frugal 
habits, 
and 
its 
laws. 


Lycurgus, 
Solon, 
Miltiades, 
Manlius 
Torquatus, 
Brutus, 
Mucius 
Scaevola, 
even 
the 
fabulous 
Minos 
himself, 
became 
as 
familiar 
in 
the 
tribune 
as 
in 
the 
theatre, 
and 
the 
public 
went 
crazy 
over 
them. 
The 
shades 
of 
the 
heroes 
of 
antiquity 
hovered 
over 
the 
revolutionary 
assemblies. 
Posterity 
alone 
has 
replaced 
them 
by 
the 
shades 
of 
the 
philosophers 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
century. 


We 
shall 
see 
that 
in 
reality 
the 
men 
of 
this 
period, 
generally 
represented 
as 
bold 
innovators 
guided 
by 
subtle 
philosophers, 
professed 
to 
effect 
no 
innovations 
whatever, 
but 
to 
return 
to 
a 
past 
long 
buried 
in 
the 
mists 
of 
history, 
and 
which, 
moreover, 
they 
scarcely 
ever 
in 
the 
least 
understood. 


The 
more 
reasonable, 
who 
did 
not 
go 
so 
far 
back 
for 
their 
models, 
aimed 
merely 
at 
adopting 
the 
English 
constitutional 
system, 
of 
which 
Montesquieu 
and 
Voltaire 
had 
sung 
the 
praises, 
and 
which 
all 
nations 
were 
finally 
to 
imitate 
without 
violent 
crises. 


Their 
ambitions 
were 
confined 
to 
a 
desire 
to 
perfect 
the 
existing 
monarchy, 
not 
to 
overthrow 
it. 
But 
in 
time 
of 
revolution 
men 
often 
take 
a 
very 
different 
path 
from 
that 
they 
propose 
to 
take. 
At 
the 
time 
of 
the 
convocation 
of 
the 
States 
General 
no 
one 
would 
ever 
have 
supposed 
that 
a 
revolution 
of 
peaceful 
bourgeoisie 
and 
men 
of 
letters 
would 
rapidly 
be 
transformed 
into 
one 
of 
the 
most 
sanguinary 
dictatorships 
of 
history. 



CHAPTER 
IV 


PSYCHOLOGICAL 
ILLUSIONS 
RESPECTING 
THE 
FRENCH 
REVOLUTION 


1. 
Illusions 
respecting 
Primitive 
Man, 
the 
Return 
to 
a 
State 
of 
Nature, 
and 
the 
Psychology 
of 
the 
People. 
We 
have 
already 
repeated, 
and 
shall 
again 
repeat, 
that 
the 
errors 
of 
a 
doctrine 
do 
not 
hinder 
its 
propagation, 
so 
that 
all 
we 
have 
to 
consider 
here 
is 
its 
influence 
upon 
men's 
minds. 


But 
although 
the 
criticism 
of 
erroneous 
doctrines 
is 
seldom 
of 
practical 
utility, 
it 
is 
extremely 
interesting 
from 
a 
psychological 
point 
of 
view. 
The 
philosopher 
who 
wishes 
to 
understand 
the 
working 
of 
men's 
minds 
should 
always 
carefully 
consider 
the 
illusions 
which 
they 
live 
with. 
Never, 
perhaps, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
history 
have 
these 
illusions 
appeared 
so 
profound 
and 
so 
numerous 
as 
during 
the 
Revolution. 


One 
of 
the 
most 
prominent 
was 
the 
singular 
conception 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
our 
first 
ancestors 
and 
primitive 
societies. 
Anthropology 
not 
having 
as 
yet 
revealed 
the 
conditions 
of 
our 
remoter 
forbears, 
men 
supposed, 
being 
influenced 
by 
the 
legends 
of 
the 
Bible, 
that 
man 
had 
issued 
perfect 
from 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
Creator. 
The 
first 
societies 
were 
models 
which 
were 
afterwards 
ruined 
by 
civilisation, 
but 
to 
which 
mankind 
must 
return. 
The 
return 
to 
the 
state 
of 
nature 
was 
very 
soon 
the 
general 
cry. 
``The 
fundamental 
principle 
of 
all 
morality, 
of 
which 
I 
have 
treated 
in 
my 
writings,'' 
said 
Rousseau, 
``is 
that 
man 
is 
a 
being 
naturally 
good, 
loving 
justice 
and 
order.'' 


Modern 
science, 
by 
determining, 
from 
the 
surviving 
remnants, 
the 
conditions 
of 
life 
of 
our 
first 
ancestors, 
has 
long 
ago 
shown 
the 
error 
of 
this 
doctrine. 
Primitive 
man 
has 
become 
an 
ignorant 
and 
ferocious 
brute, 
as 
ignorant 
as 
the 
modern 
savage 
of 
goodness, 
morality, 
and 
pity. 
Governed 
only 
by 
his 
instinctive 
impulses, 
he 
throws 
himself 
on 
his 
prey 
when 
hunger 
drives 
him 
from 
his 
cave, 
and 
falls 
upon 
his 
enemy 
the 
moment 
he 
is 
aroused 
by 
hatred. 
Reason, 
not 
being 
born, 
could 
have 
no 
hold 
over 
his 
instincts. 


The 
aim 
of 
civilisation, 
contrary 
to 
all 
revolutionary 
beliefs, 
has 
been 
not 
to 
return 
to 
the 
state 
of 
nature 
but 
to 
escape 
from 
it. 
It 
was 
precisely 
because 
the 
Jacobins 
led 
mankind 
back 
to 
the 
primitive 
condition 
by 
destroying 
all 
the 
social 
restraints 
without 
which 
no 
civilisation 
can 
exist 
that 
they 
transformed 
a 
political 
society 
into 
a 
barbarian 
horde. 


The 
ideas 
of 
these 
theorists 
concerning 
the 
nature 
of 
man 
were 
about 
as 



valuable 
as 
those 
of 
a 
Roman 
general 
concerning 
the 
power 
of 
omens. 
Yet 
their 
influence 
as 
motives 
of 
action 
was 
considerable. 
The 
Convention 
was 
always 
inspired 
by 
such 
ideas. 


The 
errors 
concerning 
our 
primitive 
ancestors 
were 
excusable 
enough, 
since 
before 
modern 
discoveries 
had 
shown 
us 
the 
real 
conditions 
of 
their 
existence 
these 
were 
absolutely 
unknown. 
But 
the 
absolute 
ignorance 
of 
human 
psychology 
displayed 
by 
the 
men 
of 
the 
Revolution 
is 
far 
less 
easy 
to 
understand. 


It 
would 
really 
seem 
as 
though 
the 
philosophers 
and 
writers 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
century 
must 
have 
been 
totally 
deficient 
in 
the 
smallest 
faculty 
of 
observation. 
They 
lived 
amidst 
their 
contemporaries 
without 
seeing 
them 
and 
without 
understanding 
them. 
Above 
all, 
they 
had 
not 
a 
suspicion 
of 
the 
true 
nature 
of 
the 
popular 
mind. 
The 
man 
of 
the 
people 
always 
appeared 
to 
them 
in 
the 
likeness 
of 
the 
chimerical 
model 
created 
by 
their 
dreams. 
As 
ignorant 
of 
psychology 
as 
of 
the 
teachings 
of 
history, 
they 
considered 
the 
plebeian 
man 
as 
naturally 
good, 
affectionate, 
grateful, 
and 
always 
ready 
to 
listen 
to 
reason. 


The 
speeches 
delivered 
by 
members 
of 
the 
Assembly 
show 
how 
profound 
were 
these 
illusions. 
When 
the 
peasants 
began 
to 
burn 
the 
chateaux 
they 
were 
greatly 
astonished, 
and 
addressed 
them 
in 
sentimental 
harangues, 
praying 
them 
to 
cease, 
in 
order 
not 
to 
``give 
pain 
to 
their 
good 
king,'' 
and 
adjured 
them 
``to 
surprise 
him 
by 
their 
virtues.'' 


2. 
Illusions 
respecting 
the 
Possibility 
of 
separating 
Man 
from 
his 
Past 
and 
the 
Power 
of 
Transformation 
attributed 
to 
the 
Law. 
One 
of 
the 
principles 
which 
served 
as 
a 
foundation 
for 
the 
revolutionary 
institutions 
was 
that 
man 
may 
readily 
be 
cut 
off 
from 
his 
past, 
and 
that 
a 
society 
may 
be 
re-made 
in 
all 
its 
parts 
by 
means 
of 
institutions. 
Persuaded 
in 
the 
light 
of 
reason 
that, 
except 
for 
the 
primitive 
ages 
which 
were 
to 
serve 
as 
models, 
the 
past 
represented 
an 
inheritance 
of 
errors 
and 
superstitions, 
the 
legislators 
of 
the 
day 
resolved 
to 
break 
entirely 
with 
that 
past. 


The 
better 
to 
emphasise 
their 
intention, 
they 
founded 
a 
new 
era, 
transformed 
the 
calendar, 
and 
changed 
the 
names 
of 
the 
months 
and 
seasons. 


Supposing 
all 
men 
to 
be 
alike, 
they 
thought 
they 
could 
legislate 
for 
the 
human 
race. 
Condorcet 
imagined 
that 
he 
was 
expressing 
an 
evident 
truth 



when 
he 
said: 
``A 
good 
law 
must 
be 
good 
for 
all 
men, 
just 
as 
a 
geometrical 
proposition 
is 
true 
for 
all.'' 


The 
theorists 
of 
the 
Revolution 
never 
perceived, 
behind 
the 
world 
of 
visible 
things, 
the 
secret 
springs 
which 
moved 
them. 
A 
century 
of 
biological 
progress 
was 
needed 
to 
show 
how 
grievous 
were 
their 
mistakes, 
and 
how 
wholly 
a 
being 
of 
whatever 
species 
depends 
on 
its 
past. 


With 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
past, 
the 
reformers 
of 
the 
Revolution 
were 
always 
clashing, 
without 
ever 
understanding 
it. 
They 
wanted 
to 
annihilate 
it, 
but 
were 
annihilated 
by 
it 
instead. 


The 
faith 
of 
law-makers 
in 
the 
absolute 
power 
of 
laws 
and 
institutions, 
rudely 
shaken 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
was 
absolute 
at 
its 
outbreak. 
Gregoire 
said 
from 
the 
tribune 
of 
the 
Constituent 
Assembly, 
without 
provoking 
the 
least 
astonishment: 
``We 
could 
if 
we 
would 
change 
religion, 
but 
we 
do 
not 
want 
to.'' 
We 
know 
that 
they 
did 
want 
to 
later, 
and 
we 
know 
how 
miserably 
their 
attempt 
failed. 


Yet 
the 
Jacobins 
had 
in 
their 
hands 
all 
the 
elements 
of 
success. 
Thanks 
to 
the 
completest 
of 
tyrannies, 
all 
obstacles 
were 
removed, 
and 
the 
laws 
which 
it 
pleased 
them 
to 
impose 
were 
always 
accepted. 
After 
ten 
years 
of 
violence, 
of 
destruction 
and 
burning 
and 
pillage 
and 
massacre 
and 
general 
upheaval, 
their 
impotence 
was 
revealed 
so 
startlingly 
that 
they 
fell 
into 
universal 
reprobation. 
The 
dictator 
then 
invoked 
by 
the 
whole 
of 
France 
was 
obliged 
to 
re-establish 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
that 
which 
had 
been 
destroyed. 


The 
attempt 
of 
the 
Jacobins 
to 
re-fashion 
society 
in 
the 
name 
of 
pure 
reason 
constitutes 
an 
experiment 
of 
the 
highest 
interest. 
Probably 
mankind 
will 
never 
have 
occasion 
to 
repeat 
it 
on 
so 
vast 
a 
scale. 


Although 
the 
lesson 
was 
a 
terrible 
one, 
it 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
have 
been 
sufficient 
for 
a 
considerable 
class 
of 
minds, 
since 
even 
in 
our 
days 
we 
hear 
Socialists 
propose 
to 
rebuild 
society 
from 
top 
to 
bottom 
according 
to 
their 
chimerical 
plans. 


3. 
Illusions 
respecting 
the 
Theoretical 
Value 
of 
the 
great 
Revolutionary 
Principles. 
The 
fundamental 
principles 
on 
which 
the 
Revolution 
was 
based 
in 
order 
to 
create 
a 
new 
dispensation 
are 
contained 
in 
the 
Declarations 
of 
Rights 
which 
were 
formulated 
successively 
in 
1789, 
1793, 
and 
1795. 
All 
three 
Declarations 
agree 
in 
proclaiming 
that 
``the 
principle 
of 
sovereignty 
resides 



in 
the 
nation.'' 


For 
the 
rest, 
the 
three 
Declarations 
differ 
on 
several 
points, 
notably 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
equality. 
That 
of 
1789 
simply 
states 
(Article 
1): 
``Men 
are 
born 
and 
remain 
free 
and 
having 
equal 
rights.'' 
That 
of 
1793 
goes 
farther, 
and 
assures 
us 
(Article 
3): 


``All 
men 
are 
equal 
by 
nature.'' 
That 
of 
1795 
is 
more 
modest 
and 
says 
(Article 
3): 
``Equality 
consists 
in 
the 
law 
being 
the 
same 
for 
all.'' 
Besides 
this, 
having 
mentioned 
rights, 
the 
third 
Declaration 
considers 
it 
useful 
to 
speak 
of 
duties. 
Its 
morality 
is 
simply 
that 
of 
the 
Gospel. 
Article 
2 
says: 
``All 
the 
duties 
of 
a 
man 
and 
a 
citizen 
derive 
from 
these 
two 
principles 
engraved 
on 
all 
hearts 
by 
nature: 
do 
not 
do 
unto 
others 
that 
which 
you 
would 
not 
they 
should 
do 
unto 
you; 
do 
constantly 
unto 
others 
the 
good 
you 
would 
wish 
to 
receive 
from 
them.'' 


The 
essential 
portions 
of 
these 
proclamations, 
the 
only 
portions 
which 
have 
really 
survived, 
were 
those 
relating 
to 
equality 
and 
popular 
sovereignty. 


Despite 
the 
weakness 
of 
its 
rational 
meaning, 
the 
part 
played 
by 
the 
Republican 
device, 
Liberty, 
Equality, 
Fraternity, 
was 
considerable. 


This 
magic 
formula, 
which 
is 
still 
left 
engraven 
on 
many 
of 
our 
walls 
until 
it 
shall 
be 
engraven 
on 
our 
hearts, 
has 
really 
possessed 
the 
supernatural 
power 
attributed 
to 
certain 
words 
by 
the 
old 
sorcerers. 


Thanks 
to 
the 
new 
hopes 
excited 
by 
its 
promises, 
its 
power 
of 
expansion 
was 
considerable. 
Thousands 
of 
men 
lost 
their 
lives 
for 
it. 
Even 
in 
our 
days, 
when 
a 
revolution 
breaks 
out 
in 
any 
part 
of 
the 
world, 
the 
same 
formula 
is 
always 
invoked. 


Its 
choice 
was 
happy 
in 
the 
extreme. 
It 
belongs 
to 
the 
category 
of 
indefinite 
dream-evoking 
sentences, 
which 
every 
one 
is 
free 
to 
interpret 
according 
to 
his 
own 
desires, 
hatreds, 
and 
hopes. 
In 
matters 
of 
faith 
the 
real 
sense 
of 
words 
matters 
very 
little; 
it 
is 
the 
meaning 
attached 
to 
them 
that 
makes 
their 
importance. 


Of 
the 
three 
principles 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
device, 
equality 
was 
most 
fruitful 
of 
consequences. 
We 
shall 
see 
in 
another 
part 
of 
this 
book 
that 
it 
is 
almost 
the 
only 
one 
which 
still 
survives, 
and 
is 
still 
productive 
of 
effects. 


It 
was 
certainly 
not 
the 
Revolution 
that 
introduced 
the 
idea 
of 
equality 
into 
the 
world. 
Without 
going 
back 
even 
to 
the 
Greek 
republics, 
we 
may 
remark 
that 
the 
theory 
of 
equality 
was 
taught 
in 
the 
clearest 
fashion 
by 
Christianity 
and 
Islamism. 
All 
men, 
subjects 
of 
the 
one 
God, 
were 
equal 
before 
Him, 
and 
judged 
solely 
according 
to 
their 
merits. 
The 
dogma 
of 
the 



equality 
of 
souls 
before 
God 
was 
an 
essential 
dogma 
with 
Mohammedans 
as 
well 
as 
with 
Christians. 


But 
to 
proclaim 
a 
principle 
is 
not 
enough 
to 
secure 
its 
observation. 
The 
Christian 
Church 
soon 
renounced 
its 
theoretical 
equality, 
and 
the 
men 
of 
the 
Revolution 
only 
remembered 
it 
in 
their 
speeches. 


The 
sense 
of 
the 
term 
``equality'' 
varies 
according 
to 
the 
persons 
using 
it. 
It 
often 
conceals 
sentiments 
very 
contrary 
to 
its 
real 
sense, 
and 
then 
represents 
the 
imperious 
need 
of 
having 
no 
one 
above 
one, 
joined 
to 
the 
no 
less 
lively 
desire 
to 
feel 
above 
others. 
With 
the 
Jacobins 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
as 
with 
those 
of 
our 
days, 
the 
word 
``equality'' 
simply 
involves 
a 
jealous 
hatred 
of 
all 
superiority. 
To 
efface 
superiority, 
such 
men 
pretend 
to 
unify 
manners, 
customs, 
and 
situations. 
All 
despotisms 
but 
that 
exercised 
by 
themselves 
seem 
odious. 


Not 
being 
able 
to 
avoid 
the 
natural 
inequalities, 
they 
deny 
them. 


The 
second 
Declaration 
of 
Rights, 
that 
of 
1793, 
affirms, 
contrary 
to 
the 
evidence, 
that 
``all 
men 
are 
equal 
by 
nature.'' 


It 
would 
seem 
that 
in 
many 
of 
the 
men 
of 
the 
Revolution 
the 
ardent 
desire 
for 
equality 
merely 
concealed 
an 
intense 
need 
of 
inequalities. 
Napoleon 
was 
obliged 
to 
re-establish 
titles 
of 
nobility 
and 
decorations 
for 
their 
benefit. 
Having 
shown 
that 
it 
was 
among 
the 
most 
rabid 
revolutionists 
that 
he 
found 
the 
most 
docile 
instruments 
of 
domination, 
Taine 
continues:— 


``Suddenly, 
through 
all 
their 
preaching 
of 
liberty 
and 
equality, 
appeared 
their 
authoritative 
instincts, 
their 
need 
of 
commanding, 
even 
as 
subordinates, 
and 
also, 
in 
most 
cases, 
an 
appetite 
for 
money 
or 
for 
pleasure. 
Between 
the 
delegate 
of 
the 
Committee 
of 
Public 
Safety 
and 
the 
minister, 
prefect, 
or 
subprefect 
of 
the 
Empire 
the 
difference 
is 
small: 
it 
is 
the 
same 
man 
under 
the 
two 
costumes, 
first 
en 
carmagnole, 
then 
in 
the 
braided 
coat.'' 


The 
dogma 
of 
equality 
had 
as 
its 
first 
consequence 
the 
proclamation 
of 
popular 
sovereignty 
by 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
This 
sovereignty 
remained 
otherwise 
highly 
theoretical 
during 
the 
whole 
Revolution. 


The 
principle 
of 
authority 
was 
the 
lasting 
legacy 
of 
the 
Revolution. 
The 
two 
terms 
``liberty'' 
and 
``fraternity'' 
which 
accompany 
it 
in 
the 
republican 
device 
had 
never 
much 
influence. 
We 
may 
even 
say 
that 
they 
had 
none 
during 
the 
Revolution 
and 
the 
Empire, 
but 
merely 
served 
to 
decorate 
men's 
speeches. 


Their 
influence 
was 
hardly 
more 
considerable 
later. 
Fraternity 
was 
never 
practised 
and 
the 
peoples 
have 
never 
cared 
much 
for 
liberty. 
To-day 
our 



working-men 
have 
completely 
surrendered 
it 
to 
their 
unions. 


To 
sum 
up: 
although 
the 
Republican 
motto 
has 
been 
little 
applied 
it 
has 
exerted 
a 
very 
great 
influence. 
Of 
the 
French 
Revolution 
practically 
nothing 
has 
remained 
in 
the 
popular 
mind 
but 
the 
three 
celebrated 
words 
which 
sum 
up 
its 
gospel, 
and 
which 
its 
armies 
spread 
over 
Europe. 


BOOK 
II 


THE 
RATIONAL, 
AFFECTIVE, 
MYSTIC, 
AND 
COLLECTIVE 
INFLUENCES 
ACTIVE 
DURING 
THE 
REVOLUTION 


CHAPTER 
I 


THE 
PSYCHOLOGY 
OF 
THE 
CONSTITUENT 
ASSEMBLY 


1. 
Psychological 
Influences 
active 
during 
the 
French 
Revolution. 
The 
genesis 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution, 
as 
well 
as 
its 
duration, 
was 
conditioned 
by 
elements 
of 
a 
rational, 
affective, 
mystic, 
and 
collective 
nature, 
each 
category 
of 
which 
was 
ruled 
by 
a 
different 
logic. 
It 
is, 
as 
I 
have 
said, 
because 
they 
have 
not 
been 
able 
to 
dissociate 
the 
respective 
influences 
of 
these 
factors 
that 
so 
many 
historians 
have 
interpreted 
this 
period 
so 
indifferently 


The 
rational 
element 
usually 
invoked 
as 
an 
explanation 
exerted 
in 
reality 
but 
a 
very 
slight 
influence. 
It 
prepared 
the 
way 
for 
the 
Revolution, 
but 
maintained 
it 
only 
at 
the 
outset, 
while 
it 
was 
still 
exclusively 
middle-class. 
Its 
action 
was 
manifested 
by 
many 
measures 
of 
the 
time, 
such 
as 
the 
proposals 
to 
reform 
the 
taxes, 
the 
suppression 
of 
the 
privileges 
of 
a 
useless 
nobility, 
&c. 


As 
soon 
as 
the 
Revolution 
reached 
the 
people, 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
rational 
elements 
speedily 
vanished 
before 
that 
of 
the 
affective 
and 
collective 
elements. 
As 
for 
the 
mystic 
elements, 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
faith, 
they 
made 
the 
army 
fanatical 
and 
propagated 
the 
new 
belief 
throughout 
the 
world. 


We 
shall 
see 
these 
various 
elements 
as 
they 
appeared 
in 
events 
and 
in 
the 
psychology 
of 
individuals. 
Perhaps 
the 
most 
important 
was 
the 
mystic 
element. 
The 
Revolution 
cannot 
be 
clearly 
comprehended—we 
cannot 
repeat 
it 
too 
often—unless 
it 
is 
considered 
as 
the 
formation 
of 
a 
religious 
belief. 



What 
I 
have 
said 
elsewhere 
of 
all 
beliefs 
applies 
equally 
to 
the 
Revolution. 
Referring, 
for 
instance, 
to 
the 
chapter 
on 
the 
Reformation, 
the 
reader 
will 
see 
that 
it 
presents 
more 
than 
one 
analogy 
with 
the 
Revolution. 


Having 
wasted 
so 
much 
time 
in 
demonstrating 
the 
slight 
rational 
value 
of 
beliefs, 
the 
philosophers 
are 
to-day 
beginning 
to 
understand 
their 
function 
better. 
They 
have 
been 
forced 
to 
admit 
that 
these 
are 
the 
only 
factors 
which 
possess 
an 
influence 
sufficient 
to 
transform 
all 
the 
elements 
of 
a 
civilisation. 


They 
impose 
themselves 
on 
men 
apart 
from 
reason 
and 
have 
the 
power 
to 
polarise 
men's 
thoughts 
and 
feelings 
in 
one 
direction. 
Pure 
reason 
had 
never 
such 
a 
power, 
for 
men 
were 
never 
impassioned 
by 
reason. 


The 
religious 
form 
rapidly 
assumed 
by 
the 
Revolution 
explains 
its 
power 
of 
expansion 
and 
the 
prestige 
which 
it 
possessed 
and 
has 
retained. 


Few 
historians 
have 
understood 
that 
this 
great 
monument 
ought 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
the 
foundation 
of 
a 
new 
religion. 
The 
penetrating 
mind 
of 
Tocqueville, 
I 
believe, 
was 
the 
first 
to 
perceive 
as 
much. 


``The 
French 
Revolution,'' 
he 
wrote, 
``was 
a 
political 
revolution 
which 
operated 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
and 
assumed 
something 
of 
the 
aspect 
of 
a 
religious 
revolution. 
See 
by 
what 
regular 
and 
characteristic 
traits 
it 
finally 
resembled 
the 
latter: 
not 
only 
did 
it 
spread 
itself 
far 
and 
wide 
like 
a 
religious 
revolution, 
but, 
like 
the 
latter, 
it 
spread 
itself 
by 
means 
of 
preaching 
and 
propaganda. 
A 
political 
revolution 
which 
inspires 
proselytes, 
which 
is 
preached 
as 
passionately 
to 
foreigners 
as 
it 
is 
accomplished 
at 
home: 
consider 
what 
a 
novel 
spectacle 
was 
this.'' 


The 
religious 
side 
of 
the 
Revolution 
being 
granted, 
the 
accompanying 
fury 
and 
devastation 
are 
easily 
explained. 
History 
shows 
us 
that 
such 
are 
always 
the 
accompaniments 
of 
the 
birth 
of 
religions. 
The 
Revolution 
was 
therefore 
certain 
to 
provoke 
the 
violence 
and 
intolerance 
the 
triumphant 
deities 
demand 
from 
their 
adepts. 
It 
overturned 
all 
Europe 
for 
twenty 
years, 
ruined 
France, 
caused 
the 
death 
of 
millions 
of 
men, 
and 
cost 
the 
country 
several 
invasions: 
but 
it 
is 
as 
a 
rule 
only 
at 
the 
cost 
of 
such 
catastrophes 
that 
a 
people 
can 
change 
its 
beliefs. 


Although 
the 
mystic 
element 
is 
always 
the 
foundation 
of 
beliefs, 
certain 
affective 
and 
rational 
elements 
are 
quickly 
added 
thereto. 
A 
belief 
thus 
serves 
to 
group 
sentiments 
and 
passions 
and 
interests 
which 
belong 
to 
the 
affective 
domain. 
Reason 
then 
envelops 
the 
whole, 
seeking 
to 
justify 
events 
in 
which, 
however, 
it 
played 
no 
part 
whatever. 


At 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
Revolution 
every 
one, 
according 
to 
his 
aspirations, 



dressed 
the 
new 
belief 
in 
a 
different 
rational 
vesture. 
The 
peoples 
saw 
in 
it 
only 
the 
suppression 
of 
the 
religious 
and 
political 
despotisms 
and 
hierarchies 
under 
which 
they 
had 
so 
often 
suffered. 
Writers 
like 
Goethe 
and 
thinkers 
like 
Kant 
imagined 
that 
they 
saw 
in 
it 
the 
triumph 
of 
reason. 
Foreigners 
like 
Humboldt 
came 
to 
France 
``to 
breathe 
the 
air 
of 
liberty 
and 
to 
assist 
at 
the 
obsequies 
of 
despotism.'' 


These 
intellectual 
illusions 
did 
not 
last 
long. 
The 
evolution 
of 
the 
drama 
soon 
revealed 
the 
true 
foundations 
of 
the 
dream. 


2. 
Dissolution 
of 
the 
Ancien 
Regime. 
The 
assembling 
of 
the 
States 
General. 
Before 
they 
are 
realised 
in 
action, 
revolutions 
are 
sketched 
out 
in 
men's 
thoughts. 
Prepared 
by 
the 
causes 
already 
studied, 
the 
French 
Revolution 
commenced 
in 
reality 
with 
the 
reign 
of 
Louis 
XVI. 
More 
discontented 
and 
censorious 
every 
day, 
the 
middle 
classes 
added 
claim 
to 
claim. 
Everybody 
was 
calling 
for 
reform. 


Louis 
XVI. 
thoroughly 
understood 
the 
utility 
of 
reform, 
but 
he 
was 
too 
weak 
to 
impose 
it 
on 
the 
clergy 
and 
the 
nobility. 
He 
could 
not 
even 
retain 
his 
reforming 
ministers, 
Malesherbes 
and 
Turgot. 
What 
with 
famines 
and 
increased 
taxation, 
the 
poverty 
of 
all 
classes 
increased, 
and 
the 
huge 
pensions 
drawn 
by 
the 
Court 
formed 
a 
shocking 
contrast 
to 
the 
general 
distress. 


The 
notables 
convoked 
to 
attempt 
to 
remedy 
the 
financial 
situation 
refused 
a 
system 
of 
equal 
taxation, 
and 
granted 
only 
insignificant 
reforms 
which 
the 
Parliament 
did 
not 
even 
consent 
to 
register. 
It 
had 
to 
be 
dissolved. 
The 
provincial 
Parliaments 
made 
common 
cause 
with 
that 
of 
Paris, 
and 
were 
also 
dissolved. 
But 
they 
led 
opinion, 
and 
in 
all 
parts 
of 
France 
promoted 
the 
demand 
for 
a 
meeting 
of 
the 
States 
General, 
which 
had 
not 
been 
convoked 
for 
nearly 
two 
hundred 
years. 


The 
decision 
was 
taken: 
5,000,000 
Frenchmen, 
of 
whom 
100,000 
were 
ecclesiastics 
and 
150,000 
nobles, 
sent 
their 
representatives. 
There 
were 
in 
all 
1,200 
deputies, 
of 
whom 
578 
were 
of 
the 
Third 
Estate, 
consisting 
chiefly 
of 
magistrates, 
advocates, 
and 
physicians. 
Of 
the 
300 
deputies 
of 
the 
clergy, 
200, 
of 
plebeian 
origin, 
threw 
in 
their 
lot 
with 
the 
Third 
Estate 
against 
the 
nobility 
and 
clergy. 


From 
the 
first 
sessions 
a 
psychological 
conflict 
broke 
out 
between 
the 



deputies 
of 
different 
social 
conditions 
and 
(therefore) 
different 
mentalities. 
The 
magnificent 
costumes 
of 
the 
privileged 
deputies 
contrasted 
in 
a 
humiliating 
fashion 
with 
the 
sombre 
fashions 
of 
the 
Third 
Estate. 


At 
the 
first 
session 
the 
members 
of 
the 
nobility 
and 
the 
clergy 
were 
covered, 
according 
to 
the 
prerogatives 
of 
their 
class, 
before 
the 
king. 
Those 
of 
the 
Third 
Estate 
wished 
to 
imitate 
them, 
but 
the 
privileged 
members 
protested. 
On 
the 
following 
day 
more 
protests 
of 
wounded 
self-love 
were 
heard. 
The 
deputies 
of 
the 
Third 
Estate 
invited 
those 
of 
the 
nobility 
and 
the 
clergy 
who 
were 
sitting 
in 
separate 
halls 
to 
join 
them 
for 
the 
verification 
of 
their 
powers. 
The 
nobles 
refused. 
The 
negotiations 
lasted 
more 
than 
a 
month. 
Finally, 
the 
deputies 
of 
the 
Third 
Estate, 
on 
the 
proposition 
of 
the 
Abbe 
Sieyes, 
considering 
that 
they 
represented 
95 
per 
cent. 
of 
the 
nation, 
declared 
themselves 
constituted 
as 
a 
National 
Assembly. 
From 
that 
moment 
the 
Revolution 
pursued 
its 
course. 


3. 
The 
Constituent 
Assembly. 
The 
power 
of 
a 
political 
assembly 
resides, 
above 
all, 
in 
the 
weakness 
of 
its 
adversaries. 
Astonished 
by 
the 
slight 
resistance 
encountered, 
and 
carried 
away 
by 
the 
ascendancy 
of 
a 
handful 
of 
orators, 
the 
Constituent 
Assembly, 
from 
its 
earliest 
sessions, 
spoke 
and 
acted 
as 
a 
sovereign 
body. 
Notably 
it 
arrogated 
to 
itself 
the 
power 
of 
decreeing 
imposts, 
a 
serious 
encroachment 
upon 
the 
prerogatives 
of 
the 
royal 
power. 


The 
resistance 
of 
Louis 
XVI. 
was 
feeble 
enough. 
He 
simply 
had 
the 
hall 
in 
which 
the 
States 
assembled 
closed. 
The 
deputies 
then 
met 
in 
the 
hall 
of 
the 
tennis-court, 
and 
took 
the 
oath 
that 
they 
would 
not 
separate 
until 
the 
Constitution 
of 
the 
kingdom 
was 
an 
established 
fact. 


The 
majority 
of 
the 
deputies 
of 
the 
clergy 
went 
with 
them. 
The 
king 
revoked 
the 
decision 
of 
the 
Assembly, 
and 
ordered 
the 
deputies 
to 
retire. 
The 
Marquis 
de 
Dreux-Breze, 
the 
Grand 
Master 
of 
Ceremonies, 
having 
invited 
them 
to 
obey 
the 
order 
of 
the 
sovereign, 
the 
President 
of 
the 
Assembly 
declared 
``that 
the 
nation 
assembled 
cannot 
receive 
orders,'' 
and 
Mirabeau 
replied 
to 
the 
envoy 
of 
the 
sovereign 
that, 
being 
united 
by 
the 
will 
of 
the 
people, 
the 
Assembly 
would 
only 
withdraw 
at 
the 
point 
of 
the 
bayonet. 
Again 
the 
king 
gave 
way. 


On 
the 
9th 
of 
June 
the 
meeting 
of 
deputies 
took 
the 
title 
of 
the 



Constituent 
Assembly. 
For 
the 
first 
time 
in 
centuries 
the 
king 
was 
forced 
to 
recognise 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
new 
power, 
formerly 
ignored—that 
of 
the 
people, 
represented 
by 
its 
elected 
representatives. 
The 
absolute 
monarchy 
was 
no 
more. 


Feeling 
himself 
more 
and 
more 
seriously 
threatened, 
Louis 
XVI. 
summoned 
to 
Versailles 
a 
number 
of 
regiments 
composed 
of 
foreign 
mercenaries. 
The 
Assembly 
demanded 
the 
withdrawal 
of 
the 
troops. 


The 
king 
refused, 
and 
dismissed 
Necker, 
replacing 
him 
by 
the 
Marshal 
de 
Broglie, 
reputed 
to 
be 
an 
extremely 
authoritative 
person. 


But 
the 
Assembly 
had 
able 
supporters. 
Camille 
Desmoulins 
and 
others 
harangued 
the 
crowd 
in 
all 
directions, 
calling 
it 
to 
the 
defence 
of 
liberty. 
They 
sounded 
the 
tocsin, 
organised 
a 
militia 
of 
12,000 
men, 
took 
muskets 
and 
cannon 
from 
the 
Invalides, 
and 
on 
the 
14th 
of 
July 
the 
armed 
bands 
marched 
upon 
the 
Bastille. 
The 
fortress, 
barely 
defended, 
capitulated 
in 
a 
few 
hours. 
Seven 
prisoners 
were 
found 
within 
it, 
of 
whom 
one 
was 
an 
idiot 
and 
four 
were 
accused 
of 
forgery. 


The 
Bastille, 
the 
prison 
of 
many 
victims 
of 
arbitrary 
power, 
symbolised 
the 
royal 
power 
to 
many 
minds; 
but 
the 
people 
who 
demolished 
it 
had 
not 
suffered 
by 
it. 
Scarcely 
any 
but 
members 
of 
the 
nobility 
were 
imprisoned 
there. 


The 
influence 
exercised 
by 
the 
taking 
of 
this 
fortress 
has 
continued 
to 
our 
days. 
Serious 
historians 
like 
M. 
Rambaud 
assure 
us 
that 
``the 
taking 
of 
the 
Bastille 
is 
a 
culminating 
fact 
in 
the 
history, 
not 
of 
France 
only 
but 
of 
all 
Europe, 
and 
inaugurates 
a 
new 
epoch 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
world.'' 


Such 
credulity 
is 
a 
little 
excessive. 
The 
importance 
of 
the 
event 
lay 
simply 
in 
the 
psychological 
fact 
that 
for 
the 
first 
time 
the 
people 
received 
an 
obvious 
proof 
of 
the 
weakness 
of 
an 
authority 
which 
had 
lately 
been 
formidable. 


When 
the 
principle 
of 
authority 
is 
injured 
in 
the 
public 
mind 
it 
dissolves 
very 
rapidly. 
What 
might 
not 
one 
demand 
of 
a 
king 
who 
could 
not 
defend 
his 
principal 
fortress 
against 
popular 
attacks? 
The 
master 
regarded 
as 
all-
powerful 
had 
ceased 
to 
be 
so. 


The 
taking 
of 
the 
Bastille 
was 
the 
beginning 
of 
one 
of 
those 
phenomena 
of 
mental 
contagion 
which 
abound 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
Revolution. 
The 
foreign 
mercenary 
troops, 
although 
they 
could 
scarcely 
be 
interested 
in 
the 
movement, 
began 
to 
show 
symptoms 
of 
mutiny. 
Louis 
XVI. 
was 
reduced 
to 
accepting 
their 
disbandment. 
He 
recalled 
Necker, 
went 
to 
the 
Hotel 
de 
Ville, 



sanctioned 
by 
his 
presence 
the 
accomplished 
facts, 
and 
accepted 
from 
La 
Fayette, 
commandant 
of 
the 
National 
Guard, 
the 
new 
cockade 
of 
red, 
white, 
and 
blue 
which 
allied 
the 
colours 
of 
Paris 
to 
those 
of 
the 
king. 


Although 
the 
riot 
which 
ended 
in 
the 
taking 
of 
the 
Bastille 
can 
by 
no 
means 
be 
regarded 
as 
``a 
culminating 
fact 
in 
history,'' 
it 
does 
mark 
the 
precise 
moment 
of 
the 
commencement 
of 
popular 
government. 
The 
armed 
people 
thenceforth 
intervened 
daily 
in 
the 
deliberations 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
Assemblies, 
and 
seriously 
influenced 
their 
conduct. 


This 
intervention 
of 
the 
people 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
dogma 
of 
its 
sovereignty 
has 
provoked 
the 
respectful 
admiration 
of 
many 
historians 
of 
the 
Revolution. 
Even 
a 
superficial 
study 
of 
the 
psychology 
of 
crowds 
would 
speedily 
have 
shown 
them 
that 
the 
mystic 
entity 
which 
they 
call 
the 
people 
was 
merely 
translating 
the 
will 
of 
a 
few 
leaders. 
It 
is 
not 
correct 
to 
say 
that 
the 
people 
took 
the 
Bastille, 
attacked 
the 
Tuileries, 
invaded 
the 
Convention, 
&c., 
but 
that 
certain 
leaders—generally 
by 
means 
of 
the 
clubs—united 
armed 
bands 
of 
the 
populace, 
which 
they 
led 
against 
the 
Bastille, 
the 
Tuileries, 
&c. 
During 
the 
Revolution 
the 
same 
crowds 
attacked 
or 
defended 
the 
most 
contrary 
parties, 
according 
to 
the 
leaders 
who 
happened 
to 
be 
at 
their 
heads. 
A 
crowd 
never 
has 
any 
opinion 
but 
that 
of 
its 
leaders. 


Example 
constituting 
one 
of 
the 
most 
potent 
forms 
of 
suggestion, 
the 
taking 
of 
the 
Bastille 
was 
inevitably 
followed 
by 
the 
destruction 
of 
other 
fortresses. 
Many 
chateaux 
were 
regarded 
as 
so 
many 
little 
Bastilles, 
and 
in 
order 
to 
imitate 
the 
Parisians 
who 
had 
destroyed 
theirs 
the 
peasants 
began 
to 
burn 
them. 
They 
did 
so 
with 
the 
greater 
fury 
because 
the 
seigneurial 
homes 
contained 
the 
titles 
of 
feudal 
dues. 
It 
was 
a 
species 
of 
Jacquerie. 


The 
Constituent 
Assembly, 
so 
proud 
and 
haughty 
towards 
the 
king, 
was, 
like 
all 
the 
revolutionary 
assemblies 
which 
followed 
it, 
extremely 
pusillanimous 
before 
the 
people. 


Hoping 
to 
put 
an 
end 
to 
the 
disorders 
of 
the 
night 
of 
August 
4th, 
it 
voted, 
on 
the 
proposition 
of 
a 
member 
of 
the 
nobility, 
the 
Comte 
de 
Noailles, 
the 
abolition 
of 
seigneurial 
rights. 
Although 
this 
measure 
suppressed 
at 
one 
stroke 
the 
privileges 
of 
the 
nobles, 
it 
was 
voted 
with 
tears 
and 
embracings. 
Such 
accesses 
of 
sentimental 
enthusiasm 
are 
readily 
explained 
when 
we 
recall 
how 
contagious 
emotion 
is 
in 
a 
crowd, 
above 
all 
in 
an 
assembly 
oppressed 
by 
fear. 


If 
the 
renunciation 
of 
their 
rights 
had 
been 
effected 
by 
the 
nobility 
a 
few 
years 
earlier, 
the 
Revolution 
would 
doubtless 
have 
been 
avoided, 
but 
it 
was 



now 
too 
late. 
To 
give 
way 
only 
when 
one 
is 
forced 
to 
do 
so 
merely 
increases 
the 
demands 
of 
those 
to 
whom 
one 
yields. 
In 
politics 
one 
should 
always 
look 
ahead 
and 
give 
way 
long 
before 
one 
is 
forced 
to 
do 
so. 


Louis 
XVI. 
hesitated 
for 
two 
months 
to 
ratify 
the 
decisions 
voted 
by 
the 
Assembly 
on 
the 
night 
of 
the 
4th 
of 
August. 
He 
had 
retired 
to 
Versailles. 
The 
leaders 
sent 
thither 
a 
band 
of 
7,000 
or 
8,000 
men 
and 
women 
of 
the 
people, 
assuring 
them 
that 
the 
royal 
residence 
contained 
great 
stores 
of 
bread. 
The 
railings 
of 
the 
palace 
were 
forced, 
some 
of 
the 
bodyguard 
were 
killed, 
and 
the 
king 
and 
all 
his 
family 
were 
led 
back 
to 
Paris 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
a 
shrieking 
crowd, 
many 
of 
whom 
bore 
on 
the 
ends 
of 
their 
pikes 
the 
heads 
of 
the 
soldiers 
massacred. 
The 
dreadful 
journey 
lasted 
six 
hours. 
These 
events 
constituted 
what 
are 
known 
as 
the 
``days'' 
of 
October. 


The 
popular 
power 
increased, 
and 
in 
reality 
the 
king, 
like 
the 
whole 
assembly, 
was 
henceforth 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
people—that 
is, 
at 
the 
mercy 
of 
the 
clubs 
and 
their 
leaders. 
This 
popular 
power 
was 
to 
prevail 
for 
nearly 
ten 
years, 
and 
the 
Revolution 
was 
to 
be 
almost 
entirely 
its 
work. 


While 
proclaiming 
that 
the 
people 
constituted 
the 
only 
sovereign, 
the 
Assembly 
was 
greatly 
embarrassed 
by 
riots 
which 
went 
far 
beyond 
its 
theoretical 
expectations. 
It 
had 
supposed 
that 
order 
would 
be 
restored 
while 
it 
fabricated 
a 
Constitution 
destined 
to 
assure 
the 
eternal 
happiness 
of 
mankind. 


We 
know 
that 
during 
the 
whole 
duration 
of 
the 
Revolution 
one 
of 
the 
chief 
occupations 
of 
the 
assemblies 
was 
to 
make, 
unmake, 
and 
remake 
Constitutions. 
The 
theorists 
attributed 
to 
them 
then, 
as 
they 
do 
to-day, 
the 
power 
of 
transforming 
society; 
the 
Assembly, 
therefore, 
could 
not 
neglect 
its 
task. 
In 
the 
meantime 
it 
published 
a 
solemn 
Declaration 
of 
the 
Rights 
of 
Man 
which 
summarised 
its 
principles. 


The 
Constitution, 
proclamations, 
declarations, 
and 
speeches 
had 
not 
the 
slightest 
effect 
on 
the 
popular 
movements, 
nor 
on 
the 
dissentients 
who 
daily 
increased 
in 
number 
in 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
Assembly. 
The 
latter 
became 
more 
and 
more 
subjected 
to 
the 
ascendancy 
of 
the 
advanced 
party, 
which 
was 
supported 
by 
the 
clubs. 
Danton, 
Camille 
Desmoulins, 
and 
later 
Marat 
and 
Hebert, 
violently 
excited 
the 
populace 
by 
their 
harangues 
and 
their 
journals. 
The 
Assembly 
was 
rapidly 
going 
down 
the 
slope 
that 
leads 
to 
extremes. 


During 
all 
these 
disorders 
the 
finances 
of 
the 
country 
were 
not 
improving. 
Finally 
convinced 
that 
philanthropic 
speeches 
would 
not 
alter 
their 
lamentable 
condition, 
and 
seeing 
that 
bankruptcy 
threatened, 
the 
Assembly 
decreed, 
on 
the 
2nd 
of 
November, 
1789, 
the 
confiscation 
of 
the 
goods 
of 
the 



Church. 
Their 
revenues, 
consisting 
of 
the 
tithes 
collected 
from 
the 
faithful, 
amounted 
to 
some 
L8,000,000, 
and 
their 
value 
was 
estimated 
at 
about 
L120,000,000. 
They 
were 
divided 
among 
some 
hundreds 
of 
prelates, 
Court 
abbes, 
&c., 
who 
owned 
a 
quarter 
of 
all 
France. 
These 
goods, 
henceforth 
entitled 
is 
``national 
domains,'' 
formed 
the 
guarantee 
of 
the 
assignats, 
the 
first 
issue 
of 
which 
was 
for 
400,000,000 
francs 
(L16,000,000 
sterling). 
The 
public 
accepted 
them 
at 
the 
outset, 
but 
they 
multiplied 
so 
under 
the 
Directory 
and 
the 
Convention, 
which 
issued 
45,000,000,000 
francs 
in 
this 
form 
(L1,800,000,000 
sterling), 
that 
an 
assignat 
of 
100 
livres 
was 
finally 
worth 
only 
a 
few 
halfpence. 


Stimulated 
by 
his 
advisers, 
the 
feeble 
Louis 
attempted 
in 
vain 
to 
struggle 
against 
the 
decrees 
of 
the 
Assembly 
by 
refusing 
to 
sanction 
them. 


Under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
daily 
suggestions 
of 
the 
leaders 
and 
the 
power 
of 
mental 
contagion 
the 
revolutionary 
movement 
was 
spreading 
everywhere 
independently 
of 
the 
Assembly 
and 
often 
even 
against 
it. 


In 
the 
towns 
and 
villages 
revolutionary 
municipalities 
were 
instituted, 
protected 
by 
the 
local 
National 
Guards. 
Those 
of 
neighbouring 
towns 
commenced 
to 
make 
mutual 
arrangements 
to 
defend 
themselves 
should 
need 
arise. 
Thus 
federations 
were 
formed, 
which 
were 
soon 
rolled 
into 
one; 
this 
sent 
14,000 
National 
Guards 
to 
Paris, 
who 
assembled 
on 
the 
Champ-de-Mars 
on 
the 
14th 
of 
July, 
1790. 
There 
the 
king 
swore 
to 
maintain 
the 
Constitution 
decreed 
by 
the 
National 
Assembly. 


Despite 
this 
vain 
oath 
it 
became 
more 
evident 
every 
day 
that 
no 
agreement 
was 
possible 
between 
the 
hereditary 
principles 
of 
the 
monarchy 
and 
those 
proclaimed 
by 
the 
Assembly. 


Feeling 
himself 
completely 
powerless, 
the 
king 
thought 
only 
of 
flight. 
Arrested 
at 
Varennes 
and 
brought 
back 
a 
prisoner 
to 
Paris, 
he 
was 
shut 
up 
in 
the 
Tuileries. 
The 
Assembly, 
although 
still 
extremely 
royalist, 
suspended 
him 
from 
power, 
and 
decided 
to 
assume 
the 
sole 
charge 
of 
the 
government. 


Never 
did 
sovereign 
find 
himself 
in 
a 
position 
so 
difficult 
as 
that 
of 
Louis 
at 
the 
time 
of 
his 
flight. 
The 
genius 
of 
a 
Richelieu 
would 
hardly 
have 
extricated 
him. 
The 
only 
element 
of 
defence 
on 
which 
he 
could 
have 
relied 
had 
from 
the 
beginning 
absolutely 
failed 
him. 


During 
the 
whole 
duration 
of 
the 
Constituent 
Assembly 
the 
immense 
majority 
of 
Frenchmen 
and 
of 
the 
Assembly 
remained 
royalist, 
so 
that 
had 
the 
sovereign 
accepted 
a 
liberal 
monarchy 
he 
could 
perhaps 
have 
remained 
in 
power. 
It 
would 
seem 
that 
Louis 
had 
little 
to 
promise 
in 
order 
to 
come 
to 
an 



agreement 
with 
the 
Assembly. 


Little, 
perhaps, 
but 
with 
his 
structure 
of 
mind 
that 
little 
was 
strictly 
impossible. 
All 
the 
shades 
of 
his 
forbears 
would 
have 
risen 
up 
in 
front 
of 
him 
had 
he 
consented 
to 
modify 
the 
mechanism 
of 
the 
monarchy 
inherited 
from 
so 
many 
ancestors. 
And 
even 
had 
he 
attempted 
to 
do 
so, 
the 
opposition 
of 
his 
family, 
the 
clergy, 
the 
nobles, 
and 
the 
Court 
could 
never 
have 
been 
surmounted. 
The 
ancient 
castes 
on 
which 
the 
monarchy 
rested, 
the 
nobility 
and 
the 
clergy, 
were 
then 
almost 
as 
powerful 
as 
the 
monarch 
himself. 
Every 
time 
it 
seemed 
as 
though 
he 
might 
yield 
to 
the 
injunctions 
of 
the 
Assembly 
it 
was 
because 
he 
was 
constrained 
to 
do 
so 
by 
force, 
and 
to 
attempt 
to 
gain 
time. 
His 
appeals 
to 
alien 
Powers 
represented 
the 
resolution 
of 
a 
desperate 
man 
who 
had 
seen 
all 
his 
natural 
defences 
fail 
him. 


He, 
and 
especially 
the 
queen, 
entertained 
the 
strangest 
illusions 
as 
to 
the 
possible 
assistance 
of 
Austria, 
for 
centuries 
the 
rival 
of 
France. 
If 
Austria 
indolently 
consented 
to 
come 
to 
his 
aid, 
it 
was 
only 
in 
the 
hope 
of 
receiving 
a 
great 
reward. 
Mercy 
gave 
him 
to 
understand 
that 
the 
payment 
expected 
consisted 
of 
Alsace, 
the 
Alps, 
and 
Navarre. 


The 
leaders 
of 
the 
clubs, 
finding 
the 
Assembly 
too 
royalist, 
sent 
the 
people 
against 
it. 
A 
petition 
was 
signed, 
inviting 
the 
Assembly 
to 
convoke 
a 
new 
constituent 
power 
to 
proceed 
to 
the 
trial 
of 
Louis 
XVI. 


Monarchical 
in 
spite 
of 
all, 
and 
finding 
that 
the 
Revolution 
was 
assuming 
a 
character 
far 
too 
demagogic, 
the 
Assembly 
resolved 
to 
defend 
itself 
against 
the 
actions 
of 
the 
people. 
A 
battalion 
of 
the 
National 
Guard, 
commanded 
by 
La 
Fayette, 
was 
sent 
to 
the 
Champ-de-Mars, 
where 
the 
crowd 
was 
assembled, 
to 
disperse 
it. 
Fifty 
of 
those 
present 
were 
killed. 


The 
Assembly 
did 
not 
long 
persist 
in 
its 
feeble 
resistance. 
Extremely 
fearful 
of 
the 
people, 
it 
increased 
its 
arrogance 
towards 
the 
king, 
depriving 
him 
every 
day 
of 
some 
part 
of 
his 
prerogatives 
and 
authority. 
He 
was 
now 
scarcely 
more 
than 
a 
mere 
official 
obliged 
to 
execute 
the 
wishes 
of 
others. 


The 
Assembly 
had 
imagined 
that 
it 
would 
be 
able 
to 
exercise 
the 
authority 
of 
which 
it 
had 
deprived 
the 
king, 
but 
such 
a 
task 
was 
infinitely 
above 
its 
resources. 
A 
power 
so 
divided 
is 
always 
weak. 
``I 
know 
nothing 
more 
terrible,'' 
said 
Mirabeau, 
``than 
the 
sovereign 
authority 
of 
six 
hundred 
persons.'' 


Having 
flattered 
itself 
that 
it 
could 
combine 
in 
itself 
all 
the 
powers 
of 
the 
State, 
and 
exercise 
them 
as 
Louis 
XVI. 
had 
done, 
the 
Assembly 
very 
soon 
exercised 
none 
whatever. 



As 
its 
authority 
failed 
anarchy 
increased. 
The 
popular 
leaders 
continually 
stirred 
up 
the 
people. 
Riot 
and 
insurrection 
became 
the 
sole 
power. 
Every 
day 
the 
Assembly 
was 
invaded 
by 
rowdy 
and 
imperious 
delegations 
which 
operated 
by 
means 
of 
threats 
and 
demands. 


All 
these 
popular 
movements, 
which 
the 
Assembly, 
under 
the 
stress 
of 
fear, 
invariably 
obeyed, 
had 
nothing 
spontaneous 
about 
them. 
They 
simply 
represented 
the 
manifestations 
of 
new 
powers—the 
clubs 
and 
the 
Commune 
—which 
had 
been 
set 
up 
beside 
the 
Assembly. 


The 
most 
powerful 
of 
these 
clubs 
was 
the 
Jacobin, 
which 
had 
quickly 
created 
more 
than 
five 
hundred 
branches 
in 
the 
country, 
all 
of 
which 
were 
under 
the 
orders 
of 
the 
central 
body. 
Its 
influence 
remained 
preponderant 
during 
the 
whole 
duration 
of 
the 
Revolution. 
It 
was 
the 
master 
of 
the 
Assembly, 
and 
then 
of 
France, 
its 
only 
rival 
the 
insurrectionary 
Commune, 
whose 
power 
was 
exercised 
only 
in 
Paris. 


The 
weakness 
of 
the 
national 
Assembly 
and 
all 
its 
failures 
had 
made 
it 
extremely 
unpopular. 
It 
became 
conscious 
of 
this, 
and, 
feeling 
that 
it 
was 
every 
day 
more 
powerless, 
decided 
to 
hasten 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
new 
Constitution 
in 
order 
that 
it 
might 
dissolve. 
Its 
last 
action, 
which 
was 
tactless 
enough, 
was 
to 
decree 
that 
no 
member 
of 
the 
Constituent 
Assembly 
should 
be 
elected 
to 
the 
Legislative 
Assembly. 
The 
members 
of 
the 
latter 
were 
thus 
deprived 
of 
the 
experience 
acquired 
by 
their 
predecessors. 


The 
Constitution 
was 
completed 
on 
the 
3rd 
of 
September, 
1791, 
and 
accepted 
on 
the 
13th 
by 
the 
king, 
to 
whom 
the 
Assembly 
had 
restored 
his 
powers. 


This 
Constitution 
organised 
a 
representative 
Government, 
delegating 
the 
legislative 
power 
to 
deputies 
elected 
by 
the 
people, 
and 
the 
executive 
power 
to 
the 
king, 
whose 
right 
of 
veto 
over 
the 
decrees 
of 
the 
Assembly 
was 
recognised. 
New 
departmental 
divisions 
were 
substituted 
for 
the 
old 
provinces. 
The 
imposts 
were 
abolished, 
and 
replaced 
by 
direct 
and 
indirect 
taxes, 
which 
are 
still 
in 
force. 


The 
Assembly, 
which 
had 
just 
altered 
the 
territorial 
divisions 
and 
overthrown 
all 
the 
old 
social 
organisation, 
thought 
itself 
powerful 
enough 
to 
transform 
the 
religious 
organisation 
of 
the 
country 
also. 
It 
claimed 
notably 
that 
the 
members 
of 
the 
clergy 
should 
be 
elected 
by 
the 
people, 
and 
should 
be 
thus 
withdrawn 
from 
the 
influence 
of 
their 
supreme 
head, 
the 
Pope. 


This 
civil 
constitution 
of 
the 
clergy 
was 
the 
origin 
of 
religious 
struggles 
and 
persecutions 
which 
lasted 
until 
the 
days 
of 
the 
Consulate. 
Two-thirds 
of 



the 
priests 
refused 
the 
oath 
demanded 
of 
them. 


During 
the 
three 
years 
which 
represented 
the 
life 
of 
the 
Constituent 
Assembly 
the 
Revolution 
had 
produced 
considerable 
results. 
The 
principal 
result 
was 
perhaps 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
transference 
to 
the 
Third 
Estate 
of 
the 
riches 
of 
the 
privileged 
classes. 
In 
this 
way 
while 
interests 
were 
created 
to 
be 
defended 
fervent 
adherents 
were 
raised 
up 
to 
the 
new 
regime. 
A 
Revolution 
supported 
by 
the 
gratification 
of 
acquired 
appetites 
is 
bound 
to 
be 
powerful. 
The 
Third 
Estate, 
which 
had 
supplanted 
the 
nobles, 
and 
the 
peasants, 
who 
had 
bought 
the 
national 
domains, 
would 
readily 
understand 
that 
the 
restoration 
of 
the 
ancien 
regime 
would 
despoil 
them 
of 
all 
their 
advantages. 
The 
energetic 
defence 
of 
the 
Revolution 
was 
merely 
the 
defence 
of 
their 
own 
fortunes. 


This 
is 
why 
we 
see, 
during 
part 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
nearly 
half 
the 
departments 
vainly 
rising 
against 
the 
despotism 
that 
crushed 
them. 
The 
Republicans 
triumphed 
over 
all 
opposition. 
They 
were 
extremely 
powerful 
in 
that 
they 
had 
to 
defend, 
not 
only 
a 
new 
ideal, 
but 
new 
material 
interests. 
We 
shall 
see 
that 
the 
influence 
of 
these 
two 
factors 
lasted 
during 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
and 
contributed 
powerfully 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Empire. 


CHAPTER 
II 


THE 
PSYCHOLOGY 
OF 
THE 
LEGISLATIVE 
ASSEMBLY 


1. 
Political 
Events 
during 
the 
Life 
of 
the 
Legislative 
Assembly. 
Before 
examining 
the 
mental 
characteristics 
of 
the 
Legislative 
Assembly 
let 
us 
briefly 
sum 
up 
the 
considerable 
political 
events 
which 
marked 
its 
short 
year's 
life. 
They 
naturally 
played 
an 
important 
part 
in 
respect 
of 
its 
psychological 
manifestations. 


Extremely 
monarchical, 
the 
Legislative 
Assembly 
had 
no 
more 
idea 
than 
its 
predecessor 
of 
destroying 
the 
monarchy. 
The 
king 
appeared 
to 
it 
to 
be 
slightly 
suspect, 
but 
it 
still 
hoped 
to 
be 
able 
to 
retain 
him 
on 
the 
throne. 


Unhappily 
for 
him, 
Louis 
was 
incessantly 
begging 
for 
intervention 
from 
abroad. 
Shut 
up 
in 
the 
Tuileries, 
defended 
only 
by 
his 
Swiss 
Guards, 
the 
timid 
sovereign 
was 
drifting 
among 
contrary 
influences. 
He 
subsidised 
journals 
intended 
to 
modify 
public 
opinion, 
but 
the 
obscure 
``penny-a-liners'' 



who 
edited 
them 
knew 
nothing 
of 
acting 
on 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
crowd. 
Their 
only 
means 
of 
persuasion 
was 
to 
menace 
with 
the 
gallows 
all 
the 
partisans 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
and 
to 
predict 
the 
invasion 
of 
France 
by 
an 
army 
which 
would 
rescue 
the 
king. 


Royalty 
no 
longer 
counted 
on 
anything 
but 
the 
foreign 
Courts. 
The 
nobles 
were 
emigrating. 
Prussia, 
Austria, 
and 
Russia 
were 
threatening 
France 
with 
a 
war 
of 
invasion. 
The 
Court 
favoured 
their 
lead. 
To 
the 
coalition 
of 
the 
three 
kings 
against 
France 
the 
Jacobin 
Club 
proposed 
to 
oppose 
a 
league 
of 
peoples. 
The 
Girondists 
were 
then, 
with 
the 
Jacobins, 
at 
the 
head 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
movement. 
They 
incited 
the 
masses 
to 
arm 
themselves— 
600,000 
volunteers 
were 
equipped. 
The 
Court 
accepted 
a 
Girondist 
minister. 
Dominated 
by 
him, 
Louis 
XVI. 
was 
obliged 
to 
propose 
to 
the 
Assembly 
a 
war 
against 
Austria. 
It 
was 
immediately 
agreed 
to. 


In 
declaring 
war 
the 
king 
was 
not 
sincere. 
The 
queen 
revealed 
the 
French 
plans 
of 
campaign 
and 
the 
secret 
deliberations 
of 
the 
Council 
to 
the 
Austrians. 


The 
beginnings 
of 
the 
struggle 
were 
disastrous. 
Several 
columns 
of 
troops, 
attacked 
by 
panic, 
disbanded. 
Stimulated 
by 
the 
clubs, 
and 
persuaded 
—justly, 
for 
that 
matter—that 
the 
king 
was 
conspiring 
with 
the 
enemies 
of 
France, 
the 
population 
of 
the 
faubourgs 
rose 
in 
insurrection. 
Its 
leaders, 
the 
Jacobins, 
and 
above 
all 
Danton, 
sent 
to 
the 
Tuileries 
on 
the 
20th 
of 
June 
a 
petition 
threatening 
the 
king 
with 
revocation. 
It 
then 
invaded 
the 
Tuileries, 
heaping 
invectives 
on 
the 
sovereign. 


Fatality 
impelled 
Louis 
toward 
his 
tragic 
destiny. 
While 
the 
threats 
of 
the 
Jacobins 
against 
royalty 
had 
roused 
many 
of 
the 
departments 
to 
indignation, 
it 
was 
learned 
that 
a 
Prussian 
army 
had 
arrived 
on 
the 
frontiers 
of 
Lorraine. 


The 
hope 
of 
the 
king 
and 
queen 
respecting 
the 
help 
to 
be 
obtained 
from 
abroad 
was 
highly 
chimerical. 
Marie-Antoinette 
suffered 
from 
an 
absolute 
illusion 
as 
to 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
Austrian 
and 
the 
French 
peoples. 
Seeing 
France 
terrorised 
by 
a 
few 
energumens, 
she 
supposed 
that 
it 
would 
be 
equally 
easy 
to 
terrify 
the 
Parisians, 
and 
by 
means 
of 
threats 
to 
lead 
them 
back 
under 
the 
king's 
authority. 
Inspired 
by 
her, 
Fersen 
undertook 
to 
publish 
the 
manifesto 
of 
the 
Duke 
of 
Brunswick, 
threatening 
Paris 
with 
``total 
subversion 
if 
the 
royal 
family 
were 
molested.'' 


The 
effect 
produced 
was 
diametrically 
opposite 
to 
that 
intended. 
The 
manifesto 
aroused 
indignation 
against 
the 
monarch, 
who 
was 
regarded 
as 
an 
accomplice, 
and 
increased 
his 
unpopularity. 
From 
that 
day 
he 
was 
marked 
for 



the 
scaffold. 


Carried 
away 
by 
Danton, 
the 
delegates 
of 
the 
sections 
installed 
themselves 
at 
the 
Hotel 
de 
Ville 
as 
an 
insurrectionary 
Commune, 
which 
arrested 
the 
commandant 
of 
the 
National 
Guard, 
who 
was 
devoted 
to 
the 
king, 
sounded 
the 
tocsin, 
equipped 
the 
National 
Guard, 
and 
on 
the 
10th 
of 
August 
hurled 
them, 
with 
the 
populace, 
against 
the 
Tuileries. 
The 
regiments 
called 
in 
by 
Louis 
disbanded 
themselves. 
Soon 
none 
were 
left 
to 
defend 
him 
but 
his 
Swiss 
and 
a 
few 
gentlemen. 
Nearly 
all 
were 
killed. 
Left 
alone, 
the 
king 
took 
refuge 
with 
the 
Assembly. 
The 
crowds 
demanded 
his 
denouncement. 
The 
Legislative 
Assembly 
decreed 
his 
suspension 
and 
left 
a 
future 
Assembly, 
the 
Convention, 
to 
decide 
upon 
his 
fate. 


2. 
Mental 
Characteristics 
of 
the 
Legislative 
Assembly. 
The 
Legislative 
Assembly, 
formed 
of 
new 
men, 
presented 
quite 
a 
special 
interest 
from 
the 
psychological 
point 
of 
view. 
Few 
assemblies 
have 
offered 
in 
such 
a 
degree 
the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
political 
collectivity. 


It 
comprised 
seven 
hundred 
and 
fifty 
deputies, 
divided 
into 
pure 
royalists, 
constitutional 
royalists, 
republicans, 
Girondists, 
and 
Montagnards. 
Advocates 
and 
men 
of 
letters 
formed 
the 
majority. 
It 
also 
contained, 
but 
in 
smaller 
numbers, 
superior 
officers, 
priests, 
and 
a 
very 
few 
scientists. 


The 
philosophical 
conceptions 
of 
the 
members 
of 
this 
Assembly 
seem 
rudimentary 
enough. 
Many 
were 
imbued 
with 
Rousseau's 
idea 
of 
a 
return 
to 
a 
state 
of 
nature. 
But 
all, 
like 
their 
predecessors, 
were 
dominated 
more 
especially 
by 
recollections 
of 
Greek 
and 
Latin 
antiquity. 
Cato, 
Brutus, 
Gracchus, 
Plutarch, 
Marcus 
Aurelius, 
and 
Plato, 
continually 
evoked, 
furnished 
the 
images 
of 
their 
speech. 
When 
the 
orator 
wished 
to 
insult 
Louis 


XVI. 
he 
called 
him 
Caligula. 
In 
hoping 
to 
destroy 
tradition 
they 
were 
revolutionaries, 
but 
in 
claiming 
to 
return 
to 
a 
remote 
past 
they 
showed 
themselves 
extremely 
reactionary. 
For 
the 
rest, 
all 
these 
theories 
had 
very 
little 
influence 
on 
their 
conduct. 
Reason 
was 
continually 
figuring 
in 
their 
speeches, 
but 
never 
in 
their 
actions. 
These 
were 
always 
dominated 
by 
those 
affective 
and 
mystic 
elements 
whose 
potency 
we 
have 
so 
often 
demonstrated. 


The 
psychological 
characteristics 
of 
the 
Legislative 
Assembly 
were 
those 
of 
the 
Constituent 
Assembly, 
but 
were 
greatly 
accentuated. 
They 
may 
be 



summed 
up 
in 
four 
words: 
impressionability, 
mobility, 
timidity, 
and 
weakness. 


This 
mobility 
and 
impressionability 
are 
revealed 
in 
the 
constant 
variability 
of 
their 
conduct. 
One 
day 
they 
exchange 
noisy 
invective 
and 
blows. 
On 
the 
following 
day 
we 
see 
them 
``throwing 
themselves 
into 
one 
another's 
arms 
with 
torrents 
of 
tears.'' 
They 
eagerly 
applaud 
an 
address 
demanding 
the 
punishment 
of 
those 
who 
have 
petitioned 
for 
the 
king's 
dethronement, 
and 
the 
same 
day 
accord 
the 
honours 
of 
the 
session 
to 
a 
delegation 
which 
has 
come 
to 
demand 
his 
downfall. 


The 
pusillanimity 
and 
weakness 
of 
the 
Assembly 
in 
the 
face 
of 
threats 
was 
extreme. 
Although 
royalist 
it 
voted 
the 
suspension 
of 
the 
king, 
and 
on 
the 
demand 
of 
the 
Commune 
delivered 
him, 
with 
his 
family, 
to 
be 
imprisoned 
in 
the 
Temple, 


Thanks 
to 
its 
weakness, 
it 
was 
as 
incapable 
as 
the 
Constituent 
Assembly 
of 
exercising 
any 
power, 
and 
allowed 
itself 
to 
be 
dominated 
by 
the 
Commune 
and 
the 
clubs, 
which 
were 
directed 
by 
such 
influential 
leaders 
as 
Hebert, 
Tallien, 
Rossignol, 
Marat, 
Robespierre, 
&c. 


Until 
Thermidor, 
1794, 
the 
insurrectionary 
Commune 
constituted 
the 
chief 
power 
in 
the 
State, 
and 
behaved 
precisely 
as 
if 
it 
had 
been 
charged 
with 
the 
government 
of 
Paris. 


It 
was 
the 
Commune 
that 
demanded 
the 
imprisonment 
of 
Louis 
XVI. 
in 
the 
tower 
of 
the 
Temple, 
when 
the 
Assembly 
wished 
to 
imprison 
him 
in 
the 
palace 
of 
the 
Luxembourg. 
It 
was 
the 
Commune 
again 
that 
filled 
the 
prisons 
with 
suspects, 
and 
then 
ordered 
them 
to 
be 
killed. 


We 
know 
with 
what 
refinements 
of 
cruelty 
a 
handful 
of 
some 
150 
bandits, 
paid 
at 
the 
rate 
of 
24 
livres 
a 
day, 
and 
directed 
by 
a 
few 
members 
of 
the 
Commune, 
exterminated 
some 
1,200 
persons 
in 
four 
days. 
This 
crime 
was 
known 
as 
the 
massacre 
of 
September. 
The 
mayor 
of 
Paris, 
Petion, 
received 
the 
band 
of 
assassins 
with 
respect, 
and 
gave 
them 
drink. 
A 
few 
Girondists 
protested 
somewhat, 
but 
the 
Jacobins 
were 
silent. 


The 
terrorised 
Assembly 
affected 
at 
first 
to 
ignore 
the 
massacres, 
which 
were 
encouraged 
by 
several 
of 
its 
more 
influential 
deputies, 
notably 
Couthon 
and 
Billaud-Varenne. 
When 
at 
last 
it 
decided 
to 
condemn 
them 
it 
was 
without 
attempting 
to 
prevent 
their 
continuation. 


Conscious 
of 
its 
impotence, 
the 
Legislative 
Assembly 
dissolved 
itself 
a 
fortnight 
later 
in 
order 
to 
give 
way 
to 
the 
Convention. 


Its 
work 
was 
obviously 
disastrous, 
not 
in 
intention 
but 
in 
fact. 
Royalist, 
it 



abandoned 
the 
monarchy; 
humanitarian, 
it 
allowed 
the 
massacres 
of 
September; 
pacific, 
it 
pushed 
France 
into 
a 
formidable 
war, 
thus 
showing 
that 
a 
weak 
Government 
always 
ends 
by 
bringing 
ruin 
upon 
its 
country. 


The 
history 
of 
the 
two 
previous 
revolutionary 
Assemblies 
proves 
once 
more 
to 
what 
point 
events 
carry 
within 
them 
their 
inevitable 
consequences. 
They 
constitute 
a 
train 
of 
necessities 
of 
which 
we 
can 
sometimes 
choose 
the 
first, 
but 
which 
then 
evolve 
without 
consulting 
us. 
We 
are 
free 
to 
make 
a 
decision, 
but 
powerless 
to 
avert 
its 
consequences. 


The 
first 
measures 
of 
the 
Constituent 
Assembly 
were 
rational 
and 
voluntary, 
but 
the 
results 
which 
followed 
were 
beyond 
all 
will 
or 
reason 
or 
foresight. 


Which 
of 
the 
men 
of 
1789 
would 
have 
ventured 
to 
desire 
or 
predict 
the 
death 
of 
Louis 
XVI., 
the 
wars 
of 
La 
Vendee, 
the 
Terror, 
the 
permanent 
guillotine 
and 
the 
final 
anarchy, 
or 
the 
ensuing 
return 
to 
tradition 
and 
order, 
guided 
by 
the 
iron 
hand 
of 
a 
soldier? 


In 
the 
development 
of 
events 
which 
ensued 
from 
the 
early 
actions 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
Assemblies 
the 
most 
striking, 
perhaps, 
was 
the 
rise 
and 
development 
of 
the 
government 
of 
the 
crowd—of 
mob 
rule. 


Behind 
the 
facts 
which 
we 
have 
been 
considering—the 
taking 
of 
the 
Bastille, 
the 
invasion 
of 
Versailles, 
the 
massacres 
of 
September, 
the 
attack 
on 
the 
Tuileries, 
the 
murder 
of 
the 
Swiss 
Guards, 
and 
the 
downfall 
and 
imprisonment 
of 
the 
king—we 
can 
readily 
perceive 
the 
laws 
affecting 
the 
psychology 
of 
crowds 
and 
their 
leaders. 


We 
shall 
now 
see 
that 
the 
power 
of 
the 
multitude 
will 
progressively 
increase, 
overcome 
all 
other 
powers, 
and 
finally 
replace 
them. 


CHAPTER 
III 


THE 
PSYCHOLOGY 
OF 
THE 
CONVENTION 


1. 
The 
Legend 
of 
the 
Convention. 
The 
history 
of 
the 
Convention 
is 
not 
merely 
fertile 
in 
psychological 
documents. 
It 
also 
shows 
how 
powerless 
the 
witnesses 
of 
any 
period 
and 
even 
their 
immediate 
successors 
are 
to 
form 
an 
exact 
idea 
of 
the 
events 
which 
they 
have 
witnessed, 
and 
the 
men 
who 
have 
surrounded 
them. 



More 
than 
a 
century 
has 
elapsed 
since 
the 
Revolution, 
and 
men 
are 
only 
just 
beginning 
to 
form 
judgments 
concerning 
this 
period 
which, 
if 
still 
often 
doubtful 
enough, 
are 
slightly 
more 
accurate 
than 
of 
old. 


This 
happens, 
not 
only 
because 
new 
documents 
are 
being 
drawn 
from 
the 
archives, 
but 
because 
the 
legends 
which 
enveloped 
that 
sanguinary 
period 
in 
a 
magical 
cloud 
are 
gradually 
vanishing 
with 
the 
passage 
of 
time. 


Perhaps 
the 
most 
tenacious 
legend 
of 
all 
was 
that 
which 
until 
formerly 
used 
to 
surround 
the 
personages 
to 
whom 
our 
fathers 
applied 
the 
glorious 
epithet, 
``the 
Giants 
of 
the 
Convention.'' 


The 
struggles 
of 
the 
Convention 
against 
France 
in 
insurrection 
and 
Europe 
in 
arms 
produced 
such 
an 
impression 
that 
the 
heroes 
of 
this 
formidable 
struggle 
seemed 
to 
belong 
to 
a 
race 
of 
supermen 
or 
Titans. 


The 
epithet 
``giant'' 
seemed 
justified 
so 
long 
as 
the 
events 
of 
the 
period 
were 
confused 
and 
massed 
together. 
Regarded 
as 
connected 
when 
it 
was 
simply 
simultaneous, 
the 
work 
of 
the 
armies 
was 
confounded 
with 
that 
of 
the 
Convention. 
The 
glory 
of 
the 
first 
recoiled 
upon 
the 
second, 
and 
served 
as 
an 
excuse 
for 
the 
hecatombs 
of 
the 
Terror, 
the 
ferocity 
of 
the 
civil 
war, 
and 
the 
devastation 
of 
France. 


Under 
the 
penetrating 
scrutiny 
of 
modern 
criticism, 
the 
heterogeneous 
mass 
of 
events 
has 
been 
slowly 
disentangled. 
The 
armies 
of 
the 
Republic 
have 
retained 
their 
old 
prestige, 
but 
we 
have 
been 
forced 
to 
recognise 
that 
the 
men 
of 
the 
Convention, 
absorbed 
entirely 
by 
their 
intestine 
conflicts, 
had 
very 
little 
to 
do 
with 
their 
victories. 
At 
the 
most 
two 
or 
three 
members 
of 
the 
committees 
of 
the 
Assembly 
were 
concerned 
with 
the 
armies, 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
were 
victorious 
was 
due, 
apart 
from 
their 
numbers 
and 
the 
talents 
of 
their 
young 
generals, 
to 
the 
enthusiasm 
with 
which 
a 
new 
faith 
had 
inspired 
them. 


In 
a 
later 
chapter, 
devoted 
to 
the 
revolutionary 
armies, 
we 
shall 
see 
how 
they 
conquered 
Europe 
in 
arms. 
They 
set 
out 
inspired 
by 
the 
ideas 
of 
liberty 
and 
equality 
which 
constituted 
the 
new 
gospel, 
and 
once 
on 
the 
frontiers, 
which 
were 
to 
keep 
them 
so 
long, 
they 
retained 
a 
special 
mentality, 
very 
different 
from 
that 
of 
the 
Government, 
which 
they 
first 
knew 
nothing 
of 
and 
afterwards 
despised. 


Having 
no 
part 
whatever 
in 
their 
victories, 
the 
men 
of 
the 
Convention 
contented 
themselves 
with 
legislating 
at 
hazard 
according 
to 
the 
injunctions 
of 
the 
leaders 
who 
directed 
them, 
and 
who 
claimed 
to 
be 
regenerating 
France 
by 
means 
of 
the 
guillotine. 



But 
it 
was 
thanks 
to 
these 
valiant 
armies 
that 
the 
history 
of 
the 
Convention 
was 
transformed 
into 
an 
apotheosis 
which 
affected 
several 
generations 
with 
a 
religious 
respect 
which 
even 
to-day 
is 
hardly 
extinct. 


Studying 
in 
detail 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
``Giants'' 
of 
the 
Convention, 
we 
find 
their 
magnitude 
shrink 
very 
rapidly. 
They 
were 
in 
general 
extremely 
mediocre. 
Their 
most 
fervent 
defenders, 
such 
as 
M. 
Aulard, 
are 
obliged 
to 
admit 
as 
much. 


This 
is 
how 
M. 
Aulard 
puts 
it 
in 
his 
History 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution:— 


``It 
has 
been 
said 
that 
the 
generation 
which 
from 
1789 
to 
1799 
did 
such 
great 
and 
terrible 
things 
was 
a 
generation 
of 
giants, 
or, 
to 
put 
it 
more 
plainly, 
that 
it 
was 
a 
generation 
more 
distinguished 
than 
that 
which 
preceded 
it 
or 
that 
which 
followed. 


This 
is 
a 
retrospective 
illusion. 
The 
citizens 
who 
formed 
the 
municipal 
and 
Jacobin 
or 
nationalist 
groups 
by 
which 
the 
Revolution 
was 
effected 
do 
not 
seem 
to 
have 
been 
superior, 
either 
in 
enlightenment 
or 
in 
talents, 
to 
the 
Frenchmen 
of 
the 
time 
of 
Louis 
XV. 
or 
of 
Louis 
Philippe. 
Were 
those 
exceptionally 
gifted 
whose 
names 
history 
has 
retained 
because 
they 
appeared 
on 
the 
stage 
of 
Paris, 
or 
because 
they 
were 
the 
most 
brilliant 
orators 
of 
the 
various 
revolutionary 
Assemblies? 
Mirabeau, 
up 
to 
a 
certain 
point, 
deserved 
the 
title 
of 
genius; 
but 
as 
to 
the 
rest— 
Robespierre, 
Danton, 
Vergniaud—had 
they 
truly 
more 
talent, 
for 
example, 
than 
our 
modern 
orators? 
In 
1793, 
in 
the 
time 
of 
the 
supposed 
`giants,' 
Mme. 
Roland 
wrote 
in 
her 
memoirs: 
`France 
was 
as 
though 
drained 
of 
men; 
their 
dearth 
during 
this 
revolution 
is 
truly 
surprising; 
there 
have 
scarcely 
been 
any 
but 
pigmies.' 
'' 


If 
after 
considering 
the 
men 
of 
the 
Convention 
individually 
we 
consider 
them 
in 
a 
body, 
we 
may 
say 
that 
they 
did 
not 
shine 
either 
by 
intelligence 
or 
by 
virtue 
or 
by 
courage. 
Never 
did 
a 
body 
of 
men 
manifest 
such 
pusillanimity. 
They 
had 
no 
courage 
save 
in 
their 
speeches 
or 
in 
respect 
of 
remote 
dangers. 
This 
Assembly, 
so 
proud 
and 
threatening 
in 
its 
speech 
when 
addressing 
royalty, 
was 
perhaps 
the 
most 
timid 
and 
docile 
political 
collectivity 
that 
the 
world 
has 
ever 
known. 
We 
see 
it 
slavishly 
obedient 
to 
the 
orders 
of 
the 
clubs 
and 
the 
Commune, 
trembling 
before 
the 
popular 
delegations 
which 
invaded 
it 
daily, 
and 
obeying 
the 
injunctions 
of 
the 
rioters 
to 
the 
point 
of 
handing 
over 
to 
them 
its 
most 
brilliant 
members. 
The 
Convention 
affords 
the 
world 
a 
melancholy 
spectacle, 
voting, 
at 
the 
popular 
behest, 
laws 
so 
absurd 
that 
it 
is 
obliged 
to 
annul 
them 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
rioters 



have 
quitted 
the 
hall. 


Few 
Assemblies 
have 
given 
proof 
of 
such 
weakness. 
When 
we 
wish 
to 
show 
how 
low 
a 
popular 
Government 
can 
fall 
we 
have 
only 
to 
point 
to 
the 
Convention. 


2. 
Results 
of 
the 
Triumph 
of 
the 
Jacobin 
Religion 
Among 
the 
causes 
that 
gave 
the 
Convention 
its 
special 
physiognomy, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
was 
the 
definite 
establishment 
of 
a 
revolutionary 
religion. 
A 
dogma 
which 
was 
at 
first 
in 
process 
of 
formation 
was 
at 
last 
finally 
erected. 


This 
dogma 
was 
composed 
of 
an 
aggregate 
of 
somewhat 
inconsistent 
elements. 
Nature, 
the 
rights 
of 
man, 
liberty, 
equality, 
the 
social 
contract, 
hatred 
of 
tyrants, 
and 
popular 
sovereignty 
formed 
the 
articles 
of 
a 
gospel 
which, 
to 
its 
disciples, 
was 
above 
discussion. 
The 
new 
truths 
had 
found 
apostles 
who 
were 
certain 
of 
their 
power, 
and 
who 
finally, 
like 
believers 
all 
the 
world 
over, 
sought 
to 
impose 
them 
by 
force. 
No 
heed 
should 
be 
taken 
of 
the 
opinion 
of 
unbelievers; 
they 
all 
deserved 
to 
be 
exterminated. 


The 
hatred 
of 
heretics 
having 
been 
always, 
as 
we 
have 
seen, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Reformation, 
an 
irreducible 
characteristic 
of 
great 
beliefs, 
we 
can 
readily 
comprehend 
the 
intolerance 
of 
the 
Jacobin 
religion. 


The 
history 
of 
the 
Reformation 
proves 
also 
that 
the 
conflict 
between 
two 
allied 
beliefs 
is 
very 
bitter. 
We 
must 
not, 
therefore, 
be 
astonished 
that 
in 
the 
Convention 
the 
Jacobins 
fought 
furiously 
against 
the 
other 
republicans, 
whose 
faith 
hardly 
differed 
from 
their 
own. 


The 
propaganda 
of 
the 
new 
apostles 
was 
very 
energetic. 
To 
convert 
the 
provinces 
they 
sent 
thither 
zealous 
disciples 
escorted 
by 
guillotines. 
The 
inquisitors 
of 
the 
new 
faith 
would 
have 
no 
paltering 
with 
error. 
As 
Robespierre 
said, 
``The 
republic 
is 
the 
destruction 
of 
everything 
that 
is 
opposed 
to 
it.'' 
What 
matter 
that 
the 
country 
refused 
to 
be 
regenerated? 
It 
should 
be 
regenerated 
despite 
itself. 
``We 
will 
make 
a 
cemetery 
of 
France,'' 
said 
Carrier, 
``rather 
than 
fail 
to 
regenerate 
it 
in 
our 
own 
way.'' 


The 
Jacobin 
policy 
derived 
from 
the 
new 
faith 
was 
very 
simple. 
It 
consisted 
in 
a 
sort 
of 
equalitarian 
Socialism, 
directed 
by 
a 
dictatorship 
which 
would 
brook 
no 
opposition. 


Of 
practical 
ideas 
consistent 
with 
the 
economic 
necessities 
and 
the 
true 



nature 
of 
man, 
the 
theorists 
who 
ruled 
France 
would 
have 
nothing 
to 
say. 
Speech 
and 
the 
guillotine 
sufficed 
them. 
Their 
speeches 
were 
childish. 
``Never 
a 
fact,'' 
says 
Taine, 
``nothing 
but 
abstractions, 
strings 
of 
sentences 
about 
Nature, 
reason, 
the 
people, 
tyrants, 
liberty: 
like 
so 
many 
puffed-out 
balloons 
uselessly 
jostling 
in 
space. 
If 
we 
did 
not 
know 
that 
it 
all 
ended 
in 
practical 
and 
dreadful 
results, 
we 
should 
think 
they 
were 
games 
of 
logic, 
school 
exercises, 
academical 
demonstrations, 
ideological 
combinations.'' 


The 
theories 
of 
the 
Jacobins 
amounted 
practically 
to 
an 
absolute 
tyranny. 
To 
them 
it 
seemed 
evident 
that 
a 
sovereign 
State 
must 
be 
obeyed 
without 
discussion 
by 
citizens 
rendered 
equal 
as 
to 
conditions 
and 
fortune. 


The 
power 
with 
which 
they 
invested 
themselves 
was 
far 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
the 
monarchs 
who 
had 
preceded 
them. 
They 
fixed 
the 
prices 
of 
merchandise 
and 
arrogated 
the 
right 
to 
dispose 
of 
the 
life 
and 
property 
of 
citizens. 


Their 
confidence 
in 
the 
regenerative 
virtues 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
faith 
was 
such 
that 
after 
having 
declared 
war 
upon 
kings 
they 
declared 
war 
upon 
the 
gods. 
A 
calendar 
was 
established 
from 
which 
the 
saints 
were 
banished. 
They 
created 
a 
new 
divinity, 
Reason, 
whose 
worship 
was 
celebrated 
in 
Notre-
Dame, 
with 
ceremonies 
which 
were 
in 
many 
ways 
identical 
with 
those 
of 
the 
Catholic 
faith, 
upon 
the 
altar 
of 
the 
``late 
Holy 
Virgin.'' 
This 
cult 
lasted 
until 
Robespierre 
substituted 
a 
personal 
religion 
of 
which 
he 
constituted 
himself 
the 
high 
priest. 


The 
sole 
masters 
of 
France, 
the 
Jacobins 
and 
their 
disciples 
were 
able 
to 
plunder 
the 
country 
with 
impunity, 
although 
they 
were 
never 
in 
the 
majority 
anywhere. 


Their 
numbers 
are 
not 
easy 
to 
determine 
exactly. 
We 
know 
only 
that 
they 
were 
very 
small. 
Taine 
valued 
them 
at 
5,000 
in 
Paris, 
among 
700,000 
inhabitants; 
in 
Besancon 
300 
among 
300,000; 
and 
in 
all 
France 
about 
300,000. 


``A 
small 
feudality 
of 
brigands, 
set 
over 
a 
conquered 
France,'' 
according 
to 
the 
words 
of 
the 
same 
author, 
they 
were 
able, 
in 
spite 
of 
their 
small 
numbers, 
to 
dominate 
the 
country, 
and 
this 
for 
several 
reasons. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
their 
faith 
gave 
them 
a 
considerable 
strength. 
Then, 
because 
they 
represented 
the 
Government, 
and 
for 
centuries 
the 
French 
had 
obeyed 
those 
who 
were 
in 
command. 
Finally, 
because 
it 
was 
believed 
that 
to 
overthrow 
them 
would 
be 
to 
bring 
back 
the 
ancien 
regime, 
which 
was 
greatly 
dreaded 
by 
the 
numerous 
purchasers 
of 
the 
national 
domains. 
Their 
tyranny 
must 
have 



grown 
frightful 
indeed 
to 
force 
so 
many 
departments 
to 
rise 
against 
them. 


The 
first 
factor 
of 
their 
power 
was 
very 
important. 
In 
the 
conflict 
between 
powerful 
faiths 
and 
weak 
faiths 
victory 
never 
falls 
to 
the 
latter. 
A 
powerful 
faith 
creates 
strong 
wills, 
which 
will 
always 
overpower 
weak 
wills. 
That 
the 
Jacobins 
themselves 
did 
finally 
perish 
was 
because 
their 
accumulated 
violence 
had 
bound 
together 
thousands 
of 
weak 
wills 
whose 
united 
weight 
overbalanced 
their 
own 
strong 
wills. 


It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
Girondists, 
whom 
the 
Jacobins 
persecuted 
with 
so 
much 
hatred, 
had 
also 
well-established 
beliefs, 
but 
in 
the 
struggle 
which 
ensued 
their 
education 
told 
against 
them, 
together 
with 
their 
respect 
for 
certain 
traditions 
and 
the 
rights 
of 
others, 
scruples 
which 
did 
not 
in 
the 
least 
trouble 
their 
adversaries. 


``The 
majority 
of 
the 
sentiments 
of 
the 
Girondists,'' 
writes 
Emile 
Ollivier, 
``were 
delicate 
and 
generous; 
those 
of 
the 
Jacobin 
mob 
were 
low, 
gross, 
and 
brutal. 
The 
name 
of 
Vergniaud, 
compared 
with 
that 
of 
the 
`divine' 
Marat, 
measures 
a 
gulf 
which 
nothing 
could 
span.'' 


Dominating 
the 
Convention 
at 
the 
outset 
by 
the 
superiority 
of 
their 
talents 
and 
their 
eloquence, 
the 
Girondists 
soon 
fell 
under 
the 
domination 
of 
the 
Montagnards—worthless 
energumens, 
who 
carried 
little 
weight, 
but 
were 
always 
active, 
and 
who 
knew 
how 
to 
excite 
the 
passions 
of 
the 
populace. 
It 
was 
violence 
and 
not 
talent 
that 
impressed 
the 
Assemblies. 


3. 
Mental 
Characteristics 
of 
the 
Convention. 
Beside 
the 
characteristics 
common 
to 
all 
assemblies 
there 
are 
some 
created 
by 
influences 
of 
environment 
and 
circumstances, 
which 
give 
any 
particular 
assembly 
of 
men 
a 
special 
physiognomy. 
Most 
of 
the 
characteristics 
observable 
in 
the 
Constituent 
and 
Legislative 
Assemblies 
reappeared, 
in 
an 
exaggerated 
form, 
in 
the 
Convention. 


This 
Assembly 
comprised 
about 
seven 
hundred 
and 
fifty 
deputies, 
of 
whom 
rather 
more 
than 
a 
third 
had 
sat 
in 
the 
Constituent 
or 
the 
Legislative 
Assembly. 
By 
terrorising 
the 
population 
the 
Jacobins 
contrived 
to 
triumph 
at 
the 
elections. 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
electors, 
six 
millions 
out 
of 
seven, 
preferred 
to 
abstain 
from 
voting. 


As 
to 
the 
professions, 
the 
Assembly 
contained 
a 
large 
number 
of 
lawyers, 
advocates, 
notaries, 
bailiffs, 
ex-magistrates, 
and 
a 
few 
literary 
men. 



The 
mentality 
of 
the 
Convention 
was 
not 
homogeneous. 
Now, 
an 
assembly 
composed 
of 
individuals 
of 
widely 
different 
characters 
soon 
splits 
up 
into 
a 
number 
of 
groups. 
The 
Convention 
very 
early 
contained 
three—the 
Gironde, 
the 
Mountain, 
and 
the 
Plain. 
The 
constitutional 
monarchists 
had 
almost 
disappeared. 


The 
Gironde 
and 
the 
Mountain, 
extreme 
parties, 
consisted 
of 
about 
a 
hundred 
members 
apiece, 
who 
successively 
became 
leaders. 
In 
the 
Mountain 
were 
the 
most 
advanced 
members: 
Couthon, 
Herault 
de 
Sechelles, 
Danton, 
Camille 
Desmoulins, 
Marat, 
Collot 
d'Herbois, 
Billaud-Varennes, 
Barras, 
Saint-Just, 
Fouche, 
Tallien, 
Carrier, 
Robespierre, 
&c. 
In 
the 
Gironde 
were 
Brissot, 
Petion, 
Condorcet, 
Vergniaud, 
&c. 


The 
five 
hundred 
other 
members 
of 
the 
Assembly—that 
is, 
the 
great 
majority—constituted 
what 
was 
known 
as 
the 
Plain. 


This 
latter 
formed 
a 
floating 
mass, 
silent, 
undecided, 
and 
timid; 
ready 
to 
follow 
every 
impulse 
and 
to 
be 
carried 
away 
by 
the 
excitement 
of 
the 
moment. 
It 
gave 
ear 
indifferently 
to 
the 
stronger 
of 
the 
two 
preceding 
groups. 
After 
obeying 
the 
Gironde 
for 
some 
time 
it 
allowed 
itself 
to 
be 
led 
away 
by 
the 
Mountain, 
when 
the 
latter 
triumphed 
over 
its 
enemy. 
This 
was 
a 
natural 
consequence 
of 
the 
law 
already 
stated, 
by 
which 
the 
weak 
invariably 
fall 
under 
the 
dominion 
of 
the 
stronger 
wills. 


The 
influence 
of 
great 
manipulators 
of 
men 
was 
displayed 
in 
a 
high 
degree 
during 
the 
Convention. 
It 
was 
constantly 
led 
by 
a 
violent 
minority 
of 
narrow 
minds, 
whose 
intense 
convictions 
lent 
them 
great 
strength. 


A 
brutal 
and 
audacious 
minority 
will 
always 
lead 
a 
fearful 
and 
irresolute 
majority. 
This 
explains 
the 
constant 
tendency 
toward 
extremes 
to 
be 
observed 
in 
all 
revolutionary 
assemblies. 
The 
history 
of 
the 
Convention 
verifies 
once 
more 
the 
law 
of 
acceleration 
studied 
in 
another 
chapter. 


The 
men 
of 
the 
Convention 
were 
thus 
bound 
to 
pass 
from 
moderation 
to 
greater 
and 
greater 
violence. 
Finally 
they 
decimated 
themselves. 
Of 
the 
180 
Girondists 
who 
at 
the 
outset 
led 
the 
Convention 
140 
were 
killed 
or 
fled, 
and 
finally 
the 
most 
fanatical 
of 
the 
Terrorists, 
Robespierre, 
reigned 
alone 
over 
a 
terrified 
crowd 
of 
servile 
representatives. 


Yet 
it 
was 
among 
the 
five 
hundred 
members 
of 
the 
majority, 
uncertain 
and 
floating 
as 
it 
was, 
that 
the 
intelligence 
and 
experience 
were 
to 
be 
found. 
The 
technical 
committees 
to 
whom 
the 
useful 
work 
of 
the 
Convention 
was 
due 
were 
recruited 
from 
the 
Plain. 


More 
or 
less 
indifferent 
to 
politics, 
the 
members 
of 
the 
Plain 
were 
chiefly 



anxious 
that 
no 
one 
should 
pay 
particular 
attention 
to 
them. 
Shut 
up 
in 
their 
committees, 
they 
showed 
themselves 
as 
little 
as 
possible 
in 
the 
Assembly, 
which 
explains 
why 
the 
sessions 
of 
the 
Convention 
contained 
barely 
a 
third 
of 
the 
deputies. 


Unhappily, 
as 
often 
happens, 
these 
intelligent 
and 
honest 
men 
were 
completely 
devoid 
of 
character, 
and 
the 
fear 
which 
always 
dominated 
them 
made 
them 
vote 
for 
the 
worst 
of 
the 
measures 
introduced 
by 
their 
dreaded 
masters. 


The 
men 
of 
the 
Plain 
voted 
for 
everything 
they 
were 
ordered 
to 
vote 
for— 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
Revolutionary 
Tribunal, 
the 
Terror, 
&c. 
It 
was 
with 
their 
assistance 
that 
the 
Mountain 
crushed 
the 
Gironde, 
and 
Robespierre 
destroyed 
the 
Hebertists 
and 
Dantonists. 
Like 
all 
weak 
people, 
they 
followed 
the 
strong. 
The 
gentle 
philanthropists 
who 
composed 
the 
Plain, 
and 
constituted 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
Assembly, 
contributed, 
by 
their 
pusillanimity, 
to 
bring 
about 
the 
frightful 
excesses 
of 
the 
Convention. 


The 
psychological 
note 
always 
prevailing 
in 
the 
Convention 
was 
a 
horrible 
fear. 
It 
was 
more 
especially 
through 
fear 
that 
men 
cut 
off 
one 
another's 
heads, 
in 
the 
doubtful 
hope 
of 
keeping 
their 
own 
on 
their 
shoulders. 


Such 
a 
fear 
was, 
of 
course, 
very 
comprehensible. 
The 
unhappy 
deputies 
deliberated 
amid 
the 
hootings 
and 
vociferations 
of 
the 
tribunes. 
At 
every 
moment 
veritable 
savages, 
armed 
with 
pikes, 
invaded 
the 
Assembly, 
and 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
members 
no 
longer 
dared 
to 
attend 
the 
sessions. 
When 
by 
chance 
they 
did 
go 
it 
was 
only 
to 
vote 
in 
silence 
according 
to 
the 
orders 
of 
the 
Mountain, 
which 
was 
only 
a 
third 
as 
numerous. 


The 
fear 
which 
dominated 
the 
latter, 
although 
less 
visible, 
was 
just 
as 
profound. 
Men 
destroyed 
their 
enemies, 
not 
only 
because 
they 
were 
shallow 
fanatics, 
but 
because 
they 
were 
convinced 
that 
their 
own 
existence 
was 
threatened. 
The 
judges 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
Tribunals 
trembled 
no 
less. 
They 
would 
have 
willingly 
acquitted 
Danton, 
and 
the 
widow 
of 
Camille 
Desmoulins, 
and 
many 
others. 
They 
dared 
not. 


But 
it 
was 
above 
all 
when 
Robespierre 
became 
the 
sole 
master 
that 
the 
phantom 
of 
fear 
oppressed 
the 
Assembly. 
It 
has 
truly 
been 
said 
that 
a 
glance 
from 
the 
master 
made 
his 
colleagues 
shrink 
with 
fear. 
On 
their 
faces 
one 
read 
``the 
pallor 
of 
fear 
and 
the 
abandon 
of 
despair.'' 


All 
feared 
Robespierre 
and 
Robespierre 
feared 
all. 
It 
was 
because 
he 
feared 
conspiracies 
against 
him 
that 
he 
cut 
off 
men's 
heads, 
and 
it 
was 
also 
through 
fear 
that 
others 
allowed 
him 
to 
do 
so. 



The 
memoirs 
of 
members 
of 
the 
Convention 
show 
plainly 
what 
a 
horrible 
memory 
they 
retained 
of 
this 
gloomy 
period. 
Questioned 
twenty 
years 
later, 
says 
Taine, 
on 
the 
true 
aim 
and 
the 
intimate 
thoughts 
of 
the 
Committee 
of 
Public 
Safety, 
Barrere 
replied:— 


``We 
had 
only 
one 
feeling, 
that 
of 
self-preservation; 
only 
one 
desire, 
that 
of 
preserving 
our 
lives, 
which 
each 
of 
us 
believed 
to 
be 
threatened. 
You 
had 
your 
neighbour's 
head 
cut 
off 
so 
that 
your 
neighbour 
should 
not 
have 
you 
yourself 
guillotined.'' 


The 
history 
of 
the 
Convention 
constitutes 
one 
of 
the 
most 
striking 
examples 
that 
could 
be 
given 
of 
the 
influence 
of 
leaders 
and 
of 
fear 
upon 
an 
assembly. 


CHAPTER 
IV 


THE 
GOVERNMENT 
OF 
THE 
CONVENTION 


1. 
The 
activity 
of 
the 
Clubs 
and 
the 
Commune 
during 
the 
Convention. 
During 
the 
whole 
of 
its 
existence 
the 
Convention 
was 
governed 
by 
the 
leaders 
of 
the 
clubs 
and 
of 
the 
Commune. 
We 
have 
already 
seen 
what 
was 
their 
influence 
on 
the 
preceding 
Assemblies. 
It 
became 
overwhelming 
during 
the 
Convention. 
The 
history 
of 
this 
latter 
is 
in 
reality 
that 
of 
the 
clubs 
and 
the 
Commune 
which 
dominated 
it. 
They 
enslaved, 
not 
only 
the 
Convention, 
but 
also 
all 
France. 
Numerous 
little 
provincial 
clubs, 
directed 
by 
that 
of 
the 
capital, 
supervised 
magistrates, 
denounced 
suspects, 
and 
undertook 
the 
execution 
of 
all 
the 
revolutionary 
orders. 


When 
the 
clubs 
or 
the 
Commune 
had 
decided 
upon 
certain 
measures 
they 
had 
them 
voted 
by 
the 
Assembly 
then 
and 
there. 
If 
the 
Assembly 
resisted, 
they 
sent 
their 
armed 
delegations 
thither— 
that 
is, 
armed 
bands 
recruited 
from 
the 
scum 
of 
the 
populace. 
They 
conveyed 
injunctions 
which 
were 
always 
slavishly 
obeyed. 
The 
Commune 
was 
so 
sure 
of 
its 
strength 
that 
it 
even 
demanded 
of 
the 
Convention 
the 
immediate 
expulsion 
of 
deputies 
who 
displeased 
it. 


While 
the 
Convention 
was 
composed 
generally 
of 
educated 
men, 
the 
members 
of 
the 
Commune 
and 
the 
clubs 
comprised 
a 
majority 
of 
small 



shopkeepers, 
labourers, 
and 
artisans, 
incapable 
of 
personal 
opinions, 
and 
always 
guided 
by 
their 
leaders—Danton, 
Camille 
Desmoulins, 
Robespierre, 
&c. 


Of 
the 
two 
powers, 
clubs 
and 
insurrectionary 
Commune, 
the 
latter 
exercised 
the 
greater 
influence 
in 
Paris, 
because 
it 
had 
made 
for 
itself 
a 
revolutionary 
army. 
It 
held 
under 
its 
orders 
forty-eight 
committees 
of 
National 
Guards, 
who 
asked 
nothing 
more 
than 
to 
kill, 
sack, 
and, 
above 
all, 
plunder. 


The 
tyranny 
with 
which 
the 
Commune 
crushed 
Paris 
was 
frightful. 
For 
example, 
it 
delegated 
to 
a 
certain 
cobbler, 
Chalandon 
by 
name, 
the 
right 
of 
surveillance 
over 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
capital—a 
right 
implying 
the 
power 
to 
send 
to 
the 
Revolutionary 
Tribunal, 
and 
therefore 
to 
the 
guillotine, 
all 
those 
whom 
he 
suspected. 
Certain 
streets 
were 
thus 
almost 
depopulated 
by 
him. 


The 
Convention 
struggled 
feebly 
against 
the 
Commune 
at 
the 
outset, 
but 
did 
not 
prolong 
its 
resistance. 
The 
culminating 
point 
of 
the 
conflict 
occurred 
when 
the 
Convention 
wished 
to 
arrest 
Hebert, 
the 
friend 
of 
the 
Commune, 
and 
the 
latter 
sent 
armed 
bands 
who 
threatened 
the 
Assembly 
and 
demanded 
the 
expulsion 
of 
the 
Girondists 
who 
had 
provoked 
the 
measure. 
Upon 
the 
Convention 
refusing 
the 
Commune 
besieged 
it 
on 
June 
2, 
1798, 
by 
means 
of 
its 
revolutionary 
army, 
which 
was 
under 
the 
orders 
of 
Hanriot. 
Terrified, 
the 
Assembly 
gave 
up 
twenty-seven 
of 
its 
members. 
The 
Commune 
immediately 
sent 
a 
delegation 
ironically 
to 
felicitate 
it 
upon 
its 
obedience. 


After 
the 
fall 
of 
the 
Girondists 
the 
Convention 
submitted 
itself 
completely 
to 
the 
injunctions 
of 
the 
omnipotent 
Commune. 
The 
latter 
decreed 
the 
levy 
of 
a 
revolutionary 
army, 
to 
be 
accompanied 
by 
a 
tribunal 
and 
a 
guillotine, 
which 
was 
to 
traverse 
the 
whole 
of 
France 
in 
order 
to 
execute 
suspects. 


Only 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
its 
existence, 
after 
the 
fall 
of 
Robespierre, 
did 
the 
Convention 
contrive 
to 
escape 
from 
the 
yoke 
of 
the 
Jacobins 
and 
the 
Commune. 
It 
closed 
the 
Jacobin 
club 
and 
guillotined 
its 
leading 
members. 


Despite 
such 
sanctions 
the 
leaders 
still 
continued 
to 
excite 
the 
populace 
and 
hurl 
it 
against 
the 
Convention. 
In 
Germinal 
and 
Prairial 
it 
underwent 
regular 
sieges. 
Armed 
delegations 
even 
succeeded 
in 
forcing 
the 
Convention 
to 
vote 
the 
re-establishment 
of 
the 
Commune 
and 
the 
convocation 
of 
a 
new 
Assembly, 
a 
measure 
which 
the 
Convention 
hastened 
to 
annul 
the 
moment 
the 
insurgents 
had 
withdrawn. 
Ashamed 
of 
its 
fear, 
it 
sent 
for 
regiments 
which 
disarmed 
the 
faubourgs 
and 
made 
nearly 
ten 
thousand 
arrests. 
Twenty-
six 
leaders 
of 
the 
movement 
were 
put 
to 
death, 
and 
six 
deputies 
who 
were 



concerned 
in 
the 
riot 
were 
guillotined. 


But 
the 
Convention 
did 
not 
resist 
to 
led 
by 
the 
clubs 
and 
the 
Commune 
it 
ob 
and 
voted 
its 
decrees 
without 
discussion
