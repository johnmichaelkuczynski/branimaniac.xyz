I. GENERAL EVOLUTIONARY THEORY
1.	All species of organic beings have descended from a few primordial forms, or possibly from one single ancestral form.
2.	Natural selection is the principal, though not exclusive, means of modification in the organic world.

4.	The struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high geometrical rate of increase common to all organic beings.
5.	Slight modifications that confer even marginal advantage in the struggle for life will tend to be preserved and accumulated.
6.	Species are not immutable; they undergo gradual transformation over vast periods of time.
7.	The extinction of old forms and the production of new improved forms are intimately connected.
8.	Transitional forms between major groups must have existed, though their rarity in the fossil record is explained by the imperfection of geological preservation.
9.	Organs of extreme perfection, such as the eye, can be explained by gradual accumulation of small improvements through natural selection.
