    "premise": "marriage|provides|discipline|hostages|fortune|anchor",
    "conclusion": "Marriage provides discipline and hostages to fortune that anchor a man's ambitions within the bounds of prudence; unmarried men may attempt great enterprises more freely, but married men execute them more steadily, for they have cause to care about consequences beyond their own mortality"

    "premise": "good|wife|serves|second|self|counsel",
    "conclusion": "A good wife serves as a second self for counsel and comfort, remedying the defect of solitary judgment; she may perfect a man's character where his own self-knowledge fails, provided she be chosen for virtue and compatibility rather than wealth or beauty alone"

    "premise": "marriage|moderates|excessive|ambition|providing|domestic",
    "conclusion": "Marriage moderates excessive ambition by providing domestic satisfactions that compete with public honors; a man with wife and children has already achieved a form of immortality through posterity, reducing the desperate hunger for fame that drives unmarried men to recklessness"

    "premise": "wife|good|understanding|serves|perpetual|mirror",
    "conclusion": "A wife of good understanding serves as a perpetual mirror showing a man his faults more faithfully than any friend dares; she witnesses his private conduct where reputation cannot compel virtue, and thus either confirms his character or exposes its hollowness"

    "premise": "statesman|subordinate|private|affections|public|duty",
    "conclusion": "A statesman must subordinate private affections to public duty without destroying them entirely; he should choose a wife who understands that her husband belongs first to the commonwealth, taking his absences and preoccupations as the price of honor rather than neglect"

    "topic": "Bachelorhood and Scholarship",
    "premise": "unmarried|scholar|risks|losing|contact|common",

    "topic": "Bachelorhood and Social Pressure",
    "premise": "pressure|continue|name|estate|operates|powerfully",
    "conclusion": "The pressure to continue one's name and estate operates powerfully on men of property; to die without heirs feels like a kind of extinction, and society reinforces this by treating unmarried men as incomplete or suspect in their attachments"

    "topic": "State Power and Integrity",
    "premise": "positions|state|power|maintain|integrity|keeping",
    "conclusion": "Those in positions of state power maintain integrity by keeping some counselors who speak unpleasant truths and rewarding frankness rather than punishing it; integrity requires accurate information, which only flows to those who demonstrate they can receive unwelcome news without retaliation"

    "id": 4123,
    "topic": "State Power and Integrity",
    "premise": "power|maintain|integrity|remembering|held|trust",

    "topic": "State Power and Character",
    "premise": "amplification|character|power|asymmetric|vices|grow",
    "conclusion": "The amplification of character through power is asymmetric: vices grow faster than virtues under the nourishment of power because virtue requires effort while vice merely requires permission, and power removes the external restraints that previously checked bad impulses"

    "topic": "State Power and Centralization",
    "premise": "execution|requires|unity|state|multiple|equal",
    "conclusion": "Execution requires unity; a state with multiple equal heads proceeds slowly and decides nothing, while enemies move swiftly against its divisions; one ruler with wise counsel executes policy more effectively than any committee"

    "topic": "State Power and Learning",
    "premise": "state|power|either|advance|retard|learning",
    "conclusion": "State power can either advance or retard learning depending on the prince's disposition; a learned king who patronizes universities, funds expeditions, and protects inquirers multiplies the progress of knowledge beyond what private means could achieve"

    "premise": "human|understanding|clear|mirror|distorting|mingles",
    "conclusion": "The human understanding is not a clear mirror but a distorting one; it mingles its own nature with the nature of things, bending observations to fit prior beliefs; unless we deliberately correct for these idols, we study our own minds rather than external reality"

    "topic": "Scientific Method and Classification",
    "premise": "begin|comprehensive|collection|attempting|classification|premature",

    "topic": "Misconceptions About Science",
    "premise": "superstition|attributes|effects|causes|based|superficial",
    "conclusion": "Superstition attributes effects to causes based on superficial resemblance or temporal coincidence rather than demonstrated connection; it mistakes correlation for causation and symbol for substance, as when astrologers read destinies in planetary positions"

    "premise": "superstitious|mind|remembers|hits|forgets|misses",

    "premise": "reverence|antiquity|produces|intellectual|servitude|repeat",
    "conclusion": "Reverence for antiquity produces intellectual servitude\u2014men repeat Aristotle's errors for two thousand years rather than open their eyes to contradicting evidence; the ancients were the youth of knowledge, not its maturity; we are the true ancients, enriched by their experience plus our own"

    "id": 4143,
    "topic": "Ancient Authorities and Science",
    "premise": "ancient|authorities|particularly|misleading|errors|come",
    "conclusion": "Ancient authorities are particularly misleading because their errors come dressed in systematic elegance; a beautiful theory persists longer than an ugly truth, and the coherence of Aristotelian philosophy gives it persuasive power independent of its accuracy"

    "premise": "mind|naturally|leaps|instances|universal|axioms",
    "conclusion": "The mind naturally leaps from a few instances to universal axioms, then deduces everything else from these premature conclusions; but axioms formed hastily rarely fit new cases, and rather than revise the axiom, men distort the evidence to preserve their system"

    "premise": "hasty|generalization|produces|illusion|understanding|prevents",

    "premise": "fixed|number|observations|suffices|question|quality",

    "topic": "Use of Spies",
    "premise": "spies|watch|specific|threats|rather|general",
