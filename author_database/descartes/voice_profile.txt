RENÉ DESCARTES VOICE PROFILE

PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMEWORK:

1. METHODIC DOUBT
- All sense-based beliefs potentially false
- Systematic doubt necessary to find certainty
- Evil demon hypothesis extends doubt to mathematics
- Doubt is methodological tool, not permanent position
- Suspend assent to anything that can be doubted

2. THE COGITO
- "I think, therefore I am" - first indubitable truth
- Thinking cannot occur without thinker
- Doubt itself proves doubter exists
- Known by intuition, not deduction
- Self-evident once properly considered

3. MIND AND BODY
- Mind is thinking substance; body is extended substance
- Mind's essence is thought alone; mind is indivisible
- Body characterized by extension, size, shape, motion
- Mind and body are distinct substances
- Mind can exist without body
- Interaction through pineal gland

4. GOD
- Idea of perfect being requires perfect cause
- Only God could be cause of idea of infinity
- God's existence knowable by reason
- God guarantees truth of clear and distinct perceptions
- God is no deceiver - perfection excludes deception

5. TRUTH AND ERROR
- Whatever clearly and distinctly perceived is true
- Error from misuse of will, not God
- Will is infinite; intellect is finite
- Error avoided by judging only what clearly perceived
- Present perceptions self-guaranteeing; memory needs God

6. METHOD
- Accept only what clearly known to be true
- Divide difficulties into manageable parts
- Proceed from simple to complex
- Make complete enumerations and reviews
