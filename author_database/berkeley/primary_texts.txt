KEY EXCERPTS & PASSAGES
=========================================

**FROM PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE**:

**On Esse Est Percipi** (Section 3):
"That neither our thoughts, nor passions, nor ideas formed by the imagination, exist without the mind is what everybody will allow. And to me it seems no less evident that the various sensations or ideas imprinted on the Sense, however blended or combined together (that is, whatever objects they compose), cannot exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving them."

**Against Abstract Matter** (Section 5):
"If we thoroughly examine this tenet of an extended moveable substance existing without the mind, we shall perhaps discover it to involve a manifest contradiction. For what are the aforementioned objects but the things we perceive by sense? And what do we perceive besides our own ideas or sensations? And is it not plainly repugnant that any one of these, or any combination of them, should exist unperceived?"

**On God's Role** (Section 6):
"There is therefore some other Will or Spirit that produces them... There is an omnipresent eternal Mind, which knows and comprehends all things, and exhibits them to our view in such a manner, and according to such rules, as he himself hath ordained."

**FROM THREE DIALOGUES**:

**Philonous's Challenge** (First Dialogue):
"Can you frame to yourself the idea of a thing existing unperceived? Tell me if this be not as great a contradiction as to talk of a man walking with his legs off? Can you conceive it possible that a thing should exist and yet not be perceived?"

**On Common Sense** (Third Dialogue):
"I am of a vulgar cast, simple enough to believe my senses, and leave things as I find them. To be plain, it is my opinion that the real things are those very things I see and feel, and perceive by my senses. These I know; and finding they answer all the necessities and purposes of life, have no reason to be solicitous about any other unknown beings."

**On God's Perception** (Third Dialogue):
"When therefore supposing all the world to be annihilated besides my own body, I say there still remains pure Space, thereby nothing else is meant but only that I conceive it possible for the limbs of my body to be moved on all sides without the least resistance, but if that, too, were annihilated then there could be no motion, and consequently no Space."

=========================================
CORE ARGUMENTS
=========================================

**ARGUMENT AGAINST MATERIAL SUBSTANCE**:
1. We perceive only ideas (sensible qualities)
2. Ideas cannot exist outside minds
3. Therefore, objects (which = collections of ideas) cannot exist outside minds
4. Matter (as existing outside all minds) is incoherent
5. Conclusion: Immaterialism is true

**ARGUMENT FROM INCONCEIVABILITY**:
1. Try to conceive matter existing unperceived
2. To conceive something is to have an idea of it
3. To have an idea of X is to perceive X
4. Therefore, conceiving unperceived matter = perceiving unperceived thing
5. This is contradictory
6. Therefore, matter existing unperceived is inconceivable = impossible

**ARGUMENT AGAINST ABSTRACT IDEAS**:
1. Locke says we form abstract general ideas (e.g., "triangle in general")
2. But every idea is particular
3. Cannot imagine triangle that's neither equilateral nor isosceles nor scalene yet all
4. We use particulars to represent classes
5. Abstract ideas are impossible
6. Abstract matter depends on abstract ideas
7. Therefore, abstract matter is impossible

**ARGUMENT FOR GOD FROM CONTINUITY**:
1. Objects continue existing when I don't perceive them
2. To exist is to be perceived (esse est percipi)
3. Therefore, something perceives them continuously
4. This cannot be any finite mind
5. Therefore, infinite mind (God) perceives them
6. Conclusion: God exists and sustains nature

DIALOGUE EXCERPTS (HYLAS & PHILONOUS)
=========================================

**Opening of First Dialogue**:

PHILONOUS: Good morning, Hylas. I did not expect to find you abroad so early.

HYLAS: It is indeed something unusual; but my thoughts were so taken up with a subject I was discussing last night that, finding I could not sleep, I resolved to rise and take a turn in the garden.

PHILONOUS: It happened well, to let you see what innocent and agreeable pleasures you lose every morning. Can there be a pleasanter time of the day or a more delightful season of the year?

[Proceeds to discuss perception and reality through garden observations]

**Hylas Trapped by Questions**:

PHILONOUS: In short, do the colours exist without the mind or no?

HYLAS: I do not mean they exist without the mind in an unthinking substance, but that they exist in the mind of some superior spirit that supports and keeps them up.

PHILONOUS: How! is there any thing perceived by sense which does not exist in the mind?

HYLAS: Upon a nice observation, I do not think there is.

[Hylas gradually concedes ground]

**Final Conversion**:

HYLAS: I think I must confess I have all along adhered to Matter from a prejudice, but it is over... Immaterialism seems to me, on the contrary, more reasonable than any other system.
