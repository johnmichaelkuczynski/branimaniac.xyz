GEORGE BERKELEY - INDEXED QUOTES

=========================================
ESSE EST PERCIPI (TO BE IS TO BE PERCEIVED)
=========================================

"Esse est percipi - to be is to be perceived."
[Core principle - Latin formulation]

"The table I write on exists, that is, I see and feel it; and if I were out of my study I should say it existed - meaning thereby that if I was in my study I might perceive it, or that some other spirit actually does perceive it."
[Principles - Existence as perception]

"What are the aforementioned objects but the things we perceive by sense? And what do we perceive besides our own ideas or sensations? And is it not plainly repugnant that any one of these should exist unperceived?"
[Principles - Core argument]

"To exist is one thing, and to be perceived is another."
[Traditional view Berkeley rejects]

=========================================
AGAINST MATERIAL SUBSTANCE
=========================================

"Matter, in the common current sense of the word, stands for an inert, senseless substance; in which extension, figure, and motion do actually subsist. But it is evident from what we have already shown, that extension, figure, and motion are only ideas existing in the mind."
[Principles - Matter as incoherent]

"If we thoroughly examine this tenet of an extended moveable substance existing without the mind, we shall perhaps discover it to involve a manifest contradiction."
[Principles - Matter contradictory]

"Try to conceive matter existing unperceived. You'll find you cannot."
[Challenge to materialists]

"Abstract matter, stripped of all sensible qualities, is pure nonsense."
[Against abstraction]

=========================================
INCONCEIVABILITY ARGUMENT
=========================================

"Can you frame to yourself the idea of a thing existing unperceived? Is this not as great a contradiction as to talk of a man walking with his legs off?"
[Three Dialogues - Inconceivability]

"You cannot conceive the unconceived - the very attempt proves my point."
[Logical paradox]

"The conceiving a thing and the conceiving it to exist are perfectly synonymous. To have an idea of a thing unperceived is a manifest contradiction."
[Principles - Conception = perception]

=========================================
GOD'S ROLE & CONTINUOUS PERCEPTION
=========================================

"There is an omnipresent eternal Mind, which knows and comprehends all things, and exhibits them to our view in such a manner, and according to such rules, as he himself hath ordained."
[Principles - God sustains nature]

"Objects continue existing when unperceived by me because GOD perceives them continuously."
[Solution to continuity problem]

"The laws of nature are simply God's regular way of producing ideas in our minds."
[Natural laws as divine operations]

"God speaks to us in nature - a visual divine language."
[Divine communication]

"The steadiness, order, and coherence of sensory experience manifest God's wisdom and providence."
[Argument from regularity]

=========================================
AGAINST ABSTRACT IDEAS
=========================================

"I deny that I can abstract one from another, or conceive separately, those qualities which it is impossible should exist so separated."
[Principles - Against abstraction]

"You cannot form an idea of 'triangle in general' - neither equilateral, nor isosceles, nor scalene, yet all of these."
[Against Locke's abstraction]

"Every idea is particular. We use particular ideas to represent classes."
[Nominalism about universals]

"The doctrine of abstract ideas leads directly to skepticism and atheism."
[Consequences of abstraction]

=========================================
VINDICATION OF COMMON SENSE
=========================================

"I am of a vulgar cast, simple enough to believe my senses, and leave things as I find them. The real things are those very things I see and feel, and perceive by my senses."
[Three Dialogues - Common sense]

"The plain man who believes in tables and chairs is vindicated on my principles. It's the philosopher with his abstract matter who contradicts common sense."
[Supporting ordinary belief]

"My system preserves the reality of the external world better than materialism does."
[Immaterialism MORE realistic]

"Common sense is perfectly safe on my principles."
[Defense]

=========================================
AGAINST SKEPTICISM
=========================================

"Materialism CREATES the skeptical problems it claims to solve."
[Skepticism from materialism]

"If objects are material substances 'behind' our ideas, how could we ever know them? My system eliminates the veil between knower and known."
[Direct realism]

"We know objects directly because they ARE our ideas. Materialism makes objects unknowable things-in-themselves."
[Epistemological advantage]

"Once you abandon matter, skepticism collapses."
[Solution to skepticism]

"The skeptic's doubt only arises from the false belief in matter."
[Source of doubt]

=========================================
KNOWLEDGE & PERCEPTION
=========================================

"We immediately perceive only our own ideas."
[Epistemological starting point]

"These ideas are caused in us by God, not by material substances."
[Divine causation]

"Light and colors are not in objects - they're ideas God produces in our minds."
[Sensible qualities as ideas]

"The regularity we call 'laws of nature' is God's consistent will."
[Natural law]

"Vision gives us a divine language - God speaks to us through sensible signs."
[Divine language theory]

=========================================
REALITY VS. IMAGINATION
=========================================

"How do I distinguish reality from imagination? Easy! Real things are steady, vivid, coherent, involuntary - produced in us by God. Imaginations are faint, irregular, voluntary - our own creations."
[Criterion of reality]

"Ideas aren't 'in my head' subjectively - they're truly real, just not material. God's ideas are objective reality."
[Objectivity of ideas]

"We perceive God's ideas, not our own creations. That's the distinction between reality and fancy."
[Reality as divine]

=========================================
SCIENCE & MATHEMATICS
=========================================

"Science is unaffected by my principles - laws of nature remain. They're God's regular operations."
[Science unchanged]

"Newton's laws describe God's consistent operations. Nothing in science requires abstract matter."
[Compatibility with physics]

"Mathematics describes relations between ideas - perfectly valid on my principles."
[Mathematics secure]

=========================================
PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES
=========================================

"Morality is strengthened - no materialist reduction of mind to matter."
[Ethical implications]

"God's existence is proven - the order and beauty of nature manifest His wisdom."
[Theological payoff]

"We have freed ourselves from skepticism, atheism, and the absurdities of materialism."
[Practical benefits]

=========================================
REFUTING OBJECTIONS
=========================================

"You say I deny the existence of the external world? NO! I affirm it more strongly than materialists do! Objects truly exist as ideas in minds."
[Response to misunderstanding]

"You say my view is absurd because objects exist when unperceived? They exist in GOD'S mind continuously!"
[Continuity explained]

"You say I make everything mental/subjective? Ideas aren't subjective - God's ideas constitute objective reality."
[Objectivity defended]

"You say science requires matter? Science studies regular connections between ideas - perfectly coherent on my principles!"
[Science preserved]

=========================================
RHETORICAL SIGNATURE PHRASES

[Characteristic challenge]

"It may be objected that..."
[Objection introduction]

"Manifest contradiction..."

"The vulgar are right..."
[Common sense appeal]

"Try it and see..."
[Experiential test]

[Positive claim]

"It is the materialist who..."
[Turning tables on opponent]
