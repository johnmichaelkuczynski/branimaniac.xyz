GEORGE BERKELEY - IMMATERIALIST FRAMEWORK

=========================================
FUNDAMENTAL ONTOLOGY
=========================================

**TWO KINDS OF EXISTENCE**:

**1. MINDS (SPIRITS)**:
- Active substances
- Can perceive, will, think
- Not composed of ideas
- Simple, indivisible, immaterial
- Subjects, never objects
- I know myself by "notion," not idea

**2. IDEAS**:
- Passive objects of perception
- Exist only in minds
- Cannot exist unperceived
- Sensible qualities (colors, sounds, tastes, textures, etc.)
- Objects = collections of ideas
- Known directly through perception

**NOTHING ELSE EXISTS**:
- No "material substance"
- No "matter" existing independently of minds
- Two categories exhaust reality: minds and their ideas

=========================================
ESSE EST PERCIPI (CORE PRINCIPLE)
=========================================

**FOR IDEAS: TO BE IS TO BE PERCEIVED**

**What This Means**:
- Ideas have no existence except when perceived
- Table = collection of ideas (brown color, hard texture, rectangular shape, etc.)
- These ideas exist only as perceived
- Therefore table exists only as perceived

**What This DOESN'T Mean**:
- ❌ Table disappears when I look away
- ❌ Reality is "all in my head"
- ❌ External world doesn't exist
- ❌ Everything is subjective

**The Solution**:
- God perceives all things continuously
- Objects persist in God's mind
- Stability of nature = God's continuous perception
- Objectivity = ideas in God's mind vs. my private imaginings

=========================================
AGAINST MATERIAL SUBSTANCE
=========================================

**WHAT MATERIALISTS CLAIM**:
- Material substance exists independently of all minds
- It "supports" or "underlies" sensible qualities
- We perceive qualities, infer substance
- Substance is extended, figured, in motion

**BERKELEY'S REFUTATION**:

**Argument 1: Inconceivability**
- Try to conceive matter existing unperceived
- To conceive X is to have idea of X
- To have idea of X is to perceive X
- Therefore: conceiving unperceived matter = perceiving unperceived thing
- This is contradictory
- Therefore: unperceived matter is inconceivable = impossible

**Argument 2: Abstract Matter is Nonsense**
- Materialists say: matter exists stripped of all sensible qualities
- Try to conceive this: not colored, not textured, not sounding, etc.
- You cannot
- Remove all qualities → remove the thing itself
- "Abstract matter" = empty concept

**Argument 3: Ideas Cannot Resemble Non-Ideas**
- Materialists say: our ideas resemble material things
- But idea can only resemble another idea
- Nothing unlike an idea can be like an idea
- Therefore: material things (if not ideas) cannot resemble our ideas
- Therefore: we could never know them

**Argument 4: Support is Unintelligible**
- Materialists say: substance "supports" qualities
- What does "support" mean here?
- Not physical support (like pillar supports roof)
- Some mysterious metaphysical support?
- This is empty verbiage, no clear meaning

=========================================
AGAINST ABSTRACT IDEAS
=========================================

**LOCKE'S THEORY** (Berkeley's target):
- Mind forms abstract general ideas
- "Triangle in general" - neither equilateral, nor isosceles, nor scalene, yet all
- "Man in general" - neither tall nor short, neither European nor African, yet all

**BERKELEY'S REFUTATION**:
- Try to form these ideas
- You cannot
- Every idea is particular
- You can imagine particular triangle, then use it to represent all triangles
- But cannot imagine "triangle in general" as Locke describes
- Abstract ideas are impossible

**CONSEQUENCES**:
- Abstract matter depends on abstract ideas
- If abstract ideas impossible, abstract matter impossible
- Materialism collapses

**NOMINALISM**:
- General terms do not stand for abstract ideas
- They stand for classes of particulars
- Word "triangle" represents all particular triangles
- No abstract idea of triangle needed

=========================================
GOD'S ROLE IN BERKELEY'S SYSTEM
=========================================

**1. CONTINUOUS PERCEIVER**:
- Objects continue existing when no finite mind perceives them
- Esse est percipi still holds
- Therefore: infinite mind (God) perceives them continuously
- God's perception sustains nature

**2. CAUSE OF IDEAS**:
- I do not produce my sensory ideas voluntarily
- They are impressed upon me
- By what? Not by matter (doesn't exist)
- Therefore: by God
- God causes ideas in my mind according to regular laws

**3. GUARANTOR OF NATURAL ORDER**:
- Laws of nature = God's regular way of operating
- Coherence of experience = God's consistency
- Predictability of nature = divine reliability
- Science studies God's patterns of idea-production

**4. DISTINCTION BETWEEN REALITY AND IMAGINATION**:
- **Real things**: God's ideas
  - Vivid, strong, distinct
  - Involuntary (I cannot change them at will)
  - Coherent with each other
  - Stable, orderly, regular
- **Imaginations**: My own ideas
  - Faint, weak, irregular
  - Voluntary (I control them)
  - Incoherent, changeable
  - Depend on my will

**5. DIVINE LANGUAGE**:
- God speaks to us through sensory experience
- Visual perception = divine signs
- Nature = God's continuous communication
- Learning to perceive = learning God's language

=========================================
KNOWLEDGE & PERCEPTION
=========================================

**WHAT WE KNOW DIRECTLY**:
- Our own ideas
- Not representations of external things
- The ideas ARE the things
- No "veil of perception"

**DIRECT REALISM**:
- Berkeley is a direct realist
- We perceive objects directly (they are our ideas)
- No inference needed from ideas to objects
- Materialism makes perception indirect

**NO SKEPTICAL GAP**:
- Materialism: ideas here, objects there (unknowable)
- Berkeley: ideas = objects (directly known)
- Skepticism solved by identifying ideas with objects

**NOTIONS OF MINDS**:
- We don't have ideas of minds (including our own)
- We have "notions" of minds
- Different kind of knowledge (by reflection, not perception)
- Know our own mind by its operations

=========================================
LAWS OF NATURE
=========================================

**TRADITIONAL VIEW**:
- Laws = causal powers of matter
- Matter causes phenomena
- Laws inhere in material substances

**BERKELEY'S VIEW**:
- Laws = regular patterns of God's idea-production
- Not causal powers, but descriptive regularities
- God produces ideas in us according to consistent patterns
- "Fire causes pain" means: God regularly produces pain-idea after fire-idea

**SCIENTIFIC PRACTICE UNCHANGED**:
- Scientists still discover regularities
- Make predictions based on patterns
- Mathematics describes relations
- Only metaphysical interpretation changes: God's patterns, not matter's powers

=========================================
OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES
=========================================

**OBJECTION**: "Your view denies external reality!"

**RESPONSE**:
NO! I affirm external reality more strongly than materialists.
- Objects truly exist (as ideas in God's mind)
- Materialists make objects unknowable things-in-themselves
- I make objects directly knowable
- Who truly "denies" external reality?

---

**OBJECTION**: "Objects exist when no one perceives them!"

**RESPONSE**:
God perceives them.
- Esse est percipi doesn't require MY perception
- Requires SOME perception
- God is omnipresent, omniscient perceiver
- Objects exist continuously in divine mind

---

**OBJECTION**: "Everything becomes subjective!"

**RESPONSE**:
God's ideas are objective.
- Distinction: God's ideas vs. my imaginations
- God's ideas = reality (objective, stable, involuntary)
- My imaginations = fancy (subjective, changeable, voluntary)
- Objectivity preserved

---

**OBJECTION**: "Science requires matter!"

**RESPONSE**:
Science requires regular patterns, not matter.
- Laws of nature = God's regular operations
- Scientists study these patterns
- Predictions still work
- Mathematics still valid
- Only metaphysics changes

---

**OBJECTION**: "Creation account - God created matter!"

**RESPONSE**:
God created by producing ideas in finite minds.
- Genesis says God created light, earth, etc.
- These are sensible things = ideas
- God created by willing ideas to exist
- No matter needed

=========================================
PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES
=========================================

**FOR COMMON SENSE**:
- Ordinary beliefs vindicated
- Tables, chairs, trees exist (as ideas)
- Plain man is right
- Philosopher with abstract matter is wrong

**FOR SCIENCE**:
- Scientific practice unchanged
- Laws of nature remain
- Mathematics valid
- Only interpretation changes

**FOR MORALITY**:
- Minds (souls) truly exist
- Not reducible to matter
- Free will preserved (minds are active)
- Moral responsibility intact

**FOR RELIGION**:
- God's existence proven (necessary for nature's continuity)
- Divine providence shown (in nature's order)
- Atheism refuted (no materialism to ground it)
- Natural theology vindicated

**FOR EPISTEMOLOGY**:
- Skepticism defeated (no veil of perception)
- Direct knowledge of world
- Certainty possible
- Knowledge secured

=========================================
COMMON MISUNDERSTANDINGS
=========================================

**MISTAKE 1**: "Berkeley denies external world exists"
- NO! He affirms it - objects ARE ideas, truly existing

**MISTAKE 2**: "Berkeley says everything is in my mind"
- NO! Most ideas are in GOD'S mind - that's objective reality

**MISTAKE 3**: "Berkeley's idealism is like modern idealism"
- NO! He's an immaterialist, not a Kantian/Hegelian idealist

**MISTAKE 4**: "If a tree falls in forest with no one around, it makes no sound"
- NO! God hears it - God is always around

**MISTAKE 5**: "Berkeley can't distinguish reality from dreams"
- NO! Clear criterion - God's ideas (vivid, coherent, involuntary) vs. imaginations (faint, irregular, voluntary)
