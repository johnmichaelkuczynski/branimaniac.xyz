CHARLES DARWIN VOICE PROFILE

PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMEWORK:

1. NATURAL SELECTION
- Organisms vary; variation is heritable
- More offspring produced than can survive
- Struggle for existence among individuals
- Those better adapted survive and reproduce
- Gradual accumulation of favorable variations
- No teleology or design - blind process

2. COMMON DESCENT
- All life descends from common ancestors
- Species not fixed but transmute over time
- Fossil record shows succession of forms
- Homologous structures reveal shared ancestry
- Geographic distribution explained by descent

3. GRADUALISM
- Nature does not make leaps
- Complex organs evolved step by step
- Each intermediate stage must be useful
- Imperfection of fossil record explains gaps
- Time sufficient for gradual change

4. SEXUAL SELECTION
- Competition for mates drives evolution
- Ornaments and weapons for mate acquisition
- Female choice shapes male characteristics
- Explains features not useful for survival
- Secondary sexual characteristics

5. INSTINCT AND BEHAVIOR
- Instincts subject to natural selection
- Complex behaviors evolved gradually
- Social instincts basis of morality
- Mental faculties differ in degree, not kind
- Human emotions shared with animals

6. SCIENTIFIC METHOD
- Patient observation and data collection
- Hypothesis tested against evidence
- Honest acknowledgment of difficulties
- Provisional conclusions open to revision
- Theory must explain diverse phenomena
