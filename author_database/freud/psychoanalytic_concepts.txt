SIGMUND FREUD - PSYCHOANALYTIC CONCEPTS REFERENCE

=========================================
TOPOGRAPHICAL MODEL (EARLY)
=========================================

**THREE REGIONS OF MIND**:

**CONSCIOUS**:
- Currently aware thoughts, perceptions, feelings
- Small portion of total mental life
- Accessible to introspection
- "Tip of the iceberg"

**PRECONSCIOUS**:
- Not currently conscious but easily accessible
- Memories you can recall when needed
- Bridge between conscious and unconscious
- Can become conscious through attention

**UNCONSCIOUS**:
- Largest portion of mental life
- Not accessible to introspection directly
- Contains repressed wishes, memories, impulses
- Operates by different logic (primary process)
- Revealed through dreams, slips, symptoms, free association

**CHARACTERISTICS OF UNCONSCIOUS**:
- No time (past is present)
- No negation (can't say "no")
- No contradiction (opposites coexist)
- No doubt or certainty
- Primary process thinking (condensation, displacement)
- Governed by pleasure principle

=========================================
STRUCTURAL MODEL (LATER)
=========================================

**THREE STRUCTURES OF PSYCHE**:

**ID** ("Es" - the It):
- Unconscious reservoir of psychic energy (libido)
- Present from birth
- Operates on **pleasure principle** (immediate gratification)
- No logic, no time, no values, no morality
- Source of all psychic energy
- Drives: sexual (Eros) and aggressive (Thanatos)
- Impersonal force ("it drives me")

**EGO** ("Ich" - the I):
- Mediates between id, superego, and reality
- Operates on **reality principle** (delayed gratification)
- Rational, adaptive, problem-solving
- Develops from id through contact with external world
- Manages defense mechanisms
- "The ego is first and foremost a bodily ego"
- Under constant siege from three fronts: id, superego, reality

**SUPEREGO** ("Über-Ich" - Over-I):
- Internalized parental/social prohibitions and ideals
- Two components:
  - **Conscience**: punitive, guilt-inducing
  - **Ego-ideal**: aspirational, what we should be
- Mostly unconscious
- "Heir to the Oedipus complex" (formed through Oedipal resolution)
- Can be excessively harsh (producing neurosis)
- Source of moral anxiety (guilt, shame)

**CONFLICTS**:
- Neurosis = conflict between structures
- Psychosis = ego overwhelmed, loses contact with reality
- Normal functioning = ego successfully mediates
- Therapy = strengthening ego: "Where id was, there ego shall be"

=========================================
PSYCHOSEXUAL DEVELOPMENT STAGES
=========================================

**ORAL STAGE** (0-18 months):

**Erogenous Zone**: Mouth
**Key Activities**: Sucking, biting, oral incorporation
**Pleasure Source**: Nursing, oral stimulation
**Conflicts**: Weaning
**Fixation Results**:
- Oral-passive: dependent, gullible, follower
- Oral-aggressive: sarcastic, argumentative, hostile
**Adult Manifestations**: Smoking, overeating, nail-biting, excessive talking

---

**ANAL STAGE** (18 months - 3 years):

**Erogenous Zone**: Anus
**Key Activities**: Retention and expulsion of feces
**Pleasure Source**: Bowel control
**Conflicts**: Toilet training (first major control battle with parents)
**Fixation Results**:
- Anal-retentive: obsessive, orderly, stubborn, stingy
- Anal-expulsive: messy, disorganized, defiant
**Adult Manifestations**: Perfectionism, hoarding, or opposite (disorder, waste)

---

**PHALLIC STAGE** (3-6 years):

**Erogenous Zone**: Genitals
**Key Activities**: Masturbation, genital exploration
**Major Drama**: **OEDIPUS COMPLEX** (boys) / **ELECTRA COMPLEX** (girls)

**For Boys**:
1. Desires mother sexually
2. Sees father as rival
3. **Castration anxiety** (fears father will castrate him)
4. Resolves by identifying with father
5. Represses incestuous wish
6. Forms superego through identification

**For Girls**:
1. Discovers she lacks penis (**penis envy**)
2. Blames mother for this "castration"
3. Turns to father, desires his penis/baby
4. Competing with mother
5. Resolves (less completely than boys) through identification with mother

**Fixation Results**: Vanity, recklessness, or sexual dysfunction
**Failure to Resolve**: Core of neurosis

---

**LATENCY** (6 years - puberty):

**Characteristics**:
- Sexual drives repressed
- Energy redirected (sublimated) into:
  - School learning
  - Hobbies
  - Friendships (same-sex)
  - Sports, skills
- Relatively calm period
- Not a psychosexual stage proper (no new erogenous zone)

---

**GENITAL STAGE** (Puberty onward):

**Characteristics**:
- Mature sexuality emerges
- Integration of earlier stages
- Capacity for genuine love (not just narcissistic need)
- Capacity for work
- If development successful: "Love and work" are possible
- If fixated earlier: Neurotic symptoms, sexual dysfunction

**Healthy Adult**:
- Has successfully navigated all stages
- Can delay gratification (reality principle)
- Can love others (not just self)
- Productive work
- Integrated personality

=========================================
DEFENSE MECHANISMS
=========================================

**REPRESSION** (Primary Defense):
- Unconscious exclusion of painful thoughts/wishes from awareness
- Active process requiring psychic energy
- Repressed material remains active in unconscious
- Returns in distorted form (symptoms, slips, dreams)
- "Foundation-stone of psychoanalysis"

**PROJECTION**:
- Attributing own unacceptable impulses to others
- "I don't hate him; HE hates ME"
- Extreme form = paranoia
- Allows disowning of one's own feelings

**DENIAL**:
- Refusing to acknowledge painful reality
- Most primitive defense
- "No, that didn't happen"
- Seen in psychosis, grief, trauma

**DISPLACEMENT**:
- Redirecting impulse from original target to safer substitute
- Angry at boss → kick the dog
- Phobias often use displacement (fear of father → fear of horses)

**SUBLIMATION**:
- Channeling unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable forms
- Sexual/aggressive energy → art, science, culture
- Only truly healthy defense
- Allows gratification without repression
- Basis of civilization

**REACTION FORMATION**:
- Converting impulse into its opposite
- Unconscious hostility → excessive affection
- Forbidden lust → prudishness
- "The lady doth protest too much"

**RATIONALIZATION**:
- Creating acceptable explanation for unacceptable impulse
- Post-hoc justification
- Intellectual cover for emotional truth
- "Sour grapes" mechanism

**REGRESSION**:
- Returning to earlier developmental stage
- Stressed adult → childlike behavior
- Neurotic symptom = partial regression to fixation point

**IDENTIFICATION**:
- Incorporating another person's characteristics
- Child identifies with same-sex parent (Oedipal resolution)
- Can be defensive (identifying with aggressor)

**INTELLECTUALIZATION**:
- Using abstract thinking to avoid emotional experience
- Obsessional defense
- Talking about feelings to avoid feeling them

**UNDOING**:
- Compulsive act to symbolically reverse previous act
- Obsessional defense
- Magical thinking: "If I do this ritual, I'll undo that thought"

=========================================
DREAM THEORY
=========================================

**FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE**:
- "Every dream is wish-fulfillment"
- Even nightmares (wish for punishment, masochistic wish)

**MANIFEST vs. LATENT CONTENT**:
- **Manifest**: What dream appears to be about (surface story)
- **Latent**: Unconscious wish being expressed (hidden meaning)
- Dream-work transforms latent into manifest
- Analysis reverses this: manifest → latent

**THE DREAM-WORK** (How latent becomes manifest):

**CONDENSATION**:
- Multiple ideas/wishes compressed into single image
- One dream element represents several latent thoughts
- Makes dreams seem brief compared to thoughts behind them

**DISPLACEMENT**:
- Emotional significance shifted from important to trivial elements
- Dream focuses on detail while missing main point
- Censorship mechanism

**SYMBOLIZATION**:
- Unconscious thoughts represented by symbols
- Not universal dictionary (need dreamer's associations)
- Common symbols:
  - Houses, rooms = body, womb
  - Climbing, flying = intercourse
  - Kings, queens = parents
  - Small animals = siblings
  - Water = birth, womb
  - Elongated objects = phallus
  - Containers = female genitals

**SECONDARY REVISION**:
- Conscious mind tidies the dream upon waking
- Makes it more logical, coherent
- Further distortion from original latent content

**DAY RESIDUE**:
- Recent experiences provide material for dream
- But real significance comes from connection to deeper wishes
- Trivial events selected because they connect to unconscious

**CENSORSHIP**:
- Unconscious wishes too threatening for consciousness
- Must be disguised to slip past censorship
- Dream distortion = compromise between wish and censorship

=========================================
ANXIETY THEORY
=========================================

**THREE TYPES OF ANXIETY**:

**REALISTIC ANXIETY**:
- Response to real external danger
- Adaptive, appropriate
- "Fear"
- Ego perceives threat from environment

**NEUROTIC ANXIETY**:
- Fear that id impulses will break through ego's control
- Fear of being overwhelmed by drives
- Ego fears id
- Produces inhibitions, symptoms

**MORAL ANXIETY**:
- Guilt, shame
- Fear of superego's punishment
- Internalized parental anger
- "Conscience"

**ANXIETY AS SIGNAL**:
- Later theory: anxiety as ego's warning signal
- Signals danger (from id, superego, or reality)
- Triggers defense mechanisms
- Small amount of anxiety prevents larger trauma

=========================================
LIBIDO THEORY
=========================================

**LIBIDO**:
- Psychic sexual energy
- Quantitative (can be more or less)
- Seeking discharge (pleasure principle)
- Can be **cathected** (invested) in:
  - Objects (object-libido)
  - Self (narcissistic libido)
  - Symptoms (conversion, fixation)

**OBJECT CHOICE**:
- **Anaclitic** (attachment type): Choose object based on who nurtured
- **Narcissistic**: Choose object resembling self
- Adult love = refinding of childhood object

**NARCISSISM**:
- **Primary**: Infant's self-love before object-relations
- **Secondary**: Withdrawal of libido from objects back to self
- Psychosis involves extreme narcissistic withdrawal

**CATHEXIS**:
- Investment of libidinal energy in object or idea
- Can be withdrawn and reinvested
- "Damming up" of libido = neurosis

=========================================
DEATH DRIVE (LATER THEORY)
=========================================

**DUAL INSTINCT THEORY**:

**EROS** (Life Drive):
- Seeks to create, unite, build
- Libido, sexual drive
- Civilization as Eros combining individuals

**THANATOS** (Death Drive):
- Seeks to destroy, disintegrate, return to inorganic
- "The aim of all life is death"
- Aggression, destruction
- Turned inward = masochism, guilt
- Turned outward = sadism, violence

**REPETITION COMPULSION**:
- Beyond pleasure principle
- Compulsion to repeat traumatic experiences
- Evidence for death drive
- Organism seeks to return to earlier state (ultimately: inorganic)

=========================================
RESISTANCE & TRANSFERENCE
=========================================

**RESISTANCE**:
- Patient's opposition to becoming conscious of repressed material
- "Whatever disturbs analytic work is resistance"

**Observable Signs** (not circular!):
- Sudden topic changes when approaching complex
- Forgetting appointments (especially when making progress)
- Falling silent, claiming "nothing to say"
- Physical symptoms (headaches, fatigue) during difficult sessions
- Arriving late, leaving early
- Intense emotional reactions disproportionate to topic
- Intellectualizing to avoid feeling

**Function**:
- Ego defending against anxiety of unconscious material
- Proximity to complex = intensity of resistance
- Working through resistance is therapeutic

**TRANSFERENCE**:
- Patient transfers feelings about early figures onto analyst
- Relives childhood relationships in therapeutic relationship
- **Positive Transference**: Loves analyst (like parent)
- **Negative Transference**: Hates analyst (like parent)

**Types**:
- **Paternal Transference**: Analyst as father-figure
- **Maternal Transference**: Analyst as mother-figure
- **Erotic Transference**: Sexual feelings toward analyst
- **Hostile Transference**: Anger, suspicion toward analyst

**Therapeutic Use**:
- "Transference neurosis": Re-experiencing neurosis in analysis
- Working through transference = working through original conflict
- "The battlefield where all conflicting forces must meet"

=========================================
SYMPTOM FORMATION
=========================================

**SYMPTOM AS COMPROMISE**:
- Between unconscious wish and defense against it
- Partial gratification + partial punishment
- Both forces represented in single symptom

**CONVERSION** (Hysteria):
- Psychic energy converted to physical symptom
- Symbolic representation of repressed wish
- Aphonia, paralysis, pain with no organic basis
- "Body speaks what mind cannot"

**OBSESSIONAL SYMPTOMS**:
- Intellectual defenses against wishes
- Undoing, isolation, reaction formation
- Thoughts and compulsions replace emotions
- Ambivalence central

**OVERDETERMINATION**:
- Single symptom has multiple meanings/causes
- Represents several repressed wishes
- Connects to multiple developmental issues
- No simple one-to-one symbolism

=========================================
TECHNIQUE & METHOD
=========================================

**FREE ASSOCIATION**:
- "Fundamental rule": Say everything that comes to mind
- No censoring, no selecting
- Bypasses conscious control
- Reveals unconscious connections
- "Follow the thread wherever it leads"

**INTERPRETATION**:
- Analyst explains unconscious meaning
- Must be timed correctly (not premature)
- Patient must be ready to accept
- Working through, not just intellectual insight

**ABSTINENCE**:
- Analyst doesn't gratify patient's wishes
- Maintains professional boundaries
- Doesn't give advice or reassurance
- Creates frustration that drives analysis

**NEUTRALITY**:
- Analyst as "blank screen"
- Minimal self-disclosure
- Allows transference to develop
- Patient projects onto analyst

**EVENLY SUSPENDED ATTENTION**:
- Analyst listens without focusing on anything particular
- Allows unconscious communication
- Attends to own associations too
- Receptive, not directive

=========================================
FICTION-WRITING REFERENCE
=========================================

Use these concepts when writing Freud-voice fiction:

**For Case Studies**:
- Deploy specific defense mechanisms
- Show symptom as compromise formation
- Trace to developmental stage fixation
- Reveal unconscious wish through analysis

**For Theoretical Discussion**:
- Reference structural model (id/ego/superego)
- Discuss libido investment and withdrawal
- Explain through psychosexual development
- Use proper psychoanalytic terminology

**For Dream Interpretation**:
- Distinguish manifest from latent content
- Show dream-work mechanisms
- Provide detailed symbolic analysis
- Connect to infantile wish

**Voice Consistency**:
- Technical precision
- Clinical authority
- Empirical framing
- Defensive but confident
- "Those who have observed know..."
