KEY CONCEPTS & EXCERPTS
=========================================

**ON THE UNCONSCIOUS**:

"The unconscious is the true psychic reality; in its innermost nature it is as much unknown to us as the reality of the external world, and it is as incompletely presented by the data of consciousness as is the external world by the communications of our sense organs."
[The Interpretation of Dreams]

**ON DREAMS**:

"The interpretation of dreams is the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind."
[The Interpretation of Dreams]

"Every dream is a wish-fulfillment."
[The Interpretation of Dreams]

**ON INFANTILE SEXUALITY**:

"One of the most important, as well as one of the most disputed findings of psycho-analytic research is that the sexual instinct in man does not make its appearance at puberty, but is active from birth onward."
[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]

**ON OEDIPUS COMPLEX**:

"His destiny moves us only because it might have been ours - because the oracle laid the same curse upon us before our birth as upon him. It is the fate of all of us, perhaps, to direct our first sexual impulse towards our mother and our first hatred and our first murderous wish against our father."
[The Interpretation of Dreams]

**ON REPRESSION**:

"Repression is the foundation-stone on which the whole structure of psychoanalysis rests."
[On the History of the Psycho-Analytic Movement]

**ON RESISTANCE**:

"Whatever disturbs the progress of analytic work is a resistance."
[Introductory Lectures]

**ON TRANSFERENCE**:

"Transference, which seems ordained to be the greatest obstacle to psychoanalysis, becomes its most powerful ally, if its presence can be detected each time and explained to the patient."
[Fragment of an Analysis (Dora)]

**ON PSYCHOANALYTIC METHOD**:

"Psycho-analysis is an instrument to enable the ego to achieve a progressive conquest of the id."
[The Ego and the Id]

"Where id was, there ego shall be."
[New Introductory Lectures]

**ON CIVILIZATION**:

"Civilization is a process in the service of Eros, whose purpose is to combine single human individuals, and after that families, then races, peoples and nations, into one great unity, the unity of mankind."
[Civilization and Its Discontents]

**ON RELIGION**:

"Religion is an illusion and it derives its strength from the fact that it falls in with our instinctual desires."
[New Introductory Lectures]

"The derivation of religious needs from the infant's helplessness and the longing for the father aroused by it seems to me incontrovertible."
[Civilization and Its Discontents]

REPRESENTATIVE PASSAGES
=========================================

**FROM "The Interpretation of Dreams" - On Dream-Work**:

"The dream-content seems like a transcript of the dream-thoughts into another mode of expression, whose characters and syntactic laws it is our business to discover by comparing the original and the translation. The dream-thoughts are immediately comprehensible, as soon as we have learnt them. The dream-content, on the other hand, is expressed as it were in a pictographic script, the characters of which have to be transposed individually into the language of the dream-thoughts. If we attempted to read these characters according to their pictorial value instead of according to their symbolic relation, we should clearly be led into error."

**FROM "Dora" - On Resistance**:

"The patient's falling silent often indicated that she was turning over in her mind some thought connected to the material produced so far. And indeed, every time such silences ended, she would often produce the most important associations. It was as though the resistance had to be conquered not just once but repeatedly, and each small victory over it allowed the next piece of unconscious material to emerge."

**FROM "The Ego and the Id" - On Psychic Structures**:

"We are warned by a proverb against serving two masters at the same time. The poor ego has things even worse: it serves three severe masters and does what it can to bring their claims and demands into harmony with one another. These claims are always divergent and often seem incompatible. No wonder that the ego so often fails in its task. Its three tyrannical masters are the external world, the super-ego and the id."

**FROM "Civilization and Its Discontents" - On Sublimation**:

"Sublimation of instinct is an especially conspicuous feature of cultural development; it is what makes it possible for higher psychical activities, scientific, artistic or ideological, to play such an important part in civilized life. If one were to yield to a first impression, one would say that sublimation is a vicissitude which has been forced upon the instincts entirely by civilization. But it would be wiser to reflect upon this matter for a longer time."
