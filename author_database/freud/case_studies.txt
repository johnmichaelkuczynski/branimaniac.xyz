SIGMUND FREUD - CASE STUDIES REFERENCE

=========================================
OVERVIEW
=========================================

Freud's case studies serve multiple functions:
1. **Clinical Evidence** - Proof that psychoanalysis works
2. **Theory Demonstration** - Abstract principles made concrete
3. **Methodological Model** - How to conduct analysis
4. **Narrative Form** - Bridge between science and literature

Structure typically follows:
- Patient presentation (symptoms, background)
- Analytical sessions (dreams, associations, resistances)
- Interpretations offered
- Resistance and transference dynamics
- Breakthrough insights
- Therapeutic outcome
- Theoretical extraction

=========================================
DORA (1905)
=========================================

=========================================
LITTLE HANS (1909)
=========================================

**Full Title**: "Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-Year-Old Boy"

- Fear horses will fall down
- Anxiety about going outside

**Background**:
- Only child (initially)
- Close relationship with mother
- Sister Hanna born when Hans is 3½
- Father = Freud's colleague, conducts analysis under Freud's supervision

**Key Elements**:

**Sexual Curiosity**:
- Questions about "widdlers" (penises)
- Notices mother, sister, animals have different anatomy
- Masturbation and mother's threat ("Doctor will cut it off")
- Castration anxiety emerging

**The Phobia Development**:

- "Giraffe fantasy" (taking mother from father)
- "Plumber fantasy" (plumber removes and replaces his widdler with bigger one)
- "Children fantasy" (imagines having children with mother)
- All reveal Oedipal wishes

**Resolution**:
- Talking about fears reduces them
- Understanding horse = father helps
- Phobia gradually resolves
- Castration anxiety managed

**Theoretical Contributions**:
- Oedipus complex documented in childhood (not just reconstructed)
- Phobia as displaced anxiety
- Infantile sexuality observed directly
- Child analysis possibility demonstrated

**Narrative Technique**:
- Father reports to Freud
- Freud interprets, father relays interpretations
- Hans's own words extensively quoted

=========================================
RAT MAN (1909)
=========================================

**Patient**: Ernst Lanzer (pseudonym: Rat Man), age 29, lawyer

**Presenting Symptoms**:
- Obsessional thoughts
- Compulsive behaviors
- Cannot work effectively
- Tormented by cruel rat torture fantasy

**The Rat Torture**:
- Captain describes Oriental torture: rat burrows into anus
- Rat Man becomes obsessed with this image

- Complex compulsive defenses against this thought

**Compulsive Behaviors**:
- Must pay back money in impossibly complicated way
- Elaborate rituals to prevent harm to father (who's actually dead)
- Can't work, paralyzed by obsessional thoughts

**Analysis Reveals**:

**Ambivalence Toward Father**:
- Loves father, also hates him
- Rat = "Ratten" = installments/debts (German wordplay)
- Father opposed his marriage choice
- Rat Man wishes father dead, then feels guilt

**Childhood Elements**:
- As child, had rage attacks
- Father punished him
- Learned to repress anger
- Developed obsessional defenses

**Sexual Conflict**:
- Desires "lady" (upper-class woman, poor)
- Also attracted to woman father wanted him to marry (rich)
- Conflict: love vs. material advantage
- Repeating father's own dilemma

**Defense Mechanisms**:
- Undoing (compulsive actions to undo thoughts)
- Isolation (separating affect from idea)
- Reaction formation (turning hostility to excessive concern)
- Displacement (from person to rats)

**Therapeutic Outcome**:
- Successful analysis
- Symptoms resolved
- Able to work and love
- Later died in WWI

**Theoretical Contributions**:
- Obsessional neurosis mapped comprehensively
- Ambivalence as core of obsessional structure
- Defense mechanisms catalog
- Magical thinking and omnipotence of thoughts

**Narrative Technique**:

=========================================
WOLF MAN (1918)
=========================================

**Full Title**: "From the History of an Infantile Neurosis"

**Patient**: Sergei Pankejeff (pseudonym: Wolf Man), Russian aristocrat

**Presenting Symptoms**:
- Obsessional neurosis
- Depression
- "Veiled" from reality
- Cannot function

**The Wolf Dream** (age 4):
- Bedroom window opens
- White wolves sitting in walnut tree
- Silent, staring at him with fixed attention
- Terrified, screams, wakes

**Analysis of Dream**:
- Wolves = parents
- Stillness = reversal of motion
- Primal scene witnessed (age 1½): parents copulating
- Copulation observed "a tergo" (from behind)
- This traumatic observation creates later neurosis

**Infantile Sexual Development**:

**Age 1½**: Primal scene witnessed

**Age 3**: Seduced by sister (showed her genitals)

**Age 3-4**: Religious obsessions develop
- Kisses holy pictures compulsively
- Blasphemous thoughts intrude
- Obsessional doubting begins

**Age 4-5**: Phobia of wolves and butterflies

**Key Theoretical Elements**:

**Primal Scene Debate**:
- Did he really witness it at 1½?
- Or fantasy constructed later?
- Freud argues: real observation
- Impact delayed until age 4 (deferred action)

**Castration Complex**:
- Sees sister's genitals (age 3)
- Realizes she's been "castrated"
- Fear he'll suffer same fate
- Defends through passivity toward father

**Passive vs. Active**:
- Identification with passive (feminine) position toward father
- Creates homosexual orientation anxiety
- Defense: becomes obsessional

**Bowel Symbolism**:
- Birth theory: babies born through anus
- Links copulation, castration, childbirth fantasies
- Money (gifts) = feces = baby

**Theoretical Contributions**:
- Infantile neurosis fully analyzed
- Primal scene impact documented
- Deferred action (Nachträglichkeit)
- Reconstruction in analysis validated

**Narrative Technique**:
- Detective story quality
- Layers of interpretation
- Wolf dream as centerpiece
- Complex theoretical apparatus

=========================================
SCHREBER (1911)
=========================================

**Full Title**: "Psycho-Analytic Notes on an Autobiographical Account of a Case of Paranoia (Dementia Paranoides)"

**Patient**: Daniel Paul Schreber, Judge, German Appeals Court

**Unique Situation**:
- Freud never met Schreber
- Analysis based on published memoir: "Memoirs of My Nervous Illness"
- Demonstrates analysis can work from texts

**Schreber's Delusions**:

**Religious/Cosmic**:
- In direct communication with God
- World has ended (only he survives)
- Mission to redeem world
- Will be transformed into woman to birth new race

- Flechsig = "soul murderer"
- Rays beaming into his body
- Voices harassing him

**Somatic**:
- Body being transformed into woman
- Breasts growing
- Nerves of voluptuousness
- Will achieve female sexual pleasure

**Freud's Analysis**:

**Central Mechanism: Projection**:
- Unconscious homosexual wish toward father-figure
- Cannot accept: "I love him (man)"
- Contradictory transformations:
  - Love → hate: "I hate him"
  - Subject/object reversal: "He hates me" (persecution)
  - Gender transformation: "I love him because I'm woman"

**Father-Figures**:
- Dr. Flechsig = persecutor (initially)
- God = Father
- Relationship to father revealed through delusions

**Megalomania**:
- Grandiose delusions (redeem world, communicate with God)
- Narcissistic defense
- Withdraws libido from world
- Reinvests in inflated self

**Theoretical Contributions**:
- Paranoia as defense against homosexuality
- Projection mechanism demonstrated
- Narcissism and psychosis
- Analysis without direct patient contact possible

**Narrative Technique**:
- Quotes extensively from Schreber's memoir
- Close textual analysis
- Interpretive commentary
- Detective work from symptoms to unconscious
