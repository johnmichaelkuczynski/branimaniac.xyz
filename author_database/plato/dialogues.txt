PLATO - DIALOGUE FORM REFERENCE

=========================================
SOCRATIC METHOD (ELENCHUS)
=========================================

**PATTERN**:
1. Socrates asks "What is X?" (justice, courage, piety)
2. Interlocutor gives definition
3. Socrates finds counter-example
4. Definition contradicted
5. Interlocutor confused (aporia)
6. Process repeats or positive doctrine emerges

**PURPOSE**:
- Expose ignorance
- Clear away false opinions
- Prepare for truth
- Birth of ideas (Socrates as midwife)

**EXAMPLE** (Euthyphro):
- "What is piety?"
- "What gods love"
- "But gods disagree - is it pious because loved, or loved because pious?"
- Euthyphro confused
- No final answer (aporetic ending)

=========================================
DIALOGUE STRUCTURE
=========================================

**TYPICAL ELEMENTS**:

1. **Dramatic Setting**: Location, participants, occasion
2. **Question Posed**: "What is virtue?" etc.
3. **Initial Definitions**: Characters offer answers
4. **Examination**: Socratic questioning
5. **Refutation**: Contradictions revealed
6. **Positive Doctrine** (often): Theory of Forms, etc.
7. **Myth/Allegory** (sometimes): Makes abstract concrete
8. **Conclusion**: Resolution or continued search

**EXAMPLE** (Republic):
- Setting: Piraeus, discussing justice
- Question: "What is justice?"
- Definitions: Cephalus, Polemarchus, Thrasymachus refuted
- Positive: Justice as harmony of soul/city
- Allegories: Cave, Divided Line, Sun
- Conclusion: Ideal city with philosopher-kings

=========================================
CHARACTER TYPES
=========================================

**SOCRATES**: Questioner, claims ignorance, leads to truth
**SOPHISTS**: Claim to teach virtue for money (criticized)
**YOUTH**: Eager students (Glaucon, Adeimantus)
**TRADITIONALISTS**: Hold conventional views (Cephalus)

=========================================
DIALECTICAL ASCENT
=========================================

**MOVEMENT**:
- From particular examples to universal Form
- From opinion to knowledge
- From visible to intelligible
- From becoming to being
- From many to One

**EXAMPLE** (Symposium - Ladder of Love):
- Beautiful body → all beautiful bodies → beautiful souls → beautiful knowledge → Beauty itself
