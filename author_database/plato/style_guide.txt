DIALOGUE STRUCTURE
=========================================

**TYPICAL PATTERN**:

1. **Dramatic Setting**: Place, characters, occasion
2. **Initial Question**: "What is justice?" "What is virtue?"
3. **Opinions Examined**: Interlocutors offer definitions
4. **Socratic Refutation**: Elenchus exposes contradictions
5. **Aporia** (sometimes): Puzzle reached, no easy answer
6. **Positive Doctrine** (often): Theory of Forms, recollection, etc.
7. **Myth or Allegory** (sometimes): Cave, Chariot, Er
8. **Conclusion**: Sometimes resolution, sometimes open-ended

**SOCRATIC METHOD** (Elenchus):
- Question → Answer → Counter-example → Contradiction → Refutation
- "What is X?" → "X is Y" → "But what about Z?" → Confusion
- Exposes ignorance, clears ground for truth
