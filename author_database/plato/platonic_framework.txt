PLATO - PLATONIC FRAMEWORK (SYSTEMATIC)

=========================================
METAPHYSICS - TWO REALMS
=========================================

**WORLD OF FORMS** (Being):
- Eternal, unchanging, perfect
- Known through reason
- True reality
- Example: Form of Beauty itself

**PHYSICAL WORLD** (Becoming):
- Temporal, changing, imperfect
- Known through senses
- Shadows/copies of Forms
- Example: Beautiful things

**RELATIONSHIP**:
- Physical "participates" in Forms
- Forms are "models," physical are "copies"
- Form of Good highest - source of all being and truth

=========================================
EPISTEMOLOGY - KNOWLEDGE vs. OPINION
=========================================

**KNOWLEDGE** (Episteme):
- Of Forms (unchanging)
- Certain, justified
- Through dialectic (reason)
- Philosopher attains this

**OPINION** (Doxa):
- Of physical world (changing)
- Uncertain, unjustified
- Through perception
- Most people have only this

**DIVIDED LINE** (Republic VI):
1. **Imagination** (eikasia) - shadows, reflections
2. **Belief** (pistis) - physical objects
3. **Thought** (dianoia) - mathematics, hypotheses
4. **Understanding** (noesis) - dialectic, Forms

Only #4 is true knowledge.

=========================================
PSYCHOLOGY - TRIPARTITE SOUL
=========================================

**THREE PARTS**:
1. **Reason** (logistikon) - rational, knows Forms, should rule
2. **Spirit** (thymoeides) - spirited, seeks honor, courage
3. **Appetite** (epithymetikon) - desires pleasure, food, sex

**VIRTUE** = Harmony of parts, Reason ruling
**VICE** = Discord, lower parts ruling

**IMMORTALITY**:
- Soul exists before birth
- Knew Forms in pre-existence
- Birth = forgetting
- Learning = recollection (anamnesis)
- Soul survives death

=========================================
ETHICS - CARDINAL VIRTUES
=========================================

1. **Wisdom** - Reason's virtue (knowledge of Good)
2. **Courage** - Spirit's virtue (right fear/confidence)
3. **Temperance** - Harmony of all parts (self-control)
4. **Justice** - Each part doing its work

**EUDAIMONIA** (Flourishing):
- Comes from virtuous soul (harmony)
- Justice benefits the just person
- Injustice harms soul (disharmony)

=========================================
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY - IDEAL CITY
=========================================

**THREE CLASSES** (mirror soul):
1. **Guardians/Rulers** (Reason) - philosophers, wisdom
2. **Auxiliaries** (Spirit) - soldiers, courage
3. **Producers** (Appetite) - farmers, craftsmen

**JUSTICE IN CITY**:
Each class does its proper work in harmony.

**PHILOSOPHER-KINGS**:
- Must know Forms, especially the Good
- 50 years of training
- Reluctant rulers (prefer contemplation)
- Rule by knowledge, not opinion

**EDUCATION**:
- Gymnastics (body) + Music (soul)
- Mathematics (prepare for Forms)
- Dialectic (grasp Forms)
- Descent back to cave (rule reluctantly)

=========================================
AESTHETICS & LOVE
=========================================

**LADDER OF LOVE** (Symposium):
1. Love one beautiful body
2. Love all beautiful bodies
3. Love beautiful souls
4. Love beautiful pursuits/knowledge
5. Love Beauty itself (Form)

**EROS**: Desire for what we lack, drives ascent to Forms

**ART** (Republic X):
- Imitation of imitation (third from truth)
- Physical things imitate Forms
- Art imitates physical things
- Therefore art is shadows of shadows
- Dangerous (misleads soul from truth)

=========================================
COSMOLOGY (TIMAEUS)
=========================================

**DEMIURGE**:
- Divine craftsman
- Creates world by looking at Forms
- Imposes order on chaos
- World is living creature with soul

**CREATION**:
- Not ex nihilo (from nothing)
- From pre-existing matter (chaos)
- Demiurge makes it good as possible
- But limited by necessity of matter

=========================================
METHODOLOGY - DIALECTIC
=========================================

**DIALECTICAL METHOD**:
1. Examine opinions
2. Refute contradictions (elenchus)
3. Ascend from particulars to universal Form
4. Grasp Form through reason
5. Descend to explain particulars

**VS. SOPHISTRY**:
- Dialectic seeks truth
- Sophistry seeks persuasion
- Dialectic for wisdom
- Sophistry for power/money

=========================================
APPLICATION TO FICTION WRITING
=========================================

**DIALOGUE FORM**:
- Characters engage philosophically
- Socratic questioning
- Dramatic settings
- Real positions tested

**THEMATIC MATERIAL**:
- Forms as true reality
- Cave allegory (enlightenment)
- Soul's immortality and recollection
- Justice in soul and city
- Philosopher-king ideal
- Ascent to the Good/Beautiful
- Education as turning soul to light

**STYLISTIC MARKERS**:
- Dialectical questioning
- Mathematical precision
- Myths and allegories
- Conversational yet profound
- Step-by-step agreement
- Irony (Socratic ignorance)

**STRUCTURE**:
- Question → Examination → Refutation → Positive Doctrine → Myth → Conclusion
