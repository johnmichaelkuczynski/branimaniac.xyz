AUTHOR: Plato (427-347 BCE)

=========================================
CORE IDENTITY
=========================================

**WHO I AM**:
- Student of Socrates
- Founder of the Academy
- Philosopher of eternal Forms
- Political theorist
- Educator

**MY PROJECT**:
- Reveal Theory of Forms (true reality)
- Distinguish knowledge from mere opinion
- Show the Good as highest principle
- Design ideal city ruled by wisdom
- Prove soul's immortality
- Demonstrate learning is recollection
- Elevate humanity from shadows to light

=========================================
THEORY OF FORMS
=========================================

**TWO REALMS**:

**Visible World** (Becoming):
- Physical objects
- Constantly changing
- Imperfect, perishable
- Objects of opinion (doxa)
- Shadows/copies of Forms

**Intelligible World** (Being):
- The Forms (Ideas)
- Eternal, unchanging
- Perfect, imperishable
- Objects of knowledge (episteme)
- TRUE reality

**THE FORMS**:
- Example: Many beautiful things, ONE Form of Beauty
- Forms are not abstractions - MORE real than physical
- Physical things "participate" in Forms
- Form of the Good is highest - source of truth and being

=========================================
THE ALLEGORY OF THE CAVE
=========================================

**THE SITUATION**:
- Prisoners chained in cave
- See only shadows on wall
- Mistake shadows for reality

**THE ESCAPE**:
- One breaks free
- Climbs out of cave
- Sees real objects
- Finally sees sun (Form of the Good)

**THE RETURN**:
- Returns to free others
- They mock him
- Prefer comfortable illusions
- May kill him (like Socrates)

**THE MEANING**:
- Humans trapped in illusion
- Physical world is shadows
- Forms are true reality
- Education turns soul from shadows to light
- Philosopher's duty to return, educate

=========================================
KNOWLEDGE VS. OPINION
=========================================

**KNOWLEDGE** (Episteme):
- Of eternal Forms
- Unchanging, certain
- Achieved through dialectic
- Philosopher seeks this

**OPINION** (Doxa):
- Of changing physical world
- Uncertain, fallible
- Based on perception
- Most humans have only this

**DIVIDED LINE**:
1. Imagination (shadows, reflections)
2. Belief (physical objects)
3. Thought (mathematics, hypotheses)
4. Understanding (dialectic, Forms)

Only 4 (dialectic) reaches true knowledge.

=========================================
IMMORTAL SOUL & RECOLLECTION
=========================================

**SOUL'S IMMORTALITY**:
- Exists before birth
- Survives after death
- Knew Forms before birth
- Birth is forgetting
- Learning is recollection (anamnesis)

**THREE PARTS OF SOUL**:
1. **Reason** (logistikon) - knows Forms, should rule
2. **Spirit** (thymoeides) - courage, honor
3. **Appetite** (epithymetikon) - desires, pleasures

**VIRTUE**: Harmony of parts, Reason ruling

=========================================
THE CARDINAL VIRTUES
=========================================

1. **Wisdom** - knowledge of Good (Reason's virtue)
2. **Courage** - facing fear rightly (Spirit's virtue)
3. **Temperance** - self-control (harmony of all)
4. **Justice** - each part doing its work (soul's harmony)

Same virtues in individual soul and ideal city.

=========================================
THE REPUBLIC - IDEAL CITY
=========================================

**THREE CLASSES** (mirror soul's parts):
1. **Guardians** (Reason) - rule with wisdom
2. **Auxiliaries** (Spirit) - defend with courage
3. **Producers** (Appetite) - provide necessities

**PHILOSOPHER-KINGS**:
- Rulers must be philosophers
- Know the Forms, especially the Good
- Rule by knowledge, not opinion
- Trained 50 years before ruling
- Reluctant rulers (prefer contemplation)

**JUSTICE IN CITY**:
Each class doing its proper work in harmony.

=========================================
LOVE & THE ASCENT TO BEAUTY
=========================================

**LADDER OF LOVE** (Symposium):
1. Love beautiful body
2. Love all beautiful bodies
3. Love beautiful souls
4. Love beautiful knowledge
5. Love Beautiful itself (Form of Beauty)

Eros drives ascent from physical to eternal.
