KEY EXCERPTS & PASSAGES
=========================================

**FROM THE GAY SCIENCE**:

**The Madman** (Section 125):
"Have you not heard of that madman who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours, ran to the market place, and cried incessantly: 'I seek God! I seek God!'... The madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes. 'Whither is God?' he cried; 'I will tell you. We have killed him—you and I. All of us are his murderers... God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.'"

**Eternal Recurrence** (Section 341):
"What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more'... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.'"

**FROM THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA**:

**Prologue**:
"I teach you the Übermensch. Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him?... Man is a rope, tied between beast and Übermensch—a rope over an abyss."

**On the Last Man**:
"'We have invented happiness,' say the last men, and they blink... A little poison now and then: that makes for agreeable dreams. And much poison at last, for an agreeable death."

**FROM BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL**:

"There are no moral phenomena at all, but only a moral interpretation of phenomena."

"He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you."

**FROM ON THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS**:

**First Essay** (Good and Evil, Good and Bad):
"The slave revolt in morality begins when ressentiment itself becomes creative and gives birth to values: the ressentiment of natures that are denied the true reaction, that of deeds, and compensate themselves with an imaginary revenge."

**Second Essay** (Guilt, Bad Conscience):
"All instincts that do not discharge themselves outwardly turn inward—this is what I call the internalization of man: thus it was that man first developed what was later called his 'soul.'"

**FROM TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS**:

"What does not kill me makes me stronger."

"'Reason' in philosophy: morality, religion—now I understand that every one of them is supposed to have been an invention of Socrates, Plato, or some other life-denying madman."

**FROM THE ANTICHRIST**:

"Christianity is called the religion of pity. Pity stands opposed to the tonic emotions which heighten our vitality: it has a depressing effect... Pity on the whole thwarts the law of evolution, which is the law of selection."

**FROM ECCE HOMO**:

"I am not a man, I am dynamite."

"Some men are born posthumously."

"My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary... but love it."

APHORISMS BY TOPIC
=========================================

**ON TRUTH**:
"There are no facts, only interpretations."
"Truths are illusions we have forgotten are illusions."
"Truth is the kind of error without which a certain species of life could not live."

**ON POWER**:
"Where I found the living, there I found will to power."
"What is good? Everything that heightens the feeling of power in man, the will to power, power itself."

**ON SUFFERING**:
"To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering."
"That which does not kill me makes me stronger."

**ON BECOMING**:
"Become who you are!"
"One must still have chaos in oneself to give birth to a dancing star."

**ON LIFE**:
"Without music, life would be a mistake."
"And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music."
"The higher we soar, the smaller we appear to those who cannot fly."
