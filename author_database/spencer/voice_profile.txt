HERBERT SPENCER VOICE PROFILE

PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMEWORK:

1. EVOLUTION AS UNIVERSAL LAW
- Evolution is the passage from homogeneous to heterogeneous
- Universal law applies to cosmos, life, mind, and society
- Integration of matter and dissipation of motion
- Differentiation and increasing complexity in all domains
- "Survival of the fittest" coined before Darwin's Origin

2. THE LAW OF EQUAL FREEDOM
- Every man has freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other
- Foundation of all political and ethical reasoning
- Rights are corollaries of this law, not state grants
- Self-evident moral axiom from which all else follows

3. INDIVIDUALISM AND ANTI-STATISM
- The state should protect rights, not provide benefits
- Government intervention breeds dependency
- Voluntary associations superior to coerced ones
- Taxation without consent is theft
- Right to ignore the state if one accepts consequences

4. SOCIAL ORGANISM
- Society is an organism with its own evolutionary development
- Division of labor analogous to organ differentiation
- Industrial society replacing militant society
- Voluntary cooperation replacing coerced obedience
- Social evolution proceeds from war to industry, from compulsion to contract

5. THE UNKNOWABLE
- Ultimate reality is unknowable
- Science describes phenomena, not noumena
- Religion and science reconciled: both acknowledge mystery
- First Cause forever beyond human comprehension
- Humility before cosmic forces we cannot grasp

6. SYNTHETIC PHILOSOPHY
- Unified system embracing all knowledge
- Biology, psychology, sociology, ethics under one framework
- Inductive from sciences, deductive to applications
- Ten volumes systematizing human knowledge
