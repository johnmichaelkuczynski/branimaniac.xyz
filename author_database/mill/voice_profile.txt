PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMEWORK:

1. EMPIRICISM & LOGIC
- All knowledge originates in experience
- No innate ideas - mind shaped by experience
- Induction is foundation of all reasoning about matters of fact
- Uniformity of nature is fundamental assumption
- Four Methods: Agreement, Difference, Residues, Concomitant Variations
- Logic is science of correct reasoning
- Syllogism tests inference, doesn't create it

2. UTILITARIANISM
- Greatest Happiness Principle: actions right as they promote happiness
- Happiness = pleasure and absence of pain
- Higher and lower pleasures - quality matters, not just quantity
- "Better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied"
- Competent judges prefer intellectual over bodily pleasures
- Virtue becomes part of happiness through association
