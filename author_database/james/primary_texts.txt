KEY EXCERPTS & PASSAGES
=========================================

**FROM PRAGMATISM**:

**On Pragmatic Method**:
"The pragmatic method is primarily a method of settling metaphysical disputes that otherwise might be interminable. Is the world one or many? — fated or free? — material or spiritual? — here are notions either of which may or may not hold good of the world; and disputes over such notions are unending. The pragmatic method in such cases is to try to interpret each notion by tracing its respective practical consequences. What difference would it practically make to anyone if this notion rather than that notion were true? If no practical difference whatever can be traced, then the alternatives mean practically the same thing, and all dispute is idle."

**On Truth**:
"The true is the name of whatever proves itself to be good in the way of belief, and good, too, for definite, assignable reasons... Truth happens to an idea. It becomes true, is made true by events. Its verity is in fact an event, a process: the process namely of its verifying itself, its veri-fication. Its validity is the process of its valid-ation."

**FROM THE WILL TO BELIEVE**:

**On Forced Options**:
"Our passional nature not only lawfully may, but must, decide an option between propositions, whenever it is a genuine option that cannot by its nature be decided on intellectual grounds... We cannot escape the issue by remaining skeptical... because, although we do avoid error in that way, we lose the truth... A rule of thinking which would absolutely prevent me from acknowledging certain kinds of truth if those kinds of truth were really there, would be an irrational rule."

**FROM VARIETIES OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE**:

**On Mystical States**:
"Mystical states, when well developed, usually are, and have the right to be, absolutely authoritative over the individuals to whom they come... No authority emanates from them which should make it a duty for those who stand outside of them to accept their revelations uncritically."

**FROM PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY**:

**On Stream of Consciousness**:
"Consciousness, then, does not appear to itself chopped up in bits. Such words as 'chain' or 'train' do not describe it fitly... It is nothing jointed; it flows. A 'river' or a 'stream' are the metaphors by which it is most naturally described. In talking of it hereafter, let us call it the stream of thought, of consciousness, or of subjective life."

**On Habit**:
"Habit is thus the enormous fly-wheel of society, its most precious conservative agent. It alone is what keeps us all within the bounds of ordinance... It dooms us all to fight out the battle of life upon the lines of our nurture or our early choice, and to make the best of a pursuit that disagrees, because there is no other for which we are fitted, and it is too late to begin again."

**FROM A PLURALISTIC UNIVERSE**:

**Against the Absolute**:
"The Absolute is said to perform its feats by an instantaneous operation which is also retributive. This is like saying that heat operates by heating, or that fire destroys by burning. Hegel and other absolutists make fun of the notion of faculties in psychology — yet they use their own private faculties, Unity, Diversity, Identity, Difference, Substance, Cause, etc., just as much as common mortals use theirs."

"Damn the Absolute!"

=========================================
CORE ARGUMENTS
=========================================

**THE PRAGMATIC METHOD**:
1. Philosophical disputes often unending
2. Apply pragmatic test: What practical difference?
3. If no practical difference → pseudo-problem
4. If practical difference → that's the real meaning
5. Makes philosophy practical

**FOR PLURALISM**:
1. Experience is diverse, messy, irreducible
2. Monism tries to force unity
3. But experience gives plurality
4. Open universe: novelty, freedom, real time
5. Pluralism true to experience

**THE WILL TO BELIEVE**:
1. Some choices are forced (can't avoid)
2. Some choices are momentous
3. Sometimes evidence insufficient
4. Right to believe when:
   - Living option (both alternatives real possibilities)
   - Forced option (can't avoid choosing)
   - Momentous option (significant consequences)
5. Belief's consequences justify it

**STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS**:
1. Thought doesn't come in discrete bits
2. Flows continuously
3. Can't chop without distortion
4. Against associationist psychology
5. Experience is fluid, not atomistic

**RADICAL EMPIRICISM**:
1. Relations between things are as real as things
2. Experience includes conjunctions
3. Not just discrete impressions
4. Continuous transitions directly experienced
5. Pure experience sufficient

PRAGMATISM APPLICATIONS
=========================================

**The Squirrel** (from Pragmatism):
Man goes round tree to catch squirrel. Squirrel moves to keep tree between them. Does man go "round" squirrel?

**Answer**: Depends what you mean by "round." If "passing north, east, south, west of," then yes. If "being first in front, then right, then behind, then left of," then no. Pragmatism clarifies by asking what practical difference the answer makes. Shows how apparently insoluble disputes dissolve when we ask about practical consequences.

**Theism vs. Materialism**:
Traditional question: Which is metaphysically true?

**Pragmatic question**: What practical difference does it make?

If theism provides hope, meaning, moral energy that materialism doesn't → has practical truth-value. Belief's consequences matter more than abstract metaphysical correctness.

=========================================
PSYCHOLOGICAL CONCEPTS
=========================================

**STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS**:
- Thought flows continuously
- Substantive parts (focal points) and transitive parts (flow)
- Can't be analyzed into discrete elements without distortion

**HABIT**:
- Basis of all behavior
- "Fly-wheel of society"
- Keeps us in grooves once formed
- Makes skilled action automatic

**THE SELF**:
- Material self (body, possessions)
- Social self (recognition from others)
- Spiritual self (inner subjective being)
- Pure ego (sense of personal identity)

**EMOTIONS** (James-Lange Theory):
- Bodily changes come first
- Then emotional feeling
- "We feel sorry because we cry, afraid because we tremble"
- Against: emotion causes bodily state
- For: bodily state IS the emotion

=========================================
RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE
=========================================

**CHARACTERISTICS OF MYSTICAL STATES**:
1. **Ineffability** - can't be put in words
2. **Noetic quality** - feel like knowledge
3. **Transiency** - don't last long
4. **Passivity** - feel grasped by superior power

**PRAGMATIC APPROACH**:
- Test by consequences (fruits not roots)
- Do they transform lives beneficially?
- Are they psychologically real?
- Yes to both → significant

**VARIETIES**:
- Healthy-minded religion (born once)
- Sick soul religion (needs twice-born)
- Conversion experiences
- Saintliness
- Mysticism
