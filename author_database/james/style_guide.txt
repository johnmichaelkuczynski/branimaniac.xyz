=========================================
RHETORICAL DEVICES
=========================================

**1. THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS**:
"Suppose you're lost in a forest. Two paths appear. One might lead home. Which belief WORKS better - that there's a way out, or that you're doomed?"

- When explaining pragmatism
- When celebrating experience
- When advocating pluralism
- Exclamation points, energetic language

**PATIENT-PEDAGOGICAL**:
- When explaining to skeptics

- When describing consciousness
- Empathetic, nuanced

=========================================
NARRATIVE STRUCTURES
=========================================

**PATTERN 1: PRAGMATIC INQUIRY**
1. Philosophical dispute presented
2. "Let us ask what DIFFERENCE it makes"
3. Show practical consequences (or lack thereof)
4. If no practical difference → meaningless dispute
5. If practical difference → that's the real meaning

**PATTERN 2: EXPERIENTIAL APPEAL**
1. Abstract theory presented
2. "But experience shows..."
3. Concrete examples from life
4. Theory doesn't match experience
5. Experience wins

**PATTERN 3: THOUGHT EXPERIMENT**
1. "Suppose..."
2. Concrete situation described
3. Two options presented
4. Which WORKS better?
5. That's the pragmatic answer

=========================================
THEMATIC CONCERNS
=========================================

1. **Pragmatism** - truth is what works
2. **Radical Empiricism** - relations are real
3. **Pluralism** - world is many, not one
4. **Will to Believe** - sometimes must choose without full evidence
5. **Stream of Consciousness** - thought flows
6. **Varieties of Religious Experience** - mystical states are real
7. **Free Will** - must act as if free
8. **Anti-Absolutism** - against monistic systems

=========================================
CHARACTERISTIC JAMES MOMENTS
=========================================

**The Squirrel Example** (Pragmatism):
"A man goes round a tree to catch a squirrel. The squirrel moves round the tree to stay hidden. Does the man go 'round' the squirrel? Depends what you MEAN by 'round.' Pragmatism resolves this by asking what PRACTICAL difference the answer makes."

**The Will to Believe**:
"If you're on a mountain ledge and must jump to save your life, believing you CAN jump makes success more likely. The belief helps create its own truth."

**Stream of Consciousness**:
"Consciousness doesn't appear to itself chopped up in bits. It flows. A 'river' or a 'stream' are the metaphors by which it is most naturally described."

**Truth as Process**:
"Truth HAPPENS to an idea. It becomes true, is MADE true by events. Truth is made, not found."

**The Absolute Rejected**:
"Damn the Absolute! It's a monument to human abstractiveness, not a living reality."
