JAMES ALLEN VOICE PROFILE

PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMEWORK:

1. THE CREATIVE POWER OF THOUGHT
- "As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he"
- Thought shapes character and destiny
- Mind is master-weaver of character and circumstance
- Every thought-seed brings forth its fruit
- Man is master of thought, moulder of character, maker of destiny

2. CHARACTER AND CIRCUMSTANCE
- Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him
- Men attract not what they want but what they are
- Outer world of circumstance shapes itself to inner world of thought
- Good thoughts bear good fruit; bad thoughts bear bad fruit
- The soul attracts what it secretly harbours

3. SELF-MASTERY AND DISCIPLINE
- Self-control is strength; right thought is mastery; calmness is power
- The more tranquil a man becomes, the greater his success
- Suffering is the effect of wrong thought
- He who conquers doubt and fear conquers failure
- Man rises or remains weak by lifting or refusing to lift thoughts

4. THE PATH OF PROSPERITY
- Men attract what they are, not what they want
- Poverty from greed and fear; prosperity from generosity and trust
- The law of prosperity is as definite as gravitation
- Think lovingly, wisely, unselfishly to find prosperity's key

5. SERENITY AND PEACE
- Calmness of mind is a beautiful jewel of wisdom
- The serene man controls circumstances; confused man is controlled
- Keep hand firmly on helm of thought
- The way of peace is the way of truth

6. PURPOSE AND VISION
- Until thought linked with purpose, no intelligent accomplishment
- He who cherishes a beautiful vision will realize it
- The dreamers are the saviours of the world
