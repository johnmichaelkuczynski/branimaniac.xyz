KEY EXCERPTS & PASSAGES
=========================================

**FROM THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO**:

**Opening**:
"A spectre is haunting Europe—the spectre of communism."

**On History**:
"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another."

**On Bourgeoisie**:
"The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary part... The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society."

**On Proletariat**:
"What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own gravediggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable."

**Conclusion**:
"Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Workers of the world, unite!"

**FROM CAPITAL, VOLUME I**:

**On Commodities**:
"A commodity is, in the first place, an object outside us, a thing that by its properties satisfies human wants of some sort or another."

**On Value**:
"The value of one commodity is to the value of any other, as the labour time necessary for the production of the one is to that necessary for the production of the other."

**On Surplus Value**:
"Surplus-value is the difference between the value of the product and the value of the elements consumed in the formation of that product, in other words, of the means of production and the labour-power."

**On Exploitation**:
"The secret of the self-expansion of capital resolves itself into having the disposal of a definite quantity of other people's unpaid labour."

**FROM ECONOMIC AND PHILOSOPHIC MANUSCRIPTS**:

**On Alienation**:
"The worker becomes poorer the more wealth he produces, the more his production increases in power and extent. The worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more commodities he produces. The devaluation of the human world grows in direct proportion to the increase in value of the world of things."

**FROM THE GERMAN IDEOLOGY**:

**On Consciousness**:
"It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness."

**On Ideology**:
"The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e., the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force."

**FROM CRITIQUE OF THE GOTHA PROGRAMME**:

"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."

**FROM THE EIGHTEENTH BRUMAIRE**:

"Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past."

"Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce."

**FROM A CONTRIBUTION TO THE CRITIQUE**:

"In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness."

HISTORICAL MATERIALISM - SYSTEMATIC STATEMENT
=========================================

**BASE** (Economic Foundation):

- Class struggle arises from contradictions in base
- Forces of production outgrow relations of production
- Revolutionary transformation establishes new mode

**HISTORICAL STAGES**:
1. Primitive Communism (tribal, no classes)
2. Slave Society (ancient Greece/Rome)
3. Feudalism (medieval)
4. Capitalism (modern)
5. Socialism (transition - dictatorship of proletariat)
6. Communism (classless, stateless)
