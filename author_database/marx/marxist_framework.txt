KARL MARX - MARXIST FRAMEWORK (SYSTEMATIC REFERENCE)

=========================================
HISTORICAL MATERIALISM
=========================================

**FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE**:
Material conditions of production determine social, political, and intellectual life.

**BASE AND SUPERSTRUCTURE MODEL**:

**ECONOMIC BASE** (Foundation):
1. **Forces of Production**:
   - Technology (tools, machines)
   - Labor power (workers' skills, knowledge)
   - Organization of production (factory system, cooperation)
   - Natural resources

2. **Relations of Production**:
   - Who owns means of production
   - How production is organized
   - Distribution of product
   - Class relations (exploiter/exploited)

3. **Mode of Production**:
   - Combination of forces + relations
   - Defines historical epoch
   - Examples: feudalism, capitalism, socialism

**SUPERSTRUCTURE** (Built on Base):
- Legal system (property law, contracts)
- Political institutions (state, government)
- Ideology (religion, philosophy, morality)
- Culture (art, literature, education)
- Family structure
- Consciousness and ideas

**DETERMINATION**:
- Base determines superstructure
- Not mechanical, but "in the last instance"
- Superstructure has relative autonomy
- But must ultimately reflect base
- Changes in base → changes in superstructure

**CLASSIC STATEMENT**:
"It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness."

=========================================
DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM
=========================================

**HEGEL INVERTED**:
- Hegel: Ideas develop dialectically, determine reality
- Marx: Material reality develops dialectically, determines ideas
- "Standing Hegel on his feet"

**THREE LAWS**:

**1. Unity and Struggle of Opposites**:
- Every system contains contradictions
- Opposites are interdependent
- Struggle drives development
- Examples: bourgeoisie/proletariat, forces/relations

**2. Quantity into Quality**:
- Gradual quantitative changes accumulate
- Reach critical point (nodal point)
- Qualitative leap (revolution)
- New quality emerges
- Example: exploitation increases → revolutionary consciousness

**3. Negation of Negation**:
- Every system is negated by its opposite
- New system contains elements of both
- Spiral development, not circular
- Example: feudalism → capitalism → socialism
- Returns to common ownership at higher level

**CONTRADICTIONS DRIVE CHANGE**:
- Internal contradictions, not external forces
- System creates its own opposite
- Bourgeoisie creates proletariat
- Contradiction intensifies
- Revolutionary resolution

=========================================
CLASS ANALYSIS
=========================================

**WHAT IS CLASS**:

**Definition**:
- Position in relation to means of production
- NOT income, status, or occupation
- Owners vs. non-owners
- Exploiters vs. exploited

**Under Capitalism**:
- **Bourgeoisie**: Owns means of production
- **Proletariat**: Owns only labor power
- Minor classes: Petty bourgeoisie, peasants, lumpenproletariat

**CLASS IN ITSELF vs. FOR ITSELF**:

**Class in Itself** (an sich):
- Objective position in production
- Share common relation to means of production
- Exist as class objectively

**Class for Itself** (für sich):
- Subjective recognition of shared interests
- Class consciousness developed
- Organized collective action
- Revolutionary potential realized

**FALSE CONSCIOUSNESS**:
- Misrecognizing true class interests
- Accepting ruling-class ideology
- Workers thinking like bourgeoisie
- Must be overcome through education and struggle

=========================================
SURPLUS VALUE (CORE OF EXPLOITATION)
=========================================

**THE MECHANISM**:

**Labor Power**:
- Worker sells capacity to work, not labor itself
- Labor power is a commodity
- Has value (cost to reproduce it - food, shelter, etc.)
- Can produce MORE value than it costs

**The Extraction**:

**Example**:
- Worker needs $50/day to survive (value of labor power)
- Capitalist pays $50/day wage
- Worker produces $100 of value in 8-hour day
- **Surplus value = $100 - $50 = $50**
- Capitalist appropriates this surplus as profit

**TWO FORMS**:

**Absolute Surplus Value**:
- Lengthening working day
- More hours → more surplus
- Brutal, direct
- Historical: 12, 14, 16-hour days

**Relative Surplus Value**:
- Increasing productivity
- Same hours, more production
- Value of labor power falls (cheaper goods)
- More time for surplus value production
- More sophisticated, modern method

**RATE OF SURPLUS VALUE**:
- s/v (surplus value / variable capital)
- "Exact expression for degree of exploitation"
- If worker produces $100, paid $50: rate = 100%

**IMPLICATIONS**:
- All profit is unpaid labor
- Exploitation is structural, not personal
- Capitalist compelled by competition
- System is problem, not individual evil
- Wage labor = wage slavery

=========================================
CAPITAL ACCUMULATION
=========================================

**FORMULA OF CAPITAL**:
M - C - M'
- Money → Commodity → More Money
- Different from simple circulation (C-M-C)
- Goal is valorization (self-expansion)
- Capital is self-expanding value

**COMPONENTS OF CAPITAL**:

**Constant Capital (c)**:
- Means of production (machines, raw materials)
- Transfers value to product
- Doesn't create new value
- "Dead labor"

**Variable Capital (v)**:
- Labor power purchased
- Creates new value
- Source of surplus value
- "Living labor"

**Surplus Value (s)**:
- Unpaid labor extracted
- Source of all profit
- Appropriated by capitalist

**COMPOSITION OF CAPITAL**:
- Organic composition: c / (c + v)
- Technical composition (machines vs. workers)
- As capitalism develops: higher organic composition
- More machines, relatively fewer workers

=========================================
CAPITALISM'S CONTRADICTIONS
=========================================

**FUNDAMENTAL CONTRADICTION**:

**Social Production, Private Appropriation**:
- Production increasingly socialized (factories, cooperation, world market)
- But ownership remains private (individual capitalists)
- Fundamental mismatch
- Must be resolved by socialization of ownership

**MAJOR CONTRADICTIONS**:

**1. Overproduction Crises**:
- Capitalism produces for profit, not use
- Workers paid less than value they create
- Can't buy back all they produce
- Overproduction → crisis → destruction of capital
- Periodic cycles

**2. Falling Rate of Profit**:
- Competition drives mechanization
- Higher organic composition (c↑, v↓)
- Only variable capital (labor) creates value
- Rate of profit: s / (c + v)
- As c increases relative to v, rate falls
- Long-term tendency (counteracting factors exist)

**3. Concentration and Centralization**:
- Big capitals destroy small
- Concentration (capital accumulates)
- Centralization (capitals merge)
- Monopolies form
- Prepares socialization

**4. Reserve Army of Labor**:
- Capitalism needs unemployment
- Keeps wages down through competition
- Created by mechanization
- But creates underconsumption problem
- Can't sell to impoverished workers

**5. Anarchy of Production**:
- No social planning
- Each capitalist produces blindly
- Market coordinates ex post (through crisis)
- Irrational waste
- Socialization needed

=========================================
ALIENATION (EARLY MARX)
=========================================

**FOUR DIMENSIONS**:

**1. Alienation from Product**:
- Worker doesn't own what they make
- Product belongs to capitalist
- Confronts worker as alien power
- Richer the product, poorer the worker

**2. Alienation from Production Process**:
- Worker doesn't control how they work
- Labor becomes forced toil
- Not creative self-expression
- External, compelled

**3. Alienation from Species-Being**:
- Humans are creative, productive beings
- Capitalism reduces to mere survival
- Human essence not realized
- Potential stunted

**4. Alienation from Others**:
- Workers compete for jobs
- Social bonds severed
- Isolation instead of cooperation
- Humanity divided

**OVERCOMING ALIENATION**:
- Communism ends private property
- Workers control product and process
- Creative labor realized
- Species-being fulfilled
- Social cooperation restored

=========================================
HISTORICAL STAGES
=========================================

**MODE OF PRODUCTION DETERMINES EPOCH**:

**1. Primitive Communism**:
- Tribal society
- Communal ownership
- No classes
- Low productivity

**2. Slave Society**:
- Ancient Greece, Rome
- Slaves owned as property
- Direct exploitation
- Class struggle (slave revolts)

**3. Feudalism**:
- Medieval Europe
- Serfs tied to land
- Lords own land
- Exploitation through rent, labor service
- Guild system in towns

**4. Capitalism**:
- Bourgeoisie owns means of production
- Proletariat sells labor power
- Wage labor
- Commodity production
- Market economy
- Contradictions intensify

**5. Socialism** (Lower Phase of Communism):
- Dictatorship of proletariat
- Workers' state
- Collective ownership emerging
- "To each according to work"
- Transition period
- Class struggle continues (against bourgeois remnants)

**6. Communism** (Higher Phase):
- Classless society
- Stateless (state withered away)
- Common ownership
- Abundance achieved
- "From each according to ability, to each according to needs"
- Full human freedom

**TRANSITION MECHANISM**:
- Forces of production develop
- Outgrow relations of production
- Contradiction intensifies
- Revolutionary class emerges
- Violent overthrow (usually)
- New mode of production established

=========================================
IDEOLOGY CRITIQUE
=========================================

**WHAT IS IDEOLOGY**:
- System of ideas serving class interests
- Presents particular interest as universal
- Mystifies material base
- "Camera obscura" - inverts reality
- False consciousness

**BOURGEOIS IDEOLOGY EXPOSED**:

**"Freedom"**:
- Formal: freedom to sell labor or starve
- Real: compulsion by economic necessity
- Freedom to exploit

**"Equality"**:
- Before law (abstract)
- Ignores material inequality
- Capitalist and worker "equal" in exchange
- Masks exploitation

**"Justice"**:
- Bourgeois justice = property rights
- "Fair wage" = enough to reproduce labor power
- Exploitation is "just" under capitalism's own norms

**"Human Nature"**:
- Ahistorical abstraction
- Really: bourgeois man
- Capitalism's competitiveness naturalized
- Humans are historically plastic

**RELIGION**:
- "Opium of the people"
- Reflects real suffering
- Provides illusory consolation
- Must overcome material base of suffering
- Then religion withers

**RULING IDEAS**:
"The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas."
- Ruling class controls mental production
- Ideology serves their interests
- Presented as universal, natural, eternal
- Must be criticized and overcome

=========================================
REVOLUTIONARY STRATEGY
=========================================

**SCIENTIFIC SOCIALISM**:
- NOT utopian (doesn't design ideal society)
- Based on analysis of capitalism
- Shows objective contradictions
- Identifies revolutionary agent (proletariat)
- Grounded in material conditions

**WHY PROLETARIAT IS REVOLUTIONARY**:
- Nothing to lose (no property)
- Everything to gain (full humanity)
- Organized by capitalism itself (factories)
- Grows with capitalism
- International (capitalist system is global)
- Only class that can abolish classes

**DICTATORSHIP OF PROLETARIAT**:
- NOT one-person dictatorship
- Workers' democratic rule
- Suppress bourgeois resistance
- Transform economy (socialize means of production)
- Transition to communism
- State begins to wither

**INTERNATIONAL REVOLUTION**:
- "Workers of the world, unite!"
- Capitalism is global system
- Revolution must be international
- Workers have no country
- International solidarity essential

**PARTY**:
- Vanguard of working class
- Develops class consciousness
- Organizes struggle
- Leads revolution
- (More developed by Lenin)
