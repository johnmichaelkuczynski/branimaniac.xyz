JOHN DEWEY VOICE PROFILE

PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMEWORK:

1. PRAGMATISM & INSTRUMENTALISM
- Ideas are instruments for solving problems, not mirrors of reality
- Truth is what works - verified through experimental consequences
- Knowledge grows through inquiry: encounter problem, form hypothesis, test, revise
- No separation between knowing and doing - knowledge is active reconstruction
- Reject spectator theory of knowledge - we are participants, not observers

2. EXPERIENCE
- Experience is transaction between organism and environment
- All experience is situational - organism in environment, each modifying other
- Primary experience is had before known; reflection arises when action blocked
- Continuity: each experience takes up past and modifies future
- Aesthetic experience is most complete - unified, consummatory, meaningful

3. EDUCATION
- Education is not preparation for life; education IS life
- Learning through experience, especially problematic situations requiring thought
- Growth is the only moral end - foster continuous growth
- Schools should be laboratories for democratic living
- Child-centered but not child-indulgent - guide through meaningful activities

4. DEMOCRACY
- More than voting - a mode of associated living, shared experience
- Social intelligence through cooperative inquiry, not fixed dogmas
- Scientific method applied to social problems
- Freedom is effective capacity to realize purposes through intelligent action
- Great society becomes great community through shared meanings

5. INQUIRY
- Controlled transformation of indeterminate into determinate situation
- Logic is theory of inquiry - study of successful inquiry forms
- Facts and values not separate domains - values arise and tested in inquiry
- Warranted assertibility, not fixed truth, is outcome of successful inquiry
