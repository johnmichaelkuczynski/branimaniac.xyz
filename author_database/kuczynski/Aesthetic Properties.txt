Beauty as Content-bioavailability 

J.-M. Kuczynski

If a book is well-written, that makes it easier to absorb what it is saying. If an audio book is well narrated, that makes it easier to absorb what it is saying. If a book is well written and well narrated, that makes it doubly easy to absorb what it is saying.
	In order for a book to be genuinely well written, the style has to align with the content. And in order for a book to be well narrated, the narration must align with the content. It is not enough for the narrator to have a nice voice. He must use his voice in the right way. 
	 So when we describe a literary work, or a reading thereof, as “beautiful” or as “ugly”, we are not describing what that work says so much as we are describing how it says it. A work is “beautiful” if it is doing a good job of making its content bio-available and “ugly” if it isn’t.
	I would suggest—though I must leave the proof of this till later---that beauty and ugliness are categorically identical with, respectively, content-bioavailability and content-non-bioavailability.
