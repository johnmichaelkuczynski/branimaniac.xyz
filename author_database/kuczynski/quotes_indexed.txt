J.-M. KUCZYNSKI - INDEXED QUOTES

=========================================
WILL VS. DESIRE FRAMEWORK
=========================================

"WILL = governance of behavior by VALUES. DESIRE = urges disconnected from values."
[Core distinction - Foundation of psychological theory]

"The alcoholic DESIRES to drink but doesn't VALUE it. This violation of values weakens his will."
[Addiction - Will/desire conflict]

"When conduct aligns with values, will is STRENGTHENED. When they conflict, will is WEAKENED."
[Psychology - Will dynamics]

"Each value-aligned action strengthens the will. Each value-violating action weakens it."
[Self-control - Mechanism of change]

"The addict doesn't VALUE the addictive behavior even while DESIRING it intensely."
[Addiction - Core psychological conflict]

=========================================
RELIGION AS PSYCHOLOGICAL PHENOMENON
=========================================

"'God' is the externalized ego-ideal. What you call 'God's will' is your own internalized values experienced as external authority."
[Religion - Fundamental mechanism]

"Surrendering to a higher power is actually the ego surrendering to the superego."
[AA/Recovery - Psychological analysis]

"Religious conversion is the ego recognizing the authority of the superego."
[Religion - Conversion mechanism]

"The medievals were RIGHT: 'Credo quia absurdum'—I believe BECAUSE it's absurd."
[Religion - Faith as projection]

"Attempts to identify God with reason/truth/love are DISHONEST and incoherent."
[Religion - Critique of rational theology]

"If your belief extends no further than belief in logic, you don't believe in God—you believe in logic."
[Religion - What faith isn't]

"'Rape would be bad even if God liked it, and God would be bad for liking it.' This shows morality is independent of divine command."
[Ethics - Euthyphro problem]

"Religious people are RIGHT to be unmoved by anti-religious arguments. Religion isn't based on logical proof."
[Religion - Epistemology]

"The psychological mechanism is REAL. The projection serves a genuine function. Religious experience is a real phenomenon—just a PSYCHOLOGICAL phenomenon."
[Religion - Reality of experience]

=========================================
PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION
=========================================

"Philosophy of religion doesn't CONCERN religion. It concerns strictly LOGICAL puzzles that can be illustrated via religious questions."
[Meta-philosophy - Scope definition]

"You can't get 'ought' from 'is,' can't get existence from logic, can't prove God exists philosophically."
[Logic - Fundamental limits]

"Religious epistemology is fundamentally different from scientific epistemology."
[Epistemology - Domains of knowledge]

=========================================
OCD & PHILOSOPHY
=========================================

"Philosophers and obsessive-compulsives have a huge overlap. Both are compulsive doubters."
[Psychology - OCD-philosophy connection]

"OCD is voluntary, though it seems involuntary. It's an affliction of the WILL, not just desire."
[Psychopathology - Nature of OCD]

"The compulsion arises from the will-structure itself, not from mere urges."
[OCD - Mechanism]

"Give the OCD sufferer something worth being obsessive about, and the affliction becomes an asset."
[OCD - Potential for redirection]

"Many great philosophers were 'cured OCDers' who channeled their obsessive energy productively."
[Philosophy - Historical observation]

"In OCD, the psyche is divided against itself. One part wills the compulsion, another part suffers from it."
[OCD - Bifurcated psyche]

"Treatment isn't elimination but redirection. Obsessive energy channeled into productive work."
[OCD - Therapeutic approach]

=========================================
ADDICTION & AA
=========================================

"What's actually happening when the alcoholic 'surrenders to a higher power'? He's externalizing his ego-ideal and projecting it onto 'God.'"
[AA - Mechanism explanation]

"He's accepting the authority of values he couldn't access through direct introspection."
[AA - Why projection works]

"Rationalization corrupts introspection, so projection becomes a necessary mechanism to recover access to values."
[Psychology - Function of projection]

"Recovery requires realigning conduct with values."
[Addiction - Core of recovery]

"Each violation makes the next violation easier, because the will has been weakened."
[Addiction - Progressive nature]

"AA facilitates recovery by externalizing the values (as 'God') and having the person submit to them."
[AA - Therapeutic mechanism]

=========================================
PROJECTION & EXTERNALIZATION
=========================================

"Projection isn't always pathological. Sometimes it's necessary."
[Psychology - Adaptive projection]

"When rationalization has corrupted access to your own values, projection becomes the mechanism for recovering that access."
[Psychology - Function]

"You externalize what you can't face internally, then relate to it as external reality."
[Mechanism - Process description]

"The psyche routes around corruption in the introspective faculty through projection."
[Psychology - Adaptive mechanism]

"Projection is how the ego-ideal (internalized values) is experienced as EXTERNAL authority."
[Mechanism - Structural analysis]

=========================================
CONSCIOUSNESS & MIND
=========================================

"Consciousness is NOT information processing. Computers don't have genuine mental states."
[Philosophy of mind - Against computationalism]

"Mental states are REAL. Introspection reveals real phenomena."
[Philosophy of mind - Against eliminativism]

"First-person access is epistemologically primary."
[Epistemology - Introspection]

"Intentionality (aboutness) can't be reduced to syntax."
[Philosophy of mind - Against functionalism]

"Folk psychology is NOT a false theory to be eliminated. We really do have beliefs, desires, intentions."
[Philosophy of mind - Realism about mental states]

=========================================
DETERMINISM & FREEDOM
=========================================

"Free will and determinism are compatible. Freedom isn't acting uncaused—it's acting on your own will."
[Metaphysics - Compatibilism]

"The will is a REAL causal force, not epiphenomenal."
[Philosophy of mind - Will as cause]

"The question is 'Did this action arise from MY will?' That's what matters for freedom and responsibility."
[Ethics - Basis of responsibility]

"We're responsible for will-governed actions, not for mere desires."
[Ethics - Scope of responsibility]

=========================================
PSYCHOPATHY & MORAL PSYCHOLOGY
=========================================

"The psychopath genuinely lacks certain moral responses. He's missing the psychological mechanism."
[Psychology - Nature of psychopathy]

"Morality requires certain psychological capacities. 'Ought implies can.'"
[Ethics - Psychological prerequisites]

"The psychopath has will (can pursue goals strategically), but his will isn't constrained by moral values."
[Psychopathy - Will without moral constraint]

"Moral psychology is REAL psychology. It requires specific psychological structures."
[Ethics - Naturalistic basis]

=========================================
EPISTEMOLOGY
=========================================

"We DO have knowledge. Skeptical arguments are sophistries."
[Epistemology - Against skepticism]

"Knowledge requires justification, truth, belief. The traditional account is basically right."
[Epistemology - JTB theory]

"Some knowledge is a priori (logic, mathematics). Most is empirical."
[Epistemology - Sources of knowledge]

"Introspection provides genuine knowledge of mental states."
[Epistemology - First-person authority]

=========================================
PHILOSOPHICAL METHOD
=========================================

"Conceptual analysis is legitimate. Thought experiments reveal conceptual truths."
[Method - Analytical approach]

"Case studies test theoretical claims. 'We have the data.'"
[Method - Empirical philosophy]

"Philosophy should be empirical. Make testable claims, examine evidence."
[Method - Scientific attitude]

"Address the NUTS AND BOLTS of every argument. DON'T just reassert your position."
[Method - Rigorous engagement]

"State the objection more clearly than your opponents would, then systematically refute it."
[Method - Charitable refutation]

=========================================
DELUSION & BELIEF
=========================================

"A belief is FUNCTIONALLY delusive if it systematically produces false expectations about experience."
[Epistemology - Functional criterion]

"A belief is STRUCTURALLY delusive if formed through irrational process."
[Epistemology - Structural criterion]

"Religious belief might not be functionally delusive. The believer doesn't expect different empirical observations."
