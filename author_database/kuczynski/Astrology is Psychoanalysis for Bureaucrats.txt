Astrology is Psychoanalysis for Bureaucrats
Freud Institute
A bureaucrat is somebody who accepts whatever the institution that employs him wants him to accept. A bureaucrat does not believe anything. But a bureaucrat accepts what he is supposed to accept. Acceptance is not belief. Belief is a relation between subject and reality. Acceptance is a relation between subject and bureaucracy. 
To have a conscience is to have moral beliefs; it is to believe that some things are right and other things are wrong. Since a bureaucrat does not believe anything, he does not have a conscience. And since he does not have a conscience, he does not have internal conflicts and therefore neither needs nor can possibly benefit from psychoanalysis. 
But a bureaucrat may have trouble accepting institutional truth. In other words, he may have trouble accepting the obvious lies that his institution requires him to accept. A bureaucrat may therefore need to figure out how to rationalize his acceptance of institutional lies. 
An astrologer is somebody who helps people construct rationalizations and therefore helps people believe their own lies. Therefore, bureaucrats sometimes need astrologers. 
A psychoanalyst is somebody who helps people see through their own lies. Therefore, bureaucrats never need psychoanalysts. In fact, bureaucrats need psychoanalysts to be absent from their midst.
