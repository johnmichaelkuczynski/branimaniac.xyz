NORMA: DR. K, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO GIVE ME CLEAR AND

CORRECT ANSWER TO A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE

ABOUT PHILOSOPHY.

 

DR. K: I WILL DO SO. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

 

NORMA JEAN: I SIMPLY WANT DEFINITIONS OF PHILOSOPHICAL

TERMS, STARTING WITH THE TERM ‘PHILOSOPHY’ ITSELF.

 

DR. K: PHILOSOPHY IS THE ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPTS IN

TERMS OF WHICH WE UNDERSATND THE WORLD.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY?

 

DR. K: PHILOSOPHY THAT IS DONE WITH CONSCIOUS

AWARENESS OF WHAT PHILOSOPHY IS.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?

 

DR. K: A FORMAL DECISION PROCEDURE. THE PROCEDURES

LEARNED IN GRADE SCHOOL FOR DOING LONG DIVISION ARE

EXAMPLES OF ALGORITHMS

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A COMPUTATION?

 

DR. K: A CASE OF USING AN ALGORITHM TO SOLVE A

MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM.

 

NORMA JEAN: IS THERE AN ALGORITHM THAT ENABLES US TO

SOLVE ALL MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM?

 

DR. K: NO. THIS IS BECAUSE THE DEVELOPMENT OFALGORITHMS IS ITSELF A MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM, AND

THERE CANNOT BE AN ALGORITHM FOR DEVELOPING

ALGORITHMS.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE?

 

DR. K: KNOWLEDGE THAT IS CONSTITUTIVE OF OUR ABILITY TO

LEARN FROM EXPERIENCE AND THEREFORE IS NOT ITSELF

LEARNED THROUGH EXPERIENCE.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A POSTERIORI KNOWLEDGE?

 

DR. K: KNOWLEDGE THAT IS NOT A PRIORI.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A DATUM?

 

DR. K: SOMETHING KNOWN BUT NOT INFERRED.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS MATERIALISM?

 

DR. K: THE VIEW THAT THE MENTAL IS PHYSICAL.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS ELIMINATIVE MATERIALISM.

 

DR. K: THE VIEW THAT THE MENTAL DOES NOT EXIST.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS INTELLIGENCE?

 

DR. K: THE ABILITY TO MAKE INFERENCES.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS KNOWLEDGE?

 

 

 

 DR. K: A CASE OF KNOWLEDGE IS AN AWARENESS OF A TRUTH

THAT IS THE END-POINT OF A STRUCTURE-PRESERVING CAUSAL

SERIES WHOSE OTHER END-POINT IS THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN

VIRTUE OF WHICH SAID TRUTH HOLDS.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A CONDITIONAL STATEMENT?

 

DR. K: ONE OF THE FORM IF P THE Q, E.G. ‘IF JIM HAS THREE

CARS, THEN JIM HAS MORE THAN ONE CAR’

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS AN ANALYTIC TRUTH?

 

DR. K: ONE THAT HOLDS ENTIRELY IN VIRTUE OF ITS OWN

CONTENT, E.G. NOTHING LITERATE CAN FAIL TO BE SENTIENT.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A FORMAL TRUTH?

 

DR. K: ONE THAT HOLDS ENTIRELY IN VIRTUE OF ITS FORMAL

PROPERTIES, EQUIVALENTLY, ONE WHOSE FORM IS NOT

INSTANTIATED BY ANY FALSEHOOD, E.G. IF GRASS IS GREEN,

THEN EITHER GRASS IS GREEN OR SNOW IS WHITE.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A SYNTEHTIC TRTH?

 

DR. K: ONE THAT IS NOT ANALYTIC, E.G. THE AUTHOR OF THE

PRESENT WORK OWNS A HYUNDAI.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS AN INTERFERENCE EFFECT?

 

DR. K: A DISTURBANCE CREATED BY AN ATTEMPT ON

SOMEONE’S PART TO LEARN ABOUT A GIVEN THING THAT

PREVENTS THAT PERSON FROM LEARNING ABOUT THAT THING.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS FUNCTIONALISM?

 DR. K: THE DOCTRINE THAT THIINGS ARE THE SAME IF THEY

HAVE THE SAME CAUSAL PROPERITES AND OTHERWISE

DIFFERENT.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS THE LAW OF EXCLUDED MIDDLE?

 

DR. K: THE PRINCIPLE THAT ANY GIVEN PROPOSITION IS EITHER

TRUE OR FALSE?

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A PROPOSITION?

 

DR. K: ANYTHING THAT CAN BE AFFIRMED OR DENIED.

EQUIVALENTLY, ANYTHING THAT CAN BE BELIEVED OR

DISBELIEVED.

 

NORMA JEAN: IS ALL AWARENESS AWARENESS OF TRUTHS?

 

DR. K: AWARENESS OF OBJECTS IS NOT AWARENESS OF TRUTHS.

AWARENESS OF A PAIN IN YOUR FOOT IS NOT AWARESS OF A

TRUTH. ONE CAN BE AWARE OF A PAIN WITHOUT KNOWING

THAT ONE IS IN PAIN.

 

NORMA JEAN: HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

 

DR. K: BECAUSE KNOWING A TRUTH INVOLVES

CONCEPTUALIZING OBJECTUAL AWARENESS. TRUTH-

AWARENESS IS THEREFORE SECOND-ORDER AWARENESS,

OBJECTUAL AWARENESSES BEING FIRST-ORDER AWARENESSES.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS LOGICISM?

 

DR. K: THE DOCTRINE THAT TRUTHS OF MATHEMATICS ARE

TRUTHS OF LOGIC.

 

NORMA JEAN: IS LOGICISM TRUE? 

DR. K: NO.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHY NOT?

 

DR. K: BECAUSE THE EQUIVALENCE OF A GIVEN CLASS OF

MATHEMATICAL TRUTHS WITH A GIVEN CLASS OF LOGICAL

TRUTHS COULD BE PROVED ONLY BY ASSUMING TRUTHS OF

MATHEMATICS THAT DID NOT BELONG TO THE SECOND CLASS.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS AN INCOMPLETENESS THEOREM?

 

DR. K: A THEOREM TO THE EFFECT THAT A GIVEN CLASS

CANNOT BE RECURSIVELY DEFINED.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A RECURSIVE DEFINITION?

 

DR. K: A RECURSIVE DEFINITION IS A DEFINITOIN OF A CLASS K

TO THE EFFECT THAT K IS THE SMALLEST CLASS CONTAINING

ALPHA AND ALSO CONTAINING PHI OF X WHENEVER IT

CONTAINS X, FOR SOME OBJECT ALPHA AND SOME RECURSIVE

FUNCTION PHI.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A RECURSIVE FUNCTION?

 

 

DR. K: ONE THAT IS DEFINED FOR EACH OF ITS OWN OUTPUTS,

E.G. F OF X EQUALS X PLUS ONE

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

 

DR. K: A RULE THAT ASSIGNS NO MORE THAN ONE OBJECT TO

ANY GIVEN OBJECT AND ASSIGNS AT LEAST ONE OBJECT TO AT

LEAST ONE OBJECT.

 NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A NUMERICAL FUNCTION?

 

DR. K: ONE THAT ASSIGNS NUMBERS TO NUMBERS, EXAMPLE

ALREAY GIVEN.

 

NORMA JEAN: ARE ALL FUNCTIONS NUMERICAL FUNCTIONS?

 

DR. K: NO. THERE ARE ALSO STATEMNET-FUNCTIONS, A

  STATEMENT-FUNCTION BEING THAT ASSIGNS STATEMENTS TO

STATEMENTS.

 

NORMA JEAN: FOR EXAMPLE?

 

DR. K: THE NEGATION FUNCTION, WHICH ASSIGNS NOT S TO S,

FOR ANY STATEMENT S.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A CONJUNCTION?

 

DR. K: A STATEMENT OF THE FORM P AND Q, E.G. SNOW IS WHITE

AND GRASS IS GREEN.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS CONJUNCTION?

 

DR. K: THE OPERATION OF FORMING A CONJUNCTION OUT OF

TWO STATEMENTS.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS AN OPERATION?

 

DR. K: THE DEPLOYMENT OF A FUNCTION.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS THE CHURCH-TURING THESIS?

 

 

 

 DR. K: THE THESIS THAT THE ANSWER TO A PROBLEM CAN BE

COMPUTER JUST IN CASE THE ANSWER TO IT IS THE OUTPUT OF

A RECURSIVE FUNCTION.

 

NORMA JEAN: IS THE CHURCH-TURING THESIS CORRECT?

 

DR. K: SHORT ANSWER YES. LONG ANSWER, YES, BUT IT IS ALSO

TRIVIAL, GIVEN THAT, FOR ANY CORRECT STATEMENT AND

THEREFORE FOR ANY SOLUTION TO A MAHTEMATICAL

PROBLEM, THERE IS SOME RECURSIVE FUNCTION OF WHICH

THAT STATEMENT IS AN OUTPUT.

 

NORMA JEAN: THANK YOU, DR. K. THAT’S ALL I CAN HANDLE

TODAY. LET’S DO THIS AGAIN TOMORROW.

 

DR. K: DEAL.

                           Analytic Truth vs. Formal Truth

 

 

 

 

MAX: Dr. K, What is an analytic truth?

 

Dr. K: One that holds entirely in virtue of its own content, for example: cubes

are three-dimensional figures.

 

MAX: So a truth is analytic if, given only what it says about the world, it

could not possibly fail to be true.

 

Dr. K: That’s right.

 

MAX: So Dr. K. plays the piano is a non-analytic truth, since, even though it

is true, its content---what it says about the world, in other words---does not by

itself guarantee its truth.

 

Dr. K: Exactly.

 

MAX: And triangles have three sides would be analytic, since, given only

what it says, it could not fail to be true.

 

 

Dr. K: Yes. That is an example, if only a rather trivial one.

 

MAX:  Do you mean that it’s a trivial example of an analytic truth, or that it

is an example of a trivial analytic truth?

 

Dr. K: Both.

 

MAX: How about this? x is a triangle just in case x is a closed, planar,

straight-edged three-sided figure such that any given two of its sides intersect

but not all three of them intersect.

 

Dr. K: Yes, that is an example of a relatively non-trivial analytic truth. 

MAX: So an analytic truth isn’t exactly a definitional truth. An analytic truth

is one that holds entirely in virtue of considerations of logic and meaning.

 

Dr. K: That’s right.

 

MAX: And an analytic truth may therefore be utterly non-trivial.

 

Dr. K: Correct. It sounds as though you have an example in mind.

 

MAX: I do. To wit, there are continuous functions that cannot be

differentiated at any given point.

 

Dr. K: That is indeed analytic, and it is utterly non-trivial.

 

MAX: What is a tautology?

 

Dr. K: A definitional truth.

 

MAX: I see. So ‘a bachelor is an unmarried man’ is a tautology.

 

Dr. K: Correct.

 

MAX: So all tautologies are analytic, but not all analytic truths are

tautologies.

 

Dr. K: Not exactly.

 

MAX: Explain.

 

Dr. K: Take your example: ‘a bachelor is an unmarried man.’ The meaning of

that statement is: The word ‘bachelor’ has the same meaning as the

expression ‘unmarried man.’ Which is not analytic, since it is an empirical

truth about language. 

 

MAX: Please clarify that last point.

 Dr. K: It isn’t a matter of logic that ‘bachelor’ has the same meaning as

‘unmarried man.’ Those expressions could mean anything. It is a matter of

empirical fact, of historical happenstance, that they have the meanings that

they do in fact have.

 

MAX: I see. It is incoherent to deny that triangles have three sides. It is

incoherent---not obviously incoherent, perhaps, but incoherent nonetheless---

to deny that a triangle is a three-sided, straight-edged figure any given two of

whose sides intersect but not all three sides of its intersect. It is incoherent---

not by any means obviously incoherent, surely, but still incoherent---to deny

that there are continuous functions that cannot be differentiated at any point. 

But one could coherently---not correctly, but coherently---deny that

‘bachelor’ has the same meaning as ‘adult unmarried man.’

 

Dr. K: Exactly. That is why ‘a bachelor is an unmarried man’ is an empirical

truth, whereas the others that you mentioned are non-empirical, striclty

analytic truths.

 

MAX: So the old saying that analytic truths are tautologies is wrong.

 

Dr. K: Yes. Very wrong.

 

MAX: Because, in actuality, no analytic truths are tautologies.

 

Dr. K: Correct.

 

MAX: Because a tautology is a definitional truth. It is a definition, or partial

definition, in other words. And definitions hold in virtue of contingent, non-

analytic facts about how words are used.

 

Dr. K: Exactly, if a given word is used in a given way, that is a matter of

brute historical fact. It has nothing to do with analytic relations among

concepts.

 

MAX: Are all mathematicall truths identical with analytic truths?

 

Dr. K: Yes. 

MAX: Are all analytic truths identical with mathematical truths?

 

Dr. K: No.

 

MAX: Explain.

 

Dr. K: Consider the statement

 

(1) all mathematical truths are analytic truths.

 

Question: Is (1) true?

 

MAX: Yes. You just said so.

 

Dr. K: Is (1) analytic?

 

MAX: Yes.

 

Dr. K: Correct. But I would like to hear your reasoning.

 

MAX: 1+1=2 is a truth of mathematics and it is therefore analytic. If it were

an empirical fact that 1+1=2, then (1) would be false. Since (1) is true, it

follows that 1+1=2 is a non-empirical, analytic truth. In general, if a truth is

analytic, it is analytic that it is analytic.

 

Dr. K: Correct. Bearing in mind what you just said, Max, let us once again

consider (1). We have agreed that it is and also that it is analytic.

 

MAX: That’s right. 

 

Dr. K: Right. But is (1) a truth of mathematics?

 

MAX: No. (1) is a truth about mathematics. It is not itself a truth of

mathematics.

 

Dr. K: Exactly. (1) does not belong to mathematics, even though it concernsmathematics.

 

MAX: And even though it follows from a truth of mathematics.

 

Dr. K: That’s right, Max. 

 

MAX: Sir, before we continue, I would like to summarize the argument that

we must went through, to make sure that I really understand it.

 

Dr. K: Good idea. Proceed.

 

MAX: Let (a) be the statement:

 

1+1=2

 

And let (b) be the statement:

 

1+1=2 is analytic.

 

(a) is analytic, and (a) is a truth of mathematics.

(b) is also analytic, but (b) is not a truth of mathematics.

(b) is a philosophical, not a mathematical, statement as to the nature of

mathematical truth.

Any given mathematical truth is analytic. It follows that (1) is analytic, where

(1) is the statement:

 

All mathematical truths are analytic truths

 

But (1) is not itself a truth of mathematics.

 

Dr. K: You stated the argument perfectly.

 

MAX: Good, but I have a question. According to a friend of mine, Kurt

Gödel proved that the truths of mathematics are not analytic. 

 

Dr. K: That is not what Gödel proved. That is the opposite of what he proved,

in fact. But before I tell you why, I would like to hear what else this friend ofyours told you.

 

 

MAX: According to this person, Bertrand Russell and Alfred North

Whitehead tried to prove that all mathematical truths are tautologies, and

Godel proved them wrong.

 

Dr. K: Did this friend of your say anything else?

 

 

MAX: That when people refer to Gödel’s Proof, this is what they are

referring to.

 

Dr. K: Ok. Russell and Whitehead tried to prove that the class of arithmetical

truths is recursively definable. Gödel proved that it is not recursively

definable. Do you know what a recursive definition is?

 

MAX: Yes. First of all, a recursive definition is always a definition of a class.

 

Dr. K. That’s right.

 

MAX: Given a class k, a recursive definition of k is a true statement of the

form

 

alpha belongs to k,

phi of x belongs to k whenever x belongs to k, and

nothing else belongs to k

 

Dr. K: Exactly. Suppose that k is the class of natural numbers. Please

recursively define k.

 

MAX: 0 belongs to k. if n belongs to k, so does n+1. And nothing else

belongs to k.

 

Dr. K: Good.  k is the smallest class containing 0 and containing the

successor of anything that it contains. 

 MAX: I like that way of putting it.

 

Dr. K: Notice that the members of the class of natural numbers can be

arranged in a progression.

 

MAX: You mean, they can be arranged in a discrete series that has a first

member and no last member.

 

Dr. K: Exactly. And this is true of all recursively definable classes.

 

MAX: That makes sense. Given any class k, a recursive definition of k has

the form

 

Alpha belongs to k;

If x belongs to k, then phi of x also belongs to k, and

Nothing else belongs to k.

 

So if we want to arrange the members of k as a progression, we just start with

alpha. Alpha is the first member of the progression, in other words.

Then we put phi of alpha. Which is the second member.

Then we put phi of phi of alpha. Which is the third.

And so on.

And every member of k is somewhere on that list.

 

Dr. K: Exactly. phi is a recursive function if it satisfies the following two

conditons. First, phi is defined for each of its own ouputs. Second, there is

some object x such that x is one of phi’s inputs but x is not one of phi’s

outputs. Do you follow?

 

MAX: Yes. The first condition guarantees that phi of x can be iterated

infinitely many times, and second condition guarantees that the subsequent

series does not loop.

 

Dr. K: Precisely. Now, suppose that k is a statement-class.

 

MAX: You mean, a class that contains statements, as opposed to numbers.

 Dr. K:  Exactly. And suppose that k is recursively defined. Do you follow,

Max? Can you give me an example of a recursively defined statement-class?

 

MAX: Yes. Let k be the smallest class that contains the statement snow is

white and that, whenever it contains a statement, also contains the statement p

and p. in that case, k is the smallest class containing:

 

Snow is white,

Snow is white and snow is white,

Snow is white and snow is white and snow is white,

and so on.

 

Dr. K: Exactly. Now suppose we replace S with some very obvious truth of

arithmetic, such as 1+0=1.

 

MAX: In that case, k is a recursively defined class of arithmetical truths.

 

Dr. K: Right. And what Russell and Whitehead tried to show is that, given

the right choice of S and the right choice of phi, the resulting class contains

every truth of arithmetic.

 

MAX: And this is what Gödel proved to be false.

 

Dr. K: That’s right. He proved that there is no recursive definition of the class

of truths of arithmetic.

 

MAX: So he proved that, for any statement S and any recursive function phi,

at least one truth of arithmetic is absent from the following series:

 

S

phi of S

phi of phi of S

phi of phis of phi of S

And so on

 

Dr. K: Yes. That is exactly what he proved.

 MAX: So he proved that there is no algorithm---no purely formal procedure--

-for generating all of the truths of arithmetic.

 

Dr. K: Correct.

 

MAX: So he proved that there is purely formal characteristic that

distinguishes the truths of arithmetic from other truths.

 

Dr. K: Correct.

 

MAX: But the truths of arithmetic are analytic.

 

MAX: So they are analytic, but they are not formally true.

 

Dr. K: Correct.

 

MAX: So what Gödel proved is that the truths of arithmetic are analytically

true but not formally true.

 

Dr. K: Correct.

 

MAX: So my friend was wrong.

 

Dr. K: Very.

 

MAX: And you will tell me how Gödel proved this?

 

Dr. K: I will. But not now. We have quite a few bridges to cross before we

can discuss the specifics of Gödel’s proof.

 

MAX: What about the non-specifics? What is the general idea? Can you give

me at least a vague idea of what it is that he proved and, possible, of how he

proved?

 

Dr. K: Yes. I can do that. First of all, incompleteness is a property of

statement-sets---of sets of statements, in other words.

 MAX: I follow.

 

Dr. K: And to say that a statement-set is incomplete is to say that there is no

recursive definition of it.

 

MAX:  And to say that a statement-set is complete is to say that there is a

recursive definition of it.

 

Dr. K: Correct.

 

MAX:  So, if k is the set of truths of the form, x is a natural number, then k is

complete, since it is generated by the following recursion:

 

x belongs to k if x = 0;

x belongs to k if y belongs to k and x=y+1;

otherwise, x does not belong to k

 

Dr. K: Spot on.

 

MAX:  But I cannot think of an example of an incomplete statement-set.

 

Dr. K: Most scientifically important statement-sets are incompletely. It is

impossible to axiomatize---in other words, to recursively define---statement-

sets that have any real scope or explanatory power. 

 

MAX:  Could you please give me an example?

 

Dr. K: I will give you the simplest example that I can think. But it is also the

most important example that I can think of, and Godel’s own incompleteness-

theorem, as well as the technique he used  to prove it is based on the theorem

I am about to say.

 

MAX: What is the statement-set in question?

 

Dr. K: The set of all statements of the form x is a real numbe. Let R be that

statement-set. There is no recursive definition of R.

 MAX: I suppose that makes sense. If there were such a statement-set, then

the real numbers could be represented as a discrete series. Since that is not

possible, that statement-set is incomplete.

 

Dr. K: That’s right. But let me state the proof. Once I do so, some interesting

and profound, but also quite counterintuitive, mathematical truths will

become comprehensible to you.

 

MAX:  I am listening with rapt interest, Dr. K!

 

Dr. K: Good. First of all, any real number can be expressed as an infinitely

long series of integers. Thus, the number 1 is identical with

 

point 9 9 9 9 9 9 repeating

 

And the number 2 is identical with:

 

one point 9 9 9 9 9 repeating.

 

And so on.

 

MAX: That’s right.

 

 

Dr. K: Bearing this in mind, let L be a list of real numbers, expressed as

infinitely long series of integers.

 

MAX:  So the first member of L is one infinitely long series of integers; then,

right belong that, there is another such series; and, right below that, is a third

such series. And so on.

 

Dr. K: Exactly. L is a top-down list, and each entry on the list is a real

number, expressed as an infinitely long integer series.

 

MAX: And L is arbitrarily chosen. In other words, L can be as inclusive a list

of real numbers as we want it to be.

 Dr. K: Correct. Are you ready to take the next step, Max?

 

MAX:  Yes.

 

Dr. K: Let D  be a function that does the following. And here you have to

listen very carefully. If the nth figure in the nth member of L is 9, then D

replaces that figure with 1. And if that figure is less than 9, then D adds 1 to

it. Do you follow, Max?

 

MAX:  I think so. Suppose that the first integer in the first member of L is 9.

In that case, D replaces that integer with 1. And suppose that the second

integer in the second member of L is 4. In that case, D replaces that integer

with 5. And if the third integer in the third member of L is 2, then D replaces

that integer with 3. And so on, for each entry on L.

 

Dr. K: Exactly. You will notice that D generates an infinitely long series of

integers.

 

MAX:  Right. If the first integer in the first member of L is n, and n is less

than 9, then the first integer in D of L is n+1. If n equals 9, then D replaces n

with 1.

 

Dr. K: Correct. What about the second member of L?

 

MAX: If n is the second integer in the second member of L, and n is less than

9, then D replaces with n with n+1. If n equals 9, then D replaces n with 1.

 

Dr. K: And the third member?

 

MAX:  If n is the third integer in the third member of L, and n is less than 9,

then D replaces with n with n+1. If n equals 9, then D replaces n with 1.

 

Dr. K: You clearly understand, Max. I am now going to ask you a difficult

question.

 

MAX: I am ready.

 Dr. K: Is D of L itself a member of L? In other words, is D of L one of the

numbers listed on L?

 

MAX: No, it is not. D of L is different from the first entry on L, since the first

integer in the first entry is different from the first integer in D of L. And D of

L is different from the second entry on L, since the second integer in the first

entry is different from the second integer in D of L. And for any number y,

the yth integer in the yth entry on L is different from the yth entry in D of L.

 

Dr. K: Exactly.

 

MAX: Therefore, D of L differs from each of the entries on L, and D of L

therefore does not itself occur on L.

 

Dr. K: Correct.

 

MAX: L is an arbitrary list of real numbers. It could any list of real numbers,

even an infinitely long one. No matter how long we make L, D of L is not on

L.

 

Dr. K: I am going to ask you another question, Max. If a class is recursively

definable, can its members be listed?

 

MAX: Yes. If k is recursively definable, then there exists some object alpha,

and some recursion phi, such that alpha belongs to k and such that, if x

belongs to k, so does phi of x. So we can make a list that contains every

member of k. We put alpha first; and we put phi of alpha second; and we put

phi of phi of alpha third; and so on. And there is no member that does not

occur on this list. 

Dr. K: Precisely. And if there is no way to make a list out of k’s member,

what follows?

 

MAX: That k is not recursively definable.

 

Dr. K: Exactly.

 

MAX: So the class of real numbers is not recursively definable. 

Dr. K: Correct. And the same is therefore of the class of true statements of

the form x is a real number.

 

MAX: I see. So if S is that class, then S is incomplete, meaning that there is

no recursive definition of it.

 

Dr. K: Precisely.

 

MAX: And Godel’s theorem about arithmetic is similar to the

incompleteness-theorem that you just stated.

 

Dr. K: Yes, and his method of proof is based on the technique that we just

used, which is known as diagonalization.

 

MAX: Why is it called that?

 

Dr. K: D of L starts at the top left of L. It replaces the first integer in the first

member of L with some other integers. Then it moves down one entry, and

one decimal place to the right. And it replaces the second integer in the

second entry on L. And so on.

 

MAX: I see. So D of L generates a perfectly diagonal path, from the very top

left of L, that moves downards, and to the right.

 

Dr. K: Correct. Let lambda is some list of objects, and suppose that each of

entries in lambda is itself a list. 

 

MAX: So lambda is just like L. L was a list. And each entry on L was itself a

list, since each entry was a series, and therefore a list, of integers.

 

Dr. K: Precisely. And then define a functoin delta such that, if x is the first

member of the first member of lambda, then delta replaces x with y, where y

is not identical with x; and, if z is the second member of the second member

of lambda, then delta replaces z with w, where w is not identical with z. And

so on, for each of the entries on lambda.

 MAX: In that case, delta generates a list of objects, delta of lambda. And

delta of lambda is not itself on one of the items listed on lambda. 

 

Dr. K: Right.And delta of lambda a diagonalization of lambda.

 

MAX: So suppose somebody says, ‘lambda is a complete list of objects

having property phi.’ And suppose that delta of has phi. In that case, that

person is wrong.

 

Dr. K: And we have proved the incompleteness of lambda by diagonalizaing

on it.

 

MAX: Do all proofs of incompleteness involve diagonalization?

 

Dr. K: No. Godel’s proof uses a very exotic form of it. But the proof I am

about to state, of which Gödel’s proof is a corollary, does not involve

diagonalization.

 

MAX: So you have proved an incompleteness-theorem of your own.

 

Dr. K: Yes.

 

MAX: And that theorem is related to Gödel’s theorem?

 

Dr. K: Yes. Gödel’s theorem follows from it.

 

MAX: But your theorem, as well your proof, are presumably easier to

understand than Gödeltheorem?

 

Dr. K: Yes. Dramatically.

 

MAX: I am all ears, Sir!

 

Dr. K: A logic---a system of logic, in other words---is simply a recursively

defined statement-set.

 

MAX: I think I understand. A logic is the same thing as an axiomatic system,and an  axiomatic system is a recursively defined statement-set.

 

Dr. K: And in other audio, you and I will tell our listeners what an axiomatic

system is.

 

MAX: Agreed.

 

Dr. K: Let me ask you a question, Max. Is the class of all recursively defined

statement-sets itself a recursively defined statement?

 

MAX: I want to make sure I understand the question, Sir. . A logic is by

definition a recursively defined set of statements. So any given logic is, by

definition, recursively defined. But is the class of all logics itself recursively

defined? That is what you are asking, am I right?

 

Dr. K: Yes.

 

MAX: I don’t know the answer to that question, Sir.

 

Dr. K: I will answer it for you, then. Let L1 be an arbitrary logic---an

arbitrarily recursively defined statement-in other words.

 

MAX: Ok.

 

Dr. K: And let S be some statement that does not belong to L1.

 

MAX: Ok.

 

Dr. K: And let L2 the same as L1, except that S is a member of L2.

 

MAX: I see. So S belongs to L2, but not to L1. But otherwise L1 and L2 are

the same.

 

Dr. K: Exactly. Is L2 recursively definable.

 

MAX: Yes. L1 is recursive, by supposition. So it is generated by some

statement of the form: 

sigma belongs to L1, and, if zeta belongs to L1, does phi of zeta.

 

It follows that L2 is generated by the statement:

 

S belongs to L2, and, if zeta belongs to L2, so does psi of zeta,

 

where psi is just like phi, except that psi of S equals sigma.

 

 

Dr. K: Exactly, Max. Exactly. So L2 contains S; and it contains psi of S,

which is sigma, and it contains psi of psi of S; and so on.

 

MAX: So L2 is recursively defined, and so is L1. But the recursion that

generates L1 fails to generate L2.

 

Dr. K: Exactly. And L1 was an arbitrarily chosen statement class.

 

MAX: Ah! So if L1 is supposed, for argument’s sake, to be a recursive

definition of the class of all recursively defined statement-sets, then we can

produce another recursively statement-set, by doing what we just did a

moment ago with S. Which means that L1 is not a recursive definition of the

class of all recursively defined statement-sets.

 

Dr. K: Right. The assumption that there is a recursive definition of the class

of all recursively defined statement-sets self-refutes.

 

MAX: Which means that there is no definition of the class of all recursively

defined statement-sets.

 

Dr. K: Exactly.

 

MAX: Which means that there is no recursive definition of the class of

systems of logic.

 

Dr. K: Correct.

 MAX: Which means that there is no recursive characterization of the concept

of logical truth.

 

Dr. K: Correct.

 

MAX: Which means that the class of truths of logic is incomplete.

 

Dr. K: Correct.

 

MAX: Which would seem to be more general, and perhaps more significant

in other ways, than the fact that the class of arithmetical truths is incomplete.

 

Dr. K: I agree. But we can use the method of proof that we just used, in our

proof of the incompleteness of logic, to prove Gödel’s theorem.

 

MAX: How’s that?

 

Dr. K: Let k be an arbitrary class of arithmetical truths. If we can figure out a

way to identify so much as a single truth of arithmetic that does not belong to

k, then k is incomplete.

 

MAX: Ah! Very good! And since k is arbitrarily chosen---since, in other

words, k is any given class of arithmetical truths---it follows that arithmetic is

incomplete.

 

Dr. K: And that is what Gödel did. He proved that, given any class k of

arithmetical truths, it was possible to construct a truth of arithmetic not

belonging to k.

 

MAX: And I want to hear all about, but I don’t think I can handle any more

information today, Sir.

 

Dr. K: Then let’s adjourn. See you tomorrow,

                                 A Priori Knowledge

 

 

  MAX: Dr. K. What is a priori knowledge?

 

  Dr. K: It is knowledge that is constitutive of one’s ability to reason and to

learn from sensory experience.

 

  MAX: So a priori knowledge is knowledge that enables you to learn from

experience and therefore is not itself acquired through experience.

 

  Dr. K: Correct.

 

  MAX: What proof is there that we have such knowledge?

 

  Dr. K: We couldn’t learn anything from experience, even the the most

rudimentary truth, unless we have such knowledge. Therefore, we have such

knowledge.

 

  MAX: Please clarify.

 

  Dr. K: First of all, for Q to be a consequence of P is for not-Q to be

incompatible with P. Do you follow?

 

  MAX: Yes. x has three sides is a consequence of x is a triangle, because x

does not have three sides is incompatible with x is a triangle.

 

  Dr. K: Precisely. And if you can’t see that certain things follow from

certain things, you can’t learn anything.

 

  MAX: I will grant that provisionally, so as to let you complete your

argument. But I question it.

 

  Dr. K: Very well. Sensory observation apprises you of what is, not of what

isn’t, and certainly not of what cannot possibly be.

 

  MAX: True. 

  Dr. K: Therefore, observation doesn’t apprise you of truths of the form P

is incompatible with Q.

 

  MAX:  Explain.

 

  Dr. K: For P to be incompatible with Q is for it to impossible for P and

not-Q to be jointly actual. Only actualities can be observed. Impossibilities

must be deduced.

 

  MAX: So observation can’t tell you what is incompatible with what.

 

  Dr. K: Therefore, it cannot tell you what follows from what.

 

  Max: Now I see. For Q to be follow from P is for not-Q to be incompatible

with P. So if you don’t what is incompatible with what, you don’t know what

follows from what.

 

  Dr. K: Exactly.

 

  MAX: And if you don’t know what follows from what, you can’t deduce

anything.

 

  Dr. K: That’s right.

 

  MAX: But couldn’t you deduce the relevant principles from sensory

experience?

 

  Dr. K: Because that would itself involve deduction! 

 

  MAX: Ah! I didn’t think of that. But it makes sense. If I can’t deduce

specifics from specifics, then I certainly cannot deduce how to deduce

specifics from specifics…from specifics.

 

  Dr. K: Right. 

 

  MAX: A creature that cannot see bearing relations among specific truthscannot see bearing realtions among bearing relations.  

 

  Dr. K: A creature cannot acquire knowledge of any sort of bearing

relations unless it already has such knowledge.

 

  MAX:  So a creature that doesn’t have such knowledge ab initio cannot

acquire more such knowledge. 

 

  Dr. K. Right. Such a creature could not learn how to reason better, since it

could not reason in the first place. 

 

  MAX: And given that we can learn how to reason better, we have always

been able to do so.

 

  Dr. K: And the deductive knowledge with which we started is what we

call a priori knowledge. Not all deductive knowledge is a priori, obviously,

but all such knowledge presupposes a priori deductive knowledge

 

  MAX: But if these principles are within us---if knowledge of them is

constitutive of our ability to reason---then why do people have to take logic

classes and read logic books to learn about these principles? Why is

knowledge of them---or, at least, conscious knowledge of them such a rare

thing?

 

  Dr. K: The principles of which we have a priori knowledge are not the

objects of thought; they are not what we think about; they are our ability to

think.

 

  MAX: I think I understand. If all of the logic-knowledge that a given

person acquired in college were erased from his mind one day, but that

person were otherwise unaffected, he would still have a mind. He would still

have the ability to reason. In fact, his ability to reason, except in very specific

and artificial domains, would be unaffected.

  But if a given person’s a priori knowledge were erased from his mind,

there would be no mind left. There would be no intellect, certainly, and I

don’t know that there would be much else.

   Dr. K: Exactly. Ordinary knowledge---in other words, knowledge of the

non-a priori variety—is a relation between the subject, on the one hand, and

the truth known, on the other. A priori knowledge is not such a relation; for

without such knowledge, the subject isn’t there to begin with.

 

  MAX: So a priori knowledge is impersonal?

 

  Dr. K: Chomsky uses the term subpersonal. But, yes, it would appear so.

 

  MAX: So there is a knower but no known.

 

  Dr. K: That would seem to follow.

 

  MAX: And you don’t find that perplexing?

 

  Dr. K: I do find it perplexing.

 

  MAX: But you’re convinced you’ll sort it out.

 

  Dr. K: I am. I think that’s enough for one session, Max.

 

  MAX: See you tomorrow, Dr. K.

 

 

                       PHILOSOPHY DIALOGUE PART 2

 

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS DETRMINISM?

 

DR. K: THE DOCTRINE THAT THE STATE OF THE UNIVERSE AT

ANY GIVEN TIME FIXES THE STATE OF THE UNIVERSE AT ALL

LATER TIMES.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A COUNTERFACTUAL?

 

DR. K: A COUNTERFACTUAL IS A STATEMENT OF THE FORM ‘IF P

WERE THE CASE, THEN Q WOULD ALSO BE THE CASE’, FOR

EXAMPLE, ‘IF SMITH HAD FALLEN OFF THE LEDGE, SMITH

WOULD HAVE BROKEN HIS LEG.’

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A BACK-TRACKING COUNTERFACTUAL?

 

DR. K: A BACK-TRACKING COUNTERFACTUAL IS A

COUNTERFACTUAL TO THE EFFECT THAT IF SUCH AND SUCH

WRE NOW THE CASE, THEN THUS AND WOULD HAVE BEEN THE

CASE IN THE PAST, FOR EXAMPLE, ‘IF SMITH WERE NOW ALIVE,

HE WOULD NOT HAVE FALLEN OFF THE LEDGE.’

 

NORMA JEAN: WHEN LOGICIANS REFER TO ‘COMPLETENESS’,

WHAT THEY ARE REFERRING TO?

 

DR. K: COMPLETENESS IS A PROPERTY OF STATEMENT-SETS. TO

SAY THAT A STATEMENT-SET IS ‘COMPLETE’ IS TO SAY THAT IT

IS RECURSIVELY DEFINABLE. LET K BE THE CLASS OF TRUE

STTEMENTS OF THE FORM ‘N IS A NATURAL NUMBER’. K IS

COMPLETE, SINCE IT IS GIVEN BY THE FOLLOWING RECURSION:

A STATEMENT S BELONGS TO K JUST IN CASE EITHER

S IS THE STATEMENT ‘0 IS A NATURAL NUMBER’

OR, FOR SOME NATURAL NUMBER X,S IS THE STATEMENT ‘X+1 BELONGS TO K’

 

NORMA JEAN: AND AN INCOMPLETE STATEMENT-SET IS ONE

THAT IS NOT RECURSIVELY DEFINABLE?

 

DR. K: YES.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS AN EXAMPE OF SUCH A SET?

 

DR. K: LET K BE THE CLASS OF TRUE STATEMENTS OF THE FORM

‘X IS A REAL NUMBER.’ THERE IS NO RECURSIVE DEFINITION OF

K. THIS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO

RECURSIVE DEFINITION OF THE CLASS OF REAL NUMBMERS.

THE REASON WHY THERE IS NO SUCH DEFINITION IS STATED IN

MY BOOK ‘PAPERS ON FORMAL LOGIC.’

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS VIRTUE THEORY?

 

DR. K: VIRTUE THEORY IS THE DOCTRINE THAT THERE IS NO

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEHAVING ETHICALLY AND BEHAVING

SELF-INTERESTEDLY, THE REASON BEING THAT IGNOMONIOUS

BEHAVIOR IS COWARDLY AND THEREFORE SELF-UNDERMIING

AND, CONTRAWISE, THAT GENUINELY SELF-INTERESTED

BEHAVIOR IS NOT IGNOMINOUS

 

NORMA JEAN: BASICALLY, TRUE STRENGH INVOLVES A

COINCIDENCE OF SELF-RESPECT AND RESPECT FOR OTHERS.

 

DR. K:  RIGHT. THE IDEA BEHIND VIRTUE THEORY IS THAT ONE

CANNOT GENUINELY RESPECT OTHERS WITHOUT RESPECT

ONESELF AND ONE CANNOT GENUINELY RESPECT ONESELF

WITHOUT REPSECT OTHERS.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS VERIFICATIONISM?

 DR. K: THE DOCTRINE THAT A STATEMENT IS MEANINGFUL JUST

IN CASE IT IS CAPABLE OF BEING DEFINITIVELY VERIFIED

SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF SENSORY DATA.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS FALSIFICATIONISM?

 

DR. K: THE DOCTRINE THAT A STATEMENT IS MEANINGFUL JUST

IN CASE ITS NEGATION IS CAPABLE OF BEING DEFINITIVELY

VERIFIED SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF SENSORY DATA.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A UNIVERSAL GENERALIZATION?

 

DR. K: A STATEMENT OF THE FORM ‘ALL F’S ARE G’S’, FOR

EXAMPLE, ‘ALL BIRDS HAVE FEATHERS’

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS AN EXISTENTIAL GENERALIZATION?

 

DR. K: A STATEMENT OF THE FORM ‘SOME F’S ARE G’S’, FOR

EXAMPLE, ‘SOME ANIMALS HAVE FEATHERS.’

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A QUANTIFIED GENERALIZATION?

 

DR. K: A STATEMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT TWO CLASSES

OVERLAP BY A CERTAIN AMOUNT. THUS, ‘MOST PEOPLE ARE

GOOD’ IS A QUANTIFIED GENERALIZATION, AND SO IS ‘NO

PEOPLE ARE GOOD’, AND SO IS ‘THREE PEOPLE ARE GOOD’, AND

SO IS ‘ALL PEOPLE ARE GOOD’, ETC.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A SENTENTIAL FUNCTION?

 

DR. K: AN EXPRESSION THAT CONTAINS A FREE VARIABLE, AND

IS THEREFORE NEITHER TRUE NOR FALSE, BUT IS OTHERWISE

JUST LIKE A SENTENCE, FOR EXAMPLE ‘X IS TALL’ OR ‘X IS AN

EVEN NUMBER.’

 NORMA JEAN: WHY ARE SUCH EXPRESSIONS CALLED

SENTENTIAL FUNCTIONS?

 

DR. K: BECAUSE THEY CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS FUNCTIONS

WHOSE OUTPUTS ARE SENTENCES. ‘X IS AN EVEN NUMBER’

CORRESPONDS TO A FUNCTION THAT, WHEN GIVEN THE TERM

‘2’ IS INPUT, PRODUCES THE SENTENCE ‘2 IS AN EVEN NUMBER’

AS OUTPUT.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A SENTENTIAL OPERATOR?

 

DR. K: AN EXPRESSION THAT, WHEN TAKES SENTENCES OR

OPEN-SENTENCES AS INPUTS AND SENTENCES AS OUTPUTS. FOR

EXAMPLE, ‘JOHN BELIEVES THAT’ IS A SENTENTIAL OPERATOR,

SINCE, WHEN GIVEN ‘SNOW IS WHITE’ AS INPUT, YIELDS ‘JOHN

BELIEVES THAT SNOW IS WHITE’ AS OUTPUT.

 

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS A QUANTIFIER?

 

DR. K: AN EXPRESSION THAT, WHEN GIVEN TWO OPEN

SENTENCES, YIELDS A SENTENCE TO THE EFFECT THAT THE

CLASS OF OBJECTS SATISFYING THE CONDITION EXPRESSED BY

THE FIRST OPEN SENTENCE OVERLAPS BY A CERTAIN AMOUNT

WITH THE CLASS OF OBJECTS SATISFYING THE CONDITION

EXPRESSED BY THE SECOND OPEN SENTENCE.

 

NORMA JEAN: PLEASE EXPLAIN.

 

DR. K: CONSIDER THE OPEN SENTENCE ‘X IS AN EVEN NUMBER

GREATER THAN 0 AND LESS THAN 12’. THAT OPEN SENTENCE

EXPRESSES A CONDITION. 2 SATISFIES THAT CONDITION, SO

DOES 4, AND SO DO 4, 6, 8, AND 10. SO THE CLASS OF OBJECTS

SATISFYING THAT CONDITION IS 2, 4, 6, 8, AND 10. EVERY OPEN

SENTENCE DEFINES A CONDITION AND THEREFORE DEFINES A

CLASS. IF NOTHING SATISFIES THE CONDITION IN QUESTION,THE CLASS IS EMPTY.

 

NORMA JEAN: SO ‘X IS A SQUARE CIRCLE’ CORRESPONDS TO

THE EMPTY CLASS.

 

DR. K: EXACTLY. THAT OPEN SENTENCE EXPRESSES A

CONDITION. NOTHING SATISFIES THAT CONDITION. SO THAT

CONDITION GENERATES THE EMPTY SET.

 

NORMA JEAN: I SEE.

 

DR. K: CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING TWO OPEN SENTENCES: X IS A

BALD PERSON AND X SMOKES. OBVIOUSLY THOSE TWO

CLASSES EITHER OVERLAP OR THEY DON’T. IF THEY DON’T,

THEN THE RIGHT THING TO SAY IS: NO BALD PERSON SMOKES

OR, STATED FORMALLY, FOR NO X, X IS A BALD PERSON AND X

SMOKES.

 

NORMA JEAN: SO THE SENTENCE ‘NO BALD PERSON SMOKES’ IS

AN ENCRYPTED WAY SAYING ‘FOR NO X, X IS A BALD PERSON

AND X SMOKES.’

 

DR. K: EXACTLY. THE SECOND SENTENCE EXPLICITLY CONTAINS

THE TWO OPEN SENTENCES THAT THE FIRST SENTENCES ONLY

IMPLICITLY CONTAINS.

 

NORMA JEAN: I SEE. AND BY PUTTING THE EXPRESSION ‘FOR NO

X’ IN FRONT OF THOSE TWO OPEN SENTENCES, ONE FORMS A

SENTENCE TO THE EFFECT THAT THOSE TWO CLASSES DO NOT

OVERLAP.

 

DR. K: EXACTLY. AND IF ONE SAYS ‘FOR THREE X, X IS A BALD

PERSON AND X SMOKES’, ONE SAYS THAT THERE ARE THREE

OBJECTS THAT BELONG TO BOTH CLASSES.

 NORMA JEAN: I SEE. 

 

DR. K: AND IF ONE SAYS ‘FOR SOME X, X IS A BALD PERSON AND

X SMOKES’ ONE IS SAYING THAT THOSE TWO CLASSES HAVE A

NON-NULL, BUT OTHERWISE INDETERMINATE, AREA OF

OVERLAP.

 

NORMA JEAN: SO ‘FOR SOME X’, ‘FOR THREE X’, ‘FOR NO X’ ETC.

ARE QUANTIFIERS

 

DR. K: EXACTLY. AND THEY ARE ARTIFICIAL ANALOGUES OF

‘SOME’, ‘THREE’, AND ‘NO’.

 

NORMA JEAN: SO ‘SOME’, ‘THREE’, AND ‘NO’ ARE QUANTIFIERS?

 

DR. K: YES.

 

NORMA JEAN: AND, BY PARITY OF REASONING, SO ARE ‘MOST’,

‘ALL’, AND ‘MANY’.

 

DR. K: CORRECT.

 

NORMA JEAN: THAT’S ALL I CAN HANDLE, DR. K

 

DR. K: SEE YOU TOMORROW NORMA JEAN.

 

 

 

 

                                 Honesty and Integrity

 

 

  MAX: Professor, you hold that morality and self-interest coincide, is that

right?

 

  Dr. K: Yes, give or take a few nuances.

 

  MAX: But that’s obviously false. If I come across a brief case full of

money lying in the middle of the street and I’m desperately short on cash, I

have an ethical duty to turn that briefcase into the police, but it would

obviously be in my self-interest to keep the money.

 

  Dr. K: I agree. And if I were in that situation, I would keep the money. In

fact, I’d keep it even if I weren’t short on cash.

 

  MAX: How do you reconcile that with your position?

 

  Dr. K: My position is that a life of integrity is a good life and that a life

without it is not. Obviously specific situations will arise in which, for the

sake of one’s own welfare, must violate some canon of ethics. But a life that

was based on fraud would not be a good life, and a life that is not based on a

fraud is necessarily consistent with some ethical code.

 

  MAX: Some ethical code? How many are there?

 

  Dr. K: Many.

 

  MAX: So you are a moral relativist?

 

  Dr. K: I am not.

 

  MAX: Explain.

 

  Dr. K: Ethics is about integrity. What a shark must do to retain its integrity

is not the same as what a lamb must do to retain its integrity.

   MAX: I believe Mao made a similar point.

 

  Dr. K: Yes, he did. Anyway, what a given creature must do to retain, or to

augment, its integrity is fixed by its biological and psychological endowment.

 

  MAX: By its psycho-biological endowment.

 

  Dr. K: Yes. If a given creature has a given psycho-biological architecture,

that is a matter of objective fact. 

 

  MAX: I think I see where you’re going. Biology varies from creature to

creature, and, within limits, from person to person; and the same is true of

psychology, since a person’s psychology is really an aspect of his biology.

 

  Dr. K: That’s the idea. Continue.

 

  MAX: And what it is incumbent on a creature to do in order to survive or

a fortiori to flourish is therefore fixed by its biology. Am I on track, Sir?

 

  Dr. K: You are. Continue.

 

  MAX: Therefore, what a creature must do in order to live coherently is

fixed by its psycho-biological architecture.

 

  Dr. K: Correct. Keep going.

 

  MAX: So psychology and biology vary from to species to species, and to a

lesser from individual to individual, and in that sense they are ‘subjective.’

But it is not a matter of opinion, but of objective, scientific fact, how a

creature’s mind and body are configured. And in that sense biology and

psychology are objective. Am I still on track?

 

  Dr. K: Yes. Close the argument.

 

  MAX: The imperatives of morality are conditional truths of the form: if a

creature has constitution X, then it must do Y in order to preserve and

consolidate its psycho-biological architecture.  Therefore, even though theimperatives of morality are variable, in the sense that two creature don’t

necessarily have the same obligations, that is only because biology is

variable, and moral facts must therefore be as variable as biological facts if

they are to keep pace with them.

 

  Dr. K: Well stated.

 

  MAX: Sir, I grant that what a creature must do to be healthy and flourish

is fixed by objective facts about its psycho-biological structure. But it doesn’t

follow that morality and self-interest coincide.

 

  Dr. K: Yes it does.

 

  MAX: No it doesn’t, sir, unless it is granted that one’s only moral

obligation is to be healthy and flourish.

 

  Dr. K: Don’t you have an obligation to be healthy and flourish?

 

  MAX: That is obviously one of my moral obligations, but it is not the only

one.

 

  Dr. K: What other ones do you have?

 

  MAX: I have an obligation to be nice to other people.

 

  Dr. K: Even if it means undermining your own welfare? Your own health?

 

  MAX: That’s a good point. But still.

 

  Dr. K: Still what?

 

  MAX: I have an obligation to keep promises, to be honest with people, at

least within reason, to take responsibility for my own actions, and not to

damage the environment or to undermine institutions on which others

depend.

 

  Dr. K: I agree. You do have such obligations. 

  MAX: But that means that I have moral obligations other than to be

healthy and flourish..

 

  Dr. K: If you never took responsibility for your own actions, would your

psyche retain its integrity? 

 

  MAX: Please clarify the question.

 

  Dr. K: If you never took responsibility for your actions, would you retain

your psychological integrity? I am not referring to moral integrity. I am

talking about your psychological architecture.

 

  MAX: If I lied to myself about what I had done, if I always rationalized

away my own failures, then, no, I would not retain my psychological

integrity. I would live in a bubble of psychosis.

 

  Dr. K: Right. If you always let yourself off the hook, if you didn’t admit

that it was your responsibility to right-size yourself with respect to the

mechanisms that govern the world, then you’d always be on the wrong side

of those mechanisms. And you’d be impotent, unable to change the external

world or, therefore, yourself.

 

  MAX: Granted, Professor. If you always rationalized---if you never

copped to your own failures and forced yourself to improve, so that you

would not repeat those failures---you would disintegrate into a condition of

utter impotence, and possibly of psychotic isolation from reality.

 

  Dr. K: Exactly.

 

  MAX: That shows that being honest with oneself is necessary for a good

life. It doesn’t show that being honest with others is necessary for it.

 

  Dr. K: Are you sure about that?

 

  MAX: Yes, unless it could be proved that being honest with oneself

involved being honest with others---unless that could be established, then,yes, I am sure that having a good life doesn’t involve being honest with

others.

 

  Dr. K: And you believe that one can be dishonest with others and honest

with oneself?

 

  MAX: I believe that one can lie to others without lying to oneself. Yes.

That is what I believe.

 

  Dr. K: It sounds as though you don’t believe it.

  MAX: I have my doubts, I will admit.

 

  Dr. K: Explain.

 

  MAX: The people I’ve known who were pathological liars were never

honest with oneselves. No matter how egregiously they failed----and fail they

did, all of them, all them time, in the worst possible---no matter how badly

they failed, they could rationalize their failure to themselves. They could, and

they did.

 

  Dr. K: So people who lie to others lie to themselves.

 

  MAX: Right. And vice versa.

 

  Dr. K: Explain.

 

  MAX: If someone always rationalizes, if he always lies to himself, as it

suits him, as these pathological liars did, then he has no reason not to lie to

others. After all, if such a person gets stuck in a lie, they can just do more

rationalizing. For rationalizers, it’s all about what is convenient at that exact

time, in that exact context. Everything else is up for grabs. For such people,

where there isn’t an immediate, tangible reason to behave in a certain way,

there is no reason of any kind to behave in that way.

 

  Dr. K: So you agree with me, then.

 

  MAX: Please clarify. 

  Dr. K: You hold that honesty with oneself is necessary for a good life.

 

  MAX: I do.

 

  Dr. K: You hold that honesty with others is necessary for honesty with

oneself.

 

  MAX: I do.

 

  Dr. K: Therefore, you hold that honesty with others is necessary for a

good life.

 

  MAX: Very clever, Professor. But here’s where I don’t agree with you. I

grant that, given how it is that human beings are configured, it is not possible

to lie habitually without to some extent believing one’s own lies. And I grant

that people who believe their own lies implode psychologically. So, yes, I do

grant that, human psychology being what it is, a modicum of honesty with

others is a prerequisite for mental health and, therefore, for a good life. Yes, I

grant all of that. But…

 

  Dr. K: But what?

 

  MAX: But that seems to be a contingent fact about human beings. There

could exist creatures that did not have to be honest with others in order to be

honest with themselves. So, yes, I grant that, where human beings are

concerned, a certain degree of honesty with others is necessary for mental

health and personal welfare, I don’t see why this hold universally. I see it as

holding only for creatures of a certain psychological configuration.

 

  Dr. K: But didn’t we agree that what it is incumbent on a given creature to

do is determined by its psychological configuration?

 

  MAX: We did. 

 

  Dr. K: Didn’t we agree that what it is ethically incumbent on a shark to do

is different from what it is ethically incumbent on a lamb to do. 

  MAX: Yes, we did.

 

  Dr. K: I am not seeing where we disagree.

 

  MAX: I’ll tell you where, sir. Let’s suppose that there there exist creatures

of this kind, creatures that are configured in such a way that they can be

dishonest with us while be honest with themselves. 

 

  Dr. K: High IQ sharks, in other words. Predators.

 

  MAX: Exactly. So these walking, talking sharks could be dishonest with

us, and it wouldn’t hurt them in the least.

 

  Dr. K: Agreed.

 

  MAX: But they would have a moral obligation to be honest with us.

 

  Dr. K: I don’t know that they would. If cats could talk with mice, would

cats have a moral obligation to be honest with mice?

 

  MAX: Good point.

 

  Dr. K: And human beings do lie to animals. Not verbally, of course. But

they lay traps for them and mislead them in all sorts of ways.

 

  MAX: That’s true.

 

  Dr. K: Do you think that a human being who lives by hunting animals has

an obligation to be honest with those animals about where he has laid his

traps?

 

  MAX: No, I suppose not.  

 

  Dr. K: Let me ask you another question, Max. When humans deceive

animals in this way, are they also deceiving themselves? Is a person who uses

trickery to catch his prey in the same category as a person who lies to anotherperson? 

 

  MAX: No, they are in very different categories, in many ways.  A human

who lies to others lacks integrity, but a human who uses trickery to catch his

dinner might be integrity personifed.

 

  Dr. K: Right. Let’s think about these hypothetical aliens of yours, these

high IQ sharks, who can walk and talk. Let’s suppose that they predate on us,

just as cheetahs predate on gazelles, and that, to that end, they lie to us.

 

  MAX: I’m with you.

 

  Dr. K: Would these shark-beings have a moral obligation to be honest

with us?

 

  MAX: That’s not clear, but, I grant, any such obligation they might have

would be far more tenuous than a person’s obligation to be moral with other

people.

 

  Dr. K: Exactly. And let me ask you another question: do you have moral

obligations to insects? 

 

  MAX: Not really. I mean, maybe, but, if so, those obligations are weak

ones.

 

  Dr. K: What about rodents?

 

  MAX: I would say that my moral obligations towards rodents are stronger

than my moral obligations towards insects, but they are definitely weaker

than my moral obligations towards people.

 

  Dr. K: What about oranutans, dolphins, and whales? Do you have moral

obligations towards them?

 

  MAX: My obligations towards them are weaker than my moral obligations

towards other people but stronger than my obligations towards rodents, and

far stronger than my obligations towards insects. 

  Dr. K: What about people in other countries? In countries that you will

never visit?

 

  MAX: I have moral obligations towards the people in those countries.

 

  Dr. K: Are they as strong as the moral obligations that you have towards

your fellow citizens?

 

  MAX: I suppose not.

 

  Dr. K: And what about your obligations towards immediate family

members? Are those obligations stronger than those towards somebody in

some remote part of the country, with whom you have no connection, apart

from the fact that he is a fellow citizen?

 

  MAX: Yes, of course. I mean, I do have moral obligations towards all

fellow citizens and towards all human beings. But obviously my obligations

towards some people are stronger than my obligations towards others. And

my obligations towards immediately family and close friends are the

strongest moral obligations that I have, with the possible exception my moral

obligations towards myself.

 

  Dr. K: Do you see the principle implicit in all this?

 

  MAX: I think so. The more some other creature’s being is confluent with

one’s own, the more one has moral obligations towards that being.

 

  Dr. K: Exactly.

 

  MAX: Professor, a moment ago, we were talking about walking, talking

sharks---about predators who could walk and talk and transact with us, but

whose psychological configurations permitted them to lie to us without lie to

themselves. It occurs to me that such creatures exist.

 

  Dr. K: Explain.

   MAX: Some human beings are predators. Admittedly, many human

predators are damaged and deranged misfits. Predators of that sort tend to

live pretty miserable lives, so they aren’t a counter-example to your thesis

that morality and self-interest coalesce. But I don’t know that all human

predators fall into this category. 

 

  Dr. K: Elaborate.

 

  MAX: I have read a lot of books about the Mafia, the Italian-American

Mafia. A lot of those books were written by mafiosos themselves, the most

famous example being Wiseguy, which the movie Goodfellas is based on.

Anyway, there have been a lot of these books, and I’ve read most of them.

And the story is always the same. The mafioso writing the book throws in a

sentence or two about how terrible life in the mafia was, but the feeling I get

is that they enjoyed it. And whenever one of these mafiosos recounts his

exploits, he does so with glee. Not only is there not the slightest tinge or

regret: they always talks about their capers---their, oftentimes, phenomenally

vicious crimes---with glee, and pride.

 

  Dr. K: This is interesting. Continue.

 

  MAX: And the thing is, their lives as mafiosos were incredibly brutal.

What they had to deal with, from the law, and also from other mafiosos, was

unspeakable. But unless they were either facing a very long jail sentence---20

years or more---or they knew, with certainty, that some other mafioso was

going to succeed in killing them, they didn’t even consisder leaving the

mafia. And, most importantly, these ex-mafiosos always seemed rather

chipper.

 

  Dr. K: They are chipper. I knew a couple. Unless they were on trial, they

were upbeat and jolly.

 

  MAX: That confirms what I’m about to say.  Their lives were about

deception. For them, deception was not just a means to end. It seemed to be

an end unto itself. But---when they weren’t in jail or otherwise in some

objectively bad situation---they seemed to be authentically happy. And I

don’t see how that is consistent with your thesis. 

  Dr. K: Actually, it is consistent with it. Do you know what omertá is?

 

  MAX: Yes, it’s the oath of loyaly a mobster takes when he is being

formally inducted into the mafia.

 

  Dr. K: And what is that oath exactly?

 

  MAX: You sware to be loyal to other members of your crime family. You

sware not to talk to law enforcement. You sware not to strike them. You

sware not to sleep with their wives. You sware to give a certain percentage of

your earnings to your capo. And so on.  

 

  Dr. K: Right. The upshot is that one mafioso has to behave with

unremitting integrity towards other mafiosos, except when it’s necessary to

sacrifice a given mafioso to save the family.

 

  MAX: I think I see where you are going with all this, but if you could be a

little more explicit, that would help.

 

  Dr. K: Mafiosos are indeed untterly evil towards non-mafiosos; and they

can be evil towards other mafiosos without themselves becoming

rationalizing basketcases, like the pathological liars you described earlier. But

that is only because they constitute a relatively self-contained community. An

ordinary person does not have a tight knit community of confederates on

whom he can rely, at least not in anything like the way a mafioso can rely on

his fellow mafiosos. An ordinary person’s dependencies are dispersed over a

vast cultural, social, legal, and political landscapes. And an ordinary person’s

moral obligations are also dispersed over the same landscapes.

 

  MAX: I think I understand. Moral obligations track prudential ties.

Morality tracks practicality.

 

  Dr. K: Well stated. The mafioso has deliberately structured his life in such

a way as to concentrate all of his prudential ties into tightly a circumscribed

and well defined community.  

   MAX: I see. That’s why a mafioso can lie to non-mafiosos without lying

to himself.   

 

  Dr. K: Exactly. But if a mafioso’s relationship to fellow mafiosos is

fundamentally dishonest---if his relationship to them parallels that of a

pathological liar to society, then, setting aside the fact that such a mafioso

probably wouldn’t live long, it seems to me that his life would be incoherent

in much the same as that of one of these pathological lair acquaintances of

yours.

 

  MAX: That mafioso would be a ‘weasel’ or a ‘rat’, or some such.

 

  Dr. K: That sounds right.

 

  MAX: And his lies to his fellow mafia members would deplete him in

much the way an ordinary person’s lies to other human beings deplete him.

 

  Dr. K: Well stated.

 

  MAX: So even though there is a superficial, technical sense in which any

given mafioso lies to other mafiosos, there is a deeper and more significant

sense in which a certain honesty and truthfulness must form the core of a

given mafioso’s relations to that other mafiosi if that mafioso is to continue to

be a ‘Man of Honor’; if, in other words, he is to continue to have that very

particular---that very narrowly defined but unmistakeably real---decency that

characterizes the mafioso who, by mafia standards, is a man of stature and

gravitas.

 

  Dr. K: Well put. 

 

  MAX: Something occurred to me, Dr. K.

 

  Dr. K: What’s that?

  MAX: Suppose some explorers came across an isolated tribe of people in

some jungle. If a given one of those tribesman was hostile to those explorers

while being honest and decent with his fellow tribesman, we would not

regard him as lacking integrity. But if a given tribesman were more decent tothe explorers than to his fellow tribesman---if he simply jettisoned all of his

ties to his tribesman in order to cozy up to the explorers—we would regard

him as lacking integrity. In fact, we’d see him as positively psychopathic.

 

  Dr. K: Exactly. And it wouldn’t be until, and unless, those tribesman

developed deeply entrenched relations of mutual dependency with the

explorers that we would expect them to treat the explorers in the same way

that they treated each other. And until that point we wouldn’ t see such

behavior as justified.

 

  MAX: Professor, I think you have made a case that some kind of morality

is confluent with some some kind of self-interest. But I still think it’s going a

bit far to say that morality categorically coincides with self-interest.

 

  Dr. K: I agree that, given only what has been said thus far, it remains open

to what extent the two coincide.

 

  MAX: Sir, I don’t think I can handle any more information today. Do you

think we take a break and resume this discussion later?

 

  Dr. K: Yes. But it won’t just be one conversation; it will be many. There is

a lot to cover.

 

  MAX: Actually, there is one thing I’d like clear up before we adjourn.

 

  Dr. K: What is that?

 

  MAX: You said that if you found a briefcase full of money, you’d keep it,

rather than turn it into the police. How do you reconcile that with your

contention and morality and self-interest coincide?

 

  Dr. K: Honesty is one thing, compulsive truthfulness is another. And

somewhere in that distinctdion is the answer to your question. But the

particulars are best left for another time.

 

  MAX: I think I understand the distinction. There is a kind of pettry

truthfulness----a punctilliousness about details and little facts---that is not thesame thing as true honest but which is often mistaken with true honesty.

 

  Dr. K: Correct:

 

  MAX: And may even be used as away of being fundementally dishonest.

 

  Dr. K: Interesting. Explain.

 

  MAX: Truthfulness about little things is often used to deflect attention

away from big things, and I’ve known many a complete sociopath who was a

stickler for little facts and used this micro-truthfulness to misrepresent big

facts.

 

  Dr. K: Micro-honesty pressed into the service of macro-dishonesty.

 

  MAX: So whereas micro-honesty is truthfulness about little facts, macro-

honesty is truthfulness about the realities meant by those facts. And true

honesty is macro-honesty. 

 

  Dr. K: Exactly. 

 

  MAX: And your returning the briefcase would fall into the category of

micro-dishonesty that is not macro-dishonesty, is that the idea?

 

  Dr. K: Yes.

 

  MAX: But surely macro-honesty involves micro-honesty?

 

  Dr. K: Yes it does.

 

  MAX: Ok. And that would explain why being micro-honest is such an

effective of being macro-dishonest.

 

  Dr. K: Explain.

 

  MAX: Since honesty about big things tends to involve honesty about little

things, and since the sort of people who are honest about big things tend alsoto be truthful about little things, there is a presumtion to the effective that any

case of micro-honesty is a case of macro-honesty.

 

  Dr. K: That sounds right.

 

  MAX: But there are a lot of little facts, and only a few big ones. So

somebody who wants to misrepresent or obscure big facts can easily find

trivia about which to be honest, while, for that very reason, being given credit

for being genuintly truthful.

 

  Dr. Your reasoning is cogent, Max.

 

  MAX: But I still don’t quite see how this relates to the briefcase situation.

 

  Dr. K: As I said, that’s a topic for another time.

 

  MAX: Sir, are you just saying that, or will you and I have an exchange in

which it is made clear exactly honesty is to be distinguished from

 

  Dr. K: Yes. We will, and it will be published as an audio book, just like

this exchange.

 

  MAX: One last question, Dr. K. You used to write treatises. Now you

write audio-dialogues. Why is that?

 

  Dr. K: When were primitive, it was all about spoken communication. We

advanced a little, and it became about written communication. We advanced

some more, and now it’s about spoken communication again. And it’s better

this way, since a lot of information that is written in a book is never

uploaded, whereas most information that is spoken is uploaded.

 

  MAX: Good answer, Sir. See you next time.

 

 

 

                                         Anger

 

 

 

  MAX: Dr. K, I have been reading the works of the Buddha. One thing he

repeatedly says is that you should let go of anger. But I don’t want to let go

of my anger.

 

Dr. K:  Why not?

 

  MAX:  Because it would diminish me.

 

Dr. K: How do you mean?

 

  MAX: I don’t want to submit. I want to conquer. It’s easy to be a loser who

lets the world walk all over you, and then rationalize it by saying that you are

a moral person who wants other people to be given their due.

 

Dr. K: I agree. It’s easy to be a loser. It’s easy and its contemptible.

 

  MAX: And it’s hard to be a winner. It’s hard, and it’s admirable.

 

Dr. K: I agree.

 

  MAX: So now you see why I don’t find Buddha’s teachings to be feasible.

 

Dr. K: I understand why that is your position, but your position is

misconceived.

 

  MAX: Explain.

 

Dr. K: The essence of what Buddha is saying, at least in the passages that

you have in mind, is that, if we dwell, if we linger, if live in fantasy, rather

than reality, we will get nowhere.

 

  MAX: Continue. This is helpful.

 Dr. K: It would obviously be ideal if you could make those who had

wronged you pay for their crimes.

 

  MAX: Yes it would be.

 

Dr. K: And perhaps that shall happen. But to the extent that you are

emoting, you are not moving forward. So far as you emote, you live in

fantasy, not in reality. And so far as you live in fantasy, you wither.

 

  MAX: I see. If you spend all your time fantasizing about what you want,

what you’ll get is the exact opposite.

 

Dr. K: Exactly.

 

  MAX: And a necessary precondition for moving forward is that you drop

all of your childish fantasies of revenge.

 

Dr. K: Exactly. The angry man lives in fantasy, not in reality. And his

achievements in reality are as small as his achievements in his imagination

are great.

 

  MAX: So it isn’t that there is anything wrong with the content of your

anger-driven fantasies. It’s that, as long as you fantasize, you aren’t living in

the real world.

 

Dr. K: So you aren’t really living at all.

 

  MAX: So if you spend your time stewing and seething and day-dreaming

about how you’ll get revenge, you’ll do nothing but waste your own time.

 

Dr. K: And your position relative to the person on whom you wish to exact

revenge will decline.

 

  MAX: Because you will be moving backwards.

 

Dr. K: And also because you have already given up.

   MAX: Explain.

 

Dr. K: People who believe in themselves improve themsleves. People who

don’t, don’t. And when people choose fantasy over reality, it is because they

have given up.

 

  MAX: They don’t believe they can change reality. That is the conceit that

lies at the center of all of their day-dreaming.

 

Dr. K: That’s right.

 

  MAX: Contrariwise, if they drop the fantasizing, and therefore drop the

anger that fuels it, they have no choice but accept their circumstances.

 

Dr. K: Their actual circumstances.

 

  MAX: And therefore to improve those circumstances.

 

Dr. K: By small increments at first.

 

  MAX: But those small increments turn into big ones.

 

Dr. K: And the initial tiny steps on the road to self-improvement are

actually the biggest steps.

 

  MAX: In the same way that the difference between 0 and 1 is infinite,

whereas the difference between 1 and and a thousand is finite.

 

Dr. K: Right. The difference between 0 and 1 is the difference between

being and nothingness.  

The difference between 1 and a thousand is the difference between two

numbers.  

 

  MAX: It is the difference between two things that actually exist, as

opposed to one thing that doesn’t and one thing that does.

 

 Dr. K: Exactly. And differences of the first kind are smaller than they

appear to be. 

 

  MAX: I see. When one is mired in fantasy, the difference between a king

and pauper is infinite, because from the day-dreamer’s viewpoint---from his

perspective of utter impotence—it is infinite. But from the perspective of

someone who is steadily improving his circumstances, it is a strictly

quantitative difference.

 

Dr. K: You are a quick study, Max. Let us adjourn.

 

 

                     Knowledge of Past, Possible, and Future

 

 

 

MAX: Professor, can we have knowledge of the future?

 

Dr. K: Yes. If I know that X’s always cause Y’s, and I know that there

currently exists an X, then I can deduce, and therefore know, that there will

be a Y.

 

MAX: Can you give an example?

 

Dr. K: I know that Smith is extremely sensitive about his toupee and

always attacks people who make fun of him for having it. I also know that

Jerry is now making fun of Smith for having it. So I know that Smith will

physically attack Jerry.

 

MAX: In the situation you described, you know that, the circumstances

being what they are, it is highly probable that Smith is going to attack Jerry.

But you don’t know that Smith is going to attack Jerry. After all, Smith might

have a heart-attack before he can throw the first punch.

 

Dr. K: Your point is misconceived. It’s one thing for me to know that

Smith will attack Jerry. It’s a different thing for me to know that the

conditions necessary for my knowing that Smith will attack Jerry are

fulfilled. What you said shows that I lack the latter knowledge, not the first.

 

MAX: I don’t understand.

 

Dr. K: In order for five year old Timmy to know that it’s raining outside,

he just needs to look outside his window. If he does that, then he knows that

the condition necessary for it to be raining outside has been fulfilled. But he

has to cross many more bridges if he is to know that the conditions necessary

for his having that knowledge have been fulfilled. He has to know that his

nervous system is intact, that the relevant physiological and cognitive

structures are appropriatley coordinated with one another and also with the

external world. 

MAX: I am beginning to understand. It’s easy to know that it’s raining. It’s

hard to know exactly what it is that one knows in knowing that it’s raining.

 

Dr. K: Well put.    

 

MAX: And for Timmy to know that it’s raining, he has to be coordinated

with the external world in a certain way. Timmy does not have to know about

this mode of coordination; he just has to be in it.

 

Dr. K: That’s right. 

 

MAX: And your knowing that Smith is going to punch Jerry involves your

being appropriately coordinated with the world. It involves your knowing of

some robust, some reliable causal mechanism that lead to Smith’s punching a

given person if that person makes fun of Smith’s toupee. You need to know

of that mechanism; and that mechanism needs to be doing its job. But you

don’t need to know how it is doing its job.

 

Dr. K: This is spot on. Please continue.

 

MAX: You don’t need to know exactly how that mechanism works, and

you don’t need to know of possible threats to its integrity. Such knowledge is

necessary if you want to have knowledge about your knowledge of Smith’s

imminent behavior. But that is irrelevant, since the question at hand is ‘how

do you know that Smith will punch Jerry?’, not ‘how do you know that you

know that Smith will punch Jerry?’  

 

Dr. K: Admirably well put, Max.

 

Max: What about the past? Can we know it?

 

Dr. K.: There is memory, obviously: what you remember, you know, and

the thing known is a truth about the past.

 

MAX: Is there any other way of knowing about the past?

 Dr. K: Yes. You see footprints in the sand. You know that nothing other

than a person walking in the sand could possibly have created them. And you

duly infer that some person walked in the sand.

 

MAX: So knowledge of the past is just like knowledge of the future, except

that in the one case we deduce effect from cause and in the other case we

deduce cause from effect.

 

Dr. K: Exactly. Prediction starts with cause and ends with effect, and

retrodiction starts with effect and ends with cause.

 

MAX: Can we have knowledge of what might have been?

 

Dr. K: You mean, can we have counterfactual knowledge? Can we know

truths of the form if p had been then case, then q would have been the case.

 

MAX: Exactly. Can it be known that if Smith had jumped off the ledge, he

would have died?

 

Dr. K: You just answered your own question. Obviously we can have such

knowledge. If we couldn’t, we wouldn’t live very long.

 

MAX: You mean, if I didn’t  know that I would be electrocuted if I stuck a

metal fork in the socket, then I would do so----and therefore die a speedy

death.

 

Dr. K: Exactly. If Smith hadn’t know that jumping off the ledge would lead

to his death, he probaby would have jumped.

 

MAX: But how can it be known that if he had jumped, a giant albatross

wouldn’t have swooped in and saved him? I know it sounds absurd, but

unless we know that such a thing would not have happened, we don’t know

that Smith would have died had he jumped.

 

Dr. K: The point you are making is an exact analogue of the point we

discussed earlier.  The skeptic says that Timmy doesn’t know that it’s raining

unless Timmy (a) knows exactly what is involved in his having suchknowledge and (b) knows that all of the relevant conditions have been

satisfied.

  Which is totally absurd, since it’s tantamount to saying that Timmy can’t

know that it’s raining unless he know about the various physical and

physiological intricacies involved.

  Which he can’t possibly know about unless he is already able to know

basic things, like the state of the weather. 

 

MAX: I see. It’s one thing for me to know that Smith would have died had

he jumped. It’s a different thing for me to know that all of the conditions that

had to be fulfilled for my knowing this have in fact been fulfilled. My

knowing the second thing involves my knowing exactly what is involved in

my knowing that Smith would have died had he jumped.

 

Dr. K: Which you couldn’t know unless you already had just the sort of

counterfactual knowledge that the skeptic is claiming that you can’t have.

 

MAX: You’ve established that we do have counterfactual knowledge. But

the question is, how do we have it?

 

Dr. K: Sticking forks in light sockets causes electrocution. Jumping off of

ledges causes massive body trauma. Counterfactual knowledge is simply

causal knowledge.

 

MAX: I see. So having such knowledge doesn’t involve our having

knowledge of alternative realities. It just invovles our knowing what causes

what in this world.

 

Dr. K: Exactly. Counterfactual knowledge has the same structure as

knowledge of the future and knowledge of the past.     

 

MAX: You mean, each sort of knowledge involves knowing a truth of the

form x’s cause y’s and then, depending on the circumstances, moving

forwards y from x or backwards from y towards x.

 

Dr. K: Right. You know that jumping off ledges causes death, and

depending on whether your starting point is Smith’s body on the pavement orSmith’s stepping off the ledge, you either know the past or the future.

 

MAX: Yes, but given that Smith didn’t jump, I have neither starting point.

And that’s the problem.

 

Dr. K: Now I see what’s puzzling you. But there is no real puzzle. Causal

laws map events onto events. Cause and effect are always events or

conditions. They are always concrete realities. But deductions map

propositions onto propositions. 

 

MAX: What’s a proposition?

 

Dr. K: A truth or a falsehood.

 

MAX: I think I understand. The laws of nature convert events into events.

Jones pushes the button. The elevator comes. Nature starts with an event, and

ends with event. But when you see Jones pushing the button and infer that the

elevator will come, you are starting with a proposition and you  ending with

another proposition.

 

MAX: Right. The first proposition being Jones is pushing the button. And

the second being the elevator will come.

 

MAX: And to know that there would be smoke if there were fire is simply

to know that fire causes smoke.

 

Dr. K: Right.

 

MAX: So knowing the future involves knowing knowing that x’s causes

y’s and also knowing that there is an x.

 

Dr. K: Right.

 

MAX: And knowing the past involves knowing that x’s cause y’s and also

knowing that there is a y.

 

Dr. K: Right. 

MAX: But knowing that there would be a y if there is an x only involves

knowing that x’s cause y’s.

 

Dr. K: Exactly.

 

MAX: So it’s actually easier to have counterfactual knowlede than it is to

have knowledge of either the past or the present.

 

Dr. K: Right. Also, knowledge of either the past or the future presupposes

knowledge of the counterfactual. 

 

MAX: Explain.

 

Dr. K: If I don’t know that Smith would die if he jumped, then, if I know

that he is about to jump, I will not be in a position that he will die.

 

MAX: I see. And if I see his shattered body on the pavement, I won’t be in

a position to infer that it was a fall that did him in.

 

Dr. K: Right.

 

MAX: So how do we acquire causal knowledge? How do we learn that

things of one kind bring about things of other some kind?

 

Dr. K: Let’s talk about that next time, Max. We’ve covered enough for one

session.

 

MAX: Agreed. See you tomorrow, Dr. K.

 

 

 

               Determinism, Indeterminism, and Personal Freedom

 

 

 

  MAX: What is determinism?

 

  Dr. K: Determinism is the doctrine that nothing is uncaused. 

 

  MAX: So if determinism is correct, then how the world is now determines

exactly how it will be in the future.

 

  Dr. K: Correct.

 

  MAX: And how it was in the past determines exactly how it is now.

 

  Dr. K: Correct.

 

  MAX: What is indeterminism?

 

  Dr. K: The doctrine that determinism is false.

 

  MAX: If indeterminism is true, does that mean that the universe is

chaotic?

 

  Dr. K: It means that it is chaotic to a non-null degree, but there is

otherwise no limit to how orderly it can be.

 

  MAX: Please clarify.

 

  Dr. K: If there is a single uncaused event, then indeterminism is correct,

even if the universe is otherwise completely deterministic. And it doesn’t

matter how minute that event is.

 

  MAX: I see. But to the extent that the universe is indeterministic, it is

chaotic.

 

  Dr. K: Correct. 

  MAX: And to the extent that it is deterministic, it is orderly.

 

  Dr. K: Correct.

 

  MAX: So if the determinist is right, then my making this very statement is

an inevitable consequence of the previous state of the universe.

 

  Dr. K: Correct

 

  MAX: So if t is some moment in time billions of years ago, then, given the

state the universe at t, it was inevitable that you and I would have this

conversation, and have it in exactly the way in which we are having it.

 

  Dr. K: Exactly.

 

  MAX: So everything that any person thinks, feels, or does is the inevitable

result of events that occurred before he was born.

 

  Dr. K: Correct.

 

  MAX: But if indeterminism is true, then the current state of the universe is

not the inevitable consequence of its previous condition.

 

  Dr. K: Correct.

 

  MAX: So if the indeterminist is right, how the universe was a billion years

ago did not necessarily make it inevitable that we would be having this

exchange.

 

  Dr. K: Correct. And you were right to include the word “necessarily.”

Depending on the exact way in which the universe is indeterministic---

supposing that it is, in fact, indeterministic---our having this conversation

might or might not be an inevitable consequence of the pre-conversation state

of the universe.

 

  MAX: The obvious thing to say, of course, is that, if the determinist isright, then we have no free will.

 

  Dr. K: Yes, that is indeed the obvious thing to say.

 

  MAX: You don’t agree with it, I gather.

 

  Dr. K: I do not.

 

  MAX: But you do agree, surely, that, other things being equal, we are

more free in an indeterministic universe than in a deterministic universe.

 

  Dr. K: I do not. Indeterminism is more of a threat to freedom than

determinism. In fact, determinism is not a threat to freedom. It is in fact

necessary for it. Determinism is as necessary for freedom as indeterminism is

fatal to freedom.

 

  MAX: Explain.

 

  Dr. K: Imagine a hypothetical world  where our minds and bodies are as

deterministic as they are in our world but where the rest of the world is far

more indeterministic than our world is. Let’s refer to that world as ‘W’.

 

  MAX: I think I understand. The idea is that W is so indeterministic that

when you throw a baseball, it is just as likely to turn into a hawk and fly

away as it is to land in the catcher’s mitt.

 

  Dr. K: Exactly. Now let me ask you, would we be more free in W than we

are here?

 

  MAX: No; if anything, less free. At least in our world, there are

dependable mechanisms. So we can control it. But in W, we can’t even do

that.

 

  Dr. K: Exactly. So indeterminism in the external world would not make us

more free.

 

  MAX: Right. The indeterminism would have to be in us. 

  Dr. K: That’s right. So let’s suppose that our nervous systems are

indeterministic. In that case, the condition of my nervous system at a given

time fails to determine its condition at later times.

 

  MAX: Which wouldn’t make us more free.

 

  Dr. K: No, it wouldn’t.

 

  MAX: I understand. At time t, I decide to put on my shirt. Since my

nervous system is indeterministic, its condition at time t leaves it open

whether I will make the requisite bodily movements.

 

  Dr. K: And what about if your central nervous system was

indeterministic?

 

  MAX: The central nervous system---the brain---mediates thought, feeling,

memory, desire, decision-making, judgment. It is responsible for all cognitive

and emotional functions.

 

  Dr. K: That’s right.

 

  MAX: So to the extent that it is indeterministic, what I know now fails to

influence what I do tomorrow.

 

  Dr. K: It also fails to influence what judgments and inferences you make

tomorrow.

 

  MAX: Explain.

 

  Dr. K: At time t1, you know that the berries in your backyard are

poisonous. At later time t2, you are hungry and you are in your backyard.

Your berry-knowledge won’t necessarily lead to the right decision unless the

mechanisms that convert knowledge into intentions are intact. And so far as

those mechanisms are intact, the universe is deterministic.

 

   MAX: And so far as it isn’t, they aren’t.

 

  Dr. K: Correct. And it is only to the extent that the universe is

deterministic that there are any mechanisms to begin with, even ones that

function only intermitttently.

 

  MAX: Explain.

 

  Dr. K: A mechanism is something that can be relied on to produce on

output of a certain kind, when given an input of a certain kind. You put in a

quarter; a coke comes out. You flip the switch; the light turns on. Where

there are mechanisms, there is determinism. Where there is indeterminism,

there are no mechanisms.

 

  MAX: So the world is deterministic to the extent that my psychological

condition at a given time is responsible for my psychological condition at

later times.

 

  Dr. K: Correct.

 

  MAX: So indeterminism threatens my mind’s ability to have any effect on

its later condition.

 

  Dr. K: Correct.

 

  MAX: So to the extent that my mind is indeterministic, it has no control

over itself.

 

  Dr. K: Correct.

 

  MAX: And to the extent that the mechanisms linking my mind to my body

are indeterministic, my mind has no control over my body.

 

  Dr. K: Correct.

 

  MAX: And to the extent that the mechanisms governing the external

world are indeterministic, I have no control over the external world. 

  Dr. K: Correct.

 

  MAX: So the more indeterministic a mind is, the more incoherent it is. 

 

  Dr. K: The more its future condition fails to cohere with its present

condition.

 

  MAX: And the more its present condition fails to cohere with its past

condition.

 

  Dr. K: And it is therefore no mind at all, but rather a series of mutually

isolated minds .

 

  MAX: And the same is true of each of those mini-minds.

 

  Dr. K: Since its earlier states fail to cohere with its later states.

 

  MAX: So it exists only for an instant.

 

  Dr. K: And therefore doesn’t exist at all.

 

  MAX: You’ve convinced me. Indeterminism is a threat to personal

freedom.

 

  Dr. K: Not to just to personal freedom, but to personal identity.

 

  MAX: How do you mean?

 

  Dr. K: You said it yourself. The less deterministic a mind is, the less its

past states cohere with its future states. And unless there is a minimum of

coherence, there is no enduring self. There is, at most, a series of mutually

isolated mental states.

 

  MAX: Yes, but those states would all belong to the same body; so even

though they couldn’t have the direct sort of influence that, in the case of lucid

human beings, mental states have on one another, they could influence eachother indirectly. A given mental state could influence the host-body, which in

turn could give rise to, or otherwise influence, some later mental state.

 

  Dr. K: Yes, but you are presupposing the presence of deterministic

mechanisms in that body.

 

  MAX: Touché.

 

  Dr. K: And could there even be enduring physical bodies in an

indeterministic world?

 

  MAX: Are you referring to bodies in the biological sense or in the strictly

physics-related sense?

 

  Dr. K: Both.

 

  MAX: I don’t see why not. In an indeterministic world, there would be

billiard balls, but the laws governing their interactions would leave it open

what those interactions led to.

 

  Dr. K: First of all, when you talk about the ‘interactions’ of billiard balls,

you are talking about the effects they have on one another, and in an

indeterministic world, things don’t have effects on one another. 

 

  MAX: I don’t follow.

 

  Dr. K: Suppose that, in this hypothetical world of ours, which we will

once again refer to as W, billiard ball x collides with billiard ball y. If there

are laws in W that determine what the outcome of that collision will be, then

W is not, at least not that extent, a genuinely indeterministic world.

 

  MAX: I follow.

 

  Dr. K: So to the extent that W is indeterministic, it is open what the

outcome will be. Upon being struck, the  ball might go right, left, up, or

down, or sprout wings and fly away.

   MAX: I see.

 

  Dr. K: And whatever that outcome is, to the extent that the collision was

so much as dispositive of it, W deterministic.

 

  MAX: Please clarify.

 

  Dr. If such a collision made that outcome 98% likely, then ceteris paribus

W is more deterministic than a world in which such a collision made it only

51% likely.

 

  MAX: And a world in which that outcome was 51% likely would, in turn,

would be more deterministic than one in which it was only 14% likely and in

which no possible outcome had a probabilility of more than 14%.

 

  Dr. K: Now you’re getting the idea.

 

  MAX: And a maximally indeterministic world would be one in which

nothing was more dispositive of a given outcome than any other thing.

 

  Dr. K: That’s right, bringing us to the question I asked a moment ago: In a

maximally indeterministic universe, would there be anything to begin with? I

mean, would there be any thing?

 

  MAX: Explain.

 

  Dr. K: Is it that, in such a universe, there would be rocks and trees, and

maybe even babies and giraffes, but their interactions would be irregular and

would have no foreseeable outcomes?

 

  MAX: Obviously such a world wouldn’t comprise any organisms. If the

beating of a heart was as likely to make blood boil as it was to pump it, and if

other organs and tissues were similarly unable to guarantee the right results,

then, obviously, there would be no giraffes or babies.

 

  Dr. K: Exactly. So let’s talk about purely physical objects: things that

aren’t minds, don’t have minds, and aren’t organisms, not even of the singlecelled variety.

 

  MAX: Rocks, billiard balls, planets, atoms. That sort of thing.

 

  Dr. K: Right. Could such things exist in an indeterministic universe?

 

  MAX: I don’t see why not. 

 

  Dr. K: To the naked eye, a billiard ball looks like a single indivisible

object. But it consists of trillions of micro-particles interacting with each one

another.

 

  MAX: I see where you’re going. And if those interactions weren’t

governed by deterministic laws; if a given such interaction was just as likely

to lead to this as opposed to that outcome; then each particle would go its

own way, not being kept in place by deterministic laws, and the billiard ball

would powder into nothingness.

 

  Dr. K: It would disintegrate. Literally.

 

  MAX: Right. Or, rather, it wouldn’t even be there to disintegrate in the

first place. The only things that would exist in such a universe would be the

micro-particles that,  in a deterministic universe, would have composed it.

 

  Dr. K: Would they?

 

  MAX: How do you mean?

 

  Dr. K: Atoms consist of interacting parts, just like billiard balls.

 

  MAX: I see. Only the sub-atomic parts would exist then.

 

  Dr. K: Are you sure about that?

 

  MAX: I don’t see why they wouldn’t. But it doesn’t really matter. You’ve

proved your first point, that indeterminism is a threat to personal freedom.

But you have not proved your second point, that determinism is necessary forit.

 

  Dr. K: Actually, I have proved it. 

 

  MAX: Explain.

 

  Dr. K: To the extent that the world outside of our bodies is indeterministic,

we cannot control it, and it follows that it is controllable only to the extent

that it is deterministic.

 

  MAX:  Yes, that does follow. But freedom is not about being able to

control external objects. At least, that’s not all it’s about.

 

  Dr. K: What else is it about?

 

  MAX: Being able to control one’s body.

 

  Dr. K: Agreed, but it is only to the extent that the world is deterministic

that there are mechanisms by which mind can control body.

 

  MAX: Good point.  But control over the external world, and even control

over one’s own body---these are mere manifestations of freedom. These

things are significant--- utterly significant. But what makes them significant

is that they mobilize some other, deeper kind of freedom.

 

  Dr. K: I am in intrigued. Please explain.

 

  MAX: A rock cannot be said to have control over anything. Events

involving the rock have effects, obviously. But when the rock smashes a

window, it isn’t doing anything, at least not in the sense in which a person is

doing something when he brushes his teeth or plays the piano or digs a ditch. 

 

  Dr. K: I agree. But why? What is it that a person has, that a rock lacks,

whereby the person can, but the rock cannot, do things, in the relevantly

pregnant sense of the word “do”?

 

  MAX: There is a kind of inner freedom that the person has that the rocklacks, and when the person interacts with the world, he is externalizing that

inner freedom.

 

  Dr. K: I vaguely understand. There is freedom, and there is power. Power

is the ability to convert freedom into desired results. But power presupposes

the existence of freedom, and must therefore be distinguished from it.

 

  MAX: Well stated.

 

  Dr. K: I agree with all of this, so far as I understand it. And all of it is

further proof that determinism is a prerequisite for freedom.

 

  MAX: How do you mean?

 

  Dr. K: If a person does not have control over his future mental states, does

he have this inner freedom you speak of?

 

  MAX: No. If a person cannot govern his own mind, he is not free. He is

like someone who, because of a degenerative neural disorder, cannot govern

his own body.

 

  Dr. K: Someone like Stephen Hawking, who has Lou Gherig’s disease.

 

  MAX: Exactly, except that Stephen Hawking has an intact mind, and

therefore has a very important sort of freedom that this other person lacks.

 

  Dr. K: That’s right. Stephen Hawking can control his thoughts. He can

make judgments and decisions that appropriately reflect his past experiences

and are otherwise appropriately controlled by considerations of logic and

evidence.

 

  MAX: Exactly.

 

  Dr. K: So this inner freedom you are discussing---one has it to the extent

that one’s current mental state embodies the appropriate sort of

responsiveness to one’s previous mental states.

   MAX: That sounds right.

 

  Dr. K: Therefore, one has it only to the extent that one’s future mental

states embody the right sort of responsiveness to one’s present mental state.

 

  MAX: That obviously follows.

 

  Dr. K: So possession of this inner freedom is not about having a mind

whose mental states don’t determine one another; it is about having a mind

whose mental states determine one another in the right way.

 

  MAX: I see. Your second point is correct, then: determinism is indeed

necessary for freedom. But it is not sufficient for it.

  Dr. K: There is a trivial sense in which that is true. In a deterministic

world in which there are no animate beings, there is no freedom.

 

  MAX: Yes, but that isn’t what I mean. You seem to holld that there

different kinds of freedom---control over the external world, control over

one’s body, and control over one’s mind.

 

  Dr. K: That’s right.

 

  MAX: Each of which you believe to be identical with some sort of causal

integrity.

 

  Dr. K:  Yes, a person is free if his mind is constitutive of the right sort of

causal integration.

 

  MAX: And my view is that a person is not free unless his mind is

constitutive of the right sort of causal integration, but I don’t grant that a

person is free if that condition is satisfied.   

 

  Dr. K: So in your view, indeterminism is incompatible with freedom, and

so is determinism.

 

  MAX: Exactly. Freedom is impossible in an indeterministic world, it is

impossible in a determinstic world, and it is therefore impossible sansqualification.

 

  Dr. K: Why is it impossible in a deterministic world?

 

  MAX: For the reason given earlier, that, in a deterministic world, what I

am doing now is the inevitable consequence of what happened before I was

born. Therefore, what I am doing now is the inevitable result of events over

which I have no control. Therefore, I do not control the things that control

me. Therefore, I control nothing and therefore have no freedom.

 

  Dr. K: Well stated.

 

  MAX: So you agree.

 

  Dr. K: No.

 

  MAX: Why not?

 

  Dr. K: For illustrative reasons, let’s consider somebody who did very bad

things and who is to be blamed for those things, at least in so far as anyone is

to be blamed for anything.

 

  MAX: Someone like Stalin.

 

  Dr. K: Yes, exactly. And for argument’s sake, let’s suppose that the world

is deterministic. Question: Did the state of the universe prior to Stalin’s birth

make Stalin do the things he did?

 

  MAX: Yes. Assuming, as we are, that the world is deterministic, then yes.

 

  Dr. K: Or---there is a second part to my question---is it rather that the

universe made it inevitable that Stalin would come into existence and, once in

existence, freely do all of the bad things he did?

 

  MAX: I don’t see how those questions differ.

 

  Dr. K: Before Stalin was born, the universe could---and did---make itinevitable that Stalin eventually come into existence. 

 

  MAX: Clearly.

 

  Dr. K: So however it was that Stalin’s character was configured, the

universe made it inevitable, long before Stalin was born, that someone with

that exact configuration would come into existence.  

 

  MAX: Exactly. 

 

  Dr. K: And it made it inevitable that forces constitutive of Stalin’s

character lead to certain decisions on Stalin’s part, and therefore to certain

actions on Stalin’s part.

 

  MAX: I am beginning to understand your position.

 

  Dr. K: The state of universe prior to Stalin’s conception made it inevitable

that Stalin would come into existence and, moreover, that Stalin-constitutive

psychological structures be responsible for decisions and subsequent actions

on Stalin’s part.

 

  MAX: I see. For an action on Stalin’s part to be free is for Stalin to be

responsible for it.

 

  Dr. K: And for Stalin to be responsible for it is for Stalin-constitutive

forces to be responsible for it.

 

  MAX: And for such forces to be responsible for it is for them to cause it.

 

  Dr. K:   And until such forces, such Stalin-constitutive forces, are in

existence, we cannot talk of Stalin’s being made to do this or that.

 

  MAX: And once he is in existence, his being made to do this as opposed

to that consists in those forces being directed in this as opposed to that

direction---in some direction that do not allign with Stalin’s objectives,

presumably. And his doing something freely consists in their being directed

by forces that do so allign. 

  Dr. K: Well put.

 

  MAX: Is there more to know about free will?

 

  Dr. K: There is, but that is almost everything that the discipline of

philosophy has to say about it. The rest, or at least a good part of the rest, is

for psychoanalysis to say.

 

  MAX:  And what will we discuss next time?

 

  Dr. K: The relationship between predictability and determinism.

 

  MAX: I look forward to it.

 

 

 

                               What is a Law of Logic?

 

 

  MAX: Dr. K, what is a law of logic?

 

Dr. K: The expression ‘law of logic’ has two meanings. On the one hand, a

‘law of logic’ is any statement that belongs to a system of logic. On the other

hand, a ‘law of logic’ is any statement that describes a condition that must be

satisfied by any such system. 

 

  MAX: I don’t understand. You are going to have to explain pretty every

single word of that statement to me.

 

Dr. K: And I will do so, starting with the term ‘logic’ itself. A logic---

equivalently, a system of logic---is a recursively defined statement-set.

 

  MAX: What is a statement-set?

 

Dr. K: A set whose elements are statements.

 

  MAX: So the English language is a statement-set.

 

Dr. K: Correct:

 

  MAX: What is a recursively defined set?

 

Dr. K: A recursively defined set is the smallest set containing some object

alpha and also containing phi of x whenever it contains x, where phi is somefunction that is defined for each of its own outputs.

 

  MAX: So the class of natural numbers is a recursively defined statement-

set.

 

Dr. K: Exactly. It is the smallest class contaiing 0 and containing n+1

whenever it contains n.

 

  MAX: So F(x)=x+1 is a recursive function.

 

Dr. K: Correct.

 

  MAX: And a recursive function is one that is defined for each of its own

outputs.

 

Dr. K: Yes. And a recursive statement-function is a recursive function that

assigns statements to statements.  

 

  MAX: So the negation-function---the function that assigns the negation of

a statement to that statement---is a recursive statement-function.

 

Dr. K: Correct.

 

  MAX: And a logic is a recursively defined statement-set.

 

Dr. K: Yes. But in order for a logic to have any value, it must be

consistent.

   MAX: You mean, no two of its statement can be incompatible with each

other.

 

Dr. K: Yes. And a corollary is that, if phi is the recursion that generates a

given logic, phi is truth-preservative.

 

  MAX: Meaning that if p is a true statement, then phi of p is also a true

statement.

 

Dr. K: Right. And given that phi of p is true whenever p is true, it follows

that phi of p is a consequence of p.

 

  MAX: So q is a consequence of p if there exists a truth-preservative

recursion phi such that phi of p equals q.

 

Dr. K: Or, to put it more simply, if p is true, and q follows from p, then q is

true.

 

  MAX: Which, of course, is the Law of Detachment, better known as

modus ponens. If p, and if p then q, then q. 

 

Dr. K:  Correct. But the term ‘modus ponens’ is ambiguous. It has one

meaning that is not logic specific---one meaning that holds of systems of

logic in general, and isn’t specific to any one system of logic. At the same

time, given any specific system of logic, it has a meaning that is specific that

logic.

 

  MAX: Explain, starting with the first point. 

Dr. K: If phi is a truth-preservative recursion, and psi is a different truth-

preservative recursion, then phi of p is a consequence of p, and psi of p is

also a consequence of p, even though the relation that p bears to phi of p may

otherwise be very different from the relatoin that psi of p bears to p.

 

  MAX: I think I understand. Let phi be the function that, when given a

statement S, generates the statement ‘it is possible that S.’ So if S is ‘snow is

white’, then phi of S is ‘it is possible that is white.’ And let  psi be the

function that, when given S, generates ‘it is false that it is false that S.’ So if

S is ‘snow is white’, then psi of S is ‘it is false that it is false that snow is

white.’

 

Dr. K: This is good, Max. Continue.

 

  MAX: Phi is a truth-preservative recursion, and so is psi. And phi of p is a

consequence of p, and so is psi of p. But the relation that p bears to phi of p is

otherwise different from the relation that psi of p bears to p.

 

Dr. K: Exactly.

 

  MAX: So phi is one specification, for lack of a better word, of the

consequence-relation wears many hats, and psi is another.

 

Dr. K: Exactly.

 

  MAX: And modus ponens can be taken to say that, if chi is any chosen

specification of the conequence relation, then chi of p is true whenever p istrue.

 

Dr. K: Exactly.

 

  MAX: But if L is some specific logic, then there is an L-specific version of

modus ponens.

 

Dr. K:  Exactly. If zeta is the recursion that generates some specific

statement-set L, then the L-specific version of modus ponens says that  zeta

of s is true whenever s is true.

 

  MAX: And the same thing mutatis mutandis is true of the law of

transitivity.

 

Dr. K: You are right. But I would like you to state your reasoning as

explicitly as possible.

 

  MAX: According to the principle of transitivity, if p entails q and q entails

r, then p entails r.  This principle has a general meaning---one that is true of

all systems of logic, and isn’t specific to any one system of logic.

 

Dr. K: And what exactly is the logic-non-specific interpretation of the

principle of transitivity?

 

  MAX: That, given any truth-preservative recursion phi, phi of phi of p is

true when p is true.

 

Dr. K: Exactly. 

  MAX: At the same time, if L is some specific system of logic, and psi is

the recursion that generates L, the L-specific version of transitity is that psi of

psi of p is true if p is true.

 

Dr. K: Exactly. The L-specific version of transitity doesn’t talk about all

truth-preservative recursions. It only concerns psi.

 

  MAX: And everything that we just said about modus ponens and

transitivity is also true of modus tollens, this being the principle that if p

entails q and q is false, then p is false.

 

Dr. K: That’s right.

 

  MAX: But I don’t see how to extend this line of reasoning to other laws of

logic, such as double negation, excluded middle, and non-contradiction.

 

Dr. K:  Actually, the justifications, and therefore the very meanings, of

those statements are to be understood in terms of the very points you’ve been

making, and there is no other way to understand them.

 

  MAX: Please explain.

 

Dr. K:  Consider the so-called law of excluded middle.

 

  MAX: Either p or not p.

 

Dr. K:  Right. Suppose you deny it. What follows? 

  MAX: That p may be neither true nor false.

 

Dr. K:  That’s right. Now, a logic consists of a set of statements that are

assumed to be true, along with the consequences of those statements.

 

  MAX: Right.

 

Dr. K:  So if a statement s belongs to a logic, that is either because (a) s is

an axiom, and therefore true by hypothesis, or (b) some statements t belongs

to that logic and phi of t = s, where phi is the recursion that generates that

logic.

 

  MAX: So s is either assumed to be true or it is a conseuquence of a

statement that is assumed to be true.

 

Dr. K:  Right.

 

  MAX:   And not-s is either the negation of a statement that is assumed to

be true, in which case it is false, or it is negation of a consequence of such a

statement, in which case it is false. 

 

Dr. K:  Right. There is no way that not-s can fail to be false.

 

  MAX: Given any system of logic L, a statement s is true, by L’s lights, if s

belongs to L; and a statement s is false, by L’s lights, if s is the negation of a

statement belongs to L. And L cannot recognize any statement that doesn’t

fall into in any one of those categories.  

Dr. K:  And that is the L-specific version of the Law of Excluded Middle.

 

  MAX: So, as far as any given system of logic is concerned, any given

statement is either true or false.

 

Dr. K:  And that is the logic-non-specific version of the Law of Excluded

Middle. 

 

  MAX: What about the Law of Non-contradiction, this being the principle

that no statement is both true and false?

 

Dr. K: Suppose that some system of logic L contains both s and not-s.

 

  MAX: In that case, L contains the negation of any given statement that it

contains.

 

Dr. K:  And it therefore yields no unequivocal verdict as to the truth or

falsity of any given statement and is therefore worthless.

 

  MAX: So given some particular system of logic L, the L-specific version

of the Law of Excluded Middle is: if p belongs to L, then not-p does not

belong to L.

 

Dr. K:  And what is the L-non-specific version?

 

  MAX: That no system of logic contains the negation of any given

statement that it contains. 

Dr. K:  Exactly.

 

  MAX: So even if there does exist some some statement that is neither true

nor false, or that is both true and false, that statement has no place in any

logic.

 

Dr. K:  And the fact that it has no place in any logic means that it has no

place anywhere, i.e. there exists no such statement.

 

  MAX: Explain.

 

Dr. K:  A logic is simply a way of organizing statements in such a way that

their deductive interrelations are made clear. For reasons that you and I

discuss elsewhere, there is no logic that contains every true statement.

 

  MAX: Because true statements about a given logic do not themselves, as a

rule, belong to that logic.

 

Dr. K: That’s right. So even though, for that reason, no logic contains

every true statement, nonetheless, any given true statement belongs to many a

logic. In fact, any such statement itself generates a logic.

 

  MAX: Right. Because if S is true, then, given some truth-preservative

recursion phi, the posterity of S under phi is a logic. 

 

Dr. K:  Right. And if S is false, then not-S generates a logic.

   MAX: And it’s only if S is neither true nor false that neither S nor its

negation generates a logic.

 

Dr. K:  Right. And supposing that neither S nor its negation belongs to any

logic, what follows?

 

  MAX: That, when stating how two or more statements bear on one

another, it is not necessary to affirm S, and it is not necessary to deny S.

Wherefore, S is as good as non-existent.

 

Dr. K:  Because that’s what it is. Non-existent. A statement that is neither

nor false is one whose consequences are neither true nor false, whose

negation is neither true nor false, and the consequences of whose negation are

neither true nor false. Such a statement is a perfect nullity.

 

  MAX: So the various logicians and philosophers who fiddle about with

multi-valued logics, what are they doing?

 

Dr. K: You just answered your own question, Max. See you tomorrow.

 

  MAX:    See you tomorrow, Sir.

 

 

  

                      RATIONALITY VS. INTELLIGENCE

 

 

 

 

 

MAX: JOHN, I LOVED YOUR AUDIO BOOK ON KANT. AND THE

NARRATOR WAS FABULOUS. WHAT’S HER NAME AGAIN?

 

JOHN: NORMA JEAN GRADSKY. BEST NARRATOR I’VE EVER

WORKED WITH.

 

MAX: YES, AND NOT JUST A NARRATOR. AN ACTRESS.

 

JOHN: THAT’S RIGHT.

 

MAX: DO YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU A QUESTION. IT’S SEMI-

PERSONAL.

 

 

JOHN: SURE.

 

MAX: DID SHE LIKE THE BOOK?

 

 

JOHN: NORMA?

 

MAX: YES.

 

 

JOHN: I’M NOT SURE, ACTUALLY. SHE DISAGREE WITH SHARPLY

WITH ONE OF THE KEY CONTENTIONS.

 MAX: Which one?

 

JOHN: I said that animals do not deliberate; that they are not rational. 

 

MAX: I remember that part. It was the most interesting part of the whole

book. But it was also the part that I most disagreed with. It was the only part

that I disagreed with actually.

 

JOHN: Elaborate please.

 

MAX: I actually have your book on me, the physical book. Do you mind if I

quote the relevant passage?

 

JOHN: That would be good.

 

MAX: Ok. Here is what you write:

 

 
Do dogs make choices?Obviously dogs have intentions. (The dog intends to

get to the ball before the other dog. That’s why it’s running so frantically.)

But  it  seems  wrong  to  say  that  dogs  “choose”  (or  “decide”).  Dogs  don’t

deliberate. They just react. The dog sees red meat: he pounces on it. He sees

his brutal master: he cringes. The dog’s life is a series of programmed and

therefore compulsive reactions to immediate stimuli. The dog doesn’t call the

shots;  these  hardwired  reaction  protocols  call  the  shots  for  him,  and  it

therefore doesn’t make choices. Only creatures that deliberate make choices.

Sub-rational creatures don’t make choices. Non-rational creatures don’t act;

they react.

      Rational creatures don’t just react. Their responses to situations are

considered. That doesn’t mean that they deliberate before every act. (Nor

should  they,  since  a  life  spent  deliberating  would  be  one  of  “analysis

paralysis”—of over-thinking what one should do and therefore never doinganything. It’s therefore irrational to deliberate too much. It’s irrational to be

too rational!) But their responses to situations are guided by choices that

they’ve made, and those choices result from prior deliberations on their part.

I see an ice-cold beer in the fridge. Were I to react instinctively, I’d drink it.

But long ago I made a choice to live a certain way (to be an author and,

therefore, to avoid things, such as getting drunk in the morning, that would

make it hard for me to ply my trade), and my instantaneous decision not to

drink it reflects that choice. So even though I don’t deliberate, my act (of

refraining from drinking the beer) is the embodiment of prior deliberation on

its part. The dog’s reactions, by contrast, do not reflect previously made life

choices.

 

 

JOHN: What is it that you disagree with in passage?

 

MAX: It is a matter of obvious fact, John, that animals do think. You seem to

be saying that they are robots, automatons. But that isn’t true. I grant that

they may lack the ability to reason abstractly. But they do reason. There is

surely difference between my dog---my friendly and intelligent and

responsive dog---and a tape work. What you say of my dog is true of the tape

work: it can react; it you prick it with a needle, it responds reflexively. But it

utterly lacks autonomy or rationality. But my dog is obviously in a radically

different category.

 

JOHN: Max, I agree with almost everything you are saying. There is just one

crucial distinction that you are not making.

 

MAX: What is that?

 

 

JOHN: The distinction between intelligence and rationality.

 

MAX: When you said that, a bolt of lightning went off in my head. 

 

JOHN: So you see where I am going?

 

MAX: I think so. Let’s suppose Dr. Demento is some incredibly brilliant

scientists who is in love with Sally. To this end, he creates a Frankentstein-

type zombie that serenades her at night. Obviously an unfathomable amount

of intelligence went in Dr. Demento’s creating this ghoul, but his doing so

was not rational.

 

JOHN: Exactly. There was a lot intelligence in what Dr. Demento did, but no

judgment.

 

MAX: Exactly. He did not reflect on what the probable consequences his

efforts would be.

 

JOHN: And it is precisely this sort of reflectiveness that is the very essence

of rationality.

 

MAX: Please explain.

 

JOHN: Intelligence is about the world. Rationality is about one’s relationship

to the world. Dr. Demento has a deep understanding of the cause and effect

relations governing reality. And this makes him intelligent. What he lacks is a

certain reflectiveness about his own relationship to reality. He doesn’t take

the trouble to ask himself ‘is this course of action likely to further my own

objectives?’ Nor a fortiori does he ask himself ‘are my objectives ones worth

having?’

 

MAX: I see. So even though Dr. Demento is incredible thoughtful, for lack of

a better word, in some respects, he is incredibly impulsive---almost

animalistically impulsive---in other respects. When it comes to figuring out

how to sew a head on a cadaver, he is very thoughtful. when it comes to

figuring out whether or not doing this will make Sally love him, he is not

very thoughtful. 

 

JOHN: Exactly.

 

MAX: And what you are saying, give or take a few nuances, is that my dog---

my very intelligent dog---is like Dr. Demento.

 

 

JOHN: Precisley. Your dog is smart. His behavior makes that clear. He is not

a like a tape-worm. He is not a reflex-machine. He is not a machine of any

kind. But he is also not rational.

 

MAX: For the reason that he does not reflect on whether his actions will

further his objectives.

 

 

JOHN: Or, more importantly, on whether those objectives are ones worth

having.

 

MAX: I see. But surely there is an important difference between my dog and

Dr. Demento.

 

JOHN: Yes there is.

 

MAX: What is that difference?

 

JOHN: That Dr. Demento could be rational whereas your dog could not be.

 

MAX: I think I understand. A dog is a dog is a dog. And although I can train

my dog and in some respects educate it, I cannot make physicist or a

philosopher out of it. And its inability to reflect is rooted in its nature. By

contrast, Dr. Demento’s non-reflectiveness has to do with some pathological

affliction----some psychological disturbance---that is preventing him from

operationalizing a certain reflectiveness to which, as a human being, he is

naturally disposed. 

 

JOHN: Exactly. Also, Demento’s non-reflectiveness is contextual.

 

MAX: You mean that it’s confined to certain situations.

 

 

JOHN: Exactly. It’s circumscribed. Demento may be very impusive and

unreflective when it comes to relationships, but when it comes to applying to

graduate school or to deciding what his research project will be, he may well

be a paragon of deliberateness and reflectiveness.

 

MAX: And given how learned he is, it is overwhelmingly likely that he is

reflective in certain ways.

 

JOHN: Exactly. Otherwise, he could not have embarked or, let alone

sustained a commitment to, the long courses of study that led to his being so

knowledgeable.

 

MAX: With all due respect Sir, I think that Dr. Demento represents you.

 

 

JOHN: Oh come now, Max! Whatever else you might say about me, I’m

pretty sane.

 

MAX: Yes, you are sane. But that’s not what I’m referring to.

 

JOHN: Explain.

 

MAX: You’re very smart in some ways, and very functional in some ways.

But your intelligence, and your judgment, your rationality, are oddly

encapsulated. You will decide to write a book or podcast, like this one, even

though your time would be better spent doing something remunerative.

 

JOHN: There is a certain truth in that. 

MAX: And although you obviously could make money with your writing and

your podcasts, you still write all of this boring philosophy shit----pardon my

French---which nobody wants to buy.

 

 

JOHN: Max, your second point is correct. Nobody wants to read analytic

philosophy. When I became an analytic philosopher, my plan was to be a

professor, so I didn’t have to worry about whether people would buy my

books. I’m no longer a professor; so I do have to worry about that; so now

I’m writing different things.

 

MAX: Then what is this podcast about? This is analytic philosophy, isn’t it?

 

 

JOHN: Yes, but this podcast is less about analytic philosophy and more about

starting my career as an interviewer and podcaster, and general wheeler and

dealer.

 

MAX: I see. So the idea is you’re introducing the world to the conversational

side of John-Michael Kuczynski, to the less button-down discursive side; and

you happen to be using a bit of analytic philosophy to do this.

 

 

JOHN: Exactly. And the analytic philosophy is merely the vehicle for this

career move that I am easing into.

 

MAX: And you’re going to do a real interview with Norma Jean Gradsky, the

narrator, is that right?

 

JOHN: Yes it is. And this podcast is meant to be a kind of precursor to it, and

also a promo for it.

 

                         THE FRAUD OF SKEPTICISM

 

 

NORMA JEAN: HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY, DR. K?

DR. K: I FEEL LIKE DEATH WARMED OVER.

NORMA JEAN: BUT THAT DOESN’T STOP YOU FROM CRANKING

OUT MORE DIALOGUES. HOW DO YOU DO IT, DR. K? HOW DO

YOU PRODUCE SO MUCH? WHAT IS YOUR SECRET?

DR. K: MY SECRET IS SIMPLE: WHENEVER I FEEL THE URGE TO

PICK UP THE PHONE AND YACK, I DON’T. INSTEAD, I WRITE IT

DOWN.

NORMA JEAN: WRITE WHAT DOWN, DR. K?

DR. K: WRITE DOWN THE CONVERSATION THAT I WOULD HAVE

HAD?

NORMA JEAN: BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT

CONVERSATION WOULD HAVE BEEN?

DR. K: SUCH NEGATIVISM, SUCH SELF-DOUBT.

NORMA JEAN: IT ISN’T SELF-DOUBT. IT’S LEGITIMATE

SKEPTICISM.

DR. K: IT IS SKEPTICISM, BUT THERE IS NOTHING LEGITIMATE

ABOUT IT.

NORMA JEAN: BUT AREN’T PHILOSOPHERS THE GREATEST

SKEPTICS OF ALL?

DR. K: THAT DOESN’T MAKE IT GOOD.

NORMA JEAN: GOOD FROM WHAT VIEWPOINT?

DR. K: CLARIFY.

NORMA JEAN: YOU SEEM TO BE SAYING THAT SKEPTICISM IS

SOMEHOW CONTRAINDICATED, THAT IT IS MISCONCEIVED. BUT

MISCONCEIVED HOW, EXACTLY? MISCONCEIVED AS A

PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION, AS AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL POSITION?

OR MISCONCEIVED IN SOME OTHER WAY? SOME OTHER DEEPER

WAY?

DR. K: YOU JUST ANSWERED YOUR OWN QUESTION, NORMA

JEAN. OR RATHER I HAD ALREADY ANSWERED IT BEFORE YOU

ASKED IT.NORMA JEAN: EXPLAIN.

DR. K: SKEPTICISM IS FIRST AND FOREMOST ABOUT SELF-

DOUBT. NEUROTIC, SELF-DEFEATING, MORBID SELF-DOUBT. ONE

IS PROJECTING ONE’S SELF-DOUBT INTO THE EXTERNAL WORLD.

INSTEAD OF TELLING ONESELF ‘I DOUBT MYSELF; I DOUBT

MYSELF BECAUSE I AM WEAK, BROKEN, AND LAZY. I DOUBT

MYSELF BECAUSE, IF I IDIDN’T, I WOULD HAVE TO ACT; BUT I

PREFER TO LIVE IN AN AUTISTIC CACOON OF LOSERDOM.’

INSTEAD OF SAYING, THE SKEPTIC SAYS: ‘I AM BEING

RATIONAL. INTELLIGENT PEOPLE DOUBT. DUMMIES BELIEVE.

DUMMIES OVER DRAW CONCLUSIONS. DUMMIES ACCEPT

THINGS ON FAITH. THINKERS DO NOT. THINKERS ARE SKEPTICS.’

NORMA JEAN: ISN’T IT TRUE?

DR. K: NO. THERE IS NOTHING ACCURATE, INSIGHTFUL, OR

OTHERWISE REAL ABOUT HIS POSITION. IT IS A FRAUD IN EVERY

CONCEIVABLE WAY.

NORMA JEAN: PLEASE EXPLAIN.

DR. K: FIRST OF ALL, THE SELF-DESCRIBED SKEPTIC IS ONLY A

SKEPTIC IN A VERY SPECIFIC WAYS. IN WAYS THAT ARE

SOCIALLY SAFE. HE SAYS THAT HE IS A SKEPTIC ABOUT THE

EXTERNAL WORLD. THAT JUST MEANS THAT HE IS REFUSING TO

TAKE A POSITION. WHEN HE IS IN A SITUATION WHERE HE HAS

TO WEIGHT IN, BUT HE IS EITHER TOO WEAK OR TOO IGNORANT

OR TOO STUPID TO BE ABLE TO DO SO, HE JUST DEFAULTS TO

HIS PAT ANSWER, WHICH IS ‘I DON’T KNOW; THERE ISN’T

ENOUGH EVIDENCE.’

NORMA JEAN: I SEE.

DR. K: OF COURSE, WHEN HE IS IN A POSITION WHERE ON WEIGH

IN, WITH IMPUNITY, WHERE HE DOES HAVE THE SOCIAL POWER

NECESSARY TO DO SO, WHEN THAT IS THE CASE, HIS

SKEPTICISM VANISHES, LIKE A GHOST AT SUNRISE.

NORMA JEAN: I’M BEGINNING TO WARM YOUR POSITION, DR. K.

NO SKEPTIC ACTUALLY BELIEVES HIS OWN POSITION. BUT

EVERY SKEPTIC, AT LEAST EVERY SKEPTIC THAT I HAVE

KNOWN, WAS BASICALLY A COWARD OR AN INTELLECTUALLIGHT WEIGHT, AND USUALY BOTH, AND SIMPLY DIDN’T HAVE

THE GUTS TO WEIGH AND WOULDN’T HAVE KNOWN HOW TO DO

SO IF HE HAD.

DR. K: EXACTLY. EXACTLY.

NORMA JEAN: BUT GRANTING THAT PEOPLE’S REASONS FOR

BEING SKEPTICS MAY BE THE WRONG ONES, AREN’T THERE IN

FACT LEGITIMATE REASONS, OF A PURELY PHILOSOPHICAL

KIND, FOR BEING A SKEPTIC? GRANTING THAT WHEN PEOPLE

ARE SKEPTICS, IT IS USUALLY BECAUSE OF THEIR INFIRMITIES

OF CHARACTER AND INTELLECT, AREN’T THERE COGENT

REASONS, OF A STRICTLY KNOWLEDGE-THEORETIC NATURE,

FOR ACCEPTING SKEPTICISM?

DR. K: NO. IN FACT, IT IS ONLY WHEN SKEPTICISM IS CONSIDERD

ON ITS OWN TERMS—IT IS ONLY WHEN ATTEMPTS ARE MADE

TO FIND A LEGITIMATELY, STRICTLY PHILOSPOHICAL BASIS FOR

IT---THAT IT BECOMES CLEAR HOW LACKING IN PHILOSOPHICAL

LEGITIMACY IT IS AND, THERFORE, HOW THOROUGHLY

EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL IN NATURE ARE THE REASONS FOR

ACCEPTING IT.

NORMA JEAN: PLEASE CLARIFY, DR. K

DR. K: OK. HERE IS WHAT THE SKEPTIC IS SAYING: SOMETHING

COMES FROM NOTHING. HERE IS WHAT THE NON-SKEPTIC IS

SAYING: SOMETHING DOES NOT COME FROM NOTHING.  

NORMA JEAN: HMM. [WITH INTEREST, NOT CONTEMPT]

DR. K: THE NON-SKEPTIC SAYS: ‘WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES, THE

WORLD DOESN’T CEASE TO EXIST. WHEN I OPEN MY EYES, THE

WORD DOESN’T POP INTO EXISTENCE. AND THE REASON THAT

THE WORLD, AS IT I AFTER I OPEN MY EYES, RESEMBLE THE

WORLD, AS IT WAS BEFORE I CLOSED MY EYES, IS THAT MY

OPENING EYES DIDN’T BRING IT INTO EXISTENCE. WHAT

HAPPENED WAS THAT, INTERVENING BETWEEN THE TWO SETS

OF PERCEPTIONS---BETWEEN MY PERCEPTIONS BEFORE I

CLOSED MY EYES AND MY PERCEPTIONS AFTER I OPENED MY

  EYES---INTERVENING BETWEEN THOSE TWO SETS OF

PERCEPTIONS, THERE WAS SOME CONTINUOUSLY EXISTINGREALITY.

NORMA JEAN: SOME CONTINUOUSLY EXISTING REALITY OF

WHICH YOU ARE ONLY INTERMITTENTLY AWARE.

DR. K: EXACTLY.

NORMA JEAN: THIS IS INTERESTING, DR K. USUALLY WHEN

SKEPTICS PITCH THEIR POSITION---WHEN THEY SAY THAT IT IS

AS LIKELY AS NOT THAT ONE’S PERCEPTIONS ARE

HALLUCINATIONS---THEY FOCUS ON ONE’S PERCEPTIONS AT A

GIVEN INSTANT. THEY SAY: ‘GIVEN YOUR CURRENT

PERCEPTIONS, IT IS AS LIKELY AS NOT THAT THOSE

PERCEPTIONS ARE MERE HALLUCINATIONS.’ BUT THEY TEND TO

IGNORE THE QUESTION: ‘HOW DO EXPLAIN THE FACT THAT MY

CURRENT PERCEPTIONS COHERENT WITH MY PAST

PERCEPTIONS?’

DR. K: THAT’S RIGHT, NORMA JEAN. AND THEY ALSO IGNORE

THE QUESTION: ‘HOW DO I EXPLAIN THE FACT THAT MY

PERCEPTIONS AT A GIVEN A TIME ARE INTERNALLY

COHERENT?’

NORMA JEAN: EXPLAIN.

DR. K: THERE ARE MANY DIMENSIONS ALONG WHICH THE

TOTALITY OF ONE’S SENSORY EXPERIENCE IS INTERNALLY

COHERENT. RIGHT NOW, I DON’T JUST SEE THE CAR, I ALSO

HEAR IT.I DON’T SEE SMELL THE FOOD I’M EATING. I ALSO

TASTE IT. ONE’S SENSORY EXPERIENCE AT A GIVEN TIME IS

ENORMOUSLY COMPLEX; IT HAS MANY, MAY COMPONENTS.

EACH OF THOSE COMPONENTS COHERES WITH COMPONENTS OF

PAST SENSORY EXPERIENCES; AND THOS COMPONENTS

COHERENT WITH ONE ANOTHER. AND THESE RELATIONS OF

COHERENCE THEMSELVES COHERE!

NORMA JEAN: PLEASE EXPLAIN THAT LAST POINT.

DR. K: IT ISN’T SIMPLY THAT OUR SENSORY EXPERIENCES

COHERE WITH ONE ANOTHER.  IT IS ALSO THAT THE WAYS IN

WHICH THEY COHERE WITH ONE ANOTHER TEND TO REMAIN

CONSISTENT.

NORMA JEAN: I SEE. OUR EXPERIENCES CHANGE. BUT THE LAWSGOVERNING THOSE CCHANGES TEND TO BE STABLE.

DR. K: RIGHT. AND THOSE VARIOUS COHERENCE-RELATIONS

MUST COHERE WITH ANOTHER.

NORMA JEAN: I SEE. ONE’S SENSORY  EXPERIENCE  AT A GIVEN

TIME IS INTERNALLY DIFFERENTIATED; IT IS COMPLEX. AND

EACH COMPONENT, EACH NUANCE, OF THAT EXPEIRENCE

COHERES WITH A CORRESPONING NUANCE SOME EARLIER

EXPERIENCE. AND EACH OF THOSE COHERENCE-RELATIONS

MUST COHERE WITH ONE ANOTHER. IN OTHER WORDS, THE

TOTALITY OF THESE COHERENCE RELATIONS MUST BE

COHERENT. OTHERWISE, THE TOTALITY OF ONE’S SENSORY

EXPERIENCES AT A GIVEN TIME WILL FAIL TO COHERE WITH

THE TOALITY OF ONE’S SENSORY EXPERIENCES AT SOME

EARLIER TIME.

DR. K: AND THOSE TOTALITIES NOT ONLY COHERE WITH EACH

OTHER, BUT ALSO WITH OTHER, SIMILAR TOTALITIES. AND THE

  FCOHERENCE-RELATION HOLDING AMONG THE FIRST TOTALITY

MUST COHERE WITH THE COHERENT-RELATION HOLDING

AMONG THESE OTHER TOALITIES. 

NORMA JEAN: I SEE. AND UNLESS THERE ARE RELATIONS OF

CAUSATION HOLDING AMONG THESE VARIOUS EXPERIENCES---

UNLESS TYE ARE CAUSALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE ANOTHER---

EACH MOMENT OF ANY GIVEN PERSON’S WAKING EXISTENCE IS

A COINCIDENCE WITHIN A COINCIDENCE WITHIN A

CONCIDENCE, AD INFINITUM.

DR. K: EXACTLY. AND THE ESSENCE OF CAUSATION IS

CONTINUITY. 

NORMA JEAN RIGHT. BECAUSE WHERE THERE ARE GAPS,

THINGS HAVE TO POP INTO EXISTENCE OUT OF NOTHING.

DR. K: RIGHT, WHERE THERE IS DISCONINTUITY—WHERE

OTHERWISE CONTINUOUS SERIES ARE SEVERED—RESUMPTIONS

OF EXISTENCE MUST IPSO FACTO COME OUT OF NOWHERE.

THEY MUST BE UNCAUSED.

NORMA JEAN: AND CONTRARIWISE, WHERE THEY ARE CAUSED,

THERE MUST BE CONTINUITY.DR. K: EXACTLY.

NORMA JEAN: AND THE REQUISITE CONTINUITIES ARE NOT

ALWAYS PROVIDED BY OUR SENSORY EXPERIENCES

THEMSELVES.

DR. K: EXACTLY.

NORMA JEAN: AND WE POSIT THE EXTERNAL WORLD TO FILL IN

THESE GAPS.

DR. K: EXACTLY.

NORMA JEAN TO ‘DE-COINCIDENTAL-IZE’ OUR SENSORY

EXPERIENCES.

DR. K: CORRECT. BUT IT DOESN’T STOP THERE.

NORMA JEAN: IT DOESN’T?

DR. K: NO. SUPPOSE THAT IN ORDER TO PLUG HOPE SOME HOLE

IN OUR SENSORY EXPERIENCE, WE POSIT SOME EXTENRAL

OBJECT OR EVENT. LET H1 BE THAT HYPOTHESIS OF OURS. AND

SUPPOSE THAT, ON SOME OTHER OCCASION, WE POSIT SOME

EXTERNAL STATE OF AFFAIRS TO PLUG UP SOME OTHER HOLE

IN OUR SENSORY EXPERIENCE. LET H2 BE THAT HYPOTHESIS OF

OURS.

NORMA JEAN: I SEE WHERE YOU’RE GOING, DR. K. H1 AND H2

HAVE TO COHERE WITH EACH OTEHR.

DR. K: RIGHT. IT IS NOT ENOUGH THAT EACH SUFFICE TO PLUG

UP THE PARTICULAR HOLE THAT WE POSITED IT TO PLUG UP. IT

IS ALSO NECESSARY THAT THESE TWO PLUGS, FOR LACK OF A

BETTER WORD, COHERE WITH EACH OTHER.

NORMA JEAN: AND EACH OF THOSE ‘PLUGS’---EACH OF THOSE

STOP-GAPS---MUST COHERE WITH INNUMERALY ANY OTHER

SUCH STOP-GAPS.

DR. K: AND EACH OF THOSE COHERENCE-RELATIONS MUST

COHERE WITH EACH OF THE OTHERS.

NORMA JEAN: NOW I SEE, DR. K. ANY GIVEN ONE SENSORY

EXPERIENCE CONSISTS OF A MANY PARTS, WHICH COHERE

WITH EACH OTHER. THIS MEANS THAT, WHENEVER TWO

SENSORY EXPERIENCES COHERE WITH OTHER, A MILLION

SUBSIDIARY COHERENCE-RELATIONS ARE INVOLVED. ANDWHEN THREE SENSORY EXPERIENCES ARE INVOLVED, A

MILLION UPON A MILLION COHERENCE-RELATIONS ARE

INVOVLED. AND WHEN NEW SENSORY EXPERIENCES ARE

ADDED, NEW KINDS OF COHERENCE ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE

THE COHERENCE OF THESE COHERENCE RELTIONS. AND IT

NEVERS ENDS.

DR. K: EXACTLY. AND UNLESS THERE ARE UNPERCEIVED

REALITIES MEDIATING BETWEEN OUR PERCEPTIONS,

GUARANTEEING THE RELEVANT CONTINUITIES….

NORMA JEAN: THEN ANY MOMENT OF ONE’S WAKING

EXPERIENCE---ANY GIVEN APSECT OF ONE’S WAKING

EXPERIENCE—IS A COINCIDENTAL CONVERGENCE OF A

MILLION COINCIDENTAL CONVERGENCE OF A MILLION

COINCIDENTAL CONERGING COINCIDENCES.

DR. K: RIGHT.

NORMA JEAN: CONTRARIWISE, UNLESS EACH ASPECT OF EACH

INSTANCE OF ONE’S WAKING LIFE IS JUST ONE BIG MUTIPLICITY

OF COINCIDENCES, THERE MUST BE UNPERCEIVED EXTERNAL

REALITIES MEDIATING BETWEEN OUR SENSORY EXPERIENCES.

DR. K: EXACTLY.

NORMA JEAN: AND UNLESS

NOW, LET ME ASK YOU, NORMA JEAN, WHAT IS IT TO MODEL A

DATA-SET? WHAT IS IT TO ACCOUNT FOR A BODY OF DATA?

NORMA JEAN: IT IS TO PRODUCE A HYPOTHESIS THAT MAKES A

NON-COINCIDENCE OF THAT DATA.

DR. K: RIGHT. AND THE NON-SKEPTIC IS SAYING: GIVEN THE

SENSORY DATA THAT WE HAVE, THE SUPPOSITION THAT THERE

IS SOMETHING UNPERCEIVED---

NORMA JEAN: SOMEHICH WHICH, BY DEFINITION, IS SOMETHING

EXTERNAL TO OUR PERCEPTIONS…

DR. K: RIGHT.

NORMA: SOMETHING WHICH, BY DEFINITION, IS AN EXTERNAL

WORLD…

DR. K: EXACTLY. ALL THE NON-SKEPTIC IS SAYING IS THAT THE

SENSORY DATA IS BETTER MODELED BY POSITING SOMETHINGADDITIONAL TO OUR PERCEPTIOSN THAN IT IS BY SUPPOSING

THAT OUR SENSE-PERCEPTIONS ARE ALL THERE IS.

NORMA JEAN: WHICH IS PRACTICALLY A TAUTOLOGY, SINCE TO

MODEL A DATA-SET---TO EXPLAIN THE DATA, IN OTHER WORDS-

--TO DO THAT JUST IS TO POSIT SOMETHING ADDITIONAL TO THE

DATA TO ACCONT FOR THE DATA.

DR. K: PRECISELY.

NORMA JEAN: AND THE SKEPTIC’S POSITION IS AS CLOSE TO

BEING TAUTOLOGOUSLY FALSE AS THE NON-SKEPTIC’S

POSITION IS TO BEING TAUTOLOGOUSLY TRUE.

DR. K: EXACTLY. THE SKEPTIC IS SAYING THAT OUR SENSORY

EXPERIENCES ARE JUST AS WELL ACOUNTED BY FOR BY THE

SUPPOSITION THAT THERE IS NO EXTENRAL WORLD AS IT IS BY

THE SUPPOSITION THAT THERE IS AN EXTENRAL WORLD.

NORMA JEAN: WHICH COLLAPSES INTO THE ABSURDITY THAT

OUR SENSORY EXPERIENCES ARE JUST AS WELL EXPLAINED BY

THE SUPPOSITION THAT OUR SENSORY EXPERIENCES ARE JUST

AS WELL EXPLAINED BY THE SUPPOSITINO THAT THERE IS

SOMETHING ADDITIONAL TO THEM AS THEY ARE BY THE

SUPPOSITION THAT DOES NOT EXIST ANYTHING ADDITIONAL TO

THEM.

DR. K: EXACTLY .

NORMA JEAN: WHICH IS PRACTICALLY A TAUTOLOGICAL

FALSEHOOD, GIVEN THAT TO MODEL A DATA SET IS POSIT

SOMETHING ADDITIONAL TO THAT DATA SET THAT PURGES ALL

OF THE COINCIDENCES FROM THE DATA-SET’S EXISTENCE.

DR. K: EXACTY.

NORMA JEAN: ALL OF WHICH IS INTUTIVELY OBVIOUSLY.

DR. K: RIGHT. NOT EASY TO ARITCULATE.

NORMA JEAN: RIGHT. NOT EASY TO KNOW IN A COMPLETELY

EXPLICIT, CONSCIOUS, DISCURSIVE MANNER.

DR. K: BUT STILL, AS YOU SAID, INTUITIVELY OBVIOUS.

NORMA JEAN: INSTINCTIVELY OBVIOUS, IN OTHER WORDS.

WHICH IS WHY, WITH A FEW DUBIOUS EXCEPTIONS, HUMAN

BEINGS ARE NOT SKEPTICS.DR. K: AND WHICH IS ALL CREATURES ARE NON-SKEPTICS,

UNLESS POISONED BY THEIR SOPHISMS.

NORMA JEAN: WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION, WHY ARE THERE

SO MANY SKEPTICS OUT THERE? WHAT IS SKEPTICISM ABOUT?

THE RELATIVE POPULARITY OF SKEPTICISM OBVIOUSLY HAS

NOTHING TO DO WITH ITS LOGICAL OR EPSITEMOLOGICAL

MERITS. SO WHENCE THE POPULARITY OF SKEPTICISM?

DR. K: SKEPTICISM HAS FIVE ROOTS. FIRST, THERE IS THE

COWARDICE FACTOR.

NORMA JEAN: YOU MEAN, THE SELF-DESCRIBED SKEPTIC IS

MAKING HIMSELF NON-THREATENING BY SAYING ‘I DON’T

KNOW ANYTING. SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL, SPEAK NO EVIL.’

DR. K: EXACTLY. THE THREE MONKEYS.

NORMA JEAN: WHAT IS FACTOR NUMBER TWO?

DR. K: THE SKEPTIC CANNOT PRODUCE ANY MATERIAL OF HIS

OWN. AND BY BEING A SKEPTIC HE HAS AN AUTOMATIC WAY

OF TEARING DOWN ANYONE WHO CAN PRODUCE MATERIAL. HE

CAN JUST SAY TO THAT PERSON: YOU DON’T KNOW, BECAUSE

NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING.

NORMA JEAN: I SEE. SO IN REALITY, THE SKEPTIC IS SIMPLY

SOMEBODY WHO HAS NO MATERIAL, WHO HAS NOTHING TO

DAY. BUT FOR REASONS OF EGO, HE OBVIOUSLY WON’T COP TO

THE FACT THAT HE IS A MENTAL CRIPPLE. SO HE SAYS THAT HIS

INTELLECTUAL QUADRIPLEGIA IS RATIONALITY. HE SAYS ‘I’M

NOT AN INTELLECTUAL CRIPPLE; I’M NOT CREATIVELY BARREN.

I’M JUST RATIONAL. I DON’T OVERDRAW CONCLUSIONS. BUT

THE PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE IDEAS---THE ONES WHO ARE NOT

COMPLETE AND TOTAL WOOD---THEY ARE THE INTELLECTUAL

CRIPPLES; FOR THEY ARE THE ONES WHO OVER DRAW THE

CONCLUSION. THEY ARE THE ONES WITH THE DEFICITS, NOT

ME.’

DR. K: EXACTLY. EXACTLY.

NORMA JEAN: SO THE SKEPTIC IS BOTH A COWARD AND A

MALICIOUS UNDERMINING SABATOEUR.

DR. K: THAT’S RIGHT.NORMA JEAN: AND ARE YOU SAYING THIS A PRIORI? IN OTHER

WORDS, ARE YOU DEDUCING THIS FROM THE SKEPTIC’S

POSITION? OR ARE YOU SAYING ON THE BASIS OF ACTUAL

EXPERIENCE WITH ACTUAL SKEPTICS?

DR. K: THE LATTER.

NORMA JEAN: AND WHAT IS FACTOR NUMBER THREE?

DR. K: THE DESIRE TO BE BLIND. THE WILL BLINDNESS FACTOR.

BLINDNESS TO SELF, TO BE SPECIFIC.

NORMA JEAN: PLEASE CLARIFY.

DR. K: THE SKEPTIC IS A SKEPTIC NOT BECAUSE HE CAN’T KNOW

THE TRUTH, BUT BECAUSE HE DOESN’T KNOW WANT TO KNOW

IT.

NORMA JEAN: THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT?

DR. K: THERE IS ONLY TRUTH THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF.

NORMA JEAN: THE TRUTH ABOUT ONESELF?

DR. K: YES. AND THE SKEPTIC’S OBVIOUSLY SPURIOUS

AGNOSTICISM ABOUT THE EXTERNAL WORLD IS AN INVERSION,

A DISPLACEMENT, A PROJECTION.

NORMA JEAN: YOU MEAN, HIS BLINDNESS TO THE EXTENRAL

WORLD IS BLINDNESS TO HIMSELF.

DR. K: RIGHT. HIS FEIGNED BLINDNESS TO THE EXTENRAL

WORLD—THE BLINDNESS THAT HE PRETENDS  TO HAVE TO THE

EXTENRAL WORLD, BUT DOESN’T---IS BLINDNESS THAT HE

WANTS TO HAVE OF THE INTERNAL WORLD.

NORMA JEAN: BUT WHY CAN’T THE SKEPTIC JUST SAY: ‘I KNOW

ABOUT THE EXTERNAL WORLD, BUT I DON’T KNOW ABOUT THE

INTERNAL WORLD. I’M BLIND TO MYSELF.’ WHY CAN’T HE JUST

SAY THAT? WHY DOES HE HAVE TO PROJECT?

DR. K: YOU JUST ANSWERED YOUR OWN QUESTION.

NORMA JEAN: TOUCHÉ, DR. K. AND FACTOR NUMBER FOUR?

DR. K: THE SKEPTIC DOUBTS HIMELF. BUT HE CAN’T ADMIT HIS

SELF-DOUBT TO HIMSELF. SO HE DISPLACES IT INTO THE

EXTERNAL WORD.

NORMA JEAN: YOU MEAN, HIS SUPPOSED DOUBTS ABOUT THE

EXTENRAL WROLD ARE PROJECTIVE DOUBTS ABOUT HIMSELF.DR. K: YES, AND THE LATTER, UNLIKE THE FORMER, ARE REAL.

NORMA JEAN: AND FACTOR NUMBER FIVE?

DR. K: THE LAZINESS FACTOR. IT IS EASIER TO DOUBT THAN IT IS

TO DO. ANY IDIOT CAN FIND A MILLION REASONS WHY SOME

POSITION IS WRONG. ANYONE CAN GIVE YOU A MILLION

RESAONS WHY SOME PROJECT WON’T WORK. THE THING IS, IF

YOU ADMIT THAT A PROJECT MIGHT WORK, THEN YOU

ACTUALY HAVE TO ACT. YOU CAN’T JUST SIT ON YOUR DIME.

YOU HAVE TO WORK. YOU HAVE TO STICK YOUR NECK OUT.

YOU HAVE TO PUT YOURSELF ON THE LINE.

NORMA JEAN: SO THE SKEPTIC IS TOO WEAK AND TIMID AND

JUST PLAIN BROKEN TO UNDERTAKE ANYTHING. SO INSTEAD HE

FINDS REASONS WHY PROJECTS WON’T WORK. WHICH HE HAS

TO RATIONALIZE IN TERMS OF A GENERALIZED NEGATIVISM, A

GENERLIAZED BELIEF TO THE EFFECT THAT ALL AFFIRMATIVE

BELIEFS ARE FALSE.

DR. K: EXACTLY. HE IS TURNING HIS BROKENNESS AND LACK OF

WILL INTO A MERIT. HE IS CLAIMING THAT IT IS LOGIC AND

PRUDENCE ON HIS PART.

NORMA JEAN: WHICH IT IS, BUT ONLY IF LOOKED IT IN A VERY

NARROW AND SHORT TERM WAY. ONLY IF LOOKED AT

RELATIVE TO VERY CONSERVATIVE AND COWARDLY AND,

ULTIMATELY, SELF-UNDERMINNG BENCHMARKS.

DR. K: EXACTLY. AND HE IS TURNING THE OTHER PERSON’S

  NON-BROKENNESS—THE OTHER PERSON’S WILLINGNESS AND

ABILITYT TO ACT---HE IS TURNING THAT INTO A DEFICIT.

NORMA JEAN: SO ONCE AGAIN, WE SEE THE SKEPTIC BLAMING

OTHERS FOR HIS FAULTS AND TAKING CREDIT FOR OTHER

PEOPLE’S MERITS.

DR. K: WHICH IS PART OF AN EVEN LARGER TENDENCY TO

PROJET AND INVERT. HIS SUPPOSED BLINDNESS TO THE

EXTERNAL WORLD IS REALLY DESIRED BLINDNESS TO THE

INTERNAL WORLD.

NORMA JEAN: AND HIS VERY REAL DOUBTS ABOUT HIMSELF

ARE THEN INVERTED AND TURNED INTO DOUBTS ABOUT THEEXTERNAL WORLD.

DR. K: SO YOU HOW EVERYTHING ABOUT SKETPICISM IS A LIE.

NORMA JEAN: A MALICIOUS LIE, TOLD BY STUNTED

WEAKLINGS, WHO WANT TO EVADE RESPONSIBILITY AND THEN

BLAME OTHERS FOR THEIR OWN FAILINGS.

DR. K: WHICH, BEING THE PREFERRED COURSE OF ACTION—OR

OF INACTION, RATHER---OF SUCH A LARGE PART OF THE

POPULATION, EXPLAINS WHY, DESPIRE ITS UTTER LACK OF

LOGICAL INTEGRITY, SKEPTICISM IS SO POPULAR.

NORMA JEAN: BRAVO, DR. K. BRAVO.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                   What is Justice?

 

  MAX: What is justice?

 

Dr. K.: What the cause-effect relation is to the state of nature, justice is to

society.

 

  MAX: I do not understand.

 

Dr. K: When the individual lives outside of any organized community, and

it is simply man against the world, there are actions on his part, and those

actions have consequences. Sometimes those consequences are good, and

sometimes they are bad. But when they are bad, the agent is not being done

an injustice. He is experiencing a misfortune, but he is not the victim of an

injustice.

But when people organize together, so as to make it easier for themselves

to deal with adversity, the extentto which the individual’s fortunes depend on

nature herself are greatly lessened, and the extent to which they depend on

the behavior of other human beings is greatly increased. 

 

  MAX: I follow. Please continue.

 

Dr. K: In the state of nature, it is every man for himself. And this

arrangement, for lack of a better word, doesn’t work very well. So people

band together, and they cooperate, the result being that they work less and get

more from their work and, moreover, they live longer.

 

  MAX: That sounds right. 

Dr. K: The flip side is that people rely on other people. When man was on

his own, he did not need anybody. He received no help from others, which

was bad, but he needed no help from others, which was good. Overall, his

quality of life was low, which is why he joined up with others and formed an

organized community. But he was never dependent on anyone other than

himself.

 

  MAX: I am with you. Continue please.

 

Dr. K: But when he is part of an organized community, he is dependent on

others. The understanding is that other people will uphold their

responsibilities to him, provided he does the same for them. In this way,

people’s relations to one another, which are characterized by a certain level

of emotional warmth, replace the individual’s relation to nature, which is cold

and unfeeling, depending as it does only on the laws of physics, and not

being softened by human kindness.

 

  MAX: I understand.

 

Dr. K: The problem is that, whereas the laws of physics are 100% reliable,

human beings are not. When the individual is alone, in nature, he has a 100%

guarantee that, if he performs the right actions, he will get the right result.

Nature will keep her end of the bargain. But when a person is part of an

organized community, he can do what he is supposed to do, and people can

simply decide not to honor their obligations to him.

 

  MAX: I am beginning to understand. 

Dr. K: And when a person fails to uphold his obligations to another person,

it is an injustice.

 

  MAX: Whereas, when nature deals a man a cruel blow, it is simply a

misfortune.

 

Dr. K: Right, when one is dealing with relations of cause and effect, as

opposed to moral obligation, there is always perfect reciprocity. For every

action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. But in an organized

community, this is not the case. One can comply with one’s obligations, on

the expectation that he will compensated accordingly; but that does not mean

that he will compensated accordingly.

 

  MAX: Right, the people who owe him may decide to burn his house down,

instead of paying him.

 

Dr. K: Exactly. Because agreements with other people are artificial

arrangements, they are not characterized by the perfect constancy of natural

law.

 

  MAX: I see. In a state of nature, man’s situation is grim, and his prospects

are bleak; but he knows that he will always get what he pays for, so to speak.

When he is in an organized community, his situation is pretty good on the

whole, and his are opportunities plentiful; but he does not always get what he

pays for, quite literally.

 

Dr. K: Exactly. 

  MAX: And when he does get what he pays for, that is justice.

 

Dr. K: Right.

 

  MAX: And when he doesn’t, it is injustice.

 

Dr. K: Excellent. See you tomorrow, Max.
