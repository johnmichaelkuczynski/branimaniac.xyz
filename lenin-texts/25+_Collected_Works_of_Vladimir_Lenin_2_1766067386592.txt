Vladimir 
Ilyich 
Ulyanov, 
better 
known 
as 
Vladimir 
Lenin, 
was 
a 
Russian 
revolutionary, 
politician, 
and 
political 
theorist. 
He 
served 
as 
the 
first 
and 
founding 
head 
of 
government 
of 
Soviet 
Russia 
from 
1917 
to 
1924 
and 
of 
the 
Soviet 
Union 
from 
1922 
to 
1924. 
Under 
his 
administration, 
Russia, 
and 
later 
the 
Soviet 
Union, 
became 
a 
one-party 
socialist 
state 
governed 
by 
the 
Communist 
Party. 
Ideologically 
a 
Marxist, 
his 
developments 
to 
the 
ideology 
are 
called 
Leninism. 


Russia 
in 
the 
Shadows 
is 
a 
book 
by 
H. 
G. 
Wells 
published 
early 
in 
1921, 
which 
includes 
a 
series 
of 
articles 
previously 
printed 
in 
The 
Sunday 
Express 
in 
connection 
with 
Wells's 
second 
visit 
to 
Russia 
(after 
a 
previous 
trip 
in 
January 
1914 
to 
St. 
Petersburg 
and 
Moscow) 
in 
September 
and 
October 
1920. 


During 
his 
visit 
to 
Russia 
he 
visited 
his 
old 
friend 
Maxim 
Gorky, 
whom 
he 
had 
first 
met 
in 
1906 
on 
a 
trip 
to 
the 
United 
States, 
and 
who 
arranged 
Wells's 
meeting 
with 
Lenin. 


In 
a 
chapter 
(The 
Dreamer 
in 
the 
Kremlin) 
devoted 
to 
an 
interview 
with 
Lenin 
at 
the 
Kremlin 
Wells 
describes 
the 
leader 
and 
founder 
of 
Russian 
communism. 
Wells 
portrays 
Lenin 
as 
a 
pragmatic 
leader 
who 
"has 
recently 
stripped 
off 
the 
last 
pretence 
that 
the 
Russian 
revolution 
is 
anything 
more 
than 
the 
inauguration 
of 
an 
age 
of 
limitless 
experiment."

Preface 
to 
the 
First 
Edition 


The 
question 
of 
the 
state 
is 
now 
acquiring 
particular 
importance 
both 
in 
theory 
and 
in 
practical 
politics. 
The 
imperialist 
war 
has 
immensely 
accelerated 
and 
intensified 
the 
process 
of 
transformation 
of 
monopoly 
capitalism 
into 
state-monopoly 
capitalism. 
The 
monstrous 
oppression 
of 
the 
working 
people 
by 
the 
state, 
which 
is 
merging 
more 
and 
more 
with 
the 
all-
powerful 
capitalist 
associations, 
is 
becoming 
increasingly 
monstrous. 
The 
advanced 
countries 
-we 
mean 
their 
hinterland 
-are 
becoming 
military 
convict 
prisons 
for 
the 
workers. 


The 
unprecedented 
horrors 
and 
miseries 
of 
the 
protracted 
war 
are 
making 
the 
people's 
position 
unbearable 
and 
increasing 
their 
anger. 
The 
world 
proletarian 
revolution 
is 
clearly 
maturing. 
The 
question 
of 
its 
relation 
to 
the 
state 
is 
acquiring 
practical 
importance. 


The 
elements 
of 
opportunism 
that 
accumulated 
over 
the 
decades 
of 
comparatively 
peaceful 
development 
have 
given 
rise 
to 
the 
trend 
of 
social-
chauvinism 
which 
dominated 
the 
official 
socialist 
parties 
throughout 
the 
world. 
This 
trend 
-socialism 
in 
words 
and 
chauvinism 
in 
deeds 
(Plekhanov, 
Potresov, 
Breshkovskaya, 
Rubanovich, 
and, 
in 
a 
slightly 
veiled 
form, 
Tsereteli, 
Chernov 
and 
Co. 
in 
Russia; 
Scheidemann. 
Legien, 
David 
and 
others 
in 
Germany; 
Renaudel, 
Guesde 
and 
Vandervelde 
in 
France 
and 
Belgium; 
Hyndman 
and 
the 
Fabians 
in 
England, 
etc., 
etc.) 
-is 
conspicuous 
for 
the 
base, 
servile 
adaptation 
of 
the 
"leaders 
of 
socialism" 
to 
the 
interests 
not 
only 
of 
"their" 
national 
bourgeoisie, 
but 
of 
"their" 
state, 
for 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
so-called 
Great 
Powers 
have 
long 
been 
exploiting 
and 
enslaving 
a 
whole 
number 
of 
small 
and 
weak 
nations. 
And 
the 
imperialist 
war 
is 
a 
war 
for 
the 
division 
and 
redivision 
of 
this 
kind 
of 
booty. 
The 
struggle 
to 
free 
the 
working 
people 
from 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie 
in 
general, 
and 
of 
the 
imperialist 
bourgeoisie 
in 
particular, 
is 
impossible 
without 
a 
struggle 
against 
opportunist 
prejudices 
concerning 
the 
"state". 


First 
of 
all 
we 
examine 
the 
theory 
of 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
of 
the 
state, 
and 
dwell 
in 
particular 
detail 
on 
those 
aspects 
of 
this 
theory 
which 
are 
ignored 
or 
have 
been 
distorted 
by 
the 
opportunists. 
Then 
we 
deal 
specially 
with 
the 
one 
who 
is 
chiefly 
responsible 
for 
these 
distortions, 
Karl 
Kautsky, 
the 
best-known 
leader 
of 
the 
Second 
International 
(1889-1914), 
which 
has 
met 
with 
such 
miserable 
bankruptcy 
in 
the 
present 
war. 
Lastly, 
we 
sum 
up 
the 
main 
results 



of 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
Russian 
revolutions 
of 
1905 
and 
particularly 
of 
1917. 
Apparently, 
the 
latter 
is 
now 
(early 
August 
1917) 
completing 
the 
first 
stage 
of 
its 
development; 
but 
this 
revolution 
as 
a 
whole 
can 
only 
be 
understood 
as 
a 
link 
in 
a 
chain 
of 
socialist 
proletarian 
revolutions 
being 
caused 
by 
the 
imperialist 
war. 
The 
question 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
socialist 
proletarian 
revolution 
to 
the 
state, 
therefore, 
is 
acquiring 
not 
only 
practical 
political 
importance, 
but 
also 
the 
significance 
of 
a 
most 
urgent 
problem 
of 
the 
day, 
the 
problem 
of 
explaining 
to 
the 
masses 
what 
they 
will 
have 
to 
do 
before 
long 
to 
free 
themselves 
from 
capitalist 
tyranny.

The 
State: 
A 
Product 
of

Antagonisms 
What 
is 
now 
happening 
to 
Marx's 
theory 
has, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
history, 
happened 
repeatedly 
to 
the 
theories 
of 
revolutionary 
thinkers 
and 
leaders 
of 
oppressed 
classes 
fighting 
for 
emancipation. 
During 
the 
lifetime 
of 
great 
revolutionaries, 
the 
oppressing 
classes 
constantly 
hounded 
them, 
received 
their 
theories 
with 
the 
most 
savage 
malice, 
the 
most 
furious 
hatred 
and 
the 
most 
unscrupulous 
campaigns 
of 
lies 
and 
slander. 
After 
their 
death, 
attempts 
are 
made 
to 
convert 
them 
into 
harmless 
icons, 
to 
canonize 
them, 
so 
to 
say, 
and 
to 
hallow 
their 
names 
to 
a 
certain 
extent 
for 
the 
“consolation” 
of 
the 
oppressed 
classes 
and 
with 
the 
object 
of 
duping 
the 
latter, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
robbing 
the 
revolutionary 
theory 
of 
its 
substance, 
blunting 
its 
revolutionary 
edge 
and 
vulgarizing 
it. 
Today, 
the 
bourgeoisie 
and 
the 
opportunists 
within 
the 
labor 
movement 
concur 
in 
this 
doctoring 
of 
Marxism. 
They 
omit, 
obscure, 
or 
distort 
the 
revolutionary 
side 
of 
this 
theory, 
its 
revolutionary 
soul. 
They 
push 
to 
the 
foreground 
and 
extol 
what 
is 
or 
seems 
acceptable 
to 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
All 
the 
social-chauvinists 
are 
now 
“Marxists” 
(don't 
laugh!). 
And 
more 
and 
more 
frequently 
German 
bourgeois 
scholars, 
only 
yesterday 
specialists 
in 
the 
annihilation 
of 
Marxism, 
are 
speaking 
of 
the 
“national-German” 
Marx, 
who, 
they 
claim, 
educated 
the 
labor 
unions 
which 
are 
so 
splendidly 
organized 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
waging 
a 
predatory 
war! 


In 
these 
circumstances, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
unprecedently 
wide-spread 
distortion 
of 
Marxism, 
our 
prime 
task 
is 
to 
re-establish 
what 
Marx 
really 



taught 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
state. 
This 
will 
necessitate 
a 
number 
of 
long 
quotations 
from 
the 
works 
of 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
themselves. 
Of 
course, 
long 
quotations 
will 
render 
the 
text 
cumbersome 
and 
not 
help 
at 
all 
to 
make 
it 
popular 
reading, 
but 
we 
cannot 
possibly 
dispense 
with 
them. 
All, 
or 
at 
any 
rate 
all 
the 
most 
essential 
passages 
in 
the 
works 
of 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
state 
must 
by 
all 
means 
be 
quoted 
as 
fully 
as 
possible 
so 
that 
the 
reader 
may 
form 
an 
independent 
opinion 
of 
the 
totality 
of 
the 
views 
of 
the 
founders 
of 
scientific 
socialism, 
and 
of 
the 
evolution 
of 
those 
views, 
and 
so 
that 
their 
distortion 
by 
the 
“Kautskyism” 
now 
prevailing 
may 
be 
documentarily 
proved 
and 
clearly 
demonstrated. 


Let 
us 
being 
with 
the 
most 
popular 
of 
Engels' 
works, 
The 
Origin 
of 
the 
Family, 
Private 
Property 
and 
the 
State, 
the 
sixth 
edition 
of 
which 
was 
published 
in 
Stuttgart 
as 
far 
back 
as 
1894. 
We 
have 
to 
translate 
the 
quotations 
from 
the 
German 
originals, 
as 
the 
Russian 
translations, 
while 
very 
numerous, 
are 
for 
the 
most 
part 
either 
incomplete 
or 
very 
unsatisfactory. 


Summing 
up 
his 
historical 
analysis, 
Engels 
says: 


“The 
state 
is, 
therefore, 
by 
no 
means 
a 
power 
forced 
on 
society 
from 
without; 
just 
as 
little 
is 
it 
'the 
reality 
of 
the 
ethical 
idea', 
'the 
image 
and 
reality 
of 
reason', 
as 
Hegel 
maintains. 
Rather, 
it 
is 
a 
product 
of 
society 
at 
a 
certain 
stage 
of 
development; 
it 
is 
the 
admission 
that 
this 
society 
has 
become 
entangled 
in 
an 
insoluble 
contradiction 
with 
itself, 
that 
it 
has 
split 
into 
irreconcilable 
antagonisms 
which 
it 
is 
powerless 
to 
dispel. 
But 
in 
order 
that 
these 
antagonisms, 
these 
classes 
with 
conflicting 
economic 
interests, 
might 
not 
consume 
themselves 
and 
society 
in 
fruitless 
struggle, 
it 
became 
necessary 
to 
have 
a 
power, 
seemingly 
standing 
above 
society, 
that 
would 
alleviate 
the 
conflict 
and 
keep 
it 
within 
the 
bounds 
of 
'order'; 
and 
this 
power, 
arisen 
out 
of 
society 
but 
placing 
itself 
above 
it, 
and 
alienating 
itself 
more 
and 
more 
from 
it, 
is 
the 
state." 
(Pp.177-78, 
sixth 
edition) 


This 
expresses 
with 
perfect 
clarity 
the 
basic 
idea 
of 
Marxism 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
historical 
role 
and 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
state. 
The 
state 
is 
a 
product 
and 
a 
manifestation 
of 
the 
irreconcilability 
of 
class 
antagonisms. 
The 
state 
arises 
where, 
when 
and 
insofar 
as 
class 
antagonism 
objectively 
cannot 
be 
reconciled. 
And, 
conversely, 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
state 
proves 
that 
the 
class 
antagonisms 
are 
irreconcilable. 


It 
is 
on 
this 
most 
important 
and 
fundamental 
point 
that 
the 
distortion 
of 
Marxism, 
proceeding 
along 
two 
main 
lines, 
begins. 


On 
the 
one 
hand, 
the 
bourgeois, 
and 
particularly 
the 
petty-bourgeois, 



ideologists, 
compelled 
under 
the 
weight 
of 
indisputable 
historical 
facts 
to 
admit 
that 
the 
state 
only 
exists 
where 
there 
are 
class 
antagonisms 
and 
a 
class 
struggle, 
“correct” 
Marx 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
make 
it 
appear 
that 
the 
state 
is 
an 
organ 
for 
the 
reconciliation 
of 
classes. 
According 
to 
Marx, 
the 
state 
could 
neither 
have 
arisen 
nor 
maintained 
itself 
had 
it 
been 
possible 
to 
reconcile 
classes. 
From 
what 
the 
petty-bourgeois 
and 
philistine 
professors 
and 
publicists 
say, 
with 
quite 
frequent 
and 
benevolent 
references 
to 
Marx, 
it 
appears 
that 
the 
state 
does 
reconcile 
classes. 
According 
to 
Marx, 
the 
state 
is 
an 
organ 
of 
class 
rule, 
an 
organ 
for 
the 
oppression 
of 
one 
class 
by 
another; 
it 
is 
the 
creation 
of 
“order”, 
which 
legalizes 
and 
perpetuates 
this 
oppression 
by 
moderating 
the 
conflict 
between 
classes. 
In 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
petty-bourgeois 
politicians, 
however, 
order 
means 
the 
reconciliation 
of 
classes, 
and 
not 
the 
oppression 
of 
one 
class 
by 
another; 
to 
alleviate 
the 
conflict 
means 
reconciling 
classes 
and 
not 
depriving 
the 
oppressed 
classes 
of 
definite 
means 
and 
methods 
of 
struggle 
to 
overthrow 
the 
oppressors. 


For 
instance, 
when, 
in 
the 
revolution 
of 
1917, 
the 
question 
of 
the 
significance 
and 
role 
of 
the 
state 
arose 
in 
all 
its 
magnitude 
as 
a 
practical 
question 
demanding 
immediate 
action, 
and, 
moreover, 
action 
on 
a 
mass 
scale, 
all 
the 
Social-Revolutionaries 
and 
Mensheviks 
descended 
at 
once 
to 
the 
petty-bourgeois 
theory 
that 
the 
“state” 
“reconciles” 
classes. 
Innumerable 
resolutions 
and 
articles 
by 
politicians 
of 
both 
these 
parties 
are 
thoroughly 
saturated 
with 
this 
petty-bourgeois 
and 
philistine 
“reconciliation” 
theory. 
That 
the 
state 
is 
an 
organ 
of 
the 
rule 
of 
a 
definite 
class 
which 
cannot 
be 
reconciled 
with 
its 
antipode 
(the 
class 
opposite 
to 
it) 
is 
something 
the 
petty-
bourgeois 
democrats 
will 
never 
be 
able 
to 
understand. 
Their 
attitude 
to 
the 
state 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
striking 
manifestations 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
our 
Socialist-
Revolutionaries 
and 
Mensheviks 
are 
not 
socialists 
at 
all 
(a 
point 
that 
we 
Bolsheviks 
have 
always 
maintained), 
but 
petty-bourgeois 
democrats 
using 
near-socialist 
phraseology. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
“Kautskyite” 
distortion 
of 
Marxism 
is 
far 
more 
subtle. 
“Theoretically”, 
it 
is 
not 
denied 
that 
the 
state 
is 
an 
organ 
of 
class 
rule, 
or 
that 
class 
antagonisms 
are 
irreconcilable. 
But 
what 
is 
overlooked 
or 
glossed 
over 
is 
this: 
if 
the 
state 
is 
the 
product 
of 
the 
irreconcilability 
of 
class 
antagonisms, 
if 
it 
is 
a 
power 
standing 
above 
society 
and 
“alienating 
itself 
more 
and 
more 
from 
it", 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
liberation 
of 
the 
oppressed 
class 
is 
impossible 
not 
only 
without 
a 
violent 
revolution, 
but 
also 
without 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
apparatus 
of 
state 
power 
which 
was 
created 
by 
the 
ruling 



class 
and 
which 
is 
the 
embodiment 
of 
this 
“alienation”. 
As 
we 
shall 
see 
later, 
Marx 
very 
explicitly 
drew 
this 
theoretically 
self-evident 
conclusion 
on 
the 
strength 
of 
a 
concrete 
historical 
analysis 
of 
the 
tasks 
of 
the 
revolution. 
And 
as 
we 
shall 
show 
in 
detail 
further 
on 
-it 
is 
this 
conclusion 
which 
Kautsky 
has 
“forgotten” 
and 
distorted. 




2. 
Special 
Bodies 
of 
Armed 
Men, 
Prisons, 
etc. 
Engels 
continues: 


“As 
distinct 
from 
the 
old 
gentile[1] 
order, 
[2] 
the 
state, 
first, 
divides 
its 
subjects 
according 
to 
territory…" 


This 
division 
seems 
“natural” 
to 
us, 
but 
it 
costs 
a 
prolonged 
struggle 
against 
the 
old 
organization 
according 
to 
generations 
or 
tribes. 


“The 
second 
distinguishing 
feature 
is 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
public 
power 
which 
no 
longer 
directly 
coincides 
with 
the 
population 
organizing 
itself 
as 
an 
armed 
force. 
This 
special, 
public 
power 
is 
necessary 
because 
a 
self-acting 
armed 
organization 
of 
the 
population 
has 
become 
impossible 
since 
the 
split 
into 
classes… 
This 
public 
power 
exists 
in 
every 
state; 
it 
consists 
not 
merely 
of 
armed 
men 
but 
also 
of 
material 
adjuncts, 
prisons, 
and 
institutions 
of 
coercion 
of 
all 
kinds, 
of 
which 
gentile[2] 
society 
knew 
nothing…" 


Engels 
elucidates 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
“power” 
which 
is 
called 
the 
state, 
a 
power 
which 
arose 
from 
society 
but 
places 
itself 
above 
it 
and 
alienates 
itself 
more 
and 
more 
from 
it. 
What 
does 
this 
power 
mainly 
consist 
of? 
It 
consists 
of 
special 
bodies 
of 
armed 
men 
having 
prisons, 
etc., 
at 
their 
command. 


We 
are 
justified 
in 
speaking 
of 
special 
bodies 
of 
armed 
men, 
because 
the 
public 
power 
which 
is 
an 
attribute 
of 
every 
state 
“does 
not 
directly 
coincide” 
with 
the 
armed 
population, 
with 
its 
“self-acting 
armed 
organization". 


Like 
all 
great 
revolutionary 
thinkers, 
Engels 
tries 
to 
draw 
the 
attention 
of 



the 
class-conscious 
workers 
to 
what 
prevailing 
philistinism 
regards 
as 
least 
worthy 
of 
attention, 
as 
the 
most 
habitual 
thing, 
hallowed 
by 
prejudices 
that 
are 
not 
only 
deep-rooted 
but, 
one 
might 
say, 
petrified. 
A 
standing 
army 
and 
police 
are 
the 
chief 
instruments 
of 
state 
power. 
But 
how 
can 
it 
be 
otherwise? 


From 
the 
viewpoint 
of 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
Europeans 
of 
the 
end 
of 
the 
19th 
century, 
whom 
Engels 
was 
addressing, 
and 
who 
had 
not 
gone 
through 
or 
closely 
observed 
a 
single 
great 
revolution, 
it 
could 
not 
have 
been 
otherwise. 
They 
could 
not 
understand 
at 
all 
what 
a 
“self-acting 
armed 
organization 
of 
the 
population” 
was. 
When 
asked 
why 
it 
became 
necessary 
to 
have 
special 
bodies 
of 
armed 
men 
placed 
above 
society 
and 
alienating 
themselves 
from 
it 
(police 
and 
a 
standing 
army), 
the 
West-European 
and 
Russian 
philistines 
are 
inclined 
to 
utter 
a 
few 
phrases 
borrowed 
from 
Spencer 
of 
Mikhailovsky, 
to 
refer 
to 
the 
growing 
complexity 
of 
social 
life, 
the 
differentiation 
of 
functions, 
and 
so 
on. 


Such 
a 
reference 
seems 
“scientific”, 
and 
effectively 
lulls 
the 
ordinary 
person 
to 
sleep 
by 
obscuring 
the 
important 
and 
basic 
fact, 
namely, 
the 
split 
of 
society 
into 
irreconcilable 
antagonistic 
classes. 


Were 
it 
not 
for 
this 
split, 
the 
“self-acting 
armed 
organization 
of 
the 
population” 
would 
differ 
from 
the 
primitive 
organization 
of 
a 
stick-wielding 
herd 
of 
monkeys, 
or 
of 
primitive 
men, 
or 
of 
men 
united 
in 
clans, 
by 
its 
complexity, 
its 
high 
technical 
level, 
and 
so 
on. 
But 
such 
an 
organization 
would 
still 
be 
possible. 


It 
is 
impossible 
because 
civilized 
society 
is 
split 
into 
antagonistic, 
and, 
moreover, 
irreconcilably 
antagonistic 
classes, 
whose 
“self-acting” 
arming 
would 
lead 
to 
an 
armed 
struggle 
between 
them. 
A 
state 
arises, 
a 
special 
power 
is 
created, 
special 
bodies 
of 
armed 
men, 
and 
every 
revolution, 
by 
destroying 
the 
state 
apparatus, 
shows 
us 
the 
naked 
class 
struggle, 
clearly 
shows 
us 
how 
the 
ruling 
class 
strives 
to 
restore 
the 
special 
bodies 
of 
armed 
men 
which 
serve 
it, 
and 
how 
the 
oppressed 
class 
strives 
to 
create 
a 
new 
organization 
of 
this 
kind, 
capable 
of 
serving 
the 
exploited 
instead 
of 
the 
exploiters. 


In 
the 
above 
argument, 
Engels 
raises 
theoretically 
the 
very 
same 
question 
which 
every 
great 
revolution 
raises 
before 
us 
in 
practice, 
palpably 
and, 
what 
is 
more, 
on 
a 
scale 
of 
mass 
action, 
namely, 
the 
question 
of 
the 
relationship 
between 
“special” 
bodies 
of 
armed 
men 
and 
the 
“self-acting 
armed 
organization 
of 
the 
population". 
We 
shall 
see 
how 
this 
question 
is 
specifically 
illustrated 
by 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
European 
and 
Russian 
revolutions. 



But 
to 
return 
to 
Engel's 
exposition. 


He 
points 
out 
that 
sometimes 
-in 
certain 
parts 
of 
North 
America, 
for 
example 
-this 
public 
power 
is 
weak 
(he 
has 
in 
mind 
a 
rare 
exception 
in 
capitalist 
society, 
and 
those 
parts 
of 
North 
America 
in 
its 
pre-imperialist 
days 
where 
the 
free 
colonists 
predominated), 
but 
that, 
generally 
speaking, 
it 
grows 
stronger: 


“It[3] 
grows 
stronger, 
however, 
in 
proportion 
as 
class 
antagonisms 
within 
the 
state 
become 
more 
acute, 
and 
as 
adjacent 
states 
become 
larger 
and 
more 
populous. 
We 
have 
only 
to 
look 
at 
our 
present-day 
Europe, 
where 
class 
struggle 
and 
rivalry 
in 
conquest 
have 
tuned 
up 
the 
public 
power 
to 
such 
a 
pitch 
that 
it 
threatens 
to 
swallow 
the 
whole 
of 
society 
and 
even 
the 
state." 


This 
was 
written 
not 
later 
than 
the 
early 
nineties 
of 
the 
last 
century, 
Engel's 
last 
preface 
being 
dated 
June 
16, 
1891. 
The 
turn 
towards 
imperialism 
-meaning 
the 
complete 
domination 
of 
the 
trusts, 
the 
omnipotence 
of 
the 
big 
banks, 
a 
grand-scale 
colonial 
policy, 
and 
so 
forth 
-was 
only 
just 
beginning 
in 
France, 
and 
was 
even 
weaker 
in 
North 
America 
and 
in 
Germany. 
Since 
then 
“rivalry 
in 
conquest” 
has 
taken 
a 
gigantic 
stride, 
all 
the 
more 
because 
by 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
second 
decade 
of 
the 
20th 
century 
the 
world 
had 
been 
completely 
divided 
up 
among 
these 
“rivals 
in 
conquest", 
i.e., 
among 
the 
predatory 
Great 
Powers. 
Since 
then, 
military 
and 
naval 
armaments 
have 
grown 
fantastically 
and 
the 
predatory 
war 
of 
1914-17 
for 
the 
domination 
of 
the 
world 
by 
Britain 
or 
Germany, 
for 
the 
division 
of 
the 
spoils, 
has 
brought 
the 
“swallowing” 
of 
all 
the 
forces 
of 
society 
by 
the 
rapacious 
state 
power 
close 
to 
complete 
catastrophe. 


Engels' 
could, 
as 
early 
as 
1891, 
point 
to 
“rivalry 
in 
conquest" 
as 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
distinguishing 
features 
of 
the 
foreign 
policy 
of 
the 
Great 
Powers, 
while 
the 
social-chauvinist 
scoundrels 
have 
ever 
since 
1914, 
when 
this 
rivalry, 
many 
time 
intensified, 
gave 
rise 
to 
an 
imperialist 
war, 
been 
covering 
up 
the 
defence 
of 
the 
predatory 
interests 
of 
“their 
own" 
bourgeoisie 
with 
phrases 
about 
“defence 
of 
the 
fatherland", 
“defence 
of 
the 
republic 
and 
the 
revolution", 
etc.! 



3. 
The 
State: 
an 
Instrument 
for 
the 
Exploitation 
of 
the 
Oppressed 
Class 
The 
maintenance 
of 
the 
special 
public 
power 
standing 
above 
society 
requires 
taxes 
and 
state 
loans. 


“Having 
pubic 
power 
and 
the 
right 
to 
levy 
taxes,” 
Engels 
writes, 
“the 
officials 
now 
stand, 
as 
organs 
of 
society, 
above 
society. 
The 
free, 
voluntary 
respect 
that 
was 
accorded 
to 
the 
organs 
of 
the 
gentile[4] 
constitution 
does 
not 
satisfy 
them, 
even 
if 
they 
could 
gain 
it…” 
Special 
laws 
are 
enacted 
proclaiming 
the 
sanctity 
and 
immunity 
of 
the 
officials. 
“The 
shabbiest 
police 
servant” 
has 
more 
“authority” 
than 
the 
representative 
of 
the 
clan, 
but 
even 
the 
head 
of 
the 
military 
power 
of 
a 
civilized 
state 
may 
well 
envy 
the 
elder 
of 
a 
clan 
the 
“unrestrained 
respect” 
of 
society. 


The 
question 
of 
the 
privileged 
position 
of 
the 
officials 
as 
organs 
of 
state 
power 
is 
raised 
here. 
The 
main 
point 
indicated 
is: 
what 
is 
it 
that 
places 
them 
above 
society? 
We 
shall 
see 
how 
this 
theoretical 
question 
was 
answered 
in 
practice 
by 
the 
Paris 
Commune 
in 
1871 
and 
how 
it 
was 
obscured 
from 
a 
reactionary 
standpoint 
by 
kautsky 
in 
1912. 


“Because 
the 
state 
arose 
from 
the 
need 
to 
hold 
class 
antagonisms 
in 
check, 
but 
because 
it 
arose, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
conflict 
of 
these 
classes, 
it 
is, 
as 
a 
rule, 
the 
state 
of 
the 
most 
powerful, 
economically 
dominant 
class, 
which, 
through 
the 
medium 
of 
the 
state, 
becomes 
also 
the 
politically 
dominant 
class, 
and 
thus 
acquires 
new 
means 
of 
holding 
down 
and 
exploiting 
the 
oppressed 
class…” 
The 
ancient 
and 
feudal 
states 
were 
organs 
for 
the 
exploitation 
of 
the 
slaves 
and 
serfs; 
likewise, 
“the 
modern 
representative 
state 
is 
an 
instrument 
of 
exploitation 
of 
wage-labor 
by 
capital. 
By 
way 
of 
exception, 
however, 
periods 
occur 
in 
which 
the 
warring 
classes 
balance 
each 
other 
so 
nearly 
that 
the 
state 
power 
as 
ostensible 
mediator 
acquires, 
for 
the 
moment, 
a 
certain 
degree 
of 
independence 
of 
both…” 
Such 
were 
the 
absolute 
monarchies 
of 
the 
17th 
and 
18th 
centuries, 
the 
Bonapartism 
of 
the 
First 
and 
Second 
Empires 
in 
France, 
and 
the 
Bismarck 
regime 
in 
Germany. 


Such, 
we 
may 
add, 
is 
the 
Kerensky 
government 
in 
republican 
Russia 
since 
it 
began 
to 
persecute 
the 
revolutionary 
proletariat, 
at 
a 
moment 
when, 
owing 
to 
the 
leadership 
of 
the 
petty-bourgeois 
democrats, 
the 
Soviets 
have 
already 
become 
impotent, 
while 
the 
bourgeoisie 
are 
not 
yet 
strong 
enough 
simply 
to 
disperse 
them. 



In 
a 
democratic 
republic, 
Engels 
continues, 
“wealth 
exercises 
its 
power 
indirectly, 
but 
all 
the 
more 
surely", 
first, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
“direct 
corruption 
of 
officials” 
(America); 
secondly, 
by 
means 
of 
an 
“alliance 
of 
the 
government 
and 
the 
Stock 
Exchange" 
(France 
and 
America). 


At 
present, 
imperialism 
and 
the 
domination 
of 
the 
banks 
have 
“developed” 
into 
an 
exceptional 
art 
both 
these 
methods 
of 
upholding 
and 
giving 
effect 
to 
the 
omnipotence 
of 
wealth 
in 
democratic 
republics 
of 
all 
descriptions. 
Since, 
for 
instance, 
in 
the 
very 
first 
months 
of 
the 
Russian 
democratic 
republic, 
one 
might 
say 
during 
the 
honeymoon 
of 
the 
“socialist” 


S.R.s 
and 
Mensheviks 
joined 
in 
wedlock 
to 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
in 
the 
coalition 
government. 
Mr. 
Palchinsky 
obstructed 
every 
measure 
intended 
for 
curbing 
the 
capitalists 
and 
their 
marauding 
practices, 
their 
plundering 
of 
the 
state 
by 
means 
of 
war 
contracts; 
and 
since 
later 
on 
Mr. 
Palchinsky, 
upon 
resigning 
from 
the 
Cabinet 
(and 
being, 
of 
course, 
replaced 
by 
another 
quite 
similar 
Palchinsky), 
was 
“rewarded” 
by 
the 
capitalists 
with 
a 
lucrative 
job 
with 
a 
salary 
of 
120,000 
rubles 
per 
annum 
-what 
would 
you 
call 
that? 
Direct 
or 
indirect 
bribery? 
An 
alliance 
of 
the 
government 
and 
the 
syndicates, 
or 
“merely” 
friendly 
relations? 
What 
role 
do 
the 
Chernovs, 
Tseretelis, 
Avksentyevs 
and 
Skobelevs 
play? 
Are 
they 
the 
“direct” 
or 
only 
the 
indirect 
allies 
of 
the 
millionaire 
treasury-looters? 
Another 
reason 
why 
the 
omnipotence 
of 
“wealth” 
is 
more 
certain 
in 
a 
democratic 
republic 
is 
that 
it 
does 
not 
depend 
on 
defects 
in 
the 
political 
machinery 
or 
on 
the 
faulty 
political 
shell 
of 
capitalism. 
A 
democratic 
republic 
is 
the 
best 
possible 
political 
shell 
for 
capitalism, 
and, 
therefore, 
once 
capital 
has 
gained 
possession 
of 
this 
very 
best 
shell 
(through 
the 
Palchinskys, 
Chernovs, 
Tseretelis 
and 
Co.), 
it 
establishes 
its 
power 
so 
securely, 
so 
firmly, 
that 
no 
change 
of 
persons, 
institutions 
or 
parties 
in 
the 
bourgeois-democratic 
republic 
can 
shake 
it. 


We 
must 
also 
note 
that 
Engels 
is 
most 
explicit 
in 
calling 
universal 
suffrage 
as 
well 
an 
instrument 
of 
bourgeois 
rule. 
Universal 
suffrage, 
he 
says, 
obviously 
taking 
account 
of 
the 
long 
experience 
of 
German 
Social-
Democracy, 
is 


“the 
gauge 
of 
the 
maturity 
of 
the 
working 
class. 
It 
cannot 
and 
never 
will 
be 
anything 
more 
in 
the 
present-day 
state." 


The 
petty-bourgeois 
democrats, 
such 
as 
our 
Socialist-Revolutionaries 
and 
Mensheviks, 
and 
also 
their 
twin 
brothers, 
all 
the 
social-chauvinists 
and 
opportunists 
of 
Western 
Europe, 
expect 
just 
this 
“more” 
from 
universal 



suffrage. 
They 
themselves 
share, 
and 
instil 
into 
the 
minds 
of 
the 
people, 
the 
false 
notion 
that 
universal 
suffrage 
“in 
the 
present-day 
state" 
is 
really 
capable 
of 
revealing 
the 
will 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
working 
people 
and 
of 
securing 
its 
realization. 


Here, 
we 
can 
only 
indicate 
this 
false 
notion, 
only 
point 
out 
that 
Engels' 
perfectly 
clear 
statement 
is 
distorted 
at 
every 
step 
in 
the 
propaganda 
and 
agitation 
of 
the 
“official” 
(i.e., 
opportunist) 
socialist 
parties. 
A 
detailed 
exposure 
of 
the 
utter 
falsity 
of 
this 
notion 
which 
engels 
brushes 
aside 
here 
is 
given 
in 
our 
further 
account 
of 
the 
views 
of 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
on 
the 
“presentday” 
state. 


Engels 
gives 
a 
general 
summary 
of 
his 
views 
in 
the 
most 
popular 
of 
his 
works 
in 
the 
following 
words: 


“The 
state, 
then, 
has 
not 
existed 
from 
all 
eternity. 
There 
have 
been 
societies 
that 
did 
without 
it, 
that 
had 
no 
idea 
of 
the 
state 
and 
state 
power. 
At 
a 
certain 
stage 
of 
economic 
development, 
which 
was 
necessarily 
bound 
up 
with 
the 
split 
of 
society 
into 
classes, 
the 
state 
became 
a 
necessity 
owing 
to 
this 
split. 
We 
are 
now 
rapidly 
approaching 
a 
stage 
in 
the 
development 
of 
production 
at 
which 
the 
existence 
of 
these 
classes 
not 
only 
will 
have 
ceased 
to 
be 
a 
necessity, 
but 
will 
become 
a 
positive 
hindrance 
to 
production. 
They 
will 
fall 
as 
they 
arose 
at 
an 
earlier 
stage. 
Along 
with 
them 
the 
state 
will 
inevitably 
fall. 
Society, 
which 
will 
reorganize 
production 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
free 
and 
equal 
association 
of 
the 
producers, 
will 
put 
the 
whole 
machinery 
of 
state 
where 
it 
will 
then 
belong: 
into 
a 
museum 
of 
antiquities, 
by 
the 
side 
of 
the 
spinning-wheel 
and 
the 
bronze 
axe." 


We 
do 
not 
often 
come 
across 
this 
passage 
in 
the 
propaganda 
and 
agitation 
literature 
of 
the 
present-day 
Social-Democrats. 
Even 
when 
we 
do 
come 
across 
it, 
it 
is 
mostly 
quoted 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
one 
bows 
before 
an 
icon, 
i.e., 
it 
is 
done 
to 
show 
official 
respect 
for 
Engels, 
and 
no 
attempt 
is 
made 
to 
gauge 
the 
breadth 
and 
depth 
of 
the 
revolution 
that 
this 
relegating 
of 
“the 
whole 
machinery 
of 
state 
to 
a 
museum 
of 
antiquities” 
implies. 
In 
most 
cases 
we 
do 
not 
even 
find 
an 
understanding 
of 
what 
Engels 
calls 
the 
state 
machine. 



4. 
The 
“Withering 
Away” 
of 
the 
State, 
and 
Violent 
Revolution 
Engel's 
words 
regarding 
the 
“withering 
away” 
of 
the 
state 
are 
so 
widely 
known, 
they 
are 
often 
quoted, 
and 
so 
clearly 
reveal 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
customary 
adaptation 
of 
Marxism 
to 
opportunism 
that 
we 
must 
deal 
with 
them 
in 
detail. 
We 
shall 
quote 
the 
whole 
argument 
from 
which 
they 
are 
taken. 


“The 
proletariat 
seizes 
from 
state 
power 
and 
turns 
the 
means 
of 
production 
into 
state 
property 
to 
begin 
with. 
But 
thereby 
it 
abolishes 
itself 
as 
the 
proletariat, 
abolishes 
all 
class 
distinctions 
and 
class 
antagonisms, 
and 
abolishes 
also 
the 
state 
as 
state. 
Society 
thus 
far, 
operating 
amid 
class 
antagonisms, 
needed 
the 
state, 
that 
is, 
an 
organization 
of 
the 
particular 
exploiting 
class, 
for 
the 
maintenance 
of 
its 
external 
conditions 
of 
production, 
and, 
therefore, 
especially, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
forcibly 
keeping 
the 
exploited 
class 
in 
the 
conditions 
of 
oppression 
determined 
by 
the 
given 
mode 
of 
production 
(slavery, 
serfdom 
or 
bondage, 
wage-labor). 
The 
state 
was 
the 
official 
representative 
of 
society 
as 
a 
whole, 
its 
concentration 
in 
a 
visible 
corporation. 
But 
it 
was 
this 
only 
insofar 
as 
it 
was 
the 
state 
of 
that 
class 
which 
itself 
represented, 
for 
its 
own 
time, 
society 
as 
a 
whole: 
in 
ancient 
times, 
the 
state 
of 
slave-owning 
citizens; 
in 
the 
Middle 
Ages, 
of 
the 
feudal 
nobility; 
in 
our 
own 
time, 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
When 
at 
last 
it 
becomes 
the 
real 
representative 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
society, 
it 
renders 
itself 
unnecessary. 
As 
soon 
as 
there 
is 
no 
longer 
any 
social 
class 
to 
be 
held 
in 
subjection, 
as 
soon 
as 
class 
rule, 
and 
the 
individual 
struggle 
for 
existence 
based 
upon 
the 
present 
anarchy 
in 
production, 
with 
the 
collisions 
and 
excesses 
arising 
from 
this 
struggle, 
are 
removed, 
nothing 
more 
remains 
to 
be 
held 
in 
subjection 
-nothing 
necessitating 
a 
special 
coercive 
force, 
a 
state. 
The 
first 
act 
by 
which 
the 
state 
really 
comes 
forward 
as 
the 
representative 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
society 
-the 
taking 
possession 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
in 
the 
name 
of 
society 
-is 
also 
its 
last 
independent 
act 
as 
a 
state. 
State 
interference 
in 
social 
relations 
becomes, 
in 
one 
domain 
after 
another, 
superfluous, 
and 
then 
dies 
down 
of 
itself. 
The 
government 
of 
persons 
is 
replaced 
by 
the 
administration 
of 
things, 
and 
by 
the 
conduct 
of 
processes 
of 
production. 
The 
state 
is 
not 
'abolished'. 
It 
withers 
away. 
This 
gives 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
value 
of 
the 
phrase 
'a 
free 
people's 
state', 
both 
as 
to 
its 
justifiable 
use 
for 
a 
long 
time 
from 
an 
agitational 
point 
of 
view, 
and 
as 
to 
its 
ultimate 
scientific 
insufficiency; 
and 
also 
of 
the 
so-called 
anarchists' 
demand 
that 
the 
state 
be 
abolished 
overnight." 
(Herr 
Eugen 



Duhring's 
Revolution 
in 
Science,[5] 
pp.301-03, 
third 
German 
edition.) 


It 
is 
safe 
to 
say 
that 
of 
this 
argument 
of 
Engels', 
which 
is 
so 
remarkably 
rich 
in 
ideas, 
only 
one 
point 
has 
become 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
socialist 
thought 
among 
modern 
socialist 
parties, 
namely, 
that 
according 
to 
Marx 
that 
state 
“withers 
away” 
-as 
distinct 
from 
the 
anarchist 
doctrine 
of 
the 
“abolition” 
of 
the 
state. 
To 
prune 
Marxism 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
means 
reducing 
it 
to 
opportunism, 
for 
this 
“interpretation” 
only 
leaves 
a 
vague 
notion 
of 
a 
slow, 
even, 
gradual 
change, 
of 
absence 
of 
leaps 
and 
storms, 
of 
absence 
of 
revolution. 
The 
current, 
widespread, 
popular, 
if 
one 
may 
say 
so, 
conception 
of 
the 
“withering 
away" 
of 
the 
state 
undoubtedly 
means 
obscuring, 
if 
not 
repudiating, 
revolution. 


Such 
an 
“interpretation”, 
however, 
is 
the 
crudest 
distortion 
of 
Marxism, 
advantageous 
only 
to 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
In 
point 
of 
theory, 
it 
is 
based 
on 
disregard 
for 
the 
most 
important 
circumstances 
and 
considerations 
indicated 
in, 
say, 
Engels' 
“summary” 
argument 
we 
have 
just 
quoted 
in 
full. 


In 
the 
first 
place, 
at 
the 
very 
outset 
of 
his 
argument, 
Engels 
says 
that, 
in 
seizing 
state 
power, 
the 
proletariat 
thereby 
“abolishes 
the 
state 
as 
state". 
It 
is 
not 
done 
to 
ponder 
over 
over 
the 
meaning 
of 
this. 
Generally, 
it 
is 
either 
ignored 
altogether, 
or 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
something 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
“Hegelian 
weakness” 
on 
Engels' 
part. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
however, 
these 
words 
briefly 
express 
the 
experience 
of 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
proletarian 
revolutions, 
the 
Paris 
Commune 
of 
1871, 
of 
which 
we 
shall 
speak 
in 
greater 
detail 
in 
its 
proper 
place. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
Engels 
speaks 
here 
of 
the 
proletariat 
revolution 
“abolishing” 
the 
bourgeois 
state, 
while 
the 
words 
about 
the 
state 
withering 
away 
refer 
to 
the 
remnants 
of 
the 
proletarian 
state 
after 
the 
socialist 
revolution. 
According 
to 
Engels, 
the 
bourgeois 
state 
does 
not 
“wither 
away", 
but 
is 
“abolished” 
by 
the 
proletariat 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
revolution. 
What 
withers 
away 
after 
this 
revolution 
is 
the 
proletarian 
state 
or 
semi-state. 


Secondly, 
the 
state 
is 
a 
“special 
coercive 
force". 
Engels 
gives 
this 
splendid 
and 
extremely 
profound 
definition 
here 
with 
the 
utmost 
lucidity. 
And 
from 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
“special 
coercive 
force” 
for 
the 
suppression 
of 
the 
proletariat 
by 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
of 
millions 
of 
working 
people 
by 
handfuls 
of 
the 
rich, 
must 
be 
replaced 
by 
a 
“special 
coercive 
force” 
for 
the 
suppression 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie 
by 
the 
proletariat 
(the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat). 
This 
is 
precisely 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
“abolition 
of 
the 
state 
as 
state". 
This 
is 
precisely 
the 
“act” 
of 
taking 
possession 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
in 
the 
name 
of 



society. 
And 
it 
is 
self-evident 
that 
such 
a 
replacement 
of 
one 
(bourgeois) 
“special 
force” 
by 
another 
(proletarian) 
“special 
force” 
cannot 
possibly 
take 
place 
in 
the 
form 
of 
“withering 
away". 


Thirdly, 
in 
speaking 
of 
the 
state 
“withering 
away", 
and 
the 
even 
more 
graphic 
and 
colorful 
“dying 
down 
of 
itself", 
Engels 
refers 
quite 
clearly 
and 
definitely 
to 
the 
period 
after 
“the 
state 
has 
taken 
possession 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
in 
the 
name 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
society", 
that 
is, 
after 
the 
socialist 
revolution. 
We 
all 
know 
that 
the 
political 
form 
of 
the 
“state” 
at 
that 
time 
is 
the 
most 
complete 
democracy. 
But 
it 
never 
enters 
the 
head 
of 
any 
of 
the 
opportunists, 
who 
shamelessly 
distort 
Marxism, 
that 
Engels 
is 
consequently 
speaking 
here 
of 
democracy 
“dying 
down 
of 
itself", 
or 
“withering 
away". 
This 
seems 
very 
strange 
at 
first 
sight. 
But 
is 
is 
“incomprehensible” 
only 
to 
those 
who 
have 
not 
thought 
about 
democracy 
also 
being 
a 
state 
and, 
consequently, 
also 
disappearing 
when 
the 
state 
disappears. 
Revolution 
alone 
can 
“abolish” 
the 
bourgeois 
state. 
The 
state 
in 
general, 
i.e., 
the 
most 
complete 
democracy, 
can 
only 
“wither 
away". 


Fourthly, 
after 
formulating 
his 
famous 
proposition 
that 
“the 
state 
withers 
away", 
Engels 
at 
once 
explains 
specifically 
that 
this 
proposition 
is 
directed 
against 
both 
the 
opportunists 
and 
the 
anarchists. 
In 
doing 
this, 
Engels 
puts 
in 
the 
forefront 
that 
conclusion, 
drawn 
from 
the 
proposition 
that 
“the 
state 
withers 
away", 
which 
is 
directed 
against 
the 
opportunists. 


One 
can 
wager 
that 
out 
of 
every 
10,000 
persons 
who 
have 
read 
or 
heard 
about 
the 
“withering 
away” 
of 
the 
state, 
9,990 
are 
completely 
unaware, 
or 
do 
not 
remember, 
that 
Engels 
directed 
his 
conclusions 
from 
that 
proposition 
not 
against 
anarchists 
alone. 
And 
of 
the 
remaining 
10, 
probably 
nine 
do 
not 
know 
the 
meaning 
of 
a 
“free 
people's 
state” 
or 
why 
an 
attack 
on 
this 
slogan 
means 
an 
attack 
on 
opportunists. 
This 
is 
how 
history 
is 
written! 
This 
is 
how 
a 
great 
revolutionary 
teaching 
is 
imperceptibly 
falsified 
and 
adapted 
to 
prevailing 
philistinism. 
The 
conclusion 
directed 
against 
the 
anarchists 
has 
been 
repeated 
thousands 
of 
times; 
it 
has 
been 
vulgarized, 
and 
rammed 
into 
people's 
heads 
in 
the 
shallowest 
form, 
and 
has 
acquired 
the 
strength 
of 
a 
prejudice, 
whereas 
the 
conclusion 
directed 
against 
the 
opportunists 
has 
been 
obscured 
and 
“forgotten”! 


The 
“free 
people's 
state” 
was 
a 
programme 
demand 
and 
a 
catchword 
current 
among 
the 
German 
Social-Democrats 
in 
the 
seventies. 
this 
catchword 
is 
devoid 
of 
all 
political 
content 
except 
that 
it 
describes 
the 
concept 
of 
democracy 
in 
a 
pompous 
philistine 
fashion. 
Insofar 
as 
it 
hinted 
in 
a 
legally 



permissible 
manner 
at 
a 
democratic 
republic, 
Engels 
was 
prepared 
to 
“justify” 
its 
use 
“for 
a 
time” 
from 
an 
agitational 
point 
of 
view. 
But 
it 
was 
an 
opportunist 
catchword, 
for 
it 
amounted 
to 
something 
more 
than 
prettifying 
bourgeois 
democracy, 
and 
was 
also 
failure 
to 
understand 
the 
socialist 
criticism 
of 
the 
state 
in 
general. 
We 
are 
in 
favor 
of 
a 
democratic 
republic 
as 
the 
best 
form 
of 
state 
for 
the 
proletariat 
under 
capitalism. 
But 
we 
have 
no 
right 
to 
forget 
that 
wage 
slavery 
is 
the 
lot 
of 
the 
people 
even 
in 
the 
most 
democratic 
bourgeois 
republic. 
Furthermore, 
every 
state 
is 
a 
“special 
force” 
for 
the 
suppression 
of 
the 
oppressed 
class. 
Consequently, 
every 
state 
is 
not 
“free” 
and 
not 
a 
“people's 
state". 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
explained 
this 
repeatedly 
to 
their 
party 
comrades 
in 
the 
seventies. 


Fifthly, 
the 
same 
work 
of 
Engels', 
whose 
arguments 
about 
the 
withering 
away 
of 
the 
state 
everyone 
remembers, 
also 
contains 
an 
argument 
of 
the 
significance 
of 
violent 
revolution. 
Engels' 
historical 
analysis 
of 
its 
role 
becomes 
a 
veritable 
panegyric 
on 
violent 
revolution. 
This, 
“no 
one 
remembers". 
It 
is 
not 
done 
in 
modern 
socialist 
parties 
to 
talk 
or 
even 
think 
about 
the 
significance 
of 
this 
idea, 
and 
it 
plays 
no 
part 
whatever 
in 
their 
daily 
propaganda 
and 
agitation 
among 
the 
people. 
And 
yet 
it 
is 
inseparably 
bound 
up 
with 
the 
'withering 
away" 
of 
the 
state 
into 
one 
harmonious 
whole. 


Here 
is 
Engels' 
argument: 


“…That 
force, 
however, 
plays 
yet 
another 
role[6] 
in 
history, 
a 
revolutionary 
role; 
that, 
in 
the 
words 
of 
Marx, 
it 
is 
the 
midwife 
of 
every 
old 
society 
which 
is 
pregnant 
with 
a 
new 
one, 
that 
it 
is 
the 
instrument 
with 
which 
social 
movement 
forces 
its 
way 
through 
and 
shatters 
the 
dead, 
fossilized 
political 
forms 
-of 
this 
there 
is 
not 
a 
word 
in 
Herr 
Duhring. 
It 
is 
only 
with 
sighs 
and 
groans 
that 
he 
admits 
the 
possibility 
that 
force 
will 
perhaps 
be 
necessary 
for 
the 
overthrow 
of 
an 
economy 
based 
on 
exploitation 
unfortunately, 
because 
all 
use 
of 
force 
demoralizes, 
he 
says, 
the 
person 
who 
uses 
it. 
And 
this 
in 
Germany, 
where 
a 
violent 
collision 
-which 
may, 
after 
all, 
be 
forced 
on 
the 
people 
-would 
at 
least 
have 
the 
advantage 
of 
wiping 
out 
the 
servility 
which 
has 
penetrated 
the 
nation's 
mentality 
following 
the 
humiliation 
of 
the 
Thirty 
Years' 
War. 
And 
this 
person's 
mode 
of 
thought 
dull, 
insipid, 
and 
impotent 
-presumes 
to 
impose 
itself 
on 
the 
most 
revolutionary 
party 
that 
history 
has 
ever 
known! 
(p.193, 
third 
German 
edition, 
Part 
II, 
end 
of 
Chap.IV) 


How 
can 
this 
panegyric 
on 
violent 
revolution, 
which 
Engels 
insistently 
brought 
to 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
German 
Social-Democrats 
between 
1878 
and 



1894, 
i.e., 
right 
up 
to 
the 
time 
of 
his 
death, 
be 
combined 
with 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
'withering 
away" 
of 
the 
state 
to 
form 
a 
single 
theory? 


Usually 
the 
two 
are 
combined 
by 
means 
of 
eclecticism, 
by 
an 
unprincipled 
or 
sophistic 
selection 
made 
arbitrarily 
(or 
to 
please 
the 
powers 
that 
be) 
of 
first 
one, 
then 
another 
argument, 
and 
in 
99 
cases 
out 
of 
100, 
if 
not 
more, 
it 
is 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
“withering 
away” 
that 
is 
placed 
in 
the 
forefront. 
Dialectics 
are 
replaced 
by 
eclecticism 
-this 
is 
the 
most 
usual, 
the 
most 
widespread 
practice 
to 
be 
met 
with 
in 
present-day 
official 
Social-Democratic 
literature 
in 
relation 
to 
Marxism. 
This 
sort 
of 
substitution 
is, 
of 
course, 
nothing 
new; 
it 
was 
observed 
even 
in 
the 
history 
of 
classical 
Greek 
philosophy. 
In 
falsifying 
Marxism 
in 
opportunist 
fashion, 
the 
substitution 
of 
eclecticism 
for 
dialectics 
is 
the 
easiest 
way 
of 
deceiving 
the 
people. 
It 
gives 
an 
illusory 
satisfaction; 
it 
seems 
to 
take 
into 
account 
all 
sides 
of 
the 
process, 
all 
trends 
of 
development, 
all 
the 
conflicting 
influences, 
and 
so 
forth, 
whereas 
in 
reality 
it 
provides 
no 
integral 
and 
revolutionary 
conception 
of 
the 
process 
of 
social 
development 
at 
all. 


We 
have 
already 
said 
above, 
and 
shall 
show 
more 
fully 
later, 
that 
the 
theory 
of 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
of 
the 
inevitability 
of 
a 
violent 
revolution 
refers 
to 
the 
bourgeois 
state. 
The 
latter 
cannot 
be 
superseded 
by 
the 
proletarian 
state 
(the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat) 
through 
the 
process 
of 
'withering 
away", 
but, 
as 
a 
general 
rule, 
only 
through 
a 
violent 
revolution. 
The 
panegyric 
Engels 
sang 
in 
its 
honor, 
and 
which 
fully 
corresponds 
to 
Marx's 
repeated 
statements 
(see 
the 
concluding 
passages 
of 
The 
Poverty 
of 
Philosophy 
and 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto, 
with 
their 
proud 
and 
open 
proclamation 
of 
the 
inevitability 
of 
a 
violent 
revolution; 
see 
what 
Marx 
wrote 
nearly 
30 
years 
later, 
in 
criticizing 
the 
Gotha 
Programme 
of 
1875, 
when 
he 
mercilessly 
castigated 
the 
opportunist 
character 
of 
that 
programme) 
-this 
panegyric 
is 
by 
no 
means 
a 
mere 
“impulse”, 
a 
mere 
declamation 
or 
a 
polemical 
sally. 
The 
necessity 
of 
systematically 
imbuing 
the 
masses 
with 
this 
and 
precisely 
this 
view 
of 
violent 
revolution 
lies 
at 
the 
root 
of 
the 
entire 
theory 
of 
Marx 
and 
Engels. 
The 
betrayal 
of 
their 
theory 
by 
the 
now 
prevailing 
social-chauvinist 
and 
Kautskyite 
trends 
expresses 
itself 
strikingly 
in 
both 
these 
trends 
ignoring 
such 
propaganda 
and 
agitation. 


The 
supersession 
of 
the 
bourgeois 
state 
by 
the 
proletarian 
state 
is 
impossible 
without 
a 
violent 
revolution. 
The 
abolition 
of 
the 
proletarian 
state, 
i.e., 
of 
the 
state 
in 
general, 
is 
impossible 
except 
through 
the 
process 
of 
“withering 
away". 



A 
detailed 
and 
concrete 
elaboration 
of 
these 
views 
was 
given 
by 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
when 
they 
studied 
each 
particular 
revolutionary 
situation, 
when 
they 
analyzed 
the 
lessons 
of 
the 
experience 
of 
each 
particular 
revolution. 
We 
shall 
now 
pass 
to 
this, 
undoubtedly 
the 
most 
important, 
part 
of 
their 
theory. 



Chapter 
II: 
The 
Experience 
of 
1848-51 



1. 
The 
Eve 
of 
Revolution 
The 
first 
works 
of 
mature 
Marxism 
-The 
Poverty 
of 
Philosophy 
and 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto 
-appeared 
just 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
the 
revolution 
of 
1848. 
For 
this 
reason, 
in 
addition 
to 
presenting 
the 
general 
principles 
of 
Marxism, 
they 
reflect 
to 
a 
certain 
degree 
the 
concrete 
revolutionary 
situation 
of 
the 
time. 
It 
will, 
therefore, 
be 
more 
expedient, 
perhaps, 
to 
examine 
what 
the 
authors 
of 
these 
works 
said 
about 
the 
state 
immediately 
before 
they 
drew 
conclusions 
from 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
years 
1848-51. 


In 
The 
Poverty 
of 
Philosophy, 
Marx 
wrote: 


"The 
working 
class, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
development, 
will 
substitute 
for 
the 
old 
bourgeois 
society 
an 
association 
which 
will 
preclude 
classes 
and 
their 
antagonism, 
and 
there 
will 
be 
no 
more 
political 
power 
groups, 
since 
the 
political 
power 
is 
precisely 
the 
official 
expression 
of 
class 
antagonism 
in 
bourgeois 
society." 
(p.182, 
German 
edition, 
1885) 


It 
is 
instructive 
to 
compare 
this 
general 
exposition 
of 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
state 
disappearing 
after 
the 
abolition 
of 
classes 
with 
the 
exposition 
contained 
in 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto, 
written 
by 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
a 
few 
months 
later-in 
November 
1847, 
to 
be 
exact: 


"… 
In 
depicting 
the 
most 
general 
phases 
of 
the 
development 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
we 
traced 
the 
more 
or 
less 
veiled 
civil 
war, 
raging 
within 
existing 
society 
up 
to 
the 
point 
where 
that 
war 
breaks 
out 
into 
open 
revolution, 
and 
where 
the 
violent 
overthrow 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie 
lays 
the 
foundation 
for 
the 
sway 
of 
the 
proletariat… 


"… 
We 
have 
seen 
above 
that 
the 
first 
step 
in 
the 
revolution 
by 
the 
working 
class 
is 
to 
raise 
the 
proletariat 
to 
the 
position 
of 
the 
ruling 
class 
to 
win 
the 
battle 
of 
democracy. 


"The 
proletariat 
will 
use 
its 
political 
supremacy 
to 
wrest, 
by 
degree, 
all 
capital 
from 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
to 
centralize 
all 
instruments 
of 
production 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
state, 
i.e., 
of 
the 
proletariat 
organized 
as 
the 
ruling 
class; 
and 
to 
increase 
the 
total 
productive 
forces 
as 
rapidly 
as 
possible." 
(pp.31 
and 
37, 
seventh 
German 
edition, 
1906) 


Here 
we 
have 
a 
formulation 
of 
one 
of 
the 
most 
remarkable 
and 
most 
important 
ideas 
of 
Marxism 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
state, 
namely, 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
"dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat" 
(as 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
began 
to 
call 
it 
after 
the 
Paris 
Commune); 
and, 
also, 
a 
highly 
interesting 
definition 
of 
the 
state, 



which 
is 
also 
one 
of 
the 
"forgotten 
words" 
of 
Marxism: 
"the 
state, 
i.e., 
the 
proletariat 
organized 
as 
the 
ruling 
class." 


This 
definition 
of 
the 
state 
has 
never 
been 
explained 
in 
the 
prevailing 
propaganda 
and 
agitation 
literature 
of 
the 
official 
Social-Democratic 
parties. 
More 
than 
that, 
it 
has 
been 
deliberately 
ignored, 
for 
it 
is 
absolutely 
irreconcilable 
with 
reformism, 
and 
is 
a 
slap 
in 
the 
face 
for 
the 
common 
opportunist 
prejudices 
and 
philistine 
illusions 
about 
the 
"peaceful 
development 
of 
democracy". 


The 
proletariat 
needs 
the 
state 
-this 
is 
repeated 
by 
all 
the 
opportunists, 
social-chauvinists 
and 
Kautskyites, 
who 
assure 
us 
that 
this 
is 
what 
Marx 
taught. 
But 
they 
“forget” 
to 
add 
that, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
according 
to 
Marx, 
the 
proletariat 
needs 
only 
a 
state 
which 
is 
withering 
away, 
i.e., 
a 
state 
so 
constituted 
that 
it 
begins 
to 
wither 
away 
immediately, 
and 
cannot 
but 
wither 
away. 
And, 
secondly, 
the 
working 
people 
need 
a 
"state, 
i.e., 
the 
proletariat 
organized 
as 
the 
ruling 
class". 


The 
state 
is 
a 
special 
organization 
of 
force: 
it 
is 
an 
organization 
of 
violence 
for 
the 
suppression 
of 
some 
class. 
What 
class 
must 
the 
proletariat 
suppress? 
Naturally, 
only 
the 
exploiting 
class, 
i.e., 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
The 
working 
people 
need 
the 
state 
only 
to 
suppress 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
exploiters, 
and 
only 
the 
proletariat 
can 
direct 
this 
suppression, 
can 
carry 
it 
out. 
For 
the 
proletariat 
is 
the 
only 
class 
that 
is 
consistently 
revolutionary, 
the 
only 
class 
that 
can 
unite 
all 
the 
working 
and 
exploited 
people 
in 
the 
struggle 
against 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
in 
completely 
removing 
it. 


The 
exploiting 
classes 
need 
political 
rule 
to 
maintain 
exploitation, 
i.e., 
in 
the 
selfish 
interests 
of 
an 
insignificant 
minority 
against 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
all 
people. 
The 
exploited 
classes 
need 
political 
rule 
in 
order 
to 
completely 
abolish 
all 
exploitation, 
i.e., 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
the 
people, 
and 
against 
the 
insignificant 
minority 
consisting 
of 
the 
modern 
slave-owners 
-the 
landowners 
and 
capitalists. 


The 
petty-bourgeois 
democrats, 
those 
sham 
socialists 
who 
replaced 
the 
class 
struggle 
by 
dreams 
of 
class 
harmony, 
even 
pictured 
the 
socialist 
transformation 
in 
a 
dreamy 
fashion 
-not 
as 
the 
overthrow 
of 
the 
rule 
of 
the 
exploiting 
class, 
but 
as 
the 
peaceful 
submission 
of 
the 
minority 
to 
the 
majority 
which 
has 
become 
aware 
of 
its 
aims. 
This 
petty-bourgeois 
utopia, 
which 
is 
inseparable 
from 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
state 
being 
above 
classes, 
led 
in 
practice 
to 
the 
betrayal 
of 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
working 
classes, 
as 
was 
shown, 
for 
example, 
by 
the 
history 
of 
the 
French 
revolutions 
of 
1848 
and 
1871, 
and 



by 
the 
experience 
of 
“socialist” 
participation 
in 
bourgeois 
Cabinets 
in 
Britain, 
France, 
Italy 
and 
other 
countries 
at 
the 
turn 
of 
the 
century. 


All 
his 
life 
Marx 
fought 
against 
this 
petty-bourgeois 
socialism, 
now 
revived 
in 
Russia 
by 
the 
Socialist-Revolutionary 
and 
Menshevik 
parties. 
He 
developed 
his 
theory 
of 
the 
class 
struggle 
consistently, 
down 
to 
the 
theory 
of 
political 
power, 
of 
the 
state. 


The 
overthrow 
of 
bourgeois 
rule 
can 
be 
accomplished 
only 
by 
the 
proletariat, 
the 
particular 
class 
whose 
economic 
conditions 
of 
existence 
prepare 
it 
for 
this 
task 
and 
provide 
it 
with 
the 
possibility 
and 
the 
power 
to 
perform 
it. 
While 
the 
bourgeoisie 
break 
up 
and 
disintegrate 
the 
peasantry 
and 
all 
the 
petty-bourgeois 
groups, 
they 
weld 
together, 
unite 
and 
organize 
the 
proletariat. 
Only 
the 
proletariat 
-by 
virtue 
of 
the 
economic 
role 
it 
plays 
in 
large-scale 
production 
-is 
capable 
of 
being 
the 
leader 
of 
all 
the 
working 
and 
exploited 
people, 
whom 
the 
bourgeoisie 
exploit, 
oppress 
and 
crush, 
often 
not 
less 
but 
more 
than 
they 
do 
the 
proletarians, 
but 
who 
are 
incapable 
of 
waging 
an 
independent 
struggle 
for 
their 
emancipation. 


The 
theory 
of 
class 
struggle, 
applied 
by 
Marx 
to 
the 
question 
of 
the 
state 
and 
the 
socialist 
revolution, 
leads 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
course 
to 
the 
recognition 
of 
the 
political 
rule 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
of 
its 
dictatorship, 
i.e., 
of 
undivided 
power 
directly 
backed 
by 
the 
armed 
force 
of 
the 
people. 
The 
overthrow 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie 
can 
be 
achieved 
only 
by 
the 
proletariat 
becoming 
the 
ruling 
class, 
capable 
of 
crushing 
the 
inevitable 
and 
desperate 
resistance 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
and 
of 
organizing 
all 
the 
working 
and 
exploited 
people 
for 
the 
new 
economic 
system. 


The 
proletariat 
needs 
state 
power, 
a 
centralized 
organization 
of 
force, 
an 
organization 
of 
violence, 
both 
to 
crush 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
exploiters 
and 
to 
lead 
the 
enormous 
mass 
of 
the 
population 
-the 
peasants, 
the 
petty 
bourgeoisie, 
and 
semi-proletarians 
-in 
the 
work 
of 
organizing 
a 
socialist 
economy. 


By 
educating 
the 
workers' 
party, 
Marxism 
educates 
the 
vanguard 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
capable 
of 
assuming 
power 
and 
leading 
the 
whole 
people 
to 
socialism, 
of 
directing 
and 
organizing 
the 
new 
system, 
of 
being 
the 
teacher, 
the 
guide, 
the 
leader 
of 
all 
the 
working 
and 
exploited 
people 
in 
organizing 
their 
social 
life 
without 
the 
bourgeoisie 
and 
against 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
By 
contrast, 
the 
opportunism 
now 
prevailing 
trains 
the 
members 
of 
the 
workers' 
party 
to 
be 
the 
representatives 
of 
the 
better-paid 
workers, 
who 
lose 
touch 
with 
the 
masses, 
"get 
along" 
fairly 
well 
under 
capitalism, 
and 
sell 
their 
birthright 



for 
a 
mass 
of 
pottage, 
i.e., 
renounce 
their 
role 
as 
revolutionary 
leaders 
of 
the 
people 
against 
the 
bourgeoisie. 


Marx's 
theory 
of 
"the 
state, 
i.e., 
the 
proletariat 
organized 
as 
the 
ruling 
class", 
is 
inseparably 
bound 
up 
with 
the 
whole 
of 
his 
doctrine 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
role 
of 
the 
proletariat 
in 
history. 
The 
culmination 
of 
this 
rule 
is 
the 
proletarian 
dictatorship, 
the 
political 
rule 
of 
the 
proletariat. 


But 
since 
the 
proletariat 
needs 
the 
state 
as 
a 
special 
form 
of 
organization 
of 
violence 
against 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
the 
following 
conclusion 
suggests 
itself: 
is 
it 
conceivable 
that 
such 
an 
organization 
can 
be 
created 
without 
first 
abolishing, 
destroying 
the 
state 
machine 
created 
by 
the 
bourgeoisie 
for 
themselves? 
The 
Communist 
Manifesto 
leads 
straight 
to 
this 
conclusion, 
and 
it 
is 
of 
this 
conclusion 
that 
Marx 
speaks 
when 
summing 
up 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
revolution 
of 
1848-51. 



2. 
The 
Revolution 
Summed 
Up 
Marx 
sums 
up 
his 
conclusions 
from 
the 
revolution 
of 
1848-51, 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
state 
we 
are 
concerned 
with, 
in 
the 
following 
argument 
contained 
in 
The 
Eighteenth 
Brumaire 
of 
Louis 
Bonaparte: 


"But 
the 
revolution 
is 
throughgoing. 
It 
is 
still 
journeying 
through 
purgatory. 
It 
does 
its 
work 
methodically. 
By 
December 
2, 
1851,[7] 
it 
had 
completed 
one 
half 
of 
its 
preparatory 
work. 
It 
is 
now 
completing 
the 
other 
half. 
First 
it 
perfected 
the 
parliamentary 
power, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
overthrow 
it. 
Now 
that 
it 
has 
attained 
this, 
it 
is 
perfecting 
the 
executive 
power, 
reducing 
it 
to 
its 
purest 
expression, 
isolating 
it, 
setting 
it 
up 
against 
itself 
as 
the 
sole 
object, 
in 
order 
to 
concentrate 
all 
its 
forces 
of 
destruction 
against 
it. 
And 
when 
it 
has 
done 
this 
second 
half 
of 
its 
preliminary 
work, 
Europe 
will 
leap 
from 
its 
seat 
and 
exultantly 
exclaim: 
well 
grubbed, 
old 
mole! 


"This 
executive 
power 
with 
its 
enormous 
bureaucratic 
and 
military 
organization, 
with 
its 
vast 
and 
ingenious 
state 
machinery, 
with 
a 
host 
of 
officials 
numbering 
half 
a 
million, 
besides 
an 
army 
of 
another 
half 
million, 
this 
appalling 
parasitic 
body, 
which 
enmeshes 
the 
body 
of 
French 
society 
and 
chokes 
all 
its 
pores, 
sprang 
up 
in 
the 
days 
of 
the 
absolute 
monarchy, 
with 
the 
decay 
of 
the 
feudal 
system, 
which 
it 
helped 
to 
hasten." 
The 
first 
French 
Revolution 
developed 
centralization, 
"but 
at 
the 
same 
time" 
it 
increased 
"the 
extent, 
the 
attributes 
and 
the 
number 
of 
agents 
of 
governmental 
power. 
Napoleon 
completed 
this 
state 
machinery". 
The 
legitimate 
monarchy 
and 
the 
July 
monarchy 
"added 
nothing 
but 
a 
greater 
division 
of 
labor"… 


"… 
Finally, 
in 
its 
struggle 
against 
the 
revolution, 
the 
parliamentary 
republic 
found 
itself 
compelled 
to 
strengthen, 
along 
with 
repressive 
measures, 
the 
resources 
and 
centralization 
of 
governmental 
power. 
All 
revolutions 
perfected 
this 
machine 
instead 
of 
smashing 
it. 
The 
parties 
that 
contended 
in 
turn 
for 
domination 
regarded 
the 
possession 
of 
this 
huge 
state 
edifice 
as 
the 
principal 
spoils 
of 
the 
victor." 
(The 
Eighteenth 
Brumaire 
of 
Louis 
Bonaparte 
pp.98-99, 
fourth 
edition, 
Hamburg, 
1907) 


In 
this 
remarkable 
argument, 
Marxism 
takes 
a 
tremendous 
step 
forward 
compared 
with 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto. 
In 
the 
latter, 
the 
question 
of 
the 
state 
is 
still 
treated 
in 
an 
extremely 
abstract 
manner, 
in 
the 
most 
general 
terms 
and 
expressions. 
In 
the 
above-quoted 
passage, 
the 
question 
is 
treated 
in 
a 



concrete 
manner, 
and 
the 
conclusion 
is 
extremely 
precise, 
definite, 
practical 
and 
palpable: 
all 
previous 
revolutions 
perfected 
the 
state 
machine, 
whereas 
it 
must 
be 
broken, 
smashed. 


This 
conclusion 
is 
the 
chief 
and 
fundamental 
point 
in 
the 
Marxist 
theory 
of 
the 
state. 
And 
it 
is 
precisely 
this 
fundamental 
point 
which 
has 
been 
completely 
ignored 
by 
the 
dominant 
official 
Social-Democratic 
parties 
and, 
indeed, 
distorted 
(as 
we 
shall 
see 
later) 
by 
the 
foremost 
theoretician 
of 
the 
Second 
International, 
Karl 
Kautsky. 


The 
Communist 
Manifesto 
gives 
a 
general 
summary 
of 
history, 
which 
compels 
us 
to 
regard 
the 
state 
as 
the 
organ 
of 
class 
rule 
and 
leads 
us 
to 
the 
inevitable 
conclusion 
that 
the 
proletariat 
cannot 
overthrow 
the 
bourgeoisie 
without 
first 
winning 
political 
power, 
without 
attaining 
political 
supremacy, 
without 
transforming 
the 
state 
into 
the 
"proletariat 
organized 
as 
the 
ruling 
class"; 
and 
that 
this 
proletarian 
state 
will 
begin 
to 
wither 
away 
immediately 
after 
its 
victory 
because 
the 
state 
is 
unnecessary 
and 
cannot 
exist 
in 
a 
society 
in 
which 
there 
are 
no 
class 
antagonisms. 
The 
question 
as 
to 
how, 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
historical 
development, 
the 
replacement 
of 
the 
bourgeois 
by 
the 
proletarian 
state 
is 
to 
take 
place 
is 
not 
raised 
here. 


This 
is 
the 
question 
Marx 
raises 
and 
answers 
in 
1852. 
True 
to 
his 
philosophy 
of 
dialectical 
materialism, 
Marx 
takes 
as 
his 
basis 
the 
historical 
experience 
of 
the 
great 
years 
of 
revolution, 
1848 
to 
1851. 
Here, 
as 
everywhere 
else, 
his 
theory 
is 
a 
summing 
up 
of 
experience, 
illuminated 
by 
a 
profound 
philosophical 
conception 
of 
the 
world 
and 
a 
rich 
knowledge 
of 
history. 


The 
problem 
of 
the 
state 
is 
put 
specifically: 
How 
did 
the 
bourgeois 
state, 
the 
state 
machine 
necessary 
for 
the 
rule 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
come 
into 
being 
historically? 
What 
changes 
did 
it 
undergo, 
what 
evolution 
did 
it 
perform 
in 
the 
course 
of 
bourgeois 
revolutions 
and 
in 
the 
face 
of 
the 
independent 
actions 
of 
the 
oppressed 
classes? 
What 
are 
the 
tasks 
of 
the 
proletariat 
in 
relation 
to 
this 
state 
machine? 


The 
centralized 
state 
power 
that 
is 
peculiar 
to 
bourgeois 
society 
came 
into 
being 
in 
the 
period 
of 
the 
fall 
of 
absolutism. 
Two 
institutions 
most 
characteristic 
of 
this 
state 
machine 
are 
the 
bureaucracy 
and 
the 
standing 
army. 
In 
their 
works, 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
repeatedly 
show 
that 
the 
bourgeoisie 
are 
connected 
with 
these 
institutions 
by 
thousands 
of 
threads. 
Every 
worker's 
experience 
illustrates 
this 
connection 
in 
an 
extremely 
graphic 
and 
impressive 
manner. 
From 
its 
own 
bitter 
experience, 
the 
working 
class 
learns 
to 
recognize 



this 
connection. 
That 
is 
why 
it 
so 
easily 
grasps 
and 
so 
firmly 
learns 
the 
doctrine 
which 
shows 
the 
inevitability 
of 
this 
connection, 
a 
doctrine 
which 
the 
petty-bourgeois 
democrats 
either 
ignorantly 
and 
flippantly 
deny, 
or 
still 
more 
flippantly 
admit 
"in 
general", 
while 
forgetting 
to 
draw 
appropriate 
practical 
conclusions. 


The 
bureaucracy 
and 
the 
standing 
army 
are 
a 
“parasite” 
on 
the 
body 
of 
bourgeois 
society-a 
parasite 
created 
by 
the 
internal 
antagonisms 
which 
rend 
that 
society, 
but 
a 
parasite 
which 
“chokes” 
all 
its 
vital 
pores. 
The 
Kautskyite 
opportunism 
now 
prevailing 
in 
official 
Social-Democracy 
considers 
the 
view 
that 
the 
state 
is 
a 
parasitic 
organism 
to 
be 
the 
peculiar 
and 
exclusive 
attribute 
of 
anarchism. 
It 
goes 
without 
saying 
that 
this 
distortion 
of 
Marxism 
is 
of 
vast 
advantage 
to 
those 
philistines 
who 
have 
reduced 
socialism 
to 
the 
unheard-of 
disgrace 
of 
justifying 
and 
prettifying 
the 
imperialist 
war 
by 
applying 
to 
it 
the 
concept 
of 
"defence 
of 
the 
fatherland"; 
but 
it 
is 
unquestionably 
a 
distortion, 
nevertheless. 


The 
development, 
perfection, 
and 
strengthening 
of 
the 
bureaucratic 
and 
military 
apparatus 
proceeded 
during 
all 
the 
numerous 
bourgeois 
revolutions 
which 
Europe 
has 
witnessed 
since 
the 
fall 
of 
feudalism. 
In 
particular, 
it 
is 
the 
petty 
bourgeois 
who 
are 
attracted 
to 
the 
side 
of 
the 
big 
bourgeoisie 
and 
are 
largely 
subordinated 
to 
them 
through 
this 
apparatus, 
which 
provides 
the 
upper 
sections 
of 
the 
peasants, 
small 
artisans, 
tradesmen, 
and 
the 
like 
with 
comparatively 
comfortable, 
quiet, 
and 
respectable 
jobs 
raising 
the 
holders 
above 
the 
people. 
Consider 
what 
happened 
in 
Russia 
during 
the 
six 
months 
following 
February 
27, 
1917. 
The 
official 
posts 
which 
formerly 
were 
given 
by 
preference 
to 
the 
Black 
Hundreds 
have 
now 
become 
the 
spoils 
of 
the 
Cadets, 
Mensheviks, 
and 
Social-Revolutionaries. 
Nobody 
has 
really 
thought 
of 
introducing 
any 
serious 
reforms. 
Every 
effort 
has 
been 
made 
to 
put 
them 
off 
"until 
the 
Constituent 
Assembly 
meets", 
and 
to 
steadily 
put 
off 
its 
convocation 
until 
after 
the 
war! 
But 
there 
has 
been 
no 
delay, 
no 
waiting 
for 
the 
Constituent 
Assembly, 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
dividing 
the 
spoils 
of 
getting 
the 
lucrative 
jobs 
of 
ministers, 
deputy 
ministers, 
governors-general, 
etc., 
etc.! 
The 
game 
of 
combinations 
that 
has 
been 
played 
in 
forming 
the 
government 
has 
been, 
in 
essence, 
only 
an 
expression 
of 
this 
division 
and 
redivision 
of 
the 
“spoils”, 
which 
has 
been 
going 
on 
above 
and 
below, 
throughout 
the 
country, 
in 
every 
department 
of 
central 
and 
local 
government. 
The 
six 
months 
between 
February 
27 
and 
August 
27, 
1917, 
can 
be 
summed 
up, 
objectively 
summed 
up 
beyond 
all 
dispute, 
as 
follows: 
reforms 
shelved, 
distribution 
of 



official 
jobs 
accomplished 
and 
“mistakes” 
in 
the 
distribution 
corrected 
by 
a 
few 
redistributions. 


But 
the 
more 
the 
bureaucratic 
apparatus 
is 
“redistributed” 
among 
the 
various 
bourgeois 
and 
petty-bourgeois 
parties 
(among 
the 
Cadets, 
Socialist-
Revolutionaries 
and 
Mensheviks 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Russia), 
the 
more 
keenly 
aware 
the 
oppressed 
classes, 
and 
the 
proletariat 
at 
their 
head, 
become 
of 
their 
irreconcilable 
hostility 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
bourgeois 
society. 
Hence 
the 
need 
for 
all 
bourgeois 
parties, 
even 
for 
the 
most 
democratic 
and 
"revolutionarydemocratic" 
among 
them, 
to 
intensify 
repressive 
measures 
against 
the 
revolutionary 
proletariat, 
to 
strengthen 
the 
apparatus 
of 
coercion, 
i.e., 
the 
state 
machine. 
This 
course 
of 
events 
compels 
the 
revolution 
"to 
concentrate 
all 
its 
forces 
of 
destruction" 
against 
the 
state 
power, 
and 
to 
set 
itself 
the 
aim, 
not 
of 
improving 
the 
state 
machine, 
but 
of 
smashing 
and 
destroying 
it. 


It 
was 
not 
logical 
reasoning, 
but 
actual 
developments, 
the 
actual 
experience 
of 
1848-51, 
that 
led 
to 
the 
matter 
being 
presented 
in 
this 
way. 
The 
extent 
to 
which 
Marx 
held 
strictly 
to 
the 
solid 
ground 
of 
historical 
experience 
can 
be 
seen 
from 
the 
fact 
that, 
in 
1852, 
he 
did 
not 
yet 
specifically 
raise 
the 
question 
of 
what 
was 
to 
take 
the 
place 
of 
the 
state 
machine 
to 
be 
destroyed. 
Experience 
had 
not 
yet 
provided 
material 
for 
dealing 
with 
this 
question, 
which 
history 
placed 
on 
the 
agenda 
later 
on, 
in 
1871. 
In 
1852, 
all 
that 
could 
be 
established 
with 
the 
accuracy 
of 
scientific 
observation 
was 
that 
the 
proletarian 
revolution 
had 
approached 
the 
task 
of 
"concentrating 
all 
its 
forces 
of 
destruction" 
against 
the 
state 
power, 
of 
“smashing” 
the 
state 
machine. 


Here 
the 
question 
may 
arise: 
is 
it 
correct 
to 
generalize 
the 
experience, 
observations 
and 
conclusions 
of 
Marx, 
to 
apply 
them 
to 
a 
field 
that 
is 
wider 
than 
the 
history 
of 
France 
during 
the 
three 
years 
1848-51? 
Before 
proceeding 
to 
deal 
with 
this 
question, 
let 
us 
recall 
a 
remark 
made 
by 
Engels 
and 
then 
examine 
the 
facts. 
In 
his 
introduction 
to 
the 
third 
edition 
of 
The 
Eighteenth 
Brumaire, 
Engels 
wrote: 


"France 
is 
the 
country 
where, 
more 
than 
anywhere 
else, 
the 
historical 
class 
struggles 
were 
each 
time 
fought 
out 
to 
a 
finish, 
and 
where, 
consequently, 
the 
changing 
political 
forms 
within 
which 
they 
move 
and 
in 
which 
their 
results 
are 
summarized 
have 
been 
stamped 
in 
the 
sharpest 
outlines. 
The 
centre 
of 
feudalism 
in 
the 
Middle 
Ages, 
the 
model 
country, 
since 
the 
Renaissance, 
of 
a 
unified 
monarchy 
based 
on 
social 
estates, 
France 
demolished 
feudalism 
in 
the 
Great 
Revolution 
and 
established 
the 
rule 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie 
in 
a 
classical 
purity 
unequalled 
by 
any 
other 
European 
land. 
And 



the 
struggle 
of 
the 
upward-striving 
proletariat 
against 
the 
ruling 
bourgeoisie 
appeared 
here 
in 
an 
acute 
form 
unknown 
elsewhere." 
(p.4, 
1907 
edition) 


The 
last 
remark 
is 
out 
of 
date 
insomuch 
as 
since 
1871 
there 
has 
been 
a 
lull 
in 
the 
revolutionary 
struggle 
of 
the 
French 
proletariat, 
although, 
long 
as 
this 
lull 
may 
be, 
it 
does 
not 
at 
all 
preclude 
the 
possibility 
that 
in 
the 
coming 
proletarian 
revolution 
France 
may 
show 
herself 
to 
be 
the 
classic 
country 
of 
the 
class 
struggle 
to 
a 
finish. 


Let 
us, 
however, 
cast 
a 
general 
glance 
over 
the 
history 
of 
the 
advanced 
countries 
at 
the 
turn 
of 
the 
century. 
We 
shall 
see 
that 
the 
same 
process 
went 
on 
more 
slowly, 
in 
more 
varied 
forms, 
in 
a 
much 
wider 
field: 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
the 
development 
of 
"parliamentary 
power" 
both 
in 
the 
republican 
countries 
(France, 
America, 
Switzerland), 
and 
in 
the 
monarchies 
(Britain, 
Germany 
to 
a 
certain 
extent, 
Italy, 
the 
Scandinavia 
countries, 
etc.); 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
a 
struggle 
for 
power 
among 
the 
various 
bourgeois 
and 
petty-
bourgeois 
parties 
which 
distributed 
and 
redistributed 
the 
“spoils” 
of 
office, 
with 
the 
foundations 
of 
bourgeois 
society 
unchanged; 
and, 
lastly, 
the 
perfection 
and 
consolidation 
of 
the 
"executive 
power", 
of 
its 
bureaucratic 
and 
military 
apparatus. 


There 
is 
not 
the 
slightest 
doubt 
that 
these 
features 
are 
common 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
modern 
evolution 
of 
all 
capitalist 
states 
in 
general. 
In 
the 
last 
three 
years 
1848-51 
France 
displayed, 
in 
a 
swift, 
sharp, 
concentrated 
form, 
the 
very 
same 
processes 
of 
development 
which 
are 
peculiar 
to 
the 
whole 
capitalist 
world. 


Imperialism-the 
era 
of 
bank 
capital, 
the 
era 
of 
gigantic 
capitalist 
monopolies, 
of 
the 
development 
of 
monopoly 
capitalism 
into 
state-monopoly 
capitalism-has 
clearly 
shown 
an 
unprecedented 
growth 
in 
its 
bureaucratic 
and 
military 
apparatus 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
intensification 
of 
repressive 
measures 
against 
the 
proletariat 
both 
in 
the 
monarchical 
and 
in 
the 
freest, 
republican 
countries. 


World 
history 
is 
now 
undoubtedly 
leading, 
on 
an 
incomparably 
larger 
scale 
than 
in 
1852, 
to 
the 
"concentration 
of 
all 
the 
forces" 
of 
the 
proletarian 
revolution 
on 
the 
“destruction” 
of 
the 
state 
machine. 


What 
the 
proletariat 
will 
put 
in 
its 
place 
is 
suggested 
by 
the 
highly 
instructive 
material 
furnished 
by 
the 
Paris 
Commune. 



3. 
The 
Presentation 
of 
the 
Question 
by 
Marx 
in 
1852 
In 
1907, 
Mehring, 
in 
the 
magazine 
Neue 
Zeit 
(Vol.XXV, 
2, 
p.164), 
published 
extracts 
from 
Marx's 
letter 
to 
Weydemeyer 
dated 
March 
5, 
1852. 
This 
letter, 
among 
other 
things, 
contains 
the 
following 
remarkable 
observation: 


"And 
now 
as 
to 
myself, 
no 
credit 
is 
due 
to 
me 
for 
discovering 
the 
existence 
of 
classes 
in 
modern 
society 
or 
the 
struggle 
between 
them. 
Long 
before 
me 
bourgeois 
historians 
had 
described 
the 
historical 
development 
of 
this 
class 
struggle 
and 
bourgeois 
economists, 
the 
economic 
anatomy 
of 
classes. 
What 
I 
did 
that 
was 
new 
was 
to 
prove: 
(1) 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
classes 
is 
only 
bound 
up 
with 
the 
particular, 
historical 
phases 
in 
the 
development 
of 
production 
(historische 
Entwicklungsphasen 
der 
Produktion), 


(2) 
that 
the 
class 
struggle 
necessarily 
leads 
to 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
(3) 
that 
this 
dictatorship 
itself 
only 
constitutes 
the 
transition 
to 
the 
abolition 
of 
all 
classes 
and 
to 
a 
classless 
society." 
In 
these 
words, 
Marx 
succeeded 
in 
expressing 
with 
striking 
clarity, 
first, 
the 
chief 
and 
radical 
difference 
between 
his 
theory 
and 
that 
of 
the 
foremost 
and 
most 
profound 
thinkers 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie; 
and, 
secondly, 
the 
essence 
of 
his 
theory 
of 
the 
state. 


It 
is 
often 
said 
and 
written 
that 
the 
main 
point 
in 
Marx's 
theory 
is 
the 
class 
struggle. 
But 
this 
is 
wrong. 
And 
this 
wrong 
notion 
very 
often 
results 
in 
an 
opportunist 
distortion 
of 
Marxism 
and 
its 
falsification 
in 
a 
spirit 
acceptable 
to 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
For 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
class 
struggle 
was 
created 
not 
by 
Marx, 
but 
by 
the 
bourgeoisie 
before 
Marx, 
and, 
generally 
speaking, 
it 
is 
acceptable 
to 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
Those 
who 
recognize 
only 
the 
class 
struggle 
are 
not 
yet 
Marxists; 
they 
may 
be 
found 
to 
be 
still 
within 
the 
bounds 
of 
bourgeois 
thinking 
and 
bourgeois 
politics. 
To 
confine 
Marxism 
to 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
class 
struggle 
means 
curtailing 
Marxism, 
distorting 
it, 
reducing 
it 
to 
something 
acceptable 
to 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
Only 
he 
is 
a 
Marxist 
who 
extends 
the 
recognition 
of 
the 
class 
struggle 
to 
the 
recognition 
of 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat. 
That 
is 
what 
constitutes 
the 
most 
profound 
distinction 
between 
the 
Marxist 
and 
the 
ordinary 
petty 
(as 
well 
as 
big) 
bourgeois. 
This 
is 
the 
touchstone 
on 
which 
the 
real 
understanding 
and 
recognition 
of 
Marxism 
should 
be 
tested. 
And 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
when 
the 
history 
of 
Europe 
brought 
the 
working 
class 
face 
to 
face 
with 
this 
question 
as 
a 
practical 
issue, 



not 
only 
all 
the 
opportunists 
and 
reformists, 
but 
all 
the 
Kautskyites 
(people 
who 
vacillate 
between 
reformism 
and 
Marxism) 
proved 
to 
be 
miserable 
philistines 
and 
petty-bourgeois 
democrats 
repudiating 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat. 
Kautsky's 
pamphlet, 
The 
Dictatorship 
of 
the 
Proletariat, 
published 
in 
August 
1918, 
i.e., 
long 
after 
the 
first 
edition 
of 
the 
present 
book, 
is 
a 
perfect 
example 
of 
petty-bourgeois 
distortion 
of 
Marxism 
and 
base 
renunciation 
of 
it 
in 
deeds, 
while 
hypocritically 
recognizing 
it 
in 
words 
(see 
my 
pamphlet, 
The 
Proletarian 
Revolution 
and 
the 
Renegade 
Kautsky, 
Petrograd 
and 
Moscow, 
1918). 


Opportunism 
today, 
as 
represented 
by 
its 
principal 
spokesman, 
the 
ex-
Marxist 
Karl 
Kautsky, 
fits 
in 
completely 
with 
Marx's 
characterization 
of 
the 
bourgeois 
position 
quoted 
above, 
for 
this 
opportunism 
limits 
recognition 
of 
the 
class 
struggle 
to 
the 
sphere 
of 
bourgeois 
relations. 
(Within 
this 
sphere, 
within 
its 
framework, 
not 
a 
single 
educated 
liberal 
will 
refuse 
to 
recognize 
the 
class 
struggle 
"in 
principle"!) 
Opportunism 
does 
not 
extend 
recognition 
of 
the 
class 
struggle 
to 
the 
cardinal 
point, 
to 
the 
period 
of 
transition 
from 
capitalism 
to 
communism, 
of 
the 
overthrow 
and 
the 
complete 
abolition 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
In 
reality, 
this 
period 
inevitably 
is 
a 
period 
of 
an 
unprecedently 
violent 
class 
struggle 
in 
unprecedentedly 
acute 
forms, 
and, 
consequently, 
during 
this 
period 
the 
state 
must 
inevitably 
be 
a 
state 
that 
is 
democratic 
in 
a 
new 
way 
(for 
the 
proletariat 
and 
the 
propertyless 
in 
general) 
and 
dictatorial 
in 
a 
new 
way 
(against 
the 
bourgeoisie). 


Further. 
The 
essence 
of 
Marx's 
theory 
of 
the 
state 
has 
been 
mastered 
only 
by 
those 
who 
realize 
that 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
a 
single 
class 
is 
necessary 
not 
only 
for 
every 
class 
society 
in 
general, 
not 
only 
for 
the 
proletariat 
which 
has 
overthrown 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
but 
also 
for 
the 
entire 
historical 
period 
which 
separates 
capitalism 
from 
"classless 
society", 
from 
communism. 
Bourgeois 
states 
are 
most 
varied 
in 
form, 
but 
their 
essence 
is 
the 
same: 
all 
these 
states, 
whatever 
their 
form, 
in 
the 
final 
analysis 
are 
inevitably 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
The 
transition 
from 
capitalism 
to 
communism 
is 
certainly 
bound 
to 
yield 
a 
tremendous 
abundance 
and 
variety 
of 
political 
forms, 
but 
the 
essence 
will 
inevitably 
be 
the 
same: 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat. 



Chapter 
III: 
Experience 
of 
the 
Paris 
Commune 
of 
1871. 
Marx's 
Analysis 



1. 
What 
Made 
the 
Communards' 
Attempt 
Heroic? 
It 
is 
well 
known 
that 
in 
the 
autumn 
of 
1870, 
a 
few 
months 
before 
the 
Commune, 
Marx 
warned 
the 
Paris 
workers 
that 
any 
attempt 
to 
overthrow 
the 
government 
would 
be 
the 
folly 
of 
despair. 
But 
when, 
in 
March 
1871, 
a 
decisive 
battle 
was 
forced 
upon 
the 
workers 
and 
they 
accepted 
it, 
when 
the 
uprising 
had 
become 
a 
fact, 
Marx 
greeted 
the 
proletarian 
revolution 
with 
the 
greatest 
enthusiasm, 
in 
spite 
of 
unfavorable 
auguries. 
Marx 
did 
not 
persist 
in 
the 
pedantic 
attitude 
of 
condemning 
an 
“untimely” 
movement 
as 
did 
the 
ill-
famed 
Russian 
renegade 
from 
marxism, 
Plekhanov, 
who 
in 
November 
1905 
wrote 
encouragingly 
about 
the 
workers' 
and 
peasants' 
struggle, 
but 
after 
December 
1905 
cried, 
liberal 
fashion: 
"They 
should 
not 
have 
taken 
up 
arms." 


Marx, 
however, 
was 
not 
only 
enthusiastic 
about 
the 
heroism 
of 
the 
Communards, 
who, 
as 
he 
expressed 
it, 
"stormed 
heaven". 
Although 
the 
mass 
revolutionary 
movement 
did 
not 
achieve 
its 
aim, 
he 
regarded 
it 
as 
a 
historic 
experience 
of 
enormous 
importance, 
as 
a 
certain 
advance 
of 
the 
world 
proletarian 
revolution, 
as 
a 
practical 
step 
that 
was 
more 
important 
than 
hundreds 
of 
programmes 
and 
arguments. 
Marx 
endeavored 
to 
analyze 
this 
experiment, 
to 
draw 
tactical 
lessons 
from 
it 
and 
re-examine 
his 
theory 
in 
the 
light 
of 
it. 


The 
only 
“correction” 
Marx 
thought 
it 
necessary 
to 
make 
to 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto 
he 
made 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
experience 
of 
the 
Paris 
Commune. 



The 
last 
preface 
to 
the 
new 
German 
edition 
of 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto, 
signed 
by 
both 
its 
authors, 
is 
dated 
June 
24, 
1872. 
In 
this 
preface 
the 
authors, 
Karl 
Marx 
and 
Frederick 
Engels, 
say 
that 
the 
programme 
of 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto 
"has 
in 
some 
details 
become 
out-of-date", 
and 
the 
go 
on 
to 
say: 


"… 
One 
thing 
especially 
was 
proved 
by 
the 
Commune, 
viz., 
that 
'the 
working 
class 
cannot 
simply 
lay 
hold 
of 
the 
ready-made 
state 
machinery 
and 
wield 
it 
for 
its 
own 
purposes'…" 


The 
authors 
took 
the 
words 
that 
are 
in 
single 
quotation 
marks 
in 
this 
passage 
from 
Marx's 
book, 
The 
Civil 
War 
in 
France. 


Thus, 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
regarded 
one 
principal 
and 
fundamental 
lesson 
of 
the 
Paris 
Commune 
as 
being 
of 
such 
enormous 
importance 
that 
they 
introduced 
it 
as 
an 
important 
correction 
into 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto. 


Most 
characteristically, 
it 
is 
this 
important 
correction 
that 
has 
been 
distorted 
by 
the 
opportunists, 
and 
its 
meaning 
probably 
is 
not 
known 
to 
nine-
tenths, 
if 
not 
ninety-nine-hundredths, 
of 
the 
readers 
of 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto. 
We 
shall 
deal 
with 
this 
distortion 
more 
fully 
farther 
on, 
in 
a 
chapter 
devoted 
specially 
to 
distortions. 
Here 
it 
will 
be 
sufficient 
to 
note 
that 
the 
current, 
vulgar 
“interpretation” 
of 
Marx's 
famous 
statement 
just 
quoted 
is 
that 
Marx 
here 
allegedly 
emphasizes 
the 
idea 
of 
slow 
development 
in 
contradistinction 
to 
the 
seizure 
of 
power, 
and 
so 
on. 


As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
the 
exact 
opposite 
is 
the 
case. 
Marx's 
idea 
is 
that 
the 
working 
class 
must 
break 
up, 
smash 
the 
"ready-made 
state 
machinery", 
and 
not 
confine 
itself 
merely 
to 
laying 
hold 
of 
it. 


On 
April 
12, 
1871, 
i.e., 
just 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Commune, 
Marx 
wrote 
to 
Kugelmann: 


"If 
you 
look 
up 
the 
last 
chapter 
of 
my 
Eighteenth 
Brumaire, 
you 
will 
find 
that 
I 
declare 
that 
the 
next 
attempt 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution 
will 
be 
no 
longer, 
as 
before, 
to 
transfer 
the 
bureaucratic-military 
machine 
from 
one 
hand 
to 
another, 
but 
to 
smash 
it,[8] 
and 
this 
is 
the 
precondition 
for 
every 
real 
people's 
revolution 
on 
the 
Continent. 
And 
this 
is 
what 
our 
heroic 
Party 
comrades 
in 
Paris 
are 
attempting." 
(Neue 
Zeit, 
Vol.XX, 
1, 
1901-02, 
p. 
709.) 


(The 
letters 
of 
Marx 
to 
Kugelmann 
have 
appeared 
in 
Russian 
in 
no 
less 
than 
two 
editions, 
one 
of 
which 
I 
edited 
and 
supplied 
with 
a 
preface.) 


The 
words, 
"to 
smash 
the 
bureaucratic-military 
machine", 
briefly 
express 
the 
principal 
lesson 
of 
Marxism 
regarding 
the 
tasks 
of 
the 
proletariat 
during 
a 
revolution 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
state. 
And 
this 
is 
the 
lesson 
that 
has 
been 
not 
only 
completely 
ignored, 
but 
positively 
distorted 
by 
the 
prevailing, 
Kautskyite, 



“interpretation” 
of 
Marxism! 


As 
for 
Marx's 
reference 
to 
The 
Eighteenth 
Brumaire, 
we 
have 
quoted 
the 
relevant 
passage 
in 
full 
above. 


It 
is 
interesting 
to 
note, 
in 
particular, 
two 
points 
in 
the 
above-quoted 
argument 
of 
Marx. 
First, 
he 
restricts 
his 
conclusion 
to 
the 
Continent. 
This 
was 
understandable 
in 
1871, 
when 
Britain 
was 
still 
the 
model 
of 
a 
purely 
capitalist 
country, 
but 
without 
a 
militarist 
clique 
and, 
to 
a 
considerable 
degree, 
without 
a 
bureaucracy. 
Marx 
therefore 
excluded 
Britain, 
where 
a 
revolution, 
even 
a 
people's 
revolution, 
then 
seemed 
possible, 
and 
indeed 
was 
possible, 
without 
the 
precondition 
of 
destroying 
"ready-made 
state 
machinery". 


Today, 
in 
1917, 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
first 
great 
imperialist 
war, 
this 
restriction 
made 
by 
Marx 
is 
no 
longer 
valid. 
Both 
Britain 
and 
America, 
the 
biggest 
and 
the 
last 
representatives 
-in 
the 
whole 
world 
-of 
Anglo-Saxon 
“liberty”, 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
they 
had 
no 
militarist 
cliques 
and 
bureaucracy, 
have 
completely 
sunk 
into 
the 
all-European 
filthy, 
bloody 
morass 
of 
bureaucratic-military 
institutions 
which 
subordinate 
everything 
to 
themselves, 
and 
suppress 
everything. 
Today, 
in 
Britain 
and 
America, 
too, 
"the 
precondition 
for 
every 
real 
people's 
revolution" 
is 
the 
smashing, 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
"ready-made 
state 
machinery" 
(made 
and 
brought 
up 
to 
the 
“European”, 
general 
imperialist, 
perfection 
in 
those 
countries 
in 
the 
years 
1914-17). 


Secondly, 
particular 
attention 
should 
be 
paid 
to 
Marx's 
extremely 
profound 
remark 
that 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
bureaucratic-military 
state 
machine 
is 
"the 
precondition 
for 
every 
real 
people's 
revolution". 
This 
idea 
of 
a 
"people's 
revolution 
seems 
strange 
coming 
from 
Marx, 
so 
that 
the 
Russian 
Plekhanovites 
and 
Mensheviks, 
those 
followers 
of 
Struve 
who 
wish 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
Marxists, 
might 
possibly 
declare 
such 
an 
expression 
to 
be 
a 
"slip 
of 
the 
pen" 
on 
Marx's 
part. 
They 
have 
reduced 
Marxism 
to 
such 
a 
state 
of 
wretchedly 
liberal 
distortion 
that 
nothing 
exists 
for 
them 
beyond 
the 
antithesis 
between 
bourgeois 
revolution 
and 
proletarian 
revolution, 
and 
even 
this 
antithesis 
they 
interpret 
in 
an 
utterly 
lifeless 
way. 


If 
we 
take 
the 
revolutions 
of 
the 
20th 
century 
as 
examples 
we 
shall, 
of 
course, 
have 
to 
admit 
that 
the 
Portuguese 
and 
the 
Turkish 
revolutions 
are 
both 
bourgeois 
revolutions. 
Neither 
of 
them, 
however, 
is 
a 
"people's" 
revolution, 
since 
in 
neither 
does 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
people, 
their 
vast 
majority, 
come 
out 
actively, 
independently, 
with 
their 
own 
economic 
and 
political 



demands 
to 
any 
noticeable 
degree. 
By 
contrast, 
although 
the 
Russian 
bourgeois 
revolution 
of 
1905-07 
displayed 
no 
such 
“brilliant” 
successes 
as 
at 
time 
fell 
to 
the 
Portuguese 
and 
Turkish 
revolutions, 
it 
was 
undoubtedly 
a 
"real 
people's" 
revolution, 
since 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
people, 
their 
majority, 
the 
very 
lowest 
social 
groups, 
crushed 
by 
oppression 
and 
exploitation, 
rose 
independently 
and 
stamped 
on 
the 
entire 
course 
of 
the 
revolution 
the 
imprint 
of 
their 
own 
demands, 
their 
attempt 
to 
build 
in 
their 
own 
way 
a 
new 
society 
in 
place 
of 
the 
old 
society 
that 
was 
being 
destroyed. 


In 
Europe, 
in 
1871, 
the 
proletariat 
did 
not 
constitute 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
people 
in 
any 
country 
on 
the 
Continent. 
A 
"people's" 
revolution, 
one 
actually 
sweeping 
the 
majority 
into 
its 
stream, 
could 
be 
such 
only 
if 
it 
embraced 
both 
the 
proletariat 
and 
the 
peasants. 
These 
two 
classes 
then 
constituted 
the 
“people”. 
These 
two 
classes 
are 
united 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
"bureaucraticmilitary 
state 
machine" 
oppresses, 
crushes, 
exploits 
them. 
To 
smash 
this 
machine, 
to 
break 
it 
up, 
is 
truly 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
the 
“people”, 
of 
their 
majority, 
of 
the 
workers 
and 
most 
of 
the 
peasants, 
is 
"the 
precondition" 
for 
a 
free 
alliance 
of 
the 
poor 
peasant 
and 
the 
proletarians, 
whereas 
without 
such 
an 
alliance 
democracy 
is 
unstable 
and 
socialist 
transformation 
is 
impossible. 


As 
is 
well 
known, 
the 
Paris 
Commune 
was 
actually 
working 
its 
way 
toward 
such 
an 
alliance, 
although 
it 
did 
not 
reach 
its 
goal 
owing 
to 
a 
number 
of 
circumstances, 
internal 
and 
external. 


Consequently, 
in 
speaking 
of 
a 
"real 
people's 
revolution", 
Marx, 
without 
in 
the 
least 
discounting 
the 
special 
features 
of 
the 
petty 
bourgeois 
(he 
spoke 
a 
great 
deal 
about 
them 
and 
often), 
took 
strict 
account 
of 
the 
actual 
balance 
of 
class 
forces 
in 
most 
of 
the 
continental 
countries 
of 
Europe 
in 
1871. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
he 
stated 
that 
the 
“smashing” 
of 
the 
state 
machine 
was 
required 
by 
the 
interests 
of 
both 
the 
workers 
and 
the 
peasants, 
that 
it 
united 
them, 
that 
it 
placed 
before 
them 
the 
common 
task 
of 
removing 
the 
“parasite” 
and 
of 
replacing 
it 
by 
something 
new. 


By 
what 
exactly? 



2. 
What 
is 
to 
Replace 
the 
Smashed 
State 
Machine? 
In 
1847, 
in 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto, 
Marx's 
answer 
to 
this 
question 
was 
as 
yet 
a 
purely 
abstract 
one; 
to 
be 
exact, 
it 
was 
an 
answer 
that 
indicated 
he 
tasks, 
but 
not 
the 
ways 
of 
accomplishing 
them. 
The 
answer 
given 
in 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto 
was 
that 
this 
machine 
was 
to 
be 
replaced 
by 
"the 
proletariat 
organized 
as 
the 
ruling 
class", 
by 
the 
"winning 
of 
the 
battle 
of 
democracy". 


Marx 
did 
not 
indulge 
in 
utopias; 
he 
expected 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
mass 
movement 
to 
provide 
the 
reply 
to 
the 
question 
as 
to 
the 
specific 
forms 
this 
organisation 
of 
the 
proletariat 
as 
the 
ruling 
class 
would 
assume 
and 
as 
to 
the 
exact 
manner 
in 
which 
this 
organisation 
would 
be 
combined 
with 
the 
most 
complete, 
most 
consistent 
"winning 
of 
the 
battle 
of 
democracy." 


Marx 
subjected 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
Commune, 
meagre 
as 
it 
was, 
to 
the 
most 
careful 
analysis 
in 
The 
Civil 
War 
in 
France. 
Let 
us 
quote 
the 
most 
important 
passages 
of 
this 
work.[9] 


Originating 
from 
the 
Middle 
Ages, 
there 
developed 
in 
the 
19th 
century 
"the 
centralized 
state 
power, 
with 
its 
ubiquitous 
organs 
of 
standing 
army, 
police, 
bureaucracy, 
clergy, 
and 
judicature." 
With 
the 
development 
of 
class 
antagonisms 
between 
capital 
and 
labor, 
"state 
power 
assumed 
more 
and 
more 
the 
character 
of 
a 
public 
force 
organized 
for 
the 
suppression 
of 
the 
working 
class, 
of 
a 
machine 
of 
class 
rule. 
After 
every 
revolution, 
which 
marks 
an 
advance 
in 
the 
class 
struggle, 
the 
purely 
coercive 
character 
of 
the 
state 
power 
stands 
out 
in 
bolder 
and 
bolder 
relief." 
After 
the 
revolution 
of 
1848-49, 
state 
power 
became 
"the 
national 
war 
instruments 
of 
capital 
against 
labor". 
The 
Second 
Empire 
consolidated 
this. 


"The 
direct 
antithesis 
to 
the 
empire 
was 
the 
Commune." 
It 
was 
the 
"specific 
form" 
of 
"a 
republic 
that 
was 
not 
only 
to 
remove 
the 
monarchical 
form 
of 
class 
rule, 
but 
class 
rule 
itself." 


What 
was 
this 
“specific” 
form 
of 
the 
proletarian, 
socialist 
republic? 
What 
was 
the 
state 
it 
began 
to 
create? 


"The 
first 
decree 
of 
the 
Commune, 
therefore, 
was 
the 
suppression 
of 
the 
standing 
army, 
and 
the 
substitution 
for 
it 
of 
the 
armed 
people." 


This 
demand 
now 
figures 
in 
the 
programme 
of 
every 
party 
calling 
itself 
socialist. 
The 
real 
worth 
of 
their 
programme, 
however, 
is 
best 
shown 
by 
the 
behavior 
of 
our 
Social-Revolutionists 
and 
mensheviks, 
who, 
right 
after 
the 



revolution 
of 
February 
27, 
refused 
to 
carry 
out 
this 
demand! 


"The 
Commune 
was 
formed 
of 
the 
municipal 
councillors, 
chosen 
by 
universal 
suffrage 
in 
the 
various 
wards 
of 
the 
town, 
responsible 
and 
revocable 
at 
any 
time. 
The 
majority 
of 
its 
members 
were 
naturally 
working 
men, 
or 
acknowledged 
representatives 
of 
the 
working 
class… 
The 
police, 
which 
until 
then 
had 
been 
the 
instrument 
of 
the 
Government, 
was 
at 
once 
stripped 
of 
its 
political 
attributes, 
and 
turned 
into 
the 
responsible, 
and 
at 
all 
times 
revocable, 
agent 
of 
the 
Commune. 
So 
were 
the 
officials 
of 
all 
other 
branches 
of 
the 
administration. 
From 
the 
members 
of 
the 
Commune 
downwards, 
the 
public 
service 
had 
to 
be 
done 
at 
workmen's 
wages. 
The 
privileges 
and 
the 
representation 
allowances 
of 
the 
high 
dignitaries 
of 
state 
disappeared 
along 
with 
the 
high 
dignitaries 
themselves… 
Having 
once 
got 
rid 
of 
the 
standing 
army 
and 
the 
police, 
the 
instruments 
of 
physical 
force 
of 
the 
old 
government, 
the 
Commune 
proceeded 
at 
once 
to 
break 
the 
instrument 
of 
spiritual 
suppression, 
the 
power 
of 
the 
priests… 
The 
judicial 
functionaries 
lost 
that 
sham 
independence… 
they 
were 
thenceforward 
to 
be 
elective, 
responsible, 
and 
revocable." 


The 
Commune, 
therefore, 
appears 
to 
have 
replaced 
the 
smashed 
state 
machine 
“only” 
by 
fuller 
democracy: 
abolition 
of 
the 
standing 
army; 
all 
officials 
to 
be 
elected 
and 
subject 
to 
recall. 
But 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
this 
“only” 
signifies 
a 
gigantic 
replacement 
of 
certain 
institutions 
by 
other 
institutions 
of 
a 
fundamentally 
different 
type. 
This 
is 
exactly 
a 
case 
of 
"quantity 
being 
transformed 
into 
quality": 
democracy, 
introduced 
as 
fully 
and 
consistently 
as 
is 
at 
all 
conceivable, 
is 
transformed 
from 
bourgeois 
into 
proletarian 
democracy; 
from 
the 
state 
(= 
a 
special 
force 
for 
the 
suppression 
of 
a 
particular 
class) 
into 
something 
which 
is 
no 
longer 
the 
state 
proper. 


It 
is 
still 
necessary 
to 
suppress 
the 
bourgeoisie 
and 
crush 
their 
resistance. 
This 
was 
particularly 
necessary 
for 
the 
Commune; 
and 
one 
of 
the 
reasons 
for 
its 
defeat 
was 
that 
it 
did 
not 
do 
this 
with 
sufficient 
determination. 
The 
organ 
of 
suppression, 
however, 
is 
here 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
population, 
and 
not 
a 
minority, 
as 
was 
always 
the 
case 
under 
slavery, 
serfdom, 
and 
wage 
slavery. 
And 
since 
the 
majority 
of 
people 
itself 
suppresses 
its 
oppressors, 
a 
'special 
force" 
for 
suppression 
is 
no 
longer 
necessary! 
In 
this 
sense, 
the 
state 
begins 
to 
wither 
away. 
Instead 
of 
the 
special 
institutions 
of 
a 
privileged 
minority 
(privileged 
officialdom, 
the 
chiefs 
of 
the 
standing 
army), 
the 
majority 
itself 
can 
directly 
fulfil 
all 
these 
functions, 
and 
the 
more 
the 
functions 
of 
state 
power 
are 
performed 
by 
the 
people 
as 
a 
whole, 
the 
less 
need 
there 
is 
for 
the 



existence 
of 
this 
power. 


In 
this 
connection, 
the 
following 
measures 
of 
the 
Commune, 
emphasized 
by 
Marx, 
are 
particularly 
noteworthy: 
the 
abolition 
of 
all 
representation 
allowances, 
and 
of 
all 
monetary 
privileges 
to 
officials, 
the 
reduction 
of 
the 
remuneration 
of 
all 
servants 
of 
the 
state 
to 
the 
level 
of 
"workmen's 
wages". 
This 
shows 
more 
clearly 
than 
anything 
else 
the 
turn 
from 
bourgeois 
to 
proletarian 
democracy, 
from 
the 
democracy 
of 
the 
oppressors 
to 
that 
of 
the 
oppressed 
classes, 
from 
the 
state 
as 
a 
"special 
force" 
for 
the 
suppression 
of 
a 
particular 
class 
to 
the 
suppression 
of 
the 
oppressors 
by 
the 
general 
force 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
people-the 
workers 
and 
the 
peasants. 
And 
it 
is 
on 
this 
particularly 
striking 
point, 
perhaps 
the 
most 
important 
as 
far 
as 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
state 
is 
concerned, 
that 
the 
ideas 
of 
Marx 
have 
been 
most 
completely 
ignored! 
In 
popular 
commentaries, 
the 
number 
of 
which 
is 
legion, 
this 
is 
not 
mentioned. 
The 
thing 
done 
is 
to 
keep 
silent 
about 
it 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
piece 
of 
old-fashioned 
“naivete”, 
just 
as 
Christians, 
after 
their 
religion 
had 
been 
given 
the 
status 
of 
state 
religion, 
“forgot” 
the 
“naivete” 
of 
primitive 
Christianity 
with 
its 
democratic 
revolutionary 
spirit. 


The 
reduction 
of 
the 
remuneration 
of 
high 
state 
officials 
seem 
“simply” 
a 
demand 
of 
naive, 
primitive 
democracy. 
One 
of 
the 
“founders” 
of 
modern 
opportunism, 
the 
ex-Social-Democrat 
Eduard 
Bernstein, 
has 
more 
than 
once 
repeated 
the 
vulgar 
bourgeois 
jeers 
at 
“primitive” 
democracy. 
Like 
all 
opportunists, 
and 
like 
the 
present 
Kautskyites, 
he 
did 
not 
understand 
at 
all 
that, 
first 
of 
all, 
the 
transition 
from 
capitalism 
to 
socialism 
is 
impossible 
without 
a 
certain 
“reversion” 
to 
“primitive” 
democracy 
(for 
how 
else 
can 
the 
majority, 
and 
then 
the 
whole 
population 
without 
exception, 
proceed 
to 
discharge 
state 
functions?); 
and 
that, 
secondly, 
"primitive 
democracy" 
based 
on 
capitalism 
and 
capitalist 
culture 
is 
not 
the 
same 
as 
primitive 
democracy 
in 
prehistoric 
or 
precapitalist 
times. 
Capitalist 
culture 
has 
created 
large-scale 
production, 
factories, 
railways, 
the 
postal 
service, 
telephones, 
etc., 
and 
on 
this 
basis 
the 
great 
majority 
of 
the 
functions 
of 
the 
old 
"state 
power" 
have 
become 
so 
simplified 
and 
can 
be 
reduced 
to 
such 
exceedingly 
simple 
operations 
of 
registration, 
filing, 
and 
checking 
that 
they 
can 
be 
easily 
performed 
by 
every 
literate 
person, 
can 
quite 
easily 
be 
performed 
for 
ordinary 
"workmen's 
wages", 
and 
that 
these 
functions 
can 
(and 
must) 
be 
stripped 
of 
every 
shadow 
of 
privilege, 
of 
every 
semblance 
of 
"official 
grandeur". 


All 
officials, 
without 
exception, 
elected 
and 
subject 
to 
recall 
at 
any 
time, 
their 
salaries 
reduced 
to 
the 
level 
of 
ordinary 
"workmen's 
wages" 
-these 



simple 
and 
"self-evident" 
democratic 
measures, 
while 
completely 
uniting 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
workers 
and 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
peasants, 
at 
the 
same 
time 
serve 
as 
a 
bridge 
leading 
from 
capitalism 
to 
socialism. 
These 
measures 
concern 
the 
reorganization 
of 
the 
state, 
the 
purely 
political 
reorganization 
of 
society; 
but, 
of 
course, 
they 
acquire 
their 
full 
meaning 
and 
significance 
only 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
"expropriation 
of 
the 
expropriators" 
either 
bring 
accomplished 
or 
in 
preparation, 
i.e., 
with 
the 
transformation 
of 
capitalist 
private 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
into 
social 
ownership. 


"The 
Commune," 
Marx 
wrote, 
"made 
the 
catchword 
of 
all 
bourgeois 
revolutions, 
cheap 
government, 
a 
reality, 
by 
abolishing 
the 
two 
greatest 
sources 
of 
expenditure-the 
army 
and 
the 
officialdom." 


From 
the 
peasants, 
as 
from 
other 
sections 
of 
the 
petty 
bourgeoisie, 
only 
an 
insignificant 
few 
"rise 
to 
the 
top", 
"get 
on 
in 
the 
world" 
in 
the 
bourgeois 
sense, 
i.e., 
become 
either 
well-to-do, 
bourgeois, 
or 
officials 
in 
secure 
and 
privileged 
positions. 
In 
every 
capitalist 
country 
where 
there 
are 
peasants 
(as 
there 
are 
in 
most 
capitalist 
countries), 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
them 
are 
oppressed 
by 
the 
government 
and 
long 
for 
its 
overthrow, 
long 
for 
“cheap” 
government. 
This 
can 
be 
achieved 
only 
by 
the 
proletariat; 
and 
by 
achieving 
it, 
the 
proletariat 
at 
the 
same 
time 
takes 
a 
step 
towards 
the 
socialist 
reorganization 
of 
the 
state. 



3. 
Abolition 
of 
Parliamentarism 
"The 
Commune," 
Marx 
wrote, 
"was 
to 
be 
a 
working, 
not 
a 
parliamentary, 
body, 
executive 
and 
legislative 
at 
the 
same 
time… 


"Instead 
of 
deciding 
once 
in 
three 
or 
six 
years 
which 
member 
of 
the 
ruling 
class 
was 
to 
represent 
and 
repress[10] 
the 
people 
in 
parliament, 
universal 
suffrage 
was 
to 
serve 
the 
people 
constituted 
in 
communes, 
as 
individual 
suffrage 
serves 
every 
other 
employer 
in 
the 
search 
for 
workers, 
foremen 
and 
accountants 
for 
his 
business." 


Owing 
to 
the 
prevalence 
of 
social-chauvinism 
and 
opportunism, 
this 
remarkable 
criticism 
of 
parliamentarism, 
made 
in 
1871, 
also 
belongs 
now 
to 
the 
"forgotten 
words" 
of 
Marxism. 
The 
professional 
Cabinet 
Ministers 
and 
parliamentarians, 
the 
traitors 
to 
the 
proletariat 
and 
the 
“practical” 
socialists 
of 
our 
day, 
have 
left 
all 
criticism 
of 
parliamentarism 
to 
the 
anarchists, 
and, 
on 
this 
wonderfully 
reasonable 
ground, 
they 
denounce 
all 
criticism 
of 
parliamentarism 
as 
“anarchism”!! 
It 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
the 
proletariat 
of 
the 
“advanced” 
parliamentary 
countries, 
disgusted 
with 
such 
“socialists” 
as 
the 
Scheidemanns, 
Davids, 
Legiens, 
Sembats, 
Renaudels, 
Hendersons, 
Vanderveldes, 
Staunings, 
Brantings, 
Bissolatis, 
and 
Co., 
has 
been 
with 
increasing 
frequency 
giving 
its 
sympathies 
to 
anarcho-syndicalism, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
latter 
is 
merely 
the 
twin 
brother 
of 
opportunism. 


For 
Marx, 
however, 
revolutionary 
dialectics 
was 
never 
the 
empty 
fashionable 
phrase, 
the 
toy 
rattle, 
which 
Plekhanov, 
Kautsky 
and 
others 
have 
made 
of 
it. 
Marx 
knew 
how 
to 
break 
with 
anarchism 
ruthlessly 
for 
its 
inability 
to 
make 
use 
even 
of 
the 
“pigsty” 
of 
bourgeois 
parliamentarism, 
especially 
when 
the 
situation 
was 
obviously 
not 
revolutionary; 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
he 
knew 
how 
to 
subject 
parliamentarism 
to 
genuinely 
revolutionary 
proletarian 
criticism. 


To 
decide 
once 
every 
few 
years 
which 
members 
of 
the 
ruling 
class 
is 
to 
repress 
and 
crush 
the 
people 
through 
parliament-this 
is 
the 
real 
essence 
of 
bourgeois 
parliamentarism, 
not 
only 
in 
parliamentary-constitutional 
monarchies, 
but 
also 
in 
the 
most 
democratic 
republics. 


But 
if 
we 
deal 
with 
the 
question 
of 
the 
state, 
and 
if 
we 
consider 
parliamentarism 
as 
one 
of 
the 
institutions 
of 
the 
state, 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
tasks 
of 
the 
proletariat 
in 
this 
field, 
what 
is 
the 
way 
out 
of 
parliamentarism? 
How 
can 
it 
be 
dispensed 
with? 



Once 
again, 
we 
must 
say: 
the 
lessons 
of 
Marx, 
based 
on 
the 
study 
of 
the 
Commune, 
have 
been 
so 
completely 
forgotten 
that 
the 
present-day 
"Social-
Democrat" 
(i.e., 
present-day 
traitor 
to 
socialism) 
really 
cannot 
understand 
any 
criticism 
of 
parliamentarism 
other 
than 
anarchist 
or 
reactionary 
criticism. 


The 
way 
out 
of 
parliamentarism 
is 
not, 
of 
course, 
the 
abolition 
of 
representative 
institutions 
and 
the 
elective 
principle, 
but 
the 
conversion 
of 
the 
representative 
institutions 
from 
talking 
shops 
into 
“working” 
bodies. 
"The 
Commune 
was 
to 
be 
a 
working, 
not 
a 
parliamentary, 
body, 
executive 
and 
legislative 
at 
the 
same 
time." 


"A 
working, 
not 
a 
parliamentary 
body"-this 
is 
a 
blow 
straight 
from 
the 
shoulder 
at 
the 
present-day 
parliamentarian 
country, 
from 
America 
to 
Switzerland, 
from 
France 
to 
Britain, 
Norway 
and 
so 
forth-in 
these 
countries 
the 
real 
business 
of 
“state” 
is 
performed 
behind 
the 
scenes 
and 
is 
carried 
on 
by 
the 
departments, 
chancelleries, 
and 
General 
Staffs. 
parliament 
is 
given 
up 
to 
talk 
for 
the 
special 
purpose 
of 
fooling 
the 
"common 
people". 
This 
is 
so 
true 
that 
even 
in 
the 
Russian 
republic, 
a 
bourgeois-democratic 
republic, 
all 
these 
sins 
of 
parliamentarism 
came 
out 
at 
once, 
even 
before 
it 
managed 
to 
set 
up 
a 
real 
parliament. 
The 
heroes 
of 
rotten 
philistinism, 
such 
as 
the 
skobelevs 
and 
tseretelis, 
the 
Chernovs 
and 
Avksentyevs, 
have 
even 
succeeded 
in 
polluting 
the 
Soviets 
after 
the 
fashion 
of 
the 
most 
disgusting 
bourgeois 
parliamentarism, 
in 
converting 
them 
into 
mere 
talking 
shops. 
In 
the 
Soviets, 
the 
“socialist” 
Ministers 
are 
fooling 
the 
credulous 
rustics 
with 
phrase-
mongering 
and 
resolutions. 
In 
the 
government 
itself 
a 
sort 
of 
permanent 
shuffle 
is 
going 
on 
in 
order 
that, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
as 
many 
Socialist-
Revolutionaries 
and 
Mensheviks 
as 
possible 
may 
in 
turn 
get 
near 
the 
“pie”, 
the 
lucrative 
and 
honorable 
posts, 
and 
that, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
“attention” 
of 
the 
people 
may 
be 
“engaged”. 
meanwhile 
the 
chancelleries 
and 
army 
staffs 
“do” 
the 
business 
of 
“state”. 


Dyelo 
Naroda, 
the 
organ 
of 
the 
ruling 
Socialist-Revolutionary 
Party, 
recently 
admitted 
in 
a 
leading 
article-with 
the 
matchless 
frankness 
of 
people 
of 
"good 
society", 
in 
which 
“all” 
are 
engaged 
in 
political 
prostitution 
-that 
even 
in 
the 
ministeries 
headed 
by 
the 
“socialists” 
(save 
the 
mark!), 
the 
whole 
bureaucratic 
apparatus 
is 
in 
fact 
unchanged, 
is 
working 
in 
the 
old 
way 
and 
quite 
“freely” 
sabotaging 
revolutionary 
measures! 
Even 
without 
this 
admission, 
does 
not 
the 
actual 
history 
of 
the 
participation 
of 
the 
Socialist-
Revolutionaries 
and 
Mensheviks 
in 
the 
government 
prove 
this? 
It 
is 
noteworthy, 
however, 
that 
in 
the 
ministerial 
company 
of 
the 
Cadets, 
the 



Chernovs, 
Rusanovs, 
Zenzinovs, 
and 
other 
editors 
of 
Dyelo 
Naroda 
have 
so 
completely 
lost 
all 
sense 
of 
shame 
as 
to 
brazenly 
assert, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
mere 
bagetelle, 
that 
in 
“their” 
ministeries 
everything 
is 
unchanged!! 
Revolutionary-democratic 
phrases 
to 
gull 
the 
rural 
Simple 
Simons, 
and 
bureaucracy 
and 
red 
tape 
to 
"gladden 
the 
hearts" 
of 
the 
capitalists-that 
is 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
“honest” 
coalition. 


The 
Commune 
substitutes 
for 
the 
venal 
and 
rotten 
parliamentarism 
of 
bourgeois 
society 
institutions 
in 
which 
freedom 
of 
opinion 
and 
discussion 
does 
not 
degenerate 
into 
deception, 
for 
the 
parliamentarians 
themselves 
have 
to 
work, 
have 
to 
execute 
their 
own 
laws, 
have 
themselves 
to 
test 
the 
results 
achieved 
in 
reality, 
and 
to 
account 
directly 
to 
their 
constituents. 
Representative 
institutions 
remain, 
but 
there 
is 
no 
parliamentarism 
here 
as 
a 
special 
system, 
as 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
between 
the 
legislative 
and 
the 
executive, 
as 
a 
privileged 
position 
for 
the 
deputies. 
We 
cannot 
imagine 
democracy, 
even 
proletarian 
democracy, 
without 
representative 
institutions, 
but 
we 
can 
and 
must 
imagine 
democracy 
without 
parliamentarism, 
if 
criticism 
of 
bourgeois 
society 
is 
not 
mere 
words 
for 
us, 
if 
the 
desire 
to 
overthrow 
the 
rule 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie 
is 
our 
earnest 
and 
sincere 
desire, 
and 
not 
a 
mere 
“election” 
cry 
for 
catching 
workers' 
votes, 
as 
it 
is 
with 
the 
Mensheviks 
and 
Socialist-Revolutionaries, 
and 
also 
the 
Scheidemanns 
and 
Legiens, 
the 
Smblats 
and 
Vanderveldes. 


It 
is 
extremely 
instructive 
to 
note 
that, 
in 
speaking 
of 
the 
function 
of 
those 
officials 
who 
are 
necessary 
for 
the 
Commune 
and 
for 
proletarian 
democracy, 
Marx 
compares 
them 
to 
the 
workers 
of 
"every 
other 
employer", 
that 
is, 
of 
the 
ordinary 
capitalist 
enterprise, 
with 
its 
"workers, 
foremen, 
and 
accountants". 


There 
is 
no 
trace 
of 
utopianism 
in 
Marx, 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
he 
made 
up 
or 
invented 
a 
“new” 
society. 
No, 
he 
studied 
the 
birth 
of 
the 
new 
society 
out 
of 
the 
old, 
and 
the 
forms 
of 
transition 
from 
the 
latter 
to 
the 
former, 
as 
a 
mass 
proletarian 
movement 
and 
tried 
to 
draw 
practical 
lessons 
from 
it. 
He 
“Learned” 
from 
the 
Commune, 
just 
as 
all 
the 
great 
revolutionary 
thinkers 
learned 
unhesitatingly 
from 
the 
experience 
of 
great 
movements 
of 
the 
oppressed 
classes, 
and 
never 
addressed 
them 
with 
pedantic 
“homilies” 
(such 
as 
Plekhanov's: 
"They 
should 
not 
have 
taken 
up 
arms" 
or 
Tsereteli's: 
"A 
class 
must 
limit 
itself"). 


Abolishing 
the 
bureaucracy 
at 
once, 
everywhere 
and 
completely, 
is 
out 
of 
the 
question. 
It 
is 
a 
utopia. 
But 
to 
smash 
the 
old 
bureaucratic 
machine 
at 
once 
and 
to 
begin 
immediately 
to 
construct 
a 
new 
one 
that 
will 
make 
possible 
the 



gradual 
abolition 
of 
all 
bureaucracy-this 
is 
not 
a 
utopia, 
it 
is 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
Commune, 
the 
direct 
and 
immediate 
task 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
proletariat. 


Capitalism 
simplifies 
the 
functions 
of 
“state” 
administration; 
it 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
cast 
“bossing” 
aside 
and 
to 
confine 
the 
whole 
matter 
to 
the 
organization 
of 
the 
proletarians 
(as 
the 
ruling 
class), 
which 
will 
hire 
"workers, 
foremen 
and 
accountants" 
in 
the 
name 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
society. 


We 
are 
not 
utopians, 
we 
do 
not 
“dream” 
of 
dispensing 
at 
once 
with 
all 
administration, 
with 
all 
subordination. 
These 
anarchist 
dreams, 
based 
upon 
incomprehension 
of 
the 
tasks 
of 
the 
proletarian 
dictatorship, 
are 
totally 
alien 
to 
Marxism, 
and, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
serve 
only 
to 
postpone 
the 
socialist 
revolution 
until 
people 
are 
different. 
No, 
we 
want 
the 
socialist 
revolution 
with 
people 
as 
they 
are 
now, 
with 
people 
who 
cannot 
dispense 
with 
subordination, 
control, 
and 
"foremen 
and 
accountants". 


The 
subordination, 
however, 
must 
be 
to 
the 
armed 
vanguard 
of 
all 
the 
exploited 
and 
working 
people, 
i.e., 
to 
the 
proletariat. 
A 
beginning 
can 
and 
must 
be 
made 
at 
once, 
overnight, 
to 
replace 
the 
specific 
“bossing” 
of 
state 
officials 
by 
the 
simple 
functions 
of 
"foremen 
and 
accountants", 
functions 
which 
are 
already 
fully 
within 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
average 
town 
dweller 
and 
can 
well 
be 
performed 
for 
"workmen's 
wages". 


We, 
the 
workers, 
shall 
organize 
large-scale 
production 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
what 
capitalism 
has 
already 
created, 
relying 
on 
our 
own 
experience 
as 
workers, 
establishing 
strict, 
iron 
discipline 
backed 
up 
by 
the 
state 
power 
of 
the 
armed 
workers. 
We 
shall 
reduce 
the 
role 
of 
state 
officials 
to 
that 
of 
simply 
carrying 
out 
our 
instructions 
as 
responsible, 
revocable, 
modestly 
paid 
"foremen 
and 
accountants" 
(of 
course, 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
technicians 
of 
all 
sorts, 
types 
and 
degrees). 
This 
is 
our 
proletarian 
task, 
this 
is 
what 
we 
can 
and 
must 
start 
with 
in 
accomplishing 
the 
proletarian 
revolution. 
Such 
a 
beginning, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
large-scale 
production, 
will 
of 
itself 
lead 
to 
the 
gradual 
"withering 
away" 
of 
all 
bureaucracy, 
to 
the 
gradual 
creation 
of 
an 
order-an 
order 
without 
inverted 
commas, 
an 
order 
bearing 
no 
similarity 
to 
wage 
slavery-an 
order 
under 
which 
the 
functions 
of 
control 
and 
accounting, 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
simple, 
will 
be 
performed 
by 
each 
in 
turn, 
will 
then 
become 
a 
habit 
and 
will 
finally 
die 
out 
as 
the 
special 
functions 
of 
a 
special 
section 
of 
the 
population. 


A 
witty 
German 
Social-Democrat 
of 
the 
seventies 
of 
the 
last 
century 
called 
the 
postal 
service 
an 
example 
of 
the 
socialist 
economic 
system. 
This 
is 
very 
true. 
At 
the 
present 
the 
postal 
service 
is 
a 
business 
organized 
on 
the 
lines 



of 
state-capitalist 
monopoly. 
Imperialism 
is 
gradually 
transforming 
all 
trusts 
into 
organizations 
of 
a 
similar 
type, 
in 
which, 
standing 
over 
the 
“common” 
people, 
who 
are 
overworked 
and 
starved, 
one 
has 
the 
same 
bourgeois 
bureaucracy. 
But 
the 
mechanism 
of 
social 
management 
is 
here 
already 
to 
hand. 
Once 
we 
have 
overthrown 
the 
capitalists, 
crushed 
the 
resistance 
of 
these 
exploiters 
with 
the 
iron 
hand 
of 
the 
armed 
workers, 
and 
smashed 
the 
bureaucratic 
machinery 
of 
the 
modern 
state, 
we 
shall 
have 
a 
splendidly-
equipped 
mechanism, 
freed 
from 
the 
“parasite”, 
a 
mechanism 
which 
can 
very 
well 
be 
set 
going 
by 
the 
united 
workers 
themselves, 
who 
will 
hire 
technicians, 
foremen 
and 
accountants, 
and 
pay 
them 
all, 
as 
indeed 
all 
“state” 
officials 
in 
general, 
workmen's 
wages. 
Here 
is 
a 
concrete, 
practical 
task 
which 
can 
immediately 
be 
fulfilled 
in 
relation 
to 
all 
trusts, 
a 
task 
whose 
fulfilment 
will 
rid 
the 
working 
people 
of 
exploitation, 
a 
task 
which 
takes 
account 
of 
what 
the 
Commune 
had 
already 
begun 
to 
practice 
(particularly 
in 
building 
up 
the 
state). 


To 
organize 
the 
whole 
economy 
on 
the 
lines 
of 
the 
postal 
service 
so 
that 
the 
technicians, 
foremen 
and 
accountants, 
as 
well 
as 
all 
officials, 
shall 
receive 
salaries 
no 
higher 
than 
"a 
workman's 
wage", 
all 
under 
the 
control 
and 
leadership 
of 
the 
armed 
proletariat-that 
is 
our 
immediate 
aim. 
This 
is 
what 
will 
bring 
about 
the 
abolition 
of 
parliamentarism 
and 
the 
preservation 
of 
representative 
institutions. 
This 
is 
what 
will 
rid 
the 
laboring 
classes 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie's 
prostitution 
of 
these 
institutions. 



4. 
Organisation 
of 
National 
Unity 
"In 
a 
brief 
sketch 
of 
national 
organization 
which 
the 
Commune 
had 
no 
time 
to 
develop, 
it 
states 
explicitly 
that 
the 
Commune 
was 
to 
be 
the 
political 
form 
of 
even 
the 
smallest 
village…" 
The 
communes 
were 
to 
elect 
the 
"National 
Delegation" 
in 
Paris. 


"… 
The 
few 
but 
important 
functions 
which 
would 
still 
remain 
for 
a 
central 
government 
were 
not 
to 
to 
be 
suppressed, 
as 
had 
been 
deliberately 
mis-stated, 
but 
were 
to 
be 
transferred 
to 
communal, 
i.e., 
strictly 
responsible, 
officials. 


"… 
National 
unity 
was 
not 
to 
be 
broken, 
but, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
organized 
by 
the 
communal 
constitution; 
it 
was 
to 
become 
a 
reality 
by 
the 
destruction 
of 
state 
power 
which 
posed 
as 
the 
embodiment 
of 
that 
unity 
yet 
wanted 
to 
be 
independent 
of, 
and 
superior 
to, 
the 
nation, 
on 
whose 
body 
it 
was 
but 
a 
parasitic 
excrescence. 
While 
the 
merely 
repressive 
organs 
of 
the 
old 
governmental 
power 
were 
to 
be 
amputated, 
its 
legitimate 
functions 
were 
to 
be 
wrested 
from 
an 
authority 
claiming 
the 
right 
to 
stand 
above 
society, 
and 
restored 
to 
the 
responsible 
servants 
of 
society." 


The 
extent 
to 
which 
the 
opportunists 
of 
present-day 
Social-Democracy 
have 
failed-perhaps 
it 
would 
be 
more 
true 
to 
say, 
have 
refused-to 
understand 
these 
observations 
of 
Marx 
is 
best 
shown 
by 
that 
book 
of 
Herostratean 
fame 
of 
the 
renegade 
Bernstein, 
The 
Premises 
of 
Socialism 
and 
the 
Tasks 
of 
the 
Social-Democrats. 
It 
is 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
above 
passage 
from 
Marx 
that 
Bernstein 
wrote 
that 
"as 
far 
as 
its 
political 
content", 
this 
programme 
"displays, 
in 
all 
its 
essential 
features, 
the 
greatest 
similarity 
to 
the 
federalism 
of 
Proudhon… 
In 
spite 
of 
all 
the 
other 
points 
of 
difference 
between 
Marx 
and 
the 
'petty-bourgeois' 
Proudhon[11] 
on 
these 
points, 
their 
lines 
of 
reasoning 
run 
as 
close 
as 
could 
be." 
Of 
course, 
Bernstein 
continues, 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
municipalities 
is 
growing, 
but 
"it 
seems 
doubtful 
to 
me 
whether 
the 
first 
job 
of 
democracy 
would 
be 
such 
a 
dissolution[12] 
of 
the 
modern 
states 
and 
such 
a 
complete 
transformation[13] 
of 
their 
organization 
as 
is 
visualized 
by 
Marx 
and 
Proudhon 
(the 
formation 
of 
a 
National 
Assembly 
from 
delegates 
of 
the 
provincial 
of 
district 
assemblies, 
which, 
in 
their 
turn, 
would 
consist 
of 
delegates 
from 
the 
communes), 
so 
that 
consequently 
the 
previous 
mode 
of 
national 
representation 
would 
disappear." 
(Bernstein, 
Premises, 
German 
edition, 
1899, 
pp.134 
and 
136) 



To 
confuse 
Marx's 
view 
on 
the 
"destruction 
of 
state 
power, 
a 
parasitic 
excrescence", 
with 
Proudhon's 
federalism 
is 
positively 
monstrous! 
But 
it 
is 
no 
accident, 
for 
it 
never 
occurs 
to 
the 
opportunist 
that 
Marx 
does 
not 
speak 
here 
at 
all 
about 
federalism 
as 
opposed 
to 
centralism, 
but 
about 
smashing 
the 
old, 
bourgeois 
state 
machine 
which 
exists 
in 
all 
bourgeois 
countries. 


The 
only 
thing 
that 
does 
occur 
to 
the 
opportunist 
is 
what 
he 
sees 
around 
him, 
in 
an 
environment 
of 
petty-bourgeois 
philistinism 
and 
“reformists” 
stagnation, 
namely, 
only 
“municipalities”! 
The 
opportunist 
has 
even 
grown 
out 
of 
the 
habit 
of 
thinking 
about 
proletarian 
revolution. 


It 
is 
ridiculous. 
But 
the 
remarkable 
thing 
is 
that 
nobody 
argued 
with 
Bernstein 
on 
this 
point. 
Bernstein 
has 
been 
refuted 
by 
many, 
especially 
by 
Plekhanov 
in 
Russian 
literature 
and 
by 
Kautsky 
in 
European 
literature, 
but 
neither 
of 
them 
has 
said 
anything 
about 
this 
distortion 
of 
Marx 
by 
Bernstein. 


The 
opportunist 
has 
so 
much 
forgotten 
how 
to 
think 
in 
a 
revolutionary 
way 
and 
to 
dwell 
on 
revolution 
that 
he 
attributes 
“federalism” 
to 
Marx, 
whom 
he 
confuses 
with 
the 
founder 
of 
anarchism, 
Proudhon. 
As 
for 
Kautsky 
and 
Plekhanov, 
who 
claim 
to 
be 
orthodox 
Marxists 
and 
defenders 
of 
the 
theory 
of 
revolutionary 
Marxism, 
they 
are 
silent 
on 
this 
point! 
Here 
is 
one 
of 
the 
roots 
of 
the 
extreme 
vulgarization 
of 
the 
views 
on 
the 
difference 
between 
Marxism 
and 
anarchism, 
which 
is 
characteristic 
of 
both 
the 
Kautskyites 
and 
the 
opportunists, 
and 
which 
we 
shall 
discuss 
again 
later. 


There 
is 
not 
a 
trace 
of 
federalism 
in 
Marx's 
above-quoted 
observation 
on 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
Commune. 
Marx 
agreed 
with 
Proudhon 
on 
the 
very 
point 
that 
the 
opportunist 
Bernstein 
did 
not 
see. 
Marx 
disagreed 
with 
Proudhon 
on 
the 
very 
point 
on 
which 
Bernstein 
found 
a 
similarity 
between 
them. 


Marx 
agreed 
with 
Proudhon 
in 
that 
they 
both 
stood 
for 
the 
“smashing” 
of 
the 
modern 
state 
machine. 
Neither 
the 
opportunists 
nor 
the 
Kautskyites 
wish 
to 
see 
the 
similarity 
of 
views 
on 
this 
point 
between 
Marxism 
and 
anarchism 
(both 
Proudhon 
and 
Bakunin) 
because 
this 
is 
where 
they 
have 
departed 
from 
Marxism. 


Marx 
disagreed 
both 
with 
Proudhon 
and 
Bakunin 
precisely 
on 
the 
question 
of 
federalism 
(not 
to 
mention 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat). 
Federalism 
as 
a 
principle 
follows 
logically 
from 
the 
petty-bourgeois 
views 
of 
anarchism. 
Marx 
was 
a 
centralist. 
There 
is 
no 
departure 
whatever 
from 
centralism 
in 
his 
observations 
just 
quoted. 
Only 
those 
who 
are 
imbued 
with 
the 
philistine 
"superstitious 
belief" 
in 
the 
state 
can 
mistake 
the 
destruction 
of 



the 
bourgeois 
state 
machine 
for 
the 
destruction 
of 
centralism! 


Now 
if 
the 
proletariat 
and 
the 
poor 
peasants 
take 
state 
power 
into 
their 
own 
hands, 
organize 
themselves 
quite 
freely 
in 
communes, 
and 
unite 
the 
action 
of 
all 
the 
communes 
in 
striking 
at 
capital, 
in 
crushing 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
capitalists, 
and 
in 
transferring 
the 
privately-owned 
railways, 
factories, 
land 
and 
so 
on 
to 
the 
entire 
nation, 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
society, 
won't 
that 
be 
centralism? 
Won't 
that 
be 
the 
most 
consistent 
democratic 
centralism 
and, 
moreover, 
proletarian 
centralism? 


Bernstein 
simply 
cannot 
conceive 
of 
the 
possibility 
of 
voluntary 
centralism, 
of 
the 
voluntary 
fusion 
of 
the 
proletarian 
communes, 
for 
the 
sole 
purpose 
of 
destroying 
bourgeois 
rule 
and 
the 
bourgeois 
state 
machine. 
Like 
all 
philistines, 
Bernstein 
pictures 
centralism 
as 
something 
which 
can 
be 
imposed 
and 
maintained 
solely 
from 
above, 
and 
solely 
by 
the 
bureaucracy 
and 
military 
clique. 


As 
though 
foreseeing 
that 
his 
views 
might 
be 
distorted, 
Marx 
expressly 
emphasized 
that 
the 
charge 
that 
the 
Commune 
had 
wanted 
to 
destroy 
national 
unity, 
to 
abolish 
the 
central 
authority, 
was 
a 
deliberate 
fraud. 
Marx 
purposely 
used 
the 
words: 
"National 
unity 
was… 
to 
be 
organized", 
so 
as 
to 
oppose 
conscious, 
democratic, 
proletarian 
centralism 
to 
bourgeois, 
military, 
bureaucratic 
centralism. 


But 
there 
are 
none 
so 
deaf 
as 
those 
who 
will 
not 
hear. 
And 
the 
very 
thing 
the 
opportunists 
of 
present-day 
Social-Democracy 
do 
not 
want 
to 
hear 
about 
it 
the 
destruction 
of 
state 
power, 
the 
amputation 
of 
the 
parasitic 
excrescence. 



5. 
Abolition 
of 
the 
Parasite 
State 
We 
have 
already 
quoted 
Marx's 
words 
on 
the 
subject, 
and 
we 
must 
now 
supplement 
them. 


"It 
is 
generally 
the 
fate 
of 
new 
historical 
creations," 
he 
wrote, 
"to 
be 
mistaken 
for 
the 
counterpart 
of 
older 
and 
even 
defunct 
forms 
of 
social 
life, 
to 
which 
they 
may 
bear 
a 
certain 
likeness. 
Thus, 
this 
new 
Commune, 
which 
breaks[14] 
the 
modern 
state 
power, 
has 
been 
regarded 
as 
a 
revival 
of 
the 
medieval 
communes… 
as 
a 
federation 
of 
small 
states 
(as 
Montesquieu 
and 
the 
Girondins 
visualized 
it)… 
as 
an 
exaggerated 
form 
of 
the 
old 
struggle 
against 
overcentralization… 


"… 
The 
Communal 
Constitution 
would 
have 
restored 
to 
the 
social 
body 
all 
the 
forces 
hitherto 
absorbed 
by 
that 
parasitic 
excrescence, 
the 
'state', 
feeding 
upon 
and 
hampering 
the 
free 
movement 
of 
society. 
By 
this 
one 
act 
it 
would 
have 
initiated 
the 
regeneration 
of 
France… 


"… 
The 
Communal 
Constitution 
would 
have 
brought 
the 
rural 
producers 
under 
the 
intellectual 
lead 
of 
the 
central 
towns 
of 
their 
districts, 
and 
there 
secured 
to 
them, 
in 
the 
town 
working 
men, 
the 
natural 
trustees 
of 
their 
interests. 
The 
very 
existence 
of 
the 
Commune 
involved, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
course, 
local 
self-government, 
but 
no 
longer 
as 
a 
counterpoise 
to 
state 
power, 
now 
become 
superfluous." 


"Breaking 
state 
power", 
which 
as 
a 
"parasitic 
excrescence"; 
its 
“amputation”, 
its 
“smashing”; 
"state 
power, 
now 
become 
superfluous"-these 
are 
the 
expressions 
Marx 
used 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
state 
when 
appraising 
and 
analyzing 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
Commune. 


All 
this 
was 
written 
a 
little 
less 
than 
half 
a 
century 
ago; 
and 
now 
one 
has 
to 
engage 
in 
excavations, 
as 
it 
were, 
in 
order 
to 
bring 
undistorted 
Marxism 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
people. 
The 
conclusions 
drawn 
from 
the 
observation 
of 
the 
last 
great 
revolution 
which 
Marx 
lived 
through 
were 
forgotten 
just 
when 
the 
time 
for 
the 
next 
great 
proletarian 
revolution 
has 
arrived. 


"… 
The 
multiplicity 
of 
interpretations 
to 
which 
the 
Commune 
has 
been 
subjected, 
and 
the 
multiplicity 
of 
interests 
which 
expressed 
themselves 
in 
it 
show 
that 
it 
was 
a 
thoroughly 
flexible 
political 
form, 
while 
all 
previous 
forms 
of 
government 
had 
been 
essentially 
repressive. 
Its 
true 
secret 
was 
this: 
it 
was 
essentially 
a 
working-class 
government, 
the 
result 
of 
the 
struggle 
of 
the 



producing 
against 
the 
appropriating 
class, 
the 
political 
form 
at 
last 
discovered 
under 
which 
the 
economic 
emancipation 
of 
labor 
could 
be 
accomplished… 


"Except 
on 
this 
last 
condition, 
the 
Communal 
Constitution 
would 
have 
been 
an 
impossibility 
and 
a 
delusion…" 


The 
utopians 
busied 
themselves 
with 
“discovering” 
political 
forms 
under 
which 
the 
socialist 
transformation 
of 
society 
was 
to 
take 
place. 
The 
anarchists 
dismissed 
the 
question 
of 
political 
forms 
altogether. 
The 
opportunists 
of 
present-day 
Social-Democracy 
accepted 
the 
bourgeois 
political 
forms 
of 
the 
parliamentary 
democratic 
state 
as 
the 
limit 
which 
should 
not 
be 
overstepped; 
they 
battered 
their 
foreheads 
praying 
before 
this 
“model”, 
and 
denounced 
as 
anarchism 
every 
desire 
to 
break 
these 
forms. 


Marx 
deduced 
from 
the 
whole 
history 
of 
socialism 
and 
the 
political 
struggle 
that 
the 
state 
was 
bound 
to 
disappear, 
and 
that 
the 
transitional 
form 
of 
its 
disappearance 
(the 
transition 
from 
state 
to 
non-state) 
would 
be 
the 
"proletariat 
organized 
as 
the 
ruling 
class". 
Marx, 
however, 
did 
not 
set 
out 
to 
discover 
the 
political 
forms 
of 
this 
future 
stage. 
He 
limited 
himself 
to 
carefully 
observing 
French 
history, 
to 
analyzing 
it, 
and 
to 
drawing 
the 
conclusion 
to 
which 
the 
year 
1851 
had 
led, 
namely, 
that 
matters 
were 
moving 
towards 
destruction 
of 
the 
bourgeois 
state 
machine. 


And 
when 
the 
mass 
revolutionary 
movement 
of 
the 
proletariat 
burst 
forth, 
Marx, 
in 
spite 
of 
its 
failure, 
in 
spite 
of 
its 
short 
life 
and 
patent 
weakness, 
began 
to 
study 
the 
forms 
it 
had 
discovered. 


The 
Commune 
is 
the 
form 
"at 
last 
discovered" 
by 
the 
proletarian 
revolution, 
under 
which 
the 
economic 
emancipation 
of 
labor 
can 
take 
place. 


The 
Commune 
is 
the 
first 
attempt 
by 
a 
proletarian 
revolution 
to 
smash 
the 
bourgeois 
state 
machine; 
and 
it 
is 
the 
political 
form 
"at 
last 
discovered", 
by 
which 
the 
smashed 
state 
machine 
can 
and 
must 
be 
replaced. 


We 
shall 
see 
further 
on 
that 
the 
Russian 
revolutions 
of 
1905 
and 
1917, 
in 
different 
circumstances 
and 
under 
different 
conditions, 
continue 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Commune 
and 
confirm 
Marx's 
brilliant 
historical 
analysis. 



Chapter 
IV: 
Supplementary 
Explanations 
by 
Engels 



Marx 
gave 
the 
fundamentals 
concerning 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
Commune. 
Engels 
returned 
to 
the 
same 
subject 
time 
and 
again, 
and 
explained 
Marx's 
analysis 
and 
conclusions, 
sometimes 
elucidating 
other 
aspects 
of 
the 
question 
with 
such 
power 
and 
vividness 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
deal 
with 
his 
explanations 
specially. 



1. 
The 
Housing 
Question 
In 
his 
work, 
The 
Housing 
Question 
(1872), 
Engels 
already 
took 
into 
account 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
Commune, 
and 
dealt 
several 
times 
with 
the 
tasks 
of 
the 
revolution 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
state. 
It 
is 
interesting 
to 
note 
that 
the 
treatment 
of 
this 
specific 
subject 
clearly 
revealed, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
points 
of 
similarity 
between 
the 
proletarian 
state 
and 
the 
present 
state-points 
that 
warrant 
speaking 
of 
the 
state 
in 
both 
cases-and, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
points 
of 
difference 
between 
them, 
or 
the 
transition 
to 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
state. 


"How 
is 
the 
housing 
question 
to 
be 
settled 
then? 
In 
present-day 
society, 
it 
is 
settled 
just 
as 
any 
other 
social 
question: 
by 
the 
gradual 
economic 
levelling 
of 
demand 
and 
supply, 
a 
settlement 
which 
reproduces 
the 
question 
itself 
again 
and 
again 
and 
therefore 
is 
no 
settlement. 
How 
a 
social 
revolution 
would 
settle 
this 
question 
not 
only 
depends 
on 
the 
circumstances 
in 
each 
particular 
case, 
but 
is 
also 
connected 
with 
much 
more 
far-reaching 
questions, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
fundamental 
of 
which 
is 
the 
abolition 
of 
the 
antithesis 
between 
town 
and 
country. 
As 
it 
is 
not 
our 
task 
to 
create 
utopian 
systems 
for 
the 
organization 
of 
the 
future 
society, 
it 
would 
be 
more 
than 
idle 
to 
go 
into 
the 
question 
here. 
But 
one 
thing 
is 
certain: 
there 
is 
already 
a 
sufficient 
quantity 
of 
houses 
in 
the 
big 
cities 
to 
remedy 
immediately 
all 
real 
'housing 
shortage', 
provided 
they 
are 
used 
judiciously. 
This 
can 
naturally 
only 
occur 
through 
the 
expropriation 
of 
the 
present 
owners 
and 
by 
quartering 
in 
their 
houses 
homeless 
workers 
or 
workers 
overcrowded 
in 
their 
present 
homes. 
As 
soon 
as 
the 
proletariat 
has 
won 
political 
power, 
such 
a 
measure 
prompted 
by 
concern 
for 
the 
common 
good 
will 
be 
just 
as 
easy 
to 
carry 
out 
as 
are 
other 
expropriations 
and 
billetings 
by 
the 
present-day 
state." 
(German 
edition, 
1887, 
p. 
22) 


The 
change 
in 
the 
form 
of 
state 
power 
is 
not 
examined 
here, 
but 
only 
the 
content 
of 
its 
activity. 
Expropriations 
and 
billetings 
take 
place 
by 
order 
even 
of 
the 
present 
state. 
From 
the 
formal 
point 
of 
view, 
the 
proletarian 
state 
will 
also 
“order” 
the 
occupation 
of 
dwellings 
and 
expropriation 
of 
houses. 
But 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
old 
executive 
apparatus, 
the 
bureaucracy, 
which 
is 
connected 
with 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
would 
simply 
be 
unfit 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
orders 
of 
the 
proletarian 
state. 


"… 
It 
must 
be 
pointed 
out 
that 
the 
'actual 
seizure' 
of 
all 
the 
instruments 
of 
labor, 
the 
taking 
possession 
of 
industry 
as 
a 
whole 
by 
the 
working 
people, 
is 



the 
exact 
opposite 
of 
the 
Proudhonist 
'redemption'. 
In 
the 
latter 
case 
the 
individual 
worker 
becomes 
the 
owner 
of 
the 
dwelling, 
the 
peasant 
farm, 
the 
instruments 
of 
labor; 
in 
the 
former 
case, 
the 
'working 
people' 
remain 
the 
collective 
owners 
of 
the 
houses, 
factories 
and 
instruments 
of 
labor, 
and 
will 
hardly 
permit 
their 
use, 
at 
least 
during 
a 
transitional 
period, 
by 
individuals 
or 
associations 
without 
compensation 
for 
the 
cost. 
In 
the 
same 
way, 
the 
abolition 
of 
property 
in 
land 
is 
not 
the 
abolition 
of 
ground 
rent 
but 
its 
transfer, 
if 
in 
a 
modified 
form, 
to 
society. 
The 
actual 
seizure 
of 
all 
the 
instruments 
of 
labor 
by 
the 
working 
people, 
therefore, 
does 
not 
at 
all 
preclude 
the 
retention 
of 
rent 
relations." 
(p.68) 


We 
shall 
examine 
the 
question 
touched 
upon 
in 
this 
passage, 
namely, 
the 
economic 
basis 
for 
the 
withering 
away 
of 
the 
state, 
in 
the 
next 
chapter. 
Engels 
expresses 
himself 
most 
cautiously. 
saying 
that 
the 
proletarian 
state 
would 
“hardly” 
permit 
the 
use 
of 
houses 
without 
payment, 
"at 
least 
during 
a 
transitional 
period". 
The 
letting 
of 
houses 
owed 
by 
the 
whole 
people 
to 
individual 
families 
presupposes 
the 
collection 
of 
rent, 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
control, 
nd 
the 
employment 
of 
some 
standard 
in 
allotting 
the 
housing. 
All 
this 
calls 
for 
a 
certain 
form 
of 
state, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
at 
all 
call 
for 
a 
special 
military 
bureaucratic 
apparatus, 
with 
officials 
occupying 
especially 
privileged 
positions. 
The 
transition 
to 
a 
situation 
in 
which 
it 
will 
be 
possible 
to 
supply 
dwellings 
rent-free 
depends 
on 
the 
complete 
"withering 
away" 
of 
the 
state. 


Speaking 
of 
the 
Blanquists' 
adoption 
of 
the 
fundamental 
position 
of 
Marxism 
after 
the 
Commune 
and 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
its 
experience, 
Engels, 
in 
passing, 
formulates 
this 
position 
as 
follows: 


"… 
Necessity 
of 
political 
action 
by 
the 
proletariat 
and 
of 
its 
dictatorship 
as 
the 
transition 
to 
the 
abolition 
of 
classes 
and, 
with 
them, 
of 
the 
state…" 
(p.55) 


Addicts 
of 
hair-splitting 
criticism, 
or 
bourgeois 
"exterminators 
of 
Marxism", 
will 
perhaps 
see 
a 
contradiction 
between 
this 
recognition 
of 
the 
"abolition 
of 
the 
state" 
and 
repudiation 
of 
this 
formula 
as 
an 
anarchist 
one 
in 
the 
above 
passage 
from 
Anti-Dühring. 
It 
would 
not 
be 
surprising 
if 
the 
opportunists 
classed 
Engels, 
too, 
as 
an 
“anarchist”, 
for 
it 
is 
becoming 
increasingly 
common 
with 
the 
social-chauvinists 
to 
accuse 
the 
internationalists 
of 
anarchism. 


Marxism 
has 
always 
taught 
that 
with 
the 
abolition 
of 
classes 
the 
state 
will 
also 
be 
abolished. 
The 
well-known 
passage 
on 
the 
"withering 
away 
of 
the 
state 
in 
Anti-Dühring 
accuses 
the 
anarchists 
not 
simply 
of 
favoring 
the 



abolition 
of 
the 
state, 
but 
of 
preaching 
that 
the 
state 
can 
be 
abolished 
“overnight”. 


As 
the 
now 
prevailing 
"Social-Democratic" 
doctrine 
completely 
distorts 
the 
relation 
of 
Marxism 
to 
anarchism 
on 
the 
question 
of 
the 
abolition 
of 
the 
state, 
it 
will 
be 
particularly 
useful 
to 
recall 
a 
certain 
controversy 
in 
which 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
came 
out 
against 
the 
anarchists. 



Controversy 
with 
the 
Anarchists 


This 
controversy 
took 
place 
in 
1873. 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
contributed 
articles 
against 
the 
Proudhonists, 
“autonomists” 
or 
"anti-authoritarians", 
to 
an 
Italian 
socialist 
annual, 
and 
it 
was 
not 
until 
1913 
that 
these 
articles 
appeared 
in 
German 
in 
Neue 
Zeit. 


"If 
the 
political 
struggle 
of 
the 
working 
class 
assumes 
revolutionary 
form," 
wrote 
Marx, 
ridiculing 
the 
anarchists 
for 
their 
repudiation 
of 
politics, 
"and 
if 
the 
workers 
set 
up 
their 
revolutionary 
dictatorship 
in 
place 
of 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
they 
commit 
the 
terrible 
crime 
of 
violating 
principles, 
for 
in 
order 
to 
satisfy 
their 
wretched, 
vulgar 
everyday 
needs 
and 
to 
crush 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
they 
give 
the 
state 
a 
revolutionary 
and 
transient 
form, 
instead 
of 
laying 
down 
their 
arms 
and 
abolishing 
the 
state." 
(Neue 
Zeit 
Vol.XXXII, 
1, 
1913-14, 
p.40) 


It 
was 
solely 
against 
this 
kind 
of 
“abolition” 
of 
the 
state 
that 
Marx 
fought 
in 
refuting 
the 
anarchists! 
He 
did 
not 
at 
all 
oppose 
the 
view 
that 
the 
state 
would 
disappear 
when 
classes 
disappeared, 
or 
that 
it 
would 
be 
abolished 
when 
classes 
were 
abolished. 
What 
he 
did 
oppose 
was 
the 
proposition 
that 
the 
workers 
should 
renounce 
the 
use 
of 
arms, 
organized 
violence, 
that 
is, 
the 
state, 
which 
is 
to 
serve 
to 
"crush 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie". 


To 
prevent 
the 
true 
meaning 
of 
his 
struggle 
against 
anarchism 
from 
being 
distorted, 
Marx 
expressly 
emphasized 
the 
"revolutionary 
and 
transient 
form" 
of 
the 
state 
which 
the 
proletariat 
needs. 
The 
proletariat 
needs 
the 
state 
only 
temporarily. 
We 
do 
not 
after 
all 
differ 
with 
the 
anarchists 
on 
the 
question 
of 
the 
abolition 
of 
the 
state 
as 
the 
aim. 
We 
maintain 
that, 
to 
achieve 
this 
aim, 
we 
must 
temporarily 
make 
use 
of 
the 
instruments, 
resources, 
and 
methods 
of 
state 
power 
against 
the 
exploiters, 
just 
as 
the 
temporary 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
oppressed 
class 
is 
necessary 
for 
the 
abolition 
of 
classes. 
Marx 
chooses 
the 
sharpest 
and 
clearest 
way 
of 
stating 
his 
case 
against 
the 
anarchists: 
After 
overthrowing 
the 
yoke 
of 
the 
capitalists, 
should 
the 
workers 
"lay 
down 
their 
arms", 
or 
use 
them 
against 
the 
capitalists 
in 
order 
to 
crush 
their 
resistance? 
But 
what 
is 
the 
systematic 
use 
of 
arms 
by 
ne 
class 
against 
another 
if 
not 
a 
"transient 
form" 
of 
state? 


Let 
every 
Social-Democrat 
ask 
himself: 
Is 
that 
how 
he 
has 
been 
posing 
the 
question 
of 
the 
state 
in 
controversy 
with 
the 
anarchists? 
Is 
that 
how 
it 
has 
been 
posed 
by 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
the 
official 
socialist 
parties 
of 
the 
Second 



International? 


Engels 
expounds 
the 
same 
ideas 
in 
much 
greater 
detail 
and 
still 
more 
popularly. 
First 
of 
all 
he 
ridicules 
the 
muddled 
ideas 
of 
the 
Proudhonists, 
who 
call 
themselves 
"anti-authoritarians", 
i.e., 
repudiated 
all 
authority, 
all 
subordination, 
all 
power. 
Take 
a 
factory, 
a 
railway, 
a 
ship 
on 
the 
high 
seas, 
said 
Engels: 
is 
it 
not 
clear 
that 
not 
one 
of 
these 
complex 
technical 
establishments, 
based 
on 
the 
use 
of 
machinery 
and 
the 
systematic 
cooperation 
of 
many 
people, 
could 
function 
without 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
subordination 
and, 
consequently, 
without 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
authority 
or 
power? 


"… 
When 
I 
counter 
the 
most 
rabid 
anti-authoritarians 
with 
these 
arguments, 
they 
only 
answer 
they 
can 
give 
me 
is 
the 
following: 
Oh, 
that's 
true, 
except 
that 
here 
it 
is 
not 
a 
question 
of 
authority 
with 
which 
we 
vest 
our 
delegates, 
but 
of 
a 
commission! 
These 
people 
imagine 
they 
can 
change 
a 
thing 
by 
changing 
its 
name…" 


Having 
thus 
shown 
that 
authority 
and 
autonomy 
are 
relative 
terms, 
that 
the 
sphere 
of 
their 
application 
varies 
with 
the 
various 
phases 
of 
social 
development, 
that 
it 
is 
absurd 
to 
take 
them 
as 
absolutes, 
and 
adding 
that 
the 
sphere 
of 
application 
of 
machinery 
and 
large-scale 
production 
is 
steadily 
expanding, 
Engels 
passes 
from 
the 
general 
discussion 
of 
authority 
to 
the 
question 
of 
the 
state. 


"Had 
the 
autonomists," 
he 
wrote, 
"contented 
themselves 
with 
saying 
that 
the 
social 
organization 
of 
the 
future 
would 
allow 
authority 
only 
within 
the 
bounds 
which 
the 
conditions 
of 
production 
make 
inevitable, 
one 
could 
have 
come 
to 
terms 
with 
them. 
But 
they 
are 
blind 
to 
all 
facts 
that 
make 
authority 
necessary 
and 
they 
passionately 
fight 
the 
word. 


"Why 
do 
the 
anti-authoritarians 
not 
confine 
themselves 
to 
crying 
out 
against 
political 
authority, 
the 
state? 
All 
socialists 
are 
agreed 
that 
the 
state, 
and 
with 
it 
political 
authority, 
will 
disappear 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
coming 
social 
revolution, 
that 
is, 
that 
public 
functions 
will 
lose 
their 
political 
character 
and 
become 
mere 
administrative 
functions 
of 
watching 
over 
social 
interests. 
But 
the 
anti-authoritarians 
demand 
that 
the 
political 
state 
be 
abolished 
at 
one 
stroke, 
even 
before 
the 
social 
relations 
that 
gave 
both 
to 
it 
have 
been 
destroyed. 
They 
demand 
that 
the 
first 
act 
of 
the 
social 
revolution 
shall 
be 
the 
abolition 
of 
authority. 


"Have 
these 
gentlemen 
ever 
seen 
a 
revolution? 
A 
revolution 
is 
certainly 
the 
most 
authoritarian 
thing 
there 
is; 
it 
is 
an 
act 
whereby 
one 
part 
of 
the 



population 
imposes 
its 
will 
upon 
the 
other 
part 
by 
means 
of 
rifles, 
bayonets 
and 
cannon, 
all 
of 
which 
are 
highly 
authoritarian 
means. 
And 
the 
victorious 
party 
must 
maintain 
its 
rule 
by 
means 
of 
the 
terror 
which 
its 
arms 
inspire 
in 
the 
reactionaries. 
Would 
the 
Paris 
Commune 
have 
lasted 
more 
than 
a 
day 
if 
it 
had 
not 
used 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
armed 
people 
against 
the 
bourgeoisie? 
Cannot 
we, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
blame 
it 
for 
having 
made 
too 
little 
use 
of 
that 
authority? 
Therefore, 
one 
of 
two 
things: 
either 
that 
anti-authoritarians 
down't 
know 
what 
they 
are 
talking 
about, 
in 
which 
case 
they 
are 
creating 
nothing 
but 
confusion. 
Or 
they 
do 
know, 
and 
in 
that 
case 
they 
are 
betraying 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
proletariat. 
In 
either 
case 
they 
serve 
only 
reaction." 
(p.39) 


This 
argument 
touches 
upon 
questions 
which 
should 
be 
examined 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
relationship 
between 
politics 
and 
economics 
during 
the 
withering 
away 
of 
the 
state 
(the 
next 
chapter 
is 
devoted 
to 
this). 
These 
questions 
are: 
the 
transformation 
of 
public 
functions 
from 
political 
into 
simple 
functions 
of 
administration, 
and 
the 
"political 
state". 
This 
last 
term, 
one 
particularly 
liable 
to 
misunderstanding, 
indicates 
the 
process 
of 
the 
withering 
away 
of 
the 
state: 
at 
a 
certain 
stage 
of 
this 
process, 
the 
state 
which 
is 
withering 
away 
may 
be 
called 
a 
non-political 
state. 


Against, 
the 
most 
remarkable 
thing 
in 
this 
argument 
of 
Engels' 
is 
the 
way 
he 
states 
his 
case 
against 
the 
anarchists. 
Social-Democrats, 
claiming 
to 
be 
disciples 
of 
Engels, 
have 
argued 
on 
this 
subject 
against 
the 
anarchists 
millions 
of 
times 
since 
1873, 
but 
they 
have 
not 
argued 
as 
Marxists 
could 
and 
should. 
The 
anarchist 
idea 
of 
abolition 
of 
the 
state 
is 
muddled 
and 
nonrevolutionary-
that 
is 
how 
Engels 
put 
it. 
It 
is 
precisely 
the 
revolution 
in 
its 
rise 
and 
development, 
with 
its 
specific 
tasks 
in 
relation 
to 
violence, 
authority, 
power, 
the 
state, 
that 
the 
anarchists 
refuse 
to 
see. 


The 
usual 
criticism 
of 
anarchism 
by 
present-day 
Social-Democrats 
has 
boiled 
down 
to 
the 
purest 
philistine 
banality: 
"We 
recognize 
the 
state, 
whereas 
the 
anarchists 
do 
not!" 
Naturally, 
such 
banality 
cannot 
but 
repel 
workers 
who 
are 
at 
all 
capable 
of 
thinking 
and 
revolutionary-minded. 
What 
Engels 
says 
is 
different. 
He 
stresses 
that 
all 
socialists 
recognize 
that 
the 
state 
will 
disappear 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
socialist 
revolution. 
He 
then 
deals 
specifically 
with 
the 
question 
of 
the 
revolution 
-the 
very 
question 
which, 
as 
a 
rule, 
the 
Social-Democrats 
evade 
out 
of 
opportunism, 
leaving 
it, 
so 
to 
speak, 
exclusively 
for 
the 
anarchists 
"to 
work 
out". 
And 
when 
dealing 
with 
this 
question, 
Engels 
takes 
the 
bull 
by 
the 
horns; 
he 
asks: 
should 
not 
the 
Commune 
have 
made 
more 
use 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
power 
of 
the 
state, 
that 



is, 
of 
the 
proletariat 
armed 
and 
organized 
as 
the 
ruling 
class? 


Prevailing 
official 
Social-Democracy 
usually 
dismissed 
the 
question 
of 
the 
concrete 
tasks 
of 
the 
proletariat 
in 
the 
revolution 
either 
with 
a 
philistine 
sneer, 
or, 
at 
best, 
with 
the 
sophistic 
evasion: 
"The 
future 
will 
show". 
And 
the 
anarchists 
were 
justified 
in 
saying 
about 
such 
Social-Democrats 
that 
they 
were 
failing 
in 
their 
task 
of 
giving 
the 
workers 
a 
revolutionary 
education. 
Engels 
draws 
upon 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
last 
proletarian 
revolution 
precisely 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
making 
a 
most 
concrete 
study 
of 
what 
should 
be 
done 
by 
the 
proletariat, 
and 
in 
what 
manner, 
in 
relation 
to 
both 
the 
banks 
and 
the 
state. 



Letter 
to 
Bebel 


One 
of 
the 
most, 
if 
not 
the 
most, 
remarkable 
observation 
on 
the 
state 
in 
the 
works 
of 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
is 
contained 
in 
the 
following 
passage 
in 
Engels' 
letter 
to 
Bebel 
dated 
March 
18-28, 
1875. 
This 
letter, 
we 
may 
observe 
in 
parenthesis, 
was, 
as 
far 
as 
we 
know, 
first 
published 
by 
Bebel 
in 
the 
second 
volume 
of 
his 
memoirs 
(Aus 
meinem 
Leben), 
which 
appeared 
in 
1911, 
i.e., 
36 
years 
after 
the 
letter 
had 
been 
written 
and 
sent. 



Engels 
wrote 
to 
Bebel 
criticizing 
the 
same 
draft 
of 
the 
Gotha 
Programme 
which 
Marx 
criticized 
in 
his 
famous 
letter 
to 
Bracke. 
Referring 
specially 
to 
the 
question 
of 
the 
state, 
Engels 
said: 


"The 
free 
people's 
state 
has 
been 
transferred 
into 
the 
free 
state. 
Taken 
in 
its 
grammatical 
sense, 
a 
free 
state 
is 
one 
where 
the 
state 
is 
free 
in 
relation 
to 
its 
citizens, 
hence 
a 
state 
with 
a 
despotic 
government. 
The 
whole 
talk 
about 
the 
state 
should 
be 
dropped, 
especially 
since 
the 
Commune, 
which 
was 
no 
longer 
a 
state 
in 
the 
proper 
sense 
of 
the 
word. 
The 
'people's 
state' 
has 
been 
thrown 
in 
our 
faces 
by 
the 
anarchists 
to 
the 
point 
of 
disgust, 
although 
already 
Marx's 
book 
against 
Proudhon 
and 
later 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto 
say 
plainly 
that 
with 
the 
introduction 
of 
the 
socialist 
order 
of 
society 
the 
state 
dissolves 
of 
itself[15] 
and 
disappears. 
As 
the 
state 
is 
only 
a 
transitional 
institution 
which 
is 
used 
in 
the 
struggle, 
in 
the 
revolution, 
to 
hold 
down 
one's 
adversaries 
by 
force, 
it 
is 
sheer 
nonsense 
to 
talk 
of 
a 
'free 
people's 
state'; 
so 
long 
as 
the 
proletariat 
still 
needs 
the 
state, 
it 
does 
not 
need 
it 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
freedom 



but 
in 
order 
to 
hold 
down 
its 
adversaries, 
and 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
becomes 
possible 
to 
speak 
of 
freedom 
the 
state 
as 
such 
ceases 
to 
exist. 
We 
would 
therefore 
propose 
replacing 
the 
state 
everywhere 
by 
Gemeinwesen, 
a 
good 
old 
German 
word 
which 
can 
very 
well 
take 
the 
place 
of 
the 
French 
word 
commune." 
(pp.321-22 
of 
the 
German 
original.) 


It 
should 
be 
borne 
in 
mind 
that 
this 
letter 
refers 
to 
the 
party 
programme 
which 
Marx 
criticized 
in 
a 
letter 
dated 
only 
a 
few 
weeks 
later 
than 
the 
above 
(Marx's 
letter 
is 
dated 
May 
5, 
1875), 
and 
that 
at 
the 
time 
Engels 
was 
living 
with 
Marx 
in 
London. 
Consequently, 
when 
he 
says 
“we” 
in 
the 
last 
sentence, 
Engels 
undoubtedly, 
in 
his 
own 
as 
well 
as 
in 
Marx's 
name, 
suggests 
to 
the 
leader 
of 
the 
German 
workers' 
party 
that 
the 
word 
“state” 
be 
struck 
out 
of 
the 
programme 
and 
replaced 
by 
the 
word 
“community”. 


What 
a 
howl 
about 
“anarchism” 
would 
be 
raised 
by 
the 
leading 
lights 
of 
present-day 
“Marxism”, 
which 
has 
been 
falsified 
for 
the 
convenience 
of 
the 
opportunists, 
if 
such 
an 
amendment 
of 
the 
programme 
were 
suggested 
to 
them! 


Let 
them 
howl. 
This 
will 
earn 
them 
the 
praises 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie. 


And 
we 
shall 
go 
on 
with 
our 
work. 
In 
revising 
the 
programme 
of 
our 
Party, 
we 
must 
by 
all 
means 
take 
the 
advice 
of 
Engels 
and 
Marx 
into 
consideration 
in 
order 
to 
come 
nearer 
the 
truth, 
to 
restore 
Marxism 
by 
ridding 
it 
of 
distortions, 
to 
guide 
the 
struggle 
of 
the 
working 
class 
for 
its 
emancipation 
more 
correctly. 
Certainly 
no 
one 
opposed 
to 
the 
advice 
of 
Engels 
and 
Marx 
will 
be 
found 
among 
the 
Bolsheviks. 
The 
only 
difficulty 
that 
may 
perhaps 
arise 
will 
be 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
term. 
In 
German 
there 
are 
two 
words 
meaning 
“community”, 
of 
which 
Engels 
used 
the 
one 
which 
does 
not 
denote 
a 
single 
community, 
but 
their 
totality, 
a 
system 
of 
communities. 
In 
Russian 
there 
is 
no 
such 
word, 
and 
we 
may 
have 
to 
choose 
the 
French 
word 
“commune”, 
although 
this 
also 
has 
its 
drawbacks. 


"The 
Commune 
was 
no 
longer 
a 
state 
in 
the 
proper 
sense 
of 
the 
word"this 
is 
the 
most 
theoretically 
important 
statement 
Engels 
makes. 
After 
what 
has 
been 
said 
above, 
this 
statement 
is 
perfectly 
clear. 
The 
Commune 
was 
ceasing 
to 
be 
a 
state 
since 
it 
had 
to 
suppress, 
not 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
population, 
but 
a 
minority 
(the 
exploiters). 
It 
had 
smashed 
the 
bourgeois 
state 
machine. 
In 
place 
of 
a 
special 
coercive 
force 
the 
population 
itself 
came 
on 
the 
scene. 
All 
this 
was 
a 
departure 
from 
the 
state 
in 
the 
proper 
sense 
of 
the 
word. 
And 
had 
the 
Commune 
become 
firmly 
established, 
all 
traces 
of 
the 
state 
in 
it 
would 
have 
"withered 
away" 
of 
themselves; 
it 
would 
not 
have 
had 
to 



“abolish” 
the 
institutions 
of 
the 
state-they 
would 
have 
ceased 
to 
function 
as 
they 
ceased 
to 
have 
anything 
to 
do. 


"The 
'people's 
state' 
has 
been 
thrown 
in 
our 
faces 
by 
the 
anarchists". 
In 
saying 
this, 
Engels 
above 
all 
has 
in 
mind 
Bakunin 
and 
his 
attacks 
on 
the 
German 
Social-Democrats. 
Engels 
admits 
that 
these 
attacks 
were 
justified 
insofar 
as 
the 
"people's 
state" 
was 
as 
much 
an 
absurdity 
and 
as 
much 
a 
departure 
from 
socialism 
as 
the 
"free 
people's 
state". 
Engels 
tried 
to 
put 
the 
struggle 
of 
the 
German 
Social-Democrats 
against 
the 
anarchists 
on 
the 
right 
lines, 
to 
make 
this 
struggle 
correct 
in 
principle, 
to 
ride 
it 
of 
opportunist 
prejudices 
concerning 
the 
“state”. 
Unfortunately, 
Engels' 
letter 
was 
pigeonholed 
for 
36 
years. 
We 
shall 
see 
farther 
on 
that, 
even 
after 
this 
letter 
was 
published, 
Kautsky 
persisted 
in 
virtually 
the 
same 
mistakes 
against 
which 
Engels 
had 
warned. 


Bebel 
replied 
to 
Engels 
in 
a 
letter 
dated 
September 
21, 
1875, 
in 
which 
he 
wrote, 
among 
other 
things, 
that 
he 
"fully 
agreed" 
with 
Engels' 
opinion 
of 
the 
draft 
programme, 
and 
that 
he 
had 
reproached 
Liebknecht 
with 
readiness 
to 
make 
concessions 
(p.334 
of 
the 
German 
edition 
of 
Bebel's 
memoirs, 
Vol.II). 
But 
if 
we 
take 
Bebel's 
pamphlet, 
Our 
Aims, 
we 
find 
there 
views 
on 
the 
state 
that 
are 
absolutely 
wrong. 


"The 
state 
must… 
be 
transformed 
from 
one 
based 
on 
class 
rule 
into 
a 
people's 
state." 
(Unsere 
Ziele, 
1886, 
p.14) 


This 
was 
printed 
in 
the 
ninth 
(ninth!) 
edition 
of 
Bebel's 
pamphlet! 
It 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
opportunist 
views 
on 
the 
state, 
so 
persistently 
repeated, 
were 
absorbed 
by 
the 
German 
Social-Democrats, 
especially 
as 
Engels' 
revolutionary 
interpretations 
had 
been 
safely 
pigeon-holed, 
and 
all 
the 
conditions 
of 
life 
were 
such 
as 
to 
“wean” 
them 
from 
revolution 
for 
a 
long 
time. 



2. 
Criticism 
of 
the 
Draft 
of 
the 
Erfurt 
Programme 
In 
analyzing 
Marxist 
teachings 
on 
the 
state, 
the 
criticism 
of 
the 
draft 
of 
the 
Erfurt 
Programme, 
sent 
by 
Engels 
to 
Kautsky 
on 
June 
29, 
1891, 
and 
published 
only 
10 
years 
later 
in 
Neue 
Zeit, 
cannot 
be 
ignored; 
for 
it 
is 
with 
the 
opportunist 
views 
of 
the 
Social-Democrats 
on 
questions 
of 
state 
organization 
that 
this 
criticism 
is 
mainly 
concerned. 


We 
shall 
note 
in 
passing 
that 
Engels 
also 
makes 
an 
exceedingly 
valuable 
observation 
on 
economic 
questions, 
which 
shows 
how 
attentively 
and 
thoughtfully 
he 
watched 
the 
various 
changes 
occurring 
in 
modern 
capitalism, 
and 
how 
for 
this 
reason 
he 
was 
able 
to 
foresee 
to 
a 
certain 
extent 
the 
tasks 
of 
our 
present, 
the 
imperialist, 
epoch. 
Here 
is 
that 
observation: 
referring 
to 
the 
word 
“planlessness” 
(Planlosigkeit), 
used 
in 
the 
draft 
programme, 
as 
characteristic 
of 
capitalism, 
Engels 
wrote: 


"When 
we 
pass 
from 
joint-stock 
companies 
to 
trusts 
which 
assume 
control 
over, 
and 
monopolize, 
whole 
industries, 
it 
is 
not 
only 
private 
production 
that 
ceases, 
but 
also 
planlessness." 
(Neue 
Zeit, 
Vol. 
XX, 
1, 
190102, 
p.8) 


Here 
was 
have 
what 
is 
most 
essential 
in 
the 
theoretical 
appraisal 
of 
the 
latest 
phase 
of 
capitalism, 
i.e., 
imperialism, 
namely, 
that 
capitalism 
becomes 
monopoly 
capitalism. 
The 
latter 
must 
be 
emphasized 
because 
the 
erroneous 
bourgeois 
reformist 
assertion 
that 
monopoly 
capitalism 
or 
state-monopoly 
capitalism 
is 
no 
longer 
capitalism, 
but 
can 
now 
be 
called 
"state 
socialism" 
and 
so 
on, 
is 
very 
common. 
The 
trusts, 
of 
course, 
never 
provided, 
do 
not 
now 
provide, 
and 
cannot 
provide 
complete 
planning. 
But 
however 
much 
they 
do 
plan, 
however 
much 
the 
capitalist 
magnates 
calculate 
in 
advance 
the 
volume 
of 
production 
on 
a 
national 
and 
even 
on 
an 
international 
scale, 
and 
however 
much 
they 
systematically 
regulate 
it, 
we 
still 
remain 
under 
capitalism-at 
its 
new 
stage, 
it 
is 
true, 
but 
still 
capitalism, 
without 
a 
doubt. 
The 
“proximity” 
of 
such 
capitalism 
to 
socialism 
should 
serve 
genuine 
representatives 
of 
the 
proletariat 
as 
an 
argument 
proving 
the 
proximity, 
facility, 
feasibility, 
and 
urgency 
of 
the 
socialist 
revolution, 
and 
not 
at 
all 
as 
an 
argument 
for 
tolerating 
the 
repudiation 
of 
such 
a 
revolution 
and 
the 
efforts 
to 
make 
capitalism 
look 
more 
attractive, 
something 
which 
all 
reformists 
are 
trying 
to 
do. 


But 
to 
return 
to 
the 
question 
of 
the 
state. 
In 
his 
letter 
Engels 
makes 
three 
particularly 
valuable 
suggestions: 
first, 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
republic; 
second, 
in 



regard 
to 
the 
connection 
between 
the 
national 
question 
and 
state 
organization; 
and, 
third, 
in 
regard 
to 
local 
self-government. 


In 
regard 
to 
the 
republic, 
Engels 
made 
this 
the 
focal 
point 
of 
this 
criticism 
of 
the 
draft 
of 
the 
Erfurt 
Programme. 
And 
when 
we 
recall 
the 
importance 
which 
the 
Erfurt 
Programme 
acquired 
for 
all 
the 
Social-Democrats 
of 
the 
world, 
and 
that 
it 
became 
the 
model 
for 
the 
whole 
Second 
International, 
we 
may 
say 
without 
exaggeration 
that 
Engels 
thereby 
criticizes 
the 
opportunism 
of 
the 
whole 
Second 
International. 


"The 
political 
demands 
of 
the 
draft," 
engels 
wrote, 
"have 
one 
great 
fault. 
It 
lacks[16] 
precisely 
what 
should 
have 
been 
said." 


And, 
later 
on, 
he 
makes 
it 
clear 
that 
the 
German 
Constitution 
is, 
strictly 
speaking, 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
extremely 
reactionary 
Constitution 
of 
1850, 
that 
the 
Reichstag 
is 
only, 
as 
Wilhelm 
Liebknecht 
put 
it, 
"the 
fig 
leaf 
of 
absolutism" 
and 
that 
to 
wish 
"to 
transform 
all 
the 
instruments 
of 
labor 
into 
common 
property" 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
constitution 
which 
legalizes 
the 
existence 
of 
petty 
states 
and 
the 
federation 
of 
petty 
German 
states 
is 
an 
"obvious 
absurdity". 


"To 
touch 
on 
that 
is 
dangerous, 
however," 
Engels 
added, 
knowing 
only 
too 
well 
that 
it 
was 
impossible 
legally 
to 
include 
in 
the 
programme 
the 
demand 
for 
a 
republic 
in 
Germany. 
But 
he 
refused 
to 
merely 
accept 
this 
obvious 
consideration 
which 
satisfied 
“everybody”. 
He 
continued: 
"Nevertheless, 
somehow 
or 
other, 
the 
thing 
has 
to 
be 
attacked. 
How 
necessary 
this 
is 
is 
shown 
precisely 
at 
the 
present 
time 
by 
opportunism, 
which 
is 
gaining 
ground[17] 
in 
a 
large 
section 
of 
the 
Social-Democrat 
press. 
Fearing 
a 
renewal 
of 
the 
Anti-Socialist 
Law, 
or 
recalling 
all 
manner 
of 
overhasty 
pronouncements 
made 
during 
the 
reign 
of 
that 
law, 
they 
now 
want 
the 
Party 
to 
find 
the 
present 
legal 
order 
in 
Germany 
adequate 
for 
putting 
through 
all 
Party 
demands 
by 
peaceful 
means…" 


Engels 
particularly 
stressed 
the 
fundamental 
fact 
that 
the 
German 
Social-
Democrats 
were 
prompted 
by 
fear 
of 
a 
renewal 
of 
the 
Anti-Socialist 
Law, 
and 
explicitly 
described 
it 
as 
opportunism; 
he 
declared 
that 
precisely 
because 
there 
was 
no 
republic 
and 
no 
freedom 
in 
Germany, 
the 
dreams 
of 
a 
“peaceful” 
path 
were 
perfectly 
absurd. 
Engels 
was 
careful 
not 
to 
tie 
his 
hands. 
He 
admitted 
that 
in 
republican 
or 
very 
free 
countries 
"one 
can 
conceive" 
(only 
“conceive”!) 
of 
a 
peaceful 
development 
towards 
socialism, 
but 
in 
Germany, 
he 
repeated, 


"… 
in 
Germany, 
where 
the 
government 
is 
almost 
omnipotent 
and 
the 
Reichstag 
and 
all 
other 
representative 
bodies 
have 
no 
real 
power, 
to 
advocate 



such 
a 
thing 
in 
Germany, 
where, 
moreover, 
there 
is 
no 
need 
to 
do 
so, 
means 
removing 
the 
fig 
leaf 
from 
absolutism 
and 
becoming 
oneself 
a 
screen 
for 
its 
nakedness." 


The 
great 
majority 
of 
the 
official 
leaders 
of 
the 
German 
Social-
Democratic 
Party, 
which 
pigeon-holed 
this 
advice, 
have 
really 
proved 
to 
be 
a 
screen 
for 
absolutism. 


"… 
In 
the 
long 
run 
such 
a 
policy 
can 
only 
lead 
one's 
own 
party 
astray. 
They 
push 
general, 
abstract 
political 
questions 
into 
the 
foreground, 
thereby 
concealing 
the 
immediate 
concrete 
questions, 
which 
at 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
first 
great 
events, 
the 
first 
political 
crisis, 
automatically 
pose 
themselves. 
What 
can 
result 
from 
this 
except 
that 
at 
the 
decisive 
moment 
the 
party 
suddenly 
proves 
helpless 
and 
that 
uncertainty 
and 
discord 
on 
the 
most 
decisive 
issues 
reign 
in 
it 
because 
these 
issues 
have 
never 
been 
discussed?… 


"This 
forgetting 
of 
the 
great, 
the 
principal 
considerations 
for 
the 
momentary 
interests 
of 
the 
day, 
this 
struggling 
and 
striving 
for 
the 
success 
of 
the 
moment 
regardless 
of 
later 
consequences, 
this 
sacrifice 
of 
the 
future 
of 
the 
movement 
for 
its 
present 
may 
be 
'honestly' 
meant, 
but 
it 
is 
and 
remains 
opportunism, 
and 
'honest' 
opportunism 
is 
perhaps 
the 
most 
dangerous 
of 
all… 


"If 
one 
thing 
is 
certain 
it 
is 
that 
our 
party 
and 
the 
working 
class 
can 
only 
come 
to 
power 
in 
the 
form 
of 
the 
democratic 
republic. 
This 
is 
even 
the 
specific 
form 
for 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
as 
the 
Great 
French 
Revolution 
has 
already 
shown…" 


Engels 
realized 
here 
in 
a 
particularly 
striking 
form 
the 
fundamental 
idea 
which 
runs 
through 
all 
of 
Marx's 
works, 
namely, 
that 
the 
democratic 
republic 
is 
the 
nearest 
approach 
to 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat. 
For 
such 
a 
republic, 
without 
in 
the 
least 
abolishing 
the 
rule 
of 
capital, 
and, 
therefore, 
the 
oppression 
of 
the 
masses 
nd 
the 
class 
struggle, 
inevitably 
leads 
to 
such 
an 
extension, 
development, 
unfolding, 
and 
intensification 
of 
this 
struggle 
that, 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
becomes 
possible 
to 
meet 
the 
fundamental 
interests 
of 
the 
oppressed 
masses, 
this 
possibility 
is 
realized 
inevitably 
and 
solely 
through 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
through 
the 
leadership 
of 
those 
masses 
by 
the 
proletariat. 
These, 
too, 
are 
"forgotten 
words" 
of 
marxism 
for 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
Second 
International, 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
have 
been 
forgotten 
was 
demonstrated 
with 
particular 
vividness 
by 
the 
history 
of 
the 
Menshevik 
Party 
during 
the 
first 
six 
months 
of 
the 
Russian 
revolution 
of 
1917. 


On 
the 
subject 
of 
a 
federal 
republic, 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
national 
composition 
of 
the 
population, 
Engels 
wrote: 



"What 
should 
take 
the 
place 
of 
the 
present-day 
Germany?[18] 
In 
my 
view, 
the 
proletariat 
can 
only 
use 
the 
form 
of 
the 
one 
and 
indivisible 
republic. 
In 
the 
gigantic 
territory 
of 
the 
United 
States, 
a 
federal 
republic 
is 
still, 
on 
the 
whole, 
a 
necessity, 
although 
in 
the 
Eastern 
states 
it 
is 
already 
becoming 
a 
hindrance. 
It 
would 
be 
a 
step 
forward 
in 
Britain 
where 
the 
two 
islands 
are 
peopled 
by 
four 
nations 
and 
in 
spite 
of 
a 
single 
Parliament 
three 
different 
systems 
of 
legislation 
already 
exist 
side 
by 
side. 
In 
little 
Switzerland, 
it 
has 
long 
been 
a 
hindrance, 
tolerable 
only 
because 
Switzerland 
is 
content 
to 
be 
a 
purely 
passive 
member 
of 
the 
European 
state 
system. 
For 
Germany, 
federalization 
on 
the 
Swiss 
model 
would 
be 
an 
enormous 
step 
backward. 
Two 
points 
distinguish 
a 
union 
state 
from 
a 
completely 
unified 
state: 
first, 
that 
each 
member 
state, 
each 
canton, 
has 
its 
own 
civil 
and 
criminal 
legislative 
and 
judicial 
system, 
and, 
second, 
that 
alongside 
a 
popular 
chamber 
there 
is 
also 
a 
federal 
chamber 
in 
which 
each 
canton, 
whether 
large 
or 
small, 
votes 
as 
such." 
In 
Germany, 
the 
union 
state 
is 
the 
transition 
to 
the 
completely 
unified 
state, 
and 
the 
"revolution 
from 
above" 
of 
1866 
and 
1870 
must 
not 
be 
reversed 
but 
supplemented 
by 
a 
"movement 
from 
below". 


Far 
from 
being 
indifferent 
to 
the 
forms 
of 
state, 
Engels, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
tried 
to 
analyze 
the 
transitional 
forms 
with 
the 
utmost 
thoroughness 
in 
order 
to 
establish, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
concrete 
historical 
peculiarities 
of 
each 
particular 
case, 
from 
what 
and 
to 
what 
the 
given 
transitional 
form 
is 
passing. 


Approaching 
the 
matter 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
the 
proletariat 
and 
the 
proletarian 
revolution, 
Engels, 
like 
Marx, 
upheld 
democratic 
centralism, 
the 
republic-one 
and 
indivisible. 
He 
regarded 
the 
federal 
republic 
either 
as 
an 
exception 
and 
a 
hindrance 
to 
development, 
or 
as 
a 
transition 
from 
a 
monarchy 
to 
a 
centralized 
republic, 
as 
a 
"step 
forward" 
under 
certain 
special 
conditions. 
And 
among 
these 
special 
conditions, 
he 
puts 
the 
national 
question 
to 
the 
fore. 


Although 
mercilessly 
criticizing 
the 
reactionary 
nature 
of 
small 
states, 
and 
the 
screening 
of 
this 
by 
the 
national 
question 
in 
certain 
concrete 
cases, 
Engels, 
like 
Marx, 
never 
betrayed 
the 
slightest 
desire 
to 
brush 
aside 
the 
national 
question-a 
desire 
of 
which 
the 
Dutch 
and 
Polish 
Marxists, 
who 
proceed 
from 
their 
perfectly 
justified 
opposition 
to 
the 
narrow 
philistine 
nationalism 
of 
“their” 
little 
states, 
are 
often 
guilty. 


Even 
in 
regard 
to 
britain, 
where 
geographical 
conditions, 
a 
common 
language 
and 
the 
history 
of 
many 
centuries 
would 
seem 
to 
have 
"put 
an 
end" 
to 
the 
national 
question 
in 
the 
various 
small 
divisions 
of 
the 
country-even 
in 
regard 
to 
to 
that 
country, 
Engels 
reckoned 
with 
the 
plain 
fact 
that 
the 
national 



question 
was 
not 
yet 
a 
thing 
of 
the 
past, 
and 
recognized 
in 
consequence 
that 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
federal 
republic 
would 
be 
a 
"step 
forward". 
Of 
course, 
there 
is 
not 
the 
slightest 
hint 
here 
of 
Engels 
abandoning 
the 
criticism 
of 
the 
shortcomings 
of 
a 
federal 
republic 
or 
renouncing 
the 
most 
determined 
advocacy 
of, 
and 
struggle 
for, 
a 
unified 
and 
centralized 
democratic 
republic. 


But 
Engels 
did 
not 
at 
all 
men 
democratic 
centralism 
in 
the 
bureaucratic 
sense 
in 
which 
the 
term 
is 
used 
by 
bourgeois 
and 
petty-bourgeois 
ideologists, 
the 
anarchists 
among 
the 
latter. 
His 
idea 
of 
centralism 
did 
not 
in 
the 
least 
preclude 
such 
broad 
local 
self-government 
as 
would 
combine 
the 
voluntary 
defence 
of 
the 
unity 
of 
the 
state 
by 
the 
“communes” 
and 
districts, 
and 
the 
complete 
elimination 
of 
all 
bureaucratic 
practices 
and 
all 
“ordering” 
from 
above. 
Carrying 
forward 
the 
programme 
views 
of 
Marxism 
on 
the 
state, 
Engels 
wrote: 


"So, 
then, 
a 
unified 
republic-but 
not 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
present 
French 
Republic, 
which 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
Empire 
established 
in 
1798 
without 
the 
Emperor. 
From 
1792 
to 
1798 
each 
French 
department, 
each 
commune,[19] 
enjoyed 
complete 
self-government 
on 
the 
American 
model, 
and 
this 
is 
what 
we 
too 
must 
have. 
How 
self-government 
is 
to 
be 
organized 
and 
how 
we 
can 
manage, 
without 
a 
bureaucracy 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
us 
by 
America 
and 
the 
first 
French 
Republic, 
and 
is 
being 
shown 
even 
today 
by 
Australia, 
Canada 
and 
the 
other 
English 
colonies. 
And 
a 
provincial[20] 
and 
communal 
self-
government 
of 
this 
type 
is 
far 
freer 
than, 
for 
instance, 
Swiss 
federalism, 
under 
which, 
it 
is 
true, 
the 
canton 
is 
very 
independent 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
Bund,[21] 
but 
is 
also 
independent 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
district[22] 
and 
the 
commune. 
The 
cantonal 
governments 
appoint 
the 
district 
governors[23] 
and 
prefects-which 
is 
unknown 
in 
English-speaking 
countries 
and 
which 
we 
want 
to 
abolish 
here 
as 
resolutely 
in 
the 
future 
as 
the 
Prussian 
Landrate 
and 
Regierungsrate" 
(commissioners, 
district 
police 
chiefs, 
governors, 
and 
in 
general 
all 
officials 
appointed 
from 
above). 
Accordingly, 
Engels 
proposes 
the 
following 
words 
for 
the 
self-government 
clause 
in 
the 
programme: 
"Complete 
self-government 
for 
the 
provinces,[24] 
districts 
and 
communes 
through 
officials 
elected 
by 
universal 
suffrage. 
The 
abolition 
of 
all 
local 
and 
provincial 
authorities 
appointed 
by 
the 
state." 


I 
have 
already 
had 
occassion 
to 
point 
out-in 
Pravda 
(No.68, 
May 
28, 
1917), 
which 
was 
suppressed 
by 
the 
government 
of 
Kerensky 
and 
other 
“socialist” 
Ministers-how 
on 
this 
point 
(of 
course, 
not 
on 
this 
point 
alone 
by 



any 
mens) 
our 
pseudo-socialist 
representatives 
of 
pseudo-revolutionary 
pseudo-democracy 
have 
made 
glaring 
departures 
from 
democracy. 
Naturally, 
people 
who 
have 
bound 
themselves 
by 
a 
“coalition” 
to 
the 
imperialist 
bourgeoisie 
have 
remained 
deaf 
to 
this 
criticism. 


It 
is 
extremely 
important 
to 
note 
that 
Engels, 
armed 
with 
facts, 
disproved 
by 
a 
most 
precise 
example 
the 
prejudice 
which 
is 
very 
widespread, 
particularly 
among 
petty-bourgeois 
democrats, 
that 
a 
federal 
republic 
necessarily 
means 
a 
greater 
amount 
of 
freedom 
than 
a 
centralized 
republic. 
This 
is 
wrong. 
It 
is 
disproved 
by 
the 
facts 
cited 
by 
Engels 
regarding 
the 
centralized 
French 
Republic 
of 
792-98 
and 
the 
federal 
Swiss 
Republic. 
The 
really 
democratic 
centralized 
republic 
gave 
more 
freedom 
that 
the 
federal 
republic. 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
greatest 
amount 
of 
local, 
regional, 
and 
other 
freedom 
known 
in 
history 
was 
accorded 
by 
a 
centralized 
and 
not 
a 
federal 
republic. 


Insufficient 
attention 
has 
been 
and 
is 
being 
paid 
in 
our 
Party 
propaganda 
and 
agitation 
to 
this 
fact, 
as, 
indeed, 
to 
the 
whole 
question 
of 
the 
federal 
and 
the 
centralized 
republic 
and 
local 
self-government. 



The 
1891 
Preface 
to 
Marx's 
"The 
Civil 
War 
in 
France" 


In 
his 
preface 
to 
the 
third 
edition 
of 
The 
Civil 
War 
in 
France 
(this 
preface 
is 
dated 
March 
18, 
1891, 
and 
was 
originally 
published 
in 
Neue 
Zeit), 
Engels, 
in 
addition 
to 
some 
interesting 
incidental 
remarks 
on 
questions 
concerning 
the 
attitude 
towards 
the 
state, 
gave 
a 
remarkably 
vivid 
summary 
of 
the 
lessons 
of 
the 
Commune. 
This 
summary, 
made 
more 
profound 
by 
the 
entire 
experience 
of 
the 
20 
years 
that 
separated 
the 
author 
from 
the 
Commune, 
and 
directed 
expressly 
against 
the 
"superstitious 
belief 
in 
the 
state" 
so 
widespread 
in 
Germany, 
may 
justly 
be 
called 
the 
last 
word 
of 
Marxism 
on 
the 
question 
under 
consideration. 


In 
France, 
Engels 
observed, 
the 
workers 
emerged 
with 
arms 
from 
every 
revolution: 
"therefore 
the 
disarming 
of 
the 
workers 
was 
the 
first 
commandment 
for 
the 
bourgeois, 
who 
were 
at 
the 
helm 
of 
the 
state. 
Hence, 
after 
every 
revolution 
won 
by 
the 
workers, 
a 
new 
struggle, 
ending 
with 
the 
defeat 
of 
the 
workers." 


This 
summary 
of 
the 
experience 
of 
bourgeois 
revolutions 
is 
as 
concise 
as 
it 
is 
expressive. 
The 
essence 
of 
the 
matter-among 
other 
things, 
on 
the 
question 
of 
the 
state 
(has 
the 
oppressed 
class 
arms?)-is 
here 
remarkably 
well-
grasped. 
It 
is 
precisely 
this 
essence 
that 
is 
most 
often 
evaded 
by 
both 
professors 
influenced 
by 
bourgeois 
ideology, 
and 
by 
petty-bourgeois 
democrats. 
In 
the 
Russian 
revolution 
of 
1917, 
the 
honor 
(Cavaignac 
honor) 
of 
blabbing 
this 
secret 
of 
bourgeois 
revolutions 
fell 
to 
the 
Menshevik, 
would-be 
Marxist, 
Tsereteli. 
In 
his 
“historic” 
speech 
of 
June 
11, 
Tsereteli 
blurted 
out 
that 
the 
bourgeoisie 
were 
determined 
to 
disarm 
the 
Petrograd 
workers-
presenting, 
of 
course, 
this 
decision 
as 
his 
own, 
and 
as 
a 
necessity 
for 
the 
“state” 
in 
general! 


Tsereteli's 
historical 
speech 
of 
June 
11 
will, 
of 
course, 
serve 
every 
historian 
of 
the 
revolution 
of 
1917 
as 
a 
graphic 
illustration 
of 
how 
the 
Social-
Revolutionary 
and 
Menshevik 
bloc, 
led 
by 
Mr. 
Tsereteli, 
deserted 
to 
the 
bourgeoisie 
against 
the 
revolutionary 
proletariat. 


Another 
incidental 
remark 
of 
Engels', 
also 
connected 
with 
the 
question 
of 
the 
state, 
deals 
with 
religion. 
It 
is 
well-known 
that 
the 
German 
Social-
Democrats, 
as 
they 
degenerated 
and 
became 
increasingly 
opportunist, 
slipped 
more 
and 
more 
frequently 
into 
the 
philistine 
misinterpretation 
of 
the 
celebrated 
formula: 
"Religion 
is 
to 
be 
declared 
a 
private 
matter." 
That 
is, 
the 



formula 
was 
twisted 
to 
mean 
that 
religion 
was 
a 
private 
matter 
even 
for 
the 
party 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
proletariat!! 
It 
was 
against 
this 
complete 
betrayal 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
programme 
of 
the 
proletariat 
that 
Engels 
vigorously 
protested. 
In 
1891 
he 
saw 
only 
the 
very 
feeble 
beginnings 
of 
opportunism 
in 
his 
party, 
and, 
therefore, 
he 
expressed 
himself 
with 
extreme 
caution: 


"As 
almost 
only 
workers, 
or 
recognized 
representatives 
of 
the 
workers, 
sat 
in 
the 
Commune, 
its 
decisions 
bore 
a 
decidedly 
proletarian 
character. 
Either 
they 
decreed 
reforms 
which 
the 
republican 
bourgeoisie 
had 
failed 
to 
pass 
solely 
out 
of 
cowardice, 
but 
which 
provided 
a 
necessary 
basis 
for 
the 
free 
activity 
of 
the 
working 
class-such 
as 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
principle 
that 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
state 
religion 
is 
a 
purely 
private 
matter-or 
the 
Commune 
promulgated 
decrees 
which 
were 
in 
the 
direct 
interest 
of 
the 
working 
class 
and 
in 
part 
cut 
deeply 
into 
the 
old 
order 
of 
society." 


Engels 
deliberately 
emphasized 
the 
words 
"in 
relation 
to 
the 
state" 
as 
a 
straight 
thrust 
at 
at 
German 
opportunism, 
which 
had 
declared 
religion 
to 
be 
a 
private 
matter 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
party, 
thus 
degrading 
the 
party 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
proletariat 
to 
the 
level 
of 
the 
most 
vulgar 
"free-thinking" 
philistinism, 
which 
is 
prepared 
to 
allow 
a 
non-denominational 
status, 
but 
which 
renounces 
the 
party 
struggle 
against 
the 
opium 
of 
religion 
which 
stupifies 
the 
people. 


The 
future 
historian 
of 
the 
German 
Social-Democrats, 
in 
tracing 
the 
roots 
of 
their 
shameful 
bankruptcy 
in 
1914, 
will 
find 
a 
fair 
amount 
of 
interesting 
material 
on 
this 
question, 
beginning 
with 
the 
evasive 
declarations 
in 
the 
articles 
of 
the 
party's 
ideological 
leader, 
Kautsky, 
which 
throw 
the 
door 
wide 
open 
to 
opportunism, 
and 
ending 
with 
the 
attitude 
of 
the 
party 
towards 
the 
"Los-von-Kirche-Bewegung" 
(the 
"Leave-the-Church" 
movement) 
in 
1913. 


But 
let 
us 
see 
how, 
20 
years 
after 
the 
Commune, 
Engels 
summed 
up 
its 
lessons 
for 
the 
fighting 
proletariat. 


Here 
are 
the 
lessons 
to 
which 
Engels 
attached 
prime 
importance: 


"… 
It 
was 
precisely 
the 
oppressing 
power 
of 
the 
former 
centralized 
government, 
army, 
political 
parties, 
bureaucracy, 
which 
Napoleon 
had 
created 
in 
1798 
and 
which 
every 
new 
government 
had 
since 
then 
taken 
over 
as 
a 
welcome 
instrument 
and 
used 
against 
its 
opponents-it 
was 
this 
power 
which 
was 
to 
fall 
everywhere, 
just 
as 
it 
had 
fallen 
in 
Paris. 


"From 
the 
very 
outset 
the 
Commune 
had 
to 
recognize 
that 
the 
working 
class, 
once 
in 
power, 
could 
not 
go 
on 
managing 
with 
the 
old 
state 
machine; 
that 
in 
order 
not 
to 
lose 
again 
its 
only 
just-gained 
supremacy, 
this 
working 



class 
must, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
do 
away 
with 
all 
the 
old 
machinery 
of 
oppression 
previously 
used 
against 
it 
itself, 
and, 
on 
the 
other, 
safeguard 
itself 
against 
its 
own 
deputies 
and 
officials, 
by 
declaring 
them 
all, 
without 
exception, 
subject 
to 
recall 
at 
any 
time…" 


Engels 
emphasized 
once 
again 
that 
not 
only 
under 
a 
monarchy, 
but 
also 
under 
a 
democratic 
republic 
the 
state 
remains 
a 
state, 
i.e., 
it 
retains 
its 
fundamental 
distinguishing 
feature 
of 
transforming 
the 
officials, 
the 
'servants 
of 
society", 
its 
organs, 
into 
the 
masters 
of 
society. 


"Against 
this 
transformation 
of 
the 
state 
and 
the 
organs 
of 
the 
state 
from 
servants 
of 
society 
into 
masters 
of 
society-an 
inevitable 
transformation 
in 
all 
previous 
states-the 
Commune 
used 
two 
infallible 
means. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
it 
filled 
all 
posts-administrative, 
judicial, 
and 
educational-by 
election 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
universal 
suffrage 
of 
all 
concerned, 
subject 
to 
recall 
at 
any 
time 
by 
the 
electors. 
And, 
in 
the 
second 
place, 
it 
paid 
all 
officials, 
high 
or 
low, 
only 
the 
wages 
received 
by 
other 
workers. 
The 
highest 
salary 
paid 
by 
the 
Commune 
to 
anyone 
was 
6,000 
francs. 
In 
this 
way 
a 
dependable 
barrier 
to 
place-hunting 
and 
careerism 
was 
set 
up, 
even 
apart 
from 
the 
binding 
mandates 
to 
delegates 
to 
representative 
bodies, 
which 
were 
added 
besides…" 


Engels 
here 
approached 
the 
interesting 
boundary 
line 
at 
which 
consistent 
democracy, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
is 
transformed 
into 
socialism 
and, 
on 
the 
other, 
demands 
socialism. 
For, 
in 
order 
to 
abolish 
the 
state, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
convert 
the 
functions 
of 
the 
civil 
service 
into 
the 
simple 
operations 
of 
control 
and 
accounting 
that 
are 
within 
the 
scope 
and 
ability 
of 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
the 
population, 
and, 
subsequently, 
of 
every 
single 
individual. 
And 
if 
careerism 
is 
to 
be 
abolished 
completely, 
it 
must 
be 
made 
impossible 
for 
“honorable” 
though 
profitless 
posts 
in 
the 
Civil 
Service 
to 
be 
used 
as 
a 
springboard 
to 
highly 
lucrative 
posts 
in 
banks 
or 
joint-stock 
companies, 
as 
constantly 
happens 
in 
all 
the 
freest 
capitalist 
countries. 


Engels, 
however, 
did 
not 
make 
the 
mistake 
some 
Marxists 
make 
in 
dealing, 
for 
example, 
with 
the 
question 
of 
the 
right 
of 
nations 
to 
self-
determination, 
when 
they 
argue 
that 
is 
is 
impossible 
under 
capitalism 
and 
will 
be 
superfluous 
under 
socialism. 
This 
seemingly 
clever 
but 
actually 
incorrect 
statement 
might 
be 
made 
in 
regard 
to 
any 
democratic 
institution, 
including 
moderate 
salaries 
for 
officials, 
because 
fully 
consistent 
democracy 
is 
impossible 
under 
capitalism, 
and 
under 
socialism 
all 
democracy 
will 
wither 
away. 


This 
is 
a 
sophism 
like 
the 
old 
joke 
about 
a 
man 
becoming 
bald 
by 
losing 



one 
more 
hair. 


To 
develop 
democracy 
to 
the 
utmost, 
to 
find 
the 
forms 
for 
this 
development, 
to 
test 
them 
by 
practice, 
and 
so 
fort-all 
this 
is 
one 
of 
the 
component 
tasks 
of 
the 
struggle 
for 
the 
social 
revolution. 
Taken 
separately, 
no 
kind 
of 
democracy 
will 
bring 
socialism. 
But 
in 
actual 
life 
democracy 
will 
never 
be 
"taken 
separately"; 
it 
will 
be 
"taken 
together" 
with 
other 
things, 
it 
will 
exert 
its 
influence 
on 
economic 
life 
as 
well, 
will 
stimulate 
its 
transformation; 
and 
in 
its 
turn 
it 
will 
be 
influenced 
by 
economic 
development, 
and 
so 
on. 
This 
is 
the 
dialectics 
of 
living 
history. 


Engels 
continued: 


"… 
This 
shattering[25] 
of 
the 
former 
state 
power 
and 
its 
replacement 
by 
a 
new 
and 
truly 
democratic 
one 
is 
described 
in 
detail 
in 
the 
third 
section 
of 
The 
Civil 
War. 
But 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
touch 
briefly 
here 
once 
more 
on 
some 
of 
its 
features, 
because 
in 
Germany 
particularly 
the 
superstitious 
belief 
in 
the 
state 
has 
passed 
from 
philosophy 
into 
the 
general 
consciousness 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie 
and 
even 
of 
many 
workers. 
According 
to 
the 
philosophical 
conception, 
the 
state 
is 
the 
'realization 
of 
the 
idea', 
or 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
God 
on 
earth, 
translated 
into 
philosophical 
terms, 
the 
sphere 
in 
which 
eternal 
truth 
and 
justice 
are, 
or 
should 
be, 
realized. 
And 
from 
this 
follows 
a 
superstitious 
reverence 
for 
the 
state 
and 
everything 
connected 
with 
it, 
which 
takes 
root 
the 
more 
readily 
since 
people 
are 
accustomed 
from 
childhood 
to 
imagine 
that 
the 
affairs 
and 
interests 
common 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
society 
could 
not 
be 
looked 
after 
other 
than 
as 
they 
have 
been 
looked 
after 
in 
the 
past, 
that 
is, 
through 
the 
state 
and 
its 
lucratively 
positioned 
officials. 
And 
people 
think 
they 
have 
taken 
quite 
an 
extraordinary 
bold 
step 
forward 
when 
they 
have 
rid 
themselves 
of 
belief 
in 
hereditary 
monarchy 
and 
swear 
by 
the 
democratic 
republic. 
In 
reality, 
however, 
the 
state 
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
machine 
for 
the 
oppression 
of 
one 
class 
by 
another, 
and 
indeed 
in 
the 
democratic 
republic 
no 
less 
than 
in 
the 
monarchy. 
And 
at 
best 
it 
is 
an 
evil 
inherited 
by 
the 
proletariat 
after 
its 
victorious 
struggle 
for 
class 
supremacy, 
whose 
worst 
sides 
the 
victorious 
proletariat 
will 
have 
to 
lop 
off 
as 
speedily 
as 
possible, 
just 
as 
the 
Commune 
had 
to, 
until 
a 
generation 
reared 
in 
new, 
free 
social 
conditions 
is 
able 
to 
discard 
the 
entire 
lumber 
of 
the 
state." 


Engels 
warned 
the 
Germans 
not 
to 
forget 
the 
principles 
of 
socialism 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
state 
in 
general 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
substitution 
of 
a 
republic 
for 
the 
monarchy. 
His 
warnings 
now 
read 
like 
a 
veritable 
lesson 
to 
the 
Tseretelis 
and 
Chernovs, 
who 
in 
their 
“coalition” 
practice 
have 
revealed 
a 



superstitious 
belief 
in, 
and 
a 
superstitious 
reverence 
for, 
the 
state! 


Two 
more 
remarks. 
1. 
Engels' 
statement 
that 
in 
a 
democratic 
republic, 
"no 
less" 
than 
in 
a 
monarchy, 
the 
state 
remains 
a 
"machine 
for 
the 
oppression 
of 
one 
class 
by 
another" 
by 
no 
means 
signifies 
that 
the 
form 
of 
oppression 
makes 
no 
difference 
to 
the 
proletariat, 
as 
some 
anarchists 
“teach”. 
A 
wider, 
freer 
and 
more 
open 
form 
of 
the 
class 
struggle 
and 
of 
class 
oppression 
vastly 
assists 
the 
proletariat 
in 
its 
struggle 
for 
the 
abolition 
of 
classes 
in 
general. 


2. 
Why 
will 
only 
a 
new 
generation 
be 
able 
to 
discard 
the 
entire 
lumber 
of 
the 
state? 
This 
question 
is 
bound 
up 
with 
that 
of 
overcoming 
democracy, 
with 
which 
we 
shall 
deal 
now. 
Engels 
on 
the 
Overcoming 
of 
Democracy 


Engels 
came 
to 
express 
his 
views 
on 
this 
subject 
when 
establishing 
that 
the 
term 
"Social-Democrat" 
was 
scientifically 
wrong. 


In 
a 
preface 
to 
an 
edition 
of 
his 
articles 
of 
the 
seventies 
on 
various 
subjects, 
mostly 
on 
“international” 
questions 
(Internationales 
aus 
dem 
Volkstaat), 
dated 
January 
3, 
1894, 
i.e., 
written 
a 
year 
and 
a 
half 
before 
his 
death, 
Engels 
wrote 
that 
in 
all 
his 
articles 
he 
used 
the 
word 
“Communist”, 
and 
not 
"Social-Democrat", 
because 
at 
that 
time 
the 
Proudhonists 
in 
France 
and 
the 
Lassalleans 
in 
Germany 
called 
themselves 
Social-Democrats. 


"… 
For 
Marx 
and 
myself," 
continued 
Engels, 
"it 
was 
therefore 
absolutely 
impossible 
to 
use 
such 
a 
loose 
term 
to 
characterize 
our 
special 
point 
of 
view. 
Today 
things 
are 
different, 
and 
the 
word[26] 
may 
perhaps 
pass 
muster,[27] 
inexact[28] 
though 
it 
still 
is 
for 
a 
party 
whose 
economic 
programme 
is 
not 
merely 
socialist 
in 
general, 
but 
downright 
communist, 
and 
whose 
ultimate 
political 
aim 
is 
to 
overcome 
the 
whole 
state 
and, 
consequently, 
democracy 
as 
well. 
The 
names 
of 
real 
political 
parties, 
however, 
are 
never 
wholly 
appropriate; 
the 
party 
develops 
while 
the 
name 
stays." 


The 
dialectician 
Engels 
remained 
true 
to 
dialectics 
to 
the 
end 
of 
his 
days. 
Marx 
and 
I, 
he 
said, 
had 
a 
splendid, 
scientifically 
exact 
name 
for 
the 
party, 
but 
there 
was 
no 
real 
party, 
i.e., 
no 
mass 
proletarian 
party. 
Now 
(at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
19th 
century) 
there 
was 
a 
real 
party, 
but 
its 
name 
was 
scientifically 
wrong. 
Never 
mind, 
it 
would 
"pass 
muster", 
so 
long 
as 
the 
party 
developed, 
so 
long 
as 
the 
scientific 
in 
accuracy 
of 
the 
name 
was 
not 
hidden 
from 
it 
and 
did 
not 
hinder 
its 
development 
on 
the 
right 
direction! 


Perhaps 
some 
wit 
would 
console 
us 
Bolsheviks 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
Engels: 
we 
have 
a 
real 
party, 
it 
is 
developing 
splendidly; 
even 
such 
a 
meaningless 
and 
ugly 
term 
as 
“Bolshevik” 
will 
"pass 
muster", 
although 
it 
expresses 



nothing 
whatever 
but 
the 
purely 
accidental 
fact 
that 
at 
the 
Brussels-London 
Congress 
of 
1903 
we 
were 
in 
the 
majority. 
Perhaps 
now 
that 
the 
persecution 
of 
our 
Party 
by 
republicans 
and 
“revolutionary” 
petty-bourgeois 
democrats 
in 
July 
and 
August 
has 
earned 
the 
name 
“Bolshevik” 
such 
universal 
respect, 
now 
that, 
in 
addition, 
this 
persecution 
marks 
the 
tremendous 
historical 
progress 
our 
Party 
has 
made 
in 
its 
real 
development-perhaps 
now 
even 
I 
might 
hesitate 
to 
insist 
on 
the 
suggestion 
I 
made 
in 
April 
to 
change 
the 
name 
of 
our 
Party. 
Perhaps 
I 
would 
propose 
a 
“compromise” 
to 
my 
comrades, 
namely, 
to 
call 
ourselves 
the 
Communist 
Party, 
but 
to 
retain 
the 
word 
“Bolshevik” 
in 
brackets. 


But 
the 
question 
of 
the 
name 
of 
the 
Party 
is 
incomparably 
less 
important 
than 
the 
question 
of 
the 
attitude 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
proletariat 
to 
the 
state. 


In 
the 
usual 
argument 
about 
the 
state, 
the 
mistake 
is 
constantly 
made 
against 
which 
Engels 
warned 
and 
which 
we 
have 
in 
passing 
indicated 
above, 
namely, 
it 
is 
constantly 
forgotten 
that 
the 
abolition 
of 
the 
state 
means 
also 
the 
abolition 
of 
democracy; 
that 
the 
withering 
away 
of 
the 
state 
means 
the 
withering 
away 
of 
democracy. 


At 
first 
sight 
this 
assertion 
seems 
exceedingly 
strange 
and 
incomprehensible; 
indeed, 
someone 
may 
even 
suspect 
us 
of 
expecting 
the 
advent 
of 
a 
system 
of 
society 
in 
which 
the 
principle 
of 
subordination 
of 
the 
minority 
to 
the 
majority 
will 
not 
be 
observed-for 
democracy 
means 
the 
recognition 
of 
this 
very 
principle. 


No, 
democracy 
is 
not 
identical 
with 
the 
subordination 
of 
the 
minority 
to 
the 
majority. 
Democracy 
is 
a 
state 
which 
recognizes 
the 
subordination 
of 
the 
minority 
to 
the 
majority, 
i.e., 
an 
organization 
for 
the 
systematic 
use 
of 
force 
by 
one 
class 
against 
another, 
by 
one 
section 
of 
the 
population 
against 
another. 


We 
set 
ourselves 
the 
ultimate 
aim 
of 
abolishing 
the 
state, 
i.e., 
all 
organized 
and 
systematic 
violence, 
all 
use 
of 
violence 
against 
people 
in 
general. 
We 
do 
not 
expect 
the 
advent 
of 
a 
system 
of 
society 
in 
which 
the 
principle 
of 
subordination 
of 
the 
minority 
to 
the 
majority 
will 
not 
be 
observed. 
In 
striving 
for 
socialism, 
however, 
we 
are 
convinced 
that 
it 
will 
develop 
into 
communism 
and, 
therefore, 
that 
the 
need 
for 
violence 
against 
people 
in 
general, 
for 
the 
subordination 
of 
one 
man 
to 
another, 
and 
of 
one 
section 
of 
the 
population 
to 
another, 
will 
vanish 
altogether 
since 
people 
will 
become 
accustomed 
to 
observing 
the 
elementary 
conditions 
of 
social 
life 
without 
violence 
and 
without 
subordination. 


In 
order 
to 
emphasize 
this 
element 
of 
habit, 
Engels 
speaks 
of 
a 
new 



generation, 
"reared 
in 
new, 
free 
social 
conditions", 
which 
will 
"be 
able 
to 
discard 
the 
entire 
lumber 
of 
the 
state"-of 
any 
state, 
including 
the 
democratic-
republican 
state. 


In 
order 
to 
explain 
this, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
analyze 
the 
economic 
basis 
of 
the 
withering 
away 
of 
the 
state. 



Chapter 
V: 
The 
Economic 
Basis 
of 
the 
Withering 
Away 
of 
the 
State 



Marx 
explains 
this 
question 
most 
thoroughly 
in 
his 
Critique 
of 
the 
Gotha 
Programme 
(letter 
to 
Bracke, 
May 
5, 
1875, 
which 
was 
not 
published 
until 
1891 
when 
it 
was 
printed 
in 
Neue 
Zeit, 
vol. 
IX, 
1, 
and 
which 
has 
appeared 
in 
Russian 
in 
a 
special 
edition). 
The 
polemical 
part 
of 
this 
remarkable 
work, 
which 
contains 
a 
criticism 
of 
Lassalleanism, 
has, 
so 
to 
speak, 
overshadowed 
its 
positive 
part, 
namely, 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
connection 
between 
the 
development 
of 
communism 
and 
the 
withering 
away 
of 
the 
state. 



1. 
Presentation 
of 
the 
Question 
by 
Marx 
From 
a 
superficial 
comparison 
of 
Marx's 
letter 
to 
Bracke 
of 
May 
5, 
1875, 
with 
Engels' 
letter 
to 
Bebel 
of 
March 
28, 
1875, 
which 
we 
examined 
above, 
it 
might 
appear 
that 
Marx 
was 
much 
more 
of 
a 
"champion 
of 
the 
state" 
than 
Engels, 
and 
that 
the 
difference 
of 
opinion 
between 
the 
two 
writers 
on 
the 
question 
of 
the 
state 
was 
very 
considerable. 


Engels 
suggested 
to 
Bebel 
that 
all 
chatter 
about 
the 
state 
be 
dropped 
altogether, 
that 
the 
word 
“state” 
be 
eliminated 
from 
the 
programme 
altogether 
and 
the 
word 
“community” 
substituted 
for 
it. 
Engels 
even 
declared 
that 
the 
Commune 
was 
long 
a 
state 
in 
the 
proper 
sense 
of 
the 
word. 
Yet 
Marx 
even 
spoke 
of 
the 
"future 
state 
in 
communist 
society", 
i.e., 
he 
would 
seem 
to 
recognize 
the 
need 
for 
the 
state 
even 
under 
communism. 


But 
such 
a 
view 
would 
be 
fundamentally 
wrong. 
A 
closer 
examination 
shows 
that 
Marx's 
and 
Engels' 
views 
on 
the 
state 
and 
its 
withering 
away 
were 
completely 
identical, 
and 
that 
Marx's 
expression 
quoted 
above 
refers 
to 
the 
state 
in 
the 
process 
of 
withering 
away. 


Clearly, 
there 
can 
be 
no 
question 
of 
specifying 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
future 
"withering 
away", 
the 
more 
so 
since 
it 
will 
obviously 
be 
a 
lengthy 
process. 
The 
apparent 
difference 
between 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
is 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
dealt 
with 
different 
subject 
and 
pursued 
different 
aims. 
Engels 
set 
out 
to 
show 
Bebel 
graphically, 
sharply, 
and 
in 
broad 
outline 
the 
utter 
absurdity 
of 
the 
current 
prejudices 
concerning 
the 
state 
(shared 
to 
no 
small 
degree 
by 
Lassalle). 
Marx 
only 
touched 
upon 
this 
question 
in 
passing, 
being 
interested 
in 
another 
subject, 
namely, 
the 
development 
of 
communist 
society. 


The 
whole 
theory 
of 
Marx 
is 
the 
application 
of 
the 
theory 
of 
development-in 
its 
most 
consistent, 
complete, 
considered 
and 
pithy 
form-to 
modern 
capitalism. 
Naturally, 
Marx 
was 
faced 
with 
the 
problem 
of 
applying 
this 
theory 
both 
to 
the 
forthcoming 
collapse 
of 
capitalism 
and 
to 
the 
future 
development 
of 
future 
communism. 


On 
the 
basis 
of 
what 
facts, 
then, 
can 
the 
question 
of 
the 
future 
development 
of 
future 
communism 
be 
dealt 
with? 


On 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
has 
its 
origin 
in 
capitalism, 
that 
it 
develops 
historically 
from 
capitalism, 
that 
it 
is 
the 
result 
of 
the 
action 
of 
a 
social 
force 
to 
which 
capitalism 
gave 
birth. 
There 
is 
no 
trace 
of 
an 
attempt 
on 
Marx's 
part 
to 
make 
up 
a 
utopia, 
to 
indulge 
in 
idle 
guess-work 
about 
what 
cannot 
be 



known. 
Marx 
treated 
the 
question 
of 
communism 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
a 
naturalist 
would 
treat 
the 
question 
of 
the 
development 
of, 
say, 
a 
new 
biological 
variety, 
once 
he 
knew 
that 
it 
had 
originated 
in 
such 
and 
such 
a 
way 
and 
was 
changing 
in 
such 
and 
such 
a 
definite 
direction. 


To 
begin 
with, 
Marx 
brushed 
aside 
the 
confusion 
the 
Gotha 
Programme 
brought 
into 
the 
question 
of 
the 
relationship 
between 
state 
and 
society. 
He 
wrote: 


"'Present-day 
society' 
is 
capitalist 
society, 
which 
exists 
in 
all 
civilized 
countries, 
being 
more 
or 
less 
free 
from 
medieval 
admixture, 
more 
or 
less 
modified 
by 
the 
particular 
historical 
development 
of 
each 
country, 
more 
or 
less 
developed. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
'present-day 
state' 
changes 
with 
a 
country's 
frontier. 
It 
is 
different 
in 
the 
Prusso-German 
Empire 
from 
what 
it 
is 
in 
Switzerland, 
and 
different 
in 
England 
from 
what 
it 
is 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
'The 
present-day 
state' 
is, 
therefore, 
a 
fiction. 


"Nevertheless, 
the 
different 
states 
of 
the 
different 
civilized 
countries, 
in 
spite 
of 
their 
motley 
diversity 
of 
form, 
all 
have 
this 
in 
common, 
that 
they 
are 
based 
on 
modern 
bourgeois 
society, 
only 
one 
more 
or 
less 
capitalistically 
developed. 
The 
have, 
therefore, 
also 
certain 
essential 
characteristics 
in 
common. 
In 
this 
sense 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
'present-day 
state', 
in 
contrast 
with 
the 
future, 
in 
which 
its 
present 
root, 
bourgeois 
society, 
will 
have 
died 
off. 


"The 
question 
then 
arises: 
what 
transformation 
will 
the 
state 
undergo 
in 
communist 
society? 
In 
other 
words, 
what 
social 
functions 
will 
remain 
in 
existence 
there 
that 
are 
analogous 
to 
present 
state 
functions? 
This 
question 
can 
only 
be 
answered 
scientifically, 
and 
one 
does 
not 
get 
a 
flea-hop 
nearer 
to 
the 
problem 
by 
a 
thousandfold 
combination 
of 
the 
word 
people 
with 
the 
word 
state." 


After 
thus 
ridiculing 
all 
talk 
about 
a 
"people's 
state", 
Marx 
formulated 
the 
question 
and 
gave 
warning, 
as 
it 
were, 
that 
those 
seeking 
a 
scientific 
answer 
to 
it 
should 
use 
only 
firmly-established 
scientific 
data. 


The 
first 
fact 
that 
has 
been 
established 
most 
accurately 
by 
the 
whole 
theory 
of 
development, 
by 
science 
as 
a 
whole-a 
fact 
that 
was 
ignored 
by 
the 
utopians, 
and 
is 
ignored 
by 
the 
present-day 
opportunists, 
who 
are 
afraid 
of 
the 
socialist 
revolution-is 
that, 
historically, 
there 
must 
undoubtedly 
be 
a 
special 
stage, 
or 
a 
special 
phase, 
of 
transition 
from 
capitalism 
to 
communism. 



2. 
The 
Transition 
from 
Capitalism 
to 
Communism 
Marx 
continued: 


"Between 
capitalist 
and 
communist 
society 
lies 
the 
period 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
transformation 
of 
the 
one 
into 
the 
other. 
Corresponding 
to 
this 
is 
also 
a 
political 
transition 
period 
in 
which 
the 
state 
can 
be 
nothing 
but 
the 
revolutionary 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat." 


Marx 
bases 
this 
conclusion 
on 
an 
analysis 
of 
the 
role 
played 
by 
the 
proletariat 
in 
modern 
capitalist 
society, 
on 
the 
data 
concerning 
the 
development 
of 
this 
society, 
and 
on 
the 
irreconcilability 
of 
the 
antagonistic 
interests 
of 
the 
proletariat 
and 
the 
bourgeoisie. 


Previously 
the 
question 
was 
put 
as 
follows: 
to 
achieve 
its 
emancipation, 
the 
proletariat 
must 
overthrow 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
win 
political 
power 
and 
establish 
its 
revolutionary 
dictatorship. 


Now 
the 
question 
is 
put 
somewhat 
differently: 
the 
transition 
from 
capitalist 
society-which 
is 
developing 
towards 
communism-to 
communist 
society 
is 
impossible 
without 
a 
"political 
transition 
period", 
and 
the 
state 
in 
this 
period 
can 
only 
be 
the 
revolutionary 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat. 


What, 
then, 
is 
the 
relation 
of 
this 
dictatorship 
to 
democracy? 


We 
have 
seen 
that 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto 
simply 
places 
side 
by 
side 
the 
two 
concepts: 
"to 
raise 
the 
proletariat 
to 
the 
position 
of 
the 
ruling 
class" 
and 
"to 
win 
the 
battle 
of 
democracy". 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
all 
that 
has 
been 
said 
above, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
determine 
more 
precisely 
how 
democracy 
changes 
in 
the 
transition 
from 
capitalism 
to 
communism. 


In 
capitalist 
society, 
providing 
it 
develops 
under 
the 
most 
favourable 
conditions, 
we 
have 
a 
more 
or 
less 
complete 
democracy 
in 
the 
democratic 
republic. 
But 
this 
democracy 
is 
always 
hemmed 
in 
by 
the 
narrow 
limits 
set 
by 
capitalist 
exploitation, 
and 
consequently 
always 
remains, 
in 
effect, 
a 
democracy 
for 
the 
minority, 
only 
for 
the 
propertied 
classes, 
only 
for 
the 
rich. 
Freedom 
in 
capitalist 
society 
always 
remains 
about 
the 
same 
as 
it 
was 
in 
the 
ancient 
Greek 
republics: 
freedom 
for 
the 
slave-owners. 
Owing 
to 
the 
conditions 
of 
capitalist 
exploitation, 
the 
modern 
wage 
slaves 
are 
so 
crushed 
by 
want 
and 
poverty 
that 
"they 
cannot 
be 
bothered 
with 
democracy", 
"cannot 
be 
bothered 
with 
politics"; 
in 
the 
ordinary, 
peaceful 
course 
of 
events, 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
population 
is 
debarred 
from 
participation 
in 
public 
and 
political 
life. 



The 
correctness 
of 
this 
statement 
is 
perhaps 
most 
clearly 
confirmed 
by 
Germany, 
because 
constitutional 
legality 
steadily 
endured 
there 
for 
a 
remarkably 
long 
time-nearly 
half 
a 
century 
(1871-1914)-and 
during 
this 
period 
the 
Social-Democrats 
were 
able 
to 
achieve 
far 
more 
than 
in 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
way 
of 
"utilizing 
legality", 
and 
organized 
a 
larger 
proportion 
of 
the 
workers 
into 
a 
political 
party 
than 
anywhere 
else 
in 
the 
world. 


What 
is 
this 
largest 
proportion 
of 
politically 
conscious 
and 
active 
wage 
slaves 
that 
has 
so 
far 
been 
recorded 
in 
capitalist 
society? 
One 
million 
members 
of 
the 
Social-Democratic 
Party 
-out 
of 
15,000,000 
wage-workers! 


Threemillionorganizedintradeunions-outof15,000,000!
Democracy 
for 
an 
insignificant 
minority, 
democracy 
for 
the 
rich-that 
is 
the 
democracy 
of 
capitalist 
society. 
If 
we 
look 
more 
closely 
into 
the 
machinery 
of 
capitalist 
democracy, 
we 
see 
everywhere, 
in 
the 
“petty”supposedly 
petty-details 
of 
the 
suffrage 
(residential 
qualifications, 
exclusion 
of 
women, 
etc.), 
in 
the 
technique 
of 
the 
representative 
institutions, 
in 
the 
actual 
obstacles 
to 
the 
right 
of 
assembly 
(public 
buildings 
are 
not 
for 
“paupers”!), 
in 
the 
purely 
capitalist 
organization 
of 
the 
daily 
press, 
etc., 
etc.,we 
see 
restriction 
after 
restriction 
upon 
democracy. 
These 
restrictions, 
exceptions, 
exclusions, 
obstacles 
for 
the 
poor 
seem 
slight, 
especially 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
one 
who 
has 
never 
known 
want 
himself 
and 
has 
never 
been 
inclose 
contact 
with 
the 
oppressed 
classes 
in 
their 
mass 
life 
(and 
nine 
out 
of 
10, 
if 
not 
99 
out 
of 
100, 
bourgeois 
publicists 
and 
politicians 
come 
under 
this 
category); 
but 
in 
their 
sum 
total 
these 
restrictions 
exclude 
and 
squeeze 
out 
the 
poor 
from 
politics, 
from 
active 
participation 
in 
democracy. 



Marx 
grasped 
this 
essence 
of 
capitalist 
democracy 
splendidly 
when, 
in 
analyzing 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
Commune, 
he 
said 
that 
the 
oppressed 
are 
allowed 
once 
every 
few 
years 
to 
decide 
which 
particular 
representatives 
of 
the 
oppressing 
class 
shall 
represent 
and 
repress 
them 
in 
parliament! 


But 
from 
this 
capitalist 
democracy-that 
is 
inevitably 
narrow 
and 
stealthily 
pushes 
aside 
the 
poor, 
and 
is 
therefore 
hypocritical 
and 
false 
through 
and 
through-forward 
development 
does 
not 
proceed 
simply, 
directly 
and 
smoothly, 
towards 
"greater 
and 
greater 
democracy", 
as 
the 
liberal 
professors 
and 
petty-bourgeois 
opportunists 
would 
have 
us 
believe. 
No, 
forward 
development, 
i.e., 
development 
towards 
communism, 
proceeds 
through 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
and 
cannot 
do 
otherwise, 
for 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
capitalist 
exploiters 
cannot 
be 
broken 
by 
anyone 
else 
or 
in 
any 
other 
way. 


And 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
i.e., 
the 
organization 
of 
the 
vanguard 
of 
the 
oppressed 
as 
the 
ruling 
class 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
suppressing 
the 
oppressors, 
cannot 
result 
merely 
in 
an 
expansion 
of 
democracy. 
Simultaneously 
with 
an 
immense 
expansion 
of 
democracy, 
which 
for 
the 
first 
time 
becomes 
democracy 
for 
the 
poor, 
democracy 
for 
the 
people, 
and 
not 
democracy 
for 
the 
money-bags, 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat 
imposes 
a 
series 
of 
restrictions 
on 
the 
freedom 
of 
the 
oppressors, 
the 
exploiters, 
the 
capitalists. 
We 
must 
suppress 
them 
in 
order 
to 
free 
humanity 
from 
wage 
slavery, 
their 
resistance 
must 
be 
crushed 
by 
force; 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
there 
is 
no 
freedom 
and 
no 
democracy 
where 
there 
is 
suppression 
and 
where 
there 
is 
violence. 


Engels 
expressed 
this 
splendidly 
in 
his 
letter 
to 
Bebel 
when 
he 
said, 
as 
the 
reader 
will 
remember, 
that 
"the 
proletariat 
needs 
the 
state, 
not 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
freedom 
but 
in 
order 
to 
hold 
down 
its 
adversaries, 
and 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
becomes 
possible 
to 
speak 
of 
freedom 
the 
state 
as 
such 
ceases 
to 
exist". 


Democracy 
for 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
the 
people, 
and 
suppression 
by 
force, 
i.e., 
exclusion 
from 
democracy, 
of 
the 
exploiters 
and 
oppressors 
of 
the 
people-this 
is 
the 
change 
democracy 
undergoes 
during 
the 
transition 
from 
capitalism 
to 
communism. 


Only 
in 
communist 
society, 
when 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
capitalists 
have 
disappeared, 
when 
there 
are 
no 
classes 
(i.e., 
when 
there 
is 
no 
distinction 
between 
the 
members 
of 
society 
as 
regards 
their 
relation 
to 
the 
social 
means 
of 
production), 
only 
then 
"the 
state… 
ceases 
to 
exist", 
and 
"it 
becomes 
possible 
to 
speak 
of 
freedom". 
Only 
then 
will 
a 
truly 
complete 
democracy 
become 
possible 
and 
be 
realized, 
a 
democracy 
without 
any 
exceptions 



whatever. 
And 
only 
then 
will 
democracy 
begin 
to 
wither 
away, 
owing 
to 
the 
simple 
fact 
that, 
freed 
from 
capitalist 
slavery, 
from 
the 
untold 
horrors, 
savagery, 
absurdities, 
and 
infamies 
of 
capitalist 
exploitation, 
people 
will 
gradually 
become 
accustomed 
to 
observing 
the 
elementary 
rules 
of 
social 
intercourse 
that 
have 
been 
known 
for 
centuries 
and 
repeated 
for 
thousands 
of 
years 
in 
all 
copy-book 
maxims. 
They 
will 
become 
accustomed 
to 
observing 
them 
without 
force, 
without 
coercion, 
without 
subordination, 
without 
the 
special 
apparatus 
for 
coercion 
called 
the 
state. 


The 
expression 
"the 
state 
withers 
away" 
is 
very 
well-chosen, 
for 
it 
indicates 
both 
the 
gradual 
and 
the 
spontaneous 
nature 
of 
the 
process. 
Only 
habit 
can, 
and 
undoubtedly 
will, 
have 
such 
an 
effect; 
for 
we 
see 
around 
us 
on 
millions 
of 
occassions 
how 
readily 
people 
become 
accustomed 
to 
observing 
the 
necessary 
rules 
of 
social 
intercourse 
when 
there 
is 
no 
exploitation, 
when 
there 
is 
nothing 
that 
arouses 
indignation, 
evokes 
protest 
and 
revolt, 
and 
creates 
the 
need 
for 
suppression. 


And 
so 
in 
capitalist 
society 
we 
have 
a 
democracy 
that 
is 
curtailed, 
wretched, 
false, 
a 
democracy 
only 
for 
the 
rich, 
for 
the 
minority. 
The 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
the 
period 
of 
transition 
to 
communism, 
will 
for 
the 
first 
time 
create 
democracy 
for 
the 
people, 
for 
the 
majority, 
along 
with 
the 
necessary 
suppression 
of 
the 
exploiters, 
of 
the 
minority. 
Communism 
alone 
is 
capable 
of 
providing 
really 
complete 
democracy, 
and 
the 
more 
complete 
it 
is, 
the 
sooner 
it 
will 
become 
unnecessary 
and 
wither 
away 
of 
its 
own 
accord. 


In 
other 
words, 
under 
capitalism 
we 
have 
the 
state 
in 
the 
proper 
sense 
of 
the 
word, 
that 
is, 
a 
special 
machine 
for 
the 
suppression 
of 
one 
class 
by 
another, 
and, 
what 
is 
more, 
of 
the 
majority 
by 
the 
minority. 
Naturally, 
to 
be 
successful, 
such 
an 
undertaking 
as 
the 
systematic 
suppression 
of 
the 
exploited 
majority 
by 
the 
exploiting 
minority 
calls 
for 
the 
utmost 
ferocity 
and 
savagery 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
suppressing, 
it 
calls 
for 
seas 
of 
blood, 
through 
which 
mankind 
is 
actually 
wading 
its 
way 
in 
slavery, 
serfdom 
and 
wage 
labor. 


Furthermore, 
during 
the 
transition 
from 
capitalism 
to 
communism 
suppression 
is 
still 
necessary, 
but 
it 
is 
now 
the 
suppression 
of 
the 
exploiting 
minority 
by 
the 
exploited 
majority. 
A 
special 
apparatus, 
a 
special 
machine 
for 
suppression, 
the 
“state”, 
is 
still 
necessary, 
but 
this 
is 
now 
a 
transitional 
state. 
It 
is 
no 
longer 
a 
state 
in 
the 
proper 
sense 
of 
the 
word; 
for 
the 
suppression 
of 
the 
minority 
of 
exploiters 
by 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
wage 
slaves 
of 
yesterday 
is 
comparatively 
so 
easy, 
simple 
and 
natural 
a 
task 
that 
it 
will 
entail 
far 
less 
bloodshed 
than 
the 
suppression 
of 
the 
risings 
of 
slaves, 
serfs 
or 
wage



laborers, 
and 
it 
will 
cost 
mankind 
far 
less. 
And 
it 
is 
compatible 
with 
the 
extension 
of 
democracy 
to 
such 
an 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
the 
population 
that 
the 
need 
for 
a 
special 
machine 
of 
suppression 
will 
begin 
to 
disappear. 
Naturally, 
the 
exploiters 
are 
unable 
to 
suppress 
the 
people 
without 
a 
highly 
complex 
machine 
for 
performing 
this 
task, 
but 
the 
people 
can 
suppress 
the 
exploiters 
even 
with 
a 
very 
simple 
“machine”, 
almost 
without 
a 
“machine”, 
without 
a 
special 
apparatus, 
by 
the 
simple 
organization 
of 
the 
armed 
people 
(such 
as 
the 
Soviets 
of 
Workers' 
and 
Soldiers' 
Deputies, 
we 
would 
remark, 
running 
ahead). 


Lastly, 
only 
communism 
makes 
the 
state 
absolutely 
unnecessary, 
for 
there 
is 
nobody 
to 
be 
suppressed-“nobody” 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
a 
class, 
of 
a 
systematic 
struggle 
against 
a 
definite 
section 
of 
the 
population. 
We 
are 
not 
utopians, 
and 
do 
not 
in 
the 
least 
deny 
the 
possibility 
and 
inevitability 
of 
excesses 
on 
the 
part 
of 
individual 
persons, 
or 
the 
need 
to 
stop 
such 
excesses. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
however, 
no 
special 
machine, 
no 
special 
apparatus 
of 
suppression, 
is 
needed 
for 
this: 
this 
will 
be 
done 
by 
the 
armed 
people 
themselves, 
as 
simply 
and 
as 
readily 
as 
any 
crowd 
of 
civilized 
people, 
even 
in 
modern 
society, 
interferes 
to 
put 
a 
stop 
to 
a 
scuffle 
or 
to 
prevent 
a 
woman 
from 
being 
assaulted. 
And, 
secondly, 
we 
know 
that 
the 
fundamental 
social 
cause 
of 
excesses, 
which 
consist 
in 
the 
violation 
of 
the 
rules 
of 
social 
intercourse, 
is 
the 
exploitation 
of 
the 
people, 
their 
want 
and 
their 
poverty. 
With 
the 
removal 
of 
this 
chief 
cause, 
excesses 
will 
inevitably 
begin 
to 
"wither 
away". 
We 
do 
not 
know 
how 
quickly 
and 
in 
what 
succession, 
but 
we 
do 
know 
they 
will 
wither 
away. 
With 
their 
withering 
away 
the 
state 
will 
also 
wither 
away. 


Without 
building 
utopias, 
Marx 
defined 
more 
fully 
what 
can 
be 
defined 
now 
regarding 
this 
future, 
namely, 
the 
differences 
between 
the 
lower 
and 
higher 
phases 
(levels, 
stages) 
of 
communist 
society. 



3. 
The 
First 
Phase 
of 
Communist 
Society 
In 
the 
Critique 
of 
the 
Gotha 
Programme, 
Marx 
goes 
into 
detail 
to 
disprove 
Lassalle's 
idea 
that 
under 
socialism 
the 
worker 
will 
receive 
the 
“undiminished” 
or 
"full 
product 
of 
his 
labor". 
Marx 
shows 
that 
from 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
social 
labor 
of 
society 
there 
must 
be 
deducted 
a 
reserve 
fund, 
a 
fund 
for 
the 
expansion 
of 
production, 
a 
fund 
for 
the 
replacement 
of 
the 
"wear 
and 
tear" 
of 
machinery, 
and 
so 
on. 
Then, 
from 
the 
means 
of 
consumption 
must 
be 
deducted 
a 
fund 
for 
administrative 
expenses, 
for 
schools, 
hospitals, 
old 
people's 
homes, 
and 
so 
on. 


Instead 
of 
Lassalle's 
hazy, 
obscure, 
general 
phrase 
("the 
full 
product 
of 
his 
labor 
to 
the 
worker"), 
Marx 
makes 
a 
sober 
estimate 
of 
exactly 
how 
socialist 
society 
will 
have 
to 
manage 
its 
affairs. 
Marx 
proceeds 
to 
make 
a 
concrete 
analysis 
of 
the 
conditions 
of 
life 
of 
a 
society 
in 
which 
there 
will 
be 
no 
capitalism, 
and 
says: 


"What 
we 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
here[29] 
is 
a 
communist 
society, 
not 
as 
it 
has 
developed 
on 
its 
own 
foundations, 
but, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
just 
as 
it 
emerges 
from 
capitalist 
society; 
which 
is 
thus 
in 
every 
respect, 
economically, 
morally, 
and 
intellectually, 
still 
stamped 
with 
the 
birthmarks 
of 
the 
old 
society 
from 
whose 
womb 
it 
comes." 


It 
is 
this 
communist 
society, 
which 
has 
just 
emerged 
into 
the 
light 
of 
day 
out 
of 
the 
womb 
of 
capitalism 
and 
which 
is 
in 
every 
respect 
stamped 
with 
the 
birthmarks 
of 
the 
old 
society, 
that 
Marx 
terms 
the 
“first”, 
or 
lower, 
phase 
of 
communist 
society. 


The 
means 
of 
production 
are 
no 
longer 
the 
private 
property 
of 
individuals. 
The 
means 
of 
production 
belong 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
society. 
Every 
member 
of 
society, 
performing 
a 
certain 
part 
of 
the 
socially-necessary 
work, 
receives 
a 
certificate 
from 
society 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
he 
has 
done 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
work. 
And 
with 
this 
certificate 
he 
receives 
from 
the 
public 
store 
of 
consumer 
goods 
a 
corresponding 
quantity 
of 
products. 
After 
a 
deduction 
is 
made 
of 
the 
amount 
of 
labor 
which 
goes 
to 
the 
public 
fund, 
every 
worker, 
therefore, 
receives 
from 
society 
as 
much 
as 
he 
has 
given 
to 
it. 


“Equality” 
apparently 
reigns 
supreme. 


But 
when 
Lassalle, 
having 
in 
view 
such 
a 
social 
order 
(usually 
called 
socialism, 
but 
termed 
by 
Marx 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
communism), 
says 
that 
this 
is 
"equitable 
distribution", 
that 
this 
is 
"the 
equal 
right 
of 
all 
to 
an 
equal 



product 
of 
labor", 
Lassalle 
is 
mistaken 
and 
Marx 
exposes 
the 
mistake. 


"Hence, 
the 
equal 
right," 
says 
Marx, 
in 
this 
case 
still 
certainly 
conforms 
to 
"bourgeois 
law", 
which,like 
all 
law, 
implies 
inequality. 
All 
law 
is 
an 
application 
of 
an 
equal 
measure 
to 
different 
people 
who 
in 
fact 
are 
not 
alike, 
are 
not 
equal 
to 
one 
another. 
That 
is 
why 
the 
"equal 
right" 
is 
violation 
of 
equality 
and 
an 
injustice. 
In 
fact, 
everyone, 
having 
performed 
as 
much 
social 
labor 
as 
another, 
receives 
an 
equal 
share 
of 
the 
social 
product 
(after 
the 
above-mentioned 
deductions). 


But 
people 
are 
not 
alike: 
one 
is 
strong, 
another 
is 
weak; 
one 
is 
married, 
another 
is 
not; 
one 
has 
more 
children, 
another 
has 
less, 
and 
so 
on. 
And 
the 
conclusion 
Marx 
draws 
is: 


"… 
With 
an 
equal 
performance 
of 
labor, 
and 
hence 
an 
equal 
share 
in 
the 
social 
consumption 
fund, 
one 
will 
in 
fact 
receive 
more 
than 
another, 
one 
will 
be 
richer 
than 
another, 
and 
so 
on. 
To 
avoid 
all 
these 
defects, 
the 
right 
instead 
of 
being 
equal 
would 
have 
to 
be 
unequal." 


The 
first 
phase 
of 
communism, 
therefore, 
cannot 
yet 
provide 
justice 
and 
equality; 
differences, 
and 
unjust 
differences, 
in 
wealth 
will 
still 
persist, 
but 
the 
exploitation 
of 
man 
by 
man 
will 
have 
become 
impossible 
because 
it 
will 
be 
impossible 
to 
seize 
the 
means 
of 
production-the 
factories, 
machines, 
land, 
etc.-and 
make 
them 
private 
property. 
In 
smashing 
Lassalle's 
petty-bourgeois, 
vague 
phrases 
about 
“equality” 
and 
“justice” 
in 
general, 
Marx 
shows 
the 
course 
of 
development 
of 
communist 
society, 
which 
is 
compelled 
to 
abolish 
at 
first 
only 
the 
“injustice” 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
seized 
by 
individuals, 
and 
which 
is 
unable 
at 
once 
to 
eliminate 
the 
other 
injustice, 
which 
consists 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
consumer 
goods 
"according 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
labor 
performed" 
(and 
not 
according 
to 
needs). 


The 
vulgar 
economists, 
including 
the 
bourgeois 
professors 
and 
“our” 
Tugan, 
constantly 
reproach 
the 
socialists 
with 
forgetting 
the 
inequality 
of 
people 
and 
with 
“dreaming” 
of 
eliminating 
this 
inequality. 
Such 
a 
reproach, 
as 
we 
see, 
only 
proves 
the 
extreme 
ignorance 
of 
the 
bourgeois 
ideologists. 


Marx 
not 
only 
most 
scrupulously 
takes 
account 
of 
the 
inevitable 
inequality 
of 
men, 
but 
he 
also 
takes 
into 
account 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
mere 
conversion 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
into 
the 
common 
property 
of 
the 
whole 
society 
(commonly 
called 
“socialism”) 
does 
not 
remove 
the 
defects 
of 
distribution 
and 
the 
inequality 
of 
"bourgeois 
laws" 
which 
continues 
to 
prevail 
so 
long 
as 
products 
are 
divided 
"according 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
labor 
performed". 
Continuing, 
Marx 
says: 



"But 
these 
defects 
are 
inevitable 
in 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
communist 
society 
as 
it 
is 
when 
it 
has 
just 
emerged, 
after 
prolonged 
birth 
pangs, 
from 
capitalist 
society. 
Law 
can 
never 
be 
higher 
than 
the 
economic 
structure 
of 
society 
and 
its 
cultural 
development 
conditioned 
thereby." 


And 
so, 
in 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
communist 
society 
(usually 
called 
socialism) 
"bourgeois 
law" 
is 
not 
abolished 
in 
its 
entirety, 
but 
only 
in 
part, 
only 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
economic 
revolution 
so 
far 
attained, 
i.e., 
only 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
"Bourgeois 
law" 
recognizes 
them 
as 
the 
private 
property 
of 
individuals. 
Socialism 
converts 
them 
into 
common 
property. 
To 
that 
extent-and 
to 
that 
extent 
alone-"bourgeois 
law" 
disappears. 


However, 
it 
persists 
as 
far 
as 
its 
other 
part 
is 
concerned; 
it 
persists 
in 
the 
capacity 
of 
regulator 
(determining 
factor) 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
products 
and 
the 
allotment 
of 
labor 
among 
the 
members 
of 
society. 
The 
socialist 
principle, 
"He 
who 
does 
not 
work 
shall 
not 
eat", 
is 
already 
realized; 
the 
other 
socialist 
principle, 
"An 
equal 
amount 
of 
products 
for 
an 
equal 
amount 
of 
labor", 
is 
also 
already 
realized. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
yet 
communism, 
and 
it 
does 
not 
yet 
abolish 
"bourgeois 
law", 
which 
gives 
unequal 
individuals, 
in 
return 
for 
unequal 
(really 
unequal) 
amounts 
of 
labor, 
equal 
amounts 
of 
products. 


This 
is 
a 
“defect”, 
says 
Marx, 
but 
it 
is 
unavoidable 
in 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
communism; 
for 
if 
we 
are 
not 
to 
indulge 
in 
utopianism, 
we 
must 
not 
think 
that 
having 
overthrown 
capitalism 
people 
will 
at 
once 
learn 
to 
work 
for 
society 
without 
any 
rules 
of 
law. 
Besides, 
the 
abolition 
of 
capitalism 
does 
not 
immediately 
create 
the 
economic 
prerequisites 
for 
such 
a 
change. 


Now, 
there 
are 
no 
other 
rules 
than 
those 
of 
"bourgeois 
law". 
To 
this 
extent, 
therefore, 
there 
still 
remains 
the 
need 
for 
a 
state, 
which, 
while 
safeguarding 
the 
common 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
would 
safeguard 
equality 
in 
labor 
and 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
products. 


The 
state 
withers 
away 
insofar 
as 
there 
are 
no 
longer 
any 
capitalists, 
any 
classes, 
and, 
consequently, 
no 
class 
can 
be 
suppressed. 


But 
the 
state 
has 
not 
yet 
completely 
withered 
away, 
since 
the 
still 
remains 
the 
safeguarding 
of 
"bourgeois 
law", 
which 
sanctifies 
actual 
inequality. 
For 
the 
state 
to 
wither 
away 
completely, 
complete 
communism 
is 
necessary. 



4. 
The 
Higher 
Phase 
of 
Communist 
Society 
Marx 
continues: 


"In 
a 
higher 
phase 
of 
communist 
society, 
after 
the 
enslaving 
subordination 
of 
the 
individual 
to 
the 
division 
of 
labor, 
and 
with 
it 
also 
the 
antithesis 
between 
mental 
and 
physical 
labor, 
has 
vanished, 
after 
labor 
has 
become 
not 
only 
a 
livelihood 
but 
life's 
prime 
want, 
after 
the 
productive 
forces 
have 
increased 
with 
the 
all-round 
development 
of 
the 
individual, 
and 
all 
the 
springs 
of 
co-operative 
wealth 
flow 
more 
abundantly-only 
then 
can 
the 
narrow 
horizon 
of 
bourgeois 
law 
be 
left 
behind 
in 
its 
entirety 
and 
society 
inscribe 
on 
its 
banners: 
From 
each 
according 
to 
his 
ability, 
to 
each 
according 
to 
his 
needs!" 


Only 
now 
can 
we 
fully 
appreciate 
the 
correctness 
of 
Engels' 
remarks 
mercilessly 
ridiculing 
the 
absurdity 
of 
combining 
the 
words 
“freedom” 
and 
“state”. 
So 
long 
as 
the 
state 
exists 
there 
is 
no 
freedom. 
When 
there 
is 
freedom, 
there 
will 
be 
no 
state. 


The 
economic 
basis 
for 
the 
complete 
withering 
away 
of 
the 
state 
is 
such 
a 
high 
state 
of 
development 
of 
communism 
at 
which 
the 
antithesis 
between 
mental 
and 
physical 
labor 
disappears, 
at 
which 
there 
consequently 
disappears 
one 
of 
the 
principal 
sources 
of 
modern 
social 
inequality-a 
source, 
moreover, 
which 
cannot 
on 
any 
account 
be 
removed 
immediately 
by 
the 
mere 
conversion 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
into 
public 
property, 
by 
the 
mere 
expropriation 
of 
the 
capitalists. 


This 
expropriation 
will 
make 
it 
possible 
for 
the 
productive 
forces 
to 
develop 
to 
a 
tremendous 
extent. 
And 
when 
we 
see 
how 
incredibly 
capitalism 
is 
already 
retarding 
this 
development, 
when 
we 
see 
how 
much 
progress 
could 
be 
achieved 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
level 
of 
technique 
already 
attained, 
we 
are 
entitled 
to 
say 
with 
the 
fullest 
confidence 
that 
the 
expropriation 
of 
the 
capitalists 
will 
inevitably 
result 
in 
an 
enormous 
development 
of 
the 
productive 
forces 
of 
human 
society. 
But 
how 
rapidly 
this 
development 
will 
proceed, 
how 
soon 
it 
will 
reach 
the 
point 
of 
breaking 
away 
from 
the 
division 
of 
labor, 
of 
doing 
away 
with 
the 
antithesis 
between 
mental 
and 
physical 
labor, 
of 
transforming 
labor 
into 
"life's 
prime 
want"-we 
do 
not 
and 
cannot 
know. 


That 
is 
why 
we 
are 
entitled 
to 
speak 
only 
of 
the 
inevitable 
withering 
away 
of 
the 
state, 
emphasizing 
the 
protracted 
nature 
of 
this 
process 
and 
its 



dependence 
upon 
the 
rapidity 
of 
development 
of 
the 
higher 
phase 
of 
communism, 
and 
leaving 
the 
question 
of 
the 
time 
required 
for, 
or 
the 
concrete 
forms 
of, 
the 
withering 
away 
quite 
open, 
because 
there 
is 
no 
material 
for 
answering 
these 
questions. 


The 
state 
will 
be 
able 
to 
wither 
away 
completely 
when 
society 
adopts 
the 
rule: 
"From 
each 
according 
to 
his 
ability, 
to 
each 
according 
to 
his 
needs", 
i.e., 
when 
people 
have 
become 
so 
accustomed 
to 
observing 
the 
fundamental 
rules 
of 
social 
intercourse 
and 
when 
their 
labor 
has 
become 
so 
productive 
that 
they 
will 
voluntarily 
work 
according 
to 
their 
ability. 
"The 
narrow 
horizon 
of 
bourgeois 
law", 
which 
compels 
one 
to 
calculate 
with 
the 
heartlessness 
of 
a 
Shylock 
whether 
one 
has 
not 
worked 
half 
an 
hour 
more 
than 
anybody 
else-
this 
narrow 
horizon 
will 
then 
be 
left 
behind. 
There 
will 
then 
be 
no 
need 
for 
society, 
in 
distributing 
the 
products, 
to 
regulate 
the 
quantity 
to 
be 
received 
by 
each; 
each 
will 
take 
freely 
"according 
to 
his 
needs". 


From 
the 
bourgeois 
point 
of 
view, 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
declare 
that 
such 
a 
social 
order 
is 
"sheer 
utopia" 
and 
to 
sneer 
at 
the 
socialists 
for 
promising 
everyone 
the 
right 
to 
receive 
from 
society, 
without 
any 
control 
over 
the 
labor 
of 
the 
individual 
citizen, 
any 
quantity 
of 
truffles, 
cars, 
pianos, 
etc. 
Even 
to 
this 
day, 
most 
bourgeois 
“savants” 
confine 
themselves 
to 
sneering 
in 
this 
way, 
thereby 
betraying 
both 
their 
ignorance 
and 
their 
selfish 
defence 
of 
capitalism. 


Ignorance-for 
it 
has 
never 
entered 
the 
head 
of 
any 
socialist 
to 
“promise” 
that 
the 
higher 
phase 
of 
the 
development 
of 
communism 
will 
arrive; 
as 
for 
the 
greatest 
socialists' 
forecast 
that 
it 
will 
arrive, 
it 
presupposes 
not 
the 
present 
ordinary 
run 
of 
people, 
who, 
like 
the 
seminary 
students 
in 
Pomyalovsky's 
stories, 
are 
capable 
of 
damaging 
the 
stocks 
of 
public 
wealth 
"just 
for 
fun", 
and 
of 
demanding 
the 
impossible. 


Until 
the 
“higher” 
phase 
of 
communism 
arrives, 
the 
socialists 
demand 
the 
strictest 
control 
by 
society 
and 
by 
the 
state 
over 
the 
measure 
of 
labor 
and 
the 
measure 
of 
consumption; 
but 
this 
control 
must 
start 
with 
the 
expropriation 
of 
the 
capitalists, 
with 
the 
establishment 
of 
workers' 
control 
over 
the 
capitalists, 
and 
must 
be 
exercised 
not 
by 
a 
state 
of 
bureaucrats, 
but 
by 
a 
state 
of 
armed 
workers. 


The 
selfish 
defence 
of 
capitalism 
by 
the 
bourgeois 
ideologists 
(and 
their 
hangers-on, 
like 
the 
Tseretelis, 
Chernovs, 
and 
Co.) 
consists 
in 
that 
they 
substitute 
arguing 
and 
talk 
about 
the 
distant 
future 
for 
the 
vital 
and 
burning 
question 
of 
present-day 
politics, 
namely, 
the 
expropriation 
of 
the 
capitalists, 
the 
conversion 
of 
all 
citizens 
into 
workers 
and 
other 
employees 
of 
one 
huge 



“syndicate”-the 
whole 
state-and 
the 
complete 
subordination 
of 
the 
entire 
work 
of 
this 
syndicate 
to 
a 
genuinely 
democratic 
state, 
the 
state 
of 
the 
Soviets 
of 
Workers' 
and 
Soldiers' 
Deputies. 


In 
fact, 
when 
a 
learned 
professor, 
followed 
by 
the 
philistine, 
followed 
in 
turn 
by 
the 
Tseretelis 
and 
Chernovs, 
talks 
of 
wild 
utopias, 
of 
the 
demagogic 
promises 
of 
the 
Bolsheviks, 
of 
the 
impossibility 
of 
“introducing” 
socialism, 
it 
is 
the 
higher 
stage, 
or 
phase, 
of 
communism 
he 
has 
in 
mind, 
which 
no 
one 
has 
ever 
promised 
or 
even 
thought 
to 
“introduce”, 
because, 
generally 
speaking, 
it 
cannot 
be 
“introduced”. 


And 
this 
brings 
us 
to 
the 
question 
of 
the 
scientific 
distinction 
between 
socialism 
and 
communism 
which 
Engels 
touched 
on 
in 
his 
above-quoted 
argument 
about 
the 
incorrectness 
of 
the 
name 
"Social-Democrat". 
Politically, 
the 
distinction 
between 
the 
first, 
or 
lower, 
and 
the 
higher 
phase 
of 
communism 
will 
in 
time, 
probably, 
be 
tremendous. 
But 
it 
would 
be 
ridiculous 
to 
recognize 
this 
distinction 
now, 
under 
capitalism, 
and 
only 
individual 
anarchists, 
perhaps, 
could 
invest 
it 
with 
primary 
importance 
(if 
there 
still 
are 
people 
among 
the 
anarchists 
who 
have 
learned 
nothing 
from 
the 
“Plekhanov” 
conversion 
of 
the 
Kropotkins, 
of 
Grave, 
Corneliseen, 
and 
other 
“stars” 
of 
anarchism 
into 
social-chauvinists 
or 
"anarcho-trenchists", 
as 
Ghe, 
one 
of 
the 
few 
anarchists 
who 
have 
still 
preserved 
a 
sense 
of 
humor 
and 
a 
conscience, 
has 
put 
it). 


But 
the 
scientific 
distinction 
between 
socialism 
and 
communism 
is 
clear. 
What 
is 
usually 
called 
socialism 
was 
termed 
by 
Marx 
the 
“first”, 
or 
lower, 
phase 
of 
communist 
society. 
Insofar 
as 
the 
means 
of 
production 
becomes 
common 
property, 
the 
word 
“communism” 
is 
also 
applicable 
here, 
providing 
we 
do 
not 
forget 
that 
this 
is 
not 
complete 
communism. 
The 
great 
significance 
of 
Marx's 
explanations 
is 
that 
here, 
too, 
he 
consistently 
applies 
materialist 
dialectics, 
the 
theory 
of 
development, 
and 
regards 
communism 
as 
something 
which 
develops 
out 
of 
capitalism. 
Instead 
of 
scholastically 
invented, 
“concocted” 
definitions 
and 
fruitless 
disputes 
over 
words 
(What 
is 
socialism? 
What 
is 
communism?), 
Marx 
gives 
an 
analysis 
of 
what 
might 
be 
called 
the 
stages 
of 
the 
economic 
maturity 
of 
communism. 


In 
its 
first 
phase, 
or 
first 
stage, 
communism 
cannot 
as 
yet 
be 
fully 
mature 
economically 
and 
entirely 
free 
from 
traditions 
or 
vestiges 
of 
capitalism. 
Hence 
the 
interesting 
phenomenon 
that 
communism 
in 
its 
first 
phase 
retains 
"the 
narrow 
horizon 
of 
bourgeois 
law". 
Of 
course, 
bourgeois 
law 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
distribution 
of 
consumer 
goods 
inevitably 
presupposes 
the 
existence 
of 



the 
bourgeois 
state, 
for 
law 
is 
nothing 
without 
an 
apparatus 
capable 
of 
enforcing 
the 
observance 
of 
the 
rules 
of 
law. 


It 
follows 
that 
under 
communism 
there 
remains 
for 
a 
time 
not 
only 
bourgeois 
law, 
but 
even 
the 
bourgeois 
state, 
without 
the 
bourgeoisie! 


This 
may 
sound 
like 
a 
paradox 
or 
simply 
a 
dialectical 
conundrum 
of 
which 
Marxism 
is 
often 
accused 
by 
people 
who 
have 
not 
taken 
the 
slightest 
trouble 
to 
study 
its 
extraordinarily 
profound 
content. 


But 
in 
fact, 
remnants 
of 
the 
old, 
surviving 
in 
the 
new, 
confront 
us 
in 
life 
at 
every 
step, 
both 
in 
nature 
and 
in 
society. 
And 
Marx 
did 
not 
arbitrarily 
insert 
a 
scrap 
of 
“bourgeois” 
law 
into 
communism, 
but 
indicated 
what 
is 
economically 
and 
politically 
inevitable 
in 
a 
society 
emerging 
out 
of 
the 
womb 
of 
capitalism. 


Democracy 
means 
equality. 
The 
great 
significance 
of 
the 
proletariat's 
struggle 
for 
equality 
and 
of 
equality 
as 
a 
slogan 
will 
be 
clear 
if 
we 
correctly 
interpret 
it 
as 
meaning 
the 
abolition 
of 
classes. 
But 
democracy 
means 
only 
formal 
equality. 
And 
as 
soon 
as 
equality 
is 
achieved 
for 
all 
members 
of 
society 
in 
relation 
to 
ownership 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
that 
is, 
equality 
of 
labor 
and 
wages, 
humanity 
will 
inevitably 
be 
confronted 
with 
the 
question 
of 
advancing 
further 
from 
formal 
equality 
to 
actual 
equality, 
i.e., 
to 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
rule 
"from 
each 
according 
to 
his 
ability, 
to 
each 
according 
to 
his 
needs". 
By 
what 
stages, 
by 
means 
of 
what 
practical 
measures 
humanity 
will 
proceed 
to 
this 
supreme 
aim 
we 
do 
not 
and 
cannot 
know. 
But 
it 
is 
important 
to 
realize 
how 
infinitely 
mendacious 
is 
the 
ordinary 
bourgeois 
conception 
of 
socialism 
as 
something 
lifeless, 
rigid, 
fixed 
once 
and 
for 
all, 
whereas 
in 
reality 
only 
socialism 
will 
be 
the 
beginning 
of 
a 
rapid, 
genuine, 
truly 
mass 
forward 
movement, 
embracing 
first 
the 
majority 
and 
then 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
population, 
in 
all 
spheres 
of 
public 
and 
private 
life. 


Democracy 
is 
of 
enormous 
importance 
to 
the 
working 
class 
in 
its 
struggle 
against 
the 
capitalists 
for 
its 
emancipation. 
But 
democracy 
is 
by 
no 
means 
a 
boundary 
not 
to 
be 
overstepped; 
it 
is 
only 
one 
of 
the 
stages 
on 
the 
road 
from 
feudalism 
to 
capitalism, 
and 
from 
capitalism 
to 
communism. 


Democracy 
is 
a 
form 
of 
the 
state, 
it 
represents, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
the 
organized, 
systematic 
use 
of 
force 
against 
persons; 
but, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
signifies 
the 
formal 
recognition 
of 
equality 
of 
citizens, 
the 
equal 
right 
of 
all 
to 
determine 
the 
structure 
of, 
and 
to 
administer, 
the 
state. 
This, 
in 
turn, 
results 
in 
the 
fact 
that, 
at 
a 
certain 
stage 
in 
the 
development 
of 
democracy, 
it 
first 
welds 
together 
the 
class 
that 
wages 
a 
revolutionary 
struggle 
against 
capitalism-the 



proletariat, 
and 
enables 
it 
to 
crush, 
smash 
to 
atoms, 
wipe 
off 
the 
face 
of 
the 
earth 
the 
bourgeois, 
even 
the 
republican-bourgeois, 
state 
machine, 
the 
standing 
army, 
the 
police 
and 
the 
bureaucracy 
and 
to 
substitute 
for 
them 
a 
more 
democratic 
state 
machine, 
but 
a 
state 
machine 
nevertheless, 
in 
the 
shape 
of 
armed 
workers 
who 
proceed 
to 
form 
a 
militia 
involving 
the 
entire 
population. 


Here 
"quantity 
turns 
into 
quality": 
such 
a 
degree 
of 
democracy 
implies 
overstepping 
the 
boundaries 
of 
bourgeois 
society 
and 
beginning 
its 
socialist 
reorganization. 
If 
really 
all 
take 
part 
in 
the 
administration 
of 
the 
state, 
capitalism 
cannot 
retain 
its 
hold. 
The 
development 
of 
capitalism, 
in 
turn, 
creates 
the 
preconditions 
that 
enable 
really 
“all” 
to 
take 
part 
in 
the 
administration 
of 
the 
state. 
Some 
of 
these 
preconditions 
are: 
universal 
literacy, 
which 
has 
already 
been 
achieved 
in 
a 
number 
of 
the 
most 
advanced 
capitalist 
countries, 
then 
the 
"training 
and 
disciplining" 
of 
millions 
of 
workers 
by 
the 
huge, 
complex, 
socialized 
apparatus 
of 
the 
postal 
service, 
railways, 
big 
factories, 
large-scale 
commerce, 
banking, 
etc., 
etc. 


Given 
these 
economic 
preconditions, 
it 
is 
quite 
possible, 
after 
the 
overthrow 
of 
the 
capitalists 
and 
the 
bureaucrats, 
to 
proceed 
immediately, 
overnight, 
to 
replace 
them 
in 
the 
control 
over 
production 
and 
distribution, 
in 
the 
work 
of 
keeping 
account 
of 
labor 
and 
products, 
by 
the 
armed 
workers, 
by 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
armed 
population. 
(The 
question 
of 
control 
and 
accounting 
should 
not 
be 
confused 
with 
the 
question 
of 
the 
scientifically 
trained 
staff 
of 
engineers, 
agronomists, 
and 
so 
on. 
These 
gentlemen 
are 
working 
today 
in 
obedience 
to 
the 
wishes 
of 
the 
capitalists 
and 
will 
work 
even 
better 
tomorrow 
in 
obedience 
to 
the 
wishes 
of 
the 
armed 
workers.) 


Accounting 
and 
control-that 
is 
mainly 
what 
is 
needed 
for 
the 
"smooth 
working", 
for 
the 
proper 
functioning, 
of 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
communist 
society. 
All 
citizens 
are 
transformed 
into 
hired 
employees 
of 
the 
state, 
which 
consists 
of 
the 
armed 
workers. 
All 
citizens 
becomes 
employees 
and 
workers 
of 
a 
single 
countrywide 
state 
“syndicate”. 
All 
that 
is 
required 
is 
that 
they 
should 
work 
equally, 
do 
their 
proper 
share 
of 
work, 
and 
get 
equal 
pay; 
the 
accounting 
and 
control 
necessary 
for 
this 
have 
been 
simplified 
by 
capitalism 
to 
the 
utmost 
and 
reduced 
to 
the 
extraordinarily 
simple 
operations-which 
any 
literate 
person 
can 
perform-of 
supervising 
and 
recording, 
knowledge 
of 
the 
four 
rules 
of 
arithmetic, 
and 
issuing 
appropriate 
receipts. 


When 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
people 
begin 
independently 
and 
everywhere 
to 
keep 
such 
accounts 
and 
exercise 
such 
control 
over 
the 
capitalists 
(now 



converted 
into 
employees) 
and 
over 
the 
intellectual 
gentry 
who 
preserve 
their 
capitalist 
habits, 
this 
control 
will 
really 
become 
universal, 
general, 
and 
popular; 
and 
there 
will 
be 
no 
getting 
away 
from 
it, 
there 
will 
be 
"nowhere 
to 
go". 


The 
whole 
of 
society 
will 
have 
become 
a 
single 
office 
and 
a 
single 
factory, 
with 
equality 
of 
labor 
and 
pay. 


But 
this 
“factory” 
discipline, 
which 
the 
proletariat, 
after 
defeating 
the 
capitalists, 
after 
overthrowing 
the 
exploiters, 
will 
extend 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
society, 
is 
by 
no 
means 
our 
ideal, 
or 
our 
ultimate 
goal. 
It 
is 
only 
a 
necessary 
step 
for 
thoroughly 
cleansing 
society 
of 
all 
the 
infamies 
and 
abominations 
of 
capitalist 
exploitation, 
and 
for 
further 
progress. 


From 
the 
moment 
all 
members 
of 
society, 
or 
at 
least 
the 
vast 
majority, 
have 
learned 
to 
administer 
the 
state 
themselves, 
have 
taken 
this 
work 
into 
their 
own 
hands, 
have 
organized 
control 
over 
the 
insignificant 
capitalist 
minority, 
over 
the 
gentry 
who 
wish 
to 
preserve 
their 
capitalist 
habits 
and 
over 
the 
workers 
who 
have 
been 
thoroughly 
corrupted 
by 
capitalism-from 
this 
moment 
the 
need 
for 
government 
of 
any 
kind 
begins 
to 
disappear 
altogether. 
The 
more 
complete 
the 
democracy, 
the 
nearer 
the 
moment 
when 
it 
becomes 
unnecessary. 
The 
more 
democratic 
the 
“state” 
which 
consists 
of 
the 
armed 
workers, 
and 
which 
is 
"no 
longer 
a 
state 
in 
the 
proper 
sense 
of 
the 
word", 
the 
more 
rapidly 
every 
form 
of 
state 
begins 
to 
wither 
away. 


For 
when 
all 
have 
learned 
to 
administer 
and 
actually 
to 
independently 
administer 
social 
production, 
independently 
keep 
accounts 
and 
exercise 
control 
over 
the 
parasites, 
the 
sons 
of 
the 
wealthy, 
the 
swindlers 
and 
other 
"guardians 
of 
capitalist 
traditions", 
the 
escape 
from 
this 
popular 
accounting 
and 
control 
will 
inevitably 
become 
so 
incredibly 
difficult, 
such 
a 
rare 
exception, 
and 
will 
probably 
be 
accompanied 
by 
such 
swift 
and 
severe 
punishment 
(for 
the 
armed 
workers 
are 
practical 
men 
and 
not 
sentimental 
intellectuals, 
and 
they 
scarcely 
allow 
anyone 
to 
trifle 
with 
them), 
that 
the 
necessity 
of 
observing 
the 
simple, 
fundamental 
rules 
of 
the 
community 
will 
very 
soon 
become 
a 
habit. 


Then 
the 
door 
will 
be 
thrown 
wide 
open 
for 
the 
transition 
from 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
communist 
society 
to 
its 
higher 
phase, 
and 
with 
it 
to 
the 
complete 
withering 
away

Chapter 
VI: 
The 
Vulgarisation 
of 
Marxism 
by 
Opportunists 



The 
question 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
state 
to 
the 
social 
revolution, 
and 
of 
the 
social 
revolution 
to 
the 
state, 
like 
the 
question 
of 
revolution 
generally, 
was 
given 
very 
little 
attention 
by 
the 
leading 
theoreticians 
and 
publicists 
of 
the 
Second 
International 
(1889-1914). 
But 
the 
most 
characteristic 
thing 
about 
the 
process 
of 
the 
gradual 
growth 
of 
opportunism 
that 
led 
to 
the 
collapse 
of 
the 
Second 
International 
in 
1914 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
even 
when 
these 
people 
were 
squarely 
faced 
with 
this 
question 
they 
tried 
to 
evade 
it 
or 
ignored 
it. 


In 
general, 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
evasiveness 
over 
the 
question 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
proletarian 
revolution 
to 
the 
state-an 
evasiveness 
which 
benefited 
and 
fostered 
opportunism-resulted 
in 
the 
distortion 
of 
Marxism 
and 
in 
its 
complete 
vulgarization. 


To 
characterize 
this 
lamentable 
process, 
if 
only 
briefly, 
we 
shall 
take 
the 
most 
prominent 
theoreticians 
of 
Marxism: 
Plekhanov 
and 
Kautsky. 



1. 
Plekhanov’ 
s 
Controversy 
with 
the 
Anarchists 
Plekhanov 
wrote 
a 
special 
pamphlet 
on 
the 
relation 
of 
anarchism 
to 
socialism, 
entitled 
Anarchism 
and 
Socialism, 
which 
was 
published 
in 
german 
in 
1894. 


In 
treating 
this 
subject, 
Plekhanov 
contrived 
completely 
to 
evade 
the 
most 
urgent, 
burning, 
and 
most 
politically 
essential 
issue 
in 
the 
struggle 
against 
anarchism, 
namely, 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
revolution 
to 
the 
state, 
and 
the 
question 
of 
the 
state 
in 
general! 
His 
pamphlet 
falls 
into 
two 
distinct 
parts: 
one 
of 
them 
is 
historical 
and 
literary, 
and 
contains 
valuable 
material 
on 
the 
history 
of 
the 
ideas 
of 
Stirner, 
Proudhon, 
and 
others; 
the 
other 
is 
philistine, 
and 
contains 
a 
clumsy 
dissertation 
on 
the 
theme 
that 
an 
anarchist 
cannot 
be 
distinguished 
from 
a 
bandit. 


It 
is 
a 
most 
amusing 
combination 
of 
subjects 
and 
most 
characteristic 
of 
Plekhanov’ 
s 
whole 
activity 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
the 
revolution 
and 
during 
the 
revolutionary 
period 
in 
Russia. 
In 
fact, 
in 
the 
years 
1905 
to 
1917, 
Plekhanov 
revealed 
himself 
as 
a 
semi-doctrinaire 
and 
semi-philistine 
who, 
in 
politics, 
trailed 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie. 


We 
have 
now 
seen 
how, 
in 
their 
controversy 
with 
the 
anarchists, 
marx 
and 
Engels 
with 
the 
utmost 
thoroughness 
explained 
their 
views 
on 
the 
relation 
of 
revolution 
to 
the 
state. 
In 
1891, 
in 
his 
foreword 
to 
Marx’ 
s 
Critique 
of 
the 
Gotha 
Programme, 
Engels 
wrote 
that 
“we”-that 
is, 
Engels 
and 
Marx-"were 
at 
that 
time, 
hardly 
two 
years 
after 
the 
Hague 
Congress 
of 
the[30] 
International, 
engaged 
in 
the 
most 
violent 
struggle 
against 
Bakunin 
and 
his 
anarchists." 


The 
anarchists 
had 
tried 
to 
claim 
the 
Paris 
Commune 
as 
their 
“own”, 
so 
to 
say, 
as 
a 
collaboration 
of 
their 
doctrine; 
and 
they 
completely 
misunderstood 
its 
lessons 
and 
Marx’ 
s 
analysis 
of 
these 
lessons. 
Anarchism 
has 
given 
nothing 
even 
approximating 
true 
answers 
to 
the 
concrete 
political 
questions: 
Must 
the 
old 
state 
machine 
be 
smashed? 
And 
what 
should 
be 
put 
in 
its 
place? 


But 
to 
speak 
of 
“anarchism 
and 
socialism” 
while 
completely 
evading 
the 
question 
of 
the 
state, 
and 
disregarding 
the 
whole 
development 
of 
Marxism 
before 
and 
after 
the 
Commune, 
meant 
inevitably 
slipping 
into 
opportunism. 
For 
what 
opportunism 
needs 
most 
of 
all 
is 
that 
the 
two 
questions 
just 
mentioned 
should 
not 
be 
raised 
at 
all. 
That 
in 
itself 
is 
a 
victory 
for 
opportunism. 



2. 
Kautsky’ 
s 
Controversy 
with 
the 
Opportunists 
Undoubtedly, 
an 
immeasurably 
larger 
number 
of 
Kautsky’ 
s 
works 
have 
been 
translated 
into 
Russian 
than 
into 
any 
other 
language. 
It 
is 
not 
without 
reason 
that 
some 
German 
Social-Democrats 
say 
in 
jest 
that 
Kautsky 
is 
read 
more 
in 
Russia 
than 
in 
Germany 
(let 
us 
say, 
in 
parenthesis, 
that 
this 
jest 
has 
a 
far 
deeper 
historical 
meaning 
than 
those 
who 
first 
made 
it 
suspect. 
The 
Russian 
workers, 
by 
making 
in 
1905 
an 
unusually 
great 
and 
unprecedented 
demand 
for 
the 
best 
works 
of 
the 
best 
Social-Democratic 
literature 
and 
editions 
of 
these 
works 
in 
quantities 
unheard 
of 
in 
other 
countries, 
rapidly 
transplanted, 
so 
to 
speak, 
the 
enormous 
experience 
of 
a 
neighboring, 
more 
advanced 
country 
to 
the 
young 
soil 
of 
our 
proletarian 
movement). 


Besides 
his 
popularization 
of 
Marxism, 
Kautsky 
is 
particularly 
known 
in 
our 
country 
for 
his 
controversy 
with 
the 
opportunists, 
with 
Bernstein 
at 
their 
head. 
One 
fact, 
however, 
is 
almost 
unknown, 
one 
which 
cannot 
be 
ignored 
if 
we 
set 
out 
to 
investigate 
how 
Kautsky 
drifted 
into 
the 
morass 
of 
unbelievably 
disgraceful 
confusion 
and 
defence 
of 
social-chauvinism 
during 
the 
supreme 
crisis 
of 
1914-15. 
This 
fact 
is 
as 
follows: 
shortly 
before 
he 
came 
out 
against 
the 
most 
prominent 
representatives 
of 
opportunism 
in 
France 
(Millerand 
and 
Jaures) 
and 
in 
Germany 
(Bernstein), 
Kautsky 
betrayed 
very 
considerable 
vacillation. 
The 
Marxist 
Zarya, 
which 
was 
published 
in 
Stuttgart 
in 
1901-02, 
and 
advocated 
revolutionary 
proletarian 
views, 
was 
forced 
to 
enter 
into 
controversy 
with 
Kautsky 
and 
describe 
as 
“elastic” 
the 
half-hearted, 
evasive 



resolution, 
conciliatory 
towards 
the 
opportunists, 
that 
he 
proposed 
at 
the 
International 
Socialist 
Congress 
in 
Paris 
in 
1900. 
Kautsky’ 
s 
letters 
published 
in 
Germany 
reveal 
no 
less 
hesitancy 
on 
his 
part 
before 
he 
took 
the 
field 
against 
Bernstein. 


Of 
immeasurably 
greater 
significance, 
however, 
is 
the 
fact 
that, 
in 
his 
very 
controversy 
with 
the 
opportunists, 
in 
his 
formulation 
of 
the 
question 
and 
his 
manner 
of 
treating 
it, 
we 
can 
new 
see, 
as 
we 
study 
the 
history 
of 
Kautsky’ 
s 
latest 
betrayal 
of 
Marxism, 
his 
systematic 
deviation 
towards 
opportunism 
precisely 
on 
the 
question 
of 
the 
state. 


Let 
us 
take 
Kautsky’ 
s 
first 
important 
work 
against 
opportunism, 
Bernstein 
and 
the 
Social-Democratic 
Programme. 
Kautsky 
refutes 
Bernstein 
in 
detail, 
but 
here 
is 
a 
characteristic 
thing: 


Bernstein, 
in 
his 
Premises 
of 
Socialism, 
of 
Herostratean 
fame, 
accuses 
Marxism 
of 
“Blanquism” 
(an 
accusation 
since 
repeated 
thousands 
of 
times 
by 
the 
opportunists 
and 
liberal 
bourgeoisie 
in 
Russia 
against 
the 
revolutionary 
Marxists, 
the 
Bolsheviks). 
In 
this 
connection 
Bernstein 
dwells 
particularly 
on 
Marx’ 
s 
The 
Civil 
War 
in 
France, 
and 
tries, 
quite 
unsuccessfully, 
as 
we 
have 
seen, 
to 
identify 
Marx’ 
s 
views 
on 
the 
lessons 
of 
the 
Commune 
with 
those 
of 
Proudhon. 
Bernstein 
pays 
particular 
attention 
to 
the 
conclusion 
which 
Marx 
emphasized 
in 
his 
1872 
preface 
to 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto, 
namely, 
that 
“the 
working 
class 
cannot 
simply 
lay 
hold 
of 
the 
ready-made 
state 
machinery 
and 
wield 
it 
for 
its 
own 
purposes". 


This 
statement 
“pleased” 
Bernstein 
so 
much 
that 
he 
used 
it 
no 
less 
than 
three 
times 
in 
his 
book, 
interpreting 
it 
in 
the 
most 
distorted, 
opportunist 
way. 


As 
we 
have 
seen, 
Marx 
meant 
that 
the 
working-class 
must 
smash, 
break, 
shatter 
(sprengung, 
explosion-the 
expression 
used 
by 
Engels) 
the 
whole 
state 
machine. 
But 
according 
to 
Bernstein 
it 
would 
appear 
as 
though 
Marx 
in 
these 
words 
warned 
the 
working 
class 
against 
excessive 
revolutionary 
zeal 
when 
seizing 
power. 


A 
cruder 
more 
hideous 
distortion 
of 
Marx’ 
s 
idea 
cannot 
be 
imagined. 


How, 
then, 
did 
Kautsky 
proceed 
in 
his 
most 
detailed 
refutation 
of 
Bernsteinism? 


He 
refrained 
from 
analyzing 
the 
utter 
distortion 
of 
Marxism 
by 
opportunism 
on 
this 
point. 
He 
cited 
the 
above-quoted 
passage 
from 
Engels’ 
preface 
to 
Marx’ 
s 
Civil 
War 
and 
said 
that 
according 
to 
Marx 
the 
working 
class 
cannot 
simply 
take 
over 
the 
ready-made 
state 
machinery, 
but 
that, 
generally 
speaking, 
it 
can 
take 
it 
over-and 
that 
was 
all. 
Kautsky 
did 
not 
say 
a 



word 
about 
the 
fact 
that 
Bernstein 
attributed 
to 
Marx 
the 
very 
opposite 
of 
Marx’ 
s 
real 
idea, 
that 
since 
1852 
Marx 
had 
formulated 
the 
task 
of 
the 
proletarian 
revolution 
as 
being 
to 
“smash” 
the 
state 
machine. 


The 
result 
was 
that 
the 
most 
essential 
distinction 
between 
Marxism 
and 
opportunism 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
tasks 
of 
the 
proletarian 
revolution 
was 
slurred 
over 
by 
Kautsky! 


“We 
can 
quite 
safely 
leave 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
problems 
of 
the 
proletarian 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
future,” 
said 
Kautsky, 
writing 
“against” 
Bernstein. 
(p.172, 
German 
edition) 


This 
is 
not 
a 
polemic 
against 
Bernstein, 
but, 
in 
essence, 
a 
concession 
to 
him, 
a 
surrender 
to 
opportunism; 
for 
at 
present 
the 
opportunists 
ask 
nothing 
better 
than 
to 
“quite 
safely 
leave 
to 
the 
future” 
all 
fundamental 
questions 
of 
the 
tasks 
of 
the 
proletarian 
revolution. 


From 
1852 
to 
1891, 
or 
for 
40 
years, 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
taught 
the 
proletariat 
that 
it 
must 
smash 
the 
state 
machine. 
Yet, 
in 
1899, 
Kautsky, 
confronted 
with 
the 
complete 
betrayal 
of 
Marxism 
by 
the 
opportunists 
on 
this 
point, 
fraudulently 
substituted 
for 
the 
question 
whether 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
smash 
this 
machine 
the 
question 
for 
the 
concrete 
forms 
in 
which 
it 
is 
to 
be 
smashed, 
and 
then 
sough 
refuge 
behind 
the 
“indisputable” 
(and 
barren) 
philistine 
truth 
that 
concrete 
forms 
cannot 
be 
known 
in 
advance!! 


A 
gulf 
separates 
Marx 
and 
Kautsky 
over 
their 
attitude 
towards 
the 
proletarian 
party’ 
s 
task 
of 
training 
the 
working 
class 
for 
revolution. 


Let 
us 
take 
the 
next, 
more 
mature, 
work 
by 
Kautsky, 
which 
was 
also 
largely 
devoted 
to 
a 
refutation 
of 
opportunist 
errors. 
It 
is 
his 
pamphlet, 
The 
Social 
Revolution. 
In 
this 
pamphlet, 
the 
author 
chose 
as 
his 
special 
theme 
the 
question 
of 
“the 
proletarian 
revolution” 
and 
“the 
proletarian 
regime". 
He 
gave 
much 
that 
was 
exceedingly 
valuable, 
but 
he 
avoided 
the 
question 
of 
the 
state. 
Throughout 
the 
pamphlet 
the 
author 
speaks 
of 
the 
winning 
of 
state 
power-and 
no 
more; 
that 
is, 
he 
has 
chosen 
a 
formula 
which 
makes 
a 
concession 
to 
the 
opportunists, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
admits 
the 
possibility 
of 
seizing 
power 
without 
destroying 
the 
state 
machine. 
The 
very 
thing 
which 
Marx 
in 
1872 
declared 
to 
be 
“obsolete” 
in 
the 
programme 
of 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto, 
is 
revived 
by 
Kautsky 
in 
1902. 


A 
special 
section 
in 
the 
pamphlet 
is 
devoted 
to 
the 
“forms 
and 
weapons 
of 
the 
social 
revolution". 
Here 
Kautsky 
speaks 
of 
the 
mass 
political 
strike, 
of 
civil 
war, 
and 
of 
the 
“instruments 
of 
the 
might 
of 
the 
modern 
large 
state, 
its 
bureaucracy 
and 
the 
army"; 
but 
he 
does 
not 
say 
a 
word 
about 
what 
the 



Commune 
has 
already 
taught 
the 
workers. 
Evidently, 
it 
was 
not 
without 
reason 
that 
Engels 
issued 
a 
warning, 
particularly 
to 
the 
German 
socialists. 
against 
“superstitious 
reverence” 
for 
the 
state. 


Kautsky 
treats 
the 
matter 
as 
follows: 
the 
victorious 
proletariat 
“will 
carry 
out 
the 
democratic 
programme", 
and 
he 
goes 
on 
to 
formulate 
its 
clauses. 
But 
he 
does 
not 
say 
a 
word 
about 
the 
new 
material 
provided 
in 
1871 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
replacement 
of 
bourgeois 
democracy 
by 
proletarian 
democracy. 
Kautsky 
disposes 
of 
the 
question 
by 
using 
such 
“impressive-sounding” 
banalities 
as: 


“Still, 
it 
goes 
without 
saying 
that 
we 
shall 
not 
achieve 
supremacy 
under 
the 
present 
conditions. 
Revolution 
itself 
presupposes 
long 
and 
deep-going 
struggles, 
which, 
in 
themselves, 
will 
change 
our 
present 
political 
and 
social 
structure." 


Undoubtedly, 
this 
“goes 
without 
saying,” 
just 
as 
the 
fact 
that 
horses 
eat 
oats 
of 
the 
Volga 
flows 
into 
the 
Caspian. 
Only 
it 
is 
a 
pity 
that 
an 
empty 
and 
bombastic 
phrase 
about 
“deep-going” 
struggles 
is 
used 
to 
avoid 
a 
question 
of 
vital 
importance 
to 
the 
revolutionary 
proletariat, 
namely, 
what 
makes 
its 
revolution 
“deep-going” 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
state, 
to 
democracy, 
as 
distinct 
from 
previous, 
non-proletarian 
revolutions. 


By 
avoiding 
this 
question, 
Kautsky 
in 
practice 
makes 
a 
concession 
to 
opportunism 
on 
this 
most 
essential 
point, 
although 
in 
words 
he 
declares 
stern 
war 
against 
it 
and 
stresses 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
“idea 
of 
revolution” 
(how 
much 
is 
this 
“idea” 
worth 
when 
one 
is 
afraid 
to 
teach 
the 
workers 
the 
concrete 
lessons 
of 
revolution?), 
or 
says, 
“revolutionary 
idealism 
before 
everything 
else", 
or 
announces 
that 
the 
English 
workers 
are 
now 
“hardly 
more 
than 
petty 
bourgeois". 


“The 
most 
varied 
form 
of 
enterprises-bureaucratic 
[??], 
trade 
unionist, 
cooperative, 
private… 
can 
exist 
side 
by 
side 
in 
socialist 
society,” 
Kautsky 
writes. 
“… 
There 
are, 
for 
example, 
enterprises 
which 
cannot 
do 
without 
a 
bureaucratic 
[??] 
organization, 
such 
as 
the 
railways. 
Here 
the 
democratic 
organization 
may 
take 
the 
following 
shape: 
the 
workers 
elect 
delegates 
who 
form 
a 
sort 
of 
parliament, 
which 
establishes 
the 
working 
regulations 
and 
supervises 
the 
management 
of 
the 
bureaucratic 
apparatus. 
The 
management 
of 
other 
countries 
may 
be 
transferred 
to 
the 
trade 
unions, 
and 
still 
others 
may 
become 
co-operative 
enterprises." 


This 
argument 
is 
erroneous; 
it 
is 
a 
step 
backward 
compared 
with 
the 
explanations 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
gave 
in 
the 
seventies, 
using 
the 
lessons 
of 
the 



Commune 
as 
an 
example. 


As 
far 
as 
the 
supposedly 
necessary 
“bureaucratic” 
organization 
is 
concerned, 
there 
is 
no 
difference 
whatever 
between 
a 
railway 
and 
any 
other 
enterprise 
in 
large-scale 
machine 
industry, 
any 
factory, 
large 
shop, 
or 
large-
scale 
capitalist 
agricultural 
enterprise. 
The 
technique 
of 
all 
these 
enterprises 
makes 
absolutely 
imperative 
the 
strictest 
discipline, 
the 
utmost 
precision 
on 
the 
part 
of 
everyone 
in 
carry 
out 
his 
allotted 
task, 
for 
otherwise 
the 
whole 
enterprise 
may 
come 
to 
a 
stop, 
or 
machinery 
or 
the 
finished 
product 
may 
be 
damaged. 
In 
all 
these 
enterprises 
the 
workers 
will, 
of 
course, 
“elect 
delegates 
who 
will 
form 
a 
sort 
of 
parliament". 


The 
whole 
point, 
however, 
is 
that 
this 
“sort 
of 
parliament” 
will 
not 
be 
a 
parliament 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
a 
bourgeois 
parliamentary 
institution. 
The 
whole 
point 
is 
that 
this 
“sort 
of 
parliament” 
will 
not 
merely 
“establish 
the 
working 
regulations 
and 
supervise 
the 
management 
of 
the 
bureaucratic 
apparatus,” 
as 
Kautsky, 
whose 
thinking 
does 
not 
go 
beyond 
the 
bounds 
of 
bourgeois 
parliamentarianism, 
imagines. 
In 
socialist 
society, 
the 
“sort 
of 
parliament” 
consisting 
of 
workers’ 
deputies 
will, 
of 
course, 
“establish 
the 
working 
regulations 
and 
supervise 
the 
management” 
of 
the 
“apparatus,” 
but 
this 
apparatus 
will 
not 
be 
“bureaucratic.” 


Kautsky 
has 
not 
reflected 
at 
all 
on 
Marx’ 
s 
words: 
“The 
Commune 
was 
a 
working, 
not 
parliamentary, 
body, 
executive 
and 
legislative 
at 
the 
same 
time." 


Kautsky 
has 
not 
understood 
at 
all 
the 
difference 
between 
bourgeois 
parliamentarism, 
which 
combines 
democracy 
(not 
for 
the 
people) 
with 
bureaucracy 
(against 
the 
people), 
and 
proletarian 
democracy, 
which 
will 
take 
immediate 
steps 
to 
cut 
bureaucracy 
down 
to 
the 
roots, 
and 
which 
will 
be 
able 
to 
carry 
these 
measures 
through 
to 
the 
end, 
to 
the 
complete 
abolition 
of 
bureaucracy, 
to 
the 
introduction 
of 
complete 
democracy 
for 
the 
people. 


Kautsky 
here 
displays 
the 
same 
old 
“superstitious 
reverence” 
for 
the 
state, 
and 
“superstitious 
belief” 
in 
bureaucracy. 


Let 
us 
now 
pass 
to 
the 
last 
and 
best 
of 
Kautsky’ 
s 
works 
against 
the 
opportunists, 
his 
pamphlet 
The 
Road 
to 
Power 
(which, 
I 
believe, 
has 
not 
been 
published 
in 
Russian, 
for 
it 
appeared 
in 
1909, 
when 
reaction 
was 
at 
its 
height 
in 
our 
country). 
This 
pamphlet 
is 
a 
big 
step 
forward, 
since 
it 
does 
not 
deal 
with 
the 
revolutionary 
programme 
in 
general, 
as 
the 
pamphlet 
of 
1899 
against 
Bernstein, 
or 
with 
the 
tasks 
of 
the 
social 
revolution 
irrespective 
of 
the 
time 
of 
its 
occurrence, 
as 
the 
1902 
pamphlet, 
The 
Social 
Revolution; 
it 
deals 
with 
the 



concrete 
conditions 
which 
compels 
us 
to 
recognize 
that 
the 
“era 
of 
revolutions” 
is 
setting 
in. 


The 
author 
explicitly 
points 
to 
the 
aggravation 
of 
class 
antagonisms 
in 
general 
and 
to 
imperialism, 
which 
plays 
a 
particularly 
important 
part 
in 
this 
respect. 
After 
the 
“revolutionary 
period 
of 
1789-1871” 
in 
Western 
Europe, 
he 
says, 
a 
similar 
period 
began 
in 
the 
East 
in 
1905. 
A 
world 
war 
is 
approaching 
with 
menacing 
rapidity. 
“It[31] 
can 
no 
longer 
talk 
of 
premature 
revolution.” 
“We 
have 
entered 
a 
revolutionary 
period.” 
The 
“revolutionary 
era 
is 
beginning". 


These 
statements 
are 
perfectly 
clear. 
This 
pamphlet 
of 
Kautsky’ 
s 
should 
serve 
as 
a 
measure 
of 
comparison 
of 
what 
the 
German 
Social-Democrats 
promised 
to 
be 
before 
the 
imperialist 
war 
and 
the 
depth 
of 
degradation 
to 
which 
they, 
including 
Kautsky 
himself, 
sank 
when 
the 
war 
broke 
out. 
“The 
present 
situation,” 
Kautsky 
wrote 
in 
the 
pamphlet 
under 
survey, 
“is 
fraught 
with 
the 
danger 
that 
we[32] 
may 
easily 
appear 
to 
be 
more 
’ 
moderate’ 
than 
we 
really 
are.” 
It 
turned 
out 
that 
in 
reality 
the 
German 
Social-Democratic 
Party 
was 
much 
more 
moderate 
and 
opportunist 
than 
it 
appeared 
to 
be! 


It 
is 
all 
the 
more 
characteristic, 
therefore, 
that 
although 
Kautsky 
so 
explicitly 
declared 
that 
the 
era 
of 
revolution 
had 
already 
begun, 
in 
the 
pamphlet 
which 
he 
himself 
said 
was 
devoted 
to 
an 
analysis 
of 
the 
“political 
revolution", 
he 
again 
completely 
avoided 
the 
question 
of 
the 
state. 


These 
evasions 
of 
the 
question, 
these 
omissions 
and 
equivocations, 
inevitably 
added 
up 
to 
that 
complete 
swing-over 
to 
opportunism 
with 
which 
we 
shall 
now 
have 
to 
deal. 


Kautsky, 
the 
German 
Social-Democrats’ 
spokesman, 
seems 
to 
have 
declared: 
I 
abide 
by 
revolutionary 
views 
(1899), 
I 
recognize, 
above 
all, 
the 
inevitability 
of 
the 
social 
revolution 
of 
the 
proletariat 
(1902), 
I 
recognize 
the 
advent 
of 
a 
new 
era 
of 
revolutions 
(1909). 
Still, 
I 
am 
going 
back 
on 
what 
Marx 
said 
as 
early 
as 
1852, 
since 
the 
question 
of 
the 
tasks 
of 
the 
proletarian 
revolution 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
state 
is 
being 
raised 
(1912). 


It 
was 
in 
this 
point-blank 
form 
that 
the 
question 
was 
put 
in 
Kautsky’ 
s 
controversy 
with 
Pannekoek. 



3. 
Kautsky’ 
s 
Controversy 
with 
Pannekoek 
In 
opposing 
Kautsky, 
Pannekoek 
came 
out 
as 
one 
of 
the 
representatives 
of 
the 
“Left 
radical” 
trend 
which 
included 
Rosa 
Luxemburg, 
Karl 
Radek, 
and 
others. 
Advocating 
revolutionary 
tactics, 
they 
were 
united 
in 
the 
conviction 
that 
Kautsky 
was 
going 
over 
to 
the 
“Centre”, 
which 
wavered 
in 
an 
unprincipled 
manner 
between 
Marxism 
and 
opportunism. 
This 
view 
was 
proved 
perfectly 
correct 
by 
the 
war, 
when 
this 
“Centrist” 
(wrongly 
called 
Marxist) 
trend, 
or 
Kautskyism, 
revealed 
itself 
in 
all 
its 
repulsive 
wretchedness. 


In 
an 
article 
touching 
on 
the 
question 
of 
the 
state, 
entitled 
“Mass 
Action 
and 
Revolution” 
(Neue 
Zeit, 
1912, 
Vol.XXX, 
2), 
Pannekoek 
described 
kautsky’ 
s 
attitude 
as 
one 
of 
“passive 
radicalism", 
as 
“a 
theory 
of 
inactive 
expectancy". 
“Kautsky 
refuses 
to 
see 
the 
process 
of 
revolution,” 
wrote 
Pannekoek 
(p.616). 
In 
presenting 
the 
matter 
in 
this 
way, 
Pannekoek 
approached 
the 
subject 
which 
interests 
us, 
namely, 
the 
tasks 
of 
the 
proletarian 
revolution 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
state. 


“The 
struggle 
of 
the 
proletariat,” 
he 
wrote, 
“is 
not 
merely 
a 
struggle 
against 
the 
bourgeoisie 
for 
state 
power, 
but 
a 
struggle 
against 
state 
power… 
The 
content 
of 
this[33] 
revolution 
is 
the 
destruction 
and 
dissolution[34] 
of 
the 
instruments 
of 
power 
of 
the 
state 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
instruments 
of 
power 
of 
the 
proletariat. 
(p.544) 
“The 
struggle 
will 
cease 
only 
when, 
as 
the 
result 
of 
it, 
the 
state 
organization 
is 
completely 
destroyed. 
The 
organization 
of 
the 



majority 
will 
then 
have 
demonstrated 
its 
superiority 
by 
destroying 
the 
organization 
of 
the 
ruling 
minority.” 
(p.548) 


The 
formulation 
in 
which 
Pannekoek 
presented 
his 
ideas 
suffers 
from 
serious 
defects. 
But 
its 
meaning 
is 
clear 
nonetheless, 
and 
it 
is 
interesting 
to 
note 
how 
Kautsky 
combated 
it. 


“Up 
to 
now,” 
he 
wrote, 
“the 
antithesis 
between 
the 
Social-Democrats 
and 
the 
anarchists 
has 
been 
that 
the 
former 
wished 
to 
win 
the 
state 
power 
while 
the 
latter 
wished 
to 
destroy 
it. 
Pannekoek 
wants 
to 
do 
both.” 
(p.724) 


Although 
Pannekoek’ 
s 
exposition 
lacks 
precision 
and 
concreteness-not 
to 
speak 
of 
other 
shortcomings 
of 
his 
article 
which 
have 
no 
bearing 
on 
the 
present 
subject-Kautsky 
seized 
precisely 
on 
the 
point 
of 
principle 
raised 
by 
Pannekoek; 
and 
on 
this 
fundamental 
point 
of 
principle 
Kautsky 
completely 
abandoned 
the 
Marxist 
position 
and 
went 
over 
wholly 
to 
opportunism. 
His 
definition 
of 
the 
distinction 
between 
the 
Social-Democrats 
and 
the 
anarchists 
is 
absolutely 
wrong; 
he 
completely 
vulgarizes 
and 
distorts 
Marxism. 


The 
distinction 
between 
Marxists 
and 
the 
anarchists 
is 
this: 
(1) 
The 
former, 
while 
aiming 
at 
the 
complete 
abolition 
of 
the 
state, 
recognize 
that 
this 
aim 
can 
only 
be 
achieved 
after 
classes 
have 
been 
abolished 
by 
the 
socialist 
revolution, 
as 
the 
result 
of 
the 
establishment 
of 
socialism, 
which 
leads 
to 
the 
withering 
away 
of 
the 
state. 
The 
latter 
want 
to 
abolish 
he 
state 
completely 
overnight, 
not 
understanding 
the 
conditions 
under 
which 
the 
state 
can 
be 
abolished. 
(2) 
The 
former 
recognize 
that 
after 
the 
proletariat 
has 
won 
political 
power 
it 
must 
completely 
destroy 
the 
old 
state 
machine 
and 
replace 
it 
by 
a 
new 
one 
consisting 
of 
an 
organization 
of 
the 
armed 
workers, 
after 
the 
type 
of 
the 
Commune. 
The 
latter, 
while 
insisting 
on 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
state 
machine, 
have 
a 
very 
vague 
idea 
of 
what 
the 
proletariat 
will 
put 
in 
its 
place 
and 
how 
it 
will 
use 
its 
revolutionary 
power. 
The 
anarchists 
even 
deny 
that 
the 
revolutionary 
proletariat 
should 
use 
the 
state 
power, 
they 
reject 
its 
revolutionary 
dictatorship. 
(3) 
The 
former 
demand 
that 
the 
proletariat 
be 
trained 
for 
revolution 
by 
utilizing 
the 
present 
state. 
The 
anarchists 
reject 
this. 


In 
this 
controversy, 
it 
is 
not 
Kautsky 
but 
Pannekoek 
who 
represents 
Marxism, 
for 
it 
was 
Marx 
who 
taught 
that 
the 
proletariat 
cannot 
simply 
win 
state 
power 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
the 
old 
state 
apparatus 
passes 
into 
new 
hands, 
but 
must 
smash 
this 
apparatus, 
must 
break 
it 
and 
replace 
it 
by 
a 
new 
one. 


Kautsky 
abandons 
Marxism 
for 
the 
opportunist 
camp, 
for 
this 
destruction 
of 
the 
state 
machine, 
which 
is 
utterly 
unacceptable 
to 
the 
opportunists, 
completely 
disappears 
from 
his 
argument, 
and 
he 
leaves 
a 
loophole 
for 
them 



in 
that 
“conquest” 
may 
be 
interpreted 
as 
the 
simple 
acquisition 
of 
a 
majority. 


To 
cover 
up 
his 
distortion 
of 
Marxism, 
Kautsky 
behaves 
like 
a 
doctrinaire: 
he 
puts 
forward 
a 
“quotation” 
from 
Marx 
himself. 
In 
1850, 
Marx 
wrote 
that 
a 
“resolute 
centralization 
of 
power 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
state 
authority” 
was 
necessary, 
and 
Kautsky 
triumphantly 
asks: 
does 
Pannekoek 
want 
to 
destroy 
“Centralism”? 


This 
is 
simply 
a 
trick, 
like 
Bernstein’ 
s 
identification 
of 
the 
views 
of 
Marxism 
and 
Proudhonism 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
federalism 
as 
against 
centralism. 


Kautsky’ 
s 
“quotation” 
is 
neither 
here 
nor 
there. 
Centralism 
is 
possible 
with 
both 
the 
old 
and 
the 
new 
state 
machine. 
If 
the 
workers 
voluntarily 
unite 
their 
armed 
forces, 
this 
will 
be 
centralism, 
but 
it 
will 
be 
based 
on 
the 
“complete 
destruction” 
of 
the 
centralized 
state 
apparatus-the 
standing 
army, 
the 
police, 
and 
the 
bureaucracy. 
Kautsky 
acts 
like 
an 
outright 
swindler 
by 
evading 
the 
perfectly 
well-known 
arguments 
of 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
on 
the 
Commune 
and 
plucking 
out 
a 
quotation 
which 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
point 
at 
issue. 


“Perhaps 
he,[35]” 
Kautsky 
continues, 
“wants 
to 
abolish 
the 
state 
functions 
of 
the 
officials? 
But 
we 
cannot 
do 
without 
officials 
even 
in 
the 
party 
and 
trade 
unions, 
let 
alone 
in 
the 
state 
administration. 
And 
our 
programme 
does 
not 
demand 
the 
abolition 
of 
state 
officials, 
but 
that 
they 
be 
elected 
by 
the 
people… 
We 
are 
discussing 
here 
not 
the 
form 
the 
administrative 
apparatus 
of 
the 
’ 
future 
state’ 
will 
assume, 
but 
whether 
our 
political 
struggle 
abolishes[36] 
the 
state 
power 
before 
we 
have 
captured 
it.[37] 
Which 
ministry 
with 
its 
officials 
could 
be 
abolished?” 
Then 
follows 
an 
enumeration 
of 
the 
ministeries 
of 
education, 
justice, 
finance, 
and 
war. 
“No, 
not 
one 
of 
the 
present 
ministries 
will 
be 
removed 
by 
our 
political 
struggle 
against 
the 
government… 
I 
repeat, 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
misunderstanding: 
we 
are 
not 
discussing 
here 
the 
form 
the 
’ 
future 
state’ 
will 
be 
given 
by 
the 
victorious 
Social-Democrats, 
but 
how 
the 
present 
state 
is 
changed 
by 
our 
opposition.” 
(p.725) 


This 
is 
an 
obvious 
trick. 
Pannekoek 
raised 
the 
question 
of 
revolution. 
Both 
the 
title 
of 
his 
article 
and 
the 
passages 
quoted 
above 
clearly 
indicate 
this. 
By 
skipping 
to 
the 
question 
of 
“opposition”, 
Kautksy 
substitutes 
the 
opportunist 
for 
the 
revolutionary 
point 
of 
view. 
What 
he 
says 
means: 
at 
present 
we 
are 
an 
opposition; 
what 
we 
shall 
be 
after 
we 
have 
captured 
power, 
that 
we 
shall 
see. 
Revolution 
has 
vanished! 
And 
that 
is 
exactly 
what 
the 
opportunists 
wanted. 


The 
point 
at 
issue 
is 
neither 
opposition 
nor 
political 
struggle 
in 
general, 



but 
revolution. 
Revolution 
consists 
in 
the 
proletariat 
destroying 
the 
“administrative 
apparatus” 
and 
the 
whole 
state 
machine, 
replacing 
it 
by 
a 
new 
one, 
made 
up 
of 
the 
armed 
workers. 
Kautsky 
displays 
a 
“superstitious 
reverence” 
for 
“ministries”; 
but 
why 
can 
they 
not 
be 
replaced, 
say, 
by 
committees 
of 
specialists 
working 
under 
sovereign, 
all-powerful 
Soviets 
of 
Workers’ 
and 
Soldiers’ 
Deputies? 


The 
point 
is 
not 
at 
all 
whether 
the 
“ministries” 
will 
remain, 
or 
whether 
“committees 
of 
specialists” 
or 
some 
other 
bodies 
will 
be 
set 
up; 
that 
is 
quite 
immaterial. 
The 
point 
is 
whether 
the 
old 
state 
machine 
(bound 
by 
thousands 
of 
threads 
to 
the 
bourgeoisie 
and 
permeated 
through 
and 
through 
with 
routine 
and 
inertia) 
shall 
remain, 
or 
be 
destroyed 
and 
replaced 
by 
a 
new 
one. 
Revolution 
consists 
not 
in 
the 
new 
class 
commanding, 
governing 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
old 
state 
machine, 
but 
in 
this 
class 
smashing 
this 
machine 
and 
commanding, 
governing 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
a 
new 
machine. 
Kautsky 
slurs 
over 
this 
basic 
idea 
of 
Marxism, 
or 
he 
does 
not 
understand 
it 
at 
all. 


His 
question 
about 
officials 
clearly 
shows 
that 
he 
does 
not 
understand 
the 
lessons 
of 
the 
Commune 
or 
the 
teachings 
of 
Marx. 
“We 
cannot 
to 
without 
officials 
even 
in 
the 
party 
and 
the 
trade 
unions…" 


We 
cannot 
do 
without 
officials 
under 
capitalism, 
under 
the 
rule 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
The 
proletariat 
is 
oppressed, 
the 
working 
people 
are 
enslaved 
by 
capitalism. 
Under 
capitalism, 
democracy 
is 
restricted, 
cramped, 
curtailed, 
mutilated 
by 
all 
the 
conditions 
of 
wage 
slavery, 
and 
the 
poverty 
and 
misery 
of 
the 
people. 
This 
and 
this 
alone 
is 
the 
reason 
why 
the 
functionaries 
of 
our 
political 
organizations 
and 
trade 
unions 
are 
corrupted 
-or 
rather 
tend 
to 
be 
corrupted-by 
the 
conditions 
of 
capitalism 
and 
betray 
a 
tendency 
to 
become 
bureaucrats, 
i.e., 
privileged 
persons 
divorced 
from 
the 
people 
and 
standing 
above 
the 
people. 


That 
is 
the 
essence 
of 
bureaucracy; 
and 
until 
the 
capitalists 
have 
been 
expropriated 
and 
the 
bourgeoisie 
overthrown, 
even 
proletarian 
functionaries 
will 
inevitably 
be 
“bureaucratized” 
to 
a 
certain 
extent. 


According 
to 
Kautsky, 
since 
elected 
functionaries 
will 
remain 
under 
socialism, 
so 
will 
officials, 
so 
will 
the 
bureaucracy! 
This 
is 
exactly 
where 
he 
is 
wrong. 
Marx, 
referring 
to 
the 
example 
of 
the 
Commune, 
showed 
that 
under 
socialism 
functionaries 
will 
cease 
to 
be 
“bureaucrats”, 
to 
be 
“officials”, 
they 
will 
cease 
to 
be 
so 
in 
proportion 
as-in 
addition 
to 
the 
principle 
of 
election 
of 
officials-the 
principle 
of 
recall 
at 
any 
time 
is 
also 
introduced, 
as 
salaries 
are 
reduced 
to 
the 
level 
of 
the 
wages 
of 
the 
average 
workman, 
and 
as 



parliamentary 
institutions 
are 
replaced 
by 
“working 
bodies, 
executive 
and 
legislative 
at 
the 
same 
time". 


As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
the 
whole 
of 
Kautsky’ 
s 
argument 
against 
Pannekoek, 
and 
particularly 
the 
former’ 
s 
wonderful 
point 
that 
we 
cannot 
do 
without 
officials 
even 
in 
our 
party 
and 
trade 
union 
organizations, 
is 
merely 
a 
repetition 
of 
Bernstein’ 
s 
old 
“arguments” 
against 
Marxism 
in 
general. 
In 
his 
renegade 
book, 
The 
Premises 
of 
Socialism, 
Bernstein 
combats 
the 
ideas 
of 
“primitive” 
democracy, 
combats 
what 
he 
calls 
“doctrinaire 
democracy": 
binding 
mandates, 
unpaid 
officials, 
impotent 
central 
representative 
bodies, 
etc. 
to 
prove 
that 
this 
“primitive” 
democracy 
is 
unsound, 
Bernstein 
refers 
to 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
British 
trade 
unions, 
as 
interpreted 
by 
the 
Webbs. 
Seventy 
years 
of 
development 
“in 
absolute 
freedom", 
he 
says 
(p.137, 
German 
edition), 
convinced 
the 
trade 
unions 
that 
primitive 
democracy 
was 
useless, 
and 
they 
replaced 
it 
by 
ordinary 
democracy, 
i.e., 
parliamentarism 
combined 
with 
bureaucracy. 


In 
reality, 
the 
trade 
unions 
did 
not 
develop 
“in 
absolute 
freedom” 
but 
in 
absolute 
capitalist 
slavery, 
under 
which, 
it 
goes 
without 
saying, 
a 
number 
of 
concessions 
to 
the 
prevailing 
evil, 
violence, 
falsehood, 
exclusion 
of 
the 
poor 
from 
the 
affairs 
of 
“higher” 
administration, 
“cannot 
be 
done 
without". 
Under 
socialism 
much 
of 
“primitive” 
democracy 
will 
inevitably 
be 
revived, 
since, 
for 
the 
first 
time 
in 
the 
history 
of 
civilized 
society 
the 
mass 
of 
population 
will 
rise 
to 
taking 
an 
independent 
part, 
not 
only 
in 
voting 
and 
elections, 
but 
also 
in 
the 
everyday 
administration 
of 
the 
state. 
Under 
socialism 
all 
will 
govern 
in 
turn 
and 
will 
soon 
become 
accustomed 
to 
no 
one 
governing. 


Marx’ 
s 
critico-analytical 
genius 
saw 
in 
the 
practical 
measures 
of 
the 
Commune 
the 
turning-point 
which 
the 
opportunists 
fear 
and 
do 
not 
want 
to 
recognize 
because 
of 
their 
cowardice, 
because 
they 
do 
not 
want 
to 
break 
irrevocably 
with 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
and 
which 
the 
anarchists 
do 
not 
want 
to 
see, 
either 
because 
they 
are 
in 
a 
hurry 
or 
because 
they 
do 
not 
understand 
at 
all 
the 
conditions 
of 
great 
social 
changes. 
“We 
must 
not 
even 
think 
of 
destroying 
the 
old 
state 
machine; 
how 
can 
we 
do 
without 
ministries 
and 
officials›” 
argues 
the 
opportunist, 
who 
is 
completely 
saturated 
with 
philistinism 
and 
who, 
at 
bottom, 
not 
only 
does 
not 
believe 
in 
revolution, 
in 
the 
creative 
power 
of 
revolution, 
but 
lives 
in 
mortal 
dread 
of 
it 
(like 
our 
Mensheviks 
and 
Socialist-
Revolutionaries). 


“We 
must 
think 
only 
of 
destroying 
the 
old 
state 
machine; 
it 
is 
no 
use 
probing 
into 
the 
concrete 
lessons 
of 
earlier 
proletarian 
revolutions 
and 



analyzing 
what 
to 
put 
in 
the 
place 
of 
what 
has 
been 
destroyed, 
and 
how,” 
argues 
the 
anarchist 
(the 
best 
of 
the 
anarchist, 
of 
course, 
and 
not 
those 
who, 
following 
the 
Kropotkins 
and 
Co., 
trail 
behind 
the 
bourgeoisie). 
Consequently, 
the 
tactics 
of 
the 
anarchist 
become 
the 
tactics 
of 
despair 
instead 
of 
a 
ruthlessly 
bold 
revolutionary 
effort 
to 
solve 
concrete 
problems 
while 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
practical 
conditions 
of 
the 
mass 
movement. 


Marx 
teaches 
us 
to 
avoid 
both 
errors; 
he 
teaches 
us 
to 
act 
with 
supreme 
boldness 
in 
destroying 
the 
entire 
old 
state 
machine, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
he 
teaches 
us 
to 
put 
the 
question 
concretely: 
the 
Commune 
was 
able 
in 
the 
space 
of 
a 
few 
weeks 
to 
start 
building 
a 
new, 
proletarian 
state 
machine 
by 
introducing 
such-and-such 
measures 
to 
provide 
wider 
democracy 
and 
to 
uproot 
bureaucracy. 
Let 
us 
learn 
revolutionary 
boldness 
from 
the 
Communards; 
let 
us 
see 
in 
their 
practical 
measures 
the 
outline 
of 
really 
urgent 
and 
immediately 
possible 
measures, 
and 
then, 
following 
this 
road, 
we 
shall 
achieve 
the 
complete 
destruction 
of 
bureaucracy. 


The 
possibility 
of 
this 
destruction 
is 
guaranteed 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
socialism 
will 
shorten 
the 
working 
day, 
will 
raise 
the 
people 
to 
a 
new 
life, 
will 
create 
such 
conditions 
for 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
population 
as 
will 
enable 
everybody, 
without 
exception, 
to 
perform 
“state 
functions", 
and 
this 
will 
lead 
to 
the 
complete 
withering 
away 
of 
every 
form 
of 
state 
in 
general. 


“Its 
object,[38]” 
Kautsky 
continues, 
“cannot 
be 
to 
destroy 
the 
state 
power; 
its 
only 
object 
can 
be 
to 
make 
the 
government 
compliant 
on 
some 
specific 
question, 
or 
to 
replace 
a 
government 
hostile 
to 
the 
proletariat 
by 
one 
willing 
to 
meet 
it 
half-way…[39] 
But 
never, 
under 
no 
circumstances 
can 
it[40] 
lead 
to 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
state 
power; 
it 
can 
lead 
only 
to 
a 
certain 
shifting[41] 
of 
the 
balance 
of 
forces 
within 
the 
state 
power… 
The 
aim 
of 
our 
political 
struggle 
remains, 
as 
in 
the 
past, 
the 
conquest 
of 
state 
power 
by 
winning 
a 
majority 
in 
parliament 
and 
by 
raising 
parliament 
to 
the 
ranks 
of 
master 
of 
the 
government.” 
(pp.726, 
727, 
732) 


This 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
purest 
and 
most 
vulgar 
opportunism: 
repudiating 
revolution 
in 
deeds, 
while 
accepting 
it 
in 
words. 
Kautsky’ 
s 
thoughts 
go 
no 
further 
than 
a 
“government… 
willing 
to 
meet 
the 
proletariat 
half-way"-a 
step 
backward 
to 
philistinism 
compared 
with 
1847, 
when 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto 
proclaimed 
“the 
organization 
of 
the 
proletariat 
as 
the 
ruling 
class". 


Kautsky 
will 
have 
to 
achieve 
his 
beloved 
“unity” 
with 
the 
Scheidmanns, 
Plekhanovs, 
and 
Vanderveldes, 
all 
of 
whom 
agree 
to 
fight 
for 
a 
government 
“willing 
to 
meet 
the 
proletariat 
half-way". 



We, 
however, 
shall 
break 
with 
these 
traitors 
to 
socialism, 
and 
we 
shall 
fight 
for 
the 
complete 
destruction 
of 
the 
old 
state 
machine, 
in 
order 
that 
the 
armed 
proletariat 
itself 
may 
become 
the 
government. 
These 
are 
two 
vastly 
different 
things. 


Kautsky 
will 
have 
to 
enjoy 
the 
pleasant 
company 
of 
the 
Legiens 
and 
Davids, 
Plekhanovs, 
Potresovs, 
Tseretelis, 
and 
Chernovs, 
who 
are 
quite 
willing 
to 
work 
for 
the 
“shifting 
of 
the 
balance 
of 
forces 
within 
the 
state 
power", 
for 
“winning 
a 
majority 
in 
parliament", 
and 
“raising 
parliament 
to 
the 
ranks 
of 
master 
of 
the 
government". 
A 
most 
worthy 
object, 
which 
is 
wholly 
acceptable 
to 
the 
opportunists 
and 
which 
keeps 
everything 
within 
the 
bounds 
of 
the 
bourgeois 
parliamentary 
republic. 


We, 
however, 
shall 
break 
with 
the 
opportunists; 
and 
the 
entire 
class-
conscious 
proletariat 
will 
be 
with 
us 
in 
the 
fight-not 
to 
“shift 
the 
balance 
of 
forces", 
but 
to 
overthrow 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
to 
destroy 
bourgeois 
parliamentarism, 
for 
a 
democratic 
republic 
after 
the 
type 
of 
the 
Commune, 
or 
a 
republic 
of 
Soviets 
of 
Workers’ 
and 
Soldiers’ 
Deputies, 
for 
the 
revolutionary 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat. 


To 
the 
right 
of 
Kautsky 
in 
international 
socialism 
there 
are 
trends 
such 
as 
Socialist 
Monthly 
in 
Germany 
(Legien, 
David, 
Kolb, 
and 
many 
others, 
including 
the 
Scandinavian 
Stauning 
and 
Branting), 
Jaures’ 
followers 
and 
Vandervelde 
in 
France 
and 
Belgium; 
Turait, 
Treves, 
and 
other 
Right-wingers 
of 
the 
Italian 
Party; 
the 
Fabians 
and 
“Independents” 
(the 
Independent 
labor 
Party, 
which, 
in 
fact, 
has 
always 
been 
dependent 
on 
the 
Liberals) 
in 
Britain; 
and 
the 
like. 
All 
these 
gentry, 
who 
play 
a 
tremendous, 
very 
often 
a 
predominant 
role 
in 
the 
parliamentary 
work 
and 
the 
press 
of 
their 
parties, 
repudiate 
outright 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat 
and 
pursue 
a 
policy 
of 
undisguised 
opportunism. 
In 
the 
eyes 
of 
these 
gentry, 
the 
“dictatorship” 
of 
the 
proletariat 
“contradicts” 
democracy!! 
There 
is 
really 
no 
essential 
distinction 
between 
them 
and 
the 
petty-bourgeois 
democrats. 


Taking 
this 
circumstance 
into 
consideration, 
we 
are 
justified 
in 
drawing 
the 
conclusion 
that 
the 
Second 
International, 
that 
is, 
the 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
its 
official 
representatives, 
has 
completely 
sunk 
into 
opportunism. 
The 
experience 
of 
the 
Commune 
has 
been 
not 
only 
ignored 
but 
distorted. 
far 
from 
inculcating 
in 
the 
workers’ 
minds 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
time 
is 
nearing 
when 
they 
must 
act 
to 
smash 
the 
old 
state 
machine, 
replace 
it 
by 
a 
new 
one, 
and 
in 
this 
way 
make 
their 
political 
rule 
the 
foundation 
for 
the 
socialist 
reorganization 
of 
society, 
they 
have 
actually 
preached 
to 
the 
masses 
the 
very 



opposite 
and 
have 
depicted 
the 
“conquest 
of 
power” 
in 
a 
way 
that 
has 
left 
thousands 
of 
loopholes 
for 
opportunism. 


The 
distortion 
and 
hushing 
up 
of 
the 
question 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
proletarian 
revolution 
to 
the 
state 
could 
not 
but 
play 
an 
immense 
role 
at 
a 
time 
when 
states, 
which 
possess 
a 
military 
apparatus 
expanded 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
imperialist 
rivalry, 
have 
become 
military 
monsters 
which 
are 
exterminating 
millions 
of 
people 
in 
order 
to 
settle 
the 
issue 
as 
to 
whether 
Britain 
or 
Germany-this 
or 
that 
finance 
capital-is 
to 
rule 
the 
world.

to 
the 
First 
Edition 


This 
pamphlet 
was 
written 
in 
August 
and 
September 
1917. 
I 
had 
already 
drawn 
up 
the 
plan 
for 
the 
next, 
the 
seventh 
chapter, 
"The 
Experience 
of 
the 
Russian 
Revolutions 
of 
1905 
and 
1917". 
Apart 
from 
the 
title, 
however, 
I 
had 
no 
time 
to 
write 
a 
single 
line 
of 
the 
chapter; 
I 
was 
"interrupted" 
by 
a 
political 
crisis-the 
eve 
of 
the 
October 
revolution 
of 
1917. 
Such 
an 
"interruption" 
can 
only 
be 
welcomed; 
but 
the 
writing 
of 
the 
second 
part 
of 
this 
pamphlet 
("The 
Experience 
of 
the 
Russian 
Revolutions 
of 
1905 
and 
1917") 
will 
probably 
have 
to 
be 
put 
off 
for 
a 
long 
time. 
It 
is 
more 
pleasant 
and 
useful 
to 
go 
through 
the 
"experience 
of 
revolution" 
than 
to 
write 
about 
it.

Preface 


According 
to 
the 
author's 
original 
plan, 
the 
present 
pamphlet 
was 
to 
have 
been 
devoted 
to 
a 
detailed 
development 
of 
the 
ideas 
expressed 
in 
the 
article 
"Where 
To 
Begin?" 
(Iskra,[2] 
No. 
4, 
May 
19O1).[3] 
And 
we 
must 
first 
of 
all 
apologize 
to 
the 
reader 
for 
the 
delay 
in 
fulfilling 
the 
promise 
made 
in 
that 
article 
(and 
repeated 
in 
reply 
to 
many 
private 
in 
quiries 
and 
letters). 
One 
of 
the 
reasons 
for 
this 
delay 
was 
the 
attempt 
made 
last 
June 
(1901) 
to 
unite 
all 
the 
Social-Democratic 
organizations 
abroad. 
It 
was 
natural 
to 
wait 
for 
the 
results 
of 
this 
attempt, 
for 
if 
it 
were 
successful 
it 
would 
perhaps 
have 
been 
necessary 
to 
expound 
the 
Iskra's 
views 
on 
organization 
from 
a 
somewhat 
different 
angle; 
and 
in 
any 
case, 
such 
a 
success 
promised 
to 
put 
a 
very 
early 
end 
to 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
two 
trends 
in 
the 
Russian 
Social-Democratic 
movement. 
As 
the 
reader 
knows, 
the 
attempt 
failed, 
and, 
as 
we 
shall 
try 
to 
show 
here, 
was 
bound 
to 
fail 
after 
the 
new 
swing 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 


[4] 
in 
its 
issue 
No. 
10, 
towards 
Economism. 
It 
proved 
absolutely 
essential 
to 
commence 
a 
determined 
fight 
against 
this 
diffuse 
and 
ill-defined, 
but 
very 
persistent 
trend, 
one 
capable 
of 
appearing 
again 
in 
diverse 
forms. 
Accordingly, 
the 
original 
plan 
of 
the 
pamphlet 
was 
altered 
and 
very 
considerably 
enlarged. 
Its 
main 
theme 
was 
to 
have 
been 
the 
three 
questions 
raised 
in 
the 
article 
"Where 
To 
Begin?" 
--viz., 
the 
character 
and 
principal 
content 
of 
our 
political 
agitation, 
our 
organizational 
tasks; 
and 
the 
plan 
for 
building, 
simultaneously 
and 
from 
various 
ends, 
a 
militant, 
all-Russian 
organization. 
These 
questions 
have 
long 
engaged 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
author, 
who 
already 
tried 
to 
raise 
them 
in 
the 
Rabochaya 
Gazeta 
[5] 
during 
one 
of 
the 
unsuccessful 
attempts 
to 
revive 
that 
paper 
(see 
Chap. 
V). 
But 
the 
original 
plan 
to 
confine 
this 
pamphlet 
to 
an 
analysis 
of 
only 
these 
three 
questions 
and 
to 
set 
forth 
our 
views 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
in 
a 
positive 
form, 
without 
entering, 
or 
almost 
without 
entering, 
into 
polemics, 
proved 
quite 
impracticable 
for 
two 
reasons. 
One 
was 
that 
Economism 
proved 
to 
be 
much 
more 
tenacious 
than 
we 
had 
sup 
posed 
(we 
employ 
the 
term 
Economism 
in 
the 
broad 
sense, 
as 
explained 
in 
the 
Iskra, 
No. 
12 
[December 
1901], 
in 
an 
article 
entitled 
"A 
Conversation 
With 
the 
Advocates 
of 
Economism," 
which 
was 
a 
synopsis, 
so 
to 
speak, 
of 
the 
present 
pamphlet[6]). 
It 
became 
clear 
beyond 
doubt 
that 
the 
differences 
as 
to 
how 
these 
three 
questions 
should 
be 
answered 
were 
due 
much 
more 
to 
the 



fundamental 
antithesis 
between 
the 
two 
trends 
in 
the 
Russian 
Social-
Democratic 
movement 
than 
to 
differences 
over 
details. 
The 
second 
reason 
was 
that 
the 
perplexity 
displayed 
by 
the 
Economists 
over 
the 
practical 
application 
of 
our 
views 
in 
the 
Iskra 
revealed 
quite 
clearly 
that 
we 
often 
speak 
literally 
different 
languages, 
that 
therefore 
we 
cannot 
come 
to 
any 
understanding 
without 
beginning 
ab 
ovo, 
and 
that 
an 
attempt 
must 
be 
made, 
in 
the 
simplest 
possible 
style 
and 
illustrated 
by 
numerous 
and 
concrete 
examples, 
systematically 
to 
"thrash 
out" 
all 
our 
fundamental 
points 
of 
difference 
with 
all 
the 
Economists. 
I 
resolved 
to 
make 
such 
an 
attempt 
to 
"thrash 
out" 
the 
differences, 
fully 
realizing 
that 
it 
would 
greatly 
increase 
the 
size 
of 
the 
pamphlet 
and 
delay 
its 
publication, 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
I 
saw 
no 
other 
way 
of 
fulfilling 
the 
promise 
I 
made 
in 
the 
article 
"Where 
To 
Begin?" 
Thus, 
in 
addition 
to 
apologizing 
for 
the 
delay, 
I 
must 
apologize 
for 
the 
numerous 
literary 
shortcomings 
of 
the 
pamphlet. 
I 
had 
to 
work 
in 
the 
greatest 
of 
haste, 
and 
was 
moreover 
frequently 
interrupted 
by 
other 
work. 


The 
examination 
of 
the 
three 
questions 
mentioned 
above 
still 
constitutes 
the 
main 
theme 
of 
this 
pamphlet, 
but 
I 
found 
it 
necessary 
to 
begin 
with 
two 
questions 
of 
a 
more 
general 
nature, 
viz., 
why 
an 
"innocent" 
and 
"natural" 
slogan 
like 
"freedom 
of 
criticism" 
should 
be 
a 
real 
fighting 
challenge 
for 
us, 
and 
why 
we 
cannot 
come 
to 
an 
understanding 
even 
on 
the 
fundamental 
question 
of 
the 
role 
of 
Social-Democrats 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
spontaneous 
mass 
movement. 
Further, 
the 
exposition 
of 
our 
views 
on 
the 
character 
and 
substance 
of 
political 
agitation 
developed 
into 
an 
explanation 
of 
the 
difference 
between 
a 
trade-unionist 
policy 
and 
Social-Democratic 
policy, 
while 
the 
exposition 
of 
our 
views 
on 
organizational 
tasks 
developed 
into 
an 
explanation 
of 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
amateurish 
methods 
which 
satisfy 
the 
Economists, 
and 
an 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries 
which 
in 
our 
opinion 
is 
indispensable. 
Further, 
I 
advance 
the 
"plan" 
for 
an 
all-Russian 
political 
newspaper 
with 
all 
the 
more 
insistence 
because 
of 
the 
flimsiness 
of 
the 
objections 
raised 
against 
it, 
and 
because 
no 
real 
answer 
has 
been 
given 
to 
the 
question 
I 
raised 
in 
the 
article 
"Where 
To 
Begin?" 
as 
to 
how 
we 
can 
set 
to 
work 
from 
all 
sides 
simultaneously 
to 
erect 
the 
organization 
we 
need. 
Finally, 
in 
the 
concluding 
part 
of 
this 
pamphlet, 
I 
hope 
to 
show 
that 
we 
did 
all 
we 
could 
to 
prevent 
a 
decisive 
rupture 
with 
the 
Economists, 
which 
nevertheless 
proved 
inevitable; 
that 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
has 
acquired 
a 
special 
significance, 
a 
"historical" 
significance, 
if 
you 
will, 
because 
it 
most 
fully 
and 
most 
graphically 
expressed, 
not 
consistent 
Economism, 
but 
the 
confusion 
and 



vacillation 
which 
constitute 
the 
distinguishing 
feature 
of 
a 
whole 
period 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
Russian 
Social-Democratic 
movement; 
and 
that 
therefore 
the 
controversy 
with 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
which 
may 
at 
first 
sight 
seem 
to 
be 
waged 
in 
too 
excessive 
detail, 
also 
acquires 
significance, 
for 
we 
can 
make 
no 
progress 
until 
we 
finally 
put 
an 
end 
to 
this 
period.

Dogmatism 
And 
"Freedom 
Of 
Criticism" 

A. 
WHAT 
IS 
"FREEDOM 
OF 
CRITICISM"? 
"Freedom 
of 
criticism" 
is 
undoubtedly 
the 
most 
fashionable 
slogan 
at 
the 
present 
time, 
and 
the 
one 
most 
frequently 
employed 
in 
the 
controversies 
between 
the 
Socialists 
and 
democrats 
of 
all 
countries. 
At 
first 
sight, 
nothing 
would 
appear 
to 
be 
more 
strange 
than 
the 
solemn 
appeals 
by 
one 
of 
the 
parties 
to 
the 
dispute 
to 
freedom 
of 
criticism. 
Have 
voices 
been 
raised 
in 
the 
advanced 
parties 
against 
the 
constitutional 
law 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
European 
countries 
which 
guarantees 
freedom 
to 
science 
and 
scientific 
investigation? 
"Something 
must 
be 
wrong 
here," 
will 
be 
the 
comment 
of 
the 
onlooker, 
who 
has 
not 
yet 
fully 
grasped 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
disagreements 
among 
the 
disputants, 
but 
has 
heard 
this 
fashionable 
slogan 
repeated 
at 
every 
crossroad. 
"Evidently 
this 
slogan 
is 
one 
of 
the 
conventional 
phrases 
which, 
like 
a 
nickname, 
becomes 
legitimatized 
by 
use, 
and 
becomes 
almost 
an 
appellative," 
he 
will 
conclude. 


In 
fact, 
it 
is 
no 
secret 
that 
two 
trends 
have 
taken 
shape 
in 
the 
present-
day 
international[*] 
Social-Democracy. 
The 
fight 
between 
these 
trends 
now 
flares 
up 
in 
a 
bright 
flame, 
and 
now 
dies 
down 
and 
smoulders 
under 
the 
ashes 
of 
imposing 
"truce 
resolutions." 
What 
this 
"new" 
trend, 
which 
adopts 
a 
"critical" 
attitude 
towards 
"obsolete 
dogmatic" 
Marxism, 
represents 
has 
with 
sufficient 
precision 
been 
stated 
by 
Bernstein, 
and 
demonstrated 
by 
Millerand. 


Social-Democracy 
must 
change 
from 
a 
party 
of 
the 
social 
revolution 
into 
a 
democratic 
party 
of 
social 
reforms. 
Bernstein 
has 
surrounded 
this 
political 
demand 
with 
a 
whole 
battery 
of 
symmetrically 
arranged 
"new" 
arguments 
and 
reasonings. 
The 
possibility 
of 
putting 
Socialism 
on 
a 
scientific 
basis 
and 
of 
proving 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
materialist 
concep 
tion 
of 
history 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
and 
inevitable 
was 
denied, 
as 
was 
also 
the 
growing 
impoverishment, 
proletarianization 
and 
the 
intensification 
of 
capitalist 
contradictions. 
The 
very 
conception, 
"ultimate 
aim," 
was 
declared 
to 
be 
unsound, 
and 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat 
was 
abso


* 
Incidentally, 
this 
perhaps 
is 
the 
only 
occasion 
in 
the 
history 
of 
modern 
Socialism 
in 
which 
controversies 
between 
various 
trends 
within 
the 
socialist 
movement 
have 
grown 
from 
national 
into 
international 
controversies; 
and 
this, 
in 
its 
own 
way, 
is 
extremely 
encouraging. 
Formerly, 
the 
disputes 
between 
the 
Lassalleans 
and 
the 
Eisenachers,[7] 
between 
the 
Guesdites 
and 
the 
Possibilists,[8] 
between 
the 
Fabians[9] 
and 
the 
Social-Democrats, 
and 

between 
the 
Narodnaya 
Volya-ites[10] 
and 
Social-Democrats, 
remained 
purely 
national 
disputes, 
reflected 
purely 
national 
features 
and 
proceeded, 
as 
it 
were, 
on 
different 
planes. 
At 
the 
present 
time 
(this 
is 
quite 
evident 
now), 
the 
English 
Fabians, 
the 
French 
Ministerialists, 
the 
German 
Bernsteinians 
and 
the 
Russian 
critics 
--all 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
family, 
all 
extol 
each 
other, 
learn 
from 
each 
other, 
and 
together 
come 
out 
against 
"dogmatic" 
Marxism. 
Perhaps 
in 
this 
first 
really 
international 
battle 
with 
socialist 
opportunism, 
international 
revolutionary 
Social-Democracy 
will 
become 
sufficiently 
strengthened 
to 
put 
an 
end 
to 
the 
political 
reaction 
that 
has 
long 
reigned 
in 
Europe? 


lutely 
rejected. 
It 
was 
denied 
that 
there 
is 
any 
counter-distinction 
in 
principle 
between 
liberalism 
and 
Socialism. 
The 
theory 
of 
the 
class 
struggle 
was 
rejected 
on 
the 
grounds 
that 
it 
could 
not 
be 
applied 
to 
a 
strictly 
democratic 
society, 
governed 
according 
to 
the 
will 
of 
the 
majority, 
etc. 


Thus, 
the 
demand 
for 
a 
resolute 
turn 
from 
revolutionary 
Social-
Democracy 
to 
bourgeois 
social-reformism 
was 
accompanied 
by 
a 
no 
less 
resolute 
turn 
towards 
bourgeois 
criticism 
of 
all 
the 
fundamental 
ideas 
of 
Marxism. 
As 
this 
criticism 
of 
Marxism 
has 
been 
going 
on 
for 
a 
long 
time 
now, 
from 
the 
political 
platform, 
from 
university 
chairs, 
in 
numerous 
pamphlets 
and 
in 
a 
number 
of 
learned 
treatises, 
as 
the 
entire 
younger 
generation 
of 
the 
educated 
classes 
has 
been 
systematically 
trained 
for 
decades 
on 
this 
criticism, 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
the 
"new, 
critical" 
trend 
in 
Social-
Democracy 
should 
spring 
up, 
all 
complete, 
like 
Minerva 
from 
the 
head 
of 
Jupiter.[11] 
The 
content 
of 
this 
new 
trend 
did 
not 
have 
to 
grow 
and 
take 
shape, 
it 
was 
transferred 
bodily 
from 
bourgeois 
literature 
to 
socialist 
literature. 


To 
proceed. 
If 
Bernstein's 
theoretical 
criticism 
and 
political 
yearnings 
are 
still 
unclear 
to 
anyone, 
the 
French 
have 
taken 
the 
trouble 
graphically 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
"new 
method." 
In 
this 
instance, 
too, 
France 
has 
justified 
its 
old 
reputation 
of 
being 
the 
country 
in 
which 
"more 
than 
anywhere 
else, 
the 
historical 
class 
struggles 
were 
each 
time 
fought 
out 
to 
a 
decision. 
. 
. 
." 
(Engels, 
in 
his 
introduction[12] 
to 
Marx's 
The 
Eighteenth 
Brumaire.[13]) 
The 
French 
Socialists 
have 
begun, 
not 
to 
theorize, 
but 
to 
act. 
The 
democratically 
more 
highly 
developed 
political 
conditions 
in 
France 
have 
permitted 
them 
to 
put 
"Bernsteinism 
into 
practice" 
immediately, 
with 
all 
its 
consequences. 
Millerand 
has 
provided 
an 
excellent 
example 
of 
practical 
Bernsteinism; 
not 
without 
reason 
did 
Bernstein 
and 
Vollmar 
rush 
so 
zealously 
to 
defend 
and 
praise 
him 
I 
Indeed, 
if 
Social-Democracy, 
in 
essence, 
is 
merely 
a 
party 
of 



reform, 
and 
must 
be 
bold 
enough 
to 
admit 
this 
openly, 
then 
not 
only 
has 
a 
Socialist 
the 
right 
to 
join 
a 
bourgeois 
cabinet, 
but 
must 
always 
strive 
to 
do 
so. 
If 
democracy, 
in 
essence, 
means 
the 
abolition 
of 
class 
domination, 
then 
why 
should 
not 
a 
Socialist 
minister 
charm 
the 
whole 
bourgeois 
world 
by 
orations 
on 
class 
collaboration? 
Why 
should 
he 
not 
remain 
in 
the 
cabinet 
even 
after 
the 
shooting 
down 
of 
workers 
by 
gendarmes 
has 
exposed, 
for 
the 
hundredth 
and 
thousandth 
time, 
the 
real 
nature 
of 
the 
democratic 
collaboration 
of 
classes? 
Why 
should 
he 
not 
personally 
take 
part 
in 
greeting 
the 
tsar, 
for 
whom 
the 
French 
Socialists 
now 
have 
no 
other 
name 
than 
hero 
of 
the 
gallows, 
knout 
and 
exile 
(knouteur, 
pendeur 
et 
déportateur)? 
And 
the 
reward 
for 
this 
utter 
humiliation 
and 
self-degradation 
of 
Socialism 
in 
the 
face 
of 
the 
whole 
world, 
for 
the 
corruption 
of 
the 
socialist 
consciousness 
of 
the 
worker 
masses 
--the 
only 
basis 
that 
can 
guarantee 
our 
victory 
--the 
reward 
for 
this 
is 
pompous 
plans 
for 
niggardly 
reforms, 
so 
niggardly 
in 
fact 
that 
much 
more 
has 
been 
obtained 
from 
bourgeois 
governments! 


He 
who 
does 
not 
deliberately 
close 
his 
eyes 
cannot 
fail 
to 
see 
that 
the 
new 
"critical" 
trend 
in 
Socialism 
is 
nothing 
more 
nor 
less 
than 
a 
new 
variety 
of 
opportunism. 
And 
if 
we 
judge 
people 
not 
by 
the 
brilliant 
uniforms 
they 
don, 
not 
by 
the 
high-sounding 
appellations 
they 
give 
themselves, 
but 
by 
their 
actions, 
and 
by 
what 
they 
actually 
advocate, 
it 
will 
be 
clear 
that 
"freedom 
of 
criticism" 
means 
freedom 
for 
an 
opportunistic 
trend 
in 
Social-Democracy, 
the 
freedom 
to 
convert 
Social-Democracy 
into 
a 
democratic 
party 
of 
reform, 
the 
freedom 
to 
introduce 
bourgeois 
ideas 
and 
bourgeois 
elements 
into 
Socialism. 


"Freedom" 
is 
a 
grand 
word, 
but 
under 
the 
banner 
of 
free 
trade 
the 
most 
predatory 
wars 
were 
conducted; 
under 
the 
banner 
of 
free 
labour, 
the 
toilers 
were 
robbed. 
The 
modern 
use 
of 
the 
term 
"freedom 
of 
criticism" 
contains 
the 
same 
inherent 
falsehood. 
Those 
who 
are 
really 
convinced 
that 
they 
have 
advanced 
science 
would 
demand, 
not 
freedom 
for 
the 
new 
views 
to 
continue 
side 
by 
side 
with 
the 
old, 
but 
the 
substitution 
of 
the 
new 
views 
for 
the 
old. 
The 
cry 
"Long 
live 
freedom 
criticism," 
that 
is 
heard 
today, 
too 
strongly 
calls 
to 
mind 
the 
fable 
of 
the 
empty 
barrel.[14] 


We 
are 
marching 
in 
a 
compact 
group 
along 
a 
precipitous 
and 
difficult 
path, 
firmly 
holding 
each 
other 
by 
the 
hand. 
We 
are 
surrounded 
on 
all 
sides 
by 
enemies, 
and 
we 
have 
to 
advance 
under 
their 
almost 
constant 
fire. 
We 
have 
combined 
voluntarily, 
precisely 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
fighting 
the 
enemy, 
and 
not 
to 
retreat 
into 
the 
adjacent 
marsh, 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
which, 
from 
the 
very 
outset, 
have 
reproached 
us 
with 
having 
separated 
ourselves 
into 
an 



exclusive 
group 
and 
with 
having 
chosen 
the 
path 
of 
struggle 
instead 
of 
the 
path 
of 
conciliation. 
And 
now 
several 
among 
us 
begin 
to 
cry 
out: 
let 
us 
go 
into 
this 
marsh! 
And 
when 
we 
begin 
to 
shame 
them, 
they 
retort: 
how 
conservative 
you 
are! 
Are 
you 
not 
ashamed 
to 
deny 
us 
the 
liberty 
to 
invite 
you 
to 
take 
a 
better 
road! 
Oh, 
yes, 
gentlemen! 
You 
are 
free 
not 
only 
to 
invite 
us, 
but 
to 
go 
yourselves 
wherever 
you 
will, 
even 
into 
the 
marsh. 
In 
fact, 
we 
think 
that 
the 
marsh 
is 
your 
proper 
place, 
and 
we 
are 
prepared 
to 
render 
you 
every 
assistance 
to 
get 
there. 
Only 
let 
go 
of 
our 
hands, 
don't 
clutch 
at 
us 
and 
don't 
besmirch 
the 
grand 
word 
"freedom," 
for 
we 
too 
are 
"free" 
to 
go 
where 
we 
please, 
free 
to 
fight 
not 
only 
against 
the 
marsh, 
but 
also 
against 
those 
who 
are 
turning 
towards 
the 
marsh! 



B. 
THE 
NEW 
ADVOCATES 
OF 
"FREEDOM 
OF 
CRITICISM"! 
Now, 
this 
slogan 
("freedom 
of 
criticism") 
has 
been 
solemnly 
advanced, 
very 
recently, 
in 
No. 
10 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
the 
organ 
of 
the 
Union 
of 
Russian 
Social-Democrats 
Abroad,[15] 
not 
as 
a 
theoretical 
postulate, 
but 
as 
a 
political 
demand, 
as 
a 
reply 
to 
the 
question: 
"is 
it 
possible 
to 
unite 
the 
Social-
Democratic 
organizations 
operating 
abroad?" 
--"in 
order 
that 
unity 
may 
be 
durable, 
there 
must 
be 
freedom 
of 
criticism." 
(P. 
36.) 


From 
this 
statement 
two 
quite 
definite 
conclusions 
follow: 
1) 
that 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
has 
taken 
under 
its 
wing 
the 
opportunist 
trend 
in 
international 
Social-Democracy 
in 
general, 
and 
2) 
that 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
demands 
freedom 
for 
opportunism 
in 
Russian 
Social-Democracy. 
Let 
us 
examine 
these 
concluslons. 


The 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
is 
"particularly" 
displeased 
with 
the 
Iskra's 
and 
the 
Zarya's[16] 
"inclination 
to 
predict 
a 
rupture 
between 
the 
Mountain 
and 
the 
Gironde 
in 
international 
Social-Democracy."* 


"Generally 
speaking," 
writes 
B. 
Krichevsky, 
editor 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
"this 
talk 
about 
the 
Mountain 
and 
the 
Gironde 
that 
is 
heard 
in 


* 
A 
comparison 
between 
the 
two 
trends 
among 
the 
revolutionary 
proletariat 
(the 
revolutionary 
and 
the 
opportunist), 
and 
the 
two 
trends 
among 
the 
revolutionary 
bourgeoisie 
in 
the 
eighteenth 
century 
(the 
Jacobin, 
known 
as 
the 
Mountain, 
and 
the 
Girondist) 
was 
made 
in 
a 
leading 
article 
in 
No. 
2 
of 
the 
Iskra 
(February 
1901). 
This 
article 
was 
written 
by 
Plekhanov. 
The 
Cadets,[17] 
the 
Bezzaglavtsi[18] 
and 
the 
Mensheviks 
to 
this 
day 
love 
to 
refer 
to 
the 
Jacobinism 
in 
Russian 
Social-Democracy 
but 
they 
prefer 
to 
remain 
silent 
about, 
or 
. 
. 
. 
to 
forget 
the 
circumstance 
that 
Plekhanov 
used 
this 
term 
for 
the 
first 
time 
against 
the 
Right 
wing 
of 
Social-Democracy. 
(Author's 
note 
to 
the 
1907 
edition. 
--Ed.) 
the 
ranks 
of 
Social-Democracy 
represents 
a 
shallow 
historical 
analogy, 
a 
strange 
thing 
to 
come 
from 
the 
pen 
of 
a 
Marxist. 
The 
Mountain 
and 
the 
Gironde 
did 
not 
represent 
different 
temperaments, 
or 
intellectual 
trends, 
as 
ideologist 
historians 
may 
think, 
but 
different 
classes 
or 
strata 
--the 
middle 
bourgeoisie, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
the 
petty 
bourgeoisie 
and 
the 
proletariat, 
on 
the 
other. 
In 
the 
modern 
socialist 
movement, 
however, 
there 
is 
no 
conflict 
of 
class 
interests; 
the 
socialist 
movement 
in 
its 
entirety, 
all 
of 
its 
diverse 
forms," 


(B. 
K.'s 
italics) 
"including 
the 
most 
pronounced 
Bernsteinians, 
stand 
on 
the 

basis 
of 
the 
class 
interests 
of 
the 
proletariat 
and 
of 
its 
class 
struggle 
for 
political 
and 
economic 
emancipation." 
(Pp. 
32-33.) 


A 
bold 
assertion! 
Has 
not 
B. 
Krichevsky 
heard 
of 
the 
fact, 
long 
ago 
noted, 
that 
it 
is 
precisely 
the 
extensive 
participation 
of 
an 
"academic" 
stratum 
in 
the 
socialist 
movement 
in 
recent 
years 
that 
has 
secured 
such 
a 
rapid 
spread 
of 
Bernsteinism? 
And 
what 
is 
most 
important 
--on 
what 
does 
our 
author 
base 
his 
opinion 
that 
even 
"the 
most 
pronounced 
Bernsteinians" 
stand 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
class 
struggle 
for 
the 
political 
and 
economic 
emancipation 
of 
the 
proletariat? 
No 
one 
knows. 
This 
determined 
defence 
of 
the 
most 
pronounced 
Bernsteinians 
is 
not 
supported 
by 
any 
argument 
or 
ideas 
whatever. 
Apparently, 
the 
author 
believes 
that 
if 
he 
repeats 
what 
the 
most 
pronounced 
Bernsteinians 
say 
about 
themselves, 
his 
assertion 
requires 
no 
proof. 
But 
can 
anything 
more 
"shallow" 
be 
imagined 
than 
this 
opinion 
of 
a 
whole 
tendency 
based 
on 
nothing 
more 
than 
what 
the 
representatives 
of 
that 
tendency 
say 
about 
themselves? 
Can 
anything 
more 
shallow 
be 
imagined 
than 
the 
subsequent 
"homily" 
about 
the 
two 
different 
and 
even 
diametrically 
opposite 
types, 
or 
paths, 
of 
party 
development? 
(Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
pp. 
34-35.) 
The 
German 
Social-Democrats, 
you 
see, 
recognize 
complete 
freedom 
of 
criticism, 
but 
the 
French 
do 
not, 
and 
it 
is 
precisely 
their 
example 
that 
demonstrates 
all 
the 
"harmfulness 
of 
intolerance." 


To 
which 
we 
reply 
that 
the 
very 
example 
of 
B. 
Krichevsky 
proves 
that 
the 
name 
of 
Marxists 
is 
sometimes 
assumed 
by 
people 
who 
regard 
history 
literally 
from 
the 
''Ilovaisky''[19] 
point 
of 
view. 
To 
explain 
the 
unity 
of 
the 
German 
Socialist 
Party 
and 
the 
disunity 
of 
the 
French 
Socialist 
Party, 
there 
is 
no 
need 
whatever 
to 
go 
into 
the 
special 
features 
in 
the 
history 
of 
these 
countries, 
to 
contrast 
the 
conditions 
of 
military 
semiabsolutism 
in 
the 
one 
country 
with 
republican 
parliamentarism 
in 
the 
other, 
or 
to 
analyze 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
Paris 
Commune 
and 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
Anti-Socialist 
Law;[20] 
to 
compare 
the 
economic 
life 
and 
economic 
development 
of 
the 
two 
countries, 
or 
recall 
that 
"the 
unexampled 
growth 
of 
German 
Social-Democracy" 
was 
accompanied 
by 
a 
strenuous 
struggle, 
unexampled 
in 
the 
history 
of 
Socialism, 
not 
only 
against 
mistaken 
theories 
(Muhlberger, 
Duhring,* 
the 
Katheder-Socialists[22]), 
but 
also 
against 
mistaken 
tactics 
(Lassalle), 
etc., 
etc. 
All 
that 
is 
superfluous! 
The 
French 
quarrel 
among 
themselves 
because 
they 
are 
intolerant; 
the 
Germans 
are 
united 
because 
they 
are 
good 
boys. 


* 
At 
the 
time 
Engels 
dealt 
his 
blows 
at 
Duhring, 
many 
representatives 

of 
German 
Social-Democracy 
inclined 
towards 
the 
latter's 
views, 
and 
accusations 
of 
acerbity, 
intolerance, 
uncomradely 
polemics, 
etc., 
were 
even 
publicly 
hurled 
at 
Engels 
at 
the 
Party 
Congress. 
At 
the 
Congress 
of 
1877, 
Most, 
and 
his 
supporters, 
moved 
a 
resolution 
to 
prohibit 
the 
publication 
of 
Engels' 
articles 
in 
the 
Vorwärts 
[21] 
because 
"they 
do 
not 
interest 
the 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
the 
readers," 
and 
Wahlteich 
declared 
that 
the 
publication 
of 
these 
articles 
had 
caused 
great 
damage 
to 
the 
Party, 
that 
Duhring 
too 
had 
rendered 
services 
to 
Social-Democracy: 
"We 
must 
utilize 
everyone 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
the 
party; 
let 
the 
professors 
engage 
in 
polemics 
if 
they 
care 
to 
do 
so, 
but 
the 
Vorwärts 
is 
not 
the 
place 
in 
which 
to 
conduct 
them." 
(Vorwärts, 
No. 
65, 
June 
6, 
1877.) 
This, 
as 
you 
see, 
is 
another 
example 
of 
the 
defence 
of 
"freedom 
of 
criticism," 
and 
our 
legal 
critics 
and 
illegal 
opportunists, 
who 
love 
so 
much 
to 
cite 
the 
example 
of 
the 
Germans, 
would 
do 
well 
to 
ponder 
over 
it! 


And 
observe, 
this 
piece 
of 
matchless 
profundity 
is 
intended 
to 
"refute" 
the 
fact 
which 
is 
a 
complete 
answer 
to 
the 
defence 
of 
the 
Bernsteinians. 
The 
question 
as 
to 
whether 
the 
Bernsteinians 
do 
stand 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
class 
struggle 
of 
the 
proletariat 
can 
be 
completely 
and 
irrevocably 
answered 
only 
by 
historical 
experience. 
Consequently, 
the 
example 
of 
France 
is 
the 
most 
important 
one 
in 
this 
respect, 
because 
it 
is 
the 
only 
country 
in 
which 
the 
Bernsteinians 
attempted 
to 
stand 
independently, 
on 
their 
own 
feet, 
with 
the 
warm 
approval 
of 
their 
German 
colleagues 
(and 
partly 
also 
of 
the 
Russian 
opportunists; 
cf. 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No. 
2-3, 
pp. 
83-84). 
The 
reference 
to 
the 
"intolerance" 
of 
the 
French, 
apart 
from 
its 
"historical" 
significance 
(in 
the 
Nozdryov 
sense[23]), 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
merely 
an 
attempt 
to 
obscure 
very 
unpleasant 
facts 
with 
angry 
invectives. 


Nor 
are 
we 
at 
all 
prepared 
to 
make 
a 
present 
of 
the 
Germans 
to 
B. 
Krichevsky 
and 
to 
the 
numerous 
other 
champions 
of 
"freedom 
of 
criticism." 
If 
the 
"most 
pronounced 
Bernsteinians" 
are 
still 
tolerated 
in 
the 
ranks 
of 
the 
German 
party, 
it 
is 
only 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
they 
submit 
to 
the 
Hanover 
resolution,[24] 
which 
emphatically 
rejected 
Bernstein's 
"amendments," 
and 
to 
the 
Lubeck 
resolution,[25] 
which 
(notwithstanding 
the 
diplomatic 
terms 
in 
which 
it 
is 
couched) 
contains 
a 
direct 
warning 
to 
Bernstein. 
It 
is 
debatable, 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
German 
party, 
whether 
diplomacy 
was 
appropriate 
and 
whether, 
in 
this 
case, 
a 
bad 
peace 
is 
better 
than 
a 
good 
quarrel; 
in 
short, 
opinions 
may 
differ 
as 
to 
the 
expediency 
of 
one 
or 
another 
method 
employed 
to 
reject 
Bernsteinism, 
but 
that 
the 
German 
party 
did 



reject 
Bernsteinism 
on 
two 
occasions 
is 
a 
fact 
no 
one 
can 
fail 
to 
see. 
Therefore, 
to 
think 
that 
the 
German 
example 
confirms 
the 
thesis: 
"The 
most 
pronounced 
Bernsteinians 
stand 


on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
class 
struggle 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
for 
political 
and 
economic 
emancipation," 
means 
failing 
absolutely 
to 
understand 
what 
is 
going 
on 
before 
everybody's 
eyes.[*] 


Nor 
is 
that 
all. 
As 
we 
have 
already 
observed, 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
demands 
"freedom 
of 
criticism," 
and 
defends 
Bernsteinism 
before 
Russian 
Social-Democracy. 
Apparently 
it 
came 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
we 
were 
unfair 
to 
our 
"critics" 
and 
the 
Bernsteinians. 
Which 
ones? 
Who 
was 
unfair? 
Where 
and 
when? 
What 
was 
the 
unfairness? 
About 
this 
not 
a 
word. 
The 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
does 
not 
name 
a 
single 
Russian 
critic 
or 
Bernsteinian! 
All 
that 
is 
left 
for 
us 
to 
do 
is 
to 
make 
one 
of 
two 
possible 
suppositions: 
Either, 
that 
the 
unfairly 
treated 
party 
is 
none 
other 
than 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
itself 
(and 
this 
is 
confirmed 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
the 
two 
articles 
in 
No. 
10 
reference 
is 
made 
only 
to 
the 
wrongs 
suffered 
by 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
at 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
Zarya 


* 
It 
should 
be 
observed 
that 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
has 
always 
confined 
itself 
to 
a 
bare 
statement 
of 
facts 
concerning 
Bernsteinism 
in 
the 
German 
party, 
and 
completely 
"refrained" 
from 
expressing 
its 
own 
opinion 
on 
these 
facts. 
See, 
for 
example, 
the 
reports 
of 
the 
Stuttgart 
Congress[26] 
in 
No. 
2-3 
(p. 
66), 
in 
which 
all 
the 
disagreements 
are 
reduced 
to 
disagreements 
over 
"tactics," 
and 
the 
bare 
statement 
is 
made 
that 
the 
overwhelming 
majority 
remain 
true 
to 
the 
previous 
revolutionary 
tactics. 
Or 
take 
No. 
4-5 
(p. 
25 
et 
seq.), 
in 
which 
we 
have 
a 
bare 
paraphrasing 
of 
the 
speeches 
delivered 
at 
the 
Hanover 
Congress, 
and 
a 
reprint 
of 
the 
resolution 
moved 
by 
Bebel. 
An 
exposition 
and 
criticism 
of 
Bernstein's 
views 
is 
again 
put 
off 
(as 
was 
the 
case 
in 
No. 
2-3) 
to 
be 
dealt 
with 
in 
a 
"special 
article." 
Curiously 
enough, 
in 
No. 
45 
(p. 
33), 
we 
read 
the 
following: 
". 
. 
. 
the 
views 
expounded 
by 
Bebel 
have 
the 
support 
of 
the 
enormous 
majority 
of 
the 
congress," 
and 
a 
few 
lines 
lower: 
". 
. 
. 
David 
defended 
Bernstein's 
views. 
. 
. 
. 
First 
of 
all, 
he 
tried 
to 
show 
that 
. 
. 
. 
Bernstein 
and 
his 
friends, 
after 
all 
is 
said 
and 
done," 
(sic!) 
stand 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
class 
struggle. 
. 
. 
." 
This 
was 
written 
in 
December 
1899, 
and 
in 
September 
1901 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
apparently 
having 
lost 
faith 
in 
the 
correctness 
of 
Bebel's 
position, 
repeats 
David's 
views 
as 
its 
own! 
and 
the 
Iskra). 
If 
that 
is 
the 
case, 
how 
is 
the 
strange 
fact 
to 
be 
explained 
that 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
which 
always 
vehemently 
dissociates 
itself 
from 



all 
solidarity 
with 
Bernsteinism, 
could 
not 
defend 
itself, 
without 
putting 
in 
a 
word 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
"most 
pronounced 
Bernsteinians" 
and 
of 
freedom 
of 
criticism? 
Or 
some 
third 
persons 
have 
been 
treated 
unfairly. 
If 
this 
is 
the 
case, 
then 
what 
reasons 
may 
there 
be 
for 
not 
naming 
them? 


We 
see, 
therefore, 
that 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
is 
continuing 
to 
play 
the 
game 
of 
hide-and-seek 
that 
it 
has 
played 
(as 
we 
shall 
show 
further 
on) 
ever 
since 
it 
commenced 
publication. 
And 
note 
this 
first 
practical 
application 
of 
the 
much 
vaunted 
"freedom 
of 
criticism." 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
not 
only 
was 
it 
forthwith 
reduced 
to 
abstention 
from 
all 
criticism, 
but 
also 
to 
abstention 
from 
expressing 
independent 
views 
altogether. 
The 
very 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
which 
avoids 
mentioning 
Russian 
Bernsteinism 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
shameful 
disease 
(to 
use 
Starover's[27] 
apt 
expression) 
proposes, 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
this 
disease, 
to 
copy 
word 
for 
word 
the 
latest 
German 
prescription 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
the 
German 
variety 
of 
the 
disease! 
Instead 
of 
freedom 
of 
criticism 
--slavish 
(worse: 
monkeylike) 
imitation. 
The 
very 
same 
social 
and 
political 
content 
of 
modern 
international 
opportunism 
reveals 
itself 
in 
a 
variety 
of 
ways 
according 
to 
its 
national 
peculiarities. 
In 
one 
country 
the 
opportunists 
long 
ago 
came 
out 
under 
a 
separate 
flag, 
in 
another 
they 
ignored 
theory 
and 
in 
practice 
pursued 
the 
policy 
of 
the 
Radical-Socialists; 
in 
a 
third 
country, 
several 
members 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
party 
have 
deserted 
to 
the 
camp 
of 
opportunism 
and 
strive 
to 
achieve 
their 
aims 
not 
by 
an 
open 
struggle 
for 
principles 
and 
for 
new 
tactics, 
but 
by 
gradual, 
imperceptible 
and, 
if 
one 
may 
so 
express 
it, 
unpunishable 
corruption 
of 
their 
party. 
In 
a 


fourth 
country 
again, 
similar 
deserters 
employ 
the 
same 
methods 
in 
the 
gloom 
of 
political 
slavery, 
and 
with 
an 
absolutely 
unique 
combination 
of 
"legal" 
with 
"illegal" 
activity, 
etc., 
etc. 
To 
talk 
about 
freedom 
of 
criticism 
and 
Bernsteinism 
as 
a 
condition 
for 
uniting 
the 
Russian 
Social-Democrats, 
and 
not 
to 
explain 
how 
Russian 
Bernsteinism 
has 
manifested 
itself, 
and 
what 
particular 
fruits 
it 
has 
borne, 
is 
tantamount 
to 
talking 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
saying 
nothing. 


Let 
us 
ourselves 
try, 
if 
only 
in 
a 
few 
words, 
to 
say 
what 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
did 
not 
want 
to 
say 
(or 
perhaps 
did 
not 
even 
understand). 



C. 
CRITICISM 
IN 
RUSSIA 
The 
chief 
distinguishing 
feature 
of 
Russia 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
point 
we 
are 
examining 
is 
that 
the 
very 
beginning 
of 
the 
spontaneous 
working-class 
movement, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
the 
change 
of 
progressive 
public 
opinion 
towards 
Marxism 
on 
the 
other, 
was 
marked 
by 
the 
combination 
of 
obviously 
heterogeneous 
elements 
under 
a 
common 
flag 
for 
the 
purpose 
also 
of 
fighting 
a 
common 
enemy 
(an 
obsolete 
social 
and 
political 
world 
outlook). 
We 
refer 
to 
the 
heyday 
of 
"legal 
Marxism." 
Speaking 
generally, 
this 
was 
an 
altogether 
curious 
phenomenon 
that 
no 
one 
in 
the 
'eighties 
or 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
'nineties 
would 
have 
believed 
possible. 
In 
a 
country 
ruled 
by 
an 
autocracy, 
in 
which 
the 
press 
is 
completely 
shackled, 
and 
in 
a 
period 
of 
terrific 
political 
reaction 
in 
which 
even 
the 
tiniest 
outgrowth 
of 
political 
discontent 
and 
protest 
was 
persecuted, 
the 
theory 
of 
revolutionary 
Marxism 
suddenly 
forces 
its 
way 
into 
the 
censored 
literature, 
and 
though 
expounded 
in 
Aesopian 
language, 
is 


understood 
by 
the 
"interested." 
The 
government 
had 
accus 
tomed 
itself 
to 
regarding 
only 
the 
theory 
of 
(revolutionary) 
Narodnaya 
Volya-ism 
as 
dangerous, 
without, 
as 
is 
usually 
the 
case, 
observing 
its 
internal 
evolution, 
and 
rejoicing 
at 
any 
criticism 
levelled 
against 
it. 
Quite 
a 
considerable 
time 
elapsed 
(according 
to 
our 
Russian 
calculations) 
before 
the 
government 
realized 
what 
had 
happened 
and 
the 
unwieldy 
army 
of 
censors 
and 
gendarmes 
discovered 
the 
new 
enemy 
and 
flung 
itself 
upon 
him. 
Meanwhile, 
Marxist 
books 
were 
published 
one 
after 
another, 
Marxist 
journals 
and 
newspapers 
were 
founded, 
nearly 
everyone 
became 
a 
Marxist, 
Marxists 
were 
flattered, 
Marxists 
were 
courted 
and 
the 
book 
publishers 
rejoiced 
at 
the 
extraordinary, 
ready 
sale 
of 
Marxist 
literature. 
It 
was 
quite 
natural, 
therefore, 
that 
among 
the 
Marxist 
novices 
who 
were 
caught 
in 
this 
atmosphere, 
there 
should 
be 
more 
than 
one 
"author 
who 
got 
a 
swelled 
head. 
. 
. 
."[28] 


We 
can 
now 
speak 
calmly 
of 
this 
period 
as 
of 
an 
event 
of 
the 
past. 
It 
is 
no 
secret 
that 
the 
brief 
period 
in 
which 
Marxism 
blossomed 
on 
the 
surface 
of 
our 
literature 
was 
called 
forth 
by 
an 
alliance 
between 
people 
of 
extreme 
and 
of 
very 
moderate 
views. 
In 
point 
of 
fact, 
the 
latter 
were 
bourgeois 
democrats; 
and 
this 
was 
the 
conclusion 
(so 
strik 
ingly 
confirmed 
by 
their 
subsequent 
"critical" 
development) 
that 
suggested 
itself 
to 
some 
people 
even 
when 
the 
"alliance" 
was 
still 
intact.* 



That 
being 
the 
case, 
does 
not 
the 
responsibility 
for 
the 
subsequent 
"confusion" 
rest 
mainly 
upon 
the 
revolutionary 


* 
This 
refers 
to 
an 
article 
by 
K. 
Tulin 
(Lenin 
--Ed.) 
written 
against 
Struve: 
(See 
Lenin, 
Collected 
Works, 
4th 
Russ. 
ed., 
Vol. 
I, 
pp. 
315-484. 
-Ed.) 
The 
article 
was 
compiled 
from 
an 
essay 
entitled 
"The 
Reflection 
of 
Marxism 
in 
Bourgeois 
Literature." 
(Author's 
note 
to 
the 
l907 
edition. 
--Ed.) 
[Transcriber's 
Note: 
See 
note 
[29]. 
--DJR] 
Social-Democrats 
who 
entered 
into 
the 
alliance 
with 
the 
future 
"critics"? 
This 
question, 
together 
with 
a 
reply 
in 
the 
affirmative, 
is 
sometimes 
heard 
from 
people 
with 
excessively 
rigid 
views. 
But 
these 
people 
are 
absolutely 
wrong. 
Only 
those 
who 
are 
not 
sure 
of 
themselves 
can 
fear 
to 
enter 
into 
temporary 
alliances 
even 
with 
unreliable 
people; 
not 
a 
single 
political 
party 
could 
exist 
without 
such 
alliances. 
The 
combination 
with 
the 
"legal 
Marxists" 
was 
in 
its 
way 
the 
first 
really 
political 
alliance 
entered 
into 
by 
Russian 
Social-
Democrats. 
Thanks 
to 
this 
alliance, 
an 
astonishingly 
rapid 
victory 
was 
obtained 
over 
Narodism, 
and 
Marxist 
ideas 
(even 
though 
in 
a 
vulgarized 
form) 
became 
very 
widespread. 
More 
over, 
the 
alliance 
was 
not 
concluded 
altogether 
without 
"conditions." 
The 
proof: 
the 
burning 
by 
the 
censor, 
in 
1895, 
of 
the 
Marxist 
symposium, 
Materials 
on 
the 
Problem 
of 
the 
Economic 
Development 
of 
Russia.[29] 
If 
the 
literary 
agreement 
with 
the 
"legal 
Marxists" 
can 
be 
compared 
with 
a 
political 
alliance, 
then 
that 
book 
can 
be 
compared 
with 
a 
political 
treaty. 


The 
rupture, 
of 
course, 
did 
not 
occur 
because 
the 
"allies" 
proved 
to 
be 
bourgeois 
democrats. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
representatives 
of 
the 
latter 
trend 
are 
natural 
and 
desirable 
allies 
of 
Social-Democracy 
in 
so 
far 
as 
its 
democratic 
tasks, 
brought 
to 
the 
front 
by 
the 
prevailing 
situation 
in 
Russia, 
are 
concerned. 
But 
an 
essential 
condition 
for 
such 
an 
alliance 
must 
be 
the 
full 
opportunity 
for 
the 
Socialists 
to 
reveal 
to 
the 
working 
class 
that 
its 
interests 
are 
diametrically 
opposed 
to 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
However, 
the 
Bernsteinian 
and 
"critical" 
trend, 
to 
which 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
"legal 
Marxists" 
turned, 
deprived 
the 
Socialists 
of 
this 
opportunity 
and 
corrupted 
socialist 
consciousness 
by 
vulgarizing 
Marxism, 
by 
advocating 
the 
theory 
that 
social 
antag


onisms 
were 
being 
toned 
down, 
by 
declaring 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
social 
revolution 
and 
of 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat 
to 
be 
absurd, 
by 
reducing 
the 
working-class 
movement 
and 
the 
class 
struggle 
to 
narrow 
trade 
unionism 
and 
to 
a 
"realistic" 
struggle 
for 
petty, 
gradual 
reforms. 
This 
was 
tantamount 



to 
bourgeois 
democracy 
denying 
Socialism's 
right 
to 
independence 
and, 
consequently, 
of 
its 
right 
to 
existence; 
in 
practice 
it 
meant 
a 
striving 
to 
convert 
the 
nascent 
working-class 
movement 
into 
an 
appendage 
of 
the 
liberals. 


Naturally, 
under 
such 
circumstances 
a 
rupture 
was 
necessary. 
But 
the 
"peculiar" 
feature 
of 
Russia 
manifested 
itself 
in 
that 
this 
rupture 
simply 
meant 
the 
elimination 
of 
the 
Social-Democrats 
from 
the 
most 
accessible 
and 
widespread 
"legal" 
literature. 
The 
"ex-Marxists" 
who 
took 
up 
the 
flag 
of 
"criticism," 
and 
who 
obtained 
almost 
a 
monopoly 
of 
"demolishing" 
Marxism, 
entrenched 
themselves 
in 
this 
literature. 
Catchwords 
like: 
"Against 
orthodoxy" 
and 
"Long 
live 
freedom 
of 
criticism" 
(now 
repeated 
by 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
) 
immediately 
became 
the 
fashion, 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
neither 
the 
censor 
nor 
the 
gendarmes 
could 
resist 
this 
fashion 
is 
apparent 
from 
the 
publication 
of 
three 
Russian 
editions 
of 
Bernstein's 
celebrated 
book 
(celebrated 
in 
the 
Herostratus 
sense)[30] 
and 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
books 
by 
Bernstein, 
Mr. 
Prokopovich 
and 
others 
were 
recommended 
by 
Zubatov. 


[31] 
(Iskra, 
No. 
10.) 
Upon 
the 
Social-Democrats 
was 
now 
imposed 
a 
task 
that 
was 
difficult 
in 
itself, 
and 
made 
incredibly 
more 
difficult 
by 
purely 
external 
obstacles, 
viz., 
the 
task 
of 
combating 
the 
new 
trend. 
And 
this 
trend 
did 
not 
confine 
itself 
to 
the 
sphere 
of 
literature. 
The 
turn 
towards 
"criticism" 
was 
accompanied 
by 
the 
inclination 
towards 
"Economism" 
among 
Social-
Democratic 
practical 
workers. 
The 
manner 
in 
which 
the 
connection 
between, 
and 
inter-dependence 
of, 
legal 
criticism 
and 
illegal 
Economism 
arose 
and 
grew 
is 
an 
interesting 
subject 
in 
itself, 
and 
could 
serve 
as 
the 
subject 
of 
a 
special 
article. 
We 
need 
only 
note 
here 
that 
this 
connection 
undoubtedly 
existed. 
The 
notoriety 
deservedly 
acquired 
by 
the 
Credo 
was 
due 
precisely 
to 
the 
frankness 
with 
which 
it 
formulated 
this 
connection 
and 
blurted 
out 
the 
fundamental 
political 
tendency 
of 
"Economism," 
viz., 
let 
the 
workers 
carry 
on 
the 
economic 
struggle 
(it 
wouid 
be 
more 
correct 
to 
say 
the 
trade-unionist 
struggle, 
because 
the 
later 
also 
embraces 
specifically 
working-class 
politics), 
and 
let 
the 
Marxist 
intelligentsia 
merge 
with 
the 
liberals 
for 
the 
political 
"struggle." 
Thus, 
trade-
unionist 
work 
"among 
the 
people" 
meant 
fuifilling 
the 
first 
part 
of 
this 
task, 
and 
legal 
criticism 
meant 
fuifilling 
the 
second 
part. 
This 
statement 
was 
such 
an 
excellent 
weapon 
against 
Economism 
that, 
had 
there 
been 
no 
Credo, 
it 
would 
have 
been 
worth 
inventing. 


The 
Credo 
was 
not 
invented, 
but 
it 
was 
published 
without 
the 
consent 



and 
perhaps 
even 
against 
the 
will 
of 
its 
authors. 
At 
all 
events 
the 
present 
writer, 
who 
took 
part 
in 
dragging 
this 
new 
"program" 
into 
the 
light 
of 
day,* 
has 
heard 
complaints 
and 
reproaches 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
copies 
of 
the 
résumé 
of 
the 
speakers 
were 
distributed, 
dubbed 
the 
Credo, 
and 
even 
published 
in 
the 
press 
together 
with 
the 
protest! 
We 
refer 
to 
this 
episode 
because 
it 
reveals 
a 
very 
peculiar 
feature 
of 


* 
Reference 
is 
to 
the 
Protest 
of 
the 
Seventeen[32] 
against 
the 
Credo. 
The 
present 
writer 
took 
part 
in 
drawing 
up 
this 
protest 
(the 
end 
of 
1899). 
The 
protest 
and 
the 
Credo 
were 
published 
abroad 
in 
the 
spring 
of 
1900. 
(See 
Lenin, 
Collected 
Works, 
4th 
Russ. 
ed., 
Vol. 
IV, 
pp. 
149-63. 
--Ed.) 
It 
is 
now 
known 
from 
the 
article 
written 
by 
Madame 
Kuskova, 
I 
think 
in 
Byloye, 
[33] 
that 
she 
was 
the 
author 
of 
the 
Credo, 
and 
that 
Mr. 
Prokopovich 
was 
very 
prominent 
among 
the 
"Economists" 
abroad 
at 
that 
time. 
(Author's 
note 
to 
the 
1907 
edition. 
--Ed.) 
our 
Economists, 
viz., 
a 
fear 
of 
publicity. 
This 
is 
a 
feature 
of 
Economism 
generally, 
and 
not 
of 
the 
authors 
of 
the 
Credo 
alone. 
It 
was 
revealed 
by 
that 
most 
outspoken 
and 
honest 
advocate 
of 
Economism, 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl, 


[34] 
and 
by 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
(which 
was 
indignant 
over 
the 
publication 
of 
"Economist" 
documents 
in 
the 
Vademecum[35]), 
as 
well 
as 
by 
the 
Kiev 
Committee, 
which 
two 
years 
ago 
refused 
to 
permit 
the 
publication 
of 
its 
profession 
de 
foi,[36] 
together 
with 
a 
repudiation 
of 
it,[*] 
and 
by 
many, 
many 
other 
individual 
representatives 
of 
Economism. 
This 
fear 
of 
criticism 
being 
displayed 
by 
the 
advocates 
of 
freedom 
of 
criticism 
cannot 
be 
attributed 
solely 
to 
craftiness 
(although, 
on 
occasion, 
no 
doubt 
craftiness 
has 
something 
to 
do 
with 
it: 
it 
would 
be 
unwise 
to 
expose 
the 
young 
and 
as 
yet 
frail 
shoots 
of 
the 
new 
trend 
to 
attacks 
by 
opponents). 
No, 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
Economists 
quite 
sincerely 
disapprove 
(and 
by 
the 
very 
nature 
of 
Economism 
they 
must 
disapprove) 
of 
all 
theoretical 
controversies, 
factional 
disagreements, 
broad 
political 
questions, 
schemes 
for 
organizing 
revolutionaries, 
etc. 
"Leave 
all 
that 
to 
the 
people 
abroad!" 
said 
a 
fairly 
consistent 
Economist 
to 
me 
one 
day, 
and 
thereby 
he 
expressed 
a 
very 
widespread 
(and 
again 
a 
purely 
trade-unionist) 
view: 
our 
work, 
he 
said, 
is 
the 
working-class 
movement, 
the 
workers' 
organizations, 
here, 
in 
our 
parts; 
all 
the 
rest 
are 
merely 
the 
inventions 
of 
doctrinaires, 
an 
"exaggeration 
of 
the 
importace 
of 
ideology," 
as 
the 
authors 
of 
the 
letter, 
published 
in 
the 
Iskra, 
No. 
12, 
expressed 
it, 
in 
unison 
with 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No. 
10. 


The 
question 
now 
arises: 
such 
being 
the 
peculiar 
features 
of 
Russian 



"criticism" 
and 
Russian 
Bernsteinism, 
what 
should 


* 
As 
far 
as 
our 
information 
goes, 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
Kiev 
Committee 
has 
changed 
since 
then. 
have 
been 
the 
task 
of 
those 
who 
desired 
to 
oppose 
opportunism, 
in 
deeds 
and 
not 
merely 
in 
words? 
First 
of 
all, 
they 
should 
have 
made 
efforts 
to 
resume 
the 
theoretical 
work 
that 
the 
period 
of 
"legal 
Marxism" 
had 
only 
just 
begun, 
and 
that 
has 
now 
again 
fallen 
on 
the 
shoulders 
of 
the 
illegal 
workers. 
Without 
such 
work 
the 
successful 
growth 
of 
the 
movement 
was 
impossible. 
Secondly, 
they 
should 
have 
actively 
combated 
legal 
"criticism" 
that 
was 
greatly 
corrupting 
people's 
minds. 
Thirdly, 
they 
should 
have 
actively 
opposed 
confusion 
and 
vacillation 
in 
the 
practical 
movement, 
exposing 
and 
repudiating 
every 
conscious 
or 
unconscious 
attempt 
to 
degrade 
our 
program 
and 
tactics. 


That 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
did 
none 
of 
these 
things 
is 
well 
known, 
and 
further 
on 
we 
shall 
deal 
in 
detail 
with 
this 
well-known 
fact 
from 
various 
aspects. 
At 
the 
moment, 
however, 
we 
desire 
merely 
to 
show 
what 
a 
glaring 
contradiction 
there 
is 
between 
the 
demand 
for 
"freedom 
of 
criticism" 
and 
the 
specific 
features 
of 
our 
native 
criticism 
and 
Russian 
Economism. 
Indeed, 
glance 
at 
the 
text 
of 
the 
resolution 
in 
which 
the 
Union 
of 
Russian 
Social-
Democrats 
Abroad 
endorsed 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo. 


"In 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
further 
ideological 
development 
of 
Social-
Democracy, 
we 
recognize 
the 
freedom 
to 
criticize 
Social-Democratic 
theory 
in 
Party 
literature 
to 
be 
absolutely 
necessary 
in 
so 
far 
as 
this 
criticism 
does 
not 
run 
counter 
to 
the 
class 
and 
revolutionary 
character 
of 
this 
theory." 
(Two 
Congresses, 
p. 
10.) 


And 
the 
argumentation? 
The 
resolution 
"in 
its 
first 
part 
coincides 
with 
the 
resolution 
of 
the 
Lübeck 
Party 
Congress 
on 
Bernstein. 
. 
. 
. 
" 
In 
the 
simplicity 
of 
their 
souls 
the 
"Unionists" 
failed 
to 
observe 
what 
a 
testimonium 
paupertatis 
(certificate 
of 
poverty) 
they 
give 
themselves 
by 
this 
piece 
of 
imitativeness. 
. 
. 
. 
"But 
. 
. 
. 
in 
its 
second 
part, 
it 
restricts 


freedom 
of 
criticism 
much 
more 
than 
did 
the 
Lübeck 
Party 
Congress." 


So 
the 
Union's 
resolution 
was 
directed 
against 
the 
Russian 
Bernsteinians? 
If 
it 
was 
not, 
then 
the 
reference 
to 
Lübeck 
would 
be 
utterly 
absurd! 
But 
it 
is 
not 
true 
to 
say 
that 
it 
"restricts 
freedom 
of 
criticism." 
In 
passing 
their 
Hanover 
resolution, 
the 
Germans, 
point 
by 
point, 
rejected 
precisely 
the 
amendments 
proposed 
by 
Bernstein, 
while 
in 
their 
Lübeck 
resolution 
they 
cautioned 
Bernstein 
personally, 
by 
naming 
him 
in 
the 



resolution. 
Our 
"free" 
imitators, 
however, 
do 
not 
make 
a 
single 
allusion 
to 
a 
single 
manifestation 
of 
Russian 
"criticism" 
and 
Russian 
Economism 
and, 
in 
view 
of 
this 
omission, 
the 
bare 
reference 
to 
the 
class 
and 
revolutionary 
character 
of 
the 
theory 
leaves 
far 
wider 
scope 
for 
misinter 
pretation, 
particularly 
when 
the 
Union 
refuses 
to 
identify 
"so-called 
Economism" 
with 
opportunism. 
(Two 
Congresses, 
p. 
8, 
par. 
I.) 
But 
all 
this 
en 
passant. 
The 
main 
thing 
to 
note 
is 
that 
the 
opportunist 
attitude 
towards 
revolutionary 
Social-
Democrats 
in 
Russia 
is 
the 
very 
opposite 
of 
that 
in 
Germany. 
In 
that 
country, 
as 
we 
know, 
revolutionary 
Social-Democrats 
are 
in 
favour 
of 
preserving 
what 
is: 
the 
old 
program 
and 
tactics 
which 
are 
universally 
known, 
and 
have 
been 
elucidated 
in 
all 
their 
details 
by 
many 
decades 
of 
experience. 
The 
"critics" 
want 
to 
introduce 
changes, 
and 
as 
these 
critics 
represent 
an 
insignificant 
minority, 
and 
as 
they 
are 
very 
timid 
in 
their 
revisionist 
efforts, 
one 
can 
understand 
the 
motives 
of 
the 
majority 
in 
confining 
themselves 
to 
the 
dry 
rejection 
of 
"innovations." 
In 
Russia, 
however, 
it 
is 
the 
critics 
and 
Economists 
who 
are 
in 
favour 
of 
preserving 
what 
is: 
the 
"critics" 
want 
us 
to 
continue 
to 
regard 
them 
as 
Marxists, 
and 
to 
guarantee 
them 
the 
"freedom 
of 
criticism" 
which 
they 
enjoyed 
to 
the 
full 
(for, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
they 


never 
recognized 
any 
kind 
of 
Party 
ties,[*] 
and, 
moreover, 
we 
never 
had 
a 
generally 
recognized 
Party 
body 
which 
could 
"restrict 
freedom" 
of 
criticism, 
if 
only 
by 
council); 
the 
Economists 
want 
the 
revolutionaries 
to 
recognize 
the 
"sovereign 
character 
of 
the 
present 
movement" 
(Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No. 
10, 
p. 
25), 
i.e., 
to 
recognize 
the 
"legitimacy" 
of 
what 
exists; 
they 
want 
the 
"ideologists" 
not 
to 
try 
to 
"divert" 
the 
movement 
from 
the 
path 
that 
"is 
determined 
by 
the 
interaction 
of 
material 
elements 
and 
material 
environment" 
("Letter" 
published 
in 
the 
Iskra, 
No. 
12); 
they 
want 
recognition 
for 
the 
struggle 
"that 
is 
at 
all 
possible 
for 
the 
workers 
under 
the 
present 
conditions," 
and, 
as 
the 
only 
possible 
struggle, 
the 
one 
"they 
are 
actually 
conducting 
at 
the 
present 
time." 
(Special 
Supplement 
to 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl, 


[37] 
p. 
14.) 
We 
revolutionary 
Social-Democrats, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
are 
dissatisfied 
with 
this 
worshipping 
of 
spontaneity, 
i.e., 
worshipping 
what 
is 
"at 
the 
present 
moment": 
we 
demand 
that 
the 
tactics 
that 
have 
prevailed 
in 
recent 
years 
be 
changed; 
we 
declare 
* 
The 
very 
absence 
of 
public 
Party 
ties 
and 
Party 
traditions 
marks 
such 
a 
cardinal 
difference 
between 
Russia 
and 
Germany 
that 
it 
should 
have 
warned 
all 
sensible 
Socialists 
against 
blind 
imitation. 
But 
here 
is 
an 
example 
of 
the 
lengths 
to 
which 
"freedom 
of 
criticism" 
goes 
in 
Russia. 
Mr. 
Bulgakov, 
the 

Russian 
critic, 
utters 
the 
following 
reprimand 
to 
the 
Austrian 
critic, 
Hertz: 
"Notwithstanding 
the 
independence 
of 
his 
conclusions, 
Hertz, 
on 
this 
point" 
(on 
cooperative 
societies) 
"apparently 
remains 
excessively 
tied 
by 
the 
opinions 
of 
his 
Party, 
and 
although 
he 
disagrees 
with 
it 
in 
details, 
he 
dare 
not 
reject 
the 
common 
principle." 
(Capitalism 
and 
Agriculture, 
Vol. 
II, 
p. 
287.) 
The 
subject 
of 
a 
politically 
enslaved 
state, 
in 
which 
nine 
hundred 
and 
ninety-
nine 
out 
of 
a 
thousand 
of 
the 
population 
are 
corrupted 
to 
the 
marrow 
of 
their 
bones 
by 
political 
subservience, 
and 
completely 
lack 
the 
conception 
of 
Party 
honour 
and 
Party 
ties, 
superciliously 
reprimands 
a 
citizen 
of 
a 
constitutional 
state 
for 
being 
excessively 
"tied 
by 
the 
opinion 
of 
his 
Party"! 
Our 
illegal 
organizations 
have 
nothing 
else 
to 
do, 
of 
course, 
but 
draw 
up 
resolutions 
about 
freedom 
of 
criticism. 
. 
. 
. 


that 
"before 
we 
can 
unite, 
and 
in 
order 
that 
we 
may 
unite, 
we 
must 
first 
of 
all 
draw 
hrm 
and 
definite 
lines 
of 
demarcation." 
(See 
announcement 
of 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
Iskra.)[38] 
In 
a 
word, 
the 
Germans 
stand 
for 
what 
is 
and 
reject 
changes; 
we 
demand 
changes, 
and 
reject 
subservience 
to, 
and 
conciliation 
with, 
what 
is. 


This 
"little" 
difference 
our 
"free" 
copyists 
of 
German 
resolutions 
failed 
to 
notice! 



D. 
ENGELS 
ON 
THE 
IMPORTANCE 
OF 
THE 
THEORETICAL 
STRUGGLE 
"Dogmatism, 
doctrinairism," 
"ossification 
of 
the 
Party 
--the 
inevitable 
retribution 
that 
follows 
the 
violent 
strait-lacing 
of 
thought" 
--these 
are 
the 
enemies 
against 
which 
the 
knightly 
champions 
of 
"freedom 
of 
criticism" 
in 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
rise 
up 
in 
arms. 
We 
are 
very 
glad 
that 
this 
question 
has 
been 
placed 
on 
the 
order 
of 
the 
day 
and 
we 
would 
only 
propose 
to 
add 
to 
it 
another 
question: 


Who 
are 
the 
judges? 


Before 
us 
lie 
two 
publisher's 
announcements. 
One, 
The 
Program 
of 
the 
Periodical 
Organ 
of 
the 
Union 
of 
Russian 
Social-Democrats 
-
the 
"Rabocheye 
Dyelo" 
(reprint 
from 
No. 
1 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo), 
and 
the 
other 
an 
announcement 
of 
the 
resumption 
of 
the 
publications 
of 
the 
Emancipation 
of 
Labour 
group.[39] 
Both 
are 
dated 
1899, 
a 
time 
when 
the 
"crisis 
of 
Marxism" 
had 
long 
since 
been 
under 
discussion. 
And 
what 
do 
we 
find? 
You 
would 
seek 
in 
vain 
in 
the 
first 
announcement 
for 
any 
reference 
to 
this 
phenomenon, 
or 
a 
definite 
statement 
of 
the 
position 
the 
new 
organ 
intends 
to 
adopt 
on 
this 
question. 
Of 
theoretical 
work 
and 
the 
urgent 
tasks 
that 
now 
confront 
it 
not 
a 
word 
is 
said, 
either 
in 
this 
program 
or 
in 
the 
supplements 
to 
it 
that 
were 
adopted 
by 
the 
Third 
Congress 
of 
the 
Union 
in 
1901 
(Two 
Congresses, 
pp. 
15-18). 
During 
the 
whole 
of 
this 
time 
the 
editorial 
board 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
ignored 
theoretical 
questions, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
these 
questions 
were 
agitating 
the 
minds 
of 
all 
Social-Democrats 
all 
over 
the 
world. 


The 
other 
announcement, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
points 
first 
of 
all 
to 
the 
decreased 
interest 
in 
theory 
observed 
in 
recent 
years, 
imperatively 
demands 
"vigilant 
attention 
to 
the 
theoretical 
aspect 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
movement 
of 
the 
proletariat," 
and 
calls 
for 
"ruthless 
criticism 
of 
the 
Bernsteinian 
and 
other 
antirevolutionary 
tendencies" 
in 
our 
movement. 
The 
issues 
of 
the 
Zarya 
that 
have 
appeared 
show 
how 
this 
program 
has 
been 
carried 
out. 


Thus 
we 
see 
that 
high-sounding 
phrases 
against 
the 
ossification 
of 
thought, 
etc., 
conceal 
unconcern 
for 
and 
impotence 
in 
the 
development 
of 
theoretical 
thought. 
The 
case 
of 
the 
Russian 
Social-Democrats 
very 
strikingly 
illustrates 
the 
phenomenon 
observed 
in 
the 
whole 
of 
Europe 
(and 
long 
ago 
noted 
also 
by 
the 
German 
Marxists) 
that 
the 
celebrated 
freedom! 
of 
criticism 
does 
not 
imply 
the 
substitution 
of 
one 
theory 
for 
a 
other, 
but 
freedom 
from 
all 



integral 
and 
considered 
theory; 
it 
implies 
eclecticism 
and 
lack 
of 
principle. 
Those 
who 
have 
the 
slightest 
acquaintance 
with 
the 
actual 
state 
of 
our 
movement 
cannot 
but 
see 
that 
the 
wide 
spread 
of 
Marxism 
was 
accompanied 
by 
a 
certain 
lowering 
of 
the 
theoretical 
level. 
Quite 
a 
number 
of 
people 
with 
very 
little, 
and 
even 
a 
total 
lack 
of 
theoretical 
training 
joined 
the 
movement 
because 
of 
its 
practical 
significance 
and 
its 
practical 
successes. 
We 
can 
judge 
from 
that 
how 
tactless 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
is 
when, 
with 
an 
air 
of 
triumph, 
it 
quotes 
Marx's 
statement: 
"Every 
step 
of 
real 
movement 
is 
more 
important 
than 
a 
dozen 
programs."[40] 
To 
repeat 
these 
words 
in 
a 
period 
of 
theoretical 
chaos 
is 
like 
wishing 
mourners 
at 
a 
funeral 
"many 
happy 
returns 
of 
the 
day." 
Moreover, 
these 
words 
of 
Marx 
are 
taken 
from 
his 
letter 
on 
the 
Gotha 
Program, 
in 
which 
he 
sharply 
condemns 
eclecticism 
in 
the 
formulation 
of 
principles: 
If 
you 
must 
unite, 
Marx 
wrote 
to 
the 
party 
leaders, 
then 
enter 
into 
agreements 
to 
satisfy 
the 
practical 
aims 
of 
the 
movement, 
but 
do 
not 
allow 
any 
bargaining 
over 
principle, 
do 
not 
make 
"concessions" 
in 
questions 
of 
theory. 
This 
was 
Marx's 
idea, 
and 
yet 
there 
are 
people 
among 
us 
who 
strive 
-in 
his 
name 
--to 
belittle 
the 
significance 
of 
theory! 


Without 
a 
reolutionary 
theory 
there 
can 
be 
no 
revolutionary 
movement. 
This 
thought 
cannot 
be 
insisted 
upon 
too 
strongly 
at 
a 
time 
when 
the 
fashionable 
preaching 
of 
opportunism 
goes 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
an 
infatuation 
for 
the 
narrowest 
forms 
of 
practical 
activity. 
Yet, 
for 
Russian 
Social-
Democrats 
the 
importance 
of 
theory 
is 
enhanced 
by 
three 
more 
circumstances, 
which 
are 
often 
forgotten: 
firstly, 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
our 
Party 
is 
only 
in 
process 
of 
formation, 
its 
features 
are 
only 
just 
becoming 
outlined, 
and 
it 
is 
yet 
far 
from 
having 
settled 
accounts 
with 
other 
trends 
of 
revolutionary 
thought, 
which 
threaten 
to 
divert 
the 
movement 
from 
the 
correct 
path. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
precisely 
the 
very 
recent 
past 
was 
marked 
by 
a 
revival 
of 
nonSocial-
Democratic 
revolutionary 
trends 
(which 
Axelrod 
long 
ago 
warned 
the 
Economists 
would 
happen). 
Under 
these 
circumstances, 
what 
at 
first 
sight 
appears 
to 
be 
an 
"unimportant" 
mistake 
may 
lead 
to 
most 
deplorable 
consequences, 
and 
only 
shortsighted 
people 
can 
consider 
factional 
disputes 
and 
a 
strict 
differentiation 
between 
shades 
inopportune 
or 
superfluous. 
The 
fate 
of 
Russian 
Social-Democracy 
for 
many, 
many 
years 
to 
come 
may 
depend 
on 
the 
strengthening 
of 
one 
or 
other 
"shade." 


Secondly, 
the 
Social-Democratic 
movement 
is 
in 
its 
very 
essence 
an 
international 
movement. 
This 
means 
not 
only 
that 
we 
must 
combat 
national 
chauvinism, 
but 
also 
that 
a 
movement 
that 
is 
starting 
in 
a 
young 
country 
can 



be 
successful 
only 
if 
it 
implements 
the 
experience 
of 
other 
countries. 
And 
in 
order 
to 
implement 
this 
experience, 
it 
is 
not 
enough 
merely 
to 
be 
acquainted 
with 
it, 
or 
simply 
to 
transcribe 
the 
latest 
resolutions. 
What 
it 
requires 
is 
the 
ability 
to 
treat 
this 
experience 
critically 
and 
to 
test 
it 
independently. 
Anybody 
who 
realizes 
how 
enormously 
the 
modern 
working-class 
movement 
has 
grown 
and 
branched 
out 
will 
understand 
what 
a 
reserve 
of 
theoretical 
forces 
and 
political 
(as 
well 
as 
revolutionary) 
experience 
is 
required 
to 
fulfil 
this 
task. 


Thirdly, 
the 
national 
tasks 
of 
Russian 
Social-Democracy 
are 
such 
as 
have 
never 
confronted 
any 
other 
socialist 
party 
in 
the 
world. 
Further 
on 
we 
shall 
have 
occasion 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
political 
and 
organizational 
duties 
which 
the 
task 
of 
emancipating 
the 
whole 
people 
from 
the 
yoke 
of 
autocracy 
imposes 
upon 
us. 
At 
this 
point, 
we 
only 
wish 
to 
state 
that 
the 
role 
of 
vanguard 
fighter 
can 
be 
fulfilled 
only 
by 
a 
party 
that 
is 
guided 
by 
the 
most 
advanced 
theory. 
In 
order 
to 
get 
some 
concrete 
understanding 
of 
what 
this 
means, 
let 
the 
reader 
recall 
such 
predecessors 
of 
Russian 
Social-Democracy 
as 
Herzen, 
Belinsky, 
Chernyshevsky 
and 
the 
brilliant 
galaxy 
of 
revolutionaries 
of 
the 
'seventies; 
let 
him 
ponder 
over 
the 
world 
significance 
which 
Russian 
literature 
is 
now 
acquiring; 
let 
him 
. 
. 
. 
but 
that 
is 
enough! 


Let 
us 
quote 
what 
Engels 
said 
in 
1874 
concerning 
the 
significance 
of 
theory 
in 
the 
Social-Democratic 
movement. 
Engels 
recognizes 
not 
two 
forms 
of 
the 
great 
struggle 
of 
Social-

Democracy 
(political 
and 
economic), 
as 
is 
the 
fashion 
among 
us, 
but 
three, 
placing 
on 
a 
par 
with 
the 
first 
two 
the 
theoretical 
struggle. 
His 
recommendations 
to 
the 
German 
working 
class 
movement, 
which 
had 
become 
strong, 
practically 
and 
politically, 
are 
so 
instructive 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
present 
day 
problems 
and 
controversies, 
that 
we 
hope 
the 
reader 
will 
not 
be 
vexed 
with 
us 
for 
quoting 
a 
long 
passage 
from 
his 
prefatory 
note 
to 
Der 
deutsche 
Bauernkrieg,[41] 
which 
has 
long 
become 
a 
great 
bibliographical 
rarity. 


"The 
German 
workers 
have 
two 
important 
advantages 
over 
those 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
Europe. 
First, 
they 
belong 
to 
the 
most 
theoretical 
people 
of 
Europe; 
and 
they 
have 
retained 
that 
sense 
of 
theory 
which 
the 
so-called 
'educated' 
classes 
of 
Germany 
have 
almost 
completely 
lost. 
Without 
German 
philosophy 
which 
preceded 
it, 
particularly 
that 
of 
Hegel, 
German 
scientific 
Socialism 
--the 
only 
scientific 
Socialism 
that 
has 
ever 
existed 
--would 
never 
have 
come 
into 
being. 
Without 
a 
sense 
of 
theory 
among 
the 
workers, 
this 



scientific 
Socialism 
would 
never 
have 
entered 
their 
flesh 
and 
blood 
as 
much 
as 
is 
the 
case. 
What 
an 
immeasurable 
advantage 
this 
is 
may 
be 
seen, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
from 
the 
indifference 
towards 
all 
theory, 
which 
is 
one 
of 
the 
main 
reasons 
why 
the 
English 
working-class 
movement 
crawls 
along 
so 
slowly 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
splendid 
organization 
of 
the 
individual 
unions; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
from 
the 
mischief 
and 
confusion 
wrought 
by 
Proudhonism, 
in 
its 
original 
form, 
among 
the 
French 
and 
Belgians, 
and, 
in 
the 
form 
further 
caricatured 
by 
Bakunin, 
among 
the 
Spaniards 
and 
Italians. 


"The 
second 
advantage 
is 
that, 
chronologically 
speaking, 
the 
Germans 
were 
about 
the 
last 
to 
come 
into 
the 
workers' 
movement. 
Just 
as 
German 
theoretical 
Socialism 
will 
never 
forget 
that 
it 
rests 
on 
the 
shoulders 
of 
Saint-
Simon, 
Fourier 
and 
Owen 
--three 
men 
who, 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
their 
fantastic 
notions 
and 
all 
their 
utopianism, 
have 
their 
place 
among 
the 
most 
eminent 
thinkers 
of 
all 
times, 
and 
whose 
genius 
anticipated 
innumerable 
things 
the 
correctness 
of 
which 
is 
now 
being 
scientifically 
proved 
by 
us 
--so 
the 
practical 
workers' 
movement 
in 
Germany 
ought 
never 
to 
forget 
that 
it 
has 
developed 
on 
the 
shoulders 
of 
the 
English 
and 
French 
movements, 
that 
it 
was 
able 
simply 
to 
utilize 
their 
dearly-bought 
experience, 
and 
could 
now 
avoid 
their 
mistakes, 
which 
in 
their 
time 
were 
mostly 
unavoidable. 
Without 
the 
precedent 
of 
the 
English 
trade 
unions 
and 
French 
workers' 
political 
struggles, 
without 
the 
gigantic 
impulse 
given 
especially 
by 
the 
Paris 
Commune, 
where 
would 
we 
be 
now? 


"It 
must 
be 
said 
to 
the 
credit 
of 
the 
German 
workers 
that 
they 
have 
used 
the 
advantages 
of 
their 
situation 
with 
rare 
understanding. 
For 
the 
first 
time 
since 
the 
working-class 
movement 
has 
existed, 
the 
struggle 
is 
being 
waged 
in 
a 
planned 
way 
from 
its 
three 
coordinated 
and 
interconnected 
sides, 
the 
theoretical, 
the 
political 
and 
the 
practical-economic 
(resistance 
to 
the 
capitalists). 
It 
is 
precisely 
in 
this, 
as 
it 
were, 
concentric 
attack, 
that 
the 
strength 
and 
invincibility 
of 
the 
German 
movement 
lies. 


"Due 
to 
this 
advantageous 
situation, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
to 
the 
insular 
peculiarities 
of 
the 
English 
and 
the 
forcible 
suppression 
of 
the 
French 
movement, 
on 
the 
other, 
the 
German 
workers 
have 
for 
the 
moment 
been 
placed 
in 
the 
vanguard 
of 
the 
proletarian 
struggle. 
How 
long 
events 
will 
allow 
them 
to 
occupy 
this 
post 
of 
honour 
cannot 
be 
foretold. 
But 
let 
us 
hope 
that 
as 
long 
as 
they 
occupy 
it, 
they 
will 
fill 
it 
fittingly. 
This 
demands 
redoubled 
efforts 
in 
every 
field 
of 
struggle 
and 
agitation. 
In 
particular, 
it 
will 
be 
the 
duty 
of 
the 
leaders 
to 
gain 
an 
ever 
clearer 
insight 
into 
all 
the-oretical 



questions, 
to 
free 
themselves 
more 
and 
more 
from 
the 
influence 
of 
traditional 
phrases 
inherited 
from 
the 
old 
world 
outlook, 
and 
constantly 
to 
keep 
in 
mind 
that 
Socialism, 
since 
it 
has 
become 
a 
science, 
demands 
that 
it 
be 
pursued 
as 
a 
science, 
i.e., 
that 
it 
be 
studied. 
The 
task 
will 
be 
to 
spread 
with 
increased 
zeal 
among 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers 
the 
ever 
more 
clarified 
understanding 
thus 
acquired, 
to 
knit 
together 
ever 
more 
firmly 
the 
organization 
both 
of 
the 
party 
and 
of 
the 
trade 
unions. 


" 
. 
. 
. 
If 
the 
German 
workers 
proceed 
in 
this 
way, 
they 
will 
not 
be 
marching 
exactly 
at 
the 
head 
of 
the 
movement 
--it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
this 
movement 
that 
the 
workers 
of 
any 
particular 
country 
should 
march 
at 
its 
head 
--but 
will, 
nevertheless, 
occupy 
an 
honourable 
place 
in 
the 
battle 
line; 
and 
they 
will 
stand 
armed 
for 
battle 
when 
either 
unexpectedly 
grave 
trials 
or 
momentous 
events 
demand 
of 
them 
increased 
courage, 
increased 
determination 
and 
energy.[42] 


Engels' 
words 
proved 
prophetic. 
Within 
a 
few 
years 
the 
German 
workers 
were 
subjected 
to 
unexpectedly 
grave 
trials 
in 
the 
shape 
of 
the 
Anti-
Socialist 
Law. 
And 
the 
German 
workers 
really 
met 
them 
armed 
for 
battle 
and 
succeeded 
in 
emerging 
from 
them 
victoriously. 


The 
Russian 
proletariat 
will 
have 
to 
undergo 
trials 
immeasurably 
more 
grave; 
it 
will 
have 
to 
fight 
a 
monster 
compared 
with 
which 
the 
Anti-Socialist 
Law 
in 
a 
constitutional 
country 
seems 
but 
a 
pigmy. 
History 
has 
now 
confronted 
us 
with 
an 
immediate 
task 
which 
is 
the 
most 
revolutionary 
of 
all 
the 
immediate 
tasks 
that 
confront 
the 
proletariat 
of 
any 
country. 
The 
fulfilment 
of 
this 
task, 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
most 
powerful 
bulwark, 
not 
only 
of 
European, 
but 
also 
(it 
may 
now 
be 
said) 
of 
Asiatic 
reaction, 
would 
make 
the 
Russian 
proletariat 
the 
vanguard 
of 
the 
international 
revolutionary 
proletariat. 
And 
we 
have 
the 
right 
to 
count 
upon 
acquiring 
this 
honourable 
title 
already 
earned 
by 
our 
predecessors, 
the 
revolutionaries 
of 
the 
'seventies, 
if 
we 
succeed 
in 
inspiring 
our 
movement 
--which 
is 
a 
thousand 
times 
broader 
and 
deeper 
--with 
the 
same 
devoted 
determination 
and 
vigour. 



II. 
The 
Spontaneity 
Of 
The 
Masses 
And 
The 
Consciousness 
Of 
The 
Social-Democrats 

We 
have 
said 
that 
our 
movement, 
much 
wider 
and 
deeper 
than 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
'seventies, 
must 
be 
inspired 
with 
the 
same 
devoted 
determination 
and 
vigour 
that 
inspired 
the 
movement 
at 
that 
time. 
Indeed, 
no 
one, 
we 
think, 
has 
up 
to 
now 
doubted 
that 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
present-day 
movement 
lies 
in 
the 
awakening 
of 
the 
masses 
(principally, 
the 
industrial 
proletariat), 
and 
that 
its 
weakness 
lies 
in 
the 
lack 
of 
consciousness 
and 
initiative 
among 
the 
revolutionary 
leaders. 


However, 
of 
late 
a 
most 
astonishing 
discovery 
has 
been 
made, 
which 
threatens 
to 
overthrow 
all 
the 
views 
that 
had 
hitherto 
prevailed 
on 
this 
question. 
This 
discovery 
was 
made 
by 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
which 
in 
its 
controversy 
with 
the 
Iskra 
and 
the 
Zarya 
did 
not 
confine 
itself 
to 
making 
objections 
on 
separate 
points, 
but 
tried 
to 
ascribe 
"general 
disagreements" 
to 
a 
more 
profound 
cause 
--to 
the 
"different 
appraisals 
of 
the 
relative 
importance 
of 
the 
spontaneous 
and 
consciously 
'methodical' 
element." 
The 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
formulated 
its 
indictment 
as 
a 
belittling 
of 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
objective 
or 
the 
spontaneous 
element 
of 
development." 
[*] 
To 
this 
we 
say: 
if 
the 
controversy 
with 
the 
Iskra 
and 
the 
Zarya 
resulted 
in 
nothing 
more 
than 
causing 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
to 
hit 
upon 
these 
"general 
disagreements," 
that 
result 
alone 
would 
give 
us 
considerble 
satisfaction, 
so 
significant 
is 
this 
thesis 
and 
so 
clearly 
does 
it 
illuminate 
the 
quintessence 
of 
the 
present-day 
theoretical 
and 
political 
differences 
that 
exist 
among 
Russian 
Social-Democrats. 


That 
is 
why 
the 
question 
of 
the 
relation 
between 
consciousness 
and 
spontaneity 
is 
of 
such 
enormous 
general 
interest, 
and 
that 
is 
why 
this 
question 
must 
be 
dealt 
with 
in 
great 
detail. 



A. 
THE 
BEGINNING 
OF 
THE 
SPONTANEOUS 
UPSURGE 
In 
the 
previous 
chapter 
we 
pointed 
out 
how 
universally 
absorbed 
the 
educated 
youth 
of 
Russia 
was 
in 
the 
theories 
of 
Marxism 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
'nineties. 
The 
strikes 
that 
followed 
the 
famous 
St. 
Petersburg 
industrial 
war 
of 
1896 
assumed 
a 
similar 
wholesale 
character. 
The 
fact 
that 
these 
strikes 
spread 
over 
the 
whole 
of 
Russia 
clearly 
showed 
how 
deep 
the 
newly 
awakening 
popular 
movement 
was, 
and 
if 
we 
are 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
"spontaneous 
element" 
then, 
of 
course, 
it 
is 
this 
movement 
which, 
first 
and 
foremost, 
must 
be 
regarded 
as 
spontaneous. 
But 
there 
is 
spontaneity 
and 
spontaneity. 
Strikes 
occurred 
in 
Russia 
in 
the 
'seventies 
and

'sixties 
(and 
even 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century), 
and 
were 
accompanied 
by 
the 
"spontaneous" 
destruction 
of 
machinery, 
etc. 
Compared 
with 
these 
"riots" 
the 
strikes 
of 
the 
'nineties 
might 
even 
be 
described 
as 
"conscious," 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
do 
they 
mark 
the 
progress 
which 
the 
working-
class 
movement 
had 
made 
in 
that 
period. 
This 
shows 
that 
the 
"spontaneous 
element," 
in 
essence, 
represents 
nothing 
more 
nor 
less 
than 
consciousness 
in 
an 
embryonic 
form. 
Even 
the 
primitive 
riots 
expressed 
the 
awakening 
of 
consciousness 
to 
a 
certain 
extent: 
the 
workers 
were 
losing 
their 
agelong 
faith 
in 
the 
permanence 
of 
the 
system 
which 
oppressed 
them. 
They 
began 
. 
. 
. 
I 
shall 
not 
say 
to 
understand, 
but 
to 
sense 
the 
necessity 
for 
collective 
resistance, 
and 
definitely 
abandoned 
their 
slavish 
submission 
to 
their 
superiors. 
But 
this 
was, 
nevertheless, 
more 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
outbursts 
of 
desperation 
and 
vengeance 
than 
of 
struggle. 
The 
strikes 
of 
the 
'nineties 
revealed 
far 
greater 
flashes 
of 
consciousness: 
definite 
demands 
were 
advanced, 
the 
strike 
was 
carefully 
timed, 
known 
cases 
and 
examples 
in 
other 
places 
were 
discussed, 
etc. 
While 
the 
riots 
were 
simply 
revolts 
of 
the 
oppressed, 
the 
systematic 
strikes 
represented 
the 
class 
struggle 
in 
embryo, 
but 
only 
in 
embryo. 
Taken 
by 
themselves, 
these 
strikes 
were 
simply 
trade 
union 
struggles, 
but 
not 
yet 
Social-Democratic 
struggles. 
They 
testified 
to 
the 
awakening 
antagonisms 
between 
workers 
and 
employers, 
but 
the 
workers 
were 
not, 
and 
could 
not 
be, 
conscious 
of 
the 
irreconcilable 
antagonism 
of 
their 
interests 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
modern 
political 
and 
social 
system, 
i.e., 
theirs 
was 
not 
yet 
Social-Democratic 
consciousness. 
In 
this 
sense, 
the 
strikes 
of 
the 
'nineties, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
enormous 
progress 
they 
represented 
as 



compared 
with 
the 
"riots," 
remained 
a 
purely 
spontaneous 
movement. 


We 
have 
said 
that 
there 
could 
not 
yet 
be 
Social-Democratic 
consciousness 
among 
the 
workers. 
It 
could 
only 
be 
brought 
to 
them 
from 
without. 
The 
history 
of 
all 
countries 
shows 
that 
the 
working 
class 
exclusively 
by 
its 
own 
effort, 
is 
able 
to 
develop 
only 
trade 
union 
consciousness, 
i.e., 
the 
conviction 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
combine 
in 
unions, 
fight 
the 
employers 
and 
strive 
to 
compel 
the 
government 
to 
pass 
necessary 
labour 
legislation, 
etc. 
[*] 
The 
theory 
of 
Socialism, 
however, 
grew 
out 
of 
the 
philosophic, 
historical 
and 
economic 
theories 
that 
were 
elaborated 
by 
the 
educated 
representatives 
of 
the 
propertied 
classes, 
the 
intellectuals. 
According 
to 
their 
social 
status, 
the 
founders 
of 
modern 
scientific 
Socialism, 
Marx 
and 
Engels, 
themselves 
belonged 
to 
the 
bourgeois 
intelligentsia. 
In 
the 
very 
same 
way, 
in 
Russia, 
the 
theoretical 
doctrine 
of 
Social-Democracy 
arose 
quite 
independently 
of 
the 
spontaneous 
growth 
of 
the 
working-class 
movement, 
it 
arose 
as 
a 
natural 
and 
inevitable 
outcome 
of 
the 
development 
of 
ideas 
among 
the 
revolutionary 
socialist 
intelligentsia. 
At 
the 
time 
of 
which 
we 
are 
speaking, 
i.e., 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
'nineties, 
this 
doctrine 
not 
only 
represented 
the 
completely 
formulated 
program 
of 
the 
Emancipation 
of 
Labour 
group, 
but 
had 
already 
won 
over 
to 
its 
side 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
youth 
in 
Russia. 


Hence, 
we 
had 
both 
the 
spontaneous 
awakening 
of 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers, 
the 
awakening 
to 
conscious 
life 
and 
conscious 
struggle, 
and 
a 
revolutionary 
youth, 
armed 
with 
the 
Social-Democratic 
theory, 
eager 
to 
come 
into 
contact 
with 


* 
Trade 
unionism 
does 
not 
exclude 
"politics" 
altogether, 
as 
some 
imagine. 
Trade 
unions 
have 
always 
conducted 
some 
political 
(but 
not 
Social-
Democratic) 
agitation 
and 
struggle. 
We 
shall 
deal 
with 
the 
difference 
between 
trade 
union 
politics 
and 
Social-Democratic 
politics 
in 
the 
next 
chapter. 
the 
workers. 
In 
this 
connection 
it 
is 
particularly 
important 
to 
state 
the 
oft-
forgotten 
(and 
comparatively 
little-known) 
fact 
that 
the 
early 
Social-
Democrats 
of 
that 
period 
zealously 
carried 
on 
economic 
agitation 
(being 
guided 
in 
this 
by 
the 
really 
useful 
instructions 
contained 
in 
the 
pamphlet 
On 
Agitation 
that 
was 
still 
in 
manuscript), 
but 
they 
did 
not 
regard 
this 
as 
their 
sole 
task. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
right 
from 
the 
very 
beginning 
they 
advanced 
the 
widest 
historical 
tasks 
of 
Russian 
Social-Democracy 
in 
general, 
and 
the 
task 
of 
overthrowing 
the 
autocracy 
in 
particular. 
For 
example, 
already 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
1895, 
the 
St. 
Petersburg 
group 
of 
Social-Democrats, 
which 
founded 



the 
League 
of 
Struggle 
for 
the 
Emancipation 
of 
the 
Working 
Class, 


[43] 
prepared 
the 
first 
issue 
of 
a 
newspaper 
called 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo. 
This 
issue 
was 
ready 
to 
go 
to 
press 
when 
it 
was 
seized 
by 
the 
gendarmes 
who, 
on 
the 
night 
of 
December 
8, 
1895, 
raided 
the 
house 
of 
one 
of 
the 
members 
of 
the 
group, 
Anatoli 
Alexeyevich 
Vaneyev,[*] 
and 
so 
the 
original 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
was 
not 
destined 
to 
see 
the 
light 
of 
day. 
The 
leading 
article 
in 
this 
issue 
(which 
perhaps 
in 
some 
thirty 
years' 
time 
some 
Russkaya 
Starina"[44] 
will 
unearth 
in 
the 
archives 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Police) 
described 
the 
historical 
tasks 
of 
the 
working 
class 
in 
Russia, 
of 
which 
the 
achievement 
of 
political 
liberty 
is 
regarded 
as 
the 
most 
important. 
This 
issue 
also 
contained 
an 
article 
entitled 
"What 
Are 
Our 
Cabinet 
Ministers 
Thinking 
Of?"[45] 
which 
dealt 
with 
the 
breaking 
up 
of 
the 
elementary 
education 
* 
A. 
A. 
Vaneyev 
died 
in 
Eastern 
Siberia 
in 
1899 
from 
consumption, 
which 
he 
contracted 
during 
solitary 
confinement 
in 
prison 
prior 
to 
his 
banishment. 
That 
is 
why 
we 
considered 
it 
possible 
to 
publish 
the 
above 
information, 
the 
authenticity 
of 
which 
we 
guarantee, 
for 
it 
comes 
from 
persons 
who 
were 
closely 
and 
directly 
acquainted 
with 
A. 
A. 
Vaneyev. 
committees 
by 
the 
police. 
In 
addition, 
there 
was 
some 
correspondence, 
not 
only 
from 
St. 
Petersburg, 
but 
from 
other 
parts 
of 
Russia 
too 
(for 
example, 
a 
letter 
about 
the 
assault 
on 
the 
workers 
in 
Yaroslavl 
Gubernia). 
This, 
if 
we 
are 
not 
mistaken, 
"first 
effort" 
of 
the 
Russian 
Social-Democrats 
of 
the 
'nineties 
was 
not 
a 
narrow, 
local, 
and 
certainly 
not 
an 
"economic" 
newspaper, 
but 
one 
that 
aimed 
to 
unite 
the 
strike 
movement 
with 
the 
revolutionary 
movement 
against 
the 
autocracy, 
and 
to 
win 
all 
who 
were 
oppressed 
by 
the 
policy 
of 
reactionary 
obscurantism 
over 
to 
the 
side 
of 
Social-Democracy. 
No 
one 
in 
the 
slightest 
degree 
acquainted 
with 
the 
state 
of 
the 
movement 
at 
that 
period 
could 
doubt 
that 
such 
a 
paper 
would 
have 
met 
with 
warm 
response 
among 
the 
workers 
of 
the 
capital 
and 
the 
revolutionary 
intelligentsia 
and 
would 
have 
had 
a 
wide 
circulation. 
The 
failure 
of 
the 
enterprise 
merely 
showed 
that 
the 
Social-Democrats 
of 
that 
period 
were 
unable 
to 
meet 
the 
immediate 
requirements 
of 
the 
time 
owing 
to 
their 
lack 
of 
revolutionary 
experience 
and 
practical 
training. 
The 
same 
thing 
must 
be 
said 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
S. 
Peterburgsky 
Rabochy 
Listok 
[46] 
and 
particularly 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
Rabochaya 
Gazeta 
and 
the 
Manifesto 
of 
the 
Russian 
Social-Democratic 
Labour 
Party 
which 
was 
founded 
in 
the 
spring 
of 
1898. 
Of 
course, 
we 
would 
not 
dream 
of 
blaming 
the 
Social-Democrats 
of 
that 
time 
for 
this 
unpreparedness. 
But 
in 
order 
to 
profit 
from 
the 
experience 
of 
that 
movement, 



and 
to 
draw 
practical 
lessons 
from 
it, 
we 
must 
thoroughly 
understand 
the 
causes 
and 
significance 
of 
this 
or 
that 
shortcoming. 
For 
that 
reason 
it 
is 
extremely 
important 
to 
establish 
the 
fact 
that 
part 
(perhaps 
even 
a 
majority) 
of 
the 
Social-Democrats, 
operating 
in 
the 
period 
of 
1895-98, 
quite 
justly 
considered 
it 
possible 
even 
then, 
at 
the 
very 
beginning 
of 
the 
"spontaneous" 
movement, 
to 


come 
forward 
with 
a 
most 
extensive 
program 
and 
militant 
tactics.[*] 
The 
lack 
of 
training 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
revolutionaries, 
being 
quite 
a 
natural 
phenomenon, 
could 
not 
have 
aroused 
any 
particular 
fears. 
Since 
the 
tasks 
were 
correctly 
defined, 
since 
the 
energy 
existed 
for 
repeated 
attempts 
to 
fulfil 
these 
tasks, 
temporary 
failures 
were 
not 
such 
a 
great 
misfortune. 
Revolutionary 
experience 
and 
organizational 
skill 
are 
things 
that 
can 
be 
acquired 
provided 
the 
desire 
is 
there 
to 
acquire 
them, 
provided 
the 
shortcomings 
are 
recognized 
--which 
in 
revolutionary 
activity 
is 
more 
than 
halfway 
towards 
removing 
them! 


But 
what 
was 
not 
a 
great 
misfortune 
became 
a 
real 
misfortune 
when 
this 
consciousness 
began 
to 
grow 
dim 
(it 
was 
very 
much 
alive 
among 
the 
workers 
of 
the 
group 
mentioned), 
when 
people 
--and 
even 
Social-
Democratic 
organs 
--appeared 
who 
were 
prepared 
to 
regard 
shortcomings 
as 
virtues, 
who 
even 
tried 
to 
invent 
a 
theoretical 
basis 
for 
slavish 
cringing 
before 
spontaneity. 
It 
is 
time 
to 
summarize 
this 
trend, 


* 
"In 
adopting 
a 
hostile 
attitude 
towards 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
Social-
Democrats 
of 
the 
end 
of 
the 
'nineties, 
the 
Iskra 
ignores 
the 
fact 
that 
at 
that 
time 
the 
conditions 
for 
any 
other 
kind 
of 
work 
except 
the 
struggle 
for 
petty 
demands 
were 
absent," 
declare 
the 
Economists 
in 
their 
Letter 
to 
Russian 
Social-Democratic 
Organs.(Iskra, 
No. 
12.) 
The 
facts 
quoted 
above 
show 
that 
the 
assertion 
about 
"absent 
conditions" 
is 
the 
very 
opposite 
of 
the 
truth. 
Not 
only 
at 
the 
end, 
but 
even 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
'nineties, 
all 
the 
conditions 
existed 
for 
other 
work, 
besides 
fighting 
for 
petty 
demands, 
all 
the 
conditions 
-
except 
sufficient 
training 
of 
the 
leaders. 
Instead 
of 
frankly 
admitting 
our, 
the 
ideologists', 
the 
leaders', 
lack 
of 
sufficient 
training 
--the 
"Economists" 
want 
to 
shift 
the 
blame 
entirely 
upon 
the 
"absent 
conditions," 
upon 
the 
influences 
of 
material 
environment 
that 
determine 
the 
road 
from 
which 
it 
will 
be 
impossible 
for 
any 
ideologist 
to 
divert 
the 
movemcnt. 
What 
is 
this 
but 
slavish 
cringing 
before 
spontaneity, 
but 
the 
infatuation 
of 
the 
"ideologists" 
with 
their 
own 
short 
comings? 
the 
substance 
of 
which 
is 
incorrectly 
and 
too 
narrowly 
described 
as 



"Economism." 



B. 
BOWING 
TO 
SPONTANEITY. 
THE 
RABOCHAYA 
MYSL 
Before 
dealing 
with 
the 
literary 
manifestation 
of 
this 
subservience, 
we 
should 
like 
to 
note 
the 
following 
characteristic 
fact 
(communicated 
to 
us 
from 
the 
above-mentioned 
source), 
which 
throws 
some 
light 
on 
the 
circumstances 
in 
which 
the 
two 
future 
conflicting 
trends 
in 
Russian 
Social-Democracy 
arose 
and 
grew 
among 
the 
comrades 
working 
in 
St. 
Petersburg. 
In 
the 
beginning 
of 
1897, 
just 
prior 
to 
their 
banishment, 
A. 
A. 
Vaneyev 
and 
several 
of 
his 
comrades 
attended 
a 
private 
meeting[47] 
at 
which 
"old" 
and 
"young" 
members 
of 
the 
League 
of 
Struggle 
for 
the 
Emancipation 
of 
the 
Working 
Class 
gathered. 
The 
conversation 
centred 
chiefly 
around 
the 
question 
of 
organization, 
and 
particularly 
around 
the 
"rules 
for 
the 
workers' 
benefit 
fund," 
which, 
in 
their 
final 
form, 
were 
published 
in 
the 
Listok 
Rabotnika,[48] 
No. 
910, 
p. 
46. 
Sharp 
differences 
were 
immediately 
revealed 
between 
the 
"old" 
members 
("Decembrists," 
as 
the 
St. 
Petersburg 
Social-Democrats 
jestingly 
called 
them) 
and 
several 
of 
the 
"young" 
members 
(who 
subsequently 
actively 
collaborated 
on 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
), 
and 
a 
very 
heated 
discussion 
ensued. 
The 
"young" 
members 
defended 
the 
main 
principles 
of 
the 
rules 
in 
the 
form 
in 
which 
they 
were 
published. 
The 
"old" 
members 
said 
that 
the 
prime 
necessity 
was 
not 
this, 
but 
the 
consolidation 
of 
the 
League 
of 
Struggle 
into 
an 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries 
to 
which 
all 
the 
various 
workers' 
benefit 
funds, 
students' 
propaganda 
circles, 
etc., 
should 
be 
subordinated. 
It 


goes 
without 
saying 
that 
the 
controversialists 
had 
no 
suspicion 
at 
that 
time 
that 
these 
disagreements 
were 
the 
beginning 
of 
a 
divergence; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
they 
regarded 
them 
as 
being 
of 
an 
isolated 
and 
casual 
nature. 
But 
this 
fact 
shows 
that 
in 
Russia 
too 
"Economism" 
did 
not 
arise 
and 
spread 
without 
a 
fight 
against 
the 
"old" 
Social-Democrats 
(the 
Economists 
of 
today 
are 
apt 
to 
forget 
this). 
And 
if, 
in 
the 
main, 
this 
struggle 
has 
not 
left 
"documentary" 
traces 
behind 
it, 
it 
is 
solely 
because 
the 
membership 
of 
the 
circles 
functioning 
at 
that 
time 
underwent 
such 
constant 
change 
that 
no 
continuity 
was 
established 
and, 
consequently, 
differences 
were 
not 
recorded 
in 
any 
documents. 


The 
appearance 
of 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
brought 
Economisn 
to 
the 
light 
of 
day, 
but 
not 
all 
at 
once. 
We 
must 
picture 
to 
ourselves 
concretely 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
work 
and 
the 
short-lived 
character 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
Russian 
circles 
(and 
only 
those 
who 
have 
experienced 
this 
can 
have 
any 
exact 



idea 
of 
it), 
in 
order 
to 
understand 
how 
much 
there 
was 
accidental 
in 
the 
successes 
and 
failures 
of 
the 
new 
trend 
in 
various 
towns, 
and 
for 
how 
long 
a 
time 
neither 
the 
advocates 
nor 
the 
opponents 
of 
this 
"new" 
trend 
could 
make 
up 
their 
minds 
--indeed 
they 
had 
no 
opportunity 
to 
do 
so 
--as 
to 
whether 
this 
was 
really 
a 
distinct 
trend 
or 
whether 
it 
was 
merely 
an 
expression 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
training 
of 
certain 
individuals. 
For 
example, 
the 
first 
mimeographed 
copies 
of 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
never 
reached 
the 
great 
majority 
of 
Social-Democrats, 
and 
we 
are 
able 
to 
refer 
to 
the 
leading 
article 
in 
the 
first 
number 
only 
because 
it 
was 
reproduced 
in 
an 
article 
by 
V. 
I.[49] 
(Listok 
Rabotnika, 
No. 
9-10, 
p. 
47 
et 
seq.), 
who, 
of 
course, 
did 
not 
fail 
to 
extol 
with 
more 
zeal 
than 
reason 
the 
new 
paper, 
which 
was 
so 
different 
from 
the 
papers 
and 
the 


plans 
for 
papers 
mentioned 
above.[*] 
And 
this 
leading 
article 
deserves 
to 
be 
dealt 
with 
because 
it 
so 
strongly 
expresses 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
and 
Economism 
generally. 


After 
stating 
that 
the 
arm 
of 
the 
"blue-coats"[50] 
could 
never 
stop 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
working-class 
movement, 
the 
leading 
article 
goes 
on 
to 
say: 
". 
. 
. 
The 
virility 
of 
the 
working-class 
movement 
is 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
workers 
themselves 
are 
at 
last 
taking 
their 
fate 
into 
their 
own 
hands, 
and 
out 
of 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
leaders," 
and 
this 
fundamental 
thesis 
is 
then 
developed 
in 
greater 
detail. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
the 
leaders 
(i.e., 
the 
Social-Democrats, 
the 
organizers 
of 
the 
League 
of 
Struggle) 
were, 
one 
might 
say, 
torn 
out 
of 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
workers[**] 
by 
the 
police; 
yet 
it 
is 
made 
to 
appear 
that 
the 
workers 
were 
fighting 
against 
the 
leaders, 
and 
liberated 
themselves 
from 
their 
yoke! 
Instead 
of 
sounding 
the 
call 
to 
go 
forward, 
towards 
the 
consolidation 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
organization 
and 
to 
the 
expansion 
of 
political 
activity, 
the 
call 
for 
a 
retreat 
to 
the 
purely 
trade 
union 
struggle 
was 
issued. 
It 
was 
announced 
that 
"the 
economic 
basis 
of 
the 
movement 
is 
eclipsed 
by 
the 
effort 
never 
to 
forget 
the 
political 
ideal," 
and 
that 
the 
watchword 
for 
the 
working-
class 
movement 
was 
"Fight 
for 
economic 
conditions" 
(!) 
or, 
still 
better, 
"The 


* 
It 
should 
be 
stated 
in 
passing 
that 
the 
praise 
of 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
in 
November 
1898, 
when 
Economism 
had 
become 
fully 
defined, 
especially 
abroad, 
emanated 
from 
that 
same 
V. 
I., 
who 
very 
soon 
after 
became 
one 
of 
the 
editors 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo. 
And 
yet 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
denied 
that 
there 
were 
two 
trends 
in 
Russian 
Social-Democracy, 
and 
continues 
to 
deny 
it 
to 
this 
day! 
** 
That 
this 
simile 
is 
a 
correct 
one 
is 
shown 
by 
the 
following 
characteristic 
fact. 
When, 
after 
the 
arrest 
of 
the 
"Decembrists," 
the 
news 
was 
spread 
among 
the 
workers 
of 
the 
Schlüsselburg 

Road 
that 
the 
discovery 
and 
arrest 
were 
facilitated 
by 
an 
agent-provocateur, 


N. 
N. 
Mikhailov, 
a 
dental 
surgeon, 
who 
had 
been 
in 
contact 
with 
a 
group 
associated 
with 
the 
"Decembrists," 
the 
workers 
were 
so 
enraged 
that 
they 
decided 
to 
kill 
him. 
workers 
for 
the 
workers." 
It 
was 
declared 
that 
strike 
funds 
"are 
more 
valuable 
for 
the 
movement 
than 
a 
hundred 
other 
organizations" 
(compare 
this 
statement 
made 
in 
October 
1897 
with 
the 
controversy 
between 
the 
"Decembrists" 
and 
the 
young 
members 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
1897), 
and 
so 
forth. 
Catchwords 
like: 
We 
must 
concentrate 
not 
on 
the 
"cream" 
of 
the 
workers, 
but 
on 
the 
"average," 
mass 
worker: 
"Politics 
always 
obediently 
follows 
economics,"[*] 
etc., 
etc., 
became 
the 
fashion, 
and 
exercised 
an 
irresistible 
influence 
upon 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
youth 
who 
were 
attracted 
to 
the 
movement, 
but 
who, 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
cases, 
were 
acquainted 
only 
with 
such 
fragments 
of 
Marxism 
as 
were 
expounded 
in 
legally 
appearing 
publications. 


Consciousness 
was 
completely 
overwhelmed 
by 
spontaneity 
--the 
spontaneity 
of 
the 
"Social-Democrats" 
who 
repeated 
Mr. 
V. 
V.'s 
"ideas," 
the 
spontaneity 
of 
those 
workers 
who 
were 
carried 
away 
by 
the 
arguments 
that 
a 
kopek 
added 
to 
a 
ruble 
was 
worth 
more 
than 
Socialism 
and 
politics, 
and 
that 
they 
must 
"fight, 
knowing 
that 
they 
are 
fighting 
not 
for 
some 
future 
generation, 
but 
for 
themselves 
and 
their 
children." 
(Leading

Phrases 
like 
these 
have 
always 
been 
the 
favourite 
weapons 
of 
the 
West-European 
bourgeoisie, 
who, 
in 
their 
hatred 
for 
Socialism, 
strove 
(like 
the 
German 
"Sozial-Politiker" 
Hirsch) 
to 
transplant 
English 
trade 
unionism 
to 
their 
native 
soil 
and

These 
quotations 
are 
taken 
from 
the 
leading 
article 
in 
the 
first 
number 
of 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
already 
referred 
to. 
One 
can 
judge 
from 
this 
the 
degree 
of 
theoretical 
training 
possessed 
by 
these 
"V. 
V.'s 
of 
Russian 
Social-Democracy,''[51] 
who 
kept 
repeating 
the 
crude 
vulgarization 
of 
"economic 
materialism" 
at 
a 
time 
when 
the 
Marxists 
were 
carrying 
on 
a 
literary 
war 
against 
the 
real 
Mr. 
V. 
V., 
who 
had 
long 
ago 
been 
dubbed 
"a 
past 
master 
of 
reactionary 
deeds," 
for 
holding 
similar 
views 
on 
the 
relations 
between 
politics 
and 
economics! 
preach 
to 
the 
workers 
that 
by 
engaging 
in 
the 
purely 
trade 
union 
struggle[*] 
they 
would 
be 
fighting 
for 
themselves 
and 
for 
their 
children, 
and 
not 
for 
some 
future 
generation 
with 
some 
future 
Socialism. 
And 
now 
the 
"V. 
V.'s 
of 
Russian 
Social-Democracy" 
have 
set 
about 
repeating 
these 
bourgeois 
phrases. 
It 
is 
important 
at 
this 
point 
to 
note 
three 
circumstances 
which 
will 
be 



useful 
to 
us 
in 
our 
further 
analysis 
of 
contemporary 
differences.[**] 


First 
of 
all, 
the 
overwhelming 
of 
consciousness 
by 
spontaneity, 
to 
which 
we 
referred 
above, 
also 
took 
place 
spontaneously. 
This 
may 
sound 
like 
a 
pun, 
but, 
alas, 
it 
is 
the 
bitter 
truth. 
It 
did 
not 
take 
place 
as 
a 
result 
of 
an 
open 
struggle 
between 
two 
diametrically 
opposed 
points 
of 
view, 
in 
which 
one 
triumphed 
over 
the 
other; 
it 
occurred 
because 
an 
increasing 
number 
of 
"old" 
revolutionaries 
were 
"torn 
away" 
by 
the 
gendarmes 
and 
because 
increasing 
numbers 
of 
"young" 
"V.V.'s 
of 
Russian 
Social-Democracy" 
appeared 
on 
the 
scene. 
Everyone, 
who 
--I 
shall 
not 
say 
has 
participated 
in 
the 
contemporary 
Russian 
movement? 
but 
has 
at 
least 
breathed 
its 
atmosphere 
--knows 
perfectly 
well 
that 
this 
is 
precisely 
the 
case. 
And 
the 
reason 
why 
we, 
nevertheless, 
strongly 
insist 
that 
the 
reader 
be 
fully 
clear 
on 
this 
universally 
known 
fact, 
and 
why 
in 
order 
to 
be 
quite 
explicit, 
so 
to 
speak, 
we 
cite 
the 
details 
concerning 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
as 
it 
first 
appeared, 
and 
concerning 
the 
controversy 
between 
the 
"old" 


* 
The 
Germans 
even 
have 
a 
special 
expression: 
"Nur-
Gewerkschaftler," 
which 
means 
an 
advocate 
of 
the 
"purely 
trade 
union" 
struggle. 
** 
We 
emphasize 
the 
word 
contemporary 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
those 
who 
may 
pharisaically 
shrug 
their 
shoulders 
and 
say: 
it 
is 
easy 
enough 
to 
attack 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
now, 
but 
is 
not 
all 
this 
ancient 
history? 
Mutato 
nomine 
de 
te 
fabula 
narratur 
(change 
the 
name 
and 
the 
tale 
refers 
to 
you 
-Tr.), 
we 
reply 
to 
such 
contemporary 
pharisees 
whose 
complete 
subjection 
to 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
will 
be 
proved 
further 
on. 
and 
the 
"young" 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
1897 
--is 
that 
certain 
persons 
are 
speculating 
on 
the 
public's 
(or 
the 
very 
youthful 
youths') 
ignorance 
of 
this 
fact, 
and 
are 
boasting 
of 
their 
"democracy." 
We 
shall 
return 
to 
this 
point 
further 
on. 


Secondly, 
in 
the 
very 
first 
literary 
manifestation 
of 
Economism, 
we 
can 
already 
observe 
the 
extremely 
curious 
phenomenon 
--one 
highly 
characteristic 
for 
an 
understanding 
of 
all 
the 
differences 
prevailing 
among 
contemporary 
Social-Democrats 
--that 
the 
adherents 
of 
the 
"pure" 
working-
class 
movement, 
the 
worshippers 
of 
the 
closest 
"organic" 
(the 
term 
used 
by 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo) 
contacts 
with 
the 
proletarian 
struggle, 
the 
opponents 
of 
any 
non-worker 
intelligentsia 
(even 
if 
it 
be 
a 
socialist 
intelligentsia) 
are 
compelled, 
in 
order 
to 
defend 
their 
positions, 
to 
resort 
to 
the 
arguments 
of 
the 
bourgeois 
"pure" 
trade 
unionists. 
This 
shows 
that 
from 
the 
very 
outset 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
began 
--unconsciously 
--to 
carry 
out 
the 
program 
of 



the 
Credo. 
This 
shows 
(something 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
cannot 
understand 
at 
all) 
that 
all 
worship 
of 
the 
spontaneity 
of 
the 
working-class 
movement, 
all 
belittling 
of 
the 
role 
of 
"the 
conscious 
element," 
of 
the 
role 
of 
Social-
Democracy, 
means, 
quite 
irrespective 
of 
whether 
the 
belittler 
wants 
to 
or 
not, 
strengthening 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
bourgeois 
ideology 
over 
the 
workers. 
All 
those 
who 
talk 
about 
"overrating 
the 
importance 
of 
ideology,"* 
about 
exaggerating 
the 
role 
of 
the 
conscious 
element,** 
etc., 
imagine 
that 
the 
pure 
working-class 
movement 
can 
work 
out, 
and 
will 
work 
out, 
an 
independent 
ideology 
for 
itself, 
if 
only 
the 
workers 
"wrest 
their 
fate 
from 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
leaders." 
But 
this 
is 
a 
profound 
mistake.

what 
has 
been 
said 
above, 
we 
shall 
quote 
the 
following 
profoundly 
just 
and 
important 
utterances 
by 
Karl 
Kautsky 
on 
the 
new 
draft 
program 
of 
the 
Austrian 
Social-Democratic 
Party:[*] 


"Many 
of 
our 
revisionist 
critics 
believe 
that 
Marx 
asserted 
that 
economic 
development 
and 
the 
class 
struggle 
create 
not 
only 
the 
conditions 
for 
socialist 
production, 
but 
also, 
and 
directly, 
the 
consciousness 
(K. 
K.'s 
italics) 
of 
its 
necessity. 
And 
these 
critics 
aver 
that 
England, 
the 
country 
most 
highly 
developed 
capitalistically, 
is 
more 
remote 
than 
any 
other 
from 
this 
consciousness. 
Judging 
from 
the 
draft, 
one 
might 
assume 
that 
this 
allegedly 
orthodox-Marxist 
view, 
which 
is 
thus 
refuted, 
was 
shared 
by 
the 
committee 
that 
drafted 
the 
Austrian 
program. 
In 
the 
draft 
program 
it 
is 
stated: 
'The 
more 
capitalist 
development 
increases 
the 
numbers 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
the 
more 
the 
proletariat 
is 
compelled 
and 
becomes 
fit 
to 
fight 
against 
capitalism. 
The 
proletariat 
becomes 
conscious' 
of 
the 
possibility 
and 
of 
the 
necessity 
for 
Socialism. 
In 
this 
connection 
socialist 
consciousness 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
necessary 
and 
direct 
result 
of 
the 
proletarian 
class 
struggle. 
But 
this 
is 
absolutely 
untrue. 
Of 
course, 
Socialism, 
as 
a 
doctrine, 
has 
its 
roots 
in 
modern 
economic 
relationships 
just 
as 
the 
class 
struggle 
of 
the 
proletariat 
has, 
and, 
just 
as 
the 
latter, 
emerges 
from 
the 
struggle 
against 
the 
capitalist-created 
poverty 
and 
misery 
of 
the 
masses. 
But 
Socialism 
and 
the 
classs 
struggle 
arise 
side 
by 
side 
and 
not 
one 
out 
of 
the 
other; 
each 
arises 
under 
different 
conditions. 
Modern 
socialist 
consciousness 
can 
arise 
only 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
profound 
scientific 
knowledge. 
Indeed, 
modern 
economic 
science 
is 
as 
much 
a 
condition 
for 
socialist 
production 
as, 
say, 
modern 
technology, 
and 
the 
proletariat 
can 
create 
neither 
the 
one 
nor 
the 
other, 
no 
matter 
how 
much 
it 



may 
desire 
to 
do 
so; 
both 
arise 
out 
of 
the 
modern 
social 
process. 
The 
vehicle 
of 
science 
is 
not 
the 
proletariat, 
but 
the 
bourgeois 
intelligentsia 
(K. 
K.'s 
italics): 
it 
was 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
individual 
members 
of 
this 
stratum 
that 
modern 
Socialism 
originated, 
and 
it 
was 
they 
who 
communicated 
it 
to 
the 
more 
intellectually 
developed 
proletarians 
who, 
in 
their 
turn, 
introduce 
it 
into 
the 
proletarian 
class 
struggle 
where 
conditions 
allow 
that 
to 
be 
done. 
Thus, 
socialist 
consciousness 
is 
something 
introduced 
into 
the

Neue 
Zeit, 
1901-02, 
XX, 
I, 
No. 
3, 
p. 
79. 
The 
committee's 
draft 
to 
which 
Kautsky 
refers 
was 
adopted 
by 
the 
Vienna 
Congress 
(at 
the 
end 
of 
last 
year) 
in 
a 
slightly 
amended 
form. 
proletarian 
class 
struggle 
from 
without 
(von 
Aussen 
Hineingetragenes) 
and 
not 
something 
that 
arose 
within 
it 
spontaneously 
(urwüchsig). 
Accordingly, 
the 
old 
Hainfeld 
program 
quite 
rightly 
stated 
that 
the 
task 
of 
Social-Democracy 
is 
to 
imbue 
the 
proletariat 
(literally: 
saturate 
the 
proletariat) 
with 
the 
consciousness 
of 
its 
position 
and 
the 
consciousness 
of 
its 
task 
There 
would 
be 
no 
need 
for 
this 
if 
consciousness 
arose 
of 
itself 
from 
the 
class 
struggle. 
The 
new 
draft 
copied 
this 
proposition 
from 
the 
old 
program, 
and 
attached 
it 
to 
the 
proposition 
mentioned 
above. 
But 
this 
completely 
broke 
the 
line 
of 
thought. 
. 
. 
." 


Since 
there 
can 
be 
no 
talk 
of 
an 
independent 
ideology 
being 
developed 
by 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers 
themselves 
in 
the 
process 
of 
their 
movement* 
the 
only 
choice 
is: 
either 
the 
bourgeois 
or 
the 
socialist 
ideology. 
There 
is 
no 
middle 
course 
(for 
humanity 
has 
not 
created 
a 
"third" 
ideology, 
and, 
moreover, 
in 
a 
society 
torn 
class 
antagonisms 
there 
can 
never 
be 
a 
non-class 
or 
above-class 
ideology. 
Hence, 
to 
belittle 
the 
socialist 
ideology 
in 
any 
way, 
to 
turn 
away 
from 
it 
in 
the 
slightest 
degree 
means 
to 
strengthen 
bourgeois 
ideology. 


* 
This 
does 
not 
mean, 
of 
course, 
that 
the 
workers 
have 
no 
part 
in 
creating 
such 
an 
ideology. 
But 
they 
take 
part 
not 
as 
workers, 
but 
as 
socialist 
theoreticians, 
as 
Proudhons 
and 
Weitlings; 
in 
other 
words, 
they 
take 
part 
only 
when, 
and 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
they 
are 
able, 
more 
or 
less, 
to 
acquire 
the 
knowledge 
of 
their 
age 
and 
advance 
that 
knowledge. 
And 
in 
order 
that 
workingmen 
may 
be 
able 
to 
do 
this 
more 
often, 
every 
effort 
must 
be 
made 
to 
raise 
the 
level 
of 
the 
consciousness 
of 
the 
workers 
generally; 
the 
workers 
must 
not 
confine 
themselves 
to 
the 
artificially 
restricted 
limits 
of 
"literature 
for 
workers" 
but 
should 
learn 
to 
master 
general 
literature 
to 
an 
increasing 
degree. 
It 
would 
be 
even 
more 
true 
to 
say 
"are 
not 
confined," 
instead 
of 
"must 

not 
confine 
themselves," 
because 
the 
workers 
themselves 
wish 
to 
read 
and 
do 
read 
all 
that 
is 
written 
for 
the 
intelligentsia 
and 
it 
is 
only 
a 
few 
(bad) 
intellectuals 
who 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
sufficient 
"for 
the 
workers" 
to 
be 
told 
a 
few 
things 
about 
factory 
conditions, 
and 
to 
have 
repeated 
to 
them 
over 
and 
over 
again 
what 
has 
long 
been 
known. 


There 
is 
a 
lot 
of 
talk 
about 
spontaneity, 
but 
the 
spontaneous 
development 
of 
the 
working-class 
movement 
leads 
to 
its 
be 
coming 
subordinated 
to 
the 
bourgeois 
ideology, 
leads 
to 
its 
developing 
according 
to 
the 
program 
of 
the 
Credo, 
for 
the 
spontaneous 
working-class 
movement 
is 
trade 
unionism, 
is 
Nur-Gewerkschaftlerei, 
and 
trade 
unionism 
means 
the 
ideological 
enslavement 
of 
the 
workers 
by 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
Hence, 
our 
task, 
the 
task 
of 
Social-Democracy, 
is 
to 
combat 
spontaneity, 
to 
divert 
the 
working-class 
movement 
from 
this 
spontaneous, 
trade-unionist 
striving 
to 
come 
under 
the 
wing 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
and 
to 
bring 
it 
under 
the 
wing 
of 
revolutionary 
Social-Democracy. 
The 
phrase 
employed 
by 
the 
authors 
of 
the 
"economic" 
letter 
in 
the 
Iskra, 
No. 
12, 
about 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
most 
inspired 
ideologists 
not 
being 
able 
to 
divert 
the 
working-class 
movement 
from 
the 
path 
that 
is 
determined 
by 
the 
interaction 
of 
the 
material 
elements 
and 
the 
material 
environment, 
is 
absolutely 
tantamount 
therefore 
to 
the 
abandonment 
of 
Socialism, 
and 
if 
only 
the 
authors 
of 
this 
letter 
were 
capable 
of 
fearlessly, 
consistently 
and 
thoroughly 
considering 
what 
they 
say, 
as 
everyone 
who 
enters 
the 
arena 
of 
literary 
and 
public 
activity 
should 
do, 
there 
would 
be 
nothing 
left 
for 
them 
but 
to 
"fold 
their 
useless 
arms 
over 
their 
empty 
breasts" 
and 
. 
. 
. 
Ieave 
the 
field 
of 
action 
to 
Messrs. 
the 
Struves 
and 
Prokopoviches 
who 
are 
dragging 
the 
working-class 
movement 
"along 
the 
line 
of 
least 
resistance," 
i.e., 
along 
the 
line 
of 
bourgeois 
trade 
unionism, 
or 
to 
the 
Zubatovs, 
who 
are 
dragging 
it 
along 
the 
line 
of 
clerical 
and 
gendarme 
"ideology." 


Recall 
the 
example 
of 
Germany. 
What 
was 
the 
historical 
service 
Lassalle 
rendered 
to 
the 
German 
working-class 
movement? 
It 
was 
that 
he 
diverted 
that 
movement 
from 
the 
path 


of 
trade 
unionism 
and 
cooperation 
preached 
by 
the 
Progressives 
along 
which 
it 
had 
been 
travelling 
spontaneously 
(with 
the 
benign 
assistance 
of 
Schulze-Delitzsch 
and 
those 
like 
him 
). 
To 
fulfil 
a 
task 
like 
that 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
do 
something 
altogether 
different 
from 
indulging 
in 
talk 
about 
underrating 
the 
spontaneous 
element, 
about 
tactics-as-a-process, 
about 
the 
interaction 
between 
elements 
and 
environment, 
etc. 
A 
fierce 
struggle 
against 



spontaneity 
was 
necessary, 
and 
only 
after 
such 
a 
struggle, 
extending 
over 
many 
years, 
was 
it 
possible, 
for 
instance, 
to 
convert 
the 
working 
population 
of 
Berlin 
from 
a 
bulwark 
of 
the 
Progressive 
Party 
into 
one 
of 
the 
finest 
strongholds 
of 
Social-Democracy. 
This 
fight 
is 
by 
no 
means 
finished 
even 
now 
(as 
might 
seem 
to 
those 
who 
learn 
the 
history 
of 
the 
German 
movement 
from 
Prokopovich, 
and 
its 
philosophy 
from 
Struve). 
Even 
now 
the 
German 
working 
class 
is, 
so 
to 
speak, 
broken 
up 
among 
a 
number 
of 
ideologies. 
A 
section 
of 
the 
workers 
is 
organized 
in 
Catholic 
and 
monarchist 
labour 
unions; 
another 
section 
is 
organized 
in 
the 
Hirsch-Duncker 
unions,[52] 
founded 
by 
the 
bourgeois 
worshippers 
of 
English 
trade 
unionism, 
while 
a 
third 
section 
is 
organized 
in 
Social-Democratic 
trade 
unions. 
The 
last 
is 
immeasurably 
more 
numerous 
than 
all 
the 
rest, 
but 
the 
Social 
Democratic 
ideology 
was 
able 
to 
achieve 
this 
superiority, 
and 
will 
be 
able 
to 
maintain 
it, 
only 
by 
unswervingly 
fighting 
against 
all 
other 
ideologies. 


But 
why, 
the 
reader 
will 
ask, 
does 
the 
spontaneous 
movement, 
the 
movement 
along 
the 
line 
of 
the 
least 
resistance, 
lead 
to 
the 
domination 
of 
the 
bourgeois 
ideology? 
For 
the 
simple 
reason 
that 
the 
bourgeois 
ideology 
is 
far 
older 
than 
the 
socialist 
ideology; 
because 
it 
is 
more 
fully 
developed 
and 
because 
it 
possesses 
immeasurably 
more 
op


portunities 
for 
being 
spread.[*] 
And 
the 
younger 
the 
socialist 
movement 
is 
in 
any 
given 
country, 
the 
more 
vigorously 
must 
it 
fight 
against 
all 
attempts 
to 
entrench 
non-socialist 
ideology, 
and 
the 
more 
strongly 
must 
the 
workers 
be 
warned 
against 
those 
bad 
counsellors 
who 
shout 
against 
"overrating 
the 
conscious 
element," 
etc. 
The 
authors 
of 
the 
economic 
letter, 
in 
unison 
with 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
declaim 
against 
the 
intolerance 
that 
is 
characteristic 
of 
the 
infancy 
of 
the 
movement. 
To 
this 
we 
reply: 
yes, 
our 
movement 
is 
indeed 
in 
its 
infancy, 
and 
in 
order 
that 
it 
may 
grow 
up 
the 
more 
quickly, 
it 
must 
become 
infected 
with 
intolerance 
against 
those 
who 
retard 
its 
growth 
by 
their 
subservience 
to 
spontaneity. 
Nothing 
is 
so 
ridiculous 
and 
harmful 
as 
pretending 
that 
we 
are 
"old 
hands" 
who 
have 
long 
ago 
experienced 
all 
the 
decisive 
episodes 
of 
the 
struggle. 


Thirdly, 
the 
first 
number 
of 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
shows 
that 
the 
term 
"Economism" 
(which, 
of 
course, 
we 
do 
not 
propose 
to 
abandon 
because, 
however 
it 
may 
be, 
this 
appellation 
has 
already 
established 
itself) 
does 
not 
adequately 
convey 
the 
real 
character 
of 
the 
new 
trend. 
The 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
does 
not 
altogether 
repudiate 
the 
political 
struggle: 
the 
rules 


* 
It 
is 
often 
said: 
the 
working 
class 
spontaneously 
gravitates 
towards 

Socialism. 
This 
is 
perfectly 
true 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
socialist 
theory 
defines 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
misery 
of 
the 
working 
class 
more 
profoundly 
and 
more 
correctly 
than 
any 
other 
theory, 
and 
for 
that 
reason 
the 
workers 
are 
able 
to 
assimilate 
it 
so 
easily, 
provided, 
however, 
that 
this 
theory 
does 
not 
itself 
yield 
to 
spontaneity, 
provided 
it 
subordinates 
spontaneity 
to 
itself. 
Usually 
this 
is 
taken 
for 
granted, 
but 
it 
is 
precisely 
this 
which 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
forgets 
or 
distorts. 
The 
working 
class 
spontaneously 
gravitates 
towards 
Socialism, 
but 
the 
more 
widespread 
(and 
continuously 
revived 
in 
the 
most 
diverse 
forms) 
bourgeois 
ideology 
nevertheless 
spontaneously 
imposes 
itself 
upon 
the 
working 
class 
still 
more. 


for 
a 
workers' 
benefit 
fund 
published 
in 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl, 
No. 
1, 
contain 
a 
reference 
to 
combating 
the 
government. 
The 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
believes, 
however, 
that 
"politics 
alwavs 
obediently 
follows 
economics" 
(and 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
gives 
a 
variation 
of 
this 
thesis 
when, 
in 
its 
program, 
it 
asserts 
that 
"in 
Russia 
more 
than 
in 
any 
other 
country, 
the 
economic 
struggle 
is 
inseparable 
from 
the 
political 
struggle"). 
If 
by 
politics 
is 
meant 
Social-Democratic 
politics, 
then 
the 
postulates 
advanced 
by 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
and 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
are 
absolutely 
wrong. 
The 
economic 
struggle 
of 
the 
workers 
is 
very 
often 
connected 
(although 
not 
inseparably) 
with 
bourgeois 
politics, 
clerical 
politics, 
etc., 
as 
we 
have 
already 
seen. 
The 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo's 
postulates 
are 
correct 
if 
by 
politics 
is 
meant 
trade 
union 
politics, 
i.e., 
the 
common 
striving 
of 
all 
workers 
to 
secure 
from 
the 
government 
measures 
for 
the 
alleviation 
of 
the 
distress 
characteristic 
of 
their 
position, 
but 
which 
do 
not 
abolish 
that 
position, 
i.e., 
which 
do 
not 
remove 
the 
subjection 
of 
labour 
to 
capital. 
That 
striving 
indeed 
is 
common 
to 
the 
British 
trade 
unionists 
who 
are 
hostile 
to 
Socialism, 
to 
the 
Catholic 
workers, 
to 
the 
"Zubatov" 
workers, 
etc. 
There 
are 
politics 
and 
politics. 
Thus, 
we 
see 
that 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
does 
not 
so 
much 
deny 
the 
political 
as 
to 
bow 
to 
its 
spontaneity, 
to 
its 
lack 
of 
consciousness. 
While 
fully 
recognizing 
the 
political 
struggle 
(it 
would 
be 
more 
correct 
to 
say 
the 
political 
desires 
and 
demands 
of 
the 
workers), 
which 
arises 
spontaneously 
from 
the 
working-class 
movement 
itself, 
it 
absolutely 
refuses 
independently 
to 
work 
out 
a 
specifically 
Social-Democratic 
policy 
corresponding 
to 
the 
general 
tasks 
of 
Socialism 
and 
to 
contemporary 
conditions 
in 
Russia. 
Further 
on 
we 
shall 
show 
that 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
commits 
the 
same 
error. 



C. 
THE 
SELF-EMANCIPATION 
GROUP 
AND 
THE 
RABOCHEYE 
DYELO 
We 
have 
dealt 
at 
such 
length 
with 
the 
little-known 
and 
now 
almost 
forgotten 
leading 
article 
in 
the 
first 
number 
of 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
because 
it 
was 
the 
first 
and 
most 
striking 
expression 
of 
that 
general 
stream 
of 
thought 
which 
afterwards 
emerged 
into 
the 
light 
of 
day 
in 
innumerable 
streamlets. 
V. 


I. 
was 
absolutely 
right 
when, 
in 
praising 
the 
first 
number 
and 
the 
leading 
article 
of 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl, 
he 
said 
that 
it 
was 
written 
in 
a 
"sharp 
and 
challenging" 
style. 
(Listok 
Rabotnika, 
No. 
9-10, 
p. 
49.) 
Every 
man 
with 
convictions 
who 
thinks 
he 
has 
something 
new 
to 
say 
writes 
"challengingly" 
and 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
make 
his 
views 
stand 
out 
in 
bold 
relief. 
Only 
those 
who 
are 
accustomed 
to 
sitting 
between 
two 
stools 
lack 
"challenge"; 
only 
such 
people 
are 
able 
to 
praise 
the 
challenge 
of 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
one 
day, 
and 
attack 
the 
"challenging 
polemics" 
of 
its 
opponents 
the 
next. 
We 
shall 
not 
dwell 
on 
the 
Special 
Supplement 
to 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
(further 
on 
we 
shall 
have 
occasion, 
on 
various 
points, 
to 
refer 
to 
this 
work, 
which 
expresses 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 
Economists 
more 
consistently 
than 
any 
other) 
but 
shall 
briefly 
mention 
the 
Manifesto 
of 
the 
Self-Emancipation 
of 
the 
Workers 
Group 
(March 
1899, 
reprinted 
in 
the 
London 
Nakanunye, 


[54] 
No. 
7, 
July 
1899). 
The 
authors 
of 
this 
manifesto 
quite 
rightly 
say 
that 
"the 
workers 
of 
Russia 
are 
only 
just 
awakening, 
are 
only 
just 
looking 
around, 
and 
instinctively 
clutch 
at 
the 
first 
available 
means 
of 
struggle." 
But 
from 
this 
they 
draw 
the 
same 
incorrect 
conclusion 
that 
is 
drawn 
by 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl, 
forgetting 
that 
instinctiveness 
is 
that 
unconsciousness 
(spontaneity) 
to 
the 
aid 
of 
which 
Socialists 
must 
come; 
that 
the 
"first 
available 
means 
of 
struggle" 
will 
always 
be, 
in 
modern 
society, 
the 
trade 
union 
means 
of 
struggle, 
and 
the 
"first 
available" 
ideology 
will 
be 
the 
bourgeois 
(trade 
union) 
ideology. 
Similarly, 
these 
authors 
do 
not 
"repudiate" 
politics, 
they 
merely 
say 
(merely!), 
repeating 
what 
was 
said 
by 
Mr. 
V. 
V., 
that 
politics 
is 
the 
superstructure, 
and 
therefore, 
"political 
agitation 
must 
be 
the 
superstructure 
to 
the 
agitation 
carried 
on 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
economic 
struggle; 
it 
must 
arise 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
this 
struggle 
and 
follow 
in 
its 
wake." 


As 
for 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
it 
started 
out 
on 
its 
career 
by 
"defending" 
the 
Economists. 
It 
uttered 
a 
downright 
falsehood 
in 
its 
very 
first 
issue 
(No. 
1, 
pp. 
141-42) 
when 
it 
stated 
that 
it 
"does 
not 
know 
which 
young 
comrades 



Axelrod 
referred 
to" 
in 
his 
well-known 
pamphlet,[*] 
in 
which 
he 
uttered 
a 
warning 
to 
the 
Economists. 
In 
the 
controversy 
that 
flared 
up 
with 
Axelrod 
and 
Plekhanov 
over 
this 
falsehood, 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
was 
compelled 
to 
admit 
that 
"by 
expressing 
perplexity, 
it 
desired 
to 
defend 
all 
the 
younger 
Social-Democrats 
abroad 
from 
this 
unjust 
accusation" 
(Axelrod 
accused 
the 
Economists 
of 
having 
a 
narrow 
outlook). 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
this 
accusation 
was 
absolutely 
just, 
and 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
knows 
perfectly 
well 
that, 
among 
others, 
it 
applied 
to 
V. 
I., 
a 
member 
of 
its 
editorial 
staff. 
Let 
me 
note 
in 
passing 
that 
in 
this 
controversy 
Axelrod 
was 
absolutely 
right 
and 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
was 
absolutely 
wrong 
in 
their 
respective 
interpretations 
of 
my 
pamphlet 
The 
Tasks 
of 
the 
Russian 
Social-Democrats.[55] 
That 
pamphlet 
was 
written 
in 
1897, 
before 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
when 
I 
thought, 
and 
rightly 
thought, 
that 
the 
original 
tendency 
of 
the 
St. 
Petersburg 
League 
of 
Struggle, 
which 
I 
described 
above, 
was 
the 
predominant 
one. 
And 
that

Contemporary 
Tasks

Social-
Democrats,

Gazeta

tendency 
really 
was 
the 
predominant 
one, 
at 
any 
rate 
until 
the 
middle 
of 
1898. 
Consequently, 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
had 
no 
right 
whatever, 
in 
its 
attempt 
to 
refute 
the 
existence 
and 
dangers 
of 
Economism, 
to 
refer 
to 
a 
pamphlet 
which 
expressed 
views 
that 
were 
squeezed 
out 
by 
"Economist" 
views 
in 
St. 
Petersburg 
in 
1897-98.[*] 


But 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
not 
only 
"defended" 
the 
Economists 
--it 
itself 
constantly 
fell 
into 
their 
fundamental 
errors. 
The 
source 
of 
this 
confusedness 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
ambiguity 
of 
the 
interpretation 
given 
to 
the 
following 
thesis 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
program: 
"We 
consider 
that 
the 
most 
important 
phenomenon 
of 
Russian 
life, 
the 
one 
that 
will 
mainly 
determine 
the 
tasks" 
(our 
italics) 
"and 
the 
character 
of 
the 
literary 
activity 
of 
the 
Union, 
is 
the 
mass 
working-class 
movement"(Rabocheye 
Dyelo's 
italics) 
"that 
has 
arisen 
in 
recent 
years." 
That 
the 
mass 
movement 
is 
a 
most 
important 
phenomenon 
is 
a 
fact 
about 
which 
there 
can 
be 
no 
dispute. 
But 
the 
crux 
of 
the 
question 
is, 
how 
is 
one 
to 
understand 
the 
statement 
that 
the 
mass 
working-class 
movement 
will 
"determine 
the 
tasks"? 
It 
may 
be 
interpreted 
in 
one 
of 
two 
ways. 


* 
To 
its 
defence 
of 
the 
first 
untruth 
it 
uttered 
("we 
do 
not 
know 
which 
young 
comrades 
Axelrod 
referred 
to"), 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
added 
a 
second, 

when, 
in 
its 
Reply, 
it 
wrote: 
"Since 
the 
review 
of 
The 
Tasks 
was 
published, 
tendencies 
have 
arisen, 
or 
have 
become 
more 
or 
less 
clearly 
defined 
among 
certain 
Russian 
Social-Democrats, 
towards 
economic 
one-sidedness, 
which 
represent 
a 
step 
backwards 
from 
the 
state 
of 
our 
movement 
as 
described 
in 
The 
Tasks" 
(p. 
9). 
This 
is 
what 
the 
Reply 
says, 
published 
in 
1900. 
But 
the 
first 
number 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
(containing 
the 
review) 
appeared 
in 
April 
1899. 
Did 
Economism 
really 
arise 
only 
in 
1899? 
No. 
The 
year 
1899 
saw 
the 
first 
protest 
of 
the 
Russian 
Social-Democrats 
against 
Economism 
(the 
protest 
against 
the 
Credo). 
Economism 
arose 
in 
1897, 
as 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
very 
well 
knows, 
for 
already 
in 
November 
1898, 
V. 
I. 
was 
praising 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
(see 
the 
Listok 
Rabotnika, 
No. 
9-10). 


Either 
it 
means 
bowing 
to 
the 
spontaneity 
of 
this 
movement, 
i.e., 
reducing 
the 
role 
of 
Social-Democracy 
to 
mere 
subservience 
to 
the 
working-class 
movement 
as 
such 
(the 
interpretation 
given 
to 
it 
by 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl, 
the 
Self-Emancipation 
Group 
and 
other 
Economists); 
or 
it 
means 
that 
the 
mass 
movement 
puts 
before 
us 
new 
theoretical, 
political 
and 
organizational 
tasks, 
far 
more 
complicated 
than 
those 
that 
might 
have 
satisfied 
us 
in 
the 
period 
before 
the 
rise 
of 
the 
mass 
movement. 
The 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
inclined 
and 
still 
inclines 
towards 
the 
first 
interpretation, 
for 
it 
has 
said 
nothing 
definite 
about 
any 
new 
tasks, 
but 
argued 
all 
the 
time 
just 
as 
if 
the 
"mass 
movement" 
relieves 
us 
of 
the 
necessity 
of 
clearly 
appreciating 
and 
fulfilling 
the 
tasks 
it 
sets 
before 
us. 
We 
need 
only 
point 
out 
that 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
considered 
that 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
set 
the 
overthrow 
of 
the 
autocracy 
as 
the 
first 
task 
of 
the 
mass 
working-class 
movement, 
and 
that 
it 
degraded 
this 
task 
(in 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
mass 
movement) 
to 
that 
of 
a 
struggle 
for 
immediate 
political 
demands. 
(Reply, 
p. 
25.) 
We 
shall 
pass 
over 
the 
article 
by 
B. 
Krichevsky, 
the 
editor 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
entitled 
"The 
Economic 
and 
Political 


Struggle 
in 
the 
Russian 
Movement," 
published 
in 
No. 
7 
of 
that 
paper, 
in 
which 
these 
very 
mistakes[*] 
are 
repeated, 
and 
proceed 
directly 
to 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No. 
10. 
We 
shall 
not, 
of 
course, 
enter 
in 
detail 
into 
the 
various 
objections 
raised 
by 
B. 
Krichevsky 
and 
Martynov 
against 
the 
Zarya 
and 
the 
Iskra. 
What 
interests 
us 
here 
solely 
are 
the 
principles 
expounded 
by 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No. 
10. 
For 
example, 
we 
shall 
not 
examine 
the 
curiosity 
--that 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
saw 
a 
"diametrical 
contradiction" 
between 
the 
proposition: 


"Social-Democracy 
does 
not 
tie 
its 
hands, 
it 
does 
not 
restrict 
its 
activities 
to 
some 
one 
preconceived 
plan 
or 
method 
of 
political 
struggle; 
it 



recognizes 
all 
means 
of 
struggle, 
as 
long 
as 
they 
correspond 
to 
the 
forces 
at 


the 
disposal 
of 
the 
Party," 
etc. 
(Iskra, 
No.1)[56] 


and 
the 
proposition: 


"Without 
a 
strong 
organization, 
tested 
in 
the 
political 
struggle 
carried 
on 
under 
all 
circumstances 
and 
in 
all 
periods, 
there 
can 
be 
no 
talk 
of 
a 
systematic 
plan 
of 
activity, 
enlightened 
by 
firm 
principles 
and 
unswervingly 
carried 
out, 
which 
alone 
is 
worthy 
of 
being 
called 
tactics." 
(Iskra, 
No. 
4.)[57] 


To 
confuse 
the 
recognition, 
in 
principle, 
of 
all 
means 
of 
struggle, 
of 
all 
plans 
and 
methods, 
as 
long 
as 
they

For

the

--DJR] 
The 
"stages 
theory," 
or 
the 
theory 
of 
"timid 
zigzags" 
in 
the 
political 
struggle, 
is 
expressed, 
for 
example, 
in 
this 
article, 
in 
the 
following 
way: 
"Political 
demands, 
which 
in 
their 
character 
are 
common 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
Russia, 
should, 
however, 
at 
first" 
(this 
was 
written 
in 
August 
1900!) 
"correspond 
to 
the 
experience 
gained 
by 
the 
given 
stratum" 
(sic!) 
"of 
workers 
in 
the 
economic 
struggle. 
Only 
(!) 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
this 
experience 
can 
and 
should 
political 
agitation 
be 
taken 
up," 
etc. 
(P. 
11.) 
On 
page 
4, 
the 
author, 
protesting 
against 
what 
he 
regards 
as 
the 
absolutely 
unfounded 
charge 
of 
Economist 
heresy, 
pathetically 
exclaims: 
"What 
Social-Democrat 
does 
not 
know 
that 
according 
to 
the 
theories 
of 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
the 
economic 
interests 
of 
various 
classes 
play 
a 
decisive 
role 
in 
history, 
and, 
consequently, 
that 
particularly 
the 
proletariat's 
struggle 
for 
the 
defence 
of 
its 
economic 
interests 
must 
be 
of 
first-rate 
importance 
[cont. 
onto 
p. 
57. 
--DJR] 
in 
its 
class 
development 
and 
struggle 
for 
emancipation?" 
(Our 
italics.) 
The 
word 
"consequently" 
is 
absolutely 
out 
of 
place. 
The 
fact 
that 
economic 
interests 
play 
a 
decisive 
role 
does 
not 
in 
the 
least 
imply 
that 
the 
cconomic 
(i.e., 
trade 
union) 
struggle 
is 
of 
prime 
importance, 
for 
the 
most 
essential, 
the 
"decisive" 
interests 
of 
classes 
can 
be 
satisfied 
only 
by 
radical 
political 
changes 
in 
general. 
In 
particular 
the 
fundamental 
economic 
interests 
of 
the 
proletariat 
can 
be 
satisfied 
only 
by 
a 
political 
revolution 
that 
will 
replace 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie 
by 
the 
dictatorship 
of 
the 
proletariat. 
B. 
Krichevsky 
repeats 
the 
arguments 
of 
the 
"V. 
V.'s 
of 
Russian 
Social-Democracy" 
(i.e., 
politics 
follow 
economics, 
etc.) 
and 
the 
Bernsteinians 
of 
German 
Social-Democracy 
(for 
example, 
by 
arguments 
like 
these, 
Woltmann 
tried 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
workers 
must 
first 
of 
all 
acquire 
"economic 
power" 
before 
they 
can 
think 
about 
political 
revolution) 
. 



pedient 
--with 
the 
demand 
that 
at 
a 
given 
political 
moment, 
if 
we 
are 
to 
talk 
of 
tactics, 
we 
be 
guided 
by 
a 
strictly 
observed 
plan, 
is 
tantamount 
to 
confusing 
the 
recognition 
by 
medical 
science 
of 
various 
methods 
of 
treatment 
of 
diseases 
with 
the 
necessity 
for 
adopting 
a 
certain 
definite 
method 
of 
treatment 
for 
a 
given 
disease. 
The 
point 
is, 
however, 
that 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
while 
itself 
the 
victim 
of 
a 
disease 
which 
we 
have 
called 
bowing 
to 
spontaneity, 
refuses 
to 
recognize 
any 
"method 
of 
treatment" 
for 
that 
disease. 
Hence, 
it 
made 
the 
remarkable 
discovery 
that 
"tactics-as-a-plan 
contradicts 
the 
fundamental 
spirit 
of 
Marxism" 
(No. 
10, 
p. 
18), 
that 
tactics 
are 
"a 
process 
of 
growth 
of 
Party 
tasks, 
which 
grow 
together 
with 
the 
Party." 
(P. 
11, 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo's 
italics.) 
The 
latter 
remark 
has 
every 
chance 
of 
becoming 
a 
celebrated 
maxim, 
a 
permanent 
monument 
to 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
"trend." 
To 
the 
question: 
whither 
a 
leading 
organ 
replies: 
movement 
is 
a 
process 
of 
altering 
the 
distance 
between 
the 
starting 
point 
and 
subsequent 
points 
of 
the 
movement. 
This 
matchless 
example 
of 
profundity 
is 
not 
merely 
a 
curiosity 
(if 
it 
were, 
it 
would 
not 
be 
worth 
dealing 
with 
at 
length), 
but 
the 
program 
of 
a 
whole 
trend, 
i.e., 
the 
very 
program 
which 
R.M. 
(in 
the 
Special 
Supplement 
to 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
) 
expressed 
in 
the 
words: 
That 
struggle 
is 
desirable 
which 
is 
possible, 
and 
the 
struggle 
which 
is 
possible 
is 
the 
one 
that 
is 
going 
on 
at 
a 
given 
moment. 
This 
is 
precisely 
the 
trend 
of 
unbounded 
opportunism, 
which 
passively 
adapts 
itself 
to 
spontaneity. 


"Tactics-as-a-plan 
contradicts 
the 
fundamental 
spirit 
of 
Marxism!" 
But 
this 
is 
a 
libel 
on 
Marxism; 
it 
means 
turning 
it 
into 
the 
caricature 
of 
Marxism 
that 
was 
set 
up 
by 
the 
Narodniks 
in 
their 
fight 
against 
us. 
It 
means 
belittling 
the 


initiative 
and 
energy 
of 
class-conscious 
fighters, 
whereas 
Marxism, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
gives 
a 
gigantic 
impetus 
to 
the 
initiative 
and 
energy 
of 
the 
Social-
Democrat, 
opens 
up 
for 
him 
the 
widest 
perspectives 
and 
(if 
one 
may 
so 
express 
it) 
places 
at 
his 
disposal 
the 
mighty 
force 
of 
millions 
and 
millions 
of 
workers 
"spontaneously" 
rising 
for 
the 
struggle! 
The 
whole 
history 
of 
international 
Social-Democracy 
seethes 
with 
plans 
advanced 
now 
by 
one, 
now 
by 
another 
political 
leader; 
some 
confirming 
the 
farsightedness 
and 
correct 
political 
and 
organizational 
views 
of 
their 
authors 
and 
others 
revealing 
their 
shortsightedness 
and 
political 
errors. 
At 
the 
time 
when 
Germany 
was 
at 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
turning 
points 
in 
its 
history 
--the 
formation 
of 
the 
Empire, 
the 
opening 
of 
the 
Reichstag 
and 
the 
granting 
of 
universal 
suffrage 
--Liebknecht 
had 
one 
plan 
for 
Social-Democratic 
policy 



and 
work 
in 
general 
and 
Schweitzer 
had 
another. 
When 
the 
Anti-Socialist 
Law 
came 
down 
on 
the 
heads 
of 
the 
German 
Socialists, 
Most 
and 
Hasselmann 
had 
one 
plan, 
they 
were 
prepared 
there 
and 
then 
to 
call 
for 
violence 
and 
terror; 
Höchberg, 
Schramm 
and 
(partly) 
Bernstein 
had 
another: 
they 
began 
to 
preach 
to 
the 
Social-Democrats 
that 
they 
themselves 
had 
provoked 
the 
enactment 
of 
the 
Law 
by 
being 
unreasonably 
bitter 
and 
revolutionary, 
and 
must 
now 
earn 
forgiveness 
by 
their 
exemplary 
conduct. 
There 
was 
yet 
a 
third 
plan 
proposed 
by 
those 
who 
paved 
the 
way 
for 
and 
carried 
out 
the 
publication 
of 
an 
illegal 
organ. 
It 
is 
easy, 
of 
course, 
in 
retrospect, 
many 
years 
after 
the 
fight 
over 
the 
selection 
of 
the 
path 
to 
be 
followed 
has 
ended, 
and 
after 
history 
has 
pronounced 
its 
verdict 
as 
to 
the 
expediency 
of 
the 
path 
selected, 
to 
utter 
profound 
maxims 
about 
the 
growth 
of 
Party 
tasks, 
which 
grow 
together 
with 
the 
Party. 
But 
at 
a 
time 
of 
con


fusion,[*] 
when 
the 
Russian 
"critics" 
and 
Economists 
are 
degrading 
Social-Democracy 
to 
the 
level 
of 
trade 
unionism, 
and 
when 
the 
terrorists 
are 
stronglv 
advocating 
the 
adoption 
of 
"tactics-as-a-plan" 
that 
repeats 
the 
old 
mistakes, 
at 
such 
a 
time, 
to 
confine 
oneself 
to 
such 
profundities, 
means 
simply 
issuing 
oneself 
a 
"certificate 
of 
poverty." 
At 
a 
time 
when 
many 
Russian 
Social-Democrats 
suffer 
from 
lack 
of 
initiative 
and 
energy, 
from 
a 
lack 
of 
"scope 
of 
political 
propaganda, 
agitation 
and 
organization,"[58] 
a 
lack 
of 
"plans" 
for 
a 
broader 
organization 
of 
revolutionary 
work, 
at 
such 
a 
time, 
to 
say: 
"tactics-as-a-plan 
contradicts 
the 
fundamental 
spirit 
of 
Marxism," 
means 
not 
only 
vulgarizing 
Marxism 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
theory, 
but 
also 
dragging 
the 
Party 
backward 
in 
practice. 


The 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
goes 
on 
to 
sermonize: 


"The 
task 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
Social-Democrat 
is 
only 
to 
accelerate 
objective 
development 
by 
his 
conscious 
work; 
not 
to 
obviate 
it 
or 
substitute 
his 
own 
subjective 
plans 
for 
this 
development. 
The 
Iskra 
knows 
all 
this 
in 
theory. 
But 
the 
enormous 
importance 
which 
Marxism 
quite 
justly 
attaches 
to 
conscious 
revolutionary 
work 
causes 
it 
in 
practice, 
owing 
to 
its 
doctrinaire 
view 
of 
tactics, 
to 
belittle 
tbe 
significance 
of 
the 
objective 
or 
the 
spontaneous 
element 
of 
development." 
(P. 
18.) 


Another 
example 
of 
the 
extraordinary 
theoretical 
confusion 
worthy 
of 
Mr. 
V.V. 
and 
that 
fraternity. 
We 
would 
ask 
our 
philosopher: 
how 
may 
a 
deviser 
of 
subjective 
plans 
"belittle" 
objective 
development? 
Obviously 
by 
losing 
sight 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
this 
objective 
development 
creates 
or 
strengthens, 
destroys 
or 
weakens 
certain 
classes, 
strata, 
groups, 
certain 
nations, 
groups 
of 



nations, 
etc., 
and 
in 
this 
way 
serves 
as 
the 


*"Ein 
Jahr 
der 
Verwirrung" 
("Year 
of 
Confusion") 
is 
the 
title 
Mehring 
gave 
to 
the 
chapter 
of 
his 
History 
of 
German 
Social-Democracy 
in 
which 
he 
describes 
the 
hesitancy 
and 
lack 
of 
determination 
displayed 
at 
first 
by 
the 
Socialists 
in 
selecting 
the 
"tactics-as-a-plan" 
for 
the 
new 
situation. 
premise 
for 
a 
definite 
international 
political 
alignment 
of 
forces, 
for 
determining 
the 
position 
of 
revolutionary 
parties, 
etc. 
If 
the 
deviser 
of 
plans 
did 
that, 
his 
guilt 
would 
not 
be 
that 
he 
belittled 
the 
spontaneous 
element, 
but, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
that 
he 
belittled 
the 
conscious 
element, 
for 
he 
would 
then 
show 
that 
he 
lacked 
the 
"consciousness" 
properly 
to 
understand 
objective 
development. 
Hence, 
the 
very 
talk 
about 
"estimating 
the 
relative 
significance" 
(the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo's 
italics) 
of 
spontaneity 
and 
consciousness 
itself 
reveals 
a 
complete 
lack 
of 
"consciousness." 
If 
certain 
"spontaneous 
elements 
of 
development" 
can 
be 
grasped 
at 
all 
by 
human 
understanding, 
then 
an 
incorrect 
estimation 
of 
them 
will 
be 
tantamount 
to 
"belittling 
the 
conscious 
element." 
But 
if 
they 
cannot 
be 
grasped, 
then 
we 
cannot 
know 
them, 
and 
therefore 
cannot 
speak 
of 
them. 
What 
is 
B. 
Krichevsky 
arguing 
about 
then? 
If 
he 
thinks 
that 
the 
Iskra's 
"subjective 
plans" 
are 
erroneous 
(as 
he 
in 
fact 
declares 
them 
to 
be), 
then 
he 
ought 
to 
show 
what 
objective 
facts 
are 
ignored 
in 
these 
plans, 
and 
then 
charge 
the 
Iskra 
with 
a 
lack 
of 
consciousness 
for 
ignoring 
them, 
with, 
to 
use 
his 
own 
words, 
"belittling 
the 
conscious 
element." 
If, 
however, 
while 
being 
displeased 
with 
subjective 
plans 
he 
can 
bring 
forward 
no 
other 
argument 
than 
that 
of 
"belittling 
the 
spontaneous 
element" 
(!!) 
he 
merely 
shows: 
1) 
that 
theoretically 
he 
understands 
Marxism 
à 
la 
the 
Kareyevs 
and 
Mikhailovskys, 
who 
have 
been 
sufficiently 
ridiculed 
by 
Beltov,[59] 
and 
2) 
that, 
practically, 
he 
is 
quite 
pleased 
with 
the 
"spontaneous 
elements 
of 
development" 
that 
have 
drawn 
our 
legal 
Marxists 
towards 
Bernsteinism 
and 
our 
Social-Democrats 
towards 
Economism, 
and 
that 
he 
is 
full 
of 
wrath 
against 
those 
who 
have 
determined 
at 
all 
costs 
to 
divert 
Russian 
Social-Democracy 
from 
the 
path 
of 
"spontaneous" 
development. 


And 
then 
follow 
things 
that 
are 
positively 
funny. 
"Just 
as 
human 
beings 
will 
multiply 
in 
the 
old-fashioned 
way, 
notwithstanding 
all 
the 
discoveries 
of 
natural 
science, 
so 
the 
birth 
of 
a 
new 
social 
order 
will 
come 
about, 
in 
the 
future 
too, 
mainly 
as 
a 
result 
of 
elemental 
outbursts, 
notwithstanding 
all 
the 
discoveries 
of 
social 
science 
and 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
number 
of 
conscious 
fighters." 
(P. 
19.) 
Just 
as 
our 
grandfathers 
in 
their 
old-fashioned 
wisdom 
used 



to 
say: 
"Any 
fool 
can 
bring 
forth 
children," 
today 
the 
"modern 
Socialists" 
(à 
la 
Narcissus 
Tuporylov)[60] 
in 
their 
wisdom 
say: 
Any 
fool 
can 
participate 
in 
the 
spontaneous 
birth 
of 
a 
new 
social 
order. 
We 
too 
are 
of 
that 
opinion. 
All 
that 
is 
required 
for 
participation 
of 
that 
kind 
is 
to 
yield, 
to 
Economism 
when 
Economism 
reigns, 
and 
to 
terrorism 
when 
terrorism 
arises. 
For 
example, 
in 
the 
spring 
of 
this 
year, 
when 
it 
was 
so 
important 
to 
utter 
a 
note 
of 
warning 
against 
infatuation 
with 
terrorism, 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
stood 
in 
amazement, 
confronted 
by 
a 
problem 
that 
was 
"new" 
to 
it. 
And 
now, 
six 
months 
after, 
when 
the 
problem 
has 
become 
less 
topical, 
it, 
at 
one 
and 
the 
same 
time, 
pre 
sents 
us 
with 
the 
declaration: 
"We 
think 
that 
it 
is 
not 
and 
should 
not 
be 
the 
task 
of 
Social-Democracy 
to 
counteract 
the 
rise 
of 
terroristic 
sentiments" 
(Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No. 
10, 
p. 
23), 
and 
the 
congress 
resolution: 
"The 
congress 
regards 
systematic 
and 
aggressive 
terror 
as 
being 
inopportune" 
(Two 
Congresses, 
p. 
18). 
How 
beautifully 
clear 
and 
coherent 
this 
is! 
Not 
to 
counteract, 
but 
to 
declare 
inopportune, 
and 
to 
declare 
it 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
unsystematic 
and 
defensive 
terror 
does 
not 
come 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
"resolution." 
It 
must 
be 
admitted 
that 
a 
resolution 
like 
that 
is 
extremely 
safe 
and 
completely 
insured 
against 
error, 
just 
as 
a 
man 
who 
talks, 
but 
says 
nothing, 
is 
insured 
against 
error! 
And 
all 
that 
is 
required 
to 
frame 
such 
a 
resolution 
is: 
ability 
to 
keep 
at 
the 


tail 
end 
of 
the 
movement. 
When 
the 
Iskra 
ridiculed 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
for 
declaring 
the 
question 
of 
terror 
to 
be 
a 
new 
one,[61] 
the 
latter 
angrily 
accused 
the 
Iskra 
of 
"having 
the 
incredible 
effrontery 
to 
impose 
upon 
the 
Party 
organization 
solutions 
of 
tactical 
questions 
proposed 
by 
a 
group 
of 
emigrant 
writers 
more 
than 
fifteen 
years 
ago" 
(p. 
24). 
Effrontery 
indeed, 
and 
what 
an 
overrating 
of 
the 
conscious 
element 
--first 
to 
find 
the 
theoretical 
solutions 
to 
problems, 
and 
then 
to 
try 
to 
prove 
to 
the 
organization, 
to 
the 
Party 
and 
to 
the 
masses 
that 
this 
solution 
is 
correct![*] 
How 
much 
better 
it 
would 
be 
to 
repeat 
something 
that 
has 
been 
learned 
by 
rote, 
and, 
without 
"imposing" 
anything 
upon 
anybody, 
swing 
with 
every 
"turn" 
--whether 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
Economism 
or 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
terrorism. 
The 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
even 
generalizes 
this 
great 
precept 
of 
worldly 
wisdom 
and 
accuses 
the 
Iskra 
and 
the 
Zarya 
of 
"setting 
up 
their 
program 
against 
the 
movement, 
like 
a 
spirit 
hovering 
over 
the 
formless 
chaos." 
(P. 
29.) 
But 
what 
else 
is 
the 
function 
of 
Social-Democracy 
if 
not 
to 
be 
a 
"spirit," 
not 
only 
hovering 
over 
the 
spontaneous 
movement, 
but 
also 
raising 
this 
movement 
to 
the 
level 
of 
"its 
program"? 
Surely, 
it 
is 
not 
its 
function 
to 
drag 
at 
the 
tail 
of 
the 
movement: 
at 



best, 
this 
would 
be 
of 
no 
service 
to 
the 
movement; 
at 
the 
worst, 
it 
would 
be 
very, 
very 
harmful. 
The 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
however, 
not 
only 
follows 
this 
''tactics-as-a-process," 
but 
elevates 
it 
to 
a 
principle, 
so 
that 
it 
would 
be 
more 
correct 
to 
describe 
its 
tendency 
not 
as 
opportunism, 
but 
as 
tail-ism 
(from 
the 
word 
tail). 
And 
it 
must 
be 
admitted 
that 
those 
who 
have 
determined 
always 
to 
follow 
behind 
the 


* 
Nor 
must 
it 
be 
forgotten 
that 
in 
solving 
"theoretically" 
the 
problem 
of 
terror, 
the 
Emancipation 
of 
Labour 
group 
generalized 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
preceding 
revolutionary 
movement. 
movement 
and 
be 
its 
tail 
are 
absolutely 
and 
forever 
ensured 
against 
"belittling 
the 
spontaneous 
element 
of 
development." 


*** 


And 
so, 
we 
have 
become 
convinced 
that 
the 
fundamental 
error 
committed 
by 
the 
"new 
trend" 
in 
Russian 
Social-Democracy 
lies 
in 
its 
bowing 
to 
spontaneity, 
and 
its 
failure 
to 
understand 
that 
the 
spontaneity 
of 
the 
masses 
demands 
a 
mass 
of 
consciousness 
from 
us 
Social-Democrats. 
The 
greater 
the 
spontaneous 
upsurge 
of 
the 
masses, 
the 
more 
widespread 
the 
movement 
becomes, 
so 
much 
the 
more 
rapidly, 
incomparably 
more 
rapidly, 
grows 
the 
demand 
for 
greater 
consciousness 
in 
the 
theoretical, 
political 
and 
organizational 
work 
of 
Social-Democracy. 


The 
spontaneous 
upsurge 
of 
the 
masses 
in 
Russia 
proceeded 
(and 
continues) 
with 
such 
rapidity 
that 
the 
young 
Social 
Democrats 
proved 
unprepared 
for 
these 
gigantic 
tasks. 
This 
unpreparedness 
is 
our 
common 
misfortune, 
the 
misfortune 
of 
all 
Russian 
Social-Democrats. 
The 
upsurge 
of 
the 
masses 
proceeded 
and 
spread 
uninterruptedly 
and 
with 
continuity; 
it 
not 
only 
continued 
in 
the 
places 
where 
it 
began, 
but 
spread 
to 
new 
localities 
and 
to 
new 
strata 
of 
the 
population 
(under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
working-class 
movement, 
there 
was 
a 
revival 
of 
ferment 
among 
the 
students, 
the 
intellectuals 
generally 
and 
even 
among 
the 
peasantry). 
Revolutionaries, 
however, 
lagged 
behind 
this 
upsurge 
both 
in 
their 
"theories" 
and 
in 
their 
activity; 
they 
failed 
to 
establish 
an 
uninterrupted 
organization 
having 
continuity 
with 
the 
past, 
and 
capable 
of 
leading 
the 
whole 
movement. 


In 
Chapter 
I, 
we 
proved 
that 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
belittled 
our 
theoretical 
tasks 
and 
that 
it 
"spontaneously" 
repeated 
the 
fashionable 
catchword 
"freedom 
of 
criticism": 
that 
those 
who 
repeated 
this 
catchword 
lacked 
the 
"consciousness" 
to 
understand 
how 
diametrically 



opposed 
are 
the 
positions 
of 
the 
opportunist 
"critics" 
and 
the 
revolutionaries 
in 
Germany 
and 
in 
Russia. 


In 
the 
following 
chapters, 
we 
shall 
show 
how 
this 
worship 
of 
spontaneity 
found 
exprcssion 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
political 
tasks 
and 
the 
organizational 
work 
of 
Social-Democracy. 



III. 
Trade-Unionist 
Politics 
And 
Social-Democratic 
Politics 

We 
shall 
start 
off 
again 
by 
praising 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo. 
"Exposure 
Literature 
and 
the 
Proletarian 
Struggle" 
is 
the 
title 
Martynov 
gave 
his 
article 
in 
No. 
10 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
on 
his 
differences 
with 
the 
Iskra. 
He 
formulated 
the 
substance 
of 
these 
differences 
as 
follows: 
"We 
cannot 
confine 
ourselves 
entirely 
to 
exposing 
the 
system 
that 
stands 
in 
its" 
(the 
working-
class 
party's) 
"path 
of 
development. 
We 
must 
also 
react 
to 
the 
immediate 
and 
current 
interests 
of 
the 
proletariat." 
(P. 
63.) 
" 
. 
. 
. 
the 
Iskra

is 
in 
fact 
an 
organ 
of

of 
affairs 
in 
our 
country, 
particularly 
the 
political 
state 
of 
affairs. 
. 
. 
. 
We, 
however, 
work 
and 
shall 
continue 
to 
work 
for 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
working 
class 
in 
close 
organic 
contact 
with 
the 
proletarian 
struggle." 
(P. 
63.) 
One 
cannot 
help 
being 
grateful 
to 
Martynov 
for 
this 
formula. 
It 
is 
of 
outstanding 
general 
interest 
because 
substantially 
it 
embraces 
not 
only 
our 
disagreements 
with 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
but 
the 
general 
disagreement 
between 
ourselves 
and 
the 
"Econ


omists" 
concerning 
the 
political 
struggle. 
We 
have 
already 
shown 
that 
the 
"Economists" 
do 
not 
altogether 
repudiate 
"politics," 
but 
that 
they 
are 
constantly 
straying 
from 
the 
Social-Democratic 
to 
the 
trade-unionist 
conception 
of 
politics. 
Martynov 
strays 
in 
exactly 
the 
same 
way, 
and 
we 
agree, 
therefore, 
to 
take 
his 
views 
as 
a 
model 
of 
Economist 
error 
on 
this 
question. 
As 
we 
shall 
endeavour 
to 
prove, 
neither 
the 
authors 
of 
the 
Special 
Supplement 
to 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl, 
nor 
the 
authors 
of 
the 
manifesto 
issued 
by 
the 
Self-Emancipation 
Group, 
nor 
the 
authors 
of 
the 
Economist 
letter 
published 
in 
the 
Iskra, 
No. 
12, 
will 
have 
any 
right 
to 
complain 
against 
this 
choice. 



A. 
POLITICAL 
AGITATION 
AND 
ITS 
RESTRICTION 
BY 
THE 
ECONOMISTS 
Everyone 
knows 
that 
the 
extensive 
spread 
and 
consolidation 
of 
the 
economic* 
struggle 
of 
the 
Russian 
workers 
proceeded 
simultaneously 
with 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
"literature" 
exposing 
economic 
conditions, 
i.e., 
factory 
and 
industrial 
conditions. 
These 
"leaflets" 
were 
devoted 
mainly 
to 
the 
exposure 
of 
factory 
conditions, 
and 
very 
soon 
a 
veritable 
passion 
for 
exposures 
was 
roused 
among 
the 
workers. 
As 
soon 
as 
the 
workers 
realized 
that 
the 
Social-
Democratic 
circles 
desired 
to 
and 
could 
supply 
them 
with 
a 
new 
kind 
of 
leaflet 
that 


* 
To 
avoid 
misunderstanding 
we 
must 
point 
out 
that 
here 
and 
throughout 
this 
pamphlet, 
by 
economic 
struggle 
we 
imply 
(in 
accordance 
with 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
term 
as 
accepted 
among 
us) 
the 
"practical 
economic 
struggle" 
which 
Engels, 
in 
the 
passage 
quoted 
above, 
described 
as 
"resistance 
to 
the 
capitalists," 
and 
which 
in 
free 
countries 
is 
known 
as 
the 
professional, 
syndical 
or 
trade 
union 
struggle. 
told 
the 
whole 
truth 
about 
their 
life 
of 
poverty, 
about 
their 
excessive 
toil 
and 
their 
lack 
of 
rights, 
correspondence 
began 
to 
pour 
in 
from 
the 
factories 
and 
workshops. 
This 
"exposure 
literature" 
created 
a 
huge 
sensation 
not 
only 
in 
the 
particular 
factory, 
the 
conditions 
of 
which 
were 
exposed 
in 
the 
given 
leaflet, 
but 
in 
all 
the 
factories 
to 
which 
news 
spread 
about 
the 
facts 
exposed. 
And 
as 
the 
poverty 
and 
want 
among 
the 
workers 
in 
the 
various 
enterprises 
and 
in 
the 
various 
trades 
are 
much 
the 
same, 
the 
"truth 
about 
the 
life 
of 
the 
workers" 
stirred 
all. 
Even 
among 
the 
most 
backward 
workers, 
a 
veritable 
passion 
arose 
to 
"go 
into 
print" 
--a 
noble 
passion 
for 
this 
rudimentary 
form 
of 
war 
against 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
contemporary 
social 
system 
which 
is 
based 
upon 
robbery 
and 
oppression. 
And 
in 
the 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
cases 
these 
"leaflets" 
were 
in 
truth 
a 
declaration 
of 
war, 
because 
the 
exposures 
served 
greatly 
to 
agitate 
the 
workers; 
they 
evoked 
among 
them 
the 
common 
demands 
for 
the 
removal 
of 
the 
most 
glaring 
evils 
and 
roused 
in 
them 
a 
readiness 
to 
support 
these 
demands 
with 
strikes. 
Finally, 
the 
employers 
themselves 
were 
compelled 
to 
recognize 
the 
significance 
of 
these 
leaflets 
as 
a 
declaration 
of 
war, 
so 
much 
so 
that 
in 
a 
large 
number 
of 
cases 
they 
did 
not 
even 
wait 
for 
the 
outbreak 
of 
hostilities. 
As 
is 
always 
the 
case, 
the 
mere 
publication 
of 
these 
exposures 
made 
them 
effective, 
and 
they 
acquired 
the 
significance 
of 
a 
strong 
moral 
influence. 
On 
more 
than 
one 
occasion, 
the 



mere 
appearance 
of 
a 
leaflet 
proved 
sufficient 
to 
secure 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
all 
or 
part 
of 
the 
demands 
put 
forward. 
In 
a 
word, 
economic 
(factory) 
exposures 
were 
and 
remain 
an 
important 
lever 
in 
the 
economic 
struggle. 
And 
they 
will 
continue 
to 
retain 
this 
significance 
as 
long 
as 
capitalism 
exists, 
which 
creates 
the 
need 
for 
the 
workers 
to 
defend 
themselves. 
Even 
in 
the 
most 
advanced 
countries 


of 
Europe 
we 
can 
still 
witness 
how 
the 
exposure 
of 
evils 
in 
some 
backward 
trade, 
or 
in 
some 
forgotten 
branch 
of 
domestic 
industry, 
serves 
as 
a 
starting 
point 
for 
the 
awakening 
of 
class 
consciousness, 
for 
the 
beginning 
of 
a 
trade 
union 
struggle, 
and 
for 
the 
spread 
of 
Socialism.[*] 


The 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
Russian 
Social-Democrats 
have 
of 
late 
been 
almost 
entirely 
absorbed 
by 
this 
work 
of 
organizing 
the 
exposure 
of 
factory 
conditions. 
It 
is 
sufficient 
to 
recall 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
to 
see 
to 
what 
extent 
they 
were 
taken 
up 
by 
it. 
So 
much 
so, 
indeed, 
that 
they 
lost 
sight 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
this, 
taken 
by 
itself, 
is 
in 
essence 
still 
not 
Social-Democratic 
work, 
but 
merely 
trade 
union 
work. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
these 
exposures 
merely 
dealt 
with 
the 
relations 
between 
the 
workers 
in 
a 
given 
trade 
and 
their 
employers, 
and 
all 
that 
they 
achieved 
was 
that 
the 
sellers 
of 
labour 
power 
learned 
to 
sell 
their 
"commodity" 
on 
better 
terms 
and 
to 
fight 
the 
purchasers 
over 
a 
purely 
commercial 
deal. 
These 
exposures 
could 
have 
served 
(if 


* 
In 
the 
present 
chapter, 
we 
deal 
only 
with 
the 
political 
struggle, 
in 
its 
broader 
or 
narrower 
meaning. 
Therefore, 
we 
note 
only 
in 
passing, 
merely 
as 
a 
curiosity, 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo's 
charge 
that 
the 
Iskra 
is 
"too 
restrained" 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
economic 
struggle. 
(Two 
Congresses, 
p. 
27, 
rehashed 
by 
Martynov 
in 
his 
pamphlet 
Social-Democracy 
and 
the 
Working 
Class.) 
If 
those 
who 
make 
this 
accusation 
counted 
up 
in 
terms 
of 
hundred 
weights 
or 
reams 
(as 
they 
are 
so 
fond 
of 
doing) 
what 
has 
been 
said 
about 
the 
economic 
struggle 
in 
the 
industrial 
column 
of 
the 
Iskra 
in 
one 
year, 
and 
compared 
this 
with 
the 
industrial 
columns 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
and 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
taken 
together, 
they 
would 
easily 
see 
that 
they 
lag 
behind 
even 
in 
this 
respect. 
Apparently, 
the 
consciousness 
of 
this 
simple 
truth 
compels 
them 
to 
resort 
to 
arguments 
which 
clearly 
reveal 
their 
confusion. 
"The 
Iskra" 
they 
write, 
"willy-nilly 
(! 
) 
is 
compelled 
(! 
) 
to 
reckon 
with 
the 
imperative 
demands 
of 
life 
and 
to 
publish 
at 
least 
(!! 
) 
correspondence 
about 
the 
working-class 
movement." 
(Two 
Congresses, 
p. 
27.) 
Now 
this 
is 
really 
a 
crushing 
argument! 
properly 
utilized 
by 
an 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries) 
as 
a 
beginning 



and 
a 
constituent 
part 
of 
Social-Democratic 
activity, 
but 
they 
could 
also 
have 
led 
(and, 
given 
a 
worshipful 
attitude 
towards 
spontaneity, 
were 
bound 
to 
lead) 
to 
a 
"pure" 
trade 
union 
struggle 
and 
to 
a 
non-Social-Democratic 
working-class 
movement. 
Social-Democracy 
leads 
the 
struggle 
of 
the 
working 
class 
not 
only 
for 
better 
terms 
for 
the 
sale 
of 
labour 
power, 
but 
also 
for 
the 
abolition 
of 
the 
social 
system 
which 
compels 
the 
propertyless 
to 
sell 
themselves 
to 
the 
rich. 
Social-Democracy 
represents 
the 
working 
class 
not 
in 
the 
latter's 
relation 
to 
only 
a 
given 
group 
of 
employers, 
but 
in 
its 
relation 
to 
all 
classes 
of 
modern 
society, 
to 
the 
state 
as 
an 
organized 
political 
force. 
Hence, 
it 
follows 
that 
Social-Democrats 
not 
only 
must 
not 
confine 
themselves 
entirely 
to 
the 
economic 
struggle; 
they 
must 
not 
even 
allow 
the 
organization 
of 
economic 
exposures 
to 
become 
the 
predominant 
part 
of 
their 
activities. 
We 
must 
actively 
take 
up 
the 
political 
education 
of 
the 
working 
class 
and 
the 
development 
of 
its 
political 
consciousness. 
Now 
that 
the 
Zarya 
and 
the 
Iskra 
have 
made 
the 
first 
attack 
upon 
Economism, 
"all 
are 
agreed" 
on 
this 
(although 
some 
agree 
only 
in 
words, 
as 
we 
shall 
soon 
see). 


The 
question 
arises: 
what 
should 
political 
education 
consist 
of? 
Can 
it 
be 
confined 
to 
the 
propaganda 
of 
working-class 
hostility 
to 
the 
autocracy? 
Of 
course 
not. 
It 
is 
not 
enough 
to 
explain 
to 
the 
workers 
that 
they 
are 
politically 
oppressed 
(no 
more 
than 
it 
was 
to 
explain 
to 
them 
that 
their 
interests 
were 
antagonistic 
to 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
employers). 
Agitation 
must 
be 
conducted 
over 
every 
concrete 
example 
of 
this 
oppression 
(in 
the 
same 
way 
that 
we 
have 
begun 
to 
conduct 
agitation 
around 
concrete 
examples 
of 
economic 
oppression). 
And 
inasmuch 
as 
this 
oppression 
affects 
the 
most 
diverse 


classes 
of 
society, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
manifests 
itself 
in 
the 
most 
varied 
spheres 
of 
life 
and 
activity, 
industrial, 
civic, 
personal, 
family, 
religious, 
scientific, 
etc., 
etc., 
is 
it 
not 
evident 
that 
we 
shall 
not 
be 
fulfilling 
our 
task 
of 
developing 
the 
political 
consciousness 
of 
the 
workers 
if 
we 
do 
not 
undertake 
the 
organization 
of 
the 
political 
exposure 
of 
the 
autocracy 
in 
all 
its 
aspects? 
In 
order 
to 
carry 
on 
agitation 
around 
concrete 
examples 
of 
oppression, 
these 
examples 
must 
be 
exposed 
(just 
as 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
expose 
factory 
abuses 
in 
order 
to 
carry 
on 
economic 
agitation). 


One 
would 
think 
that 
this 
was 
clear 
enough. 
It 
turns 
out, 
however, 
that 
it 
is 
only 
in 
words 
that 
"all" 
are 
agreed 
on 
the 
need 
to 
develop 
political 
consciousness, 
in 
all 
its 
aspects. 
It 
turns 
out 
that 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
for 
example, 
far 
from 
tackling 
the 
task 
of 
organizing 
(or 
making 
a 
start 
in 
organizing) 
comprehensive 
political 
exposure, 
is 
even 
trying 



to 
drag 
the 
Iskra, 
which 
has 
undertaken 
this 
task, 
away 
from 
it. 
Listen 
to 
this: 
"The 
political 
struggle 
of 
the 
working 
class 
is 
merely" 
(it 
is 
precisely 
not 
"merely") 
"the 
most 
developed, 
widest 
and 
most 
effective 
form 
of 
economic 
struggle." 
(Program 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
published 
in 
No. 
1, 
p. 
3.) 
"The 
Social-Democrats 
are 
now 
confronted 
with 
the 
task 
of, 
as 
far 
as 
possible, 
lending 
the 
economic 
struggle 
itself 
a 
political 
character." 
(Martynov, 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No. 
10, 
p. 
42.) 
"The 
economic 
struggle 
is 
the 
most 
widely 
applicable 
means 
of 
drawing 
the 
masses 
into 
active 
political 
struggle." 
(Resolution 
passed 
by 
the 
Congress 
of 
the 
Union 
and 
"amendments" 
thereto, 
Two 
Congresses, 
pp. 
11 
and 
17.) 
As 
the 
reader 
will 
observe, 
all 
these 
postulates 
permeate 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
from 
its 
very 
first 
number 
to 
the 
latest 
"Instructions 
to 
the 
Editors," 
and 
all 
of 
them 
evidently 
ex


press 
a 
single 
view 
regarding 
political 
agitation 
and 
struggle. 
Examine 
this 
view 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
the 
opinion 
prevailing 
among 
all 
Economists, 
that 
political 
agitation 
must 
follow 
economic 
agitation. 
Is 
it 
true 
that, 
in 
general,[*] 
the 
economic 
struggle 
"is 
the 
most 
widely 
applicable 
means" 
of 
drawing 
the 
masses 
into 
the 
political 
struggle? 
It 
is 
absolutely 
untrue. 
All 
and 
sundry 
manifestations 
of 
police 
tyranny 
and 
autocratic 
outrage, 
and 
not 
only 
such 
as 
are 
connected 
with 
the 
economic 
struggle, 
are 
not 
one 
whit 
less 
"widely 
applicable" 
as 
a 
means 
of 
"drawing 
in" 
the 
masses. 
The 
Zemsky 
Nachalniks,[62] 
the 
flogging 
of 
peasants, 
the 
corruption 
of 
the 
officials, 
the 
police 
treatment 
of 
the 
"common 
people" 
in 
the 
cities, 
the 
fight 
against 
the 
famine-stricken 
and 
the 
suppression 
of 
the 
popular 
striving 
towards 
enlightenment 
and 
knowledge, 
the 
extortion 
of 
taxes, 
the 
persecution 
of 
the 
religious 
sects, 
the 
humiliating 
treatment 
of 
the 
soldiers 
and 
the 
treatment 
of 
the 
students 
and 
the 
liberal 
intelligentsia 
as 
if 
they 
were 
soldiers 
--do 
all 
these 
and 
a 
thousand 
other 
similar 
manifestations 
of 
tyranny, 
though 
not 
directly 
connected 
with 
the 
"economic" 
struggle, 
represent, 
in 
general, 
less 
"widely 
applicable" 
means 
and 
occasions 
for 
political 


* 
We 
say 
"in 
general," 
because 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
speaks 
of 
general 
principles 
and 
of 
the 
general 
tasks 
of 
the 
whole 
Party. 
Undoubtedly, 
cases 
occur 
in 
practice, 
when 
politics 
really 
must 
follow 
economics, 
but 
only 
Economists 
can 
say 
a 
thing 
like 
that 
in 
a 
resolution 
intended 
to 
apply 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
Russia. 
Cases 
do 
occur 
when 
it 
is 
possible 
"right 
from 
the 
beginning" 
to 
carry 
on 
political 
agitation 
"exclusively 
on 
an 
economic 
basis"; 
and 
yet 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
hit 
upon 
the 
idea 
that 
"there 
is 
no 
need 
for 
this 

whatever." 
(Two 
Congresses, 
p. 
11) 
In 
the 
next 
chapter, 
we 
shall 
show 
that 
the 
tactics 
of 
the 
"politicians" 
and 
revolutionaries 
not 
only 
do 
not 
ignore 
the 
trade 
union 
tasks 
of 
Social-Democracy, 
but 
that 
on 
the 
contrary, 
they 
alone 
can 
secure 
the 
consistent 
fulfilment 
of 
these 
tasks. 


agitation 
and 
for 
drawing 
the 
masses 
into 
the 
political 
struggle? 
The 
very 
opposite 
is 
true. 
Of 
the 
sum 
total 
of 
the 
cases 
in 
which 
the 
workers 
suffer 
(either 
on 
their 
own 
account 
or 
on 
account 
of 
those 
closely 
connected 
with 
them) 
from 
tyranny, 
violence 
and 
lack 
of 
rights, 
undoubtedly 
only 
a 
small 
minority 
represent 
cases 
of 
police 
tyranny 
in 
the 
economic 
struggle 
as 
such. 
Why 
then 
should 
we, 
beforehand, 
restrict 
the 
scope 
of 
political 
agitation 
by 
declaring 
only 
one 
of 
the 
means 
to 
be 
"the 
most 
widely 
applicable," 
when 
Social-Democrats 
have, 
in 
addition, 
other, 
generally 
speaking, 
no 
less 
"widely 
applicable" 
means? 


Long, 
long 
ago

the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
wrote: 
"The

"immediately

(No.

This 
opportunist 
theory 
of 
stages 
has 
now 
been 
rejected 
by 
the 
Union, 
which 
makes 
a 
concession 
to 
us 
by 
declaring: 
"There 
is 
no 
need 
whatever 
to 
conduct 
political 
agitation 
right 
from 
the 
beginning, 
exclusively 
on 
an 
economic 
basis." 
(Two 
Congresses, 
p. 
11.) 
This 
very 
repudiation 
of 
part 
of 
its 
former 
errors 
by 
the 
Union 
will 
show 
the 
future 
historian 
of 
Russian 
Social-
Democracy 
better 
than 
any 
number 
of 
lengthy 
arguments 
the 
depths 
to 
which 
our 
Economists 
have 
degraded 
Socialism! 
But 
the 
Union 
must 
be 
very 
naive 
indeed 
to 
imagine 
that 
the 
abandonment 
of 
one 
form 
of 
restricting 
politics 
will 
induce 
us 
to 
agree 
to 
another 
form 
of 
restriction! 
Would 
it 
not 
be 
more 
logical 
to 
say, 
in 
this 
case 
too, 
that 
the 
economic 
struggle 
should 
be 
conducted 
on 
the 
widest 
possible 
basis, 
that 
it 
should 
always 
be 
utilized 
for 
political 
agitation, 
but 
that 
"there 
is 
no 
need 
whatever" 
to 
regard 
the 
economic 


struggle 
as 
the 
most 
widely 
applicable 
means 
of 
drawing 
the 
masses 
into 
active 
political 
struggle? 


The 
Union 
attaches 
significance 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
replaced 
the 
phrase 
"most 
widely 
applicable 
means" 
for 
the 
phrase 
"the 
best 
means" 
contained 
in 
one 
of 
the 
resolutions 
of 
the 
Fourth 
Congress 
of 
the 
Jewish 
Workers' 
Union 
(Bund).[63] 
We 
confess 
that 
we 
hnd 
it 
difficult 
to 
say 
which 
of 
these 
resolutions 
is 
the 
better 
one. 
In 
our 
opinion 
both 
are 
"worse." 
Both 
the 
Union 



and 
the 
Bund 
fall 
into 
the 
error 
(partly, 
perhaps, 
unconsciously, 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
tradition) 
of 
giving 
an 
economic, 
trade-unionist 
interpretation 
to 
politics. 
Whether 
this 
is 
done 
by 
employing 
the 
word 
"best" 
or 
the 
words 
"most 
widely 
applicable" 
makes 
no 
material 
difference 
whatever. 
If 
the 
Union 
had 
said 
that 
"political 
agitation 
on 
an 
economic 
basis" 
is 
the 
most 
widely 
applied 
(and 
not 
"applicable") 
means 
it 
would 
have 
been 
right 
in 
regard 
to 
a 
certain 
period 
in 
the 
development 
of 
our 
Social-Democratic 
movement. 
It 
would 
have 
been 
right 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
Economists 
and 
to 
many 
(if 
not 
the 
majority) 
of 
the 
practical 
workers 
of 
1898-1901, 
for 
these 
practical 
Economists 
applied 
political 
agitation 
(to 
the 
extent 
that 
they 
applied 
it 
at 
all!) 
almost 
exclusively 
on 
an 
economic 
basis. 
Political 
agitation 
on 
such 
lines 
was 
recognized 
and, 
as 
we 
have 
seen, 
even 
recommended 
by 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
and 
by 
the 
Self-Emancipation 
Group! 
The 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
should 
have 
strongly 
condemned 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
useful 
work 
of 
economic 
agitation 
was 
accompanied 
by 
the 
harmful 
restriction 
of 
the 
political 
struggle, 
but 
instead 
of 
that, 
it 
declares 
the 
means 
most 
widely 
applied 
(by 
the 
Economists 
) 
to 
be 
the 
most 
widely 
applicable! 
It 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
when 
we 
call 
these 
people 
Economists, 
they 
can 
do 
nothing 
else 
but 
pour 
every 
manner 
of 
abuse 
upon 
us, 
and 
call 
us 
"mystifiers," 
"disrupters," 
"papal 


Nuncios," 
and 
"slanderers,"[*] 
go 
complaining 
to 
the 
whole 
world 
that 
we 
have 
mortally 
offended 
them, 
and 
declare 
almost 
on 
oath 
that 
"not 
a 
single 
Social-Democratic 
organization 
is 
now 
tinged 
with 
Economism."[**]Oh, 
these 
evil, 
slanderous 
politicians! 
They 
must 
have 
deliberately 
invented 
this 
Economism, 
out 
of 
sheer 
hatred 
of 
mankind, 
in 
order 
mortally 
to 
offend 
other 
people! 


What 
real 
concrete 
meaning 
does 
Martynov 
attach 
to 
his 
words 
about 
Social-Democracy 
taking 
up 
the 
task 
of 
"lending 
the 
economic 
struggle 
itself 
a 
political 
character"? 
The 
economic 
struggle 
is 
the 
collective 
struggle 
of 
the 
workers 
against 
their 
employers 
for 
better 
terms 
in 
the 
sale 
of 
their 
labour 
power, 
for 
the 
better 
conditions 
of 
life 
and 
labour. 
This 
struggle 
is 
necessarily 
an 
industrial 
struggle, 
because 
conditions 
of 
labour 
differ 
very 
much 
in 
different 
trades, 
and, 
consequently, 
the 
fight 
to 
improve 
these 
conditions 
can 
only 
be 
conducted 
in 
respect 
to 
each 
trade 
(trade 
unions 
in 
the 
Western 
countries, 
temporary 
trade 
associations 
and 
leaflets 
in 
Russia, 
etc.). 
Lending 
"the 
economic 
struggle 
itself 
a 
political 
character" 
means, 
therefore, 
striving 
to 
secure 
satisfaction 
of 
these 
trade 
demands, 
the 
improvement 
of 
conditions 
of 
labour 
in 
each 
separate 
trade 
by 
means 
of 
"legislative 
and 
administrative 



measures" 
(as 
Martynov 
expresses 
it 
on 
the 
next 
page 
of 
his 
article, 
p. 
43). 
This 
is 
exactly 
what 
all 
workers' 
trade 
unions 
do 
and 
always 
have 
done. 
Read 
the 
works 
of 
the 
thoroughly 
scientific 
(and 
"thoroughly" 
opportunist) 
Mr. 
and 
Mrs. 
Webb 
and 
you 
will 
see 
that 
the 
British 
trade 
unions 
long 
ago 
recognized, 
and 
have 
long 
been 
carrying 
out,

These 
are 
exactly 
thc 
expressions 
used 
in

31,

28 
and 
30.

the 
task 
of 
"lending 
the 
economic 
struggle 
itself 
a 
political 
character"; 
they 
have 
long 
been 
fighting 
for 
the 
right 
to 
strike, 
for 
the 
removal 
of 
all 
legal 
hindrances 
to 
the 
cooperative

for

of

conditions 
by

of

and

etc. 


Thus, 
the 
pompous 
phrase 
about 
"lending 
the 
economic 
struggle 
itself 
a 
political 
character," 
which 
sounds 
so 
"terrifically" 
profound 
and 
revolutionary, 
serves 
as 
a 
screen 
to 
conceal 
what 
is 
in 
fact 
the 
traditional 
striving 
to 
degrade 
Social-Democratic 
politics 
to 
the 
level 
of 
trade 
union 
politics! 
On 
the 
pretext 
of 
rectifying 
the 
one-sidedness 
of 
the 
Iskra, 
which, 
it 
is 
alleged, 
places 
"the 
revolutionizing 
of 
dogma 
higher 
than 
the 
revolutionizing 
of 
life,"[*] 
we 
are 
presented 
with 
the 
struggle 
for 
economic 
reform 
as 
if 
it 
were 
some 
thing 
entirely 
new. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
the 
phrase 
"lending 
the 
economic 
struggle 
itself 
a 
political 
character" 
means 
nothing 
more 
than 
the 
struggle 
for 
economic 
reforms. 
And 
Martynov 
himself 
might 
have 
come 
to 
this 
simple 
conclusion 
had 
he 
only 
pondered 
over 
the 
significance 
of 
his 
own 
words. 
"Our 
Party," 
he 
says, 
turning 
his 
heaviest 
guns 
against 
the 
Iskra, 
"could

should 
have

This 
is 
the 
Martynov 
variation 
of 
the 
application 
to 
the 
present 
chaotic 
state 
of 
our 
movement 
of 
the 
thesis: 
"Every 
step 
of 
real 
movement 
is 
more 
important 
than 
a 
dozen 
programs," 
which 
we 
have 
already 
characterized 
above. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
this 
is 
merely 
a 
translation 
into 
Russian 
of 
the 
notorious 
Bernsteinian 
phrase: 
"The 
movement 
is 
everything, 
the 
final 
aim 
is 
nothing." 
forms? 
And 
again 
we 
ask 
the 
impartial 
reader, 
do 
we 
slander 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo-ites 
(may 
I 
be 
forgiven 
for 
this 
clumsy 
expression!) 
by 



calling 
them 
concealed 
Bernsteinians 
when 
they 
advance, 
as 
their 
point 
of 
disagreement 
with 
the 
Iskra, 
their 
thesis 
about 
the 
necessity 
of 
fighting 
for 
economic 
reforms? 


Revolutionary 
Social-Democracy 
always 
included, 
and 
now 
includes, 
the 
fight 
for 
reforms 
as 
part 
of 
its 
activities. 
But 
it 
utilizes 
"economic" 
agitation 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
presenting 
to 
the 
government, 
not 
only 
demands 
for 
all 
sorts 
of 
measures, 
but 
also 
(and 
primarily) 
the 
demand 
that 
it 
cease 
to 
be 
an 
autocratic 
government. 
More, 
it 
considers 
it 
its 
duty 
to 
present 
this 
demand 
to 
the 
government, 
not 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
economic 
struggle 
alone, 
but 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
all 
manifestations 
in 
general 
of 
public 
and 
political 
life. 
In 
a 
word, 
it 
subordinates 
the 
struggle 
for 
reforms, 
as 
the 
part 
to 
the 
whole, 
to 
the 
revolutionary 
struggle 
for 
liberty 
and 
for 
Socialism. 
Martynov, 
however, 
resuscitates 
the 
theory 
of 
stages 
in 
a 
new 
form, 
and 
strives 
to 
prescribe 
an 
exclusively 
economic, 
so 
to 
speak, 
path 
of 
development 
for 
the 
political 
struggle. 
By 
coming 
out 
at 
this 
moment, 
when 
the 
revolutionary 
movement 
is 
on 
the 
upgrade, 
with 
an 
alleged 
special 
"task" 
of 
fighting 
for 
reforms, 
he 
is 
dragging 
the 
Party 
backwards 
and 
is 
playing 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
both 
"economic" 
and 
liberal 
opportunism. 


To 
proceed. 
While 
shamefacedly 
hiding 
the 
struggle 
for 
reforms 
behind 
the 
pompous 
thesis 
about 
"lending 
the 
economic 
struggle 
itself 
a 
political 
character," 
Martynov 
advanced, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
special 
point, 
exclusively 
economic 
(in 
fact 
exclusively 
factory) 
reforms. 
Why 
he 
did 
that, 
we 
do 
not 
know. 
Perhaps 
it 
was 
due 
to 
carelessness? 
But 
if 
he 
had 
in 
mind 
something 
else 
besides 
"factory" 
reforms, 


then 
the 
whole 
of 
his 
thesis, 
which 
we 
have 
just 
quoted, 
loses 
all 
sense. 
Perhaps 
he 
did 
it 
because 
he 
thinks 
it 
possible 
and 
probable 
that 
the 
government 
will 
make 
"concessions" 
only 
in 
the 
economic 
sphere?[*] 
If 
so, 
then 
it 
is 
a 
strange 
delusion. 
Concessions 
are 
also 
possible 
and 
are 
made 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
legislation 
concerning 
flogging, 
passports, 
land 
compensation 
payments, 
religious 
sects, 
the 
censorship, 
etc., 
etc. 
"Economic" 
concessions 
(or 
pseudo 
concessions) 
are, 
of 
course, 
the 
cheapest 
and 
most 
advantageous 
from 
the 
government's 
point 
of 
view, 
because 
by 
these 
means 
it 
hopes 
to 
win 
the 
confidence 
of 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers. 
For 
this 
very 
reason, 
we 
Social-
Democrats 
must 
not 
under 
any 
circumstances 
or 
in 
any 
way 
whatever 
create 
grounds 
for 
the 
belief 
(or 
the 
misunderstanding) 
that 
we 
attach 
greater 
value 
to 
economic 
reforms, 
or 
that 
we 
regard 
them 
as 
being 
particularly 
important, 
etc. 
"Such 
demands," 
writes 
Martynov 
concerning 
the 
concrete 
demands 
for 



legislative 
and 
administrative 
measures 
referred 
to 
above, 
"would 
not 
be 
merely 
a 
hollow 
sound, 
because, 
promising 
certain 
palpable 
results, 
they 
might 
be 
actively 
supported 
by 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers. 
. 
. 
." 
We 
are 
not 
Economists, 
oh 
no! 
We 
only 
cringe 
as 
slavishly 
before 
the 
"palpableness" 
of 
concrete 
results 
as 
do 
the 
Bernsteins, 
the 
Prokopoviches, 
the 
Struves, 
the 
R.M.'s, 
and 
tutti 
quanti![64] 
We 
only 
wish 
to 
make 
it 
understood 
(with 
Narcissus 
Tuporylov) 
that 
all 
that 
which 
"does 
not 
promise 
palpable 
results" 
is 
merely 
a 
"hollow 
sound"! 
We 
are 
only 
trying 
to 
argue 
as 
if 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers 
were 
incapable 
(and 
had 
not 
already 
proved 
their 
capabilities,

do 
so

"constantly 
places 
the 
revolutionizing 
of 
dogma

than 
the 
revolutionizing 
of 
life," 
tried 
to 
explain 
the 
inseparable 
connection 
between 
unemployment 
and 
the 
whole 
capitalist 
system; 
warned 
that 
"famine 
is 
coming", 
exposed 
the 
police 
"fight 
against 
the

stricken" 
and 
the 
outrageous 
"provisional 
penal 
regulations"; 
and 
the

published 
a 
special 
reprint, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
agitation 
pamphlet, 
of 
a 
section 
of 
its 
"Review 
of 
Internal 
Affairs" 
dealing 
with 
the 
famine.[65] 
But 
good 
God! 
How 
"one-
sided" 
were 
these 
incorrigibly 
narrow 
and 
orthodox 
doctrinaires; 
how 
deaf 
to 
the 
calls 
of 
"life 
itself"! 
Their 
articles 
contained 
--oh 
horror! 
--not 
a 
single, 
can 
you 
imagine 
it? 
--not 
a 
single 
"concrete 
demand," 
"promising 
palpable 
results"! 
Poor 
doctrinaires! 
They 
ought 
to 
be 
sent 
to 
Krichevsky 
and 
Martynov 
to 
be 
taught 
that 
tactics 
are 
a 
process 
of 
growth, 
of 
that 
which 
grows, 
etc., 
and 
that 
the 
economic 
struggle 
itseIf 
should 
be 
given 
a 
political 
character! 


"In 
addition 
to 
its 
immediate 
revolutionary 
significance, 
the 
economic 
struggle 
of 
the 
workers 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government" 



("economic 
struggle 
against 
the 
government"!!) 
"has 
also 
this 
significance: 
it 
constantly 
brings 
it 


home 
to 
the 
workers 
that 
they 
have 
no 
political 
rights." 
(Martynov, 
p. 
44.) 
We 
quote 
this 
passage 
not 
in 
order 
to 
repeat 
for 
the 
hundredth 
and 
thousandth 
time 
what 
has 
already 
been 
said 
above, 
but 
in 
order 
particularly 
to 
thank 
Martynov 
for 
this 
excellent 
new 
formula: 
"the 
economic 
struggle 
of 
the 
workers 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government." 
What 
a 
pearl! 
With 
what 
inimitable 
talent 
and 
skill 
in 
eliminating 
all 
partial 
disagreements 
and 
shades 
of 
differences 
among 
Economists 
does 
this 
clear 
and 
concise 
postulate 
express 
the 
quintessence 
of 
Economism: 
from 
calling 
to 
the 
workers 
to 
join 
"in 
the 
political 
struggle 
which 
they 
carry 
on 
in 
the 
general 
interest, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
improving 
the 
conditions 
of 
all 
the 
workers,"[*] 
continuing 
through 
the 
theory 
of 
stages, 
and 
ending 
in 
the 
resolution 
of 
the 
Congress 
on 
the 
"most 
widely 
applicable," 
etc. 
"Economic 
struggle 
against 
the 
government" 
is 
precisely 
trade-unionist 
politics, 
which 
is 
very, 
very 
far 
from 
being 
Social-Democratic 
politics.

"What

of

observed 
a 
comrade 
one 
day, 
having 
in 
mind 
the 
astonishing 
propensity 
of 
many 
of 
those 
who 
are 
inclined 
towards 
Economism 
to 
arrive, 
"all 
by 
themselves," 
at 
great 
truths 
(for 
example, 
that 
the 
economic 
struggle 
stimulates 
the 
workers 
to 
ponder 
over 
their 
lack 
of 
rights), 
and

contempt 
of 
born 
geniuses, 
all 
that 
has 
already 
been 
produced 
by 
the 
previous 
development 
of 
revolutionary 
thought 
and 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
movement. 
Lomonosov-Martynov 
is 
precisely 
such 
a 
born 
genius. 
Glance 
at 
his 
article, 
"Immediate 
Questions," 
and 
observe 
how 
"all 
by 
himself" 
he 
approaches 
what 
has 
been 
said 
long 
ago 
by 
Axelrod 
(of 
whom 
our 
Lomonosov, 
naturally, 
says 
not 
a 
word); 
how, 
for 
example, 
he 
is 
beginning 
to 
understand 
that 
we 
cannot 
ignore 
the 
opposition 
of 
the 
various 
strata 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie 
(Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No. 
9, 
pp. 
61, 
62, 
71; 
compare 
this 
with 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo's 
Reply 
to 
Axelrod, 
pp. 
22, 
23-24), 
etc. 
But 
alas, 
he 
is 
only 
"approaching" 
and 
is 
only 
"beginning," 
not 
more 
than 
that, 
for 
so 
little 
has 
he 
understood 
Axelrod's 
ideas, 
that 
he 
talks 
about 
"the 
economic 
struggle 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government." 
For 
three 
years 
(1898-1901) 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
has 
tried 
hard 
to 
understand 
Axelrod, 
but 
. 
. 
. 
but 
has 
failed 
to 
do 
so 
yet! 
Perhaps 
one 
of 
the 
reasons 
is 
that 
Social-Democracy, 
"like 
humanity," 
always 
sets 
itself 
only 
tasks 
that 
can 
be 
achieved? 


But 
the 
Lomonosovs 
are 
distinguished 
not 
only 
by 
the 
fact 
of 
their 
ignorance 
of 
many 
things 
(that 
would 
be 
half 
a 
misfortune!), 
but 
also 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
are 
not 
conscious 
of 
their 
ignorance. 
Now 
this 
is 
a 
real 
misfortune; 
and 
it 
is 
this 
misfortune 
that 
prompts 
them 
without 
further 
ado 
to 
attempt 
to 
render 
Plekhanov 
"more 
profound." 


"Much 
water," 
Lomonosov-Martynov 
says, 
"has 
flowed 
under 
the 
bridges 
since 
Plekhanov 
wrote 
this 
book." 
(Tasks 
of 
the 
Socialists 
in 
tbe 
Fight 
Against 
the 
Famine 
in 
Russia.) 
"The 
Social-Democrats 
who 
for 
a 
decade 
led 
the 
economic 
struggle 
of 
the 
working 
class 
. 
. 
. 
have 
failed 
as 
yet 
to 
lay 
down 
a 
broad 
theoretical 
basis 
for 
Party 
tactics. 
This 
question 
has 
now 
come 
to 
a 
head, 
and 
if 
we 
should 
wish 
to 
lay 
down 
such 
a 
theoretical 
basis 
we 
would 
certainly 
have 
to 
deepen 
considerably 
the 
principles 
of 
tactics 
developed 
at 



one 
time 
by 
Plekhanov. 
. 
. 
. 
Our 


present 
definition 
of 
the 
distinction 
between 
propaganda 
and 
agitation 
would 
have 
to 
be 
different 
than 
Plekhanov's." 
(Martynov 
had 
just 
quoted 
Plekhanov's 
words: 
"A 
propagandist 
presents 
many 
ideas 
to 
one 
or 
a 
few 
persons; 
an 
agitator 
presents 
only 
one 
or 
a 
few 
ideas, 
but 
he 
presents 
them 
to 
a 
mass 
of 
people.") 
"By 
propaganda 
we 
would 
understand 
the 
revolutionary 
elucidation 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
present 
system 
or 
partial 
manifestations 
of 
it, 
irrespective 
of 
whether 
it 
is 
done 
in 
a 
form 
intelligible 
to 
individuals 
or 
to 
broad 
masses. 
By 
agitation, 
in 
the 
strict 
sense 
of 
the 
word," 
(sic! 
) 
"we 
would 
understand 
calling 
the 
masses 
to 
certain 
concrete 
actions, 
facilitating 
the 
direct 
revolutionary 
intervention 
of 
the 
proletariat 
in 
social 
life." 


We 
congratulate 
Russian 
--and 
international 
--Social-Democracy 
on 
this 
new, 
Martynov 
terminology 
which 
is 
more 
strict 
and 
more 
profound. 
Up 
to 
now 
we 
thought 
(with 
Plekhanov, 
and 
with 
all 
the 
leaders 
of 
the 
international 
working 
class 
movement) 
that 
a 
propagandist, 
dealing 
with, 
say, 
that 
same 
question 
of 
unemployment, 
must 
explain 
the 
capitalistic 
nature 
of 
crises, 
the 
reasons 
why 
they 
are 
inevitable 
in 
contemporary 
society, 
describe 
the 
need 
for 
its 
transformation 
into 
socialist 
society, 
etc. 
In 
a 
word, 
he 
must 
present 
"many 
ideas," 
so 
many 
indeed 
that 
they 
will 
be 
understood 
as 
an 
integral 
whole 
only 
by 
a 
(comparatively) 
few 
persons. 
An 
agitator, 
however, 
speaking 
on 
the 
same 
subject, 
will 
take 
as 
an 
illustration 
a 
fact 
that 
is 
most 
glaring 
and 
most 
widely 
known 
to 
his 
audience, 
say, 
the 
death 
from 
starvation 
of 
the 
family 
of 
an 
unemployed 
worker, 
the 
growing 
impoverishment, 
etc., 
and 
utilizing 
this 
fact, 
which 
is 
known 
to 
all 
and 
sundry, 
will 
direct 
all 
his 
efforts 
to 
presenting 
a 
single 
idea 
to 
the 
"masses," 
i.e., 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
senselessness 
of 
the 
contradiction 
between 
the 
increase 
of 
wealth 
and 
increase 
of 
poverty; 
he 
will 
strive 
to 
rouse 
discontent 
and 
indignation 
among 
the 
masses 
against 
this 
crying 
injustice, 
and 
leave 
a 
more 
complete 
explanation 
of 
this 
contradiction 
to 
the 
propagandist. 
Consequently, 
the 
propagandist 
operates 
chiefly 
by 


means 
of 
the 
printed 
word; 
the 
agitator 
by 
means 
of 
the 
living 
word. 
The 
propagandist 
must 
possess 
different 
qualities 
than 
the 
agitator. 
Kautsky 
and 
Lafargue, 
for 
example, 
we 
call 
propagandists; 
Bebel 
and 
Guesde 
we 
call 
agitators. 
To 
single 
out 
a 
third 
sphere, 
or 
third 
function, 
of 
practical 
activity, 
and 
to 
include 
in 
this 
function 
"calling 
the 
masses 
to 
certain 
concrete 
actions," 
is 
sheer 
nonsense, 
because 
the 
"call," 
as 
a 
single 
act, 
either 
naturally 
and 
inevitably 
supplements 
the 
theoretical 
tract, 
propagandist 
pamphlet 
and 



agitational 
speech, 
or 
represents 
a 
purely 
executive 
function. 
Take, 
for 
example, 
the 
struggle 
now 
being 
carried 
on 
by 
the 
German 
Social-Democrats 
against 
the 
grain 
duties. 
The 
theoreticians 
write 
research 
works 
on 
tariff 
policy 
and 
"call," 
say, 
for 
a 
fight 
for 
commercial 
treaties 
and 
for 
free 
trade. 
The 
propagandist 
does 
the 
same 
thing 
in 
the 
periodical 
press, 
and 
the 
agitator 
in 
public 
speeches. 
At 
the 
present 
time, 
the 
"concrete 
action" 
of 
the 
masses 
takes 
the 
form 
of 
signing 
petitions 
to 
the 
Reichstag 
against 
the 
raising 
of 
the 
grain 
duties. 
The 
call 
for 
this 
action 
comes 
indirectly 
from 
the 
theoreticians, 
the 
propagandists 
and 
the 
agitators, 
and, 
directly, 
from 
those 
workers 
who 
carry 
the 
petition 
lists 
to 
the 
factories 
and 
to 
private 
homes 
soliciting 
signatures. 
According 
to 
the 
"Martynov 
terminology," 
Kautsky 
and 
Bebel 
are 
both 
propagandists, 
while 
those 
who 
solicit 
the 
signatures 
are 
agitators; 
is 
that 
not 
so? 


The 
German 
example 
recalled 
to 
my 
mind 
the 
German 
word 
"Verballhornung," 
which 
literally 
translated 
means 
"to 
Ballhorn." 
Johann 
Ballhorn, 
a 
Leipzig 
publisher 
of 
the 
sixteenth 
century, 
published 
a 
child's 
reader 
in 
which, 
as 
was 
the 
custom, 
he 
introduced 
a 
drawing 
of 
a 
cock; 
but 
this 
drawing, 
instead 
of 
portraying 
an 
ordinary 
cock 
with 
spurs, 
portrayed 
it 
without 
spurs 
and 
with 
a 
couple 
of 
eggs 
Iying 
near 
it. 
On 
the 
cover 
of 
this 
reader 
he 
printed 
the 
legend 
"Revised 


edition 
by 
Johann 
Ballhorn." 
Since 
that 
time 
the 
Germans 
describe 
any 
"revision" 
that 
is 
really 
a 
worsening 
as 
"Ballhorning." 
And 
you 
cannot 
help 
recalling 
Ballhorn 
when 
you 
see 
how 
the 
Martynovs 
try 
to 
render 
Plekhanov 
"more 
profound." 


Why 
did 
our 
Lomonosov 
"invent" 
this 
confusion? 
In 
order 
to 
illustrate 
how 
the 
Iskra 
"devotes 
attention 
only 
to 
one 
side 
of 
the 
case, 
just 
as 
Plekhanov 
did 
a 
decade 
and 
a 
half 
ago" 
(p. 
39). 
"According 
to 
the 
Iskra, 
propagandist 
tasks 
force 
agitational 
tasks 
into 
the 
background, 
at 
least 
for 
the 
present" 
(p. 
52). 
If 
we 
translate 
this 
last 
proposition 
from 
the 
language 
of 
Martynov 
into 
ordinary 
human 
language 
(because 
humanity 
has 
not 
yet 
managed 
to 
learn 
the 
newly 
invented 
terminology), 
we 
shall 
get 
the 
following: 
According 
to 
the 
Iskra, 
the 
tasks 
of 
political 
propaganda 
and 
political 
agitation 
force 
into 
the 
background 
the 
task 
of 
"presenting 
to 
the 
government 
concrete 
demands 
for 
legislative 
and 
administrative 
measures" 
that 
"promise 
certain 
palpable 
results" 
(or 
demands 
for 
social 
reforms, 
that 
is, 
if 
we 
are 
permitted 
just 
once 
again 
to 
employ 
the 
old 
terminology 
of 
old 
humanity, 
which 
has 
not 
yet 
grown 
to 
Martynov's 
level). 
We 
suggest 
that 
the 



reader 
compare 
this 
thesis 
with 
the 
following 
tirade: 


"What 
also 
astonishes 
us 
in 
these 
programs" 
(the 
programs 
advanced 
by 
revolutionary 
Social-Democrats) 
"is 
the 
constant 
stress 
that 
is 
laid 
upon 
the 
benefits 
of 
workers' 
activity 
in 
parliament 
(non-existent 
in 
Russia), 
though 
they 
completely 
ignore 
(thanks 
to 
their 
revolutionary 
nihilism) 
the 
importance 
of 
workers 
participating 
in 
the 
legislative 
manufacturers' 
assemblies 
on 
factory 
affairs 
(which 
do 
exist 
in 
Russia) 
. 
. 
. 
or 
at 
least 
the 
importance 
of 
workers 
participating 
in 
municipal 
bodies. 
. 
. 
." 


The 
author 
of 
this 
tirade 
expresses 
somewhat 
more 
straight-forwardly, 
more 
clearly 
and 
frankly, 
the 
very 
idea 
which 
Lomonosov-Martynov 
discovered 
all 
by 
himself.

C. 
POLITICAL 
EXPOSURES 
AND 
"TRAINING 
IN 
REVOLUTIONARY 
ACTIVITY" 
In 
advancing 
against 
the 
Iskra 
his 
"theory" 
of 
"raising 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers," 
Martynov, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
betrayed 
a 
striving 
to 
belittle 
this 
activity, 
because 
he 
declared 
the 
very 
economic 
struggle, 
before 
which 
all 
Economists 
have 
grovelled, 
to 
be 
the 
preferable, 
the 
most 
important 
and 
"the 
most 
widely 
applicable" 
means 
of 
rousing 
this 
activity, 
and 
the 
widest 
field 
for 
it. 
This 
error 
is 
characteristic, 
precisely 
because 
it 
is 
by 
no 
means 
peculiar 
to 
Martynov 
alone. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
"raise 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers" 
only 
provided 
this 
activity 
is 
not 
restricted 
to 
"political 
agitation 
on 
an 
economic 
basis." 
And 
one 
of 
the 
fundamental 
conditions 
for 
the 
necessary 
expansion 
of 
political 
agitation 
is 
the 
organization 
of 
comprehensive 
political 
exposure. 
The 
masses 
cannot 
be 
trained 
in 
political 
consciousness 
and 
revolutionary 
activity 
in 
any 
other 
way 
except 
by 
means 
of 
such 
exposures. 
Hence, 
activity 
of 
this 
kind 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
functions 
of 
international 
Social-Democracy 
as 
a 
whole, 
for 
even 
the 
existence 
of 
political 
liberty 
does 
not 
in 
the 
least 
remove 
the 
necessity 
for 
such 
exposures; 
it 
merely 
changes 
somewhat 
the 
sphere 
against 
which 
they 
are 
directed. 
For 
example, 
the 
German 
party 
is 
especially 
strengthening 
its 
position 
and 
spreading 
its 
influence, 
thanks 
precisely 
to 
the 
untiring 
energy 
with 
which 
it 
is 
conducting 
a 
campaign 
of 
political 
exposure. 


Working-class 
consciousness 
cannot 
be 
genuinely 
political 
consciousness 
unless 
the 
workers 
are 
trained 
to 
respond 
to 
all 
cases, 
without 
exception, 
of 
tyranny, 
oppression, 
violence 
and 
abuse, 
no 
matter 
what 
class 
is 
affected. 
Moreover, 
to 
respond 
from 
a 
Social-Democratic, 
and 
not 
from 
any 
other 
point 
of 
view. 
The 
consciousness 
of 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers 
cannot 
be 
genuine 
class 
consciousness, 
unless 
the 
workers 
learn 
to 
observe 
from 
concrete, 
and 
above 
all 
from 
topical 
(current), 
political 
facts 
and 
events, 
every 
other 
social 
class 
and 
all 
the 
manifestations 
of 
the 
intellectual, 
ethical 
and 
political 
life 
of 
these 
classes; 
unless 
they 
learn 
to 
apply 
in 
practice 
the 
materialist 
analysis 
and 
the 
materialist 
estimate 
of 
all 
aspects 
of 
the 
life 
and 
activity 
of 
all 
classes, 
strata 
and 
groups 
of 
the 
population. 
Those 
who 
concentrate 
the 
attention, 
observation 
and 
consciousness 
of 
the 
working 
class 
exclusively, 
or 
even 
mainly, 
upon 
itself 
alone 
are 
not 
Social-Democrats; 
for 
its 
self-realization 
is 
indissolubly 
bound 
up 
not 
only 
with 
a 
fully 
clear 
theoretical 
--it 
would 
be 
even 
more 
true 
to 
say 
not 
so 
much 
with 
a 



theoretical, 
as 
with 
a 
practical 
understanding, 
of 
the 
relationships 
between 
all 
the 
various 
classes 
of 
modern 
society, 
acquired 
through 
experience 
of 
political 
life. 
That 
is 
why 
the 
idea 
preached 
by 
our 
Economists, 
that 
the 
economic 
struggle 
is 
the 
most 
widely 
applicable 
means 
of 
drawing 
the 
masses 
into 
the 
political 
movement, 
is 
so 
extremely 
harmful 
and 
extremely 
reactionary 
in 
its 
practical 
significance. 
In 
order 
to 
become 
a 
Social-Democrat, 
the 
worker 
must 
have 
a 
clear 
picture 
in 
his 
mind 
of 
the 
economic 
nature 
and 
the 
social 
and 
political 
features 
of 
the 
landlord 
and 
the 
priest, 
the 
high 
state 
official 
and 
the 
peasant, 
the 
student 
and 
the 
tramp; 
he 
must 
know 
their 
strong 
and 
weak 
points; 
he 
must 
see 
the 
meaning 
of 
all 
the 
catchwords 
and 
sophisms 
by 
which 
each 
class 
and 
each 
stratum 


camouflages 
its 
selfish 
strivings 
and 
its 
real 
"inside 
workings"; 
he 
must 
understand 
what 
interests 
certain 
institutions 
and 
certain 
laws 
reflect 
and 
how 
they 
reflect 
them. 
But 
this 
"clear 
picture" 
cannot 
be 
obtained 
from 
books. 
It 
can 
be 
obtained 
only 
from 
living 
examples 
and 
from 
exposures, 
following 
hot 
upon 
the 
heels 
of 
what 
is 
going 
on 
around 
us 
at 
a 
given 
moment, 
of 
what 
is 
being 
discussed, 
in 
whispers 
perhaps, 
by 
each 
one 
in 
his 
own 
way, 
of 
the 
meaning 
of 
such 
and 
such 
events, 
of 
such 
and 
such 
statistics, 
of 
such 
and 
such 
court 
sentences, 
etc., 
etc., 
etc. 
These 
comprehensive 
political 
exposures 
are 
an 
essential 
and 
fundamental 
condition 
for 
training 
the 
masses 
in 
revolutionary 
activity. 


Why 
is 
it 
that 
the 
Russian 
workers 
as 
yet 
display 
little 
revolutionary 
activity 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
brutal 
way 
in 
which 
the 
police 
maltreat 
the 
people, 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
persecution 
of 
the 
religious 
sects, 
with 
the 
flogging 
of 
the 
peasantry, 
with 
the 
outrageous 
censorship, 
the 
torture 
of 
soldiers, 
the 
persecution 
of 
the 
most 
innocent 
cultural 
undertakings, 
etc.? 
Is 
it 
because 
the 
"economic 
struggle" 
does 
not 
"stimulate" 
them 
to 
this, 
because 
such 
activity 
does 
not 
"promise 
palpable 
results," 
because 
it 
produces 
little 
that 
is 
"positive"? 
No. 
To 
advocate 
such 
views, 
we 
repeat, 
is 
merely 
to 
lay 
the 
blame 
where 
it 
does 
not 
belong, 
to 
blame 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers 
for 
one's 
own 
philistinism 
(which 
is 
also 
Bernsteinism). 
We 
must 
blame 
ourselves, 
our 
lagging 
behind 
the 
mass 
movement 
for 
being 
unable 
as 
yet 
to 
organize 
sufficiently 
wide, 
striking 
and 
rapid 
exposures 
of 
all 
these 
despicable 
outrages. 
When 
we 
do 
that 
(and 
we 
must 
and 
can 
do 
it), 
the 
most 
backward 
worker 
will 
understand, 
or 
will 
feel 
that 
the 
students 
and 
members 
of 
religious 
sects, 
the 
muzhiks 
and 
the 
authors 
are 
being 
abused 
and 
outraged 
by 
the 
very 
same 
dark 
forces 
that 
are 
oppressing 
and 
crushing 
him 
at 
every 



step 
of 
his 
life, 
and, 
feeling 
that, 
he 
himself 
will 
be 
filled 
with 
an 
irresistible 
desire 
to 
respond 
to 
these 
things, 
and 
then 
he 
will 
organize 
catcalls 
against 
the 
censors 
one 
day, 
another 
day 
he 
will 
demonstrate 
outside 
the 
house 
of 
a 
governor 
who 
has 
brutally 
suppressed 
a 
peasant 
uprising, 
another 
day 
he 
will 
teach 
a 
lesson 
to 
the 
gendarmes 
in 
surplices 
who 
are 
doing 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Holy 
Inquisition, 
etc. 
As 
yet 
we 
have 
done 
very 
little, 
almost 
nothing, 
to 
hurl 
universal 
and 
fresh 
exposures 
among 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers. 
Many 
of 
us 
as 
yet 
do 
not 
appreciate 
the 
bounden 
duty 
that 
rests 
upon 
us, 
but 
spontaneously 
trail 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
the 
"drab 
everyday 
struggle," 
in 
the 
narrow 
confines 
of 
factory 
life. 
Under 
such 
circumstances 
to 
say 
that 
the 
"Iskra 
displays 
a 
tendency 
to 
minimize 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
forward 
march 
of 
the 
drab 
everyday 
struggle 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
propaganda 
of 
brilliant 
and 
complete 
ideas" 
(Martynov, 
p. 
61) 
--means 
dragging 
the 
Party 
backward, 
defending 
and 
glorifying 
our 
unpreparedness 
and 
backwardness. 


As 
for 
calling 
the 
masses 
to 
action, 
that 
will 
come 
of 
itself 
immediately 
energetic 
political 
agitation, 
live 
and 
striking 
exposures 
are 
set 
going. 
To 
catch 
some 
criminal 
red-handed 
and 
immediately 
to 
brand 
him 
publicly 
is 
of 
itself 
far 
more 
effective 
than 
any 
number 
of 
"calls"; 
the 
effect 
very 
often 
is 
such 
as 
will 
make 
it 
impossible 
to 
tell 
exactly 
who 
it 
was 
that 
"called" 
on 
the 
crowd, 
and 
exactly 
who 
suggested 
this 
or 
that 
plan 
of 
demonstration, 
etc. 
Calls 
for 
action, 
not 
in 
the 
general, 
but 
in 
the 
concrete 
sense 
of 
the 
term, 
can 
be 
made 
only 
at 
the 
place 
of 
action; 
only 
those 
who 
themselves 
go 
into 
action, 
and 
do 
so 
immediately, 
can 
sound 
such 
calls. 
And 
our 
business 
as 
Social-Democratic 
publicists 
is 
to 
deepen, 
to 
expand 
and 
intensify 
political 
exposures 
and 
political 
agitation. 


A 
word 
in 
passing 
about 
"calls 
to 
action." 
The 
only 
paper 
which 
prior 
to 
the 
spring 
events[66] 
called 
upon 
the 
workers 
actively 
to 
intervene 
in 
a 
matter 
that 
certainly 
did 
not 
promise 
any 
palpable 
results 
whatever 
for 
the 
workers, 
i.e., 
the 
drafting 
of 
the 
students 
into 
the 
army, 
was 
the 
"Iskra." 
Immediately 
after 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
order 
of 
January 
11, 
on 
"drafting 
the 
183 
students 
into 
the 
army," 
the 
Iskra 
published 
an 
article 
about 
it 
(in 
its 
February 
issue, 
No. 
2),[67] 
and 
before 
any 
demonstration 
was 
started 
openly 
called 
upon 
"the 
workers 
to 
go 
to 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
students," 
called 
upon 
the 
"people" 
openly 
to 
take 
up 
the 
government's 
arrogant 
challenge. 
We 
ask: 
how 
is 
the 
remarkable 
fact 
to 
be 
explained 
that 
although 
Martynov 
talks 
so 
much 
about 
"calls 
to 
action," 
and 
even 
suggests 
"calls 
to 
action" 
as 
a 
special 
form 
of 
activity, 
he 
said 
not 
a 
word 
about 
this 
call? 
After 
this, 
is 
not 



Martynov's 
allegation, 
that 
the 
Iskra 
was 
one-sided 
because 
it 
did 
not 
sufficiently 
"call 
for" 
a 
struggle 
for 
demands 
"promising 
palpable 
results," 
sheer 
philistinism? 


Our 
Economists, 
including 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
were 
successful 
because 
they 
pandered 
to 
the 
backward 
workers. 
But 
the 
Social-Democratic 
worker, 
the 
revolutionary 
worker 
(and 
the 
number 
of 
such 
workers 
is 
growing) 
will 
indignantly 
reject 
all 
this 
talk 
about 
fighting 
for 
demands 
"promising 
palpable 
results," 
etc., 
because 
he 
will 
understand 
that 
this 
is 
only 
a 
variation 
of 
the 
old 
song 
about 
adding 
a 
kopek 
to 
the 
ruble. 
Such 
a 
worker 
will 
say 
to 
his 
counsellors 
of 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
and 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo: 
you 
are 
wasting 
your 
time, 
gentlemen, 
and 
shirking 
your 
proper 
duties, 
by 
meddling 
with 
such 
excessive 
zeal 
in 
a 
job 
that 
we 
can 
very 
well 
manage 
ourselves. 
There 
is 
nothing 
clever 
in 
your 
assertion 
that 
the 
Social-
Democrats' 
task 
is 
to 
lend 
the 
economic 
struggle 
itself 
a 
political 
character; 
that 
is 
only 
the 
beginning, 
it 


is 
not 
the 
main 
task 
of 
Social-Democrats. 
For 
all 
over 
the 
world, 
including 
Russia, 
the 
police 
themselves 
often 
make 
the 
start 
in 
lending 
the 
economic 
struggle 
a 
political 
character, 
and 
the 
workers 
themselves 
learn 
to 
understand 
whom 
the 
government 
supports.[*] 
The 
"economic 
struggle 
of 
the 
workers 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government," 
about 
which 
you 
make 
as 
much 
fuss 
as 
if 
you 
had 
discovered 
a 
new 
America, 
is 
being 
waged 
in 
a 
host 
of 
remote 
spots 
of 
Russia 
by 
the 
workers 
themselves 
who 
have 
heard 
about 
strikes, 
but 
who 
have 
heard 
almost 
nothing 
about 
Socialism. 
The 
"activity" 
you 
want 
to 
stimulate 
among 
us 
workers, 
by 
advancing 
concrete 
demands 
promising 
palpable 
results, 
we 
are 
already 
displaying 
and 
in 
our 
everyday, 
petty 
trade 
union 
work 
we 
put 
forward 
these 
concrete 
demands, 
very 
often 
without 
any 
assistance 
whatever 
from 
the 
intellectuals. 
But 
such 
activity 
is 
not 
enough 
for 
us; 
we 
are 
not 
children 
to 
be 
fed 
on 
the 


* 
The 
demand 
"to 
lend 
the 
economic 
struggle 
itself 
a 
political 
character" 
most 
strikingly 
expresses 
subservience 
to 
spontaneity 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
political 
activity. 
Very 
often 
the 
economic 
struggle 
spontaneously 
assumes 
a 
political 
character, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
without 
the 
intervention 
of 
the 
"revolutionary 
bacilli 
--the 
intelligentsia," 
without 
the 
intervention 
of 
the 
class-conscious 
Social-Democrats. 
For 
example, 
the 
economic 
struggle 
of 
the 
British 
workers 
also 
assumed 
a 
political 
character 
without 
any 
intervention 
of 
the 
Socialists. 
The 
tasks 
of 
the 
Social-Democrats 
however, 
are 
not 
exhausted 
by 
political 
agitation 
on 
an 
economic 
basis 
their 
task 
is 
to 
convert 
trade 
union 

politics 
into 
Social-Democratic 
politicai 
struggle, 
to 
utilize 
the 
sparks 
of 
political 
consciousness, 
which 
the 
economic 
struggle 
generates 
among 
the 
workers, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
raising 
them 
to 
the 
level 
of 
Social-
Democratic 
political 
consciousness. 
The 
Martynovs 
however, 
instead 
of 
raising 
and 
stimulating 
the 
spontaneously 
awakening 
political 
consciousness 
of 
the 
workers, 
bow 
to 
spontaneity 
and 
repeat 
over 
and 
over 
again 
ad 
nauseam, 
that 
the 
economic 
struggle 
"brings 
home" 
to 
the 
workers 
their 
own 
lack 
of 
political 
rights. 
It 
is 
unfortunate 
gentlemen, 
that 
the 
spontaneously 
awakening 
trade-unionist 
political 
consciousness 
does 
not 
"bring 
home" 
to 
you 
an 
understanding 
of 
your 
Social-Democratic 
tasks! 


thin 
gruel 
of 
"economic" 
politics 
alone; 
we 
want 
to 
know 
everything 
that 
others 
know, 
we 
want 
to 
learn 
the 
details 
of 
all 
aspects 
of 
political 
life 
and 
to 
take 
part 
actively 
in 
every 
single 
political 
event. 
In 
order 
that 
we 
may 
do 
this, 
the 
intellectuals 
must 
talk 
to 
us 
less 
of 
what 
we 
already 
know,[*] 
and 
tell 
us 
more 
about 
what 
we 
do 
not 
yet 
know 
and 
what 
we 
can 
never 
learn 
from 
our 
factory 
and 
"economic" 
experience, 
that 
is, 
you 
must 
give 
us 
political 
knowledge. 
You 
intellectuals 
can 
acquire 
this 
knowledge, 
and 
it 
is 
your 
duty 
to 
bring 
it 
to 
us 
in 
a 
hundred 
and 
a 
thousand 
times 
greater 


* 
To 
prove 
that 
this 
imaginary 
speech 
of 
a 
worker 
to 
an 
Economist 
is 
based 
on 
fact, 
we 
shall 
refer 
to 
two 
witnesses 
who 
undoubtedly 
have 
direct 
knowledge 
of 
the 
working-class 
movement, 
and 
who 
are 
least 
of 
all 
inclined 
to 
be 
partial 
towards 
us 
"doctrinaires," 
for 
one 
witness 
is 
an 
Economist 
(who 
regards 
even 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
as 
a 
political 
organ!), 
and 
the 
other 
is 
a 
terrorist. 
The 
first 
witness 
is 
the 
author 
of 
a 
remarkably 
truthful 
and 
vivid 
article 
entitled 
"The 
St. 
Petersburg 
Working 
Class 
Movement 
and 
the 
Practical 
Tasks 
of 
Social-Democracy," 
published 
in 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No. 
6. 
He 
divided 
the 
workers 
into 
the 
following 
categories: 
1. 
class-
conscious 
revolutionaries; 
2. 
intermediate 
stratum; 
3. 
all 
the 
rest. 
Now 
the 
intermediate 
stratum, 
he 
says, 
"is 
often 
more 
interested 
in 
questions 
of 
political 
life 
than 
in 
its 
own 
immediate 
economic 
interests, 
the 
connection

which 
and 
the 
general 
social 
conditions 
it 
has 
long 
understood. 
. 
. 
." 
The 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
"is 
sharply 
criticized": 
"it 
keeps 
on 
repeating 
the 
same 
thing 
over 
and 
over 
again, 
things 
we 
have 
long 
known, 
read 
long 
ago." 
"Nothing 
in 
the 
political 
review 
again!" 
(Pp. 
30-31.) 
But 
even 
the 
third 
stratum, 
"the 
younger 
and 
more 
sensitive 
section 
of 
the 
workers, 
less 
corrupted 
by 
the 
tavern 
and 
the 
church, 
who 
hardly 
ever 
have 
the 
opportunity 
of 
getting 
hold 
of

literature,

rambling 

way

over 
the

news 
they 
get 
about

riots," 
etc. 
The 
terrorist 
writes 
as 
follows: 
". 
. 
. 
They 
read 
over 
once 
or 
twice 
the 
petty 
details 
of 
factory 
life 
in

towns, 
not 
their 
own, 
and 
then 
they 
read 
no 
more

. 
. 
dull, 
they 
find 
it.

. 
. 
To 
say 
nothing 
in 
a 
workers' 
paper 
about 
the 
government

. 
is 
to 
regard 
the 
worker 
as 
a 
small 
child.

The 
workers 
are 
not 
babies."

Group,

measure 
than 
you 
have 
done 
up 
to 
now; 
and 
you 
must 
bring 
it 
to 
us, 
not 
only 
in 
the 
form 
of 
arguments, 
pamphlets 
and 
articles 
which 
sometimes 
-excuse 
our 
frankness! 
--are 
rather 
dull, 
but 
precisely 
in 
the 
form 
of 
live 
exposures 
of 
what 
our 
government 
and 
our 
governing 
classes 
are 
doing 
at 
this 
very 
moment 
in 
all 
spheres 
of 
life. 
Just 
devote 
more 
zeal 
to 
carrying 
out 
this 
duty, 
and 
talk 
less 
about 
"raising 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers"! 
We 
are 
far 
more 
active 
than 
you 
think, 
and 
we 
are 
quite 
able 
to 
support, 
by 
open, 
street 
fighting, 
demands 
that 
do 
not 
promise 
any 
"palpable 
results" 
whatever! 
And 
it 
is 
not 
for 
you 
to 
"raise" 
our 
activity, 
because 
activity 
is 
precisely 
the 
thing 
you 
yourselves 
lack! 
Bow 
less 
in 
worship 
to 
spontaneity, 
and 
think 
more 
about 
raising 
your 
own 
activity, 
gentlemen! 



D. 
WHAT 
IS 
THERE 
IN 
COMMON 
BETWEEN 
ECONOMISM 
AND 
TERRORISM? 
In 
the 
last 
footnote 
we 
quoted 
the 
opinion 
of 
an 
Economist 
and 
of 
a 
non-Social-Democratic 
terrorist 
who 
happened 
to 
be 
in 
agreement 
with 
him. 
Speaking 
generally, 
however, 
there 
is 
not 
an 
accidental, 
but 
a 
necessary, 
inherent 
connection 
between 
the 
two, 
about 
which 
we 
shall 
have 
to 
speak 
further 
on, 
but 
which 
must 
be 
dealt 
with 
here 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
question 
of 
training 
the 
masses 
in 
revolutionary 
activity. 
The 
Economists 
and 
the 
present-day 
terrorists 
have 
one 
common 
root, 
namely, 
the 
worship 
of 
spontaneity, 
which 
we 
dealt 
with 
in 
the 
preceding 
chapter 
as 
a 
general 
phenomenon, 
and 
which 
we 
shall 
now 
examine 
in 
relation 
to 
its 
effect 
upon 
political 
activity 
and 
the 
political 
struggle. 
At 
first 
sight, 
our 
assertion 
may 
appear 
paradoxical, 
so 
great 
is 


the 
difference 
between 
those 
who 
stress 
the 
"drab 
everyday 
struggle" 
and 
those 
who 
call 
for 
the 
most 
self-sacrificing 
struggle 
of 
individuals. 
But 
this 
is 
no 
paradox. 
The 
Economists 
and 
terrorists 
merely 
bow 
to 
different 
poles 
of 
spontaneity: 
the 
Economists 
bow 
to 
the 
spontaneity 
of 
the 
"pure" 
working-
class 
movement, 
while 
the 
terrorists 
bow 
to 
the 
spontaneity 
of 
the 
passionate 
indignation 
of 
intellectuals, 
who 
lack 
the 
ability 
or 
opportunity 
to 
link 
up 
the 
revolutionary 
struggle 
with 
the 
working-class 
movement, 
to 
form 
an 
integral 
whole. 
It 
is 
difficult 
indeed 
for 
those 
who 
have 
lost 
their 
belief, 
or 
who 
have 
never 
believed 
that 
this 
is 
possible, 
to 
find 
some 
outlet 
for 
their 
indignation 
and 
revolutionary 
energy 
other 
than 
terror. 
Thus, 
both 
kinds 
of 
worship 
of 
spontaneity 
we 
have 
mentioned 
are 
nothing 
more 
nor 
less 
than 
a 
beginning 
in 
carrying 
out 
the 
notorious 
Credo 
program: 
Let 
the 
workers 
wage 
their 
"economic 
struggle 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government" 
(we 
apologize 
to 
the 
author 
of 
the 
Credo 
for 
expressing 
his 
views 
in 
Martynov's 
words! 
We 
think 
we 
have 
a 
right 
to 
do 
so 
because 
the 
Credo, 
too, 
says 
that 
in 
the 
economic 
struggle 
the 
workers 
"come 
up 
against 
the 
political 
regime"), 
and 
let 
the 
intellectuals 
conduct 
the 
political 
struggle 
by 
their 
own 
efforts 
-with 
the 
aid 
of 
terror, 
of 
course! 
This 
is 
an 
absolutely 
logical 
and 
inevitable 
conclusion 
which 
must 
be 
insisted 
upon 
--even 
though 
those 
who 
are 
beginning 
to 
carry 
out 
this 
program 
do 
not 
themselves 
realize 
that 
it 
is 
inevitable. 
Political 
activity 
has 
its 
logic 
quite 
apart 
from 
the 
consciousness 
of 
those 
who, 
with 
the 
best 
intentions, 
call 
either 
for 
terror 
or 
for 
lending 
the 
economic 
struggle 
itself 
a 
political 
character. 
The 
road 
to 
hell 
is 
paved 
with 



good 
intentions, 
and, 
in 
this 
case, 
good 
intentions 
cannot 
save 
one 
from 
being 
spontaneously 
drawn 
"along 
the 
line 
of 
least 
resistance," 
along 
the 


line 
of 
the 
purely 
bourgeois 
Credo 
program. 
Surely 
it 
is 
no 
accident 
either 
that 
many 
Russian 
liberals 
--avowed 
liberals 
and 
those 
who 
wear 
the 
mask 
of 
Marxism 
--wholeheartedly 
sympathize 
with 
terror 
and 
are 
trying 
to 
keep 
alive 
the 
present 
wave 
of 
terrorist 
sentiments. 


And 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
Revolutionary-Socialist 
Svoboda 
Group 
-which 
set 
itself 
the 
aim 
of 
helping 
the 
working-class 
movement 
in 
every 
possible 
way, 
but 
which 
included 
in 
its 
program 
terror, 
and 
emancipation, 
so 
to 
speak, 
from 
Social-Democracy 
--this 
fact 
once 
again 
confirmed 
the 
remarkable 
penetration 
of 
P. 
B. 
Axelrod 
who 
literally 
foretold 
these 
results 
of 
Social-Democratic 
wavering 
as 
far 
back 
as 
the 
end 
of 
1897 
(The 
Contemporary 
Tasks 
and 
Tactics), 
when 
he 
outlined 
his 
remarkable 
"two 
perspectives." 
All 
the 
subsequent 
disputes 
and 
disagreements 
among 
Russian 
Social 
Democrats 
are 
contained, 
like 
a 
plant 
in 
the 
seed, 
in 
these 
two 
perspectives.* 


From 
this 
point 
of 
view 
it 
also 
becomes 
clear 
why 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
being 
unable 
to 
withstand 
the 
spontaneity 


* 
Martynov 
"conceives 
of 
another, 
more 
realistic(?) 
dilemma" 
(Social-
Democracy 
and 
the 
Working 
Class, 
p. 
19): 
"Either 
Social-Democracy 
takes 
over 
the 
direct 
leadership 
of 
the 
economic 
struggle 
of 
the 
proletariat 
and 
by 
that 
(! 
) 
transforms 
it 
into 
a 
revolutionary 
class 
struggle. 
. 
." 
"by 
that," 
i.e., 
apparently 
by 
the 
direct 
leadership 
of 
the 
economic 
struggle. 
Can 
Martynov 
quote 
an 
example 
where 
the 
leadership 
of 
the 
industrial 
struggle 
alone 
has 
succeeded 
in 
transforming 
a 
trade 
union 
movement 
into 
a 
revolutionary 
class 
movement? 
Cannot 
he 
understand 
that 
in 
order 
to 
bring 
about 
this 
"transformation" 
we 
must 
actively 
take 
up 
the 
"direct 
leadership" 
of 
all-
sided 
political 
agitation? 
. 
. 
. 
"Or 
the 
other 
prospect: 
Social-Democracy 
refrains 
from 
taking 
the 
leadership 
of 
the 
economic 
struggle 
of 
the 
workers 
and 
so 
. 
. 
. 
clips 
its 
own 
wings. 
. 
. 
." 
In 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo's 
opinion, 
quoted 
above, 
it 
is 
the 
Iskra 
that 
"refrains." 
We 
have 
seen, 
however, 
that 
the 
latter 
does 
far 
more 
to 
lead 
the 
economic 
struggle 
than 
the 
" 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo," 
but 
it 
does 
not 
confine 
itself 
to 
this, 
and 
does 
not 
narrow 
down 
its 
political 
tasks 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
it. 
of 
Economism, 
has 
been 
unable 
also 
to 
withstand 
the 
spontaneity 
of 
terrorism. 
It 
is 
highly 
interesting 
to 
note 
here 
the 
specific 
arguments 
that 
the 
Svoboda 
advanced 
in 
defence 
of 
terrorism. 
It 
"completely 
denies" 
the 



deterrent 
role 
of 
terrorism 
(The 
Regeneration 
of 
Revolutionism, 
p. 
64), 
but 
instead 
stresses 
its 
"excitative 
significance." 
This 
is 
characteristic, 
first, 
as 
representing 
one 
of 
the 
stages 
of 
the 
breakup 
and 
decline 
of 
the 
traditional 
(pre-Social-Democratic) 
cycle 
of 
ideas 
which 
insisted 
upon 
terrorism. 
To 
admit 
that 
the 
government 
cannot 
now 
be 
"terrified," 
and 
therefore 
disrupted, 
by 
terror, 
is 
tantamount 
to 
thoroughly 
condemning 
terror 
as 
a 
system 
of 
struggle, 
as 
a 
sphere 
of 
activity 
sanctioned 
by 
the 
program. 
Secondly, 
it 
is 
still 
more 
characteristic 
as 
an 
example 
of 
the 
failure 
to 
understand 
our 
immediate 
task 
of 
"training 
the 
masses 
in 
revolutionary 
activity." 
The 
Svoboda 
advocates 
terror 
as 
a 
means 
of 
"exciting" 
the 
working-class 
movement, 
and 
of 
giving 
it 
a 
"strong 
impetus." 
It 
is 
difficult 
to 
imagine 
an 
argument 
that 
disproves 
itself 
more 
than 
this 
one 
does! 
Are 
there 
not 
enough 
outrages 
committed 
in 
Russian 
life 
that 
special 
"excitants" 
have 
to 
be 
invented? 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
is 
it 
not 
obvious 
that 
those 
who 
are 
not, 
and 
cannot 
be, 
roused 
to 
excitement 
even 
by 
Russian 
tyranny 
will 
stand 
by 
"twiddling 
their 
thumbs," 
watching 
a 
handful 
of 
terrorists 
engaged 
in 
single 
combat 
with 
the 
government? 
The 
fact 
of 
the 
matter 
is 
that 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers 
are 
roused 
to 
a 
high 
pitch 
of 
excitement 
by 
the 
abominations 
in 
Russian 
life, 
but 
we 
are 
unable 
to 
collect, 
if 
one 
may 
put 
it 
that 
way, 
and 
concentrate 
all 
these 
drops 
and 
streamlets 
of 
popular 
excitement, 
which 
are 
called 
forth 
by 
the 
conditions 
of 
Russian 
life 
to 
a 
far 
larger 
extent 
than 
we 
imagine, 
but 
which 
it 
is 
precisely 
necessary 
to 
combine 
into 
a 
single 
gigantic 
torrent. 
That 
this 
can 
be 
accomplished 
is 


irrefutably 
proved 
by 
the 
enormous 
growth 
of 
the 
working-class 
movement 
and 
the 
eagerness 
with 
which 
the 
workers 
clamour 
for 
political 
literature, 
to 
which 
we 
have 
already 
referred 
above. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
calls 
for 
terror 
and 
calls 
to 
lend 
the 
economic 
struggle 
itself 
a 
political 
character 
are 
merely 
two 
different 
forms 
of 
evading 
the 
most 
pressing 
duty 
that 
now 
rests 
upon 
Russian 
revolutionaries, 
namely, 
to 
organize 
comprehensive 
political 
agitation. 
The 
Svoboda 
desires 
to 
substitute 
terror 
for 
agitation, 
openly 
admitting 
that 
"as 
soon 
as 
intensified 
and 
strenuous 
agitation 
is 
commenced 
among 
the 
masses 
the 
excitative 
function 
of 
terror 
will 
be 
finished." 
(The 
Regeneration 
of 
Revolutionism, 
p. 
68.) 
This 
is 
exactly 
what 
proves 
that 
both 
the 
terrorists 
and 
the 
Economists 
underestimate 
the 
revolutionary 
activity 
of 
the 
masses, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
striking 
evidence 
of 
the 
events 
that 
took 
place 
in 
the 
spring,[*] 
and 
whereas 
the 
former 
go 
out 
in 
search 
of 
artificial 
"excitants," 
the 
latter 
talk 
about 
"concrete 
demands." 
But 



both 
fail 
to 
devote 
sufficient 
attention 
to 
the 
development 
of 
their 
own 
activity 
in 
political 
agitation 
and 
in 
the 
organization 
of 
political 
exposures. 
And 
no 
other 
work 
can 
serve 
as 
a 
substitute 
for 
this 
work 
either 
at 
the 
present 
time 
or 
at 
any 
other 
time. 



E. 
THE 
WORKING 
CLASS 
AS 
VANGUARD 
FIGHTER 
FOR 
DEMOCRACY 
We 
have 
seen 
that 
the 
conduct 
of 
the 
broadest 
political 
agitation, 
and 
consequently 
the 
organization 
of 
comprehensive 
political 
exposures, 
is 
an 
absolutely 
necessary, 
and 
the 


* 
This 
refers 
to 
the 
big 
street 
demonstrations 
which 
commenced 
in 
the 
spring 
of 
1901. 
(Author's 
note 
to 
the1907 
edition. 
--Ed.) 
most 
urgently 
necessary, 
task 
of 
activity, 
that 
is, 
if 
that 
activity 
is 
to 
be 
truly 
Social-Democratic. 
However, 
we 
arrived 
at 
this 
conclusion 
solely 
on 
the 
grounds 
of 
the 
pressing 
needs 
of 
the 
working 
class 
for 
political 
knowledge 
and 
political 
training. 
But 
presenting 
the 
question 
in 
this 
way 
alone 
is 
too 
narrow, 
for 
it 
ignores 
the 
general 
democratic 
tasks 
of 
Social-Democracy 
in 
general, 
and 
of 
present-day 
Russian 
Social-Democracy 
in 
particular. 
In 
order 
to 
explain 
the 
point 
more 
concretely 
we 
shall 
approach 
the 
subject 
from 
an 
aspect 
that 
is 
"nearest" 
to 
the 
Economist, 
namely, 
from 
the 
practical 
aspect. 
"Everyone 
agrees" 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
develop 
the 
political 
consciousness 
of 
the 
working 
class. 
The 
question 
is, 
how 
is 
that 
to 
be 
done, 
what 
is 
required 
to 
do 
it? 
The 
economic 
struggle 
merely 
"brings 
home" 
to 
the 
workers 
questions 
concerning 
the 
attitude 
of 
the 
government 
towards 
the 
working 
class. 
Consequently, 
however 
much 
we 
may 
try 
to 
"lend 
the 
economic 
struggle 
itself 
a 
political 
character" 
we 
shall 
never 
be 
able 
to 
develop 
the 
political 
consciousness 
of 
the 
workers 
(to 
the 
level 
of 
Social-Democratic 
political 
consciousness) 
by 
keeping 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
economic 
struggle, 
for 
that 
framework 
is 
too 
narrow. 
The 
Martynov 
formula 
has 
some 
value 
for 
us, 
and 
not 
because 
it 
illustrates 
Martynov's 
ability 
to 
confuse 
things, 
but 
because 
it 
strikingly 
expresses 
the 
fundamental 
error 
that 
all 
the 
Economists 
commit, 
namely, 
their 
conviction 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
develop 
the 
class 
political 
consciousness 
of 
the 
workers 
from 
within, 
so 
to 
speak, 
their 
economic 
struggle, 
i.e., 
making 
this 
struggle 
the 
exclusive 
(or, 
at 
least, 
the 
main) 
starting 
point, 
making 
it 
the 
exclusive, 
or, 
at 
least, 
the 
main 
basis. 
Such 
a 
view 
is 
fundamentally 
wrong. 
Just 
because 
the 
Economists 
are 
piqued 
by 
our 
polemics 
against 
them, 
they 
refuse 
to 
ponder 
deeply 
over 
the 
origins 
of 
these 
disagreements, 


with 
the 
result 
that 
we 
absolutely 
fail 
to 
understand 
each 
other. 
It 
is 
as 
if 
we 
spoke 
in 
different 
tongues. 
Class 
political 
consciousness 
can 
be 
brought 
to 
the 
workers 
only 
from 



without, 
that 
is, 
only 
from 
outside 
of 
the 
economic 
struggle, 
from 
outside 
of 
the 
sphere 
of 
relations 
between 
workers 
and 
employers. 
The 
sphere 
from 
which 
alone 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
obtain 
this 
knowledge 
is 
the 
sphere 
of 
relationships 
between 
all 
the 
classes 
and 
strata 
and 
the 
state 
and 
the 
government, 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
interrelations 
between 
all 
the 
classes. 
For 
that 
reason, 
the 
reply 
to 
the 
question 
as 
to 
what 
must 
be 
done 
to 
bring 
political 
knowledge 
to 
the 
workers 
cannot 
be 
merely 
the 
answer 
with 
which, 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
cases, 
the 
practical 
workers, 
especially 
those 
inclined 
towards 
Economism, 
mostly 
content 
themselves, 
namely: 
"To 
go 
among 
the 
workers." 
To 
bring 
political 
knowledge 
to 
the 
workers 
the 
Social-Democrats 
must 
go 
among 
all 
classes 
of 
the 
population, 
must 
dispatch 
units 
of 
their 
army 
in 
all 
directions. 


We 
deliberately 
select 
this 
awkward 
formula, 
we 
deliberately 
express 
ourselves 
in 
a 
simplified, 
blunt 
way 
--not 
because 
we 
desire 
to 
indulge 
in 
paradoxes, 
but 
in 
order 
to 
"bring 
home" 
to 
the 
Economists 
those 
tasks 
which 
they 
unpardonably 
ignore, 
to 
make 
them 
understand 
the 
difference 
between 
trade-unionist 
and 
Social-Democratic 
politics, 
which 
they 
refuse 
to 
understand. 
We 
therefore 
beg 
the 
reader 
not 
to 
get 
excited, 
but 
to 
listen 
patiently 
to 
the 
end. 


Take 
the 
type 
of 
Social-Democratic 
that 
has 
become 
most 
widespread 
in 
the 
past 
few 
years, 
and 
examine 
its 
work. 
It 
has 
"contacts 
with 
the 
workers," 
and 
rests 
content 
with 
this, 
issuing 
leaflets 
in 
which 
abuses 
in 
the 
factories, 
the 
government's 
partiality 
towards 
the 
capitalist 
and 
the 
tyranny 
of 
the 
police 
are 
strongly 
condemned. 
At 
meetings 
of 
work


ers 
the 
discussions 
never, 
or 
rarely, 
go 
beyond 
the 
limits 
of 
these 
subjects. 
Lectures 
and 
discussions 
on 
the 
history 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
movement, 
on 
questions 
of 
the 
home 
and 
foreign 
policy 
of 
our 
government, 
on 
questions 
of 
the 
economic 
evolution 
of 
Russia 
and 
of 
Europe, 
and 
the 
position 
of 
the 
various 
classes 
in 
modern 
society, 
etc., 
are 
extremely 
rare. 
As 
to 
systematically 
acquiring 
and 
extending 
contact 
with 
other 
classes 
of 
society, 
no 
one 
even 
dreams 
of 
that. 
In 
fact 
the 
ideal 
leader, 
as 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
members 
of 
such 
circles 
picture 
him, 
is 
something 
far 
more 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
trade 
union 
secretary 
than 
a 
socialist 
political 
leader. 
For 
the 
trade 
union 
secretary 
of 
any, 
say 
British 
trade 
union, 
always 
helps 
the 
workers 
to 
conduct 
the 
economic 
struggle, 
helps 
to 
expose 
factory 
abuses, 
explains 
the 
injustice 
of 
the 
laws 
and 
of 
measures 
which 
hamper 
the 
freedom 
to 
strike 
and 
the 
freedom 
to 
picket 
(i.e., 
to 
warn 
all 
and 
sundry 
that 
a 
strike 
is 
proceeding 
at 
a 



certain 
factory), 
explains 
the 
partiality 
of 
arbitration 
court 
judges 
who 
belong 
to 
the 
bourgeois 
classes, 
etc., 
etc. 
In 
a 
word, 
every 
trade 
union 
secretary 
conducts 
and 
helps 
to 
conduct 
"the 
economic 
struggle 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government." 
It 
cannot 
be 
too 
strongly 
insisted 
that 
this 
is 
not 
yet 
Social-Democracy. 
The 
Social-Democratic 
ideal 
should 
not 
be 
a 
trade 
union 
secretary, 
but 
a 
tribune 
of 
the 
people, 
able 
to 
react 
to 
every 
manifestation 
of 
tyranny 
and 
oppression, 
no 
matter 
where 
it 
takes 
place, 
no 
matter 
what 
stratum 
or 
class 
of 
the 
people 
it 
affects; 
he 
must 
be 
able 
to 
generalize 
all 
these 
manifestations 
to 
produce 
a 
single 
picture 
of 
police 
violence 
and 
capitalist 
exploitation; 
he 
must 
be 
able 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
every 
event, 
however 
small, 
in 
order 
to 
explain 
his 
Socialistic 
convictions 
and 
his 
democratic 
demands 
to 
all, 
in 
order 
to 
explain 
to 
all 
and 
everyone 
the 
world-historic 
significance 
of 
the 
proletariat's 


struggle 
for 
emancipation. 
Compare, 
for 
example, 
a 
leader 
like 
Robert 
Knight 
(the 
well-known 
secretary 
and 
leader 
of 
the 
Boiler-Makers' 
Society, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
powerful 
trade 
unions 
in 
England), 
with 
Wilhelm 
Liebknecht, 
and 
try 
to 
apply 
to 
them 
the 
contrasts 
that 
Martynov 
draws 
in 
his 
controversy 
with 
the 
Iskra. 
You 
will 
see 
--I 
am 
running 
through 
Martynov's 
article 
--that 
Robert 
Knight 
engaged 
more 
in 
"calling 
the 
masses 
to 
certain 
concrete 
actions" 
(p. 
39) 
while 
Wilhelm 
Liebknecht 
engaged 
more 
in 
"the 
revolutionary 
elucidation 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
present 
system 
or 
partial 
manifestations 
of 
it" 
(pp. 
38-39); 
that 
Robert 
Knight 
"formulated 
the 
immediate 
demands 
of 
the 
proletariat 
and 
indicated 
the 
means 
by 
which 
they 
can 
be 
achieved" 
(p. 
41), 
whereas 
Wilhelm 
Liebknecht, 
while 
doing 
this, 
was 
not 
averse 
"simultaneously 
to 
guide 
the 
activities 
of 
various 
opposition 
strata," 
"dictate 
a 
positive 
program 
of 
action 
for 
them"[*] 
(p. 
41); 
that 
it 
was 
precisely 
Robert 
Knight 
who 
strove 
"as 
far 
as 
possible 
to 
lend 
the 
economic 
struggle 
itself 
a 
political 
character" 
(p. 
42) 
and 
was 
excellently 
able 
"to 
submit 
to 
the 
government 
concrete 
demands 
promising 
certain 
palpable 
results" 
(p. 
43), 
while 
Liebknecht 
engaged 
to 
a 
much 
greater 
degree 
in 
"one-
sided" 
"exposures" 
(p. 
40); 
that 
Robert 
Knight 
attached 
more 
significance 
to 
the 
"forward 
march 
of 
the 
drab, 
everyday 
struggle" 
(p. 
61), 
while 
Liebknecht 
attached 
more 
significance 
to 
the 
"propaganda 
of 
brilliant 
and 
finished 
ideas" 


(p. 
6I); 
that 
Liebknecht 
converted 
the 
paper 
he 
was 
directing 
into 
"an 
organ 
of 
revolutionary 
opposition 
that 
exposes 
the 
state 
of 
affairs 
in 
our 
country, 
particularly 
the 
political 
state 
of 
affairs, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
affects 
the 
interests 
* 
For 
example, 
during 
the 
Franco-Prussian 
War, 
Liebknecht 
dictated 
a 

program 
of 
action 
for 
the 
whole 
of 
democracy 
--and 
this 
was 
done 
to 
an 
even 
greater 
extent 
by 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
in 
1848. 


of 
the 
most 
varied 
strata 
of 
the 
population" 
(p. 
63), 
whereas 
Robert 
Knight 
"worked 
for 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
working 
class 
in 
close 
organic 
contact 
with 
the 
proletarian 
struggle" 
(p. 
63) 
--if 
by 
"close 
and 
organic 
contact" 
is 
meant 
the 
worship 
of 
spontaneity 
which 
we 
examined 
above 
using 
the 
example 
of 
Krichevsky 
and 
Martynov 
--and 
"restricted 
the 
sphere 
of 
his 
influence," 
convinced, 
of 
course, 
as 
is 
Martynov, 
that 
"by 
doing 
so 
he 
intensified 
that 
influence" 
(p. 
63). 
In 
a 
word, 
you 
will 
see 
that 
de 
facto 
Martynov 
reduces 
Social-Democracy 
to 
the 
level 
of 
trade 
unionism, 
though 
he 
does 
so, 
of 
course, 
not 
because 
he 
does 
not 
desire 
the 
good 
of 
Social-Democracy, 
but 
simply 
because 
he 
is 
a 
little 
too 
much 
in 
a 
hurry 
to 
render 
Plekhanov 
more 
profound, 
instead 
of 
taking 
the 
trouble 
to 
understand 
him. 


Let 
us 
return, 
however, 
to 
our 
thesis. 
We 
said 
that 
a 
Social-Democrat, 
if 
he 
really 
believes 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
develop 
comprehensively 
the 
political 
consciousness 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
must 
"go 
amomg 
all 
classes 
of 
the 
population." 
This 
gives 
rise 
to 
the 
questions: 
How 
is 
this 
to 
be 
done? 
Have 
we 
enough 
forces 
to 
do 
this? 
Is 
there 
a 
basis 
for 
such 
work 
among 
all 
the 
other 
classes? 
Will 
this 
not 
mean 
a 
retreat, 
or 
lead 
to 
a 
retreat, 
from 
the 
class 
point 
of 
view? 
Let 
us 
deal 
with 
these 
questions. 


We 
must 
"go 
among 
all 
classes 
of 
the 
population" 
as 
theoreticians, 
as 
propagandists, 
as 
agitators 
and 
as 
organizers. 
No 
one 
doubts 
that 
the 
theoretical 
work 
of 
Social-Democrats 
should 
aim 
at 
studying 
all 
the 
features 
of 
the 
social 
and 
political 
position 
of 
the 
various 
classes. 
But 
extremely 
little, 
little 
beyond 
proportion, 
is 
done 
in 
this 
direction 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
work 
that 
is 
done 
in 
studying 
the 
features 
of 
factory 
life. 
In 
the 
committees 
and 
circles, 
you 
will 
meet 
people 
who 
are 
immersed 
even 
in 
the 
study 
of, 
say, 
some 
special 


branch 
of 
the 
metal 
industry, 
but 
you 
will 
hardly 
ever 
find 
members 
of 
organizations 
(obliged, 
as 
often 
happens, 
for 
some 
reason 
or 
other 
to 
give 
up 
practical 
work) 
especially 
engaged 
in 
the 
collection 
of 
material 
concerning 
some 
pressing 
question 
of 
social 
and 
political 
life 
in 
our 
country 
which 
could 
serve 
as 
a 
means 
for 
conducting 
Social-Democratic 
work 
among 
other 
strata 
of 
the 
population. 
In 
speaking 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
training 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
present-day 
leaders 
of 
the 
working-class 
movement, 
we 
cannot 
refrain 
from 
mentioning 
the 
point 
about 
training 
in 
this 
connection 
also, 
for 
it 
too 
is 
bound 



up 
with 
the 
"economic" 
conception 
of 
"close 
organic 
contact 
with 
the 
proletarian 
struggle." 
The 
principal 
thing, 
of 
course, 
is 
propaganda 
and 
agitation 
among 
all 
strata 
of 
the 
people. 
The 
work 
of 
the 
West-European 
Social 
Democrat 
is 
in 
this 
respect 
facilitated 
by 
the 
public 
meetings 
and 
rallies, 
to 
which 
all 
are 
free 
to 
go, 
and 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
parliament 
he 
addresses 
the 
representatives 
of 
all 
classes. 
We 
have 
neither 
a 
parliament 
nor 
freedom 
of 
assembly, 
nevertheless 
we 
are 
able 
to 
arrange 
meetings 
of 
workers 
who 
desire 
to 
listen 
to 
a 
Social-Democrat. 
We 
must 
also 
find 
ways 
and 
means 
of 
calling 
meetings 
of 
representatives 
of 
all 
classes 
of 
the 
population 
that 
desire 
to 
listen 
to 
a 
democrat; 
for 
he 
is 
no 
Social-
Democrat 
who 
forgets 
that 
"the 
Communists 
support 
every 
revolutionary 
movement," 
that 
we 
are 
obliged 
for 
that 
reason 
to 
expound 
and 
emphasize 
general 
democratic 
tasks 
before 
the 
whole 
people, 
without 
for 
a 
moment 
concealing 
our 
socialist 
convictions. 
He 
is 
no 
Social 
Democrat 
who 
forgets 
his 
obligation 
to 
be 
ahead 
of 
everybody 
in 
advancing, 
accentuating 
and 
solving 
every 
general 
democratic 
problem. 


"But 
everybody 
agrees 
with 
this!" 
--the 
impatient 
reader 
will 
exclaim 
-
and 
the 
new 
instructions 
adopted 
by 
the 
last 


Congress 
of 
the 
Union 
for 
the 
editorial 
board 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
definitely 
say: 
"All 
events 
of 
social 
and 
political 
life 
that 
affect 
the 
proletariat 
either 
directly 
as 
a 
special 
class 
or 
as 
the 
vanguard 
of 
all 
the 
revolutionary 
forces 
in 
the 
struggle 
for 
freedom 
should 
serve 
as 
subjects 
for 
political 
propaganda 
and 
agitation." 
(Two 
Congresses, 
p. 
17, 
our 
italics.) 
Yes, 
these 
are 
very 
true 
and 
very 
good 
words 
and 
we 
would 
be 
fully 
satisfied 
if 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
understood 
them 
and 
if 
it 
refrained 
from 
saying 
in 
the 
next 
breath 
things 
that 
are 
the 
very 
opposite 
of 
them. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
enough 
to 
call 
ourselves 
the 
"vanguard," 
the 
advanced 
detachment; 
we 
must 
act 
like 
one; 
we 
must 
act 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
all 
the 
other 
detachments 
shall 
see 
us, 
and 
be 
obliged 
to 
admit, 
that 
we 
are 
marching 
in 
the 
vanguard. 
And 
we 
ask 
the 
reader: 
Are 
the 
representatives 
of 
the 
other 
"detachments" 
such 
fools 
as 
to 
take 
our 
word 
for 
it 
when 
we 
say 
that 
we 
are 
the 
"vanguard"? 
Just 
picture 
to 
yourselves 
the 
following: 
A 
Social-Democrat 
comes 
to 
the 
"detachment" 
of 
Russian 
educated 
radicals, 
or 
liberal 
constitutionalists, 
and 
says: 
We 
are 
the 
vanguard; 
"the 
task 
confronting 
us 
now 
is, 
as 
far 
as 
possible, 
to 
lend 
the 
economic 
struggle 
itself 
a 
political 
character." 
The 
radical, 
or 
constitutionalist, 
if 
he 
is 
at 
all 
intelligent 
(and 
there 
are 
many 
intelligent 
men 
among 
Russian 
radicals 
and 
constitutionalists), 
would 
only 
laugh 
at 
such 
a 



speech, 
and 
would 
say 
(to 
himself, 
of 
course, 
for 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
cases 
he 
is 
an 
experienced 
diplomat): 
"Your 
'vanguard' 
must 
be 
made 
up 
of 
simpletons! 
They 
do 
not 
even 
understand 
that 
it 
is 
our 
task, 
the 
task 
of 
the 
progressive 
representatives 
of 
bourgeois 
democracy 
to 
lend 
the 
workers' 
economic 
struggle 
itself 
a 
political 
character. 
Why, 
we 
too, 
like 
all 
the 
West-European 
bourgeoisie, 
want 
to 
draw 
the 
workers 
into 
politics, 
but 
precisely 
into 
trade-
unionist, 


and 
not 
Social-Democratic 
politics. 
Trade-unionist 
politics 
of 
the 
working 
class 
are 
precisely 
bourgeois 
politics 
of 
the 
working 
class 
and 
the 
'vanguard's' 
formulation 
of 
its 
tasks 
is 
the 
formula 
for 
trade-unionist 
politics. 
Let 
them 
even 
call 
themselves 
Social-Democrats 
to 
their 
heart's 
content, 
I 
am 
not 
a 
child 
to 
get 
excited 
over 
a 
label. 
But 
they 
must 
not 
fall 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
those 
pernicious 
orthodox 
doctrinaires, 
let 
them 
allow 
'freedom 
of 
criticism' 
to 
those 
who 
are 
unconsciously 
driving 
Social-Democracy 
into 
trade 
unionist 
channels." 


And 
the 
light 
chuckle 
of 
our 
constitutionalst 
will 
turn 
into 
Homeric 
laughter 
when 
he 
learns 
that 
the 
Social-Democrats 
who 
talk 
about 
Social-
Democracy 
being 
the 
vanguard 
at 
the 
present 
time, 
when 
spontaneity 
almost 
completely 
dominates 
our 
movement, 
fear 
nothing 
so 
much 
as 
"belittling 
the 
spontaneous 
elements," 
as 
"belittling 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
forward 
march 
of 
the 
drab, 
everyday 
struggle, 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
propaganda 
of 
brilliant 
and 
finished 
ideas," 
etc., 
etc.! 
A 
"vanguard" 
which 
fears 
that 
consciousness 
will 
outstrip 
spontaneity, 
which 
fears 
to 
put 
forward 
a 
bold 
"plan" 
that 
would 
compel 
universal 
recognition 
even 
among 
those 
who 
think 
differently 
from 
us. 
Are 
you 
no 
confusing 
the 
word 
"vanguard" 
with 
the 
word 
"rearguard"? 


Ponder 
over 
following 
piece 
of 
Martynov 
reasoning. 
On 
page 
40 
he 
says 
that 
the 
Iskra's 
tactics 
of 
exposing 
abuses 
are 
one-sided, 
that 
"however 
much 
we 
may 
spread 
distrust 
and 
hatred 
towards 
the 
government, 
we 
shall 
not 
achieve 
our 
aim 
until 
we 
have 
succeeded 
in 
developing 
sufficiently 
active 
social 
energy 
for 
its 
overthrow." 
This, 
it 
may 
be 
said 
in 
parenthesis, 
is 
the 
concern, 
with 
which 
we 
are 
already 
familiar, 
for 
increasing 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
masses, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
striving 
to 
restrict 
one's 
own 
activity. 
But 


that 
is 
not 
the 
main 
point 
just 
now. 
Martynov, 
therefore, 
speaks 
here 
of 
revolutionary 
energy 
("for 
overthrowing"). 
And 
what 
conclusion 
does 
he 
arrive 
at? 
Since 
in 
ordinary 
times 
various 
social 
strata 
inevitably 
march 
separately, 
"it 
is, 
therefore, 
clear 
that 
we 
Social-Democrats 
cannot 
simultaneously 
guide 
the 
activities 
of 
various 
opposition 
strata, 
we 
cannot 



dictate 
to 
them 
a 
positive 
program 
of 
action, 
we 
cannot 
point 
out 
to 
them 
in 
what 
manner 
they 
should 
fight 
for 
their 
daily 
interests. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
liberal 
strata 
will 
themselves 
take 
care 
of 
the 
active 
struggle 
for 
their 
immediate 
interests 
and 
that 
struggle 
will 
bring 
them 
face 
to 
face 
with 
our 
political 
regime." 
(P. 
41.) 
Thus, 
having 
commenced 
with 
talk 
about 
revolutionary 
energy, 
about 
the 
active 
struggle 
for 
the 
overthrow 
of 
the 
autocracy, 
Martynov 
immediately 
turns 
towards 
trade 
union 
energy 
and 
active 
struggle 
for 
immediate 
interests! 
It 
goes 
without 
saying 
that 
we 
cannot 
guide 
the 
struggle 
of 
the 
students, 
liberals, 
etc., 
for 
their 
"immediate 
interests," 
but 
this 
was 
not 
the 
point 
at 
issue, 
most 
worthy 
Economist! 
The 
point 
we 
were 
discussing 
was 
the 
possible 
and 
necessary 
participation 
of 
various 
social 
strata 
in 
the 
overthrow 
of 
the 
autocracy; 
and 
not 
only 
are 
we 
able, 
but 
it 
is 
our 
bounden 
duty, 
to 
guide 
these 
"activities 
of 
the 
various 
opposition 
strata" 
if 
we 
desire 
to 
be 
the 
"vanguard." 
Not 
only 
will 
our 
students 
and 
liberals, 
etc., 
themselves 
take 
care 
of 
"the 
struggle 
that 
will 
bring 
them 
face 
to 
face 
with 
our 
political 
regime"; 
the 
police 
and 
the 
officials 
of 
the 
autocratic 
government 
will 
see 
to 
this 
more 
than 
anyone 
else. 
But 
if 
"we" 
desire 
to 
be 
advanced 
democrats, 
we 
must 
make 
it 
our 
business 
to 
stimulate 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
those 
who 
are 
dissatisfied 
with 
university, 
or 
only 
with 
Zemstvo, 
etc. 
conditions 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
whole 
political 
system 
is 
worthless. 
We 
must 
take 
upon 
ourselves 
the 
task 
of 
organizing 
an 
all-round 


political 
struggle 
under 
the 
leadership 
of 
our 
Party 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
as 
to 
obtain 
all 
the 
support 
possible 
of 
all 
opposition 
strata 
for 
the 
struggle 
and 
for 
our 
Party. 
We 
must 
train 
our 
Social-Democratic 
practical 
workers 
to 
become 
political 
leaders, 
able 
to 
guide 
all 
the 
manifestations 
of 
this 
all-round 
struggle, 
able 
at 
the 
right 
time 
to 
"dictate 
a 
positive 
program 
of 
action" 
for 
the 
restless 
students, 
the 
discontented 
Zemstvo 
Councillors, 
the 
incensed 
religious 
sects, 
the 
offended 
elementary 
schoolteachers, 
etc., 
etc. 
For 
that 
reason, 
Martynov's 
assertion 
is 
absolutely 
wrong 
--that 
"with 
regard 
to 
these, 
we 
can 
come 
forward 
merely 
in 
the 
negative 
role 
of 
exposers 
of 
abuses 
. 
. 
. 
we 
can 
only" 
(our 
italics) 
"dissipate 
the 
hopes 
they 
have 
in 
various 
government 
commissions." 
By 
saying 
this 
Martynov 
shows 
that 
he 
understands 
absolutely 
nothing 
about 
the 
role 
that 
the 
revolutionary 
"vanguard" 
must 
really 
play. 
If 
the 
reader 
bears 
this 
in 
mind, 
he 
will 
be 
clear 
as 
to 
the 
real 
meaning 
of 
Martynov's 
following 
concluding 
remarks: 
"The 
Iskra 
is 
an 
organ 
of 
revolutionary 
opposition 
that 
exposes 
the 
state 
of 
affairs 
in 
our 
country, 
particularly 
the 
political 
state 
of 
affairs 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 



affects 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
most 
varied 
strata 
of 
the 
population. 
We, 
however, 
work 
and 
shall 
continue 
to 
work 
for 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
working 
class 
in 
close 
organic 
contact 
with 
the 
proletarian 
struggle. 
By 
narrowing 
down 
the 
sphere 
of 
our 
active 
influence, 
we 
make 
it 
more 
complicated 
to 
exercise 
that 
influence." 
(P. 
63.) 
The 
true 
meaning 
of 
this 
conclusion 
is 
as 
follows: 
the 
Iskra 
desires 
to 
elevate 
the 
trade-unionist 
politics 
of 
the 
working 
class 
(to 
which, 
owing 
to 
misunderstanding, 
lack 
of 
training, 
or 
by 
conviction, 
our 
practical 
workers 
frequently 
confine 
themselves) 
to 
Social-Democratic 
politics, 
whereas 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
desires 
to 
degrade 
Social-Democratic 
politics 
to 
trade 
unionist 
politics. 
And, 
what 
is 
more, 
it 
assures 
the 
world 


that 
these 
positions 
are 
"quite 
compatible 
within 
the 
common 
cause" 
(p. 
63). 
O, 
Sancta 
simplicitas 
! 
[68] 


To 
proceed: 
Have 
we 
sufficient 
forces 
to 
direct 
our 
propaganda 
and 
agitation 
among 
all 
classes 
of 
the 
population? 
Of 
course 
we 
have. 
Our 
Economists, 
frequently 
inclined 
as 
they 
are 
to 
deny 
this, 
lose 
sight 
of 
the 
gigantic 
progress 
our 
movement 
has 
made 
from 
1894 
(approximately) 
to 
1901. 
Like 
real 
"tail-enders," 
they 
frequently 
live 
in 
the 
distant 
past, 
in 
the 
period 
when 
the 
movement 
was 
just 
beginning. 
At 
that 
time, 
indeed, 
we 
had 
astonishingly 
few 
forces, 
and 
it 
was 
perfectly 
natural 
and 
legitimate 
then 
to 
devote 
ourselves 
exclusively 
to 
activities 
among 
the 
workers, 
and 
severely 
condemn 
any 
deviation 
from 
this. 
The 
whole 
task 
then 
was 
to 
consolidate 
our 
position 
in 
the 
working 
class. 
At 
the 
present 
time, 
however, 
gigantic 
forces 
have 
been 
attracted 
to 
the 
movement; 
the 
best 
representatives 
of 
the 
young 
generation 
of 
the 
educated 
classes 
are 
coming 
over 
to 
us; 
all 
over 
the 
country 
there 
are 
people, 
compelled 
to 
live 
in 
the 
provinces, 
who 
have 
taken 
part 
in 
the 
movement 
in 
the 
past 
or 
who 
desire 
to 
do 
so 
now, 
who 
are 
gravitating 
towards 
Social-Democracy 
(whereas 
in 
1894 
you 
could 
count 
the 
Social-
Democrats 
on 
your 
fingers). 
One 
of 
the 
principal 
political 
and 
organizational 
shortcomings 
of 
our 
movement 
is 
that 
we 
do 
not 
know 
how 
to 
utilize 
all 
these 
forces 
and 
give 
them 
appropriate 
work 
(we 
shall 
deal 
with 
this 
in 
greater 
detail 
in 
the 
next 
chapter). 
The 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
these 
forces 
entirely 
lack 
the 
opportunity 
of 
"going 
among 
the 
workers," 
so 
there 
are 
no 
grounds 
for 
fearing 
that 
we 
shall 
deflect 
forces 
from 
our 
main 
work. 
And 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
provide 
the 
workers 
with 
real, 
comprehensive 
and 
live 
political 
knowledge, 
we 
must 
have 
"our 
own 
people," 
Social-Democrats, 
everywhere, 
among 
all 
social 
strata, 
and 


in 
all 
positions 
from 
which 
we 
can 
learn 
the 
inner 
springs 
of 
our 
state 



mechanism. 
Such 
people 
are 
required 
not 
only 
for 
propaganda 
and 
agitation, 
but 
in 
a 
still 
larger 
measure 
for 
organization. 


Is 
there 
scope 
for 
activity 
among 
all 
classes 
of 
the 
population? 
Those 
who 
fail 
to 
see 
this 
also 
lag, 
in 
their 
consciousness, 
behind 
the 
spontaneous 
awakening 
of 
the 
masses. 
The 
working-class 
movement 
has 
aroused 
and 
is 
continuing 
to 
arouse 
discontent 
in 
some, 
hopes 
for 
support 
for 
the 
opposition 
in 
others, 
and 
the 
consciousness 
of 
the 
intolerableness 
and 
inevitable 
downfall 
of 
the 
autocracy 
in 
still 
others. 
We 
would 
be 
"politicians" 
and 
Social-Democrats 
only 
in 
name 
(as 
actually 
very 
often 
happens), 
if 
we 
failed 
to 
realize 
that 
our 
task 
is 
to 
utilize 
every 
manifestation 
of 
discontent, 
and 
to 
collect 
and 
make 
the 
best 
of 
every 
grain 
of 
even 
rudimentary 
protest. 
This 
is 
quite 
apart 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
many 
millions 
of 
the 
labouring 
peasantry, 
handicraftsmen, 
petty 
artisans, 
etc., 
would 
always 
listen 
eagerly 
to 
the 
preachings 
of 
any 
at 
all 
able 
and 
intelligent 
Social-Democrat. 
Indeed, 
is 
there 
a 
single 
class 
of 
the 
population 
in 
which 
no 
individuals, 
groups 
or 
circles 
are 
to 
be 
found 
who 
are 
discontented 
with 
the 
lack 
of 
rights 
and 
with 
tyranny 
and, 
therefore, 
accessible 
to 
the 
propaganda 
of 
Social-Democrats 
as 
the 
spokesmen 
of 
the 
most 
pressing 
general 
democratic 
needs? 
To 
those 
who 
desire 
to 
have 
a 
clear 
idea 
of 
what 
the 
political 
agitation 
of 
a 
Social-
Democrat 
among 
all 
classes 
and 
strata 
of 
the 
population 
should 
be 
like, 
we 
would 
point 
to 
political 
exposures 
in 
the 
broad 
sense 
of 
the 
word 
as 
the 
principal 
(but 
of 
course 
not 
the 
sole) 
form 
of 
this 
agitation. 


"We 
must 
arouse 
in 
every 
section 
of 
the 
population 
that 
is 
at 
all 
enlightened 
a 
passion 
for 
political 
exposure," 
I 
wrote 
in 
my 
article 
"Where 
To 
Begin?" 
(Iskra, 
No. 
4, 
May 
1901), 
with 
which 
I 
shall 
deal 
in 
greater 


detail 
later. 
"We 
must 
not 
be 
discouraged 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
voice 
of 
political 
exposure 
is 
at 
present 
feeble, 
rare 
and 
timid. 
This 
is 
not 
because 
of 
a 
wholesale 
submission 
to 
police 
despotism, 
but 
because 
those 
who 
are 
able 
and 
ready 
to 
make 
exposures 
have 
no 
tribune 
from 
which 
to 
speak, 
no 
audience 
to 
listen 
eagerly 
and 
approve 
what 
the 
speakers 
say, 
and 
because 
the 
latter 
do 
not 
see 
anywhere 
among 
the 
people 
forces 
to 
whom 
it 
would 
be 
worth 
while 
directing 
their 
complaint 
against 
the 
'omnipotent' 
Russian 
government. 
. 
. 
. 
We 
are 
now 
in 
a 
position, 
and 
it 
is 
our 
duty, 
to 
provide 
a 
tribune 
for 
the 
nation-wide 
exposure 
of 
the 
tsarist 
government. 
That 
tribune 
must 
be 
a 
Social-Democratic 
paper."[69] 


The 
ideal 
audience 
for 
political 
exposures 
is 
the 
working 
class, 
which 
is 
first 
and 
foremost 
in 
need 
of 
all-round 
and 
live 
political 
knowledge, 
and 
is 



most 
capable 
of 
converting 
this 
knowledge 
into 
active 
struggle, 
even 
if 
it 
does 
not 
promise 
"palpable 
results." 
And 
the 
tribune 
for 
nationwide 
exposures 
can 
be 
only 
an 
all-Russian 
newspaper. 
"Without 
a 
political 
organ, 
a 
political 
movement 
deserving 
that 
name 
is 
inconceivable 
in 
modern 
Europe," 
and 
in 
this 
respect 
Russia 
must 
undoubtedly 
be 
included 
in 
modern 
Europe. 
The 
press 
has 
long 
ago 
become 
a 
power 
in 
our 
country, 
otherwise 
the 
government 
would 
not 
spend 
tens 
of 
thousands 
of 
rubles 
to 
bribe 
it, 
and 
to 
subsidize 
the 
Katkovs 
and 
Meshcherskys. 
And 
it 
is 
no 
novelty 
in 
autocratic 
Russia 
for 
the 
underground 
press 
to 
break 
through 
the 
wall 
of 
censorship 
and 
compel 
the 
legal 
and 
conservative 
press 
to 
speak 
openly 
of 
it. 
This 
was 
the 
case 
in 
the 
'seventies 
and 
even 
in 
the 
'fifties. 
How 
much 
broader 
and 
deeper 
are 
now 
those 
sections 
of 
the 
people 
that 
are 
prepared 
to 
read 
the 
illegal 
underground 
press, 
and 
to 
learn 
from 
it 
"how 
to 
live 
and 
how 
to 
die," 
to 
use 
the 
expression 
of 
a 
worker 
who 
sent 
a 
letter 
to 
the 
Iskra 
(No. 
7). 


[70] 
Political 
exposures 
are 
as 
much 
a 
declaration 
of 
war 
against 
the 
government 
as 
economic 
exposures 
are 
a 
declaration 
of 
war 
against 
the 
factory 
owners. 
And 
the 
moral 
significance 
of 
this 
declaration 
of 
war 
will 
be 
all 
the 
greater, 
the 
wider 
and 
more 
powerful 
this 
campaign 
of 
exposure 
is, 
the 
more 
numerous 
and 
determined 
the 
social 
class, 
which 
has 
declared 
war 
in 
order 
to 
commence 
the 
war. 
Hence, 
political 
exposures 
in 
themselves 
serve 
as 
a 
powerful 
instrument 
for 
disintegrating 
the 
system 
we 
oppose, 
a 
means 
for 
diverting 
from 
the 
enemy 
his 
casual 
or 
temporary 
allies, 
a 
means 
for 
spreading 
enmity 
and 
distrust 
among 
the 
permanent 
partners 
of 
the 
autocracy. 


Only 
a 
party 
that 
will 
organize 
really 
nation-wide 
exposures 
can 
become 
the 
vanguard 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
forces 
in 
our 
time. 
The 
word 
"nation-wide" 
has 
a 
very 
profound 
meaning. 
The 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
the 
non-working-class 
exposers 
(and 
in 
order 
to 
become 
the 
vanguard, 
we 
must 
attract 
other 
classes) 
are 
sober 
politicians 
and 
level-headed 
businessmen. 
They 
know 
perfectly 
well 
how 
dangerous 
it 
is 
to 
"complain" 
even 
against 
a 
minor 
official, 
let 
alone 
against 
the 
"omnipotent" 
Russian 
government. 
And 
they 
will 
come 
to 
us 
with 
their 
complaints 
only 
when 
they 
see 
that 
these 
complaints 
can 
really 
have 
effect, 
and 
that 
we 
represent 
a 
political 
force. 
In 
order 
to 
become 
such 
a 
force 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
outsiders, 
much 
persistent 
and 
stubborn 
work 
is 
required 
to 
raise 
our 
own 
consciousness, 
initiative 
and 
energy. 
To 
accomplish 
this 
it 
is 
not 
enough 
to 
attach 
a 
"vanguard" 
label 
on 
rearguard 
theory 
and 
practice. 



But 
if 
we 
have 
to 
undertake 
the 
organization 
of 
really 
nation-wide 
exposure 
of 
the 
government, 
what, 
then, 
will 
be 
the 
expression 
of 
the 
class 
character 
of 
our 
movement? 
--the 
over-zealous 
advocates 
of 
"close 
organic 
contact 
with 
the 
proletarian 
struggle" 
will 
ask 
us. 
The 
reply 
is: 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
Social-Democrats 
will 
organize 
these 
public 
exposures; 
that 
all 
the 
questions 
raised 
by 
the 
agitation 
will 
be 


elucidated 
in 
a 
consistently 
Social-Democratic 
spirit, 
without 
any 
concessions 
to 
deliberate 
or 
non-deliberate 
distortions 
of 
Marxism; 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
this 
all-round 
political 
agitation 
will 
be 
conducted 
by 
a 
party 
which 
unites 
into 
one 
inseparable 
whole 
the 
pressure 
upon 
the 
government 
in 
the 
name 
of 
the 
whole 
people, 
the 
revolutionary 
training 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
while 
safeguarding 
its 
political 
independence, 
and 
guidance 
of 
the 
economic 
struggle 
of 
the 
working 
class, 
the 
utilization 
of 
all 
its 
spontaneous 
conflicts 
with 
its 
exploiters 
which 
rouse 
and 
bring 
into 
our 
camp 
increasing 
numbers 
of 
the 
proletariat! 


But 
one 
of 
the 
most 
characteristic 
features 
of 
Economism 
is 
its 
failure 
to 
understand 
this 
connection, 
more, 
this 
identity 
of 
the 
most 
pressing 
needs 
of 
the 
proletariat 
(a 
comprehensible 
political 
education 
through 
the 
medium 
of 
political 
agitation 
and 
political 
exposures) 
with 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
general 
democratic 
movement. 
This 
lack 
of 
understanding 
is 
expressed 
not 
only 
in 
"Martynovite" 
phrases, 
but 
also 
in 
the 
references 
to 
a 
supposedly 
class 
point 
of 
view 
which 
is 
identical 
in 
meaning 
with 
these 
phrases. 
Here, 
for 
example, 
is 
how 
it 
is 
put 
by 
the 
authors 
of 
the 
"Economist" 
letter 
in 
No. 
12 
of 
the 
Iskra.* 
"This 
fundamental 
defect 
of 
the 
Iskra 
" 
(overestimating 
ideology) 
"is 
the 
cause 
of 
its 
inconsistency 
in 
the 
question 
of 
the 
attitude 
of 
Social-
Democrats 
to 
various 
social 
classes 
and 
tendencies. 
By 
a 
process 
of 
theoretical 


* 
Lack 
of 
space 
has 
prevented 
us 
from 
replying 
in 
full, 
in 
the 
Iskra, 
to 
this 
letter, 
which 
is 
extremely 
characteristic 
of 
the 
Economists. 
We 
were 
very 
glad 
it 
appeared, 
for 
rumours 
about 
the 
Iskra 
not 
maintaining 
a 
consistent, 
class 
point 
of 
view, 
have 
reached 
us 
long 
ago 
from 
various 
sources, 
and 
we 
have 
been 
waiting 
for 
an 
appropriate 
opportunity, 
or 
for 
a 
formulated 
expression 
of 
this 
current 
charge, 
to 
reply 
to 
it. 
And 
it 
is 
our 
habit 
to 
reply 
to 
attacks 
not 
by 
defence, 
but 
by 
counter-attacks. 
reasoning" 
(and 
not 
by 
"the 
growth 
of 
Party 
tasks, 
which 
grow 
together 
with 
the 
Party"), 
"the 
Iskra 
solved 
the 
problem 
of 
immediately 
proceeding 
to 
the 
struggle 
against 
absolutism. 
But 
in 
all 
probability 
it 
senses 
how 
difficult 
a 



task 
this 
would 
be 
for 
the 
workers 
in 
the 
present 
state 
of 
affairs" 
. 
. 
. 
(not 
only 
senses, 
but 
knows 
perfectly 
well 
that 
this 
task 
appears 
less 
difficult 
to 
the 
workers 
than 
to 
those 
"Economist" 
intellectuals 
who 
are 
concerned 
about 
little 
children, 
for 
the 
workers 
are 
prepared 
to 
fight 
even 
for 
demands 
which, 
to 
use 
the 
language 
of 
the 
never-to-be-forgotten 
Martynov, 
do 
not 
"promise 
palpable 
results") 
. 
. 
. 
"and 
lacking 
the 
patience 
to 
wait 
until 
the 
workers 
accumulate 
more 
strength 
for 
this 
struggle, 
the 
Iskra 
begins 
to 
search 
for 
allies 
in 
the 
ranks 
of 
the 
liberals 
and 
intelligentsia". 
. 
. 
. 


Yes, 
yes, 
we 
have 
indeed 
lost 
all 
"patience" 
to 
"wait" 
for 
the 
blessed 
time 
that 
has 
long 
been 
promised 
us 
by 
diverse 
"conciliators" 
when 
the 
Economists 
will 
stop 
throwing 
the 
blame 
for 
their 
own 
backwardness 
upon 
the 
workers, 
and 
stop 
justifying 
their 
own 
lack 
of 
energy 
by 
alleging 
that 
it 
is 
the 
workers 
who 
lack 
strength. 
We 
ask 
our 
Economists: 
what 
does 
"the 
working 
class 
accumulating 
more 
strength 
for 
this 
struggle" 
mean? 
Is 
it 
not 
evident 
that 
it 
means 
the 
political 
training 
of 
the 
workers, 
exposing 
to 
them 
all 
the 
aspects 
of 
our 
despicable 
autocracy? 
And 
is 
it 
not 
clear 
that 
precisely 
for 
this 
work 
we 
need 
"allies 
in 
the 
ranks 
of 
the 
liberals 
and 
intelligentsia," 
who 
are 
prepared 
to 
join 
us 
in 
the 
exposure 
of 
the 
political 
attack 
on 
the 
Zemstvos, 
on 
the 
teachers, 
on 
the 
statisticians, 
on 
the 
students, 
etc.? 
Is 
this 
surprisingly 
"intricate 
mechanism" 
really 
so 
difficult 
to 
understand? 
Has 
not 
P. 
B. 
Axelrod 
repeated 
to 
you 
over 
and 
over 
again 
since 
1897: 
"The 
problem 
of 
the 
Russian 
Social-Democrats 
acquiring 
adherents 
and 
direct 
and 
indirect 


allies 
among 
the 
non-proletarian 
classes 
will 
be 
solved 
principally 
and 
primarily 
by 
the 
character 
of 
the 
propagandist 
activities 
conducted 
among 
the 
proletariat 
itself"? 
But 
the 
Martynovs 
and 
the 
other 
Economists 
continue 
to 
imagine 
that 
"by 
economic 
struggle 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government," 
the 
workers 
must 
first 
accumulate 
strength 
(for 
trade-unionist 
politics) 
and 
then 
"go 
over" 
--we 
presume 
from 
trade-unionist 
"training 
for 
activity" 
--to 
Social-Democratic 
activity! 


". 
. 
. 
In 
its 
quest," 
continue 
the 
Economists, 
"the 
Iskra 
not 
infrequently 
departs 
from 
the 
class 
point 
of 
view, 
obscures 
class 
antagonisms 
and 
puts 
into 
the 
forefront 
the 
general 
character 
of 
the 
prevailing 
discontent 
with 
the 
government, 
notwithstanding 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
causes 
and 
the 
degree 
of 
this 
discontent 
vary 
quite 
considerably 
among 
the 
'allies.' 
Such, 
for 
example, 
is 
the 
Iskra's 
attitude 
towards 
the 
Zemstvo. 
. 
. 
." 
The 
Iskra, 
it 
is 
alleged, 
"promises 
the 
nobility, 
who 
are 
discontented 
with 
the 
government's 
sops, 
the 



aid 
of 
the 
working 
class, 
but 
does 
not 
say 
a 
word 
about 
the 
class 
antagonisms 
between 
these 
strata 
of 
the 
population." 
If 
the 
reader 
will 
turn 
to 
the 
articles 
"The 
Autocracy 
and 
the 
Zemstvo" 
(Nos. 
2 
and 
4 
of 
the 
Iskra), 
to 
which, 
in 
all 
probability, 
the 
authors 
of 
the 
letter 
refer, 
he 
will 
find 
that 
these 
articles[71] 
deal 
with 
the 
attitude 
of 
the 
government 
towards 
the 
"mild 
agitation 
of 
the 
bureaucratic 
Zemstvo, 
which 
is 
based 
on 
the 
Estates," 
and 
towards 
the 
"independent 
activity 
of 
even 
the 
propertied 
classes." 
In 
these 
articles 
it 
is 
stated 
that 
the 
workers 
cannot 
look 
on 
indifferently 
while 
the 
government 
is 
carrying 
on 
a 
fight 
against 
the 
Zemstvo, 
and 
the 
Zemstvo-ites 
are 
called 
upon 
to 
give 
up 
making 
mild 
speeches, 
and 
to 
speak 
firmly 
and 
resolutely 
when 
revolutionary 
Social-Democracy 
confronts 
the 
government 
in 
all 
its 
strength. 
What 


the 
authors 
of 
the 
letter 
do 
not 
agree 
with 
here 
is 
not 
clear. 
Do 
they 
think 
that 
the 
workers 
will 
"not 
understand" 
the 
phrases 
"propertied 
classes" 
and 
"bureaucratic 
Zemstvo 
based 
on 
the 
Estates"? 
Do 
they 
think 
that 
urging 
the 
Zemstvo 
to 
abandon 
mild 
speeches 
and 
to 
speak 
firmly 
and 
resolutely 
is 
"overestimating 
ideology"? 
Do 
they 
imagine 
the 
workers 
can 
"accumulate 
strength" 
for 
the 
fight 
against 
absolutism 
if 
they 
know 
nothing 
about 
the 
attitude 
of 
absolutism 
also 
towards 
the 
Zemstvo? 
All 
this 
too 
remains 
unknown. 
One 
thing 
alone 
is 
clear 
and 
that 
is 
that 
the 
authors 
of 
the 
letter 
have 
a 
very 
vague 
idea 
of 
what 
the 
political 
tasks 
of 
Social-Democracy 
are. 
This 
is 
revealed 
still 
more 
clearly 
by 
their 
remark: 
"Such 
also" 
(i.e., 
also 
"obscures 
class 
antagonisms") 
"is 
the 
Iskra's 
attitude 
towards 
the 
student 
movement." 
Instead 
of 
calling 
upon 
the 
workers 
to 
declare 
by 
means 
of 
public 
demonstrations 
that 
the 
real 
centre 
of 
unbridled 
violence, 
disorder 
and 
outrage 
is 
not 
the 
students 
but 
the 
Russian 
government 
(Iskra, 
No. 
2 
[72]), 
we 
should, 
no 
doubt, 
have 
inserted 
arguments 
in 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
! 
And 
such 
ideas 
are 
expressed 
by 
Social-Democrats 
in 
the 
autumn 
of 
1901, 
after 
the 
events 
of 
February 
and 
March, 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
a 
fresh 
revival 
of 
the 
student 
movement, 
which 
reveals 
that 
even 
in 
this 
sphere 
the 
"spontaneous" 
protest 
against 
the 
autocracy 
is 
outstripping 
the 
conscious 
Social-Democratic 
leadership 
of 
the 
movement. 
The 
spontaneous 
striving 
of 
the 
workers 
to 
stand 
up 
for 
the 
students 
who 
are 
being 
beaten 
up 
by 
the 
police 
and 
the 
Cossacks 
is 
outstripping 
the 
conscious 
activity 
of 
the 
Social-
Democratic 
organization! 


"And 
yet 
in 
other 
articles," 
continue 
the 
authors 
of 
the 
letter, 
"the 
Iskra 
sharply 
condemns 
all 
compromises, 
and 
defends, 
for 
example, 
the 



intolerant 
conduct 
of 
the 
Guesdites." 
We 
would 
advise 
those 
who 
usually 
so 
conceitedly 
and 
friv


olously 
declare 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
disagreements 
existing 
among 
the 
contemporary 
Social-Democrats 
that 
they 
are 
of 
a 
minor 
nature 
and 
do 
not 
justify 
a 
split, 
to 
ponder 
very 
deeply 
over 
these 
words. 
Is 
it 
possible 
to 
have 
successful 
activity, 
within 
one 
organization, 
by 
people 
who 
say 
that 
so 
far 
we 
have 
done 
astonishingly 
little 
to 
explain 
the 
hostility 
of 
the 
autocracy 
towards 
the 
various 
classes, 
and 
to 
inform 
the 
workers 
of 
the 
opposition 
of 
the 
various 
strata 
of 
the 
population 
towards 
the 
autocracy, 
and 
by 
people 
who 
see 
in 
this 
a 
"compromise" 
--evidently 
a 
compromise 
with 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
"economic 
struggle 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government"? 


We 
urged 
the 
necessity 
of 
introducing 
the 
class 
struggle 
in 
the 
rural 
districts 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
the 
fortieth 
anniversary 
of 
the 
emancipation 
of 
the 
peasantry 
(No. 
3 
[73]), 
and 
spoke 
of 
the 
irreconcilability 
between 
the 
local 
government 
bodies 
and 
the 
autocracy 
in 
connection 
with 
Witte's 
secret 
memorandum. 
(No. 
4.) 
In 
connection 
with 
the 
new 
law 
we 
attacked 
the 
feudal 
landlords 
and 
the 
government 
which 
serves 
them 
(No. 
8 
[74]), 
and 
welcomed 
the 
illegal 
Zemstvo 
congress. 
We 
urged 
the 
Zemstvo 
to 
stop 
making 
degrading 
petitions 
(No. 
8 
[75]), 
and 
to 
come 
out 
and 
fight. 
We 
encouraged 
the 
students, 
who 
had 
begun 
to 
understand 
the 
need 
for, 
and 
to 
take 
up, 
the 
political 
struggle 
(No. 
3) 
and, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
we 
lashed 
out 
at 
the 
"barbarous 
lack 
of 
understanding" 
revealed 
by 
the 
adherents 
of 
the 
"purely 
student" 
movement, 
who 
called 
upon 
the 
students 
to 
abstain 
from 
taking 
part 
in 
the 
street 
demonstrations 
(No. 
3, 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
manifesto 
issued 
by 
the 
Executive 
Committee 
of 
the 
Moscow 
students 
on 
February 
25). 
We 
exposed 
the 
"senseless 
dreams" 
and 
the 
"Iying 
hypocrisy" 
of 
the 
cunning 
liberals 
of 
the 
Rossiya 
[76] 
(No. 
5) 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
we 
commented 
on 


the 
fury 
with 
which 
"peaceful 
writers, 
aged 
professors, 
scientists 
and 
well-known 
liberal 
Zemstvo-ites 
were 
manhandled" 
in 
the 
government's 
torture 
chambers. 
(No. 
5, 
"Police 
Raid 
on 
Literature.") 
We 
exposed 
the 
real 
significance 
of 
the 
program 
of 
"state 
concern 
for 
the 
welfare 
of 
the 
workers," 
and 
welcomed 
the 
"valuable 
admission" 
that 
"it 
is 
better 
by 
granting 
reforms 
from 
above 
to 
forestall 
the 
demand 
for 
such 
reforms 
from 
below, 
than 
to 
wait 
for 
those 
demands 
to 
be 
put 
forward." 
(No. 
6.[77]) 
We 
encouraged 
the 
protesting 
statisticians 
(No. 
7), 
and 
censured 
the 
strikebreaking 
statisticians. 
(No. 
9.) 
He 
who 
sees 
in 
these 
tactics 
an 
obscuring 
of 
the 
class 
consciousness 



of 
the 
proletariat 
and 
compromise 
with 
liberalism 
shows 
that 
he 
absolutely 
fails 
to 
understand 
the 
true 
significance 
of 
the 
program 
of 
the 
Credo 
and 
is 
carrying 
out 
that 
program 
de 
facto, 
however 
much 
he 
may 
repudiate 
it! 
Because 
by 
that 
he 
drags 
Social-Democracy 
towards 
the 
"economic 
struggle 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government" 
and 
yields 
to 
liberalism, 
abandons 
the 
task 
of 
actively 
intervening 
in 
every 
"liberal" 
issue 
and 
of 
defining 
his 
own, 
Social-Democratic, 
attitude 
towards 
this 
question. 



F. 
AGAIN 
"SLANDERERS," 
AGAIN 
"MYSTIFIERS" 
These 
polite 
expressions, 
as 
the 
reader 
will 
recall, 
belong 
to 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
which 
in 
this 
way 
answers 
our 
charge 
that 
it 
"is 
indirectly 
preparing 
the 
ground 
for 
converting 
the 
working-class 
movement 
into 
an 
instrument 
of 
bourgeois 
democracy." 
In 
its 
simplicity 
of 
heart 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
decided 
that 
this 
accusation 
was 
nothing 
more 
than 
a 
polemical 
sally, 
as 
if 
to 
say, 
these 
malicious 
doctrinaires 
have 


made 
up 
their 
minds 
to 
say 
all 
sorts 
of 
unpleasant 
things 
about 
us; 
now 
what 
can 
be 
more 
unpleasant 
than 
being 
an 
instrument 
of 
bourgeois 
democracy? 
And 
so 
they 
print 
in 
bold 
type 
a 
"refutation": 
"Nothing 
but 
downright 
slander" 
(Two 
Congresses, 
p. 
30), 
"mystification" 
(p. 
31), 
"masquerade" 
(p. 
33). 
Like 
Jupiter, 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
(although 
it 
has 
little 
resemblance 
to 
Jupiter) 
is 
angry 
because 
it 
is 
wrong, 
and 
proves 
by 
its 
hasty 
abuse 
that 
it 
is 
incapable 
of 
understanding 
its 
opponents' 
mode 
of 
reasoning. 
And 
yet, 
with 
only 
a 
little 
reflection 
it 
would 
have 
understood 
why 
all 
worship 
of 
the 
spontaneity 
of 
the 
mass 
movement 
and 
any 
degrading 
of 
Social-Democratic 
politics 
to 
trade-unionist 
politics 
mean 
precisely 
preparing 
the 
ground 
for 
converting 
the 
working-class 
movement 
into 
an 
instrument 
of 
bourgeois 
democracy. 
The 
spontaneous 
working-class 
movement 
by 
itself 
is 
able 
to 
create 
(and 
inevitably 
creates) 
only 
trade 
unionism, 
and 
working-class 
trade-unionist 
politics 
are 
precisely 
working-
class 
bourgeois 
politics. 
The 
fact 
that 
the 
working 
class 
participates 
in 
the 
political 
struggle, 
and 
even 
in 
political 
revolution, 
does 
not 
in 
itself 
make 
its 
politics 
Social-Democratic 
politics. 
Will 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
make 
bold 
to 
deny 
that? 
Will 
it, 
at 
long 
last, 
publicly, 
plainly 
and 
without 
equivocation 
explain 
just 
how 
it 
understands 
the 
urgent 
questions 
of 
the 
international 
and 
of 
the 
Russian 
Social-Democratic 
movement? 
Oh 
no, 
it 
will 
never 
pluck 
up 
the 
courage 
to 
do 
anything 
of 
the 
kind, 
because 
it 
holds 
fast 
to 
the 
trick, 
which 
might 
be 
described 
as 
saying 
"no" 
to 
everything: 
"It's 
not 
me; 
it's 
not 
my 
horse; 
I'm 
not 
the 
driver. 
We 
are 
not 
Economists; 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
does 
not 
stand 
for 
Economism; 
there 
is 
no 
Economism 
at 
all 
in 
Russia." 
This 
is 
a 
remarkably 
adroit 
and 
"political" 
trick, 
which 
suffers 
from 
the 
slight 
defect, 
however, 
that 
the 
publications 


practising 
it 
are 
usually 
nicknamed 
"Anything 
you 
wish, 
sir." 


The 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
imagines 
that 
in 
general 
bourgeois 
democracy 
in 



Russia 
is 
merely 
a 
"phantom" 
(Two 
Congresses, 
p. 
32).[*] 
Happy 
people! 
Like 
the 
ostrich, 
they 
bury 
their 
heads 
in 
the 
sand, 
and 
imagine 
that 
everything 
around 
has 
disappeared. 
Liberal 
publicists 
who 
month 
after 
month 
proclaim 
to 
the 
world 
their 
triumph 
over 
the 
collapse 
and 
even 
disappearance 
of 
Marxism; 
liberal 
newspapers 
(the 
S. 
Peterburgskiye 
Vedomosti,[78] 
the 
Russkiye 
Vedomosti, 
and 
many 
others) 
which 
encourage 
the 
liberals 
who 
bring 
to 
the 
workers 
the 
Brentano[79] 
conception 
of 
the 
class 
struggle 
and 
the 
trade-unionist 
conception 
of 
politics; 
the 
galaxy 
of 
critics 
of 
Marxism, 
whose 
real 
tendencies 
were 
so 
very 
well 
disclosed 
by 
the 
Credo 
and 
whose 
literary 
products 
alone 
circulate 
in 
Russia 
without 
let 
or 
hindrance; 
the 
revival 
of 
revolutionary 
non-Social-Democratic 
tendencies, 
particularly 
after 
the 
February 
and 
March 
events 
--all 
these, 
apparently, 
are 
just 
phantoms! 
All 
these 
have 
nothing 
at 
all 
to 
do 
with 
bourgeois 
democracy! 


The 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
and 
the 
authors 
of 
the 
Economist 
letter 
published 
in 
the 
Iskra, 
No. 
12, 
should 
"ponder 
over 
the 
reason 
why 
the 
events 
of 
the 
spring 
brought 
about 
such 
a 
revival 
of 
revolutionary 
non-Social-
Democratic 
tendencies 


* 
There 
follows 
a 
reference 
to 
the 
"concrete 
Russian 
conditions 
which 
fatalistically 
impel 
the 
working-class 
movement 
onto 
the 
revolutionary 
path." 
But 
these 
people 
refuse 
to 
understand 
that 
the 
revolutionary 
path 
of 
the 
working-class 
movement 
might 
not 
be 
a 
Social-Democratic 
path! 
When 
absolutism 
reigned, 
the 
entire 
West-European 
bourgeoisie 
"impelled," 
deliberately 
impelled, 
the 
workers 
onto 
the 
path 
of 
revolution. 
We 
Social-
Democrats, 
however, 
cannot 
be 
satisfied 
with 
that. 
And 
if 
we, 
by 
any 
means 
whatever, 
degrade 
Social-Democratic 
politics 
to 
the 
level 
of 
spontaneous 
trade-unionist 
politics, 
we, 
by 
that, 
play 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
bourgeois 
democracy. 
instead 
of 
increasing 
the 
authority 
and 
the 
prestige 
of 
Social-Democracy" 
The 
reason 
was 
that 
we 
were 
not 
up 
to 
the 
tasks 
confronting 
us. 
The 
masses 
of 
the 
workers 
proved 
to 
be 
more 
active 
than 
we; 
we 
lacked 
adequately 
trained 
revolutionary 
leaders 
and 
organizers 
with 
a 
thorough 
knowledge 
of 
the 
mood 
prevailing 
among 
all 
the 
opposition 
strata 
and 
able 
to 
march 
at 
the 
head 
of 
the 
movement, 
turn 
a 
spontaneous 
demonstration 
into 
a 
political 
one, 
broaden 
its 
political 
character, 
etc. 
Under 
such 
circumstances, 
our 
backwardness 
will 
inevitably 
be 
utilized 
by 
the 
more 
mobile 
and 
more 
energetic 
non-Social-Democratic 
revolutionaries, 
and 
the 
workers, 
no 
matter 
how 
strenuously 
and 
self-sacrificingly 
they 
may 
fight 
the 
police 
and 
the 



troops, 
no 
matter 
how 
revolutionary 
their 
actions 
may 
be, 
will 
prove 
to 
be 
merely 
a 
force 
supporting 
these 
revolutionaries, 
the 
rearguard 
of 
bourgeois 
democracy, 
and 
not 
the 
Social-Democratic 
vanguard. 
Take, 
for 
example, 
the 
German 
Social-Democrats, 
whose 
weak 
aspects 
alone 
our 
Economists 
desire 
to 
emulate. 
Why 
is 
it 
that 
not 
a 
single 
political 
event 
takes 
place 
in 
Germany 
without 
adding 
to 
the 
authority 
and 
prestige 
of 
Social-Democracy? 
Because 
Social-Democracy 
is 
always 
found 
to 
be 
in 
advance 
of 
all 
others 
in 
that 
it 
furnishes 
the 
most 
revolutionary 
appraisal 
of 
every 
given 
event 
and 
by 
its 
championship 
of 
every 
protest 
against 
tyranny. 
It 
does 
not 
lull 
itself 
with 
disquisitions 
about 
the 
economic 
struggle 
bringing 
the 
workers 
up 
against 
their 
own 
lack 
of 
rights 
and 
about 
concrete 
conditions 
fatalistically 
impelling 
the 
working-class 
movement 
onto 
the 
path 
of 
revolution. 
It 
intervenes 
in 
every 
sphere 
and 
in 
every 
question 
of 
social 
and 
political 
life: 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
Wilhelm's 
refusal 
to 
endorse 
a 
bourgeois 
progressive 
as 
city 
mayor 
(our 
Economists 
have 
not 
yet 
managed 
to 
convince 
the 
Germans 
that 
this, 
in 
fact, 
is 
a 
compromise 
with 


liberalism!); 
in 
the 
question 
of 
the 
law 
against 
"immoral" 
publications 
and 
pictures; 
in 
the 
question 
of 
the 
government 
influencing 
the 
election 
of 
professors, 
etc., 
etc. 
Everywhere 
the 
Social-Democrats 
are 
found 
to 
be 
ahead 
of 
all 
others, 
rousing 
political 
discontent 
among 
all 
classes, 
rousing 
the 
sluggards, 
pushing 
on 
the 
laggards 
and 
providing 
a 
wealth 
of 
material 
for 
the 
development 
of 
the 
political 
consciousness 
and 
political 
activity 
of 
the 
proletariat. 
The 
result 
of 
all 
this 
is 
that 
even 
the 
avowed 
enemies 
of 
Socialism 
are 
filled 
with 
respect 
for 
this 
advanced 
political 
fighter, 
and 
not 
unfrequently 
an 
important 
document 
from 
bourgeois, 
and 
even 
from 
bureaucratic 
and 
Court 
circles, 
makes 
its 
way 
by 
some 
miraculous 
means 
into 
the 
editorial 
office 
of 
the 
Vorwärts. 


This, 
then, 
is 
the 
explanation 
of 
the 
seeming 
"contradiction" 
which 
is 
so 
much 
beyond 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
that 
it 
raises 
its 
arms 
and 
cries: 
"Masquerade!" 
Indeed, 
just 
think 
of 
it: 
We, 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
regard 
the 
mass 
working-class 
movement 
as 
the 
cornerstone 
(and 
say 
so 
in 
bold 
type!); 
we 
warn 
all 
and 
sundry 
against 
belittling 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
spontaneous 
movement; 
we 
desire 
to 
lend 
the 
economic 
struggle 
itself, 
itself, 
itself, 
a 
political 
character; 
we 
desire 
to 
maintain 
close 
and 
organic 
contact 
with 
the 
proletarian 
struggle! 
And 
yet 
we 
are 
told 
that 
we 
are 
preparing 
the 
ground 
for 
converting 
the 
working 
class 
movement 
into 
an 
instrument 
of 
bourgeois 
democracy! 
And 
who 
says 
this? 
People 
who 



"compromise" 
with 
liberalism, 
intervene 
in 
every 
"liberal" 
issue 
(what 
a 
gross 
misunderstanding 
of 
"organic 
contact 
with 
the 
proletarian 
struggle"!), 
who 
devote 
so 
much 
attention 
to 
the 
students 
and 
even 
(Oh 
horror!) 
to 
the 
Zemstvo-ites! 
People 
who 
wish 
to 
devote 
a 
greater 
(compared 
with 
the 
Economists) 
percent


age 
of 
their 
efforts 
to 
activity 
among 
non-proletarian 
classes 
of 
the 
population! 
Is 
not 
this 
a 
"masquerade"? 
Poor 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
! 
Will 
it 
ever 
find 
the 
solution 
to 
this 
complicated 
puzzle? 



IV. 
The 
Amateurishness 
Of 
The 
Economists 
And 
An 
Organization 
Of 
Revolutionaries 

The 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo's 
assertions 
--which 
we 
have 
analyzed 
above 
-that 
the 
economic 
struggle 
is 
the 
most 
widely 
applicable 
means 
of 
political 
agitation 
and 
that 
our 
task 
now 
is 
to 
lend 
the 
economic 
struggle 
itself 
a 
political 
character, 
etc., 
express 
a 
narrow 
view 
not 
only 
of 
our 
political, 
but 
also 
of 
our 
organi~ational 
tasks. 
The 
"economic 
struggle 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government" 
does 
not 
in 
the 
least 
re 
quire 
--and 
therefore 
such 
a 
struggle 
can 
never 
give 
rise 
to 
--an 
all-Russian 
centralized 
organization 
that 
will 
combine, 
in 
one 
general 
onslaught, 
all 
and 
every 
manifestation 
of 
political 
opposition, 
protest 
and 
indignation, 
an 
organization 
that 
will 
consist 
of 
professional 
revolutionaries 
and 
be 
led 
by 
the 
real 
political 
leaders 
of 
the 
whole 
people. 
This 
is 
but 
natural. 
The 
character 
of 
any 
organization 
is 
naturally 
and 
inevitably 
determined 
by 
the 
content 
of 
its 
activity. 
Consequently, 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
by 
the 
assertions 
analyzed 
above, 
sanctifies 
and 
legitimatizes 
not 
only 
the 
narrowness 
of 
political 
activity, 
but 
also 
the 
narrowness 
of 
organization 
al 
work. 
In 
this 
case 
too, 
as 
always, 
it 
is 
an 
organ 
whose 
consciousness 
yields 
to 
spontaneity. 
And 
yet 
the 
worship 
of 
spontaneously 
developing 
forms 
of 
organization, 
failure 
to 
realize 
how 
narrow 
and 
primitive 
is 
our 
organizational 
work, 
what 
amateurs 
we 
still 
are 
in 
this 
most 
important 
sphere, 
failure 
to 
realize 
this, 
I 
say, 
is 
a 
veritable 
disorder 
from 
which 
our 
movement 
suffers. 
It 
is 
not 
a 
disorder 
that 
comes 
with 
decline, 
it 
is, 
of 
course, 
a 
disorder 
that 
comes 
with 
growth. 
But 
it 
is 
precisely 
at 
the 
present 
time, 
when 
the 
wave 
of 
spontaneous 
indignation, 
as 
it 
were, 
sweeps 
over 
us, 
leaders 
and 
organizers 
of 
the 
movement, 
that 
a 
most 
ir 
reconcilable 
struggle 
must 
be 
waged 
against 
all 
defence 
of 
backwardness, 
against 
any 
legitimization 
of 
narrowness 
in 
this 
matter, 
and 
it 
is 
particularly 
necessary 
to 
rouse 
in 
all 
who 
take 
part 
in 
practical 
work, 
in 
all 
who 
are 
preparing 
to 
take 
up 
their 
work, 
discontent 
with 
the 
amateurishness 
that 
prevails 
among 
us 
and 
an 
unshakable 
determination 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
it. 



A. 
WHAT 
IS 
AMATEURISHNESS? 
We 
shall 
try 
to 
answer 
this 
question 
by 
giving 
a 
brief 
description 
of 
the 
activity 
of 
a 
typical 
Social-Democratic 
circle 
of 
the 
period 
of 
1894-1901. 
We 
have 
already 
noted 
that 
the 
entire 
student 
youth 
of 
the 
period 
was 
absorbed 
in 
Marxism. 
Of 
course, 
these 
students 
were 
not 
only, 
or 
even 
not 
so 
much, 
absorbed 
in 
Marxism 
as 
a 
theory, 
but 
as 
an 
answer 
to 
the 
question: 
"What 
is 
to 
be 
done?"; 
as 
a 
call 
to 
take 
the 
field 
against 
the 
enemy. 
And 
these 
new 
warriors 
marched 
to 
battle 


with 
astonishingly 
primitive 
equipment 
and 
training. 
In 
a 
vast 
number 
of 
cases, 
they 
had 
almost 
no 
equipment 
and 
absolutely 
no 
training. 
They 
marched 
to 
war 
like 
peasants 
from 
the 
plough, 
armed 
only 
with 
clubs. 
A 
students' 
circle, 
having 
no 
contacts 
whatever 
with 
the 
old 
members 
of 
the 
movement, 
no 
contacts 
with 
circles 
in 
other 
districts, 
or 
even 
in 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
same 
city 
(or 
with 
other 
universities), 
without 
the 
various 
sections 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
work 
being 
in 
any 
way 
organized, 
having 
no 
systematic 
plan 
of 
activity 
covering 
any 
length 
of 
time, 
establishes 
contacts 
with 
the 
workers 
and 
sets 
to 
work. 
The 
circle 
gradually 
expansds 
its 
propaganda 
and 
agitation; 
by 
its 
activities 
it 
wins 
the 
sympathies 
of 
rather 
large 
sections 
of 
workers 
and 
of 
a 
certain 
section 
of 
the 
educated 
classes, 
which 
provide 
it 
with 
money 
and 
from 
among 
whom 
the 
"committee" 
recruits 
new 
groups 
of 
young 
people. 
There 
is 
a 
growing 
fascination 
about 
the 
committee 
(or 
League 
of 
Struggle), 
its 
sphere 
of 
activity 
becomes 
wider 
and 
its 
activities 
expand 
quite 
spontaneously: 
the 
very 
people 
who 
a 
year 
or 
a 
few 
months 
previously 
had 
spoken 
at 
the 
gatherings 
of 
the 
students' 
circle 
and 
discussed 
the 
question, 
"Whither?", 
who 
established 
and 
maintained 
contacts 
with 
the 
workers, 
wrote 
and 
published 
leaflets, 
now 
establish 
contacts 
with 
other 
groups 
of 
revolutionaries, 
procure 
literature, 
set 
to 
work 
to 
publish 
a 
local 
newspaper, 
begin 
to 
talk 
about 
organizing 
a 
demonstration, 
and 
finally, 
commence 
open 
hostilities 
(these 
open 
hostilities 
may, 
according 
to 
circumstances, 
take 
the 
form 
of 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
very 
first 
agitational 
leaflet, 
or 
the 
first 
issue 
of 
a 
newspaper, 
or 
of 
the 
organization 
of 
the 
first 
demonstration). 
And 
usually 
the 
very 
first 
of 
these 
actions 
ends 
in 
immediate 
and 
wholesale 
arrests. 
Immediate 
and 
wholesale, 
precisely 
because 
these 


open 
hostilities 
were 
not 
the 
result 
of 
a 
systematic 
and 
carefully 
thought-
out 
and 
gradually 
prepared 
plan 
for 
a 
prolonged 
and 
stubborn 
struggle, 
but 



simply 
the 
result 
of 
the 
spontaneous 
growth 
of 
traditional 
circle 
work; 
because, 
naturally, 
the 
police, 
in 
almost 
every 
case, 
knew 
the 
principal 
leaders 
of 
the 
local 
movement, 
for 
they 
had 
already 
"won 
a 
reputation" 
for 
themselves 
in 
their 
school 
days, 
and 
the 
police 
waited 
only 
for 
a 
convenient 
moment 
to 
make 
their 
raid, 
deliberately 
allowing 
the 
circle 
sufficient 
time 
to 
develop 
its 
work 
so 
that 
they 
might 
obtain 
a 
palpable 
corpus 
delicti, 
and 
always 
permitted 
several 
of 
the 
persons 
known 
to 
them 
to 
remain 
at 
liberty 
in 
order 
to 
act 
as 
"breeders" 
(which, 
I 
believe, 
is 
the 
technical 
term 
used 
both 
by 
our 
people 
and 
by 
the 
gendarmes). 
One 
cannot 
help 
comparing 
this 
kind 
of 
warfare 
with 
that 
conducted 
by 
a 
mob 
of 
peasants, 
armed 
with 
clubs, 
against 
modern 
troops. 
And 
one 
can 
only 
wonder 
at 
the 
virility 
of 
the 
movement 
which 
expanded, 
grew 
and 
scored 
victories 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
total 
lack 
of 
training 
among 
the 
fighters. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
from 
the 
historical 
point 
of 
view, 
the 
primitiveness 
of 
equipment 
was 
not 
only 
inevitable 
at 
first, 
but 
even 
legitimate 
as 
one 
of 
the 
conditions 
for 
the 
wide 
recruiting 
of 
fighters, 
but 
as 
soon 
as 
serious 
war 
operations 
commenced 
(and 
they 
commenced 
in 
fact 
with 
the 
strikes 
in 
the 
summer 
of 
1896), 
the 
defects 
in 
our 
fighting 
organizations 
made 
themselves 
felt 
to 
an 
ever-increasing 
degree. 
Thrown 
into 
confusion 
at 
first 
and 
committing 
a 
number 
of 
mistakes 
(for 
example, 
its 
appeal 
to 
the 
public 
describing 
the 
misdeeds 
of 
the 
Socialists, 
or 
the 
deportation 
of 
workers 
from 
the 
capital 
to 
provincial 
industrial 
centres), 
the 
government 
very 
soon 
adapted 
itself 
to 
the 
new 
conditions 
of 
the 
struggle 
and 
managed 
to 
deploy 
its 
perfectly 
equipped 
detachments 
of 


agents 
provocateurs, 
spies 
and 
gendarmes. 
Raids 
became 
so 
frequent, 
affected 
such 
a 
vast 
number 
of 
people 
and 
cleared 
out 
the 
local 
circles 
so 
thoroughly 
that 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers 
literally 
lost 
all 
their 
leaders, 
the 
movement 
assumed 
an 
incredibly 
sporadic 
character, 
and 
it 
became 
utterly 
impossible 
to 
establish 
continuity 
and 
coherence 
in 
the 
work. 
The 
terrible 
dispersion 
of 
the 
local 
leaders, 
the 
accidental 
character 
of 
the 
circle 
memberships, 
the 
lack 
of 
training 
in 
and 
the 
narrow 
outlook 
on 
theoretical, 
political, 
and 
organizational 
questions 
were 
all 
the 
inevitable 
result 
of 
the 
conditions 
described 
above. 
Things 
reached 
such 
a 
pass 
that 
in 
several 
places 
the 
workers, 
because 
of 
our 
lack 
of 
stamina 
and 
ability 
to 
maintain 
secrecy, 
began 
to 
lose 
faith 
in 
the 
intelligentsia 
and 
to 
avoid 
them; 
the 
intellectuals, 
they 
said, 
are 
much 
too 
careless 
and 
lay 
themselves 
open 
to 
police 
raids! 


Anyone 
who 
has 
the 
slightest 
knowledge 
of 
the 
movement 
is 
aware 
that 
all 
thinking 
Social-Democrats 
have 
at 
last 
begun 
to 
regard 
these 



primitive 
methods 
as 
a 
disease. 
And 
in 
order 
that 
the 
reader 
who 
is 
not 
acquainted 
with 
the 
movement 
may 
have 
no 
grounds 
for 
thinking 
that 
we 
are 
"inventing" 
a 
special 
stage 
or 
special 
disease 
of 
the 
movement, 
we 
shall 
refer 
once 
again 
to 
the 
witness 
we 
have 
already 
quoted. 
We 
hope 
we 
shall 
be 
forgiven 
for 
the 
length 
of 
the 
quotation: 


"While 
the 
gradual 
transition 
to 
more 
extensive 
practical 
activity," 
writes 
B-v 
in 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No. 
6, 
"a 
transition 
which 
is 
directly 
dependent 
on 
the 
general 
transitional 
period 
through 
which 
the 
Russian 
working-class 
movement 
is 
now 
passing, 
is 
a 
characteristic 
feature 
. 
. 
. 
there 
is, 
however, 
another 
and 
not 
less 
interesting 
feature 
in 
the 
general 
mechanism 
of 
the 
Russian 
workers' 
revolution. 
We 
refer 
to 
the 
general 
lack 
of 
revolutionary 
forces 
fit 
for 
action* 
which 
is 
felt 
not 
only 
in 
St. 
Petersburg, 
but 
throughout 
the 
whole 
of 
Russia.

revival 
of 
the 
working-class 
movement, 
the 
general 
development 
of 
the 
working 
masses,

frequency 
of 
strikes, 
and 
with 
the 
mass 
struggle 
of 
the 
workers 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
open, 
which 
intensifies 
government 
persecution, 
arrests, 
deportation 
and 
exile, 
this 
lack 
of 
highly 
skilled 
revolutionary 
forces 
is 
becoming 
increasingly 
marked 
and, 
without 
a 
doubt, 
cannot 
but 
affect 
the 
depth 
and 
the 
general 
character 
of 
the 
movement. 
Many 
strikes 
take 
place 
without 
the 
revolutionary 
organizations 
exercising 
any 
strong 
and 
direct 
influence 
upon 
them. 
. 
. 
. 
A 
shortage 
of 
agitational 
leaflets 
and 
illegal 
literature 
is 
felt. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
workers' 
circles 
are 
left 
without 
agitators. 
. 
. 
. 
In 
addition, 
there 
is 
a 
constant 
shortage 
of 
funds. 
In 
a 
word, 
the 
growth 
of 
the 
working-class 
movement 
is 
outstripping 
the 
growth 
and 
development 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
organizations. 
The 
numerical 
strength 
of 
the 
active 
revolutionaries 
is 
too 
small 
for 
them 
to 
concentrate 
in 
their 
own 
hands 
the 
influence 
exercised 
upon 
the 
whole 
mass 
of 
discontented 
workers, 
or 
to 
give 
this 
discontent 
even 
a 
shadow 
of 
coherence 
and 
organization. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
separate 
circles 
and 
individual 
revolutionaries 
are 
not 
brought 
together 
and 
united, 
and 
do 
not 
represent 
a 
single, 
strong 
and 
disciplined 
organization 
with 
the 
planned 
development 
of 
its 
parts. 
. 
. 
." 
And 
admitting 
that 
the 
immediate 
organization 
of 
fresh 
circles 
to 
replace 
those 
that 
have 
been 
broken 
up 
"merely 
proves 
the 
virility 
of 
the 
movement 
. 
. 
. 
but 
does 
not 
prove 
the 
existence 
of 
an 
adequate 
number 
of 
sufficiently 
fit 
revolutionary 
workers," 
the 
author 
concludes: 
"The 
lack 
of 
practical 
training 
among 
the 
St. 
Petersburg 
revolutionaries 
is 
seen 
in 
the 
results 
of 
their 
work. 
The 
recent 



trials, 
especially 
that 
of 
the 
Self-Emancipation 
group 
and 
the 
Labour 
versus 
Capital 
group,[80] 
clearly 
showed 
that 
the 
young 
agitator, 
lacking 
a 
detailed 
knowledge 
of 
the 
conditions 
of 
labour 
and, 
consequently, 
of 
the 
conditions 
under 
which 
agitation 
can 
be 
carried 
on 
in 
a 
given 
factory, 
ignorant 
of 
the 
principles 
of 
secrecy, 
and 
understanding 
only 
the 
general 
principles 
of 
Social-
Democracy" 
(but 
does 
he 
understand?) 
"is 
able 
to 
carry 
on 
his 
work 
for 
perhaps 
four, 
five 
or 
six 
months. 
Then 
come 
arrests, 
which 
frequently 
lead 
to 
the 
breakup 
of 
the 
whole 
organization, 
or 
at 
all 
events, 
part 
of 
it. 
The 
question 
arises, 
therefore, 
can 
the 
group 
conduct 
successful 
and 
fruitful 
activity 
if 
its 
existence 
is 
measured 
by 
months? 
. 
. 
. 
Obviously, 
the 
defects 
of 
the 
existing 
organizations 
cannot 
be 
wholly 
ascribed 
to 
the 
transitional 
period. 
. 
. 
. 
Obviously, 
the 
numerical 
and 
above 
all 
the 
qualitative 
make-up 
of 
the 
functioning 
organizations 
is 
no 
small 
factor,

the 
first 
task 
our 
Social-
Democrats 
must 
undertake

is 
effectively

combine

B. 
AMATEURISHNESS 
AND 
ECONOMISM 
We 
must 
now 
deal 
with 
a 
question 
that 
has 
undoubtedly 
arisen 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
every 
reader. 
Can 
a 
connection 
be 
established 
between 
amateurishness, 
this 
disorder 
of 
growth 
affecting 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
movement, 
and 
Economism, 
which 
is 
one 
of 
the 
trends 
in 
Russian 
Social-Democracy? 
We 
think 
that 
it 
can. 
Lack 
of 
practical 
training, 
lack 
of 
ability 
to 
carry 
on 
organizational 
work 
is 
certainly 
common 
to 
us 
all, 
including 
those 
who 
have 
from 
the 
very 
outset 
unswervingly 
stood 
for 
revolutionary 
Marxism. 
And, 
of 
course, 
were 
it 
only 
lack 
of 
practical 
training, 
no 
one 
could 
blame 
the 
practical 
workers. 
But 
the 
term 
"amateurishness" 
embraces 
something 
else: 
it 
denotes 
a 
narrow 
scope 
of 
revolutionary 
work 
generally, 
failure 
to 
understand 
that 
a 
good 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries 
cannot 
be 
built 
up 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
such 
narrow 
activity, 
and 
lastly 
--and 
most 
important 
--it 
denotes 
attempts 
to 
justify 
this 
narrowness 
and 
to 
elevate 
it 
to 
a 
special 
"theory," 
i.e., 
bowing 
in 
worship 
to 
spontaneity 
on 
this 
question 
too. 
Once 
such 
attempts 
were 
observed, 
it 
became 
certain 
that 
amateurishness 
is 
connected 
with 
Economism 
and 
that 
we 
shall 
never 
eliminate 
this 
narrowness 
of 
our 
organizational 
activity 
until 
we 
eliminate 
Economism 
generally 
(i.e., 
the 
narrow 
conception 
of 
Marxist 
theory, 
of 
the 
role 
of 
Social-Democracy 
and 
of 
its 
political 
tasks). 
And 
these 
attempts 
were 
revealed 
in 
a 
twofold 
direction. 
Some 
began 
to 
say: 
the 
mass 
of 
workers 
themselves 
have 
not 
yet 
advanced 
the 
broad 
and 
militant 
political 
tasks 
that 
the 
revolutionaries 
are 
attempting 
to 
"impose" 
upon 
them; 
they 
must 
continue, 
for 
the 
time 
being, 
to 
fight 
for 
immediate 
political 
demands, 
to 
conduct 
"the 
economic 
struggle 
against 
the 
employers 


and 
the 
government"[*] 
(and, 
naturally, 
corresponding 
to 
this 
struggle 
which 
is 
"easily 
understood" 
by 
the 
mass 
movement 
must 
be 
an 
organization 
that 
will 
be 
"easily 
understood" 
by 
the 
most 
untrained 
youth). 
Others, 
far 
removed 
from 
any 
kind 
of 
"gradualness," 
began 
to 
say: 
it 
is 
possible 
and 
necessary 
to 
"bring 
about 
a 
political 
revolution," 
but 
that 
does 
not 
require 
building 
a 
strong 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries 
to 
train 
the 
proletariat 
in 
the 
steadfast 
and 
stubborn 
struggle. 
All 
we 
need 
do 
is 
to 
snatch 
up 
our 
old 
friend, 
the 
"handy" 
wooden 
club. 
Speaking 
without 
metaphor 
it 
means 
--we 
must 
organize 
a 
general 
strike,[**] 
or 
we 
must 
stimulate 
the 
"spiritless" 
progress 
of 
the 
working-class 
movement 
by 
means 
of 
"excitative 
terror."*** 
Both 
these 



trends, 
the 
opportunists 
and 
the 
"revolutionists," 
bow 
to 
the 
prevailing 
amateurishness; 
neither 
believes 
that 
it 
can 
be 
eliminated, 
neither 
understands 
our 
primary 
and 
most 
imperative 
practical 
task, 
namely, 
to 
establish 
an 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries 
capable 
of 
maintaining 
the 
energy, 
stability 
and 
continuity 
of 
the 
political 
struggle. 


We 
have 
just 
quoted 
the 
words 
of 
B-v: 
"The 
growth 
of 
the 
working-
class 
movement 
is 
outstripping 
the 
growth 
and 
development 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
organizations." 
This 
"valuable 
remark 
of 
a 
close 
observer" 
(the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo's 
comment 
on 
B-v's 
article) 
has 
a 
twofold 
value 
for 
us. 
It 
shows 
that 
we 
were 
right 
in 
our 
opinion 
that 
the 
principal 
cause 
of 
the 
present 
crisis 
in 
Russian 
Social-Democracy 
is

that 
the 
leaders 
("ideologists," 
revolutionaries, 
Social-Democrats) 
lag 
behind 
the 
spontaneous 
upsurge 
of 
the 
masses. 
It 
shows 
that 
all 
the 
arguments 
advanced 
by 
the 
authors 
of 
the 
Economic 
letter 
(in 
the 
Iskra, 
No. 
12), 
by 
B. 
Krichevsky 
and 
by 
Martynov,

the 
danger 
of 
belittling 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
spontaneous 
element, 
about 
the 
drab 
everyday

about 
tactics-as-a-process, 
etc., 
are 
nothing 
more 
than 
a 
glorification 
and 
defence 
of 
amateurishness.

who 
describe

"sense

the 
realities 
of 
life," 
reveal 
in 
practice 
a 
failure 
to 
understand 
our 
most 
imperative 
practical 
tasks. 
To 
laggards 
they 
shout: 
Keep 
in 
step! 
Don't 
run 
ahead! 
To 
people 
suffering 
from 
a 
lack 
of 
energy 
and 
initiative 
in 
organizational 
work, 
from 
lack 
of 
"plans" 
for 
wide 
and 
bold 
activity, 
they 
shout 
about 
"tactics-as-a-process"! 
The 
principal 
sin 
we 
commit 
is 
that 
we 
degrade 
our 
political 
and 
organizational 
tasks 
to 
the 
level 
of 
the 
immediate, 
"palpable," 
"concrete" 
interests 
of 
the 
everyday 
economic 
struggle; 
and 
yet 
they 
keep 
singing 
to 
us 
the 
old 
song: 
lend 
the 
economic 
struggle 
itself 
a 
political 
character. 
We 
say 
again: 
this 
kind 
of 
thing 
displays 
as 
much 
"sense 
for 
the 
realities 
of 
life" 
as 
was 
displayed 
by 
the 
hero 
in 
the 
popular 
fable 
who 
shouted 
to 
a 
passing 
funeral 
procession: 
many 
happy 
returns

Recall 
the 
matchless, 
truly 
"Narcissus"[81]-like 
superciliousness 
with 
which 
these 
wiseacres 
lectured 
Plekhanov 
about 
the 
"workers' 
circles 
generally" 
(sic 
!) 
being 
"unable 
to 
cope 
with 
political 
tasks 
in 
the 
real 
and 
practical 
sense 
of 
the 
word, 
i.e., 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
expedient 
and 
successful 
practical 
struggle 
for 
political 
demands." 
(The 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo's 
Reply,

There 
are 
circles 
and 
circles, 
gentlemen! 
Circles 
of 
"amateurs" 
are, 
of 
course, 
not 
capable 
of 
coping 
with 
political 
tasks 
so 
long 
as 
they 
have 
not 
become 
aware 
of 
their 
amateurishness 
and 
do 
not 
abandon 
it. 
If, 
besides 
this, 
these 
amateurs 
are 
enamoured 
of 
their 
primitive 
methods, 
and 
insist 
on 
writing 
the 
word 
"practical" 
in 
italics, 
and 
imagine 
that 
being 
practical 
demands 
that 
one's 
tasks 
be 
reduced 
to 
the 
level 
of 
understanding 
of 
the 
most 
backward 
strata 
of 
the 
masses 
then 
they 
are 
hopeless, 
of 
course, 
and 
certainly 
cannot 
cope 
with 
any 
political 
tasks 
in 
general. 
But 
a 
circle 
of 
heroes 
like 
Alexeyev 
and 
Myshkin, 
Khalturin 
and 
Zhelyabov 
is 
capable 
of 
coping 
with 
political 
tasks 
in 
the 
genuine 
and 
most 
practical 
sense 
of 
the 
term, 
and 
it 
is 
capable 
of 
coping 
with 
them 
precisely 
because 
and 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
their 
passionate 
preaching 
meets 
with 
response 
among 
the 
spontaneously 
awakening 
masses, 
and 
their 
seething 
energy 
is 
answered 
and 
supported 
by 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
class. 
Plekhanov 
was 
a 
thousand 
times 
right 
when 
he 
not 
only 
pointed 
to 
this 
revolutionary 
class, 
not 
only 
proved 
that 
its 
spontaneous 
awakening 
was 
inevitable, 
and 
unavoidable, 
but 
also 
when 
he 
set 
even 
"workers' 
circles" 
a 
great 
and 
lofty 
political 
task. 
But 
you 
refer 
to 
the 
mass 
movement 
that 
has 
sprung 
up 
since 
that 
time 
in 
order 
to 
degrade 
this 
task, 
in 
order 
to 
narrow 
down 
the 
energy 
and 
scope 
of 
activity 
of 
the 
"workers' 
circles." 
If 
you 
are 
not 
amateurs 
enamoured 
of 
your 
primitive 
methods, 
what 
are 
you 
then? 
You 
boast 
that 
you 
are 
practical, 
but 
you 
fail 
to 
see 
what 
every 
Russian 
practical 
worker 
knows, 
namely, 
the 
miracles 
that 
the 
energy, 
not 
only 
of 
circles, 
but 
even 
of 
individual 
persons 
is 
able 
to 
perform 
in 
the 
revolutionary 
cause. 
Or 
do 
you 
think 
that 
our 
movement 
cannot 
produce 
heroes 
like 
those 
of 
the 
'seven


ties? 
But 
why? 
Because 
we 
lack 
training? 
But 
we 
are 
training 
ourselves, 
will 
go 
on 
training 
and 
acquire 
the 
training! 
Unfortunately 
it 
is 
true 
that 
mould 
has 
formed 
on 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
stagnant 
waters 
of 
the 
"economic 
struggle 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government"; 
people 
have 
appeared 
among 
us 
who 
kneel 
in 
prayer 
to 
spontaneity, 
gazing 
with 
awe 
(as 
Plekhanov 
expresses 
it) 
upon 
the 
"posteriors" 
of 
the 
Russian 
proletariat. 
But 
we 
will 
get 



rid 
of 
this 
mould. 
The 
time 
has 
come 
when 
Russian 
revolutionaries, 
guided 
by 
a 
genuinely 
revolutionary 
theory, 
relying 
upon 
the 
genuinely 
revolutionary 
and 
spontaneously 
awakening 
class, 
can 
at 
last 
--at 
last! 
--rise 
to 
full 
stature 
in 
all 
their 
giant 
strength. 
All 
that 
is 
required 
is 
that 
the 
masses 
of 
our 
practical 
workers, 
and 
the 
still 
larger 
masses 
of 
those 
who 
long 
for 
practical 
work 
even 
while 
still 
at 
school, 
shall 
meet 
with 
scorn 
and 
ridicule 
any 
suggestion 
that 
may 
be 
made 
to 
degrade 
our 
political 
tasks 
and 
to 
restrict 
the 
scope 
of 
our 
organizational 
work. 
And 
we 
shall 
achieve 
that, 
rest 
assured, 
gentlemen! 


In 
the 
article 
"Where 
To 
Begin?" 
I 
wrote 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo: 
"The 
tactics 
of 
agitation 
in 
relation 
to 
some 
special 
question, 
or 
the 
tactics 
with 
regard 
to 
some 
detail 
of 
party 
organization 
may 
be 
changed 
in 
twenty-four 
hours; 
but 
only 
people 
devoid 
of 
all 
principles 
are 
capable 
of 
changing 
in 
twenty-four 
hours, 
or 
twenty-four 
months 
for 
that 
matter, 
their 
views 
as 
to 
whether 
it 
is 
in 
general, 
always 
and 
absolutely, 
necessary 
to 
have 
a 
militant 
organization, 
and 
to 
conduct 
political 
agitation 
among 
the 
masses."[82] 
To 
this 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
replied: 
"This, 
the 
only 
one 
of 
the 
Iskra's 
charges 
that

on

is 
totally 
without

Readers 
of 
the 
Rabocheye

very 
well

right

the

without 
waiting 
for 
the

of

.

" 
(and 
saying 
at 
the 
same 
time 
that 
not 
only 
the 
workers' 
circles, 
"but 
also 
the 
mass 
working-
class 
movement 
could 
not 
regard 
as 
its 
primary 
political 
task 
the 
overthrow 
of 
absolutism," 
but 
only 
the 
struggle 
for 
immediate 
political 
demands, 
and 
that 
"the 
masses

to 
understand

political 
demands

one, 
or 
at 
all 
events, 
after

. 
. 
. 
"but 
the 
publications 
that 
we 
procured 
from 
abroad

only 
Social-Democratic

agitational 
material

. 
" 
(and 
in 
this 
only 
material, 
you 
not 
only 
based 
the 
widest 
political 
agitation 
exclusively 
on 
the 
economic 
struggle, 
but 
you 
even 
went 
to 
the 
extent 
of 
claiming 
that 
this 
narrowed-down 
agitation 
was 
the 
"most 
widely 
applicable." 
And 
do 
you 
not 
observe, 
gentlemen, 
that 
your 
own 
arguments 
prove 
the 
necessity 
--that 
kind 
of 
material 
being 
the 
only 
material 
provided 
--for 
the 
Iskra's 
appearance,

its

. 
."On 
the

the 
party" 
. 
. 
. 
(unity 
in 
the 
belief 
that 
tactics 
are 
a 
process 
of 
growth 
of 
Party

A 
precious 
unity 
indeed!)

"and 



by 
that

the 
creation

the

all 
that 
an 
organization 
abroad 
could 
do." 
(Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No.

p. 
15.) 
A 
vain 
attempt 
at 
evasion! 
I 
would 
never 
dream 
of 
denying 
that 
you 
did 
all 
you 
possibly 
could. 
I 
have 
asserted 
and 
assert 
now, 
that 
the 
limits 
of 
what 
is 
"possible" 
for 
you 
to 
do 
are 
restricted 
by 
the 
narrowness 
of 
your 
outlook. 
It 
is 
ridiculous 
even 
to 
talk 
about 
a 
"militant 
organization" 
to 
fight 
for 
"immediate 
political 
demands," 
or 
conduct 
"the 
economic 
struggle 
against 
the 
employers

the

But 
if 
the 
reader 
wishes 
to 
see 
the 
pearls 
of 
"Economist" 
passion 
for 
amateurishness, 
he 
must, 
of 
course, 
turn 
from 
the 
eclectic 
and 
vacillating 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
to 
the 
consistent 
and 
determined 
Rabochaya 
Mysl. 
In

Special 
Supplement,

"Now 
two 
words 
about 
the 
so-called

It 
is 
true 
that 
on 
more 
than 
one 
occasion 
it 
has 
proved 
that 
it 
was 
quite 
prepared 
to 
'enter

The 
unfortunate 
thing, 
however, 
is 
that, 
ruthlessly 
persecuted 
by 
the 
political 
police, 
our 
revolutionary 
intelligentsia 
imagined 
that 
the 
struggle 
against 
this 
political 
police 
was 
the 
political 
struggle 
against 
the 
autocracy. 
That 
is 
why, 
to 
this 
day, 
it 
cannot 
understand 
'where 
the

" 


What 
matchless 
and 
magnificent 
contempt 
for 
the

the 
police 
is 
displayed 
by 
this 
worshipper 
(in 
the 
worst 
sense 
of 
the 
word) 
of 
the 
spontaneous 
movement! 
Our 
inability 
to 
organize 
secretly 
he 
is 
prepared 
to 
justify 
by 
the 
argument 
that 
with 
the 
spontaneous 
growth 
of 
the 
mass 
movement, 
it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
important 
for 
us 
to 
hght 
against 
the 
political 
police!! 
Very 
few 
indeed 
would 
subscribe 
to 
this 
monstrous 
conclusion; 
our 
defects 
in 
revolutionary 
organization 
have 
become 
too 
urgent 
a 
matter 
to 
permit 
them 
to 
do 
that. 
But 
if 
Martynov, 
for 
example, 
refuses 
to 
subscribe 
to 
it, 
it 
will 
only 
be 
because 
he 
is 
unable, 
or 
lacks 
the 
courage, 
to 
think 
out 
his 
ideas 
to 
their 
logical 
conclusion. 
Indeed, 
does 
the 
"task" 
of 
prompting 
the 
masses 
to 
put 
forward 
concrete 
demands 
that 
promise 
palpable 
results 
call 
for 
special 
efforts 
to 
create 
a 
stable, 
centralized, 
militant 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries? 
Cannot 
such 
a 
"task" 
be 
carried 
out 
even 
by 
masses 
that 
do 
not 
"fight 
against 
the 
political 
police" 
at 


all? 
More: 
could 
this 
task 
be 
fulhlled 
unless, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
few 
leaders, 
it 
was 
undertaken 
by 
such 
workers 
(the 
overwhelming 
majority), 
who 
are 
quite 
incapable 
of 
"fighting 
against 
the 
political 
police"? 
Such 
workers, 
average 
people 
of 
the 
masses, 
are 
capable 
of 
displaying 
enormous 



energy 
and 
self-sacrifice 
in 
strikes 
and 
in 
street 
battles 
with 
the 
police 
and 
troops, 
and 
are 
capable 
(in 
fact, 
are 
alone 
capable) 
of 
determining 
the 
outcome 
of 
our 
entire 
movement 
--but 
the 
struggle 
against 
the 
political 
police 
requires 
special 
qualities; 
it 
requires 
professional 
revolutionaries. 
And 
we 
must 
not 
only 
see 
to 
it 
that 
the 
masses 
"advance" 
concrete 
demands, 
but 
also 
that 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers 
"advance" 
an 
increasing 
number 
of 
such 
professional 
revolutionaries. 
Thus 
we 
have 
reached 
the 
question 
of 
the 
relation 
between 
an 
organization 
of 
professional 
revolutionaries 
and 
the 
pure 
and 
simple 
working-class 
movement. 
Although 
this 
question 
has 
found 
little 
reflection 
in 
literature, 
it 
has 
greatly 
engaged 
us 
"politicians" 
in 
conversations 
and 
controversies 
with 
those 
comrades 
who 
gravitate 
more 
or 
less 
towards 
Economism. 
It 
is 
a 
question 
that 
deserves 
special 
treatment. 
But 
before 
taking 
it 
up 
let 
us 
cite 
one 
more 
quotation 
by 
way 
of 
illustrating 
our 
thesis 
concerning 
the 
connection 
between 
amateurishness 
and 
Economism. 


In 
his 
Reply, 
Mr. 
N. 
N.[83] 
wrote: 
"The 
Emancipation 
of

Emphasizing 
the 
last 
words, 
the 
author 
adds 
the 
following 
footnote 
to 
the 
word 
"path": 
"This 
can 
not 
be 
explained 
by 
purposes 
of 
secrecy, 
because 
the 
program 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
a 
plot 
but 
to 
a 
mass 
movement. 
And 
the 


masses 
cannot 
proceed 
by 
secret 
paths. 
Can 
we 
conceive

a 
secret 
strike? 
Can 
we 
conceive 
of 
secret 
demonstrations 
and 
petitions?" 
(Vademecum, 
p. 
59.) 
Thus, 
the 
author 
approaches 
quite 
closely 
to 
the 
question 
of 
the 
"material 
forces" 
(organizers 
of 
strikes 
and 
demonstrations) 
and 
to 
the 
"paths" 
of 
the 
struggle, 
but, 
nevertheless, 
is 
still 
in 
a 
state 
of 
consternation, 
because 
he 
"worships" 
the 
mass 
movement, 
i.e., 
he 
regards 
it 
as 
something 
that 
relieves 
us 
of 
the 
necessity 
of 
conducting 
revolutionary 
activity 
and 
not 
as 
something 
that 
should 
encourage 
us 
and 
stimulate 
our 
revolutionary 
activity. 
A 
secret 
strike 
is 
impossible 
--for 
those 
who 
take 
part 
in 
it 
and 
for 
those 
immediately 
associated 
with 
it, 
but 
a 
strike 
may 
remain 
(and 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
cases 
does 
remain) 
a 
"secret" 
to 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
Russian 
workers, 
because 
the 
government 
takes 
care 
to 
cut 
all 
communication 
between 
strikers, 
takes 
care 
to 
prevent 
all 
news 
of 
strikes 
from 
spreading. 
Here 
indeed 
is 
where 
a 
special 
"fight 
against 
the 
political 
police" 
is 
required, 
a 
fight 
that 
can 
never 
be 
conducted 
by 
such 
large 
masses 



as 
take 
part 
in 
strikes. 
This 
struggle 
must 
be 
organized, 
according 
to 
"all 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
art," 
by 
people 
who 
are 
professionally 
engaged 
in 
revolutionary 
activity. 
The 
fact 
that 
the 
masses 
are 
spontaneously 
being 
drawn 
into 
the 
movement 
does 
not 
make 
the 
organization 
of 
this 
struggle 
less 
necessary. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
it 
makes 
it 
more 
necessary; 
for 
we 
Socialists 
would 
be 
failing 
in 
our 
direct 
duty 
to 
the 
masses 
if 
we 
did 
not 
prevent 
the 
police 
from 
making 
a 
secret 
of 
(and 
if 
we 
did 
not 
ourselves 
sometimes 
secretly 
prepare) 
every 
strike 
and 
every 
demonstration. 
And 
we 
shall 
succeed 
in 
doing 
this, 
precisely 
because 
the 
spontaneously 
awakening 
masses 
will 
advance 
also 
from 
their 
own 
ranks 
increasing 
numbers 
of 
"professional 
revolution 


aries" 
(that 
is, 
if 
we 
do 
not 
take 
it 
into 
our 
heads 
to 
advise 
the 
workers 
to 
keep 
on 
marking 
time). 



C. 
ORGANIZATION 
OF 
WORKERS 
AND 
ORGANIZATION 
OF 
REVOLUTIONARIES 
It 
is 
only 
natural 
to 
expect 
that 
a 
Social-Democrat, 
who 
conceives 
the 
political 
struggle 
as 
being 
identical 
with 
the 
"economic 
struggle 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government," 
should 
conceive 
of 
an 
"organization 
of 
revolutionaries" 
as 
being 
more 
or 
less 
identical 
with 
an 
"organization 
of 
workers." 
And 
this, 
in 
fact, 
is 
what 
actually 
happens; 
so 
that 
when 
we 
talk 
about 
organization, 
we 
literally 
talk 
in 
different 
tongues. 
I 
vividly 
recall, 
for 
example, 
a 
conversation 
I 
once 
had 
with 
a 
fairly 
consistent 
Economist, 
with 
whom 
I 
had 
not 
been 
previously 
acquainted. 
We 
were 
discussing 
the 
pamphlet 
Who 
Will 
Bring 
About 
the 
Political 
Revolution? 
and 
we 
were 
very 
soon 
agreed 
that 
its 
principal 
defect 
was 
that 
it 
ignored 
the 
question 
of 
organization. 
We 
were 
beginning 
to 
think 
that 
we 
were 
in 
complete 
agreement 
with 
each 
other 
--but 
. 
. 
. 
as 
the 
conversation 
proceeded, 
it 
became 
clear 
that 
we 
were 
talking 
of 
different 
things. 
My 
interlocutor 
accused 
the 
author 
of 
ignoring 
strike 
funds, 
mutual 
aid 
societies, 
etc., 
whereas 
I 
had 
in 
mind 
an 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries 
as 
an 
essential 
factor 
in 
"bringing 
about" 
the 
political 
revolution. 
As 
soon 
as 
that 
disagreement 
became 
clear, 
I 
hardly 
remember 
a 
single 
question 
of 
principle 
upon 
which 
I 
was 
in 
agreement 
with 
that 
Economist! 
What 
was 
the 
source 
of 
our 
disagreement? 
It 
was 
the 
fact 
that 
on 
questions 
of 
both 
organization 
and 
politics 
the 


Economists 
are 
forever 
lapsing 
from 
Social-Democracy 
into 
trade 
unionism. 
The 
political 
struggle 
of 
Social-Democracy 
is 
far 
more 
extensive 
and 
complex 
than 
the 
economic 
struggle 
of 
the 
workers 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government. 
Similarly 
(and 
indeed 
for 
that 
reason), 
the 
organization 
of 
a 
revolutionary 
Social-Democratic 
party 
must 
inevitably 
be 
of 
a 
different 
kind 
than 
the 
organizations 
of 
the 
workers 
designed 
for 
this 
struggle. 
A 
workers' 
organization 
must 
in 
the 
first 
place 
be 
a 
trade 
organization; 
secondly, 
it 
must 
be 
as 
broad 
as 
possible; 
and 
thirdly, 
it 
must 
be 
as 
little 
clandestine 
as 
possible 
(here, 
and 
further 
on, 
of 
course, 
I 
have 
only 
autocratic 
Russia 
in 
mind). 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
organizations 
of 
revolutionaries 
must 
consist 
first, 
foremost 
and 
mainly 
of 
people 
who 
make 
revolutionary 
activity 
their 
profession 
(that 
is 
why 
I 
speak 
of 
organizations 
of 
revolutionaries, 
meaning 
revolutionary 
Social-Democrats). 
In 
view 
of 
this 
common 
feature 
of 
the 
members 
of 
such 
an 
organization, 
all 
distinctions 
as 
between 
workers 
and 
intellectuals, 
and 
certainly 
distinctions 
of 
trade 
and 
profession, 
must 



be 
utterly 
obliterated. 
Such 
an 
organization 
must 
of 
necessity 
be 
not 
too 
extensive 
and 
as 
secret 
as 
possible. 
Let 
us 
examine 
this 
threefold 
distinction. 


In 
countries 
where 
political 
liberty 
exists 
the 
distinction 
between 
a 
trade 
union 
and 
a 
political 
organization 
is 
clear 
enough, 
as 
is 
the 
distinction 
between 
trade 
unions 
and 
Social-Democracy. 
The 
relation 
of 
the 
latter 
to 
the 
former 
will 
naturally 
vary 
in 
each 
country 
according 
to 
historical, 
legal 
and 
other 
conditions 
--it 
may 
be 
more 
or 
less 
close, 
complex, 
etc. 
(in 
our 
opinion 
it 
should 
be 
as 
close 
and 
simple 
as 
possible); 
but 
there 
can 
be 
no 
question 
of 
trade 
union 
organizations 
being 
identical 
with 
the 
Social-Democratic 
party 


organizations 
in 
free 
countries. 
In 
Russia, 
however, 
the 
yoke 
of 
the 
autocracy 
appears 
at 
first 
glance 
to 
obliterate 
all 
distinctions 
between 
a 
Social-Democratic 
organization 
and 
trade 
unions, 
because 
all 
workers' 
associations 
and 
all 
circles 
are 
prohibited, 
and 
because 
the 
principal 
manifestation 
and 
weapon 
of 
the 
workers' 
economic 
struggle 
--the 
strike 
--is 
regarded 
as 
a 
criminal 
(and 
sometimes 
even 
as 
a 
political!) 
offence. 
Conditions 
in 
our 
country, 
therefore, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
strongly 
"impel" 
the 
workers 
engaged 
in 
economic 
struggle 
to 
concern 
themselves 
with 
political 
questions, 
and, 
on 
the 
other, 
they 
"impel" 
Social-Democrats 
to 
confuse 
trade 
unionism 
with 
Social-Democracy 
(and 
our 
Krichevskys, 
Martynovs 
and 
their 
like, 
while 
diligently 
discussing 
the 
first 
kind 
of 
"impelling," 
fail 
to 
notice 
the 
second 
kind). 
Indeed, 
picture 
to 
yourselves 
people 
who 
are 
immersed 
ninety-
nine 
per 
cent 
in 
"the 
economic 
struggle 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government." 
Some 
of 
them 
will 
never, 
during 
the 
whole 
course 
of 
their 
activity 
(four 
to 
six 
months) 
be 
impelled 
to 
think 
of 
the 
need 
for 
a 
more 
complex 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries; 
others, 
perhaps, 
will 
come 
across 
the 
fairly 
widely 
distributed 
Bernsteinian 
literature, 
from 
which 
they 
will 
become 
convinced 
of 
the 
profound 
importance 
of 
the 
forward 
march 
of 
"the 
drab 
everyday 
struggle." 
Still 
others 
will 
be 
carried 
away, 
perhaps, 
by 
the 
seductive 
idea 
of 
showing 
the 
world 
a 
new 
example 
of 
"close 
and 
organic 
contact 
with 
the 
proletarian 
struggle" 
--contact 
between 
the 
trade 
union 
and 
Social-Democratic 
movements. 
Such 
people 
may 
argue 
that 
the 
later 
a 
country 
enters 
into 
the 
arena 
of 
capitalism 
and, 
consequently, 
of 
the 
working-
class 
movement, 
the 
more 
the 
Socialists 
in 
that 
country 
may 
take 
part 
in, 
and 
support, 
the 
trade 
union 
movement, 
and 
the 
less 
reason 
can 


and 
should 
there 
be 
for 
non-Social-Democratic 
trade 
unions. 
Up 
to 
this 
point 
the 
argument 
is 
quite 
correct; 
unfortunately, 
however, 
some 
go 
beyond 
that 
and 
envisage 
the 
complete 
fusion 
of 
Social-Democracy 
with 
trade 



unionism. 
We 
shall 
soon 
see, 
from 
the 
example 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
the 
St. 
Petersburg 
League 
of 
Struggle, 
what 
a 
harmful 
effect 
these 
dreams 
have 
upon 
our 
plans 
of 
organization. 


The 
workers' 
organizations 
for 
the 
economic 
struggle 
should 
be 
trade 
union 
organizations. 
Every 
Social-Democratic 
worker 
should 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
assist 
and 
actively 
work 
in 
these 
organizations. 
That 
is 
true. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
to 
our 
interest 
to 
demand 
that 
only 
Social-Democrats 
should 
be 
eligible 
for 
membership 
in 
the 
"trade" 
unions: 
that 
would 
only 
narrow 
down 
our 
influence 
over 
the 
masses. 
Let 
every 
worker 
who 
understands 
the 
need 
to 
unite 
for 
the 
struggle 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government 
join 
the 
trade 
unions. 
The 
very 
aim 
of 
the 
trade 
unions 
would 
be 
unattainable 
if 
they 
failed 
to 
unite 
all 
who 
have 
attained 
at 
least 
this 
elementary 
degree 
of 
understanding, 
and 
if 
they 
were 
not 
very 
wide 
organizations. 
And 
the 
wider 
these 
organizations 
are, 
the 
wider 
our 
influence 
over 
them 
will 
be 
--an 
influence 
due 
not 
only 
to 
the 
"spontaneous" 
development 
of 
the 
economic 
struggle 
but 
also 
to 
the 
direct 
and 
conscious 
effort 
of 
the 
socialist 
trade 
union 
members 
to 
influence 
their 
comrades. 
But 
a 
broad 
organization 
cannot 
apply 
the 
methods 
of 
strict 
secrecy 
(since 
the 
latter 
demands 
far 
greater 
training 
than 
is 
required 
for 
the 
economic 
struggle). 
How 
is 
the 
contradiction 
between 
the 
need 
for 
a 
large 
membership 
and 
the 
need 
for 
strictly 
secret 
methods 
to 
be 
reconciled? 
How 
are 
we 
to 
make 
the 
trade 
unions 
as 
little 
clandestine 
as 
possible? 
Generally 
speaking, 
there 
can 
be 
only 
two 
ways 
to 
this 
end: 


either 
the 
trade 
unions 
become 
legalized 
(and 
in 
some 
countries 
this 
preceded 
the 
legalization 
of 
the 
Socialist 
and 
political 
unions), 
or 
the 
organization 
is 
kept 
a 
secret 
one, 
but 
so 
"free" 
and 
amorphous, 
lose[84] 
as 
the 
Germans 
say, 
that 
the 
need 
for 
secret 
methods 
becomes 
almost 
negligible 
as 
far 
as 
the 
bulk 
of 
the 
members 
is 
concerned. 


The 
legalization 
of 
the 
non-socialist 
and 
non-political 
labour 
unions 
in 
Russia 
has 
already 
begun, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
every 
advance 
made 
by 
our 
rapidly 
growing 
Social-Democratic 
working-class 
movement 
will 
multiply 
and 
encourage 
attempts 
at 
legalization 
--attempts 
proceeding 
for 
the 
most 
part 
from 
supporters 
of 
the 
existing 
order, 
but 
partly 
also 
from 
the 
workers 
themselves 
and 
from 
liberal 
intellectuals. 
The 
banner 
of 
legality 
has 
already 
been 
hoisted 
by 
the 
Vasilyevs 
and 
the 
Zubatovs. 
Support 
has 
been 
promised 
by 
Messrs. 
the 
Ozerovs 
and 
the 
Wormses, 
and 
followers 
of 
the 
new 
tendency 
are 
already 
to 
be 
found 
among 
the 
workers. 
Henceforth, 
we 
cannot 
but 
reckon 
with 
this 
tendency. 
As 
to 
how 
we 
are 
to 
reckon 
with 
it, 
there 
can 



be 
no 
two 
opinions 
among 
Social-Democrats. 
We 
must 
steadfastly 
expose 
any 
part 
played 
in 
this 
movement 
by 
the 
Zubatovs 
and 
the 
Vasilyevs, 
the 
gendarmes 
and 
the 
priests, 
and 
explain 
to 
the 
workers 
what 
their 
real 
intentions 
are. 
We 
must 
also 
expose 
all 
the 
conciliatory, 
"harmonious" 
notes 
that 
will 
be 
heard 
in 
the 
speeches 
of 
liberal 
politicians 
at 
the 
legal 
meetings 
of 
the 
workers, 
irrespective 
of 
whether 
these 
speeches 
are 
motivated 
by 
an 
earnest 
conviction 
of 
the 
desirability 
of 
peaceful 
class 
collaboration, 
by 
a 
desire 
to 
curry 
favour 
with 
the 
powers 
that 
be, 
or 
are 
simply 
the 
result 
of 
clumsiness. 
Lastly, 
we 
must 
warn 
the 
workers 
against 
the 
traps 
often 
set 
by 
the 
police, 
who 
at 
such 
open 
meetings 
and 
permitted 
societies 
spy 


out 
the 
"hotheads" 
and 
try 
to 
make 
use 
of 
legal 
organizations 
to 
plant 
their 
agents 
provocateurs 
in 
the 
illegal 
organizations. 


But 
while 
doing 
all 
this, 
we 
must 
not 
forget 
that 
in 
the 
long 
run 
the 
legalization 
of 
the 
working-class 
movement 
will 
be 
to 
our 
advantage, 
and 
not 
to 
that 
of 
the 
Zubatovs. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
it 
is 
precisely 
our 
campaign 
of 
exposure 
that 
will 
help 
us 
to 
separate 
the 
tares 
from 
the 
wheat. 
What 
the 
tares 
are, 
we 
have 
already 
indicated. 
By 
the 
wheat, 
we 
mean 
that 
the 
attention 
of 
still 
larger 
and 
more 
backward 
sections 
of 
the 
workers 
is 
attracted 
to 
social 
and 
political 
questions; 
we 
mean 
relieving 
us, 
revolutionaries, 
of 
functions 
which 
are 
essentially 
legal 
(the 
distribution 
of 
legal 
books, 
mutual 
aid, 
etc.), 
and 
the 
development 
of 
which 
will 
inevitably 
provide 
us 
with 
an 
increasing 
quantity 
of 
material 
for 
agitation. 
In 
this 
sense, 
we 
may, 
and 
should 
say, 
to 
the 
Zubatovs 
and 
the 
Ozerovs: 
keep 
at 
it, 
gentlemen, 
do 
your 
best! 
Whenever 
you 
place 
a 
trap 
in 
the 
path 
of 
the 
workers 
(either 
by 
way 
of 
direct 
provocation, 
or 
by 
the 
"honest" 
corruption 
of 
the 
workers 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
"Struve-ism"), 
we 
shall 
see 
to 
it 
that 
you 
are 
exposed. 
But 
whenever 
you 
take 
a 
real 
step 
forward, 
even 
if 
it 
is 
the 
most 
"timid 
zigzag," 
we 
shall 
say: 
please 
continue! 
And 
the 
only 
step 
that 
can 
be 
a 
real 
step 
forward 
is 
a 
real, 
if 
small, 
extension 
of 
the 
workers' 
field 
of 
action. 
And 
every 
such 
extension 
will 
be 
to 
our 
advantage 
and 
will 
help 
to 
hasten 
the 
advent 
of 
legal 
societies 
of 
the 
kind 
where 
not 
agents 
provocateurs 
will 
detect 
Socialists, 
but 
where 
Socialists 
will 
find 
adherents. 
In 
a 
word, 
our 
task 
is 
to 
fight 
down 
the 
tares. 
It 
is 
not 
our 
business 
to 
grow 
wheat 
in 
flower 
pots. 
By 
pulling 
up 
the 
tares, 
we 
clear 
the 
soil 
for 
the 
wheat. 
And 
while 
the 
Afanasi 
Ivanoviches 
and 
Pulkheria 
Ivanovnas[85] 
are 
tending 
their 
flower-pot 
crops, 
we 
must 
prepare 
the 
reapers, 
not 
only 


to 
cut 
down 
the 
tares 
of 
today, 
but 
also 
to 
reap 
the 
wheat 
of 
tomorrow.[*] 



Thus, 
we 
cannot 
by 
means 
of 
legalization 
solve 
the 
problem 
of 
creating 
a 
trade 
union 
organization 
that 
will 
be 
as 
little 
secret 
and 
as 
extensive 
as 
possible 
(but 
we 
would 
be 
extremely 
glad 
if 
the 
Zubatovs 
and 
the 
Ozerovs 
provided 
us 
with 
even 
a 
partial 
opportunity 
for 
such 
a 
solution 
--to 
which 
end 
we 
must 
fight 
them 
as 
strenuously 
as 
possible!). 
There 
remains 
the 
path 
of 
secret 
trade 
union 
organization; 
and 
we 
must 
give 
all 
possible 
assistance 
to 
the 
workers, 
who 
(as 
we 
definitely 
know) 
are 
already 
adopting 
this 
path. 
Trade 
union 
organizations 
can 
be 
not 
only 
of 
tremendous 
value 
in 
developing 
and 
consolidating 
the 
economic 
struggle, 
but 
can 
also 
become 
a 
very 
important 
auxiliary 
to 
political 
agitation 
and 
revolutionary 
organization. 
In 
order 
to 
achieve 
this, 
and 
in 
order 
to 
guide 
the 
nascent 
trade 
union 
movement 
in 
the 
channels 
the 
Social-Democrats 
desire, 
we 
must 
first 
of 
all 
clearly 
realize 
how 
absurd 
is 
the 
plan 
of 
organization 
with 
which 
the 
St. 
Petersburg 
Economists 
have 
been 
occupying 
themselves 
for 
nearly 
five 
years. 
That 
plan 
is 
set 
forth 
in 
the 
"Rules 
for 
a 
Workers' 
Benefit 
Fund" 
of 
July 
1897 
(Listok 
Rabotnika, 
No. 
9-10, 
p. 
46; 
taken 
from 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl, 
No. 
1), 
and 
also 


* 
The 
Iskra's 
campaign 
against 
the 
tares 
evoked 
the 
following 
angry 
outburst 
from 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
: 
"For 
the 
Iskra, 
the 
signs 
of 
the 
times 
lie 
not 
so 
much 
in 
the 
great 
events 
(of 
the 
spring), 
as 
in 
the 
miserable 
attempt 
of 
the 
agents 
of 
Zubatov 
to 
'legalize' 
the 
working-class 
movement. 
It 
fails 
to 
see 
that 
these 
facts 
tell 
against 
it; 
for 
they 
testify 
that 
the 
working-class 
movement 
has 
assumed 
menacing 
proportions 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
government." 
(Two 
Congresses, 
p. 
27.) 
For 
all 
this 
we 
have 
to 
blame 
the 
"dogmatism" 
of 
those 
orthodox 
fellows 
who 
"ignore 
the 
imperative 
demands 
of 
life." 
They 
obstinately 
refuse 
to 
see 
the 
yard-high 
wheat 
and 
are 
fighting 
down 
the 
inch-high 
tares! 
Does 
this 
not 
reveal 
a 
"distorted 
sense 
of 
perspective 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
Russian 
working 
class 
movement"? 
(Ibid., 
p. 
27.) 
in 
the 
"Rules 
for 
a 
Trade 
Union 
Workers' 
Organization," 
of 
October 
1900 
(special 
leaflet 
printed 
in 
St. 
Petersburg 
and 
quoted 
in 
the 
Iskra, 
No. 
1). 
The 
fundamental 
defect 
of 
both 
these 
sets 
of 
rules 
is 
that 
they 
give 
a 
detailed 
formulation 
of 
a 
broad 
workers' 
organization 
and 
confuse 
it 
with 
an 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries. 
Let 
us 
take 
the 
last-mentioned 
set 
of 
rules, 
since 
it 
is 
drawn 
up 
in 
greater 
detail. 
The 
body 
of 
it 
consists 
of 
fifty-
two 
paragraphs. 
Twenty-three 
paragraphs 
deal 
with 
structure, 
the 
method 
of 
conducting 
business 
and 
the 
jurisdiction 
of 
the 
"workers' 
circles," 
which 
are 
to 
be 
organized 
in 
every 
factory 
("not 
more 
than 
ten 
persons") 
and 
which 
elect 
"central 
(factory) 
groups." 
"The 
central 
group," 
says 
paragraph 
2, 



"observes 
all 
that 
goes 
on 
in 
its 
factory 
or 
workshop 
and 
keeps 
a 
record 
of 
events." 
"The 
central 
group 
presents 
to 
subscribers 
a 
monthly 
financial 
account" 
(par. 
17), 
etc. 
Ten 
paragraphs 
are 
devoted 
to 
the 
"district 
organization," 
and 
nineteen 
to 
the 
highly 
complex 
interconnection 
between 
the 
"Committee 
of 
the 
Workers' 
Organization" 
and 
the 
"Committee 
of 
the 
St. 
Petersburg 
League 
of 
Struggle" 
(delegates 
from 
each 
district 
and 
from 
the 
"executive 
groups" 
--"groups 
of 
propagandists, 
groups 
for 
maintaining 
contact 
with 
the 
provinces 
and 
with 
the 
organization 
abroad, 
groups 
for 
managing 
stores, 
publications 
and 
funds"). 


Social-Democracy= 
"executive 
groups" 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
economic 
struggle 
of 
the 
workers! 
It 
would 
be 
difficult 
to 
find 
a 
more 
striking 
illustration 
of 
how 
the 
Economists' 
ideas 
deviate 
from 
Social-Democracy 
to 
trade 
unionism, 
and 
how 
alien 
to 
them 
is 
any 
idea 
that 
a 
Social-Democrat 
must 
concern 
himself 
first 
and 
foremost 
with 
an 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries 
who 
are 
capable 
of 
guiding 
the 
whole 
proletarian 
struggle 
for 
emancipation. 
To 
talk 
of 
"the 
political 
emancipation 
of 
the 
working 
class" 
and 
of 
the 
struggle 
against 
"tsarist 


despotism," 
and 
yet 
to 
draft 
rules 
like 
this, 
indicates 
a 
complete 
failure 
to 
understand 
what 
the 
real 
political 
tasks 
of 
Social-Democracy 
are. 
Not 
one 
of 
the 
fifty 
or 
so 
paragraphs 
reveals 
the 
slightest 
glimmer 
of 
understanding 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
conduct 
the 
widest 
possible 
political 
agitation 
among 
the 
masses, 
an 
agitation 
that 
deals 
with 
every 
aspect 
of 
Russian 
absolutism 
and 
with 
all 
the 
features 
of 
the 
various 
social 
classes 
in 
Russia. 
Rules 
like 
these 
are 
of 
no 
use 
even 
for 
the 
achievement 
of 
trade 
union 
aims, 
let 
alone 
political 
aims, 
for 
that 
requires 
organization 
according 
to 
trades, 
of 
which 
no 
mention 
is 
made 
in 
the 
Rules. 


But 
most 
characteristic 
of 
all, 
perhaps, 
is 
the 
amazing 
top-heaviness 
of 
the 
whole 
"system," 
which 
attempts 
to 
bind 
each 
single 
factory 
with 
the 
"committee" 
by 
a 
permanent 
string 
of 
uniform 
and 
ludicrously 
petty 
rules 
and 
a 
three-stage 
system 
of 
election. 
Hemmed 
in 
by 
the 
narrow 
outlook 
of 
Economism, 
the 
mind 
is 
lost 
in 
details 
which 
positively 
reek 
of 
red 
tape 
and 
bureaucracy. 
In 
practice, 
of 
course, 
three-fourths 
of 
the 
clauses 
are 
never 
applied; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
however, 
a 
"conspiratorial" 
organization 
of 
this 
kind, 
with 
its 
central 
group 
in 
each 
factory, 
makes 
it 
very 
easy 
for 
the 
gendarmes 
to 
carry 
out 
raids 
on 
a 
vast 
scale. 
The 
Polish 
comrades 
have 
already 
passed 
through 
a 
similar 
phase 
in 
their 
movement, 
when 
everybody 
was 
enthusiastic 
about 
the 
extensive 
organization 
of 
workers' 
benefit 
funds; 



but 
they 
very 
quickly 
abandoned 
this 
idea 
when 
they 
saw 
that 
such 
organizations 
only 
provided 
rich 
harvests 
for 
the 
gendarmes. 
If 
we 
are 
out 
for 
wide 
workers' 
organizations, 
and 
not 
for 
widespread 
arrests, 
if 
we 
do 
not 
want 
to 
provide 
satisfaction 
to 
the 
gendarmes, 
we 
must 
aim 
to 
have 
these 
organizations 
remain 
entirely 
informal. 
But 
will 
they 
be 
able 
to 
function 
in 
that 
case? 
Well, 
let 
us 
see 
what 
the 
functions 
are: 
". 
. 
. 
to 
observe 
all 
that 
goes 
on 
in 
the 


factory 
and 
keep 
a 
record 
of 
events." 
(Par. 
2 
of 
the 
Rules.) 
Do 
we 
really 
require 
a 
formal 
group 
for 
this? 
Could 
not 
the 
purpose 
be 
better 
served 
by 
correspondence 
to 
the 
illegal 
papers 
and 
without 
setting 
up 
special 
groups? 
". 
. 
. 
To 
lead 
the 
struggles 
of 
the 
workers 
for 
the 
improvement 
of 
their 
workshop 
conditions." 
(Par. 
3 
of 
the 
Rules.) 
This, 
too, 
requires 
no 
formal 
group. 
Any 
sensible 
agitator 
can 
establish 
just 
what 
demands 
the 
workers 
want 
to 
advance 
in 
the 
course 
of 
ordinary 
conversation 
and 
transmit 
them 
to 
a 
narrow 
--not 
a 
wide 
--organization 
of 
revolutionaries 
to 
be 
embodied 
in 
a 
leaflet. 
". 
. 
. 
To 
organize 
a 
fund 
. 
. 
. 
to 
which 
subscriptions 
of 
two 
kopeks 
per 
ruble 
should 
be 
made" 
(par. 
9) 
. 
. 
. 
to 
present 
to 
subscribers 
a 
monthly 
financial 
account 
(par. 
17) 
. 
. 
. 
to 
expel 
members 
who 
fail 
to 
pay 
dues 
(par. 
10), 
and 
so 
forth. 
Why, 
this 
is 
a 
very 
paradise 
for 
the 
police; 
for 
nothing 
would 
be 
easier 
than 
for 
them 
to 
penetrate 
into 
the 
ponderous 
secrecy 
of 
a 
"central 
factory 
fund," 
confiscate 
the 
money 
and 
arrest 
all 
the 
best 
people. 
Would 
it 
not 
be 
simpler 
to 
issue 
one-kopek 
or 
two-kopek 
coupons 
bearing 
the 
official 
stamp 
of 
a 
well-known 
(very 
exclusive 
and 
very 
secret) 
organization, 
or 
to 
make 
collections 
without 
coupons 
of 
any 
kind 
and 
to 
print 
reports 
in 
a 
certain 
agreed 
code 
in 
an 
illegal 
paper? 
The 
object 
would 
thereby 
be 
attained, 
but 
it 
would 
be 
a 
hundred 
times 
more 
difficult 
for 
the 
gendarmes 
to 
pick 
up 
clues. 


I 
could 
go 
on 
analyzing 
the 
Rules, 
but 
I 
think 
that 
what 
has 
been 
said 
will 
suffice. 
A 
small, 
compact 
core 
of 
the 
most 
reliable, 
experienced 
and 
hardened 
workers, 
with 
responsible 
representatives 
in 
the 
principal 
districts 
and 
connected 
by 
all 
the 
rules 
of 
strict 
secrecy 
with 
the 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries, 
can, 
with 
the 
widest 
support 
of 
the 
masses 
and 
without 
any 
formal 
organization, 
perform 
all 
the 
functions 
of 


a 
trade 
union 
organization, 
and 
perform 
them, 
moreover, 
in 
a 
manner 
desirable 
to 
Social-Democracy. 
Only 
in 
this 
way 
can 
we 
secure 
the 
consolidation 
and 
development 
of 
a 
Social-Democratic 
trade 
union 
movement, 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
the 
gendarmes. 



It 
may 
be 
objected 
that 
an 
organization 
which 
is 
so 
loose 
that 
it 
is 
not 
even 
definitely 
formed, 
and 
which 
even 
has 
no 
enrolled 
and 
registered 
membership, 
cannot 
be 
called 
an 
organization 
at 
all. 
That 
may 
very 
well 
be. 
I 
am 
not 
out 
for 
names. 
But 
this 
"organization 
without 
members" 
will 
do 
everything 
that 
is 
required, 
and 
from 
the 
very 
outset 
guarantee 
the 
closest 
contact 
between 
our 
future 
trade 
unions 
and 
Socialism. 
Only 
an 
incorrigible 
utopian 
would 
want 
a 
broad 
organization 
of 
workers, 
with 
elections, 
reports, 
universal 
suffrage, 
etc., 
under 
the 
autocracy. 


The 
moral 
to 
be 
drawn 
from 
this 
is 
a 
simple 
one: 
if 
we 
begin 
with 
the 
solid 
foundation 
of 
a 
strong 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries, 
we 
can 
guarantee 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
movement 
as 
a 
whole 
and 
carry 
out 
the 
aims 
of 
both 
Social-Democracy 
and 
of 
trade 
unions 
proper. 
If, 
however, 
we 
begin 
with 
a 
broad 
workers' 
organization, 
supposed 
to 
be 
most 
"accessible" 
to 
the 
masses 
(but 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
most 
accessible 
to 
the 
gendarmes 
and 
making 
the 
revolutionaries 
most 
accessible 
to 
the 
police), 
we 
shall 
achieve 
neither 
one 
nor 
the 
other 
of 
these 
aims; 
we 
shall 
not 
eliminate 
our 
amateurishness, 
and 
because 
we 
remain 
scattered 
and 
our 
forces 
are 
constantly 
broken 
up 
by 
the 
police, 
we 
shall 
only 
make 
the 
trade 
unions 
of 
the 
Zubatov 
and 
Ozerov 
type 
most 
accessible 
to 
the 
masses. 


What, 
properly 
speaking, 
should 
be 
the 
functions 
of 
an 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries? 
We 
shall 
deal 
with 
this 
in 
detail. 
But 
first 
let 
us 
examine 
a 
very 
typical 
argument 
advanced 
by 
our 
terrorist, 
who 
(sad 
fate!) 
in 
this 
matter 
also 
is 
a 
next-

door 
neighbour 
to 
the 
Economist. 
The 
Svoboda 
(No. 
1), 
a 
journal 
published 
for 
workers, 
contains 
an 
article 
entitled 
"Organization," 
the 
author 
of 
which 
tries 
to 
defend 
his 
friends, 
the 
Economist 
workers 
of 
Ivanovo-
Voznesensk. 
He 
writes: 


"It 
is 
a 
bad 
thing 
when 
the 
crowd 
is 
mute 
and 
unenlightened, 
and 
when 
the 
movement 
does 
not 
proceed 
from 
the 
rank 
and 
file. 
For 
instance, 
the 
students 
of 
a 
university 
town 
leave 
for 
their 
homes 
during 
the 
summer 
and 
other 
vacations 
and 
immediately 
the 
workers' 
movement 
comes 
to 
a 
standstill. 
Can 
a 
workers' 
movement 
which 
has 
to 
be 
pushed 
on 
from 
outside 
be 
a 
real 
force? 
Of 
course 
not! 
. 
. 
. 
It 
has 
not 
yet 
learned 
to 
walk, 
it 
is 
still 
in 
leading 
strings. 
So 
it 
is 
in 
everything. 
The 
students 
go 
off, 
and 
everything 
comes 
to 
a 
standstill. 
The 
most 
capable 
among 
the 
cream 
are 
arrested 
--the 
milk 
turns 
sour. 
If 
the 
'committee' 
is 
arrested, 
everything 
comes 
to 
a 
standstill 
until 
a 
new 
one 
can 
be 
formed. 
And 
one 
never 
knows 
what 
sort 
of 
committee 



will 
be 
set 
up 
next 
--it 
may 
be 
nothing 
like 
the 
former 
one. 
The 
first 
preached 
one 
thing, 
the 
second 
may 
preach 
the 
very 
opposite. 
Continuity 
between 
yesterday 
and 
tomorrow 
is 
broken, 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
past 
does 
not 
serve 
as 
a 
guide 
for 
the 
future. 
And 
all 
this 
is 
because 
no 
deep 
roots 
have 
been 
struck 
in 
the 
crowd; 
the 
work 
is 
carried 
on 
not 
by 
a 
hundred 
fools, 
but 
by 
a 
dozen 
wise 
men. 
A 
dozen 
wise 
men 
can 
be 
wiped 
out 
at 
a 
snap, 
but 
when 
the 
organization 
embraces 
the 
crowd 
everything 
proceeds 
from 
the 
crowd, 
and 
nobody, 
however 
he 
tries, 
can 
stop 
the 
cause." 
(P. 
63.) 


The 
facts 
are 
described 
correctly. 
They 
provide 
a 
fairly 
good 
picture 
of 
our 
amateurishness. 
But 
the 
conclusions 
are 
worthy 
of 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
both 
for 
their 
stupidity 
and 
their 
lack 
of 
political 
tact. 
They 
represent 
the 
height 
of 
stupidity, 
because 
the 
author 
confuses 
the 
philosophical 
and 
social-
historical 
question 
of 
the 
"depth" 
of 
the 
"roots" 
of 
the 
movement 
with 
the 
technical 
and 
organizational 
question 
of 
the 
best 
method 
of 
fighting 
the 
gendarmes. 
They 
represent 
the 
height 
of 
political 
tactlessness, 
because 
the 
author, 
instead 
of 
appealing 
from 
bad 
leaders 
to 
good 
leaders, 
appeals 
from 


the 
leaders 
in 
general 
to 
the 
"crowd." 
This 
is 
as 
much 
an 
attempt 
to 
drag 
us 
back 
organizationally 
as 
the 
idea 
of 
substituting 
excitative 
terrorism 
for 
political 
agitation 
drags 
us 
back 
politically. 
Indeed, 
I 
am 
experiencing 
a 
veritable 
embarras 
de 
richesses,[86] 
and 
hardly 
know 
where 
to 
begin 
to 
disentangle 
the 
confusion 
created 
by 
the 
Svoboda. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
clarity, 
I 
shall 
try 
to 
begin 
by 
citing 
an 
example. 
Take 
the 
Germans. 
It 
will 
not 
be 
denied, 
I 
hope, 
that 
their 
organization 
embraces 
the 
crowd, 
that 
in 
Germany 
everything 
proceeds 
from 
the 
crowd, 
that 
the 
working-class 
movement 
there 
has 
learned 
to 
walk. 
Yet 
observe 
how 
this 
vast 
crowd 
of 
millions 
values 
its 
"dozen" 
tried 
political 
leaders, 
how 
firmly 
it 
clings 
to 
them! 
Members 
of 
the 
hostile 
parties 
in 
parliament 
have 
often 
teased 
the 
Socialists 
by 
exclaiming: 
"Fine 
democrats 
you 
are 
indeed! 
Yours 
is 
a 
working-class 
movement 
only 
in 
name; 
in 
actual 
fact 
it 
is 
the 
same 
clique 
of 
leaders 
that 
is 
always 
in 
evidence, 
Bebel 
and 
Liebknecht, 
year 
in 
and 
year 
out, 
and 
that 
goes 
on 
for 
decades. 
Your 
supposedly 
elected 
workers' 
deputies 
are 
more 
permanent 
than 
the 
officials 
appointed 
by 
the 
Emperor!" 
But 
the 
Germans 
only 
smile 
with 
contempt 
at 
these 
demagogic 
attempts 
to 
set 
the 
"crowd" 
against 
the 
"leaders," 
to 
arouse 
bad 
and 
ambitious 
instincts 
in 
the 
former, 
and 
to 
rob 
the 
movement 
of 
its 
solidity 
and 
stability 
by 
undermining 
the 
confidence 
of 
the 
masses 
in 
their 
"dozen 
wise 
men." 
Political 
thinking 
is 
already 
sufficiently 
developed 
among 
the 
Germans, 
and 
they 
have 
accumulated 
sufficient 



political 
experience 
to 
understand 
that 
without 
the 
"dozen" 
tried 
and 
talented 
leaders 
(and 
talented 
men 
are 
not 
born 
by 
the 
hundred), 
professionally 
trained, 
schooled 
by 
long 
experience 
and 
working 
in 
perfect 
harmony, 
no 
class 
in 
modern 
society 
can 
wage 
a 
determined 
struggle. 
The 
Germans 
too 
have 
had 
demagogues 
in 
their 
ranks 
who 
have 
flattered 


the 
"hundred 
fools," 
exalted 
them 
above 
the 
"dozen 
wise 
men," 
extolled 
the 
"mighty 
fists" 
of 
the 
masses, 
and 
(like 
Most 
and 
Hasselmann) 
have 
spurred 
them 
on 
to 
reckless 
"revolutionary" 
action 
and 
sown 
distrust 
towards 
the 
firm 
and 
steadfast 
leaders. 
It 
was 
only 
by 
stubbornly 
and 
relentlessly 
combating 
all 
demagogic 
elements 
within 
the 
socialist 
movement 
that 
German 
Socialism 
managed 
to 
grow 
and 
become 
as 
strong 
as 
it 
is. 
Our 
wiseacres, 
however, 
at 
a 
time 
when 
Russian 
Social-Democracy 
is 
passing 
through 
a 
crisis 
entirely 
due 
to 
the 
lack 
of 
sufficient 
numbers 
of 
trained, 
developed 
and 
experienced 
leaders 
to 
guide 
the 
spontaneously 
awakening 
masses, 
cry 
out 
with 
the 
profundity 
of 
fools: 
"it 
is 
a 
bad 
thing 
when 
the 
movement 
does 
not 
proceed 
from 
the 
rank 
and 
file." 


"A 
committee 
of 
students 
is 
no 
good, 
it 
is 
not 
stable." 
Quite 
true. 
But 
the 
conclusion 
to 
be 
drawn 
from 
this 
is 
that 
we 
must 
have 
a 
committee 
of 
professional 
revolutionaries 
and 
it 
does 
not 
matter 
whether 
a 
student 
or 
a 
worker 
is 
capable 
of 
becoming 
a 
professional 
revolutionary. 
The 
conclusion 
you 
draw, 
however, 
is 
that 
the 
working-class 
movement 
must 
not 
be 
pushed 
on 
from 
outside! 
In 
your 
political 
innocence 
you 
fail 
to 
notice 
that 
you 
are 
playing 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
our 
Economists 
and 
fostering 
our 
amateurishness. 
In 
what 
way, 
may 
I 
ask, 
did 
our 
students 
"push 
on" 
our 
workers? 
Solely 
by 
the 
student 
bringing 
to 
the 
worker 
the 
scraps 
of 
political 
knowledge 
he 
himself 
possessed, 
the 
crumbs 
of 
socialist 
ideas 
he 
had 
managed 
to 
acquire 
(for 
the 
principal 
intellectual 
diet 
of 
the 
present-day 
student, 
"legal 
Marxism," 
could 
furnish 
only 
the 
rudiments, 
only 
crumbs 
of 
knowledge). 
There 
has 
never 
been 
too 
much 
of 
such 
"pushing 
on 
from 
outside"; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
so 
far 
there 
has 
been 
too 
little, 
all 
too 
little 
of 
it 
in 
our 
movement, 
for 
we 
have 
been 
stewing 
too 
assiduously 


in 
our 
own 
juice; 
we 
have 
bowed 
far 
too 
slavishly 
to 
the 
elementary 
"economic 
struggle 
of 
the 
workers 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government." 
We 
professional 
revolutionaries 
must 
and 
will 
make 
it 
our 
business 
to 
engage 
in 
this 
kind 
of 
"pushing" 
a 
hundred 
times 
more 
forcibly 
than 
we 
have 
done 
hitherto. 
But 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
you 
select 
so 
despicable 
a 
phrase 
as 
"pushing 
on 
from 
outside" 
--a 
phrase 
which 
cannot 
but 
rouse 
in 
the 



workers 
(at 
least 
in 
the 
workers 
who 
are 
as 
unenlightened 
as 
you 
yourselves) 
a 
sense 
of 
distrust 
towards 
all 
who 
bring 
them 
political 
knowledge 
and 
revolutionary 
experience 
from 
outside, 
and 
rouse 
in 
them 
an 
instinctive 
desire 
to 
resist 
all 
such 
people 
--proves 
that 
you 
are 
demagogues, 
and 
demagogues 
are 
the 
worst 
enemies 
of 
the 
working 
class. 


Yes, 
yes! 
And 
don't 
start 
howling 
about 
my 
"uncomradely 
methods" 
of 
controversy! 
I 
have 
not 
the 
least 
intention 
of 
doubting 
the 
purity 
of 
your 
intentions. 
As 
I 
have 
already 
said, 
one 
may 
become 
a 
demagogue 
out 
of 
sheer 
political 
innocence. 
But 
I 
have 
shown 
that 
you 
have 
descended 
to 
demagogy, 
and 
I 
shall 
never 
tire 
of 
repeating 
that 
demagogues 
are 
the 
worst 
enemies 
of 
the 
working 
class. 
The 
worst 
enemies 
because 
they 
arouse 
bad 
instincts 
in 
the 
crowd, 
because 
the 
unenlightened 
worker 
is 
unable 
to 
recognize 
his 
enemies 
in 
men 
who 
represent 
themselves, 
and 
sometimes 
sincerely 
so, 
as 
his 
friends. 
The 
worst 
enemies 
because 
in 
the 
period 
of 
disunity 
and 
vacillation, 
when 
our 
movement 
is 
just 
beginning 
to 
take 
shape, 
nothing 
is 
easier 
than 
to 
employ 
demagogic 
methods 
to 
mislead 
the 
crowd 
which 
can 
realize 
its 
mistake 
only 
later 
by 
the 
most 
bitter 
experience. 
That 
is 
why 
the 
slogan 
of 
the 
day 
for 
the 
Russian 
Social-Democrat 
must 
be: 
resolute 
struggle 
against 
the 
Svoboda 
and 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
both 
of 


which 
have 
sunk 
to 
the 
level 
of 
demagogy. 
We 
shall 
deal 
with 
this 
in 
greater 
detail 
elsewhere.[*] 


"A 
dozen 
wise 
men 
can 
be 
more 
easily 
wiped 
out 
than 
a 
hundred 
fools!" 
This 
wonderful 
truth 
(for 
which 
the 
hundred 
fools 
will 
always 
applaud 
you) 
appears 
obvious 
only 
because 
in 
the 
very 
midst 
of 
the 
argument 
you 
have 
skipped 
from 
one 
question 
to 
another. 
You 
began 
by 
talking, 
and 
continue 
to 
talk 
of 
a 
"committee," 
an 
"organization" 
being 
wiped 
out, 
and 
now 
you 
skip 
to 
the 
question 
of 
the 
"depth" 
of 
the 
movement's 
"roots." 
The 
fact 
is, 
of 
course, 
that 
our 
movement 
cannot 
be 
wiped 
out 
precisely 
because 
it 
has 
hundreds 
and 
hundreds 
of 
thousands 
of 
roots 
deep 
down 
among 
the 
masses; 
but 
that 
is 
not 
the 
point 
we 
are 
discussing. 
As 
far 
as 
"deep 
roots" 
are 
concerned, 
we 
cannot 
be 
"wiped 
out" 
even 
now, 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
our 
amateurishness, 
and 
yet 
we 
all 
complain, 
and 
cannot 
but 
complain, 
that 
"organizations" 
are 
wiped 
out, 
with 
the 
result 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
maintain 
continuity 
in 
the 
movement. 
But 
since 
you 
raise 
the 
question 
of 
organizations 
being 
wiped 
out 
and 
stick 
to 
that 
question, 
then 
I 
assert 
that 
it 
is 
far 
more 
difficult 
to 
wipe 
out 
a 
dozen 
wise 
men 
than 
a 
hundred 
fools. 
And 
this 
position 
I 
shall 
defend 
no 
matter 
how 
much 
you 
instigate 
the 
crowd 



against 
me 
for 
my 
"anti-democratic" 
views, 
etc. 
As 
I 
have 
already 
said 
time 
and 
again 
that 
by 
"wise 
men," 
in 
connection 
with 
organization, 
mean 
professional 
revolutionaries, 
irrespective 
of 
whether 
they 
are 
trained 
from 
among 
students 
or 
workingmen. 
I 
assert: 
1) 
that 
no 
revolutionary 
movement 
can 
endure 
without 
a 
stable 


* 
For 
the 
moment 
let 
us 
observe 
merely 
that 
all 
our 
remarks 
on 
"pushing 
on 
from 
outside" 
and 
the 
Svoboda's 
other 
disquisitions 
on 
organization 
apply 
entirely 
to 
all 
the 
Economists, 
including 
the 
adherents 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
for 
either 
they 
themselves 
have 
actively 
preached 
and 
defended 
such 
views 
on 
organization, 
or 
have 
drifted 
into 
them. 
organization 
of 
leaders 
that 
maintains 
continuity; 
2) 
that 
the 
wider 
the 
masses 
spontaneously 
drawn 
into 
the 
struggle, 
forming 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
movement 
and 
participating 
in 
it, 
the 
more 
urgent 
the 
need 
of 
such 
an 
organization, 
and 
the 
more 
solid 
this 
organization 
must 
be 
(for 
it 
is 
much 
easier 
for 
demagogues 
to 
sidetrack 
the 
more 
backward 
sections 
of 
the 
masses); 
3) 
that 
such 
an 
organization 
must 
consist 
chiefly 
of 
people 
professionally 
engaged 
in 
revolutionary 
activity; 
4) 
that 
in 
an 
autocratic 
state, 
the 
more 
we 
confine 
the 
membership 
of 
such 
an 
organization 
to 
people 
who 
are 
professionally 
engaged 
in 
revolutionary 
activity 
and 
who 
have 
been 
professionally 
trained 
in 
the 
art 
of 
combating 
the 
political 
police, 
the 
more 
difficult 
will 
it 
be 
to 
wipe 
out 
such 
an 
organization, 
and 
5) 
the 
greater 
will 
be 
the 
number 
of 
people 
of 
the 
working 
class 
and 
of 
the 
other 
classes 
of 
society 
who 
will 
be 
able 
to 
join 
the 
movement 
and 
perform 
active 
work 
in 
it. 


I 
invite 
our 
Economists, 
terrorists 
and 
"Economists-terrorists"* 
to 
confute 
these 
propositions. 
At 
the 
moment, 
I 
shall 
deal 
only 
with 
the 
last 
two 
points. 
The 
question 
as 
to 
whether 
it 
is 
easier 
to 
wipe 
out 
"a 
dozen 
wise 
men" 
or 
"a 
hundred 
fools" 
reduces 
itself 
to 
the 
question 
we 
have 
considered 
above, 


* 
This 
latter 
term 
is 
perhaps 
more 
applicable 
to 
the 
Svoboda 
than 
the 
former, 
for 
in 
an 
article 
entitled 
"The 
Regeneration 
of 
Revolutionism" 
it 
defends 
terrorism, 
while 
in 
the 
article 
at 
present 
under 
review 
it 
defends 
Economism. 
One 
might 
say 
of 
the 
Svoboda 
that 
"it 
would 
if 
it 
could, 
but 
it 
can't." 
Its 
wishes 
and 
intentions 
are 
of 
the 
very 
best 
--but 
the 
result 
is 
utter 
confusion; 
and 
this 
is 
chiefly 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
while 
the 
Svoboda 
advocates 
continuity 
of 
organization, 
it 
refuses 
to 
recognize 
continuity 
of 
revolutionary 
thought 
and 
of 
Social-Democratic 
theory. 
It 
wants 
to 
revive 
the 
professional 
revolutionary 
("The 
Regeneration 
of 
Revolutionism"), 
and 
to 
that 
end 
proposes, 
first, 
excitative 
terrorism, 
and 
secondly, 
"an 
organization 
of 

average 
workers" 
(Svoboda, 
No. 
1, 
p. 
66 
et 
seq.), 
as 
less 
likely 
to 
be 
"pushed 
on 
from 
outside." 
In 
other 
words, 
it 
proposes 
to 
pull 
the 
house 
down 
to 
use 
the 
timber 
for 
warming 
it. 


namely, 
whether 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
have 
a 
mass 
organization 
when 
the 
maintenance 
of 
strict 
secrecy 
is 
essential. 
We 
can 
never 
give 
a 
mass 
organization 
that 
degree 
of 
secrecy 
without 
which 
there 
can 
be 
no 
question 
of 
persistent 
and 
continuous 
struggle 
against 
the 
government. 
But 
to 
concentrate 
all 
secret 
functions 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
as 
small 
a 
number 
of 
professional 
revolutionaries 
as 
possible 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
the 
latter 
will 
"do 
the 
thinking 
for 
all" 
and 
that 
the 
crowd 
will 
not 
take 
an 
active 
part 
in 
the 
movement. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
crowd 
will 
advance 
from 
its 
ranks 
increasing 
numbers 
of 
professional 
revolutionaries; 
for 
it 
will 
know 
that 
it 
is 
not 
enough 
for 
a 
few 
students 
and 
for 
a 
few 
workingmen 
waging 
the 
economic 
struggle, 
to 
gather 
together 
and 
form 
a 
"committee," 
but 
that 
it 
takes 
years 
to 
train 
oneself 
to 
be 
a 
professional 
revolutionary; 
the 
crowd 
will 
"think" 
not 
of 
amateurish 
methods 
alone 
but 
of 
such 
training. 
The 
centralization 
of 
the 
secret 
functions 
of 
the 
organization 
by 
no 
means 
implies 
the 
centralization 
of 
all 
the 
functions 
of 
the 
movement. 
The 
active 
participation 
of 
the 
widest 
mass 
in 
the 
illegal 
press 
will 
not 
diminish 
because 
a 
"dozen" 
professional 
revolutionaries 
centralize 
the 
secret 
functions 
connected 
with 
this 
work; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
it 
will 
increase 
tenfold. 
In 
this 
way, 
and 
in 
this 
way 
alone, 
will 
we 
ensure 
that 
reading 
of 
illegal 
literature, 
writing 
for 
it, 
and 
to 
some 
extent 
even 
distributing 
it, 
will 
almost 
cease 
to 
be 
secret 
work, 
for 
the 
police 
will 
soon 
come 
to 
realize 
the 
folly 
and 
futility 
of 
setting 
the 
whole 
judicial 
and 
administrative 
machine 
into 
motion 
to 
intercept 
every 
copy 
of 
publication 
that 
is 
being 
broadcast 
in 
thousands. 
This 
applies 
not 
only 
to 
the 
press, 
but 
to 
every 
function 
of 
the 
movement, 
even 
to 
demonstrations. 
The 
active 
and 
widespread 
participation 
of 
the 
masses 
will 
not 
suffer; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
it 
will 
benefit 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
"dozen" 
experienced 


revolutionaries, 
trained 
professionally 
no 
less 
than 
the 
police, 
will 
centralize 
all 
the 
secret 
aspects 
of 
the 
work 
--drawing 
up 
leaflets, 
working 
out 
approximate 
plans 
and 
appointing 
bodies 
of 
leaders 
for 
each 
urban 
district, 
for 
each 
factory 
district 
and 
for 
each 
educational 
institution, 
etc. 
(I 
know 
that 
exception 
will 
be 
taken 
to 
my 
"undemocratic" 
views, 
but 
I 
shall 
reply 
fully 
to 
this 
anything 
but 
intelligent 
objection 
later 
on.) 
The 
centralization 
of 
the 
most 
secret 
functions 
in 
an 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries 
will 
not 
diminish, 
but 
rather 
increase 
the 
extent 
and 
quality 
of 



the 
activity 
of 
a 
large 
number 
of 
other 
organizations 
which 
are 
intended 
for 
a 
broad 
public 
and 
are 
therefore 
as 
loose 
and 
as 
non-secret 
as 
possible, 
such 
as 
workers' 
trade 
unions, 
workers' 
self-education 
circles 
and 
circles 
for 
reading 
illegal 
literature, 
socialist 
and 
also 
democratic 
circles 
among 
all 
other 
sections 
of 
the 
population, 
etc., 
etc. 
We 
must 
have 
such 
circles, 
trade 
unions 
and 
organizations 
everywhere 
in 
as 
large 
a 
number 
as 
possible 
and 
with 
the 
widest 
variety 
of 
functions; 
but 
it 
would 
be 
absurd 
and 
dangerous 
to 
confuse 
them 
with 
the 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries, 
to 
obliterate 
the 
border 
line 
between 
them, 
to 
dim 
still 
more 
the 
masses' 
already 
incredibly 
hazy 
appreciation 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
order 
to 
"serve" 
the 
mass 
movement 
we 
must 
have 
people 
who 
will 
devote 
themselves 
exclusively 
to 
Social-
Democratic 
activities, 
and 
that 
such 
people 
must 
train 
themselves 
patiently 
and 
steadfastly 
to 
be 
professional 
revolutionaries. 


Yes, 
this 
appreciation 
has 
become 
incredibly 
dim. 
Our 
chief 
sin 
with 
regard 
to 
organization 
is 
that 
by 
our 
amateurishness 
we 
have 
lowered 
the 
prestige 
of 
revolutionaries 
in 
Russia. 
A 
person 
who 
is 
flabby 
and 
shaky 
in 
questions 
of 
theory, 
who 
has 
a 
narrow 
outlook, 
who 
pleads 
the 
spontaneity 
of 
the 
masses 
as 
an 
excuse 
for 
his 
own 
sluggishness, 
who 
resembles 


a 
trade 
union 
secretary 
more 
than 
a 
people's 
tribune, 
who 
is 
unable 
to 
conceive 
of 
a 
broad 
and 
bold 
plan 
that 
would 
command 
the 
respect 
even 
of 
opponents, 
and 
who 
is 
inexperienced 
and 
clumsy 
in 
his 
own 
professional 
art 
-
the 
art 
of 
combating 
the 
political 
police 
--why, 
such 
a 
man 
is 
not 
a 
revolutionary 
but 
a 
wretched 
amateur! 


Let 
no 
active 
worker 
take 
offence 
at 
these 
frank 
remarks, 
for 
as 
far 
as 
insufficient 
training 
is 
concerned, 
I 
apply 
them 
first 
and 
foremost 
to 
myself. 
I 
used 
to 
work 
in 
a 
circle[87] 
that 
set 
itself 
very 
wide, 
all-embracing 
tasks; 
and 
all 
of 
us, 
members 
of 
that 
circle, 
suffered 
painfully, 
acutely 
from 
the 
realization 
that 
we 
were 
proving 
ourselves 
to 
be 
amateurs 
at 
a 
moment 
in 
history 
when 
we 
might 
have 
been 
able 
to 
say, 
paraphrasing 
a 
well-known 
epigram: 
"Give 
us 
an 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries, 
and 
we 
shall 
overturn 
Russia!" 
And 
the 
more 
I 
recall 
the 
burning 
sense 
of 
shame 
I 
then 
experienced, 
the 
more 
bitter 
are 
my 
feelings 
towards 
those 
pseudo 
Social-
Democrats 
whose 
teachings 
"bring 
disgrace 
on 
the 
calling 
of 
a 
revolutionary," 
who 
fail 
to 
understand 
that 
our 
task 
is 
not 
to 
champion 
the 
degrading 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
to 
the 
level 
of 
an 
amateur, 
but 
to 
raise 
the 
amateurs 
to 
the 
level 
of 
revolutionaries. 



D. 
THE 
SCOPE 
OF 
ORGANIZATIONAL 
WORK 
We 
have 
already 
heard 
from 
B-v 
about 
"the 
lack 
of 
revolutionary 
forces 
fit 
for 
action 
which 
is 
felt 
not 
only 
in 
St. 
Petersburg, 
but 
throughout 
the 
whole 
of 
Russia." 
Hardly 
anyone 
will 
dispute 
this 
fact. 
But 
the 
question 
is, 
how 
is 
it 
to 
be 
explained? 
B-v 
writes: 


"We 
shall 
not 
go 
into 
an 
explanation 
of 
the 
historical 
causes 
of 
this 
phenomenon; 
we 
shall 
merely 
state 
that 
a 
society, 
demoralized 
by 
prolonged 
political 
reaction 
and 
split 
by 
past 
and 
present 
economic 
changes, 
advances 
from 
its 
own 
ranks 
an 
extremely 
small 
number 
of 
persons 
fit 
for 
revolutionary 
work; 
that 
the 
working 
class 
does 
advance 
revolutionary 
workers 
who 
to 
some 
extent 
reinforce 
the 
ranks 
of 
the 
illegal 
organizations, 
but 
that 
the 
number 
of 
such 
revolutionaries 
is 
inadequate 
to 
meet 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
times. 
This 
is 
all 
the 
more 
so 
because 
the 
worker 
who 
spends 
eleven 
and 
a 
half 
hours 
a 
day 
in 
the 
factory 
is 
in 
such 
a 
position 
that 
he 
can 
perform, 
mainly, 
the 
functions 
of 
an 
agitator; 
but 
propaganda 
and 
organization, 
delivery 
and 
reproduction 
of 
illegal 
literature, 
issuing 
leaflets, 
etc., 
are 
duties 
which 
must 
necessarily 
fall 
mainly 
upon 
the 
shoulders 
of 
an 
extremely 
small 
force 
of 
intellectuals." 
(Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No. 
6, 
pp. 
38-39.) 


On 
many 
points 
we 
disagree 
with 
B-v, 
particularly 
with 
the 
words 
we 
have 
emphasized, 
and 
which 
bring 
out 
most 
saliently 
that, 
although 
weary 
of 
our 
amateurishness 
(as 
is 
every 
practical 
worker 
who 
thinks 
over 
the 
position), 
B-v 
cannot 
find 
the 
way 
out 
of 
this 
intolerable 
situation, 
because 
he 
is 
ground 
down 
by 
Economism. 
The 
fact 
of 
the 
matter 
is 
that 
society 
advances 
very 
many 
persons 
fit 
for 
"work," 
but 
we 
are 
unable 
to 
make 
use 
of 
them 
all. 
The 
critical, 
transitional 
state 
of 
our 
movement 
in 
this 
respect 
may 
be 
formulated 
as 
follows: 
there 
are 
no 
people 
--yet 
there 
is 
a 
mass 
of 
people. 
There 
is 
a 
mass 
of 
people, 
because 
the 
working 
class 
and 
ever 
more 
diverse 
strata 
of 
society, 
year 
after 
year, 
advance 
from 
their 
ranks 
an 
increasing 
number 
of 
discontented 
people 
who 
desire 
to 
protest, 
who 
are 
ready 
to 
render 
all 
the 
assistance 
they 
can 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
absolutism, 
the 
intolerableness 
of 
which 
is 
not 
yet 
recognized 
by 
all, 
but 
is 
nevertheless 
more 
and 
more 
acutely 
sensed 
by 
increasing 
masses 
of 
the 
people. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
we 
have 
no 
people, 
because 
we 
have 
no 
leaders, 
no 
political 
leaders, 
no 
talented 
organizers 
capable 
of 
arranging 
extensive 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
uniform 
and 
harmonious 
work 
that 
would 
employ 
all 
forces, 
even 
the 
most 
in



considerable. 
"The 
growth 
and 
development 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
organizations," 
not 
only 
lag 
behind 
the 
growth 
of 
the 
working-class 
movement, 
which 
even 
B-v 
admits, 
but 
also 
behind 
that 
of 
the 
general 
democratic 
movement 
among 
all 
strata 
of 
the 
people. 
(In 
passing, 
probably 
B-v 
would 
now 
regard 
this 
as 
supplementing 
his 
conclusion.) 
The 
scope 
of 
revolutionary 
work 
is 
too 
narrow 
compared 
with 
the 
breadth 
of 
the 
spontaneous 
basis 
of 
the 
movement. 
It 
is 
too 
hemmed 
in 
by 
the 
wretched 
theory 
of 
"economic 
struggle 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government." 
And 
yet, 
at 
the 
present 
time, 
not 
only 
Social-Democratic 
political 
agitators, 
but 
also 
Social-Democratic 
organizers 
must 
"go 
among 
all 
classes 
of 
the 
population."[*] 
There 
is 
hardly 
a 
single 
practical 
worker 
who 
will 
doubt 
that 
the 
Social-Democrats 
could 
distribute 
the 
thousand 
and 
one 
minute 
functions 
of 
their 
organizational 
work 
among 
the 
different 
representatives 
of 
the 
most 
varied 
classes. 
Lack 
of 
specialization 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
serious 
defects 
of 
our 
technique, 
about 
which 
B-v 
justly 
and 
bitterly 
complains. 
The 
smaller 
each 
separate 
"operation" 
in 
our 
common 
cause, 
the 
more 
people 
can 
we 
find 
capable 
of 
carrying 
out 
such 
operations 
(people 
who, 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
cases, 
are 
absolutely 
not 
capable 
of 
becoming 
professional 
revolutionaries), 
the 
more 
difficult 
will 
it 
be 
for 
the 
police 
to 
"net" 
all 
these 
"detail 
workers," 
and 
the 
more 
difficult 
will 
it 
be 
for 
them 
to 
frame 
up, 
out 
of 
an 
arrest 
for 
some 
petty 
affair, 


* 
For 
example, 
an 
undoubted 
revival 
of 
the 
democratic 
spirit 
has 
recently 
been 
observed 
among 
persons 
in 
military 
service, 
partly 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
more 
frequent 
street 
fights 
against 
"enemies" 
like 
workers 
and 
students. 
And 
as 
soon 
as 
our 
available 
forces 
permit, 
we 
must 
without 
fail 
devote 
the 
most 
serious 
attention 
to 
propaganda 
and 
agitation 
among 
soldiers 
and 
officers, 
and 
to 
the 
creation 
of 
"military 
organizations" 
affiliated 
to 
our 
Party. 
a 
"case" 
that 
would 
justify 
the 
government's 
expenditure 
on 
the 
"secret 
service." 
As 
for 
the 
number 
ready 
to 
help 
us, 
we 
have 
already 
referred 
in 
the 
previous 
chapter 
to 
the 
gigantic 
change 
that 
has 
taken 
place 
in 
this 
respect 
in 
the 
last 
five 
years 
or 
so. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
in 
order 
to 
unite 
all 
these 
tiny 
fractions 
into 
one 
whole, 
in 
order 
not 
to 
break 
up 
the 
movement 
while 
breaking 
up 
its 
functions, 
and 
in 
order 
to 
imbue 
the 
people 
who 
carry 
out 
the 
minute 
functions 
with 
the 
conviction 
that 
their 
work 
is 
necessary 
and 
important, 
without 
which 
conviction 
they 
will 
never 
do 
the 
work,* 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
have 
a 
strong 
organization 
of 
tried 
revolutionaries. 
The 
more 



secret 
such 
an 
organization 
is, 
the 
stronger 
and 
more 
widespread 
will 
be 
the 
confidence 
in 
the 
Party, 
and, 
as 
we 
know, 
in 
time 
of 
war, 
it 
is 
of 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 


* 
I 
recall 
what 
a 
comrade 
related 
to 
me 
of 
a 
factory 
inspector, 
who 
desiring 
to 
help, 
and 
while 
in 
fact 
helping, 
the 
Social-Democrats, 
bitterly 
complained 
that 
he 
did 
not 
know 
whether 
his 
"information" 
reached 
the 
proper 
revolutionary 
centre, 
how 
much 
his 
help 
was 
really 
required, 
and 
what 
possibilities 
there 
were 
for 
utilizing 
his 
small 
and 
petty 
services. 
Every 
practical 
worker 
can, 
of 
course, 
cite 
many 
similar 
cases 
of 
our 
amateurishness 
depriving 
us 
of 
allies. 
And 
these 
services, 
each 
"small" 
in 
itself, 
but 
invaluable 
when 
taken 
in 
the 
mass, 
could 
and 
would 
be 
rendered 
to 
us 
by 
office 
employees 
and 
officials 
not 
only 
in 
factories, 
but 
in 
the 
postal 
service, 
on 
the 
railways, 
in 
the 
Customs, 
among 
the 
nobility, 
the 
clergy 
and 
in 
every 
other 
walk 
of 
life, 
including 
even 
the 
police 
and 
the 
Court! 
Had 
we 
a 
real 
party, 
a 
real 
militant 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries, 
we 
would 
not 
make 
undue 
demands 
on 
every 
one 
of 
these 
"assistants," 
we 
would 
not 
hasten 
always 
and 
invariably 
to 
bring 
them 
right 
into 
the 
very 
heart 
of 
our 
"illegality," 
but, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
we 
would 
husband 
them 
very 
carefully 
and 
would 
even 
train 
people 
especially 
for 
such 
functions, 
bearing 
in 
mind 
the 
fact 
that 
many 
students 
could 
be 
of 
much 
greater 
service 
to 
the 
Party 
as 
"assistants" 
holding 
some 
official 
post 
than 
as 
"short-term" 
revolutionaries. 
But, 
I 
repeat 
again, 
only 
an 
organization 
that 
is 
already 
established 
and 
has 
no 
lack 
of 
active 
forces 
would 
have 
the 
right 
to 
apply 
such 
tactics. 
imbue 
not 
only 
one's 
own 
army 
with 
confidence 
in 
its 
strength, 
but 
it 
is 
important 
also 
to 
convince 
the 
enemy 
and 
all 
neutral 
elements 
of 
this 
strength; 
friendly 
neutrality 
may 
sometimes 
decide 
the 
issue. 
If 
such 
an 
organization 
existed, 
one 
built 
up 
on 
a 
firm 
theoretical 
foundation 
and 
possessing 
a 
Social-Democratic 
journal, 
we 
would 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
fear 
that 
the 
movement 
might 
be 
diverted 
from 
its 
path 
by 
the 
numerous 
"outside" 
elements 
that 
are 
attracted 
to 
it. 
(On 
the 
contrary, 
it 
is 
precisely 
at 
the 
present 
time, 
with 
amateurishness 
prevalent, 
that 
we 
see 
many 
Social-Democrats 
leaning 
towards 
the 
Credo, 
and 
only 
imagining 
that 
they 
are 
Social-
Democrats.) 
In 
a 
word, 
specialization 
necessarily 
presupposes 
centralization, 
and 
in 
its 
turn 
imperatively 
calls 
for 
it. 


But 
B-v 
himself, 
who 
has 
so 
excellently 
described 
the 
necessity 
for 
specialization, 
underestimates 
its 
importance, 
in 
our 
opinion, 
in 
the 
second 
part 
of 
the 
argument 
that 
we 
have 
quoted. 
The 
number 
of 
working-class 



revolutionaries 
is 
inadequate, 
he 
says. 
This 
is 
perfectly 
true, 
and 
once 
again 
we 
stress 
that 
the 
"valuable 
communication 
of 
a 
close 
observer" 
fully 
confirms 
our 
view 
of 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
present 
crisis 
in 
Social-Democracy, 
and, 
consequently, 
of 
the 
means 
required 
for 
overcoming 
it. 
Not 
only 
are 
revolutionaries 
in 
general 
lagging 
behind 
the 
spontaneous 
awakening 
of 
the 
masses, 
but 
even 
working-class 
revolutionaries 
are 
lagging 
behind 
the 
spontaneous 
awakening 
of 
the 
working-class 
masses. 
And 
this 
fact 
most 
strikingly 
confirms, 
even 
from 
the 
"practical" 
point 
of 
view, 
not 
only 
the 
absurdity 
but 
even 
the 
political 
reactionariness 
of 
the 
"pedagogics" 
to 
which 
we 
are 
so 
often 
treated 
when 
discussing 
our 
duties 
to 
our 
workers. 
This 
fact 
proves 
that 
our 
very 
first 
and 
most 
imperative 
duty 
is 
to 
help 
to 
train 
working-class 
revolutionaries 
who 
will 
be 


on 
the 
same 
level 
in 
regard 
to 
Party 
activity 
as 
the 
revolutionaries 
from 
amongst 
the 
intellectuals 
(we 
emphasize 
the 
words 
"in 
regard 
to 
Party 
activity," 
because 
although 
necessary, 
it 
is 
neither 
so 
easy 
nor 
so 
imperative 
to 
bring 
the 
workers 
up 
to 
the 
level 
of 
intellectuals 
in 
other 
respects). 
Therefore, 
attention 
must 
be 
devoted 
principally 
to 
raising 
the 
workers 
to 
the 
level 
of 
revolutionaries; 
it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
our 
task 
to 
descend 
to 
the 
level 
of 
the 
"working 
masses" 
as 
the 
Economists 
wish 
to 
do, 
or 
to 
the 
level 
of 
the 
"average 
worker," 
as 
the 
Svoboda 
desires 
to 
do 
(which 
thus 
ascends 
to 
the 
second 
grade 
of 
Economist 
"pedagogics"). 
I 
am 
far 
from 
denying 
the 
necessity 
for 
popular 
literature 
for 
the 
workers, 
and 
especially 
popular 
(but, 
of 
course, 
not 
vulgar) 
literature 
for 
the 
especially 
backward 
workers. 
But 
what 
annoys 
me 
is 
this 
constant 
confusion 
of 
pedagogics 
with 
questions 
of 
politics 
and 
organization. 
You, 
gentlemen, 
who 
are 
so 
much 
concerned 
about 
the 
"average 
worker," 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
rather 
insult 
the 
workers 
by 
your 
desire 
to 
talk 
down 
to 
them 
when 
discussing 
working-class 
politics 
and 
working-class 
organization. 
Talk 
about 
serious 
things 
in 
a 
serious 
manner, 
leave 
pedagogics 
to 
the 
pedagogues, 
and 
not 
to 
politicians, 
nor 
to 
organizers! 
Are 
there 
not 
advanced 
people, 
"average 
people," 
and 
the 
"mass," 
among 
the 
intelligentsia 
too? 
Does 
not 
everyone 
recognize 
that 
popular 
literature 
is 
also 
required 
for 
the 
intelligentsia 
and 
is 
not 
such 
literature 
written? 
Just 
imagine 
someone, 
in 
an 
article 
on 
organizing 
college 
or 
high-school 
students, 
repeating 
over 
and 
over 
again, 
as 
if 
he 
had 
made 
a 
new 
discovery, 
that 
first 
of 
all 
we 
must 
have 
an 
organization 
of 
"average 
students." 
The 
author 
of 
such 
an 
article 
would 
be 
ridiculed, 
and 
rightly 
so. 
He 
would 
be 
told: 
give 
us 
your 
ideas 
on 
organization, 
if 
you 
have 
any, 
and 
we 
ourselves 
will 
decide 
who 
is 



"aver


age," 
who 
above 
average, 
who 
below 
average. 
But 
if 
you 
have 
no 
organizational 
ideas 
of 
your 
own, 
then 
all 
your 
exertions 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
"masses" 
and 
"average" 
will 
be 
simply 
boring. 
You 
must 
realize 
that 
these 
questions 
about 
"politics" 
and 
"organization" 
are 
so 
serious 
in 
themselves 
that 
they 
cannot 
be 
discussed 
in 
any 
other 
but 
a 
very 
serious 
way. 
We 
can 
and 
must 
educate 
workers 
(and 
universify 
and 
high-school 
students) 
so 
as 
to 
be 
able 
to 
discuss 
these 
questions 
with 
them; 
but 
once 
you 
do 
bring 
up 
these 
questions, 
you 
must 
give 
real 
replies 
to 
them, 
do 
not 
fall 
back 
on 
the 
"average," 
or 
on 
the 
"masses"; 
do 
not 
try 
to 
get 
off 
by 
resorting 
to 
empty 
phrasemongering.[*] 


In 
order 
to 
be 
fully 
prepared 
for 
his 
task, 
the 
worker 
revolutionary 
must 
also 
become 
a 
professional 
revolutionary. 
Hence 
B-v 
is 
wrong 
when 
he 
says 
that 
since 
the 
worker 
spends 
eleven 
and 
a 
half 
hours 
in 
the 
factory, 
the 
brunt 
of 
all 
other 
revolutionary 
functions 
(apart 
from 
agitation) 
"must 
necessarily 
fall 
mainly 
upon 
the 
shoulders 
of 
an 
extremely 
small 
force 
of 
intellectuals." 
But 
this 
is 
not 
out 
of 
sheer 
"necessity." 
It 
is 
so 
because 
we 
are 
backward, 
because 
we 
do 
not 
recognize 
our 
duty 
to 
assist 
every 
capable 
worker 
to 
become 
a 
professional 
agitator, 
organizer, 
propagandist, 
literature 
distributor, 
etc., 
etc. 
In 
this 
respect, 
we

p. 
66, 
in 
the 
article 
"Organization": 
"The 
heavy 
tread 
of 
the 
army 
of 
workers 
will 
reinforce 
all 
the 
demands 
that 
will 
be 
advanced 
on 
behalf 
of 
Russian 
Labour" 
--Labour 
with 
a 
capital 
L, 
of 
course. 
And 
this 
very 
author 
exclaims: 
"I 
am 
not 
in 
the 
least 
hostile 
towards 
the 
intelligentsia, 
but" 
(this 
is 
the 
very 
word, 
but, 
that 
Shchedrin 
translated 
as 
meaning: 
the 
ears 
never 
grow 
higher 
than 
the 
forehead, 
never!) 
"but 
it 
always 
frightfully 
annoys 
me 
when 
a 
man 
comes 
to 
me, 
utters 
beautiful 
and 
charming 
words 
and 
demands 
that 
they 
be 
accepted 
for

beauty 
and 
other 
virtues." 
(P. 
62.) 
Yes. 
This 
"always 
frightfully 
annoys" 
me 
too. 
waste 
our 
strength 
in 
a 
positively 
shameful 
manner; 
we 
lack 
the 
ability 
to 
husband 
that 
which 
should 
be 
tended 
and 
reared 
with 
special 
care. 
Look 
at 
the 
Germans: 
they 
have 
a 
hundred 
times 
more 
forces 
than 
we 
have. 
But 
they 
understand 
perfectly 
well 
that 
the 
"average" 
does 
not 
too 
frequently 
promote 
really 
capable 
agitators, 
etc., 
from 
its 
ranks. 
That 
is 
why 
they 
immediately 
try 
to 
place 
every 
capable 
workingman 
in 
such 
conditions 
as 
will 
enable 
him 
to 
develop 
and 
apply 
his 
abilities 
to 
the 
utmost: 
he 
is 
made 
a 
professional 
agitator, 
he 
is 
encouraged 
to 
widen 
the 
held 
of 
his 
activity, 
to 
spread 
it 
from 



one 
factory 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
industry, 
from 
one 
locality 
to 
the 
whole 
country. 
He 
acquires 
experience 
and 
dexterity 
in 
his 
profession, 
he 
broadens 
his 
outlook 
and 
increases 
his 
knowledge, 
he 
observes 
at 
close 
quarters 
the 
prominent 
political 
leaders 
from 
other 
localities 
and 
of 
other 
parties, 
he 
strives 
to 
rise 
to 
their 
level 
and 
combine 
within 
himself 
the 
knowledge 
of 
working-class 
environment 
and 
freshness 
of 
socialist 
convictions 
with 
professional 
skill, 
without 
which 
the 
proletariat 
cannot 
wage 
a 
stubborn 
struggle 
against 
its 
excellently 
trained 
enemies. 
In 
this 
way 
and 
in 
this 
way 
alone 
does 
the 
mass 
of 
workers 
produce 
men 
like 
Bebel 
and 
Auer. 
But 
what 
in 
a 
politically 
free 
country 
takes 
place 
very 
largely 
automatically 
must 
in 
Russia 
be 
done 
deliberately 
and 
systematically 
by 
our 
organizations. 
A 
worker-agitator 
who 
is 
at 
all 
talented 
and 
"promising" 
must 
not 
be 
left 
to 
work 
eleven 
hours 
a 
day 
in 
a 
factory. 
We 
must 
arrange 
that 
he 
be 
maintained 
by 
the 
Party, 
that 
he 
may 
go 
underground 
in 
good 
time, 
that 
he 
change 
the 
place 
of 
his 
activity, 
otherwise 
he 
will 
not 
enlarge 
his 
experience, 
he 
will 
not 
widen 
his 
outlook, 
and 
will 
not 
be 
able 
to 
hold 
out 
for 
at 
least 
a 
few 
years 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
the 
gendarmes. 
As 
the 
spontaneous 
rise 
of 
the 
working-class 


masses 
becomes 
wider 
and 
deeper, 
they 
promote 
from 
their 
ranks 
not 
only 
an 
increasing 
number 
of 
talented 
agitators, 
but 
also 
talented 
organizers, 
propagandists 
and 
"practical 
workers" 
in 
the 
best 
sense 
of 
the 
term 
(of 
whom 
there 
are 
so 
few 
among 
our 
intelligentsia 
who, 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
in 
the 
Russian 
manner, 
are 
somewhat 
careless 
and 
sluggish 
in 
their 
habits). 
When 
we 
have 
detachments 
of 
specially 
trained 
worker-revolutionaries 
who 
have 
gone 
through 
extensive 
preparation 
(and, 
of 
course, 
revolutionaries 
"of 
all 
arms"), 
no 
political 
police 
in 
the 
world 
will 
then 
be 
able 
to 
contend 
against 
them, 
for 
these 
detachments 
of 
men 
absolutely 
devoted 
to 
the 
revolution 
will 
themselves 
enjoy 
the 
absolute 
confidence 
of 
the 
widest 
masses 
of 
the 
workers. 
And 
we 
are 
directly 
to 
blame 
for 
doing 
too 
little 
to 
"stimulate" 
the 
workers 
to 
take 
this 
path, 
common 
to 
them 
and 
to 
the 
"intellectuals," 
of 
professional 
revolutionary 
training, 
and 
that 
we 
too 
frequently 
drag 
them 
back 
by 
our 
silly 
speeches 
about 
what 
"can 
be 
understood" 
by 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers, 
by 
the 
"average 
workers," 
etc. 


In 
this, 
as 
in 
other 
respects, 
the 
narrow 
scope 
of 
our 
organizational 
work 
is 
without 
a 
doubt 
directly 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
(although 
the 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
the 
"Economists" 
and 
the 
novices 
in 
practical 
work 
do 
not 
appreciate 
it) 
that 
we 
restrict 
our 
theories 
and 
our 
political 
tasks 
to 
a 
narrow 
field. 
Worship 
of 
spontaneity 
seems 
to 
inspire 
a 
fear 
of 
taking 
even 
one 
step 



away 
from 
what 
"can 
be 
understood" 
by 
the 
masses, 
a 
fear 
of 
rising 
too 
high 
above 
mere 
subservience 
to 
the 
immediate 
and 
direct 
requirements 
of 
the 
masses. 
Have 
no 
fear, 
gentlemen! 
Remember 
that 
we 
stand 
so 
low 
on 
the 
plane 
of 
organization 
that 
the 
very 
idea 
that 
we 
could 
rise 
too 
high 
is 
absurd! 



E. 
A 
"CONSPIRATORIAL" 
ORGANIZATION 
AND 
"DEMOCRACY" 
And 
yet 
there 
are 
many 
people 
among 
us 
who 
are 
so 
sensitive 
to 
the 
"voice 
of 
life" 
that 
they 
fear 
it 
more 
than 
anything 
in 
the 
world 
and 
accuse 
those 
who 
adhere 
to 
the 
views 
here 
expounded 
of 
Narodnaya 
Volya-ism, 
of 
failing 
to 
understand 
"democracy," 
etc. 
We 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
these 
accusations, 
which, 
of 
course, 
have 
been 
echoed 
by 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo. 


The 
writer 
of 
these 
lines 
knows 
very 
well 
that 
the 
St. 
Petersburg 
Economists 
even 
accused 
the 
Rabochaya 
Gazeta 
of 
being 
Narodnaya 
Volyaite 
(which 
is 
quite 
understandable 
when 
one 
compares 
it 
with 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
). 
We 
were 
not 
in 
the 
least 
surprised, 
therefore, 
when, 
soon 
after 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
Iskra, 
a 
comrade 
informed 
us 
that 
the 
Social-Democrats 
in 
the 
town 
of 
X 
describe 
the 
Iskra 
as 
a 
Narodnaya 
Volya-ite 
journal. 
We, 
of 
course, 
were 
flattered 
by 
this 
accusation, 
for 
what 
decent 
Social-Democrat 
has 
not 
been 
accused 
by 
the 
Economists 
of 
being 
a 
Narodnaya 
Volya-ite? 


These 
acusations 
are 
the 
result 
of 
a 
twofold 
misunderstanding. 
First 
the 
history 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
movement 
is 
so 
little 
known 
among 
us 
that 
the 
name 
"Narodnaya 
Volya" 
is 
used 
to 
denote 
any 
idea 
of 
a 
militant 
centraiized 
organization 
which 
declares 
determined 
war 
upon 
tsarism. 
But 
the 
magnificent 
organization 
that 
the 
revolutionaries 
had 
in 
the 
'seventies, 
and 
which 
should 
serve 
us 
as 
a 
model, 
was 
not 
established 
by 
the 
Narodnaya 
Volya-ites, 
but 
by 
the 
Zemlya 
i 
Volya-ites, 
who 
split 
up 
into 
the 
Cherny 
Peredel 
and 
Narodnaya 
Volya. 
Consequently, 
to 
regard 
a 
militant 
revolutionary 
organization 
as 
something 
specifically 
Narod


naya 
Volya-ite 
is 
absurd 
both 
historically 
and 
logically, 
because 
no 
revolutionary 
tendency, 
if 
it 
seriously 
thinks 
of 
fighting, 
can 
dispense 
with 
such 
an 
organization. 
The 
mistake 
the 
Narodnaya 
Volya-ites 
committed 
was 
not 
that 
they 
strove 
to 
enlist 
in 
their 
organization 
all 
the 
discontented, 
and 
to 
direct 
this 
organization 
to 
decisive 
battle 
against 
the 
autocracy; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
that 
was 
their 
great 
historical 
merit. 
Their 
mistake 
was 
that 
they 
relied 
on 
a 
theory 
which 
in 
substance 
was 
not 
a 
revolutionary 
at 
all, 
and 
they 
either 
did 
not 
know 
how, 
or 
were 
unable, 
inseparably 
to 
link 
up 
their 
movement 
with 
the 
class 
struggle 
within 
developing 
capitalist 
society. 
And 
only 
a 
gross 
failure 
to 
understand 
Marxism 
(or 
an 
"understanding" 
of 
it 
in 
the 
spirit 
of 
Struve-ism) 
could 
prompt 
the 
opinion 
that 
the 
rise 
of 
a 
mass, 
spontaneous 
working-class 
movement 
relieves 
us 
of 
the 
duty 
of 
creating 
as 



good 
an 
organization 
of 
revolution 
aries 
as 
the 
Zemlya 
i 
Volya 
had, 
and 
even 
an 
incomparably 
better 
one. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
this 
movement 
imposes 
this 
duty 
upon 
us, 
because 
the 
spontaneous 
struggle 
of 
the 
proletariat 
will 
not 
become 
its 
genuine 
"class 
struggle" 
until 
this 
struggle 
is 
led 
by 
a 
strong 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries. 


Secondly, 
many, 
including 
apparently 
B. 
Krichevsky 
(Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No. 
10, 
p. 
18), 
misunderstand 
the 
polemics 
that 
Social-Democrats 
have 
always 
waged 
against 
the 
"conspirative" 
view 
of 
the 
political 
struggle. 
We 
have 
always 
protested, 
and 
will, 
of 
course, 
continue 
to 
protest 
against 
confining 
the 
political 
struggle 
to 
a 
conspiracy.[88] 
But 
this 
does 
not, 
of 
course, 
mean 
that 
we 
deny 
the 
need 
for 
a 
strong 
revolutionary 
organization. 
And, 
for 
example, 
in 
the 
pamphlet 
mentioned 
in 
the 
preceding 
footnote, 
after 
the 
polemics 
against 
reducing 
the 
political 
struggle 
to 
a 
conspiracy, 
a 
description 
is 
given 
(as 
a 
Social-Democratic 
ideal) 
of 
an 


organization 
so 
strong 
as 
to 
be 
able 
to 
"resort 
to. 
. 
. 
rebellion" 
and 
to 
every 
"other 
form 
of 
attack," 
in 
order 
to 
"deliver 
a 
smashing 
blow 
against 
absolutism."[*] 
In 
form 
such 
a 
strong 
revolutionary 
organization 
in 
an 
autocratic 
country 
may 
also 
be 
described 
as 
a 
"conspiratorial" 
organization, 
because 
the 
French 
word 
"conspiration 
" 
is 
tantamount 
to 
the 
Russian 
word 
"zagovor 
" 
("conspiracy"), 
and 
we 
must 
have 
the 
utmost 
secrecy 
for 
an 
organization 
of 
that 
kind. 
Secrecy 
is 
such 
a 
necessary 
condition 
for 
this 
kind 
of 
organization 
that 
all 
the 
other 
conditions 
(number 
and 
selection 
of 
members, 
functions, 
etc.) 
must 
be 
made 
to 
conform 
to 
it. 
It 
would 
be 
extremely 
naïve 
indeed, 
therefore, 
to 
fear 
the 
accusation 
that 
we 
Social-
Democrats 
desire 
to 
create 
a 
conspiratorial 
organization. 
Such 
an 
accusation 
should 
be 
as 
flattering 
to 
every 
opponent 
of 
Economism 
as 
the 
accusation 
of 
being 
followers 
of 
Narodnaya 
Volya. 


The 
objection 
may 
be 
raised: 
such 
a 
powerful 
and 
strictly 
secret 
organization, 
which 
concentrates 
in 
its 
hands 
all 
the 
threads 
of 
secret 
activities,

--Ed.). 
Apropos, 
we 
shall 
give 
another 
illustration 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
either 
does 
not 
understand 
what 
it 
is 
talking 
about 
or 
changes 
its 
views 
"with 
the 
wind." 
In 
No. 
1 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
we 
find 
the 
following 
passage 
in 
italics: 
"The 
sum 
and 
substance 
of 
the 
views 
expressed 
in 
this 
pamphlet 
coincide 
entirely 
with 
the 
editorial 
program 
of 
the 
'Rabocheye 
Dyelo.'" 
(P. 
142.) 
Is 

that 
so, 
indeed? 
Does 
the 
view 
that 
the 
mass 
movement 
must 
not 
be 
set 
the 
primary 
task 
of 
overthrowing 
the 
autocracy 
coincide 
with 
the 
views 
expressed 
in 
The 
Tasks 
of 
the 
Russian 
Social-Democrats? 
Do 
the 
theory 
of 
"the 
economic 
struggle 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government" 
and 
the 
stages 
theory 
coincide 
with 
the 
views 
expressed 
in 
that 
pamphlet? 
We 
leave 
it 
to 
the 
reader 
to 
judge 
whether 
an 
organ 
which 
understands 
the 
meaning 
of 
"coincidence" 
in 
this 
peculiar 
manner 
can 
have 
firm 
principles. 


sity 
is 
centralized, 
may 
too 
easily 
rush 
into 
a 
premature 
attack, 
may 
thoughtlessly 
intensify 
the 
movement 
before 
the 
growth 
of 
political 
discontent, 
the 
intensity 
of 
the 
ferment 
and 
anger 
of 
the 
working 
class, 
etc., 
have 
made 
such 
an 
attack 
possible 
and 
necessary. 
To 
this 
we 
reply: 
speaking 
abstractly, 
it 
cannot 
be 
denied, 
of 
course, 
that 
a 
militant 
organization 
may 
thoughtlessly 
commence 
a 
battle, 
which 
may 
end 
in 
defeat, 
that 
might 
have 
been 
avoided 
under 
other 
circumstances. 
But 
we 
cannot 
confine 
ourselves 
to 
abstract 
reasoning 
on 
such 
a 
question, 
because 
every 
battle 
bears 
within 
itself 
the 
abstract 
possibility 
of 
defeat, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
other 
way 
of 
reducing 
this 
possibility 
than 
by 
organized 
preparation 
for 
battle. 
If, 
however, 
we 
proceed 
from 
the 
concrete 
conditions 
at 
present 
prevailing 
in 
Russia, 
we 
must 
come 
to 
the 
positive 
conclusion 
that 
a 
strong 
revolutionary 
organization 
is 
absolutely 
necessary 
precisely 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
giving 
firmness 
to 
the 
movement, 
and 
of 
safeguarding 
it 
against 
the 
possibility 
of 
making 
premature 
attacks. 
It 
is 
precisely 
at 
the 
present 
time, 
when 
no 
such 
organization 
exists 
yet, 
and 
when 
the 
revolutionary 
movement 
is 
rapidly 
and 
spontaneously 
growing, 
that 
we 
already 
observe 
two 
opposite 
extremes 
(which, 
as 
is 
to 
be 
expected, 
"meet"), 
i.e., 
absolutely 
unsound 
Economism 
and 
the 
preaching 
of 
moderation, 
and 
equally 
unsound 
"excitative 
terror," 
which 
"strives 
artificially 
to 
call 
forth 
symptoms 
of 
its 
end 
in 
a 
movement 
which 
is 
developing 
and 
becoming 
strong, 
but 
which 
is 
as 
yet 
nearer 
to 
its 
beginning 
than 
to 
its 
end." 
(V. 
Zasulich, 
in 
the 
Zarya, 
No. 
2-3, 
p. 
353.) 
And 
the 
example 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
shows 
that 
there 
are 
already 
Social-Democrats 
who 
give 
way 
to 
both 
these 
extremes. 
This 
is 
not 
surprising 
because, 
apart 
from 
other 
reasons, 
the 
"economic 
struggle 
against 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
government" 
can 
never 
satisfy 


revolutionaries, 
and 
because 
opposite 
extremes 
will 
always 
arise 
here 
and 
there. 
Only 
a 
centralized, 
militant 
organization 
that 
consistently 
carries 
out 
a 
Social-Democratic 
policy, 
that 
satisfies, 
so 
to 
speak, 
all 
revolutionary 
instincts 
and 
strivings, 
can 
safeguard 
the 
movement 
against 
making 



thoughtless 
attacks 
and 
prepare 
attacks 
that 
hold 
out 
the 
promise 
of 
success. 


A 
further 
objection 
may 
be 
raised, 
viz., 
that 
the 
views 
on 
organization 
here 
expounded 
contradict 
the 
"principles 
of 
democracy." 
Now 
while 
the 
first-mentioned 
accusation 
was 
specifically 
Russian 
in 
origin, 
this 
one 
is 
specifically 
foreign 
in 
character. 
And 
only 
an 
organization 
abroad 
(the 
Union 
of 
Russian 
Social-Democrats) 
was 
capable 
of 
giving 
its 
editorial 
board 
instructions 
like 
the 
following: 


"Principles 
of 
Organization. 
In 
order 
to 
secure 
the 
successful 
development 
and 
unification 
of 
Social-Democracy, 
broad 
democratic 
principles 
of 
Party 
organization 
must 
be 
emphasized, 
developed 
and 
fought 
for; 
and 
this 
is 
particularly 
necessary 
in 
view 
of 
the 
antidemocratic 
tendencies 
that 
have 
become 
revealed 
in 
the 
ranks 
of 
our 
Party." 
(Two 
Congresses, 
p. 
18.) 


We 
shall 
see 
in 
the 
next 
chapter 
how 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
fights 
against 
the 
Iskra's 
"antidemocratic 
tendencies." 
For 
the 
present 
we 
shall 
examine 
more 
closely 
the 
"principle" 
that 
the 
Economists 
advance. 
Everyone 
will 
probably 
agree 
that 
"broad 
democratic 
principles" 
presuppose 
the 
two 
following 
conditions: 
first, 
full 
publicity, 
and 
second, 
election 
to 
all 
offices. 
It 
would 
be 
absurd 
to 
speak 
about 
democracy 
without 
publicity, 
that 
is, 
a 
publicity 
that 
is 
not 
limited 
to 
the 
membership 
of 
the 
organization. 
We 
call 
the 
German 
Socialist 
Party 
a 
democratic 
organization 
because 
all 
it 
does 
is 
done 
publicly; 
even 
its 
party 
congresses 
are 
held 
in 
public. 
But 
no 
one 
would 
call 
democratic 
an 
organization 
that 
is 
hidden 
from 
every 
one 
but 
its 
members 
by 
a 
veil 
of 
secrecy. 


What 
is 
the 
use, 
then, 
of 
advancing 
"broad 
democratic 
principles" 
when 
the 
fundamental 
condition 
for 
these 
principles 
cannot 
be 
fulfilled 
by 
a 
secret 
organization? 
"Broad 
principles" 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
a 
resonant 
but 
hollow 
phrase. 
More, 
it 
reveals 
a 
total 
lack 
of 
understanding 
of 
the 
urgent 
tasks 
in 
regard 
to 
organization. 
Everyone 
knows 
how 
great 
is 
the 
lack 
of 
secrecy 
among 
the 
"broad" 
masses 
of 
our 
revolutionaries. 
We 
have 
heard 
the 
bitter 
complaints 
of 
B-v 
on 
this 
score, 
and 
his 
absolutely 
just 
demand 
for 
a 
"strict 
selection 
of 
members." 
(Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No. 
6, 
p. 
42.) 
Yet, 
persons 
who 
boast 
a 
keen 
"sense 
of 
realities" 
urge, 
in 
a 
situation 
like 
this, 
not 
the 
strictest 
secrecy 
and 
the 
strictest 
(and 
therefore 
more 
restricted) 
selection 
of 
members 
but 
"broad 
democratic 
principles"! 
This 
is 
what 
we 
call 
being 
absolutely 
wide 
of 
the 
mark. 


Nor 
is 
the 
situation 
any 
better 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
second 
attribute 
of 



democracy, 
namely, 
the 
principle 
of 
election. 
In 
politically 
free 
countries, 
this 
condition 
is 
taken 
for 
granted. 
"Membership 
of 
the 
Party 
is 
open 
to 
those 
who 
accept 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
Party 
program 
and 
render 
the 
Party 
all 
possible 
support" 
--reads 
clause 
I 
of 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
German 
Social-Democratic 
Party. 
And 
as 
the 
entire 
political 
arena 
is 
as 
open 
to 
the 
public 
view 
as 
is 
a 
theatre 
stage 
to 
the 
audience, 
this 
acceptance 
or 
non-acceptance, 
support 
or 
opposition, 
is 
known 
to 
all 
from 
the 
press 
and 
public 
meetings. 
Everyone 
knows 
that 
a 
certain 
political 
figure 
began 
in 
such 
and 
such 
a 
way, 
passed 
through 
such 
and 
such 
an 
evolution, 
behaved 
in 
a 
trying 
moment 
in 
such 
and 
such 
a 
way 
and 
possesses 
such 
and 
such 
qualities 
and, 
consequently, 
all 
party 
members, 
knowing 
all 
the 
facts, 
can 
elect 
or 
refuse 
to 
elect 
this 
person 
to 
a 
particular 
party 
office. 
The 
universal 


control 
(in 
the 
literal 
sense 
of 
the 
term) 
exercised 
over 
every 
act 
of 
a 
party 
man 
in 
the 
political 
field 
brings 
into 
existence 
an 
automatically 
operating 
mechanism 
which 
produces 
what 
in 
biology 
is 
called 
"survival 
of 
the 
fittest." 
The 
"natural 
selection" 
by 
full 
publicity, 
election 
and 
universal 
control 
provides 
the 
guarantee 
that, 
in 
the 
last 
analysis, 
every 
political 
figure 
will 
be 
"in 
his 
proper 
place," 
will 
do 
the 
work 
for 
which 
he 
is 
best 
fitted 
by 
his 
capacity 
and 
abilities, 
will 
feel 
the 
effects 
of 
his 
mistakes 
on 
himself, 
and 
will 
prove 
before 
all 
the 
world 
his 
ability 
to 
recognize 
mistakes 
and 
to 
avoid 
them. 


Just 
try 
to 
put 
this 
picture 
into 
the 
frame 
of 
our 
autocracy! 
Is 
it 
conceivable 
in 
Russia 
for 
all 
those 
"who 
accept 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
Party 
program 
and 
render 
the 
Party 
all 
possible 
support" 
to 
control 
every 
action 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
working 
in 
secret? 
Is 
it 
possible 
for 
all 
the 
revolutionaries 
to 
elect 
one 
of 
their 
number 
to 
any 
particular 
office, 
when, 
in 
the 
very 
interests 
of 
the 
work, 
he 
must 
conceal 
his 
identity 
from 
nine 
out 
of 
ten 
of 
these 
"all"? 
Ponder 
a 
little 
over 
the 
real 
meaning 
of 
the 
high-sounding 
phrases 
to 
which 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
gives 
utterance, 
and 
you 
will 
realize 
that 
"broad 
democracy" 
in 
Party 
organization, 
amidst 
the 
gloom 
of 
the 
autocracy 
and 
the 
domination 
of 
gendarme 
selection, 
is 
nothing 
more 
than 
a 
useless 
and 
harmful 
toy. 
It 
is 
a 
useless 
toy 
because, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
no 
revolutionary 
organization 
has 
ever 
practised, 
or 
could 
practise, 
broad 
democracy, 
however 
much 
it 
desired 
to 
do 
so. 
It 
is 
a 
harmful 
toy 
because 
any 
attempt 
to 
practise 
the 
"broad 
democratic 
principles" 
will 
simply 
facilitate 
the 
work 
of 
the 
police 
in 
carrying 
out 
large-scale 
raids, 
it 
will 
perpetuate 
the 
prevailing 
amateurishness, 
divert 
the 
thoughts 



of 
the 
practical 
workers 
from 
the 
serious 
and 
imperative 
task 
of 
training 
themselves 
to 
become 
professional 
revolutionaries 
to 
that 
of 
drawing 
up 
detailed 
"paper" 
rules 
for 
election 
systems. 
Only 
abroad, 
where 
people 
who 
have 
no 
opportunity 
of 
doing 
real 
live 
work 
gather 
togethet 
very 
often, 
could 
this 
"playing 
at 
democracy" 
develop 
here 
and 
there, 
especially 
in 
various 
small 
groups. 


In 
order 
to 
show 
how 
implausible 
is 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo's 
favourite 
trick 
of 
advancing 
the 
plausible 
"principle" 
of 
democracy 
in 
revolutionary 
affairs, 
we 
shall 
again 
call 
a 
witness. 
This 
witness, 
E. 
Serebryakov, 
the 
editor 
of 
the 
London 
magazine, 
Nakanunye, 
has 
a 
tender 
feeling 
for 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
and 
is 
filled 
with 
great 
hatred 
for 
Plekhanov 
and 
the 
"Plekhanovites." 
In 
its 
articles 
on 
the 
split 
in 
the 
Union 
of 
Russian 
Social-Democrats 
Abroad, 
the 
Nakanunye 
definitely 
sided 
with 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
and 
poured 
a 
stream 
of 
abuse 
upon 
Plekhanov. 
All 
the 
more 
valuable, 
therefore, 
is 
this 
witness 
in 
the 
question 
at 
issue. 
In 
No. 
7 
of 
the 
Nakanunye 
(July 
1899), 
in 
an 
article 
entitled 
"The 
Manifesto 
of 
the 
Self-Emancipation 
of 
the 
Workers 
Group," 
E. 
Serebryakov 
argues 
that 
it 
was 
"indecent" 
to 
talk 
about 
such 
things 
as 
"self-deception, 
leadership 
and 
so-called 
Areopagus 
in 
a 
serious 
revolutionary 
movement" 
and, 
among 
other 
things, 
wrote: 


"Myshkin, 
Rogachov, 
Zhelyabov, 
Mikhailov, 
Perovskaya, 
Figner 
and 
others 
never 
regarded 
themselves 
as 
leaders, 
and 
no 
one 
ever 
elected 
or 
appointed 
them 
as 
such, 
although 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
they 
were 
leaders 
because, 
in 
the 
propaganda 
period, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
period 
of 
the 
fight 
against 
the 
government, 
they 
took 
the 
brunt 
of 
the 
work 
upon 
themselves, 
they 
went 
into 
the 
most 
dangerous 
places 
and 
their 
activities 
were 
the 
most 
fruitful. 
They 
became 
leaders 
not 
because 
they 
wished 
it, 
but 
because 
the 
comrades 
surrounding 
them 
had 
confidence 
in 
their 
wisdom, 
their 
energy 
and 
loyalty. 
To 
be 
afraid 
of 
some 
kind 
of 


Areopagus 
(if 
it 
is 
not 
feared, 
why 
write 
about 
it?) 
that 
would 
arbitrarily 
govern 
the 
movement 
is 
far 
too 
naïve. 
Who 
would 
obey 
it?'! 


We 
ask 
the 
reader, 
in 
what 
way 
does 
"Areopagus" 
differ 
from 
"antidemocratic 
tendencies"? 
And 
is 
it 
not 
evident 
that 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo's 
"plausible" 
organizational 
principle 
is 
equally 
naïve 
and 
indecent; 
naïve, 
because 
no 
one 
would 
obey 
"Areopagus," 
or 
people 
with 
"antidemocratic 
tendencies," 
if 
"the 
comrades 
surrounding 
them 
had" 
no 
"confidence 
in 
their 
wisdom, 
energy 
and 
loyalty"; 
indecent, 
because 
it 
is 
a 
demagogic 
sally 
calculated 
to 
play 
on 
the 
conceit 
of 
some, 
on 
the 
ignorance 
of 
others 



regarding 
the 
actual 
state 
of 
our 
movement, 
and 
on 
the 
lack 
of 
training 
and 
ignorance 
of 
the 
history 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
movement 
of 
still 
others. 
The 
only 
serious 
organizational 
principle 
for 
the 
active 
workers 
of 
our 
movement 
should 
be 
the 
strictest 
selection 
of 
members 
and 
the 
training 
of 
professlonal 
revolutionaries. 
Given 
these 
qualities, 
something 
even 
more 
than 
"democracy" 
would 
be 
guaranteed 
to 
us, 
namely, 
complete, 
comradely, 
mutual 
confidence 
among 
revolutionaries. 
And 
this 
is 
absolutely 
essential 
for 
us 
because 
there 
can 
be 
no 
question 
of 
replacing 
it 
by 
universal 
democratic 
control 
in 
Russia. 
And 
it 
would 
be 
a 
great 
mistake 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
establish 
real 
"democratic" 
control 
renders 
the 
members 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
organization 
beyond 
control 
altogether. 
They 
have 
not 
the 
time 
to 
think 
about 
the 
toy 
forms 
of 
democracy 
(democracy 
within 
a 
close 
and 
compact 
body 
of 
comrades 
in 
which 
complete, 
mutual 
confidence 
prevails), 
but 
they 
have 
a 
lively 
sense 
of 
their 
responsibility, 
knowing 
as 
they 
do 
from 
experience 
that 
an 
organization 
of 
real 
revolutionaries 
will 
stop 
at 
nothing 
to 
rid 
itself 
of 
an 
undesirable 
member. 
Moreover, 
there 
is 
a 
fairly 
well-developed 
public 
opinion 
in 


Russian 
(and 
international) 
revolutionary 
circles 
which 
has 
a 
long 
history 
behind 
it, 
and 
which 
sternly 
and 
ruthlessly 
punishes 
every 
departure 
from 
the 
duties 
of 
comradeship 
(and 
"democracy," 
real 
and 
not 
toy 
democracy, 
certainly 
forms 
a 
component 
part 
of 
the 
conception 
of 
comradeship). 
Take 
all 
this 
into 
consideration 
and 
you 
will 
realize 
that 
all 
this 
talk 
and 
these 
resolutions 
about 
"antidemocratic 
tendencies" 
have 
the 
musty 
smell 
of 
that 
playing 
at 
generalship 
which 
is 
indulged 
in 
abroad. 


It 
must 
be 
observed 
also 
that 
the 
other 
source 
of 
this 
talk, 
i.e., 
naïveté, 
is 
likewise 
fostered 
by 
the 
confusion 
of 
ideas 
concerning 
the 
meaning 
of 
democracy. 
In 
Mr. 
and 
Mrs. 
Webb's 
book 
on 
the 
British 
trade 
unions 
there 
is 
an 
interesting 
chapter 
entitled 
"Primitive 
Democracy." 
In 
it 
the 
authors 
relate 
how 
the 
British 
workers, 
in 
the 
first 
period 
of 
existence 
of 
their 
unions, 
thought 
that 
it 
was 
an 
indispensable 
sign 
of 
democracy 
for 
all 
the 
members 
to 
do 
all 
the 
work 
of 
managing 
the 
unions; 
not 
only 
were 
all 
questions 
decided 
by 
the 
vote 
of 
all 
the 
members, 
but 
all 
the 
official 
duties 
were 
fulfilled 
by 
all 
the 
members 
in 
turn. 
A 
long 
period 
of 
historical 
experience 
was 
required 
for 
workers 
to 
realize 
how 
absurd 
such 
a 
conception 
of 
democracy 
was 
and 
to 
make 
them 
understand 
the 
necessity 
for 
representative 
institutions, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
for 
full-time 
officials, 
on 
the 
other. 
Only 
after 
a 
number 
of 
cases 
of 
financial 
bankruptcy 
of 
trade 
unions 
occurred 
did 
the 
workers 
realize 
that 
the 



ratio 
between 
dues 
and 
benefits 
cannot 
be 
decided 
merely 
by 
a 
democratic 
vote, 
but 
requires 
also 
the 
advice 
of 
insurance 
experts. 
Take 
also 
Kautsky's 
book 
on 
parliamentarism 
and 
legislation 
by 
the 
people 
and 
you 
will 
see 
that 
the 
conclusions 
drawn 
by 
the 
Marxist 
theoretician 
coincide 


with 
the 
lessons 
learned 
from 
many 
years 
of 
practical 
experience 
by 
the 
workers 
who 
organized 
"spontaneously." 
Kautsky 
strongly 
protests 
against 
Rittinghausen's 
primitive 
conception 
of 
democracy; 
he 
ridicules 
those 
who 
in 
the 
name 
of 
democracy 
demand 
that 
"popular 
newspapers 
shall 
be 
directly 
edited 
by 
the 
people"; 
he 
shows 
the 
need 
for 
professional 
journalists, 
parliamentarians, 
etc., 
for 
the 
Social-Democratic 
leadership 
of 
the 
proletarian 
class 
struggle; 
he 
attacks 
the 
"Socialism 
of 
anarchists 
and 
litterateurs," 
who 
in 
their 
"striving 
after 
effect" 
extol 
direct 
legislation 
by 
the 
whole 
people, 
completely 
failing 
to 
understand 
that 
this 
idea 
can 
be 
only 
relatively 
applied 
in 
modern 
society. 


Those 
who 
have 
performed 
practical 
work 
in 
our 
movement 
know 
how 
widespread 
is 
the 
"primitive" 
conception 
of 
democracy 
among 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
students 
and 
workers. 
It 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
this 
conception 
penetrates 
into 
rules 
of 
organization 
and 
into 
literature. 
The 
Economists 
of 
the 
Bernstein 
persuasion 
included 
in 
their 
rules 
the 
following: 
"§10. 
All 
affairs 
affecting 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
union 
organization 
shall 
be 
decided 
by 
a 
majority 
vote 
of 
all 
its 
members." 
The 
Economists 
of 
the 
terrorist 
persuasion 
repeat 
after 
them: 
"The 
decisions 
of 
the 
committee 
shall 
become 
effective 
only 
after 
they 
have 
been 
circulated 
among 
all 
the 
circles." 
(Svoboda, 
No. 
1, 
p. 
67.) 
Observe 
that 
this 
proposal 
for 
a 
widely 
applied 
referendum 
is 
advanced 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
demand 
that 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
organization 
be 
built 
on 
an 
elective 
basis! 
We 
would 
not, 
of 
course, 
on 
this 
account 
condemn 
practical 
workers 
who 
have 
had 
too 
few 
opportunities 
for 
studying 
the 
theory 
and 
practice 
of 
real 
democratic 
organizations. 
But 
when 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
which 
lays 
claim 
to 
leadership, 
confines 
itself, 
under 
such 


conditions, 
to 
a 
resolution 
about 
broad 
democratic 
principles, 
can 
this 
be 
described 
other 
than 
a 
mere 
"striving 
after 
effect"? 



F. 
LOCAL 
AND 
ALL-RUSSIAN 
WORK 
The 
objections 
raised 
against 
the 
organization 
plan 
outlined 
here 
on 
the 
grounds 
that 
it 
is 
undemocratic 
and 
conspiratorial 
are 
totally 
unsound. 
Nevertheless, 
a 
question 
still 
remains 
which 
is 
frequently 
put 
and 
deserves 
detailed 
examination. 
This 
is 
the 
question 
about 
the 
relations 
between 
local 
work 
and 
all-Russian 
work. 
Fears 
are 
expressed 
that 
the 
formation 
of 
a 
centralized 
organization 
may 
shift 
the 
centre 
of 
gravity 
from 
the 
former 
to 
the 
latter, 
damage 
the 
movement, 
weaken 
our 
contacts 
with 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers 
and 
undermine 
local 
agitation 
generally. 
To 
these 
fears 
we 
reply 
that 
our 
movement 
in 
the 
past 
few 
years 
has 
suffered 
precisely 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
local 
workers 
have 
been 
too 
absorbed 
in 
local 
work; 
that 
therefore 
it 
is 
absolutely 
necessary 
to 
shift 
the 
centre 
of 
gravity 
somewhat 
to 
national 
work 
and 
that 
far 
from 
weakening, 
this 
would 
strengthen 
our 
ties 
and 
the 
continuity 
of 
our 
local 
agitation. 
Take 
the 
question 
of 
central 
and 
local 
newspapers. 
I 
would 
ask 
the 
reader 
not 
to 
forget 
that 
we 
cite 
the 
publication 
of 
newspapers 
only 
as 
an 
example, 
illustrating 
an 
immeasurably 
broader 
and 
more 
varied 
revolutionary 
activity 
in 
general. 


In 
the 
first 
period 
of 
the 
mass 
movement 
(1896-98), 
an 
attempt 
is 
made 
by 
local 
Party 
workers 
to 
publish 
an 
all-Russian 
paper, 
the 
Rabochaya 
Gazeta. 
In 
the 
next 
period 
(1898-1900), 
the 
movement 
makes 
an 
enormous 
stride, 
but 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
leaders 
is 
wholly 
absorbed 
by 
local 
publications. 
If 
we 
count 
up 
all 
the 
local 
papers 
that 
were 


published, 
we 
shall 
find 
that 
the 
average 
was 
one 
per 
month.[*] 
Does 
this 
not 
clearly 
illustrate 
our 
amateurishness? 
Does 
this 
not 
clearly 
show 
that 
our 
revolutionary 
organization 
lags 
behind 
the 
spontaneous 
growth 
of 
the 
movement? 
If 
the 
same 
number 
of 
issues 
had 
been 
published, 
not 
by 
scattered 
local 
groups, 
but 
by 
a 
single 
organization, 
we 
would 
not 
only 
have 
saved 
an 
enormous 
amount 
of 
effort, 
but 
we 
would 
have 
secured 
immeasurably 
greater 
stability 
and 
continuity 
in 
our 
work. 
This 
simple 
point 
is 
very 
frequently 
lost 
sight 
of 
by 
those 
practical 
workers 
who 
work 
actively 
and 
almost 
exclusively 
on 
local 
publications 
(unfortunately 
this 
is 
true 
even 
now 
in 
the 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
cases), 
as 
well 
as 
by 
the 
publicists 
who 
display 
an 
astonishing 
quixotism 
on 
this 
question. 
The 
practical 
workers 
usually 
rest 
content 
with 
the 
argument 
that 
"it 
is 
difficult"** 
for 
local 
workers 
to 
engage 
in 
the 
organization 
of 
an 
all-Russian 
newspaper, 
and 
that 
local 
newspapers 



are 
better 
than 
no 
newspapers 
at 
all. 
The 
latter 
argument 
is, 
of 
course, 
perfectly 
just, 
and 
we 
shall 
not 
yield 
to 
any 
practical 
worker 
in 
our 
recognition 
of 
the 
enormous 
importance 
and 
usefulness 
of 
local 
newspapers 
in 
general. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
the 
point. 
The 
point 
is, 
can 
we 
not 
overcome 
the 
scatteredness 
and 
amateurishness 
that 
are 
so 
glaringly 
expressed 
in 
the 
thirty 
issues 
of 
local 
newspapers 
published 
throughout 
Russia 
in 


* 
See 
Report 
fo 
the 
Paris 
Congress,[89] 
p. 
14. 
"From 
that 
time 
(1897) 
to 
the 
spring 
of 
1900, 
thirty 
issues 
of 
various 
papers 
were 
published 
in 
various 
places. 
. 
. 
. 
On 
an 
average, 
over 
one 
issue 
per 
month 
was 
published." 
** 
This 
difficulty 
is 
more 
apparent 
than 
real. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
there 
is 
not 
a 
single 
local 
circle 
but 
which 
has 
the 
opportunity 
of 
taking 
up 
some 
function 
or 
other 
in 
connection 
with 
all-Russian 
work. 
"Don't 
say: 
I 
can't; 
say: 
I 
won't." 


two 
and 
a 
half 
years? 
Do 
not 
restrict 
yourselves 
to 
the 
indisputable, 
but 
too 
general, 
statement 
about 
the 
usefulness 
of 
local 
newspapers 
generally; 
have 
the 
courage 
also 
frankly 
to 
admit 
their 
negative 
aspects 
that 
have 
been 
revealed 
by 
the 
experience 
of 
two 
and 
a 
half 
years. 
This 
experience 
has 
shown 
that 
under 
the 
conditions 
in 
which 
we 
work, 
these 
local 
newspapers 
prove, 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
cases, 
to 
be 
unstable 
in 
their 
principles, 
lacking 
in 
political 
significance, 
extremely 
costly 
in 
regard 
to 
expenditure 
of 
revolutionary 
forces, 
and 
totally 
unsatisfactory 
from 
a 
technical 
point 
of 
view 
(I 
have 
in 
mind, 
of 
course, 
not 
the 
technique 
of 
printing 
them, 
but 
the 
frequency 
and 
regularity 
of 
publication). 
These 
defects 
are 
not 
accidental; 
they 
are 
the 
inevitable 
outcome 
of 
the 
scatteredness 
which, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
explains 
the 
predominance 
of 
local 
newspapers 
in 
the 
period 
under 
review, 
and, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
is 
fostered 
by 
this 
predominance. 
It 
is 
positively 
beyond 
the 
strength 
of 
a 
separate 
local 
organization 
to 
maintain 
stability 
of 
principles 
in 
its 
newspaper 
and 
raise 
it 
to 
the 
level 
of 
a 
political 
organ; 
it 
is 
beyond 
its 
strength 
to 
collect 
and 
utilize 
sufficient 
material 
to 
cast 
light 
on 
the 
whole 
of 
our 
political 
life. 
The 
argument 
usually 
advanced 
to 
support 
the 
need 
of 
numerous 
local 
newspapers 
in 
free 
countries 
that 
the 
cost 
of 
printing 
by 
local 
workers 
is 
low 
and 
that 
the 
population 
can 
be 
kept 
more 
fully 
and 
quickly 
informed, 
this 
argument, 
as 
experience 
has 
shown, 
speaks 
against 
local 
newspapers 
in 
Russia. 
They 
are 
excessively 
costly 
in 
regard 
to 
expenditure 
of 
revolutionary 
forces, 
and 
appear 
very 
rarely, 
for 
the 
very 
simple 
reason 
that 
the 
publication 
of 
an 
illegal 
newspaper, 
no 
matter 



how 
small 
its 
size, 
requires 
an 
extensive 
secret 
apparatus 
such 
as 
is 
possible 
with 
large 
factory 
production; 
for 
this 
apparatus 
cannot 
be 
created 
in 
a 
small, 
handicraft 


workshop. 
Very 
frequently, 
the 
primitiveness 
of 
the 
secret 
apparatus 
(every 
practical 
worker 
can 
cite 
numerous 
cases) 
enables 
the 
police 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
publication 
and 
distribution 
of 
one 
or 
two 
issues 
to 
make 
mass 
arrests, 
which 
result 
in 
such 
a 
cleanup 
that 
it 
becomes 
necessary 
to 
start 
all 
over 
again. 
A 
well-organized 
secret 
apparatus 
requires 
professionally 
well-trained 
revolutionaries 
and 
division 
of 
labour 
applied 
with 
the 
greatest 
consistency, 
but 
both 
of 
these 
requirements 
are 
beyond 
the 
strength 
of 
a 
separate 
local 
organization, 
no 
matter 
how 
strong 
it 
may 
be 
at 
any 
given 
moment. 
Not 
only 
are 
the 
general 
interests 
of 
our 
movement 
as 
a 
whole 
(training 
of 
the 
workers 
in 
consistent 
socialist 
and 
political 
principles) 
better 
served 
by 
non-local 
newspapers, 
but 
so 
also 
are 
even 
specifically 
local 
interests. 
This 
may 
seem 
paradoxical 
at 
first 
sight, 
but 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
up 
to 
the 
hilt 
by 
the 
two 
and 
a 
half 
years 
of 
experience 
to 
which 
we 
have 
already 
referred. 
Everyone 
will 
agree 
that 
if 
all 
the 
local 
forces 
that 
were 
engaged 
in 
the 
publication 
of 
these 
thirty 
issues 
of 
newspapers 
had 
worked 
on 
a 
single 
newspaper, 
sixty 
if 
not 
a 
hundred 
issues 
could 
easily 
have 
been 
published 
and, 
consequently, 
it 
would 
have 
more 
fully 
expressed 
all 
the 
specifically 
local 
features 
of 
the 
movement 
True, 
it 
is 
not 
an 
easy 
matter 
to 
attain 
such 
a 
degree 
of 
organization, 
but 
we 
must 
realize 
the 
need 
for 
it. 
Every 
local 
circle 
must 
think 
about 
it, 
and 
work 
actively 
to 
achieve 
it, 
without 
waiting 
to 
be 
urged 
on 
from 
outside, 
without 
being 
tempted 
by 
the 
popularity 
and 
closer 
proximity 
of 
a 
local 
newspaper 
which, 
as 
our 
revolutionary 
experience 
has 
shown, 
proves 
to 
a 
large 
extent 
to 
be 
illusory. 


And 
it 
is 
a 
bad 
service 
indeed 
those 
publicists 
render 
to 
the 
practical 
work 
who, 
thinking 
that 
they 
are 
particularly 
close 
to 
the 
practical 
workers, 
fail 
to 
see 
this 
illusoriness, 


and 
make 
shift 
with 
the 
astonishingly 
hollow 
argument: 
we 
must 
have 
local 
newspapers, 
we 
must 
have 
district 
newspapers, 
and 
we 
must 
have 
all-
Russian 
newspapers. 
Generally 
speaking, 
of 
course, 
all 
these 
are 
necessary, 
but 
once 
you 
undertake 
to 
solve 
a 
concrete 
organizational 
problem 
surely 
you 
must 
take 
time 
and 
circumstances 
into 
consideration. 
Is 
it 
not 
quixotic 
when 
the 
Svoboda 
(No. 
1, 
p. 
68), 
in 
a 
special 
article 
"dealing 
with 
the 
question 
of 
a 
newspaper," 
writes: 
"It 
seems 
to 
us 
that 
every 
locality, 
where 
any 
appreciable 
number 
of 
workers 
are 
collected, 
should 
have 
its 
own 
workers' 
newspaper; 



not 
a 
newspaper 
imported 
from 
somewhere, 
but 
its 
very 
own." 
If 
the 
publicist 
who 
wrote 
these 
words 
refuses 
to 
think 
about 
their 
meaning, 
then 
at 
least 
you, 
reader, 
think 
about 
it 
for 
him. 
How 
many 
scores, 
if 
not 
hundreds, 
of 
"localities 
where 
any 
appreciable 
number 
of 
workers 
are 
collected" 
are 
there 
in 
Russia, 
and 
would 
it 
not 
be 
simply 
perpetuating 
our 
amateurishness 
if 
indeed 
every 
local 
organization 
set 
to 
work 
to 
publish 
its 
own 
newspaper? 
How 
this 
diffusion 
would 
facilitate 
the 
task 
of 
the 
gendarmes 
of 
netting 
--and 
without 
"any 
appreciable" 
effort 
--the 
local 
Party 
workers 
at 
the 
very 
outset 
of 
their 
activity 
and 
preventing 
them 
from 
developing 
into 
real 
revolutionaries! 
A 
reader 
of 
an 
all-Russian 
newspaper, 
continues 
the 
author, 
would 
not 
find 
at 
all 
interesting 
the 
descriptions 
of 
the 
malpractices 
of 
the 
factory 
owners 
and 
the 
"details 
of 
factory 
life 
in 
other 
towns 
outside 
his 
own." 
But 
"an 
inhabitant 
of 
Orel 
would 
not 
find 
it 
dull 
reading 
about 
Orel 
affairs. 
In 
every 
issue 
he 
would 
learn 
of 
who 
had 
been 
'called 
over 
the 
coals' 
and 
who 
had 
been 
'scolded,' 
and 
his 
spirits 
would 
begin 
to 
soar." 
(P. 
69.) 
Yes, 
yes, 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
Orel 
reader 
is 
soaring 
but 
the 
flights 
of 
imagination 
of 
our 
publicist 
are 
also 
soaring 
--too 
high. 
He 
should 


have 
asked 
himself: 
is 
such 
a 
defence 
of 
petty 
parochialism 
in 
place? 
We 
are 
second 
to 
none 
in 
our 
appreciation 
of 
the 
importance 
and 
necessity 
of 
factory 
exposures, 
but 
it 
must 
be 
borne 
in 
mind 
that 
we 
have 
reached 
a 
stage 
when 
St. 
Petersburg 
folk 
find 
it 
dull 
reading 
the 
St. 
Petersburg 
correspondence 
of 
the 
St. 
Petersburg 
Rabochaya 
Mysl. 
Local 
factory 
exposures 
have 
always 
been 
and 
should 
allways 
continue 
to 
be 
made 
through 
the 
medium 
of 
leaflets, 
but 
we 
must 
raise 
the 
level 
of 
the 
newspaper, 
and 
not 
lower 
it 
to 
the 
level 
of 
a 
factory 
leaflet. 
What 
we 
require 
for 
a 
newspaper 
is 
not 
so 
much 
"petty" 
exposures, 
as 
of 
the 
major, 
typical 
evils 
of 
factory 
life, 
exposures 
based 
on 
especially 
striking 
facts 
and 
capable, 
therefore, 
of 
arousing 
the 
interest 
of 
all 
workers 
and 
all 
leaders 
of 
the 
movement, 
capable 
of 
really 
enriching 
their 
knowledge, 
widening 
their 
outlook, 
and 
of 
serving 
as 
a 
starting 
point 
for 
awakening 
new 
districts 
and 
new 
categories 
of 
the 
workers. 


"Moreover, 
in 
a 
local 
newspaper, 
all 
the 
malpractices 
of 
the 
factory 
administration 
and 
other 
authorities 
may 
be 
denounced 
hot 
on 
the 
spot. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
a 
general 
newspaper, 
however, 
by 
the 
time 
the 
news 
reaches 
it 
the 
facts 
will 
have 
been 
forgotten 
in 
the 
localities 
in 
which 
they 
occurred. 
The 
reader, 
when 
he 
gets 
the 
paper, 
will 
say: 
'God 
knows 
when 
that 
happened!' 
" 
(Ibid.) 
Exactly! 
God 
knows 
when 
it 
happened. 
From 
the 
same 
source 
we 



learn 
that 
the 
30 
issues 
of 
newspapers 
which 
appeared 
in 
two 
and 
a 
half 
years, 
were 
published 
in 
six 
cities. 
This, 
on 
the 
average, 
is 
one 
issue 
per 
city 
per 
half 
year! 
And 
even 
if 
our 
frivolous 
publicist 
trebled 
his 
estimate 
of 
the 
productivity 
of 
local 
work 
(which 
would 
be 
absolutely 
wrong 
in 
the 
case 
of 
an 
average 
city, 
because 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
increase 
productivity 
to 
any 
extent 
by 
our 
amateurish 
methods), 


we 
would 
still 
get 
only 
one 
issue 
every 
two 
months, 
i.e., 
nothing 
at 
all 
like 
"denouncing 
hot 
on 
the 
spot." 
It 
would 
be 
sufficient, 
however, 
to 
combine 
ten 
or 
so 
local 
organizations, 
and 
send 
their 
delegates 
to 
take 
an 
active 
part 
in 
organizing 
a 
general 
newspaper, 
to 
enable 
us 
every 
fortnight 
to 
"denounce," 
over 
the 
whole 
of 
Russia, 
not 
petty, 
but 
really 
outstanding 
and 
typical 
evils. 
No 
one 
who 
knows 
the 
state 
of 
affairs 
in 
our 
organizations 
can 
have 
the 
slightest 
doubt 
on 
that 
score. 
As 
for 
catching 
the 
enemy 
red-handed 
--if 
we 
mean 
it 
seriously 
and 
not 
merely 
as 
a 
trite 
phrase 
--that 
is 
quite 
beyond 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
illegal 
paper 
generally. 
It 
can 
only 
be 
done 
by 
an 
anonymous 
leaflet, 
because 
exposures 
of 
that 
nature 
must 
be 
made 
within 
a 
day 
or 
two 
at 
the 
most 
(take, 
for 
example, 
the 
usual 
brief 
strikes, 
beatings 
in 
a 
factory, 
demonstrations, 
etc.). 


"The 
workers 
live 
not 
only 
in 
factories, 
but 
in 
the 
cities 
too," 
continues 
our 
author, 
rising 
from 
the 
particular 
to 
the 
general, 
with 
a 
strict 
consistency 
that 
would 
have 
done 
honour 
to 
Boris 
Krichevsky 
himself; 
and 
he 
refers 
to 
matters 
like 
municipal 
councils, 
municipal 
hospitals, 
municipal 
schools, 
and 
demands 
that 
workers' 
newspapers 
should 
not 
ignore 
municipal 
affairs 
in 
general. 
This 
demand 
--an 
excellent 
one 
in 
itself 
--serves 
as 
a 
particularly 
vivid 
illustration 
of 
the 
empty 
abstraction 
to 
which 
discussions 
about 
local 
newspapers 
are 
all 
too 
frequently 
limited. 
First 
of 
all, 
if 
indeed 
newspapers 
appeared 
"in 
every 
locality 
where 
any 
appreciable 
number 
of 
workers 
are 
collected" 
with 
such 
detailed 
information 
on 
municipal 
affairs 
as 
the 
Svoboda 
desires, 
it 
would, 
under 
our 
Russian 
conditions, 
inevitably 
degenerate 
into 
actual 
petty 
parochialism, 
would 
lead 
to 
a 
weakening 
of 
the 
consciousness 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
an 
all-Russian 
revolutionary 
onslaught 
on 
the 
tsarist 
autocracy, 
and 


would 
strengthen 
those 
extremely 
virile 
shoots 
--not 
uprooted 
but 
rather 
hidden 
or 
temporarily 
suppressed 
--of 
the 
tendency 
which 
has 
already 
become 
notorious 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
famous 
remark 
about 
revolutionaries 
who 
talk 
a 
great 
deal 
about 
non-existent 
parliaments 
and 
too 
little 
about 
existing 
municipal 
councils. 
We 
say 
"inevitably" 
in 
order 
to 
emphasize 
that 



the 
Svoboda 
obviously 
does 
not 
want 
this 
but 
the 
contrary 
to 
happen. 
But 
good 
intentions 
are 
not 
enough. 
In 
order 
that 
municipal 
affairs 
may 
be 
dealt 
with 
in 
their 
proper 
perspective, 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
our 
work, 
this 
perspective 
must 
first 
be 
clearly 
conceived, 
firmly 
established, 
not 
only 
by 
argument, 
but 
by 
numerous 
examples, 
so 
that 
it 
may 
acquire 
the 
stability 
of 
a 
tradition. 
This 
is 
far 
from 
being 
the 
case 
with 
us 
yet. 
And 
yet 
this 
must 
be 
done 
first, 
before 
we 
can 
allow 
ourselves 
to 
think 
and 
talk 
about 
an 
extensive 
local 
press. 


Secondly, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
write 
really 
well 
and 
interestingly 
about 
municipal 
affairs, 
one 
must 
have 
first-hand 
and 
not 
book 
knowledge 
of 
them. 
But 
there 
are 
hardly 
any 
Social-Democrats 
anywhere 
in 
Russia 
who 
possess 
that 
knowledge. 
In 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
write 
in 
newspapers 
(not 
in 
popular 
pamphlets) 
about 
municipal 
and 
state 
affairs 
one 
must 
have 
fresh 
and 
multifarious 
material 
collected 
and 
worked 
up 
by 
able 
people. 
And 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
collect 
and 
work 
up 
such 
material, 
we 
must 
have 
something 
more 
than 
the 
"primitive 
democracy" 
of 
a 
primitive 
circle, 
in 
which 
everybody 
does 
everything 
and 
all 
entertain 
themselves 
by 
playing 
at 
referendums. 
For 
this 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
have 
a 
staff 
of 
expert 
writers, 
expert 
correspondents, 
an 
army 
of 
Social-Democratic 
reporters 
who 
establish 
contacts 
far 
and 
wide, 
able 
to 
fathom 
all 
sorts 
of 
"state 
secrets" 


(about 
which 
the 
Russian 
government 
official 
is 
so 
puffed 
up, 
but 
which 
he 
so 
easily 
blabs), 
able 
to 
penetrate 
"behind 
the 
scenes," 
an 
army 
of 
people 
whose 
"official 
duty" 
it 
must 
be 
to 
be 
ubiquitous 
and 
omniscient. 
And 
we, 
the 
Party 
that 
fights 
against 
all 
economic, 
political, 
social 
and 
national 
oppression, 
can 
and 
must 
find, 
collect, 
train, 
mobilize 
and 
set 
into 
motion 
such 
an 
army 
of 
omniscient 
people 
--but 
all 
this 
has 
yet 
to 
be 
done! 
Far 
from 
taking 
a 
single 
step 
in 
this 
direction 
in 
the 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
localities, 
the 
necessity 
for 
doing 
it 
is 
very 
often 
not 
even 
realized. 
Search 
our 
Social-Democratic 
press 
for 
lively 
and 
interesting 
articles, 
correspondence, 
and 
exposures 
of 
our 
diplomatic, 
military, 
ecclesiastical, 
municipal, 
financial, 
etc., 
etc., 
affairs 
and 
malpractices! 
You 
will 
find 
almost 
nothing, 
or 
very 
little, 
about 
these 
things.* 
That 
is 
why 
"it 
always 
frightfully 
annoys 
me 
when 
a 
man 
comes 
to 
me, 
utters 
beautiful 
and 
charming 
words" 
about 
the 
need 
for 
newspapers 
in 
"every 
locality 
where 
any 
appreciable 
number 
of 
workers 
are 
collected" 
that 
will 
expose 
factory, 
municipal 
and 
government 
evils. 


* 
That 
is 
why 
even 
examples 
of 
exceptionally 
good 
local 
newspapers 
fully 
confirm 
our 
point 
of 
view. 
For 
example, 
the 
Yuzhny 
Rabochy 
is 
an 

excellent 
newspaper, 
and 
is 
altogether 
free 
from 
instability 
of 
principles. 
But 
it 
has 
been 
unable 
to 
provide 
what 
it 
desired 
for 
the 
local 
movement, 
owing 
to 
the 
infrequency 
of 
its 
publication 
and 
to 
extensive 
police 
raids. 
What 
our 
Party 
most 
urgently 
requires 
at 
the 
present 
time, 
viz., 
a 
principled 
discussion 
of 
the 
fundamental 
questions 
of 
the 
movement 
and 
wide 
political 
agitation, 
has 
proved 
too 
big 
a 
job 
for 
the 
local 
newspaper. 
And 
what 
material 
of 
particular 
value 
it 
has 
published, 
like 
the 
articles 
about 
the 
mine 
owners' 
congress, 
unemployment, 
etc., 
was 
not 
strictly 
local 
material, 
it 
was 
required 
for 
the 
whole 
of 
Russia, 
and 
not 
for 
the 
South 
alone. 
No 
articles 
like 
that 
have 
appeared 
in 
any 
of 
our 
Social-Democratic 
newspapers. 


The 
predominance 
of 
the 
local 
papers 
over 
a 
central 
press 
may 
be 
a 
sign 
either 
of 
poverty 
or 
of 
luxury. 
Of 
poverty, 
when 
the 
movement 
has 
not 
yet 
developed 
the 
forces 
for 
large-scale 
production, 
continues 
to 
flounder 
in 
amateurishness 
and 
is 
all 
but 
swamped 
with 
"the 
petty 
details 
of 
factory 
life." 
Of 
luxury, 
when 
the 
movement 
has 
already 
fully 
mastered 
the 
task 
of 
comprehensive 
exposure 
and 
comprehensive 
agitation 
and 
it 
becomes 
necessary 
to 
publish 
numerous 
local 
newspapers 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
central 
organ. 
Let 
each 
one 
decide 
for 
himself 
what 
the 
predominance 
of 
local 
newspapers 
implies 
at 
the 
present 
time. 
I 
shall 
limit 
myself 
to 
a 
precise 
formulation 
of 
my 
own 
conclusion 
in 
order 
not 
to 
furnish 
grounds 
for 
misunderstanding. 
Hitherto, 
the 
majority 
of 
our 
local 
organizations 
have 
been 
thinking 
almost 
exclusively 
of 
local 
newspapers, 
and 
have 
devoted 
almost 
all 
their 
activities 
to 
these. 
This 
is 
abnormal 
--the 
very 
opposite 
should 
be 
the 
case. 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
local 
organizations 
should 
think 
principally 
of 
the 
publication 
of 
an 
all-Russian 
newspaper, 
and 
devote 
their 
activities 
principally 
to 
it. 
Until 
this 
is 
done, 
we 
shall 
not 
be 
able 
to 
establish 
a 
single 
newspaper 
capable, 
to 
any 
degree, 
of 
serving 
the 
movement 
with 
comprehensive 
press 
agitation. 
When 
it 
is 
done, 
however, 
normal 
relations 
between 
the 
necessary 
central 
newspapers 
and 
the 
necessary 
local 
newspapers 
will 
be 
established 
automatically. 


*** 


It 
would 
seem 
at 
first 
glance 
that 
the 
conclusion 
concerning 
the 
necessity 
for 
shifting 
the 
centre 
of 
gravity 
from 
local 
work 
to 
all-Russian 
work 
does 
not 
apply 
to 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
specifically 
economic 
struggle, 
In 
this 
stuggle, 
the 
im


mediate 
enemy 
of 
the 
workers 
is 
the 
individual 
employer 
or 
group 
of 



employers, 
who 
are 
not 
bound 
by 
any 
organization 
having 
even 
the 
remotest 
resemblance 
to 
the 
purely 
military, 
strictly 
centralized 
organization 
of 
the 
Russian 
government 
which 
is 
guided 
even 
in 
its 
minutest 
details 
by 
a 
single 
will, 
and 
which 
is 
our 
immediate 
enemy 
in 
the 
political 
struggle. 


But 
that 
is 
not 
the 
case. 
As 
we 
have 
already 
pointed 
out 
time 
and 
again, 
the 
economic 
struggle 
is 
a 
trade 
struggle, 
and 
for 
that 
reason 
it 
requires 
that 
the 
workers 
be 
organized 
according 
to 
trade 
and 
not 
only 
according 
to 
their 
place 
of 
employment. 
And 
this 
organization 
by 
trade 
becomes 
all 
the 
more 
imperatively 
necessary, 
the 
more 
rapidly 
our 
employers 
organize 
in 
all 
sorts 
of 
companies 
and 
syndicates. 
Our 
scatteredness 
and 
our 
amateurishness 
are 
an 
outright 
hindrance 
to 
this 
work 
of 
organization 
which 
requires 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
single, 
all-Russian 
body 
of 
revolutionaries 
which 
is 
capable 
of 
giving 
leadership 
to 
the 
all-Russian 
trade 
unions. 
We 
have 
already 
described 
above 
the 
type 
of 
organization 
that 
is 
desired 
for 
this 
purpose, 
and 
now 
we 
shall 
add 
just 
a 
few 
words 
about 
this 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
question 
of 
our 
press. 


That 
every 
Social-Democratic 
newspaper 
must 
have 
a 
special 
section 
devoted 
to 
the 
trade 
union 
(economic) 
struggle 
hardly 
anyone 
will 
doubt. 
But 
the 
growth 
of 
the 
trade 
union 
movement 
compels 
us 
to 
think 
also 
about 
a 
trade 
union 
press. 
It 
seems 
to 
us, 
however, 
that 
with 
rare 
exceptions, 
there 
can 
be 
no 
question 
of 
trade 
union 
newspapers 
in 
Russia 
at 
the 
present 
time; 
they 
would 
be 
a 
luxury, 
and 
many 
a 
time 
we 
lack 
even 
our 
daily 
bread. 
The 
form 
of 
trade 
union 
press 
that 
would 
suit 
the 
conditions 
of 
our 
illegal 
work 
and 
is 
already 
required 
at 
the 
present 
time 
is 
trade 
union 
pam


phlets. 
In 
these 
pamphlets, 
legal* 
and 
illegal 
material 
should 
be 
collected 
and 
grouped 
systematically, 
on 
conditions 
of 
labour 
in 
a 
given 
trade, 
on 
the 
differences 
in 
this 
regard 
in 
the 
various 
parts 
of 
Russia, 
the 
principal 
demands 
advanced 
by 
the 
workers 
in 
a 
given 
trade, 
the 
defects 
of 
the 
laws 
concerning 
that 
trade, 
outstanding 
cases 
of 
economic 
struggle 
by 
the 
workers 
in 
this 
trade, 
on 
the 
rudiments, 
the 
present 
state 
and 
the 
requirements 
of 
their 
trade 
union 
organization, 
etc. 
Such 
pamphlets 
would, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
relieve 
our 
Social-Democratic 
press 
of 
a 
mass 
of 
trade 
details 
that 
are 
of 
interest 
only 
to 
the 
workers 
of 
the 
given 
trade; 
secondly, 


* 
Legal 
material 
is 
particularly 
important 
in 
this 
connection, 
and 
we 
are 
particularly 
behind 
in 
our 
ability 
systematically 
to 
collect 
and 
utilize 
it. 
It 
would 
not 
be 
an 
exaggeration 
to 
say 
that 
one 
could 
somehow 
compile 
a 
trade 
union 
pamphlet 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
legal 
material 
alone, 
but 
it 
could 
not 
be 
done 

on 
the 
basis 
of 
illegal 
material 
alone. 
In 
collecting 
illegal 
material 
from 
workers 
on 
questions 
like 
those 
dealt 
with 
in 
the 
publications 
of 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl, 
we 
waste 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
the 
efforts 
of 
revolutionaries 
(whose 
place 
in 
this 
work 
could 
very 
easily 
be 
taken 
by 
legal 
workers), 
and 
yet 
we 
never 
obtain 
good 
material. 
The 
reason 
is 
that 
a 
worker 
who 
very 
often 
knows 
only 
a 
single 
department 
of 
a 
large 
factory 
and 
almost 
always 
the 
economic 
results, 
but 
not 
the 
general 
conditions 
and 
standards 
of 
his 
work, 
cannot 
acquire 
the 
knowledge 
which 
is 
possessed 
by 
the 
office 
staff 
of 
a 
factory, 
by 
inspectors, 
doctors, 
etc., 
and 
which 
is 
scattered 
in 
petty 
newspaper 
reports, 
and 
in 
special 
industrial, 
medical, 
Zemstvo 
and 
other 
publications. 
I 
very 
distinctly 
remember 
my 
"first 
experiment," 
which 
I 
would 
never 
like 
to 
repeat. 
I 
spent 
many 
weeks 
"examining" 
a 
worker 
who 
used 
to 
visit 
me, 
about 
every 
aspect 
of 
the 
conditions 
prevailing 
in 
the 
enormous 
factory 
at 
which 
he 
was 
employed. 
True, 
after 
great 
effort, 
I 
managed 
to 
obtain 
material 
for 
a 
description 
(of 
just 
one 
single 
factory!), 
but 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
interview 
the 
worker 
would 
wipe 
the 
sweat 
from 
his 
brow 
and 
say 
to 
me 
smilingly: 
"I 
find 
it 
easier 
to 
work 
overtime 
than 
answer 
your 
questions!" 
The 
more 
energetically 
we 
carry 
on 
our 
revolutionary 
struggle, 
the 
more 
the 
government 
will 
be 
compelled 
to 
legalize 
a 
part 
of 
the 
"trade 
union" 
work, 
thereby 
relieving 
us 
of 
part 
of 
our 
burden. 


they 
would 
record 
the 
results 
of 
our 
experience 
in 
the 
trade 
union 
struggle, 
would 
preserve 
the 
material 
collected 
--which 
now 
literally 
gets 
lost 
in 
a 
mass 
of 
leaflets 
and 
fragmentary 
correspondence 
--and 
would 
generalize 
this 
material. 
Thirdly, 
they 
could 
serve 
as 
material 
for 
the 
guidance 
of 
agitators, 
because 
conditions 
of 
labour 
change 
relatively 
slowly 
and 
the 
principal 
demands 
of 
the 
workers 
in 
a 
given 
trade 
are 
extremely 
stable 
(cf., 
for 
example, 
the 
demands 
advanced 
by 
the 
weavers 
in 
the 
Moscow 
district 
in 
1885 
and 
in 
the 
St. 
Petersburg 
district 
in 
1896); 
a 
compilation 
of 
these 
demands 
and 
needs 
might 
serve 
for 
years 
as 
an 
excellent 
handbook 
for 
agitators 
on 
economic 
questions 
in 
backward 
localities 
or 
among 
the 
backward 
strata 
of 
the 
workers. 
Examples 
of 
successful 
strikes, 
information 
about 
the 
higher 
standard 
of 
living, 
about 
better 
conditions 
of 
labour 
in 
one 
district, 
would 
encourage 
the 
workers 
in 
other 
districts 
to 
take 
up 
the 
fight 
again 
and 
again. 
Fourthly, 
having 
made 
a 
start 
in 
generalizing 
the 
trade 
union 
struggle, 
and 
having 
in 
this 
way 
strengthened 
the 
link 
between 
the 
Russian 
trade 
union 
movement 
and 
Socialism, 
the 
Social-Democrats 
would 
at 
the 
same 
time 
see 
to 
it 
that 
our 
trade 
union 
work 
did 
not 
take 
up 
either 
too 
small 



or 
too 
large 
a 
part 
of 
our 
entire 
Social-Democratic 
work. 
A 
local 
organization 
that 
is 
cut 
off 
from 
the 
organizations 
in 
other 
towns 
finds 
it 
very 
difficult, 
and 
sometimes 
almost 
impossible, 
to 
maintain 
a 
correct 
sense 
of 
proportion 
(and 
the 
example 
of 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
shows 
what 
a 
monstrous 
exaggeration 
can 
be 
made 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
trade 
unionism). 
But 
an 
all-Russian 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries 
that 
stands 
undeviatingly 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
Marxism, 
that 
leads 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
political 
struggle 
and 
possesses 
a 
staff 
of 
professional 
agitators, 
will 
never 
find 
it 
difficult 
to 
determine 
the 
proper 
proportion. 



V. 
The 
"Plan" 
For 
An 
All-Russian 
Political 
Newspaper 

"The 
most 
serious 
blunder 
the 
Iskra 
committed 
in 
this 
connection," 
writcs 
B. 
Krichevsky 
(Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No. 
10, 
p. 
30) 
--accusing 
us 
of 
betraying 
a 
tendency 
to 
"convert 
theory 
into 
a 
lifeless 
doctrine 
by 
isolating 
it 
from 
practice" 
--"was 
in 
promoting 
its 
'plan' 
for 
a 
general 
party 
organization" 
(i.e., 
the 
article 
entitled 
"Where 
To 
Begin?"[90]). 
And 
Martynov 
echoes 
this 
idea 
by 
declaring 
that 
"Iskra's 
tendency 
to 
belittle 
the 
forward 
march 
of 
the 
drab 
everyday 
struggle 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
propaganda 
of 
brilliant 
and 
complete 
ideas 
. 
. 
. 
was 
crowned 
by 
the 
plan 
for 
the 
organization 
of 
a 
party 
which 
it 
sets 
forth 
in 
an 
article 
in 
No. 
4, 
entitled 
'Where 
To 
Begin?'" 
(Ibid., 
p. 
61.) 
Lastly, 
quite 
recently, 
L. 
Nadezhdin 
joined 
in 
the 
chorus 
of 
indignation 
against 
this 
"plan" 
(the 
quotation 
marks 
were 
meant 
to 
express 
sarcasm). 
In 
his 
pamphlet 
we 
have 
just 
received, 
entitled 
The 
Eve 
of 
Revolution 
(published 
by 
the 
Revolutionary-Socialist 
Group 
Svoboda, 
whose 
acquaintance 
we 
have 
already 
made), 
he 
declares: 
"To 
speak 
now 
of 
an 
organization 
linked 


up 
with 
an 
all-Russian 
newspaper 
means 
propagating 
armchair 
ideas 
and 
armchair 
work" 
(p. 
126), 
that 
it 
is 
a 
manifestation 
of 
"literariness," 
etc. 


That 
our 
terrorist 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
in 
agreement 
with 
the 
champions 
of 
the 
"forward 
march 
of 
the 
drab 
everyday 
struggle," 
is 
not 
surprising, 
since 
we 
have 
traced 
the 
roots 
of 
this 
intimacy 
between 
them 
in 
the 
chapters 
on 
politics 
and 
organization. 
But 
we 
must 
draw 
attention 
here 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
L. 
Nadezhdin 
is 
the 
only 
one 
who 
has 
conscientiously 
tried 
to 
grasp 
the 
train 
of 
thought 
in 
an 
article 
he 
disliked, 
and 
has 
made 
an 
attempt 
to 
reply 
to 
the 
point, 
whereas 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
has 
said 
nothing 
that 
is 
material 
to 
the 
subject, 
but 
has 
only 
tried 
to 
confuse 
the 
question 
by 
a 
whole 
series 
of 
unseemly, 
demagogic 
sallies. 
Unpleasant 
though 
the 
task 
may 
be, 
we 
must 
first 
spend 
some 
time 
in 
cleaning 
this 
Augean 
stable.[91] 



A. 
WHO 
WAS 
OFFENDED 
BY 
THE 
ARTICLE 
"WHERE 
TO 
BEGIN?" 
Let 
us 
quote 
a 
regular 
bouquet 
of 
the 
expletives 
and 
exclamations 
that 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
hurled 
at 
us. 
"It 
is 
not 
a 
newspaper 
that 
can 
create 
a 
party 
organization, 
but 
just 
the 
other 
way 
round. 
. 
. 
." 
"A 
newspaper, 
standing 
above 
the 
party, 
outside 
of 
its 
control, 
and 
independent 
of 
it, 
thanks 
to 
its 
having 
its 
own 
staff 
of 
agents. 
. 
. 
." 
"By 
what 
miracle 
has 
the 
Iskra 
forgotten 
about 
the 
actually 
existing 
Social-Democratic 
organizations 
of 
the 
party 
to 
which 
it 
belongs?. 
. 
." 
"Those 
who 
possess 
firm 
principles 
and 
a 
corresponding 
plan 
are 
the 
supreme 
regulators 
of 
the 
real 
struggle 
of 
the 
party 
and 
dictate 
to 
it 
their 
plan. 
. 
. 
." 
"The 


plan 
drives 
our 
live 
and 
virile 
organizations 
into 
the 
realm 
of 
shadows 
and 
desires 
to 
call 
into 
being 
a 
fantastic 
network 
of 
agents. 
. 
. 
." 
"If 
the 
Iskra's 
plan 
were 
carried 
out, 
every 
trace 
of 
the 
Russian 
Social-Democratic 
labour 
party, 
which 
is 
taking 
shape, 
would 
be 
completely 
wiped 
out. 
. 
. 
." 
"A 
propagandist 
organ 
becomes 
an 
uncontrolled 
autocratic 
lawmaker 
for 
the 
entire 
practical 
revolutionary 
struggle. 
. 
. 
." 
"How 
should 
our 
party 
react 
to 
the 
suggestion 
that 
it 
be 
completely 
subordinated 
to 
an 
autonomous 
editorial 
board?", 
etc., 
etc. 


As 
the 
reader 
can 
see 
from 
the 
contents 
and 
tone 
of 
the 
above 
quotations, 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
has 
taken 
offence. 
Not 
for 
its 
own 
sake, 
but 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
the 
organizations 
and 
committees 
of 
our 
Party 
which 
it 
alleges 
the 
Iskra 
desires 
to 
drive 
into 
the 
realm 
of 
shadows 
and 
even 
obliterate 
their 
traces. 
Terrible, 
isn't 
it? 
But 
the 
curious 
thing 
is 
this. 
The 
article 
"Where 
To 
Begin?" 
appeared 
in 
May 
1901. 
The 
articles 
in 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
appeared 
in 
September 
1901. 
Now 
we 
are 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
January 
1901. 
During 
these 
five 
months 
(prior 
to 
and 
after 
September), 
not 
a 
single 
committee 
and 
not 
a 
single 
organization 
of 
the 
Party 
protested 
formally 
against 
this 
monster 
which 
desires 
to 
drive 
them 
into 
the 
realm 
of 
shadows; 
and 
yet 
scores 
and 
hundreds 
of 
communications 
from 
all 
parts 
of 
Russia 
have 
appeared 
during 
this 
period 
in 
the 
Iskra, 
and 
in 
numerous 
local 
and 
non-local 
publications. 
How 
could 
it 
happen 
that 
those 
who 
would 
be 
driven 
into 
the 
realm 
of 
shadows 
are 
not 
aware 
of 
it 
and 
have 
not 
taken 
offence, 
though 
a 
third 
party 
did 
take 
offence? 


The 
explanation 
is 
that 
the 
committees 
and 
other 
organizations 
are 
engaged 
in 
real 
work 
and 
do 
not 
play 
at 
"democracy." 
The 
committees 
read 



the 
article 
"Where 
To 
Begin?", 


saw 
that 
it 
was 
an 
attempt 
"to 
work 
out 
a 
definite 
plan 
for 
an 
organization 
which 
would 
make 
it 
possible 
to 
set 
about 
building 
that 
organization 
from 
all 
sides," 
and 
as 
they 
knew 
and 
saw 
very 
well 
that 
not 
one 
of 
these 
"sides" 
will 
dream 
of 
"setting 
to 
work 
to 
build 
it" 
until 
it 
is 
convinced 
of 
its 
necessity, 
and 
of 
the 
correctness 
of 
the 
architectural 
plan, 
it 
has 
naturally 
never 
occurred 
to 
them 
to 
take 
offence 
at 
the 
boldness 
of 
the 
people 
who 
said 
in 
the 
Iskra: 
"In 
view 
of 
the 
urgency 
and 
importance 
of 
the 
question, 
we 
make 
bold 
to 
submit 
to 
the 
comrades 
an 
outline 
of 
a 
plan 
which 
is 
developed 
in 
greater 
detail 
in 
a 
pamphlet 
now 
being 
prepared 
for 
the 
press." 
Assuming 
people 
were 
conscientious 
about 
the 
work, 
would 
they 
not 
understand 
that 
if 
the 
comrades 
accepted 
the 
plan 
submitted 
to 
them, 
they 
would 
carry 
it 
out, 
not 
because 
they 
are 
"subordinate" 
but 
because 
they 
would 
be 
convinced 
of 
its 
necessity 
for 
our 
common 
cause, 
and 
that 
if 
they 
did 
not 
accept 
it, 
then 
the 
"outline" 
(a 
pretentious 
word, 
is 
it 
not?) 
would 
remain 
merely 
an 
outline? 
Is 
it 
not 
sheer 
demagogy 
to 
fight 
against 
the 
outline 
of 
a 
plan, 
not 
only 
by 
"picking 
it 
to 
pieces" 
and 
advising 
comrades 
to 
reject 
it, 
but 
also 
by 
inciting 
people 
inexperienced 
in 
revolutionary 
activity 
against 
the 
authors 
of 
the 
outline 
merely 
on 
the 
grounds 
that 
they 
dare 
to 
"make 
laws" 
and 
come 
out 
as 
the 
"supreme 
regulators," 
i.e., 
because 
they 
dare 
to 
submit 
an 
outline 
of 
a 
plan? 
Can 
our 
Party 
develop 
and 
make 
progress 
if 
an 
attempt 
to 
raise 
local 
Party 
workers 
to 
broader 
views, 
tasks, 
plans, 
etc., 
is 
objected 
to, 
not 
only 
on 
the 
ground 
that 
these 
views 
are 
wrong, 
but 
on 
the 
grounds 
that 
the 
very 
"desire" 
to 
"raise" 
is 
"offensive"? 
L. 
Nadezhdin 
also 
"picked" 
our 
plan 
"to 
pieces," 
but 
he 
did 
not 
sink 
to 
such 
demagogy 
as 
cannot 
be 
explained 
by 
naïveté 
or 
by 
primitive 
political 
views. 
Right 
from 
the 
outset, 
he 
emphatically 
re


jected 
the 
charge 
that 
we 
intended 
to 
establish 
an 
"inspectorship 
over 
the 
Party." 
That 
is 
why 
Nadezhdin's 
criticism 
of 
the 
plan 
can 
and 
should 
be 
answered 
on 
its 
merits, 
while 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
deserves 
only 
to 
be 
treated 
with 
contempt. 


But 
contempt 
for 
a 
writer, 
who 
sinks 
to 
shouting 
about 
"autocracy" 
and 
"subordination," 
does 
not 
relieve 
us 
of 
the 
duty 
of 
disentangling 
the 
confusion 
that 
such 
people 
create 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
their 
readers. 
And 
here 
we 
can 
clearly 
demonstrate 
to 
the 
world 
the 
nature 
of 
catchwords 
like 
"broad 
democracy." 
We 
are 
accused 
of 
forgetting 
the 
committees, 
of 
desiring 
or 
attempting 
to 
drive 
them 
into 
the 
realm 
of 
shadows, 
etc. 
How 
can 
we 
reply 
to 



these 
charges 
when, 
owing 
to 
considerations 
of 
secrecy, 
we 
can 
give 
the 
reader 
almost 
no 
facts 
about 
our 
real 
relationships 
with 
the 
committees. 
Persons 
who 
broadcast 
slashing 
accusations 
calculated 
to 
excite 
the 
crowd 
prove 
to 
be 
ahead 
of 
us 
because 
of 
their 
brazenness 
and 
their 
disregard 
of 
the 
duty 
of 
a 
revolutionist 
carefully 
to 
conceal 
from 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
world 
the 
relationships 
and 
contacts 
which 
he 
maintains, 
which 
he 
is 
establishing 
or 
trying 
to 
establish. 
Naturally, 
we 
absolutely 
refuse 
once 
for 
all 
to 
compete 
with 
such 
people 
on 
the 
field 
of 
"democracy." 
As 
regards 
the 
reader 
who 
is 
not 
initiated 
in 
all 
Party 
affairs, 
the 
only 
way 
in 
which 
we 
can 
discharge 
our 
duty 
to 
him 
is 
to 
tell 
him, 
not 
about 
what 
is 
and 
what 
is 
im 
Werden[92] 
but 
about 
a 
particle 
of 
what 
has 
taken 
place 
and 
what 
can 
be 
told 
as 
something 
of 
the 
past. 


The 
Bund 
hints 
that 
we 
are 
"impostors";* 
the 
Union 
Abroad 
accuses 
us 
of 
attempting 
to 
obliterate 
all 
traces 
of

Iskra, 
No.

The 
reply 
of 
the 
Central 
Committee 
of 
the 
General 
Jewish 
Union 
of 
Russia 
and 
Poland 
to 
our 
article 
on 
the 
national 
question. 
the 
Party. 
Gentlemen, 
you 
will 
get 
complete 
satisfaction 
when 
we 
relate 
to 
the 
public 
four 
facts 
concerning 
the 
past. 
First 
fact.[*] 
The 
members 
of 
one 
of 
the 
Leagues 
of 
Struggle, 
who 
took 
a 
direct 
part 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
our 
Party, 
and 
in 
sending 
a 
delegate 
to 
the 
inaugural 
Party 
congress, 
reached 
agreement 
with 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Iskra 
group 
regarding 
the 
publication 
of 
a 
series 
of 
books 
for 
workers 
in 
order 
to 
serve 
the 
whole 
movement. 
The 
attempt 
to 
publish 
the 
series 
failed, 
and 
the 
pamphlets 
written 
for 
it: 
The 
Tasks 
of 
Russian 
Social-Democrats, 
and 
The 
New 
Factory 
Act,[94] 
by 
a 
roundabout 
way, 
and 
through 
the 
medium 
of 
third 
parties, 
found 
their 
way 
abroad, 
and 
were 
there 
published.[95] 


Second 
fact. 
Members 
of 
the 
Central 
Committee 
of 
the 
Bund 
approached 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Iskra 
group 
with 
the 
proposal 
to 
organize 
what 
the 
Bund 
then 
described 
as 
a 
"literary 
laboratory." 
In 
making 
the 
proposal, 
they 
stated 
that 
unless 
this 
was 
done, 
the 
movement 
would 
retrogress 
very 
much. 
The 
result 
of 
these 
negotiations 
was 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
pamphlet, 
The 
Cause 
of 
Labour 
in 
Russia.** 


Third 
fact. 
The 
Central 
Committee 
of 
the 
Bund, 
via 
a 
provincial 
town, 
approaches 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Iskra 
with 
the 
suggestion 
that 
he 
undertake 
the 
editing 
of 
the 
revived 
Rabochaya 
Gazeta 
and, 
of 
course, 
received 
his 
consent. 
This 
offer 
was 
later 
modified. 
The 
comrade 
in 
question 
was 


* 
We 
deliberately 
refrain 
from 
relating 
these 
facts 
in 
the 
order 
in 
which 

they 
occurred.[93] 
** 
The 
author 
of 
this 
pamphlet 
requests 
me 
to 
state 
that 
like 
his 
pre 
vious 
ones, 
it 
was 
sent 
to 
the 
Union 
on 
the 
assumption 
that 
its 
publications 
were 
edited 
by 
the 
Emancipation 
of 
Labour 
group 
(owing 
to 
certain 
circumstances, 
he 
could 
not 
then 
--February 
1899 
--know 
about 
the 
change 
in 
the 
editorship). 
The 
pamphlet 
will 
be 
republished 
by 
the 
League[96] 
at 
an 
early 
date. 


invited 
to 
act 
as 
a 
contributor, 
in 
view 
of 
a 
new 
arrangement 
regarding 
the 
editorial 
board. 
To 
this 
also 
consent 
was, 
of 
course, 
given.[97] 
Articles 
were 
sent 
(which 
we 
managed 
to 
preserve): 
"Our 
Program," 
which 
was 
a 
direct 
protest 
against 
Bernsteinism, 
against 
the 
change 
of 
policy 
in 
legal 
literature 
and 
in 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl; 
"Our 
Immediate 
Task" 
("The 
publication 
of 
a 
party 
organ 
that 
shall 
appear 
regularly 
and 
have 
close 
contacts 
with 
all 
the 
local 
groups"; 
the 
drawbacks 
of 
the 
prevailing 
"amateurishness"); 
"Urgent 
Question" 
(an 
examination 
of 
the 
objection 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
first 
to 
develop 
the 
activities 
of 
local 
groups 
before 
undertaking 
the 
publication 
of 
a 
central 
organ; 
an 
insistence 
on 
the 
paramount 
importance 
of 
a 
"revolutionary 
organization," 
and 
on 
the 
necessity 
of 
"developing 
organization, 
discipline, 
and 
the 
technique 
of 
secrecy 
to 
the 
highest 
degree 
of 
perfection").[98] 
The 
proposal 
to 
resume 
publication 
of 
the 
Rabochaya 
Gazeta 
was 
not 
carried 
out, 
and 
the 
articles 
were 
not 
published. 


Fourth 
fact. 
A 
member 
of 
the 
committee 
which 
was 
or 
ganizing 
the 
second 
regular 
congress 
of 
our 
Party 
communicated 
to 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Iskra 
group 
the 
program 
of 
the 
congress, 
and 
proposed 
that 
group 
for 
the 
editorship 
of 
the 
revived 
Rabochaya 
Gazeta. 
This 
preliminary 
step, 
as 
it 
were, 
was 
later 
sanctioned 
by 
the 
committee 
to 
which 
this 
member 
belonged, 
and 
by 
the 
Central 
Committee 
of 
the 
Bund;[99] 
the 
Iskra 
group 
was 
notified 
of 
the 
place 
and 
time 
of 
the 
congress 
and 
(uncertain 
of 
being 
able, 
for 
definite 
reasons, 
to 
send 
a 
delegate), 
drew 
up 
a 
written 
report 
for 
the 
congress. 
In 
this 
report, 
the 
idea 
was 
suggested 
that 
the 
mere 
election 
of 
a 
central 
committee 
would 
not 
only 
not 
solve 
the 
question 
of 
the 
amalgamation 
at 
a 
time 
when 
complete 
dispersion 
reigns, 
but 
may 
even 
compromise 
the 
grand 
idea 
of 
establishing 
a 
party, 
in 
the 
event 
of 
an 
early, 
swift 
and 
thorough 
police 


round-up, 
which 
was 
more 
than 
likely 
in 
view 
of 
the 
prevailing 
lack 
of 
secrecy, 
and 
that 
therefore, 
a 
beginning 
should 
be 
made 
by 
inviting 
all 
committees 
and 
all 
other 
organizations 
to 
support 
the 
revived 
common 
organ, 
which 
will 
establish 
real 
contacts 
between 
all 
the 
committees 
and 
really 
train 
a 
group 
of 
leaders 
for 
the 
whole 
movement; 
that 
the 
committees 
and 
the 
Party 



could 
very 
easily 
be 
able 
to 
transform 
this 
group 
into 
a 
central 
committee 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
group 
had 
grown 
and 
become 
strong. 
The 
congress, 
however, 
never 
took 
place 
owing 
to 
a 
number 
of 
police 
raids 
and 
arrests. 
For 
reasons 
of 
secrecy, 
the 
report 
was 
destroyed, 
having 
been 
read 
only 
by 
several 
comrades 
including 
the 
representatives 
of 
one 
committee. 


Let 
the 
reader 
now 
judge 
for 
himself 
the 
character 
of 
the 
methods 
employed 
by 
the 
Bund 
in 
hinting 
that 
we 
were 
impostors, 
or 
by 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
which 
accuses 
us 
of 
trying 
to 
relegate 
the 
committees 
to 
the 
realm 
of 
shadows, 
and 
to 
"substitute" 
for 
the 
organization 
of 
a 
party 
an 
organization 
disseminating 
the 
ideas 
advocated 
by 
a 
single 
newspaper. 
It 
was 
to 
the 
committees, 
on 
their 
repeated 
invitation, 
that 
we 
reported 
on 
the 
necessity 
for 
adopting 
a 
definite 
plan 
of 
concerted 
activities. 
It 
was 
precisely 
for 
the 
Party 
organization 
that 
we 
elaborated 
this 
plan, 
in 
articles 
published 
in 
the 
Rabochaya 
Gazeta, 
and 
in 
the 
report 
to 
the 
Party 
congress, 
again 
on 
the 
invitation 
of 
those 
who 
held 
such 
an 
influential 
position 
in 
the 
Party 
that 
they 
took 
the 
initiative 
in 
its 
(actual) 
revival. 
And 
only 
after 
the 
twice 
repeated 
attempts 
of 
the 
Party 
organization, 
in 
conjunction 
with 
ourselves, 
officially 
to 
revive 
the 
central 
organ 
of 
the 
Party 
had 
failed, 
did 
we 
consider 
it 
our 
bounden 
duty 
to 
publish 
an 
unofficial 
organ, 
in 
order 
that 
with 
this 
third 
attempt 
the 
comrades 
might 
have 
before 
them 
the 
results 
of 
experience 


and 
not 
merely 
conjectural 
proposals. 
At 
present 
certain 
results 
of 
this 
experience 
are 
there 
for 
all 
to 
see, 
and 
all 
comrades 
may 
now 
judge 
as 
to 
whether 
we 
properly 
understood 
our 
duties, 
and 
what 
should 
be 
thought 
of 
persons 
who 
strive 
to 
mislead 
those 
who 
are 
unacquainted 
with 
the 
immediate 
past, 
simply 
because 
they 
are 
vexed 
with 
our 
having 
pointed 
out 
to 
some 
their 
inconsistency 
on 
the 
"national" 
question, 
and 
to 
others 
the 
inadmissibility 
of 
unprincipled 
waverings. 



B. 
CAN 
A 
NEWSPAPER 
BE 
A 
COLLECTIVE 
ORGANIZER? 
The 
main 
point 
of 
the 
article 
"Where 
To 
Begin?" 
is 
that 
it 
discusses 
precisely 
this 
question 
and 
gives 
an 
affirmative 
reply 
to 
it. 
As 
far 
as 
we 
know, 
the 
only 
attempt 
to 
examine 
this 
question 
on 
its 
merits 
and 
to 
prove 
that 
it 
must 
be 
answered 
in 
the 
negative 
was 
made 
by 
L. 
Nadezhdin, 
whose 
argument 
we 
reproduce 
in 
full: 


". 
. 
. 
It 
greatly 
pleased 
us 
to 
see 
the 
Iskra 
(No. 
4) 
raise 
the 
question 
of 
the 
need 
for 
an 
all-Russian 
newspaper, 
but 
we 
cannot 
agree 
that 
it 
fits 
in 
with 
the 
title 
of 
the 
article: 
'Where 
To 
Begin?' 
Undoubtedly 
this 
is 
an 
extremely 
important 
matter, 
but 
neither 
a 
newspaper, 
nor 
a 
whole 
series 
of 
popular 
leaflets, 
nor 
a 
whole 
mountain 
of 
manifestoes, 
can 
serve 
as 
the 
basis 
for 
a 
militant 
organization 
in 
revolutionary 
times. 
We 
must 
set 
to 
work 
to 
build 
up 
strong 
political 
organizations 
in 
the 
localities. 
We 
lack 
such 
organizations; 
we 
have 
been 
carrying 
on 
our 
work 
mainly 
among 
enlightened 
workers, 
while 
the 
masses 
have 
been 
engaged 
almost 
exclusively 
in 
the 
economic 
struggle. 
If 
strong 
political 
organizations 
are 
not 
trained 
locally, 
what 
will 
be 
the 
use 
of 
even 
an 
excellently 
organized 
all-Russian 
newspaper? 
It 
will 
be 
a 
burning 
bush, 
burning 
without 
being 
consumed, 
but 
firing 
no 
one! 
The 
Iskra 
thinks 
that 
around 
it, 
in 
the 
work 
for 
it 
people 
will 
gather 
and 
organize. 
But 
they 
will 
find 
it 
far 
easier 
to 
gather 
and 
organize 
around 
work 
that 
is 
more 
concrete! 
This 
something 


more 
concrete 
must 
and 
should 
be 
the 
extensive 
organization 
of 
local 
newspapers, 
the 
immediate 
preparation 
of 
the 
workers' 
forces 
for 
demonstrations, 
constant 
work 
by 
local 
organizations 
among 
the 
unemployed 
(regular 
distriblltion 
of 
pamphlets 
and 
leaflets, 
meetings, 
appeals 
to 
resist 
the 
government, 
etc.). 
We 
must 
begin 
live 
political 
work 
in 
the 
localities, 
and 
when 
the 
time 
comes 
to 
amalgamate 
on 
this 
real 
basis, 
it 
will 
not 
be 
an 
artificial, 
a 
paper 
amalgamation, 
it 
will 
not 
be 
by 
means 
of 
newspapers 
that 
such 
an 
amalgamation 
of 
local 
work 
into 
an 
all-Russian 
cause 
will 
be 
achieved!" 
(The 
Eve 
of 
Revolution, 
p. 
54.) 


We 
have 
emphasized 
the 
passages 
in 
this 
eloquent 
tirade 
which 
most 
strikingly 
illustrate 
the 
author's 
incorrect 
judgment 
of 
our 
plan, 
and 
the 
incorrectness 
of 
his 
point 
of 
view 
in 
general, 
which 
he 
opposes 
to 
that 
of 
the 
Iskra. 
Unless 
we 
train 
strong 
political 
organizations 
in 
the 
localities 
-even 
an 
excellently 
organized 
all-Russian 
newspaper 
will 
be 
of 
no 
avail. 



Absolutely 
true. 
But 
the 
whole 
point 
is 
that 
there 
is 
no 
other 
way 
of 
t 
r 
a 
i 
n 
i 
ng 
strong 
political 
organizations 
except 
through 
the 
medium 
of 
an 
all-
Russian 
newspaper. 
The 
author 
missed 
the 
most 
important 
statement 
the 
Iskra 
made 
before 
it 
proceeded 
to 
set 
forth 
its 
"p]an": 
that 
it 
was 
necessary 
"to 
call 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
revolutionary 
organization, 
capable 
of 
combining 
all 
the 
forces 
and 
of 
leading 
the 
movement 
not 
only 
in 
name, 
but 
in 
deed, 
i.e., 
an 
organization 
that 
will 
be 
ready 
at 
any 
moment 
to 
support 
every 
protest 
and 
every 
outbreak, 
and 
to 
utilize 
these 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
increasing 
and 
strengthening 
the 
military 
forces 
required 
for 
decisive 
battle." 
But 
now 
after 
the 
February 
and 
March 
events, 
everyone 
will 
agree 
with 
this 
in 
principle, 
continues 
the 
Iskra. 
Yet 
what 
we 
need 
is 
not 
a 
solution 
of 
the 
problem 
in 
principle, 
but 
a 
practical 
solution 
of 
it; 
we 
must 
immediately 
advance 
a 
definite 
constructive 
plan 
in 
order 
that 
everyone 
may 
immediately 
set 
to 
work 
to 
build 
from 
every 
side. 
And 
now 
we 
are 
again 
being 
dragged 


away 
from 
the 
practical 
solution 
towards 
something 
that 
in 
principle 
is 
correct, 
indisputable 
and 
great, 
but 
is 
absolutely 
inadequate 
and 
absolutely 
incomprehensible 
to 
the 
broad 
masses 
of 
workers, 
namely, 
to 
"train 
strong 
political 
organizations"! 
This 
is 
not 
the 
point 
at 
issue, 
most 
worthy 
author! 
The 
point 
is 
how 
to 
go 
about 
the 
training 
and 
how 
to 
accomplish 
it! 


It 
is 
not 
true 
to 
say 
that 
"we 
have 
been 
carrying 
on 
our 
work 
mainly 
among 
enlightened 
workers, 
while 
the 
masses 
have 
been 
engaged 
almost 
exclusively 
in 
the 
economic 
struggle." 
Presented 
in 
such 
a 
form, 
this 
thesis 
reduces 
itself 
to 
the 
Svoboda's 
usual 
but 
fundamentally 
fallacious 
proclivity 
to 
oppose 
the 
enlightened 
workers 
to 
the 
"mass." 
In 
recent 
years, 
even 
the 
enlightened 
workers 
have 
been 
"engaged 
almost 
exclusively 
in 
the 
economic 
struggle." 
That 
is 
the 
first 
point. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
masses 
will 
never 
learn 
to 
conduct 
the 
political 
struggle 
until 
we 
help 
to 
train 
leaders 
for 
this 
struggle, 
both 
from 
among 
the 
enlightened 
workers 
and 
from 
among 
the 
intellectuals; 
and 
such 
leaders 
can 
acquire 
training 
solely 
by 
systematically 
appraising 
all 
the 
everyday 
aspects 
of 
our 
political 
life, 
of 
all 
attempts 
at 
protest 
and 
struggle 
on 
the 
part 
of 
various 
classes 
and 
on 
various 
grounds. 
Therefore, 
to 
talk 
about 
"training 
political 
organizations" 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
to 
contrast 
the 
"paper 
work" 
of 
a 
political 
newspaper 
to 
"live 
political 
work 
in 
the 
localities" 
is 
simply 
ridiculousl 
Why, 
the 
Iskra 
has 
adapted 
its 
"plan" 
for 
a 
newspaper 
to 
the 
"plan" 
for 
creating 
a 
"militant 
preparedness" 
to 
support 
the 
unemployed 
movement, 
peasant 
revolts, 
discontent 
among 
the 



Zemstvo-ites, 
"popular 
indignation 
against 
the 
reckless 
tsarist 
bashibazouks," 
etc. 
Everyone 
who 
is 
at 
all 
acquainted 
with 
the 
movement 
knows 
perfectly 
well 
that 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 


local 
organizations 
never 
even 
dream 
of 
these 
things, 
that 
many 
of 
the 
prospects 
of 
"live 
political 
work" 
here 
indicated 
have 
never 
been 
realized 
by 
a 
single 
organization, 
that 
the 
attempt, 
for 
example, 
to 
call 
attention 
to 
the 
growth 
of 
discontent 
and 
protest 
among 
the 
Zemstvo 
intelligentsia 
rouses 
feelings 
of 
consternation 
and 
perplexity 
in 
Nadezhdin 
("Good 
Lord, 
is 
this 
newspaper 
intended 
for 
Zemstvo-ites?" 
--The 
Eve, 
p. 
129), 
among 
the 
Economists 
(letter 
to 
the 
Iskra 
No. 
12) 
and 
among 
many 
practical 
workers. 
Under 
these 
circumstances, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
"begin" 
only 
by 
inducing 
people 
to 
think 
about 
all 
these 
things, 
by 
inducing 
them 
to 
summarize 
and 
generalize 
all 
the 
diverse 
signs 
of 
ferment 
and 
active 
struggle. 
"Live 
political 
work" 
can 
be 
begun 
in 
our 
time, 
when 
Social-Democratic 
tasks 
are 
being 
degraded 
exclusively 
with 
live 
political 
agitation, 
which 
is 
impossible 
unless 
we 
have 
an 
all-Russian 
newspaper, 
frequently 
issued 
and 
properly 
distributed. 


Those 
who 
regard 
the 
Iskra's 
"plan" 
as 
a 
manifestation 
of 
"literariness" 
have 
totally 
failed 
to 
understand 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
plan, 
and 
imagine 
that 
what 
is 
suggested 
as 
the 
most 
suitable 
means 
for 
the 
present 
time 
is 
the 
goal. 
These 
people 
have 
not 
taken 
the 
trouble 
to 
study 
the 
two 
comparisons 
that 
were 
drawn 
to 
clearly 
illustrate 
the 
plan 
proposed. 
The 
Iskra 
wrote: 
the 
publication 
of 
an 
all-Russian 
political 
newspaper 
must 
be 
the 
main 
line 
by 
adhering 
to 
which 
we 
could 
unswervingly 
develop 
deeper, 
and 
expand 
this 
organization 
(i.e., 
a 
revolutionary 
organization 
always 
prepared 
to 
support 
every 
protest 
and 
every 
outbreak). 
Pray 
tell 
me: 
when 
bricklayers 
lay 
bricks 
in 
various 
parts 
of 
an 
enormous 
structure 
the 
like 
of 
which 
has 
never 
been 
seen 
before, 
is 
it 
"paper" 
work 
to 
use 
a 
line 
to 
help 
them 
find 
the 
correct 
place 
in 
which 
to 
put 
each 
brick, 
to 
indicate 
to 


them 
the 
ultimate 
purpose 
of 
the 
work 
as 
a 
whole, 
enable 
them 
to 
use 
not 
only 
every 
brick 
but 
even 
every 
piece 
of 
brick 
which, 
joining 
with 
the 
bricks 
placed 
before 
and 
after 
it, 
forms 
a 
complete 
and 
all-embracing 
line? 
And 
are 
we 
not 
now 
passing 
through 
just 
such 
a 
period 
in 
our 
Party 
life 
when 
we 
have 
bricks 
and 
bricklayers, 
but 
lack 
the 
guiding 
line 
which 
all 
could 
see 
and 
follow? 
Let 
them 
shout 
that 
in 
stretching 
out 
the 
line, 
we 
want 
to 
command. 
Had 
we 
desired 
to 
command, 
gentlemen, 
we 
would 
have 
written 
on 
the 
title 
page, 
not 
"Iskra, 
No. 
1," 
but 
"Rabochaya 
Gazeta, 
No. 
3," 
as 
we 
were 
invited 



to 
do 
by 
a 
number 
of 
comrades, 
and 
as 
we 
would 
have 
had 
a 
perfect 
right 
to 
do 
after 
the 
events 
described 
above. 
But 
we 
did 
not 
do 
that. 
We 
wished 
to 
have 
our 
hands 
free 
to 
wage 
an 
irreconcilable 
struggle 
against 
all 
pseudo 
Social-Democrats; 
we 
wanted 
our 
line, 
if 
properly 
laid, 
to 
be 
respected 
because 
it 
was 
correct, 
and 
not 
because 
it 
was 
laid 
by 
an 
official 
organ. 


"The 
question 
of 
uniting 
local 
activity 
in 
central 
bodies 
runs 
in 
a 
vicious 
circle," 
L. 
Nadezhdin 
lectures 
us; 
"unifica 
tion 
requires 
homogeneous 
elements, 
and 
this 
can 
be 
created 
only 
by 
something 
that 
unites; 
but 
this 
uniting 
element 
may 
be 
the 
product 
of 
strong 
local 
organizations 
which 
at 
the 
present 
time 
are 
by 
no 
means 
distinguished 
for 
their 
homo 
geneity." 
This 
truism 
is 
as 
hoary 
and 
indisputable 
as 
the 
one 
that 
says 
we 
must 
train 
strong 
political 
organizations. 
And 
it 
is 
equally 
barren. 
Every 
question 
"runs 
in 
a 
vicious 
circle" 
because 
the 
whole 
of 
political 
life 
is 
an 
endless 
chain 
consisting 
of 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
links. 
The 
whole 
art 
of 
politics 
lies 
in 
finding 
and 
gripping 
as 
strong 
as 
we 
can 
the 
link 
that 
is 
least 
likely 
to 
be 
torn 
out 
of 
our 
hands, 
the 
one 
that 
is 
most 
important 
at 
the 
given 
moment, 
the 
one 
that 
guarantees 
the 
possessor 
of 
a 
link 
the 
possession 
of 
the 


whole 
chain.[*] 
If 
we 
had 
a 
staff 
of 
experienced 
bricklayers, 
who 
had 
learned 
to 
work 
so 
well 
together 
that 
they 
could 
place 
their 
bricks 
exactly 
where 
they 
were 
required 
without 
a 
guiding 
line 
(and, 
speaking 
abstractly, 
this 
is 
by 
no 
means 
impossible), 
then 
perhaps 
we 
might 
seize 
upon 
some 
other 
link. 
But 
the 
unfortunate 
thing 
is 
that 
we 
have 
no 
experienced 
bricklayers 
trained 
to 
teamwork 
yet, 
that 
bricks 
are 
often 
laid 
where 
they 
are 
not 
needed 
at 
all, 
that 
they 
are 
not 
laid 
according 
to 
the 
general 
line, 
but 
are 
so 
scattered 
about 
that 
the 
enemy 
can 
shatter 
the 
structure 
as 
if 
it 
were 
made 
not 
of 
bricks 
but 
of 
sand. 


Here 
is 
the 
other 
comparison: 
"A 
newspaper 
is 
not 
only 
a 
collective 
propagandist 
and 
collective 
agitator, 
but 
also 
a 
collective 
organizer. 
In 
this 
respect 
it 
can 
be 
compared 
to 
the 
scaffolding 
erected 
around 
a 
building 
in 
construction; 
it 
marks 
the 
contours 
of 
the 
structure 
and 
facilitates 
communication 
between 
the 
builders, 
permitting 
them 
to 
distribute 
the 
work 
and 
to 
view 
the 
common 
results 
achieved 
by 
their 
organized 
labour."** 
Does 
this 
sound 
anything 
like 
an 
attempt 
of 
an 
armchair 
author 
to 
exaggerate 
his 
role? 
The 
scaffolding 
is 
not 
required 
at 
all 
for 
habitation, 
it 
is 
made 
of 
the 
cheapest 
material, 
it 
is 
only 
put 
up 
temporarily, 
and 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
shell 
of 
the 
structure 
is 
completed, 
is 
scrapped 
for 
firewood. 
As 
for 
the 
building 
up 
of 
revolutionary

Comrade 
Krichevsky

Comrade

I 
call 
your 
attention 
to 
this 
outrageous 
manifestation 
of 
"autocracy," 
"uncontrolled 
authority," 
"supreme 
regulating," 
etc. 
Just 
think 
of 
it: 
a 
desire 
to 
possess 
the 
whole 
chain!! 
Send 
in 
a 
complaint 
at 
once, 
Here 
you 
have 
a 
ready-prepared 
subject 
for 
two 
leading 
articles 
for 
No. 
12 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo! 
** 
Martynov, 
quoting 
the 
first 
sentence 
in 
this 
passage 
in 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
(No. 
10, 
p. 
62), 
left 
out 
the 
second 
sentence 
as 
if 
desiring 
to 
emphasize 
by 
that 
either

unwillingness 
to 
discuss

essentials 
of 
the 
question, 
or 
his 
incapability 
of 
understanding 
them. 
organizations, 
experience 
shows 
that 
sometimes 
they 
may 
be 
built 
without 
scaffolding 
--take 
the 
'seventies 
for 
example. 
But 
at 
the 
present 
time 
we 
cannot 
imagine 
that 
the 
building 
we 
require 
can 
be 
put 
up 
without 
scaffolding. 


Nadezhdin 
disagrees 
with 
this, 
and 
says: 
"The 
Iskra 
thinks 
that 
around 
it, 
in 
the 
work 
for 
it 
people 
will 
gather 
and 
organize. 
But 
they 
will 
find 
it 
far 
easier 
to 
gather 
and 
organize 
around 
work 
that 
is 
more 
concrete 
!" 
So! 
So! 
"they 
will 
hnd 
it 
far 
easier 
to 
gather 
around 
work 
that 
is 
more 
concrete. 
. 
. 
." 
There 
is 
a 
Russian 
proverb 
which 
says: 
"Don't 
spit 
into 
a 
well, 
you 
may 
want 
to 
drink 
out 
of 
it." 
But 
there 
are 
people 
who 
do 
not 
object 
to 
drinking 
from 
a 
well 
which 
has 
been 
spat 
into. 
What 
despicable 
things 
our 
magnificent, 
legal 
"critics 
of 
Marxism" 
and 
illegal 
admirers 
of 
the 
Rabochaya 
Mysl 
have 
said 
in 
the 
name 
of 
this 
something 
more 
concretet 
How 
restricted 
our 
movement 
is 
by 
our 
own 
narrowness, 
lack 
of 
initiative 
and 
hesitation, 
which 
is 
justified 
by 
the 
traditional 
argument 
about 
finding 
it 
"far 
easier 
to 
gather 
around 
work 
that 
is 
more 
concrete"! 
And 
Nadezhdin 
--who 
regards 
himself 
as 
possessing 
a 
particularly 
keen 
sense 
of 
the 
"realities 
of 
life," 
who 
so 
severely 
condemns 
"armchair" 
authors 
(with 
pretensions 
to 
being 
witty) 
and 
accuses 
the 
Iskra 
of 
a 
weakness 
for 
seeing 
Economism 
everywhere, 
and 
who 
imagines 
that 
he 
stands 
far 
above 
this 
division 
between 
the 
orthodox 
and 
the 
critics 
--fails 
to 
see 
that 
with 
his 
arguments 
he 
is 
playing 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
narrowness 
that 
arouses 
his 
indignation 
and 
that 
he 
is 
drinking 
from 
a 
well 
that 
has 
actually 
been 
spat 
into! 
Yes, 
the 
sincerest 
indignation 
against 
narrowness, 
the 
most 
passionate 
desire 
to 
raise 
those 
who 
worship 
this 
narrowness 
from 
their 
knees, 
is 
insufficient 
if 
the 
indignant 
one 
is 
swept 
along 
without 
sail 
or 
rudder, 
and 
as 
"spontaneously" 
as 
the 
revolu


tionaries 
of 
the 
'seventies, 
clutches 
at 
such 
things 
as 
"excitative 
terror," 
"agrarian 
terror," 
"sounding 
the 
tocsin," 
etc. 
Glance 
at 
this 
"more 
concrete" 



work 
around 
which 
he 
thinks 
it 
will 
be 
"far 
easier" 
to 
gather 
and 
organize: 
1) 
local 
newspapers; 
2) 
preparations 
for 
demonstrations; 
3) 
work 
among 
the 
unemployed. 
It 
will 
be 
seen 
at 
the 
very 
first 
glance 
that 
all 
these 
have 
been 
seized 
upon 
at 
random 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
say 
something, 
for 
however 
we 
may 
regard 
them, 
it 
would 
be 
absurd 
to 
see 
in 
them 
anything 
especially 
suitable 
for 
"gathering 
and 
organizing." 
Why, 
this 
very 
Nadezhdin 
says 
a 
few 
pages 
further 
on: 
"It 
is 
time 
we 
simply 
stated 
the 
fact 
that 
extremely 
petty 
work 
is 
being 
carried 
on 
in 
the 
localities, 
the 
committees 
are 
not 
doing 
a 
tenth 
of 
what 
they 
could 
do 
. 
. 
. 
the 
unifying 
centres 
that 
we 
have 
at 
the 
present 
time 
are 
a 
pure 
fiction, 
they 
represent 
a 
sort 
of 
revolutionary 
bureaucracy, 
mutual 
promotion 
of 
each 
other 
to 
the 
post 
of 
general; 
and 
so 
it 
will 
continue 
until 
strong 
local 
organizations 
grow 
up." 
These 
remarks, 
though 
exaggerating 
the 
position 
somewhat, 
no 
doubt 
contain 
many 
a 
bitter 
truth, 
but 
can 
it 
be 
said 
that 
Nadezhdin 
does 
not 
see 
the 
connection 
between 
the 
petty 
work 
carried 
on 
in 
the 
localities 
and 
the 
narrow 
outlook 
of 
the 
Party 
workers, 
the 
narrow 
scope 
of 
their 
activities, 
which 
is 
inevitable 
in 
view 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
training 
of 
the 
Party 
workers 
confined 
to 
their 
local 
organizations? 
Has 
he, 
like 
the 
author 
of 
the 
article 
on 
organization 
published 
in 
the 
Svoboda, 
forgotten 
how 
the 
transition 
to 
a 
broad 
local 
press 
(from 
1898) 
was 
accompanied 
by 
a 
very 
strong 
intensification 
of 
Economism 
and 
"amateurishness" 
? 
Even 
if 
a 
"broad 
local 
press" 
could 
be 
established 
at 
all 
satisfactorily 
(and 
we 
have 
shown 
above 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
save 
in 
very 
exceptional 
cases) 
--even 
then 
the 
local 
organs 
could 
not 
"gather 
and 
organize" 
all 


the 
revolutionary 
forces 
for 
a 
general 
attack 
upon 
the 
autocracy 
and 
for 
the 
leadership 
of 
a 
united 
struggle. 
Do 
not 
forget 
that 
we 
are 
here 
discussing 
only 
the 
"gathering," 
the 
organizing 
significance 
of 
a 
newspaper, 
and 
we 
could 
put 
to 
Nadezhdin, 
who 
defends 
scatteredness, 
the 
ironical 
question 
that 
he 
himself 
has 
put: 
"Has 
someone 
left 
us 
a 
legacy 
of 
200,000 
revolutionary 
organizers?" 
Furthermore, 
"preparations 
for 
demonstrations" 
cannot 
be 
opposed 
to 
the 
Iskra's 
plan 
for 
the 
very 
reason 
that 
this 
plan 
includes 
the 
organization 
of 
the 
widest 
possible 
demonstrations 
as 
one 
of 
its 
aims; 
the 
point 
under 
discussion 
is 
the 
choice 
of 
the 
practical 
means. 
On 
this 
point 
also 
Nadezhdin 
is 
confused 
for 
he 
has 
lost 
sight 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
only 
already 
"gathered 
and 
organized" 
forces 
can 
"prepare 
for" 
demonstrations 
(which 
hitherto, 
in 
the 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
cases, 
have 
taken 
place 
quite 
spontaneously) 
and 
we 
lack 
precisely 
the 
ability 
to 
gather 
and 
organize. 



"Work 
among 
the 
unemployed." 
Again 
the 
same 
confusion, 
for 
this 
too 
represents 
one 
of 
the 
military 
operations 
of 
the 
mobilized 
forces 
and 
not 
a 
plan 
for 
mobilizing 
the 
forces. 
The 
extent 
to 
which 
Nadezhdin 
here 
too 
underestimates 
the 
harm 
caused 
by 
our 
state 
of 
scatteredness, 
by 
our 
lack 
of 
"200,000 
organizers," 
can 
be 
seen 
from 
the 
following: 
many 
(including 
Nadezhdin) 
have 
reproached 
the 
Iskra 
with 
the 
paucity 
of 
the 
news 
it 
gives 
about 
unemployment 
and 
with 
the 
casual 
nature 
of 
the 
correspondence 
it 
publishes 
about 
the 
most 
common 
affairs 
of 
rural 
life. 
The 
reproach 
is 
justified, 
but 
the 
Iskra's 
"guilty 
without 
sin." 
We 
strive 
"to 
stretch 
a 
line" 
through 
the 
countryside 
too, 
but 
there 
are 
almost 
no 
bricklayers 
there, 
and 
we 
are 
obliged 
to 
encourage 
everyone 
who 
informs 
us 
even 
on 
the 
most 
common 
facts, 
in 
the 
hope 
that 
this 
will 
increase 
the 
number 
of 
our 
contributors 
in 
this 
field 
and 
will 


ultimately 
train 
us 
all 
to 
select 
the 
really 
most 
outstanding 
facts. 
But 
the 
material 
on 
which 
we 
can 
train 
is 
so 
scanty 
that 
unless 
we 
generalize 
it 
for 
the 
whole 
of 
Russia 
we 
shall 
have 
very 
little 
to 
train 
on 
at 
all. 
No 
doubt 
one 
who 
possesses 
at 
least 
as 
much 
capability 
as 
an 
agitator 
and 
as 
much 
knowledge 
of 
the 
life 
of 
the 
vagrant 
as 
apparently 
Nadezhdin 
does, 
could 
render 
priceless 
service 
to 
the 
movement 
by 
carrying 
on 
agitation 
among 
the 
unemployed 
-but 
a 
person 
of 
this 
description 
would 
be 
simply 
burying 
his 
talents 
if 
he 
failed 
to 
inform 
all 
comrades 
in 
Russia 
of 
every 
step 
he 
took 
in 
his 
work, 
in 
order 
that 
others, 
who, 
in 
the 
mass, 
as 
yet 
lack 
the 
ability 
to 
undertake 
new 
kinds 
of 
work, 
might 
learn 
from 
his 
example. 


Absolutely 
everybody 
now 
talks 
about 
the 
importance 
of 
unity, 
about 
the 
necessity 
for 
"gathering 
and 
organizing" 
but 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
cases 
what 
is 
lacking 
is 
a 
definite 
idea 
of 
where 
to 
begin 
and 
how 
to 
bring 
about 
this 
unity. 
Probably 
everyone 
will 
agree 
that 
if 
we 
"unite," 
say, 
the 
district 
circles 
in 
a 
given 
city? 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
have 
for 
this 
purpose 
common 
institutions, 
i.e., 
not 
merely 
a 
common 
title 
of 
"Union" 
but 
genuinely 
common 
work 
exchange 
of 
material, 
experience 
and 
forces, 
distribution 
of 
functions 
not 
only 
by 
districts, 
but 
specializing 
them 
on 
a 
citywide 
scale. 
Everyone 
will 
agree 
that 
a 
big 
secret 
apparatus 
will 
not 
pay 
its 
way 
(to 
use 
a 
commercial 
expression) 
"with 
the 
resources" 
(in 
material 
and 
man 
power, 
of 
course), 
of 
a 
single 
district, 
and 
that 
this 
narrow 
field 
will 
not 
provide 
sufficient 
scope 
for 
a 
specialist 
to 
develop 
his 
talents. 
But 
the 
same 
thing 
applies 
to 
the 
unification 
of 
a 
number 
of 
cities, 
because 
even 
a 
whole 
locality 
will 
prove, 
and 
has 
already 
proved 
in 
the 
history 
of 
our 
Social



Democratic 
movement, 
to 
be 
far 
too 
narrow 
a 
field: 
we 
have 
already 
proved 
this 
above 
in 
detail 


with 
regard 
to 
political 
agitation 
and 
organizational 
work. 
What 
we 
require 
first 
and 
foremost 
and 
most 
imperatively, 
is 
to 
widen 
the 
field, 
establish 
real 
contacts 
between 
the 
cities 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
regular, 
common 
work; 
for 
scatteredness 
weighs 
down 
our 
people 
who 
are 
"stuck 
in 
a 
hole" 
(to 
use 
the 
expression 
employed 
by 
a 
correspondent 
to 
the 
Iskra 
), 
not 
knowing 
what 
is 
happening 
in 
the 
world, 
from 
whom 
to 
learn, 
or 
how 
to 
acquire 
experience 
and 
satisfy 
their 
desire 
to 
engage 
in 
broad 
activities. 
And 
I 
continue 
to 
insist 
that 
we 
can 
start 
establishing 
real 
contacts 
only 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
a 
common 
newspaper, 
as 
the 
only 
regular, 
all-Russian 
enterprise, 
which 
will 
summarize 
the 
results 
of 
the 
most 
diverse 
forms 
of 
activity 
and 
thereby 
stimulate 
people 
to 
march 
forward 
untiringly 
along 
all 
the 
innumerable 
paths 
which 
lead 
to 
revolution 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
all 
roads 
lead 
to 
Rome. 
If 
it 
is 
not 
in 
name 
only 
that 
we 
want 
unity, 
we 
must 
arrange 
for 
every 
local 
circle 
immediately 
to 
assign, 
say, 
a 
fourth 
of 
its 
forces 
to 
active 
work 
for 
the 
common 
cause 
and 
the 
newspaper 
will 
immediately 
convey 
to 
them* 
the 
general 
design, 
dimensions 
and 
character 
of 
this 
cause, 
will 
give 
them 
a 
precise 
indication 
of 
the 
most 
keenly 
felt 
defects 
of 
all-Russian 
activity, 
where 
agitation 
is 
lacking 
and 
where 
contacts 
are 
weak, 
and 
point 
out 
which 
cogs 
in 
the 
vast 
general 
mechanism 
could 
be 
repaired 
or 
replaced 
by 
better 
ones. 
A 
circle 
that 
has 
not 
yet 
commenced 
to 
work, 
but 
which 
is 
only 
just 
seeking 
work, 
could 
then 
start, 
not 


* 
A 
reservation 
: 
that 
is, 
if 
a 
given 
circle 
sympathizes 
with 
the 
policy 
of 
that 
newspaper 
and 
considers 
it 
useful 
to 
become 
a 
collaborator, 
meaning 
by 
that, 
not 
only 
literary 
collaboration, 
but 
revolutionary 
collaboration 
generally. 
Note 
for 
the 
"Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
": 
among 
revolutionists 
who 
attach 
value 
to 
the 
cause 
and 
not 
to 
playing 
at 
democracy, 
who 
do 
not 
separate 
"sympathy" 
from 
the 
most 
active 
and 
lively 
participation, 
this 
reservation 
is 
taken 
for 
granted. 
like 
a 
craftsman 
in 
a 
separate 
little 
workshop 
unaware 
of 
the 
development 
that 
has 
taken 
place 
in 
"industry" 
before 
him 
or 
of 
the 
general 
level 
of 
production 
methods 
prevailing 
in 
industry, 
but 
as 
a 
participant 
in 
an 
extensive 
enterprise 
that 
reflects 
the 
whole 
general 
revolutionary 
attack 
on 
the 
autocracy. 
And 
the 
more 
perfect 
the 
finish 
of 
each 
cog, 
the 
larger 
the 
number 
of 
detail 
workers 
engaged 
in 
the 
common 
cause, 
the 
closer 
will 
our 
network 
become 
and 
the 
less 
will 
be 
the 
consternation 
in 
the 
general 
ranks 
resulting 



from 
inevitable 
police 
raids. 


Actual 
contacts 
would 
begin 
to 
be 
established 
by 
the 
mere 
function 
of 
distributing 
a 
newspaper 
(that 
is, 
if 
it 
is 
a 
newspaper 
worthy 
of 
the 
name, 
i.e., 
if 
it 
is 
issued 
regularly, 
not 
once 
a 
month 
like 
a 
magazine, 
but 
four 
times 
a 
month). 
At 
the 
present 
time, 
communication 
between 
cities 
on 
revolutionary 
business 
is 
an 
extreme 
rarity, 
and 
at 
all 
events 
the 
exception 
rather 
than 
the 
rule. 
If 
we 
had 
a 
newspaper, 
however, 
such 
communication 
would 
become 
the 
rule 
and 
would 
secure, 
not 
only 
the 
distribution 
of 
the 
newspaper, 
of 
course, 
but 
also 
(and 
what 
is 
more 
important) 
an 
exchange 
of 
experience, 
of 
material, 
of 
forces 
and 
of 
resources. 
The 
scope 
of 
organizational 
work 
would 
immediately 
become 
many 
times 
wider 
and 
the 
success 
of 
one 
locality 
would 
serve 
as 
a 
standing 
encouragement 
to 
further 
perfection 
and 
would 
arouse 
the 
desire 
to 
utilize 
the 
experience 
already 
gained 
by 
comrades 
working 
in 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
country. 
Local 
work 
would 
become 
far 
richer 
and 
more 
varied 
than 
it 
is 
now: 
political 
and 
economic 
exposures 
gathered 
from 
all 
over 
Russia 
would 
provide 
mental 
food 
for 
workers 
of 
all 
trades 
and 
in 
all 
stages 
of 
development, 
would 
provide 
material 
and 
occasion 
for 
talks 
and 
readings 
on 
the 
most 
diverse 
subjects, 
which 
would, 
in 
addition, 
be 
suggested 
by 


hints 
in 
the 
legal 
press, 
by 
talk 
among 
the 
public 
and 
by 
the 
"shamefaced" 
government 
statements. 
Every 
outbreak, 
every 
demonstration, 
would 
be 
weighed 
and 
discussed 
in 
all 
its 
aspects 
in 
all 
parts 
of 
Russia; 
it 
would 
stimulate 
a 
desire 
to 
keep 
up 
with 
the 
rest 
(we 
Socialists 
do 
not 
by 
any 
means 
reject 
all 
rivalry 
or 
all 
"competition"!) 
and 
consciously 
to 
prepare 
for 
that 
which 
at 
first 
appeared 
spontaneously 
as 
it 
were, 
a 
desire 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
favourable 
conditions 
in 
a 
given 
district 
or 
at 
a 
given 
moment 
for 
modifying 
the 
plan 
of 
attack, 
etc. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
this 
revival 
of 
local 
work 
would 
not 
result 
in 
that 
desperate, 
"convulsive" 
exertion 
of 
all 
efforts 
and 
the 
risking 
of 
all 
forces 
which 
every 
single 
demonstration 
or 
the 
publication 
of 
every 
single 
issue 
of 
a 
local 
newspaper 
now 
frequently 
entails. 
On 
the 
one 
hand 
the 
police 
would 
find 
it 
much 
more 
difficult 
to 
get 
at 
the 
"roots," 
once 
they 
do 
not 
know 
in 
what 
district 
to 
seek 
for 
them. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
regular 
common 
work 
would 
train 
our 
people 
to 
adjust 
the 
force 
of 
a 
given 
attack 
to 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
given 
detachment 
of 
the 
army 
(at 
the 
present 
time 
no 
one 
ever 
thinks 
of 
doing 
that, 
because 
in 
nine 
cases 
out 
of 
ten 
these 
attacks 
occur 
spontaneously), 
and 
would 
facilitate 
the 
"transportation" 
from 
one 
place 
to 
another, 
not 
only 
of 
literature, 
but 
also 
of 
revolutionary 
forces. 


At 
present 
these 
forces 
in 
a 
great 
many 
cases 
are 
being 
spent 
and 
bled 



on 
restricted 
local 
work, 
but 
under 
the 
circumstances 
we 
are 
discussing, 
there 
would 
be 
the 
possibility 
and 
occasion 
would 
constantly 
arise 
for 
transferring 
an 
agitator 
or 
organizer 
who 
is 
at 
all 
capable 
from 
one 
end 
of 
the 
country 
to 
another. 
Beginning 
with 
short 
journeys 
on 
Party 
business 
at 
the 
Party's 
expense, 
people 
would 
become 
accustomed 
to 
being 
maintained 
entirely 
by 
the 
Party, 
would 


become 
professional 
revolutionaries 
and 
would 
train 
themselves 
to 
be 
real 
political 
leaders. 


And 
if 
indeed 
we 
succeeded 
in 
reaching 
a 
point 
when 
all, 
or 
at 
least 
a 
considerable 
majority, 
of 
the 
local 
committees, 
local 
groups 
and 
circles 
actively 
took 
up 
work 
for 
the 
common 
cause, 
we 
could, 
in 
the 
not 
distant 
future, 
establish 
a 
weekly 
newspaper 
that 
would 
be 
regularly 
distributed 
in 
tens 
of 
thousands 
of 
copies 
over 
the 
whole 
of 
Russia. 
This 
newspaper 
would 
become 
a 
part 
of 
an 
enormous 
pair 
of 
smith's 
bellows 
that 
would 
fan 
every 
spark 
of 
class 
struggle 
and 
popular 
indignation 
into 
a 
general 
conflagration. 
Around 
what 
is 
in 
itself 
still 
a 
very 
innocent 
and 
very 
small, 
but 
a 
regular 
and 
common 
effort, 
in 
the 
full 
sense 
of 
the 
word, 
a 
regular 
army 
of 
tried 
warriors 
would 
systematically 
gather 
and 
receive 
their 
training. 
On 
the 
ladders 
and 
scaffolding 
of 
this 
general 
organizational 
structure 
there 
would 
soon 
develop 
and 
come 
to 
the 
fore 
Social-Democratic 
Zhelyabovs 
from 
among 
our 
revolutionaries 
and 
Russian 
Bebels 
from 
among 
our 
workers 
who 
would 
take 
their 
place 
at 
the 
head 
of 
the 
mobilized 
army 
and 
rouse 
the 
whole 
people 
to 
settle 
accounts 
with 
the 
shame 
and 
the 
curse 
of 
Russia. 


That 
is 
what 
we 
should 
dream 
of. 


*** 


"We 
should 
dream!" 
I 
wrote 
these 
words 
and 
became 
alarmed. 
I 
imagined 
myself 
sitting 
at 
a 
"unity 
congress" 
and 
opposite 
me 
were 
the 
editors 
and 
contributors 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo. 
Comrade 
Martynov 
rises 
and, 
turning 
to 
me, 
says 
sternly: 
"Permit 
me 
to 
ask 
you, 
has 
an 
autonomous 
editorial 
board 
the 
right 
to 
dream 
without 
first 
soliciting 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
Party 
committees?" 
He 
is 
followed 
by 


Comrade 
Krichevsky 
who 
(philosophically 
deepening 
Comrade 
Martynov 
who 
had 
long 
ago 
rendered 
Comrade 
Plekhanov 
more 
profound) 
continues 
even 
more 
sternly: 
"I 
go 
further. 
I 
ask, 
has 
a 
Marxist 
any 
right 
at 
all 
to 
dream, 
knowing 
that 
according 
to 
Marx 
mankind 
always 
sets 
itself 
such 
tasks 
as 
it 
can 
solve 
and 
that 
tactics 
is 
a 
process 
of 
growth 
of 
Party 
tasks, 



which 
grow 
together 
with 
the 
Party?" 


The 
very 
thought 
of 
these 
stern 
questions 
sends 
a 
cold 
shiver 
down 
my 
spine 
and 
makes 
me 
wish 
for 
nothing 
but 
a 
place 
to 
hide. 
I 
shall 
try 
to 
hide 
behind 
the 
back 
of 
Pisarev. 


"There 
are 
rifts 
and 
rifts," 
wrote 
Pisarev 
concerning 
the 
rift 
between 
dreams 
and 
reality. 
"My 
dream 
may 
run 
ahead 
of 
the 
natural 
march 
of 
events 
or 
may 
fly 
off 
at 
a 
tangent 
in 
a 
direction 
in 
which 
no 
natural 
march 
of 
events 
will 
ever 
proceed. 
In 
the 
first 
case 
my 
dream 
will 
not 
cause 
any 
harm; 
it 
may 
even 
support 
and 
augment 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
workingmen. 
. 
. 
. 
There 
is 
nothing 
in 
such 
dreams 
that 
would 
distort 
or 
paralyze 
labour 
power. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
if 
man 
were 
completely 
deprived 
of 
the 
ability 
to 
dream 
in 
this 
way, 
if 
he 
could 
not 
from 
time 
to 
time 
run 
ahead 
and 
mentally 
conceive, 
in 
an 
entire 
and 
completed 
picture, 
the 
product 
to 
which 
his 
hands 
are 
only 
just 
beginning 
to 
lend 
shape, 
then 
I 
cannot 
at 
all 
imagine 
what 
stimulus 
there 
would 
be 
to 
induce 
man 
to 
undertake 
and 
complete 
extensive 
and 
strenuous 
work 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
art, 
science 
and 
practical 
endeavour. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
rift 
between 
dreams 
and 
reality 
causes 
no 
harm 
if 
only 
the 
person 
dreaming 
believes 
seriously 
in 
his 
dream, 
if 
he 
attentively 
observes 
life, 
compares 
his 
observations 
with 
his 
castles 
in 
the 
air 
and 
if, 
generally 
speaking, 
he 
works 
conscientiously 
for 
the 
achievement 
of 
his 
fantasies. 
If 
there 
is 
some 
connection 
between 
dreams 
and 
life 
then 
all 
is 
well."[100] 


Of 
this 
kind 
of 
dreaming 
there 
is 
unfortunately 
too 
little 
in 
our 
movement. 
And 
the 
people 
most 
responsible 
for 
this 
are 
those 
who 
boast 
of 
their 
sober 
views, 
their 
"closeness" 
to 
the 
"concrete," 
the 
representatives 
of 
legal 
criticism 
and 
of 
illegal 
tail-ism. 



C. 
WHAT 
TYPE 
OF 
ORGANIZATION 
DO 
WE 
REQUIRE? 
From 
what 
has 
been 
said 
the 
reader 
will 
see 
that 
our 
"tactics-as-a-plan" 
consists 
in 
rejecting 
an 
immediate 
call 
for 
attack, 
in 
demanding 
"a 
regular 
siege 
of 
the 
enemy 
fortress," 
or 
in 
other 
words, 
in 
demanding 
that 
all 
efforts 
be 
directed 
towards 
gathering, 
organizing 
and 
mobilizing 
permanent 
troops. 
When 
we 
ridiculed 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
for 
its 
leap 
from 
Economism 
to 
shouting 
for 
an 
attack 
(for 
which 
it 
clamoured 
in 
April 
1901, 
in 
the 
Listok 
Rabochevo 
Dyela, 
No. 
6), 
it 
of 
course 
came 
down 
on 
us 
with 
accusations 
of 
being 
"doctrinaire," 
of 
failing 
to 
understand 
our 
revolutionary 
duty, 
of 
calling 
for 
caution, 
etc. 
Of 
course 
we 
were 
not 
in 
the 
least 
surprised 
to 
hear 
these 
accusations 
coming 
from 
those 
who 
totally 
lack 
principles 
and 
who 
evade 
all 
arguments 
by 
references 
to 
a 
profound 
"tactics-as-a-process," 
any 
more 
than 
we 
were 
surprised 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
these 
accusations 
were 
repeated 
by 
Nadezhdin, 
who 
in 
general 
has 
a 
supreme 
contempt 
for 
durable 
programs 
and 
the 
fundamentals 
of 
tactics. 


It 
is 
said 
that 
history 
does 
not 
repeat 
itself. 
But 
Nadezhdin 
is 
exerting 
every 
effort 
to 
cause 
it 
to 
repeat 
itself 
and 
he 
zealously 
imitates 
Tkachov 
in 
strongly 
condemning 
"revolutionary 
culturism," 
in 
shouting 
about 
"sounding 
the 
tocsin," 


about 
a 
special 
"eve-of-the-revolution 
point 
of 
view," 
etc. 
Apparently, 
he 
has 
forgotten 
the 
well-known 
maxim 
that 
while 
an 
original 
historical 
event 
represents 
a 
tragedy, 
the 
copy 
of 
it 
is 
only 
a 
farce.[101]The 
attempt 
to 
seize 
power, 
which 
had 
been 
prepared 
by 
the 
preaching 
of 
Tkachov 
and 
carried 
out 
by 
means 
of 
the 
"terrifying" 
terror 
which 
did 
really 
terrify, 
was 
majestic, 
but 
the 
"excitative" 
terror 
of 
a 
little 
Tkachov 
is 
simply 
ridiculous 
and 
is 
particularly 
ridiculous 
when 
supplemented 
by 
the 
idea 
of 
an 
organization 
of 
average 
workers. 


"If 
the 
Iskra 
would 
only 
emerge 
from 
its 
sphere 
of 
literariness," 
wrote 
Nadezhdin, 
"it 
would 
realize 
that 
these 
(instances 
like 
the 
worker's 
letter 
to 
the 
Iskra, 
No. 
7, 
etc.) 
are 
symptoms 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
soon, 
very 
soon 
that 
'attack' 
will 
commence, 
and 
to 
speak 
now 
(sic 
!) 
of 
an 
organization 
linked 
up 
with 
an 
all-Russian 
newspaper 
means 
propagating 
armchair 
ideas 
and 
armchair 
work." 
What 
an 
unimaginable 
muddle: 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
excitative 
terror 
and 
an 
"organization 
of 
average 
workers" 
along 
with 
the 
opinion 
that 
it 
is 
far 
"easier" 
to 
gather 
around 
something 
"more 
concrete," 
like 
a 
local 



newspaper 
--and 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
view 
to 
talk 
"now" 
about 
an 
all-
Russian 
organization 
means 
propagating 
armchair 
thoughts, 
or, 
to 
put 
it 
plainly 
and 
bluntly, 
"now" 
is 
already 
too 
late! 
But 
what 
about 
the 
"extensive 
organization 
of 
local 
newspapers" 
--is 
it 
not 
too 
late 
for 
that, 
my 
dear 
L. 
Nadezhdin? 
And 
compare 
with 
this 
the 
Iskra's 
point 
of 
view 
and 
tactics: 
excitative 
terror 
--is 
nonsense; 
to 
talk 
about 
an 
organization 
of 
average 
workers 
and 
about 
the 
extensive 
publication 
of 
local 
newspapers 
means 
opening 
the 
door 
wide 
to 
Economism. 
We 
must 
speak 
about 
a 
single 
all-
Russian 
organization 
of 
revolution


aries, 
and 
it 
will 
never 
be 
too 
late 
to 
talk 
about 
that 
until 
the 
real, 
and 
not 
paper, 
attack 
commences. 


"Yes, 
as 
far 
as 
organization 
is 
concerned 
the 
situation 
is 
anything 
but 
brilliant," 
continues 
Nadezhdin. 
"Yes, 
the 
Iskra 
is 
absolutely 
right 
when 
it 
says 
that 
the 
mass 
of 
our 
military 
forces 
consists 
of 
volunteers 
and 
insurgents. 
. 
. 
. 
You 
do 
well 
to 
give 
such 
a 
sober 
picture 
of 
the 
state 
of 
our 
forces. 
But 
why, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
do 
you 
forget 
that 
the 
crowd 
is 
not 
ours 
at 
all, 
and 
consequently, 
it 
will 
not 
ask 
us 
when 
to 
commence 
military 
operations, 
it 
will 
simply 
go 
and 
'rebel'. 
. 
. 
. 
When 
the 
crowd 
itself 
breaks 
out 
with 
its 
elemental 
destructive 
force 
it 
may 
overwhelm 
and 
brush 
aside 
the 
'regular 
troops' 
among 
whom 
we 
had 
been 
preparing 
all 
the 
time 
to 
introduce 
the 
extremely 
systematic 
organization, 
but 
had 
never 
managed 
to 
do 
so." 
(Our 
italics.) 


Astonishing 
logic! 
Precisely 
because 
the 
"crowd 
is 
not 
ours," 
it 
is 
stupid 
and 
unseemly 
to 
shout 
about 
"attack" 
this 
very 
minute, 
because 
an 
attack 
means 
assault 
by 
regular 
troops 
and 
not 
a 
spontaneous 
outburst 
of 
the 
crowd. 
It 
is 
precisely 
because 
the 
crowd 
may 
overwhelm 
and 
brush 
aside 
the 
regular 
troops 
that 
we 
must 
without 
fail 
"manage 
to 
keep 
up" 
with 
the 
spontaneous 
upsurge 
by 
our 
work 
of 
"introducing 
extremely 
systematic 
organization" 
among 
the 
regular 
troops, 
for 
the 
more 
we 
"manage" 
to 
introduce 
such 
organization 
the 
more 
probable 
will 
it 
be 
that 
the 
regular 
troops 
will 
not 
be 
overwhelmed 
by 
the 
crowd, 
but 
will 
take 
their 
place 
in 
front 
at 
the 
head 
of 
the 
crowd. 
Nadezhdin 
is 
confused 
because 
he 
imagines 
that 
troops, 
which 
are 
being 
systematically 
organized, 
are 
engaged 
in 
something 
that 
isolates 
them 
from 
the 
crowd, 
when 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
they 
are 
engaged 
exclusively 
in 
all-sided 
and 
all-embracing 
political 
agitation, 
i.e., 
precisely 
in 
work 
that 
brings 
closer 
and 
merges 
into 
a 
single 
whole 
the 
elemental 
destructive 
force 
of 
the 
crowd 
and 
the 
conscious 
destructive 
force 
of 
the 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries. 
You, 
gentlemen, 
wish 
to 
lay 
the 



blame 
where 
it 
does 
not 
belong. 
For 
it 
is 
precisely 
the 
Svoboda 
group 
that, 
by 
including 
terror 
in 
its 
program, 
calls 
for 
an 
organization 
of 
terrorists, 
and 
such 
an 
organization 
would 
indeed 
prevent 
our 
troops 
from 
coming 
closer 
to 
the 
crowd, 
which, 
unfortunately, 
is 
still 
not 
ours, 
and 
which, 
unfortunately, 
does 
not 
yet 
ask 
us, 
or 
rarely 
asks 
us 
when 
and 
how 
to 
commence 
military 
operations. 


"We 
will 
miss 
the 
revolution 
itself," 
continues 
Nadezhdin 
in 
his 
attempt 
to 
scare 
the 
Iskra, 
"in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
we 
missed 
the 
recent 
events 
which 
came 
upon 
us 
like 
a 
bolt 
from 
the 
blue." 
This 
sentence 
taken 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
one 
quoted 
above 
clearly 
demonstrates 
the 
absurdity 
of 
the 
"eve-of-the-revolution 
point 
of 
view" 
specially 
invented 
by 
the 
Svoboda.* 
To 
put 
it 
candidly, 
this 
special 
"point 
of 
view" 
boils 
down 
to 
this: 
it 
is 
too 
late 
"now" 
to 
discuss 
and 
prepare. 
If 
that 
is 
the 
case, 
oh 
most 
worthy 
opponent 
of 
"literariness," 
what 
was 
the 
use 
of 
writing 
a 
pamphlet 
of 
132 
pages 
on 
"questions 
of 
theory** 
and 
tactics"? 
Don't 


* 
The 
Eve 
of 
Revolution, 
p. 
62. 
** 
In 
his 
Review 
of 
Questions 
of 
Theory, 
L. 
Nadezhdin, 
by 
the 
way, 
made 
almost 
no 
contribution 
whatever 
to 
the 
discussion 
of 
questions 
of 
theory 
apart, 
perhaps, 
from 
the 
following 
passage, 
which 
is 
a 
very 
peculiar 
one 
from 
the 
"eve-of-the-revolution 
point 
of 
view": 
"Bernsteinism, 
on 
the 
whole, 
is 
losing 
its 
acuteness 
for 
us 
at 
the 
present 
moment, 
as 
also 
is 
the 
question 
as 
to 
whether 
Mr. 
Adamovich 
has 
proved 
that 
Mr. 
Struve 
has 
already 
deserved 
distinction, 
or 
on 
the 
contrary 
whether 
Mr. 
Struve 
will 
refute 
Mr. 
Adamovich 
and 
will 
refuse 
to 
resign‹it 
really 
makes 
no 
difference, 
because 
the 
hour 
of 
revolution 
has 
struck." 
(P. 
110.) 
One 
can 
hardly 
imagine 
a 
more 
striking 
illustration 
of 
L. 
Nadezhdin's 
infinite 
disregard 
for 
theory. 
We 
have 
proclaimed 
"the 
eve 
of 
the 
revolution," 
therefore 
"it 
really 
makes 
no 
difference" 
whether 
the 
orthodoxians 
will 
succeed 
in 
finally 
driving 
the 
critics 
from 
their 
positions 
or 
not!! 
And 
our 
wiseacre 
fails 
to 
see 
that 
it 
is 
precisely 
during 
the 
revolution 
that 
we 
shall 
stand 
in 
need 
of 
the 
results 
of 
our 
theoretical 
battles 
with 
the 
critics 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
resolutely 
to 
combat 
their 
practical 
positions! 
you 
think 
it 
would 
have 
been 
more 
becoming 
for 
"the 
eve-of-therevolution 
point 
of 
view" 
to 
have 
issued 
132,000 
leaflets 
containing 
the 
brief 
call: 
"Beat 
them 
up"? 


Those 
who 
make 
nation-wide 
political 
agitation 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
their 
program, 
their 
tactics 
and 
their 
organizational 
work 
as 
the 
Iskra 
does, 
stand 
in 
least 
risk 
of 
missing 
the 
revolution. 
The 
people 
who 
were 
engaged 
over 
the 



whole 
of 
Russia 
in 
spinning 
the 
network 
of 
organizations 
linked 
up 
with 
an 
all-Russian 
newspaper 
not 
only 
did 
not 
miss 
the 
spring 
events, 
but, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
enabled 
us 
to 
foretell 
them. 
Nor 
did 
they 
miss 
the 
demonstrations 
that 
were 
described 
in 
the 
Iskra, 
Nos. 
13 
and 
14; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
they 
took 
part 
in 
those 
demonstrations, 
clearly 
appreciating 
their 
duty 
of 
coming 
to 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
spontaneously 
rising 
crowd 
and, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
through 
the 
medium 
of 
the 
newspaper, 
helping 
all 
the 
comrades 
in 
Russia 
to 
become 
more 
closely 
acquainted 
with 
the 
demonstrations 
and 
to 
utilize 
their 
experience. 
And 
if 
they 
live 
they 
will 
not 
miss 
the 
revolution 
which 
first 
and 
foremost 
will 
demand 
of 
us 
experience 
in 
agitation, 
ability 
to 
support 
(in 
a 
Social-Democratic 
manner) 
every 
protest, 
ability 
to 
direct 
the 
spontaneous 
movement, 
while 
safeguarding 
it 
from 
the 
mistakes 
of 
friends 
and 
the 
traps 
of 
enemies! 


We 
have 
thus 
come 
to 
the 
last 
reason 
that 
compels 
us 
so 
strongly 
to 
insist 
upon 
a 
plan 
of 
organization 
centred 
around 
an 
all-Russian 
newspaper, 
by 
means 
of 
joint 
work 
for 
a 
common 
newspaper. 
Only 
such 
organization 
will 
ensure 
the 
flexibility 
required 
of 
a 
militant 
Social-Democratic 
organization, 
i.e., 
the 
ability 
to 
adapt 
itself 
immediately 
to 
the 
most 
diverse 
and 
rapidly 
changing 
conditions 
of 
struggle, 
the 
ability, 
"on 
the 
one 
hand, 
to 
avoid 
open 
battle 
with 
an 
enemy 
of 
overwhelming 
strength 
when 
he 
has 
concentrated 


all 
his 
forces 
at 
one 
spot 
and, 
on 
the 
other, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
awkwardness 
of 
this 
enemy 
and 
attack 
him 
whenever 
and 
wherever 
he 
least 
expects.[*] 
It 
would 
be 
a 
grievous 
error 
indeed 
to 
build 
up 
the 
Party 
organization 
in 
anticipation 
only 
of 
outbreaks 
and 
street 
fighting, 
or 
only 
upon 
the 
"forward 
march 
of 
the 
drab 
everyday 
struggle." 
We 
must 
always 
conduct 
our 
everyday 
work 
and 
always 
be 
prepared 
for 
everything, 
because 
very 
frequently 
it 
is 
almost 
impossible 
to 
foresee 
when 
periods 
of 
outbreaks 
will 
give 
way 
to 
periods 
of 
calm. 
And 
in 
those 
cases 
when 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
do 
so, 
it 
will 
not 
be 
possible 
to 
utilize 
this 
foresight 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
reconstructing 
our 
organization, 
because 
in 
an 
autocratic 
country 
these 
changes 
take 
place 
with 
astonishing 
rapidity, 
being 
sometimes 
connected 
with 
a 
single 
night 
raid 
by 
the 
tsarist 
janizaries.[102] 
And 
the 
revolution 
itself 
must 
not 
by 
any 
means 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
single 
act 
(as 
the 
Nadezhdins 
apparently 
imagine) 
but 
as 
a 
series 
of 
more 
or 
less 
powerful 
outbreaks 
rapidly 
alternating 
with 
periods 
of 
more 
or 
less 
intense 
calm. 
For 
that 
reason, 
the 
principal 
content 
of 
the 
activity 
of 
our 
Party 
organization,

"Where 
To 
Begin?" 
"Revolutionary 
culturists, 
who 
do 
not 
accept 
the 
eve-of-the-revolution 
point 
of 
view, 
are 
not 
in 
the 
least 
perturbed 
by 
the 
prospect 
of 
working 
for 
a 
long 
period 
of 
time," 
writes 
Nadezhdin. 
(P. 
62.) 
To 
this 
we 
shall 
remark: 
unless 
we 
are 
able 
to 
devise 
political 
tactics 
and 
an 
organizational 
plan 
designed 
for 
work 
over 
a 
very 
long 
period 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
by 
the 
very 
process 
of 
this 
work, 
ensure 
our 
Party's 
readiness 
to 
be 
at 
its 
post 
and 
fulfil 
its 
duty 
in 
every 
contingency 
whenever 
the 
march 
of 
events 
is 
accelerated, 
we 
shall 
prove 
to 
be 
but 
miserable 
political 
adventurers. 
Only 
Nadezhdin, 
who 
began 
to 
describe 
himself 
as 
a 
Social-Democrat 
but 
yesterday, 
can 
forget 
that 
the 
aim 
of 
Social-
Democracy 
is 
radically 
to 
transform 
the 
conditions 
of 
life 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
humanity 
and 
that 
for 
that 
reason 
it 
is 
not 
permissible 
for 
a 
Social-Democrat 
to 
be 
"perturbed" 
by 
the 
question 
of 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
work. 
the 
focus 
of 
this 
activity, 
should 
be 
work 
that 
is 
possible 
and 
necessary 
in 
the 
period 
of 
the 
most 
powerful 
outbreaks 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
period 
of 
complete 
calm, 
namely, 
work 
of 
political 
agitation, 
linked 
up 
over 
the 
whole 
of 
Russia, 
illuminating 
all 
aspects 
of 
life 
and 
conducted 
among 
the 
broadest 
possible 
strata 
of 
the 
masses. 
But 
this 
work 
is 
unthinkable 
in 
contemporary 
Russia 
without 
an 
all-Russian 
newspaper, 
issued 
very 
frequently. 
The 
organization 
which 
will 
form 
around 
this 
newspaper, 
an 
organization 
of 
its 
collaborators 
(in 
the 
broad 
sense 
of 
the 
word, 
i.e., 
all 
those 
working 
for 
it), 
will 
be 
ready 
for 
everything, 
from 
upholding 
the 
honour, 
the 
prestige 
and 
continuity 
of 
the 
Party 
in 
periods 
of 
acute 
revolutionary 
"depression," 
to 
preparing 
for, 
fixing 
the 
time 
for 
and 
carrying 
out 
the 
nation-wide 
armed 
insurrection. 


Indeed, 
picture 
to 
yourselves 
a 
very 
ordinary 
occurrence 
in 
Russia 
-the 
complete 
discovery 
and 
arrest 
of 
our 
organization 
in 
one 
or 
several 
localities. 
With 
all 
the 
local 
organizations 
lacking 
a 
single, 
common 
regular 
task, 
such 
raids 
frequently 
result 
in 
the 
interruption 
of 
our 
work 
for 
many 
months. 
If, 
however, 
all 
the 
local 
organizations 
had 
one 
common 
task, 
then, 
even 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a 
very 
serious 
raid, 
two 
or 
three 
energetic 
persons 
could 
in 
the 
course 
of 
a 
few 
weeks 
establish 
new 
youth 
circles, 
which, 
as 
is 
well 
known, 
spring 
up 
very 
quickly 
even 
now, 
and 
bring 
them 
into 
contact 
with 
the 
common 
centre. 
And 
when 
the 
common 
task, 
hampered 
by 
the 
raid, 
is 
apparent 
to 
all, 
new 
circles 
could 
come 
into 
being 
and 
make 
connections 
with 
the 
centre 
even 
more 
rapidly. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
picture 
to 
yourselves 
a 
popular 
uprising. 
Probably 



everyone 
will 
now 
agree 
that 
we 
must 
think 
of 
this 
and 
prepare 
for 
it. 
But 
how? 
Surely 
the 
Central 
Committee 
cannot 
appoint 
agents 
to 
all 
localities 
for 
the 


purpose 
of 
preparing 
for 
the 
uprising! 
Even 
if 
we 
had 
a 
Central 
Committee 
it 
could 
achieve 
absolutely 
nothing 
by 
such 
appointments 
under 
present-day 
Russian 
conditions. 
But 
a 
network 
of 
agents[*] 
that 
would 
form 
in 
the 
course 
of 
establishing 
and 
distributing 
a 
common 
newspaper 
would 
not 
have 
to 
"sit 
around 
and 
wait" 
for 
the 
call 
for 
an 
uprising, 
but 
could 
carry 
on 
the 
regular 
work 
that 
would 
guarantee 
the 
highest 
probability 
of 
success 
in 
the 
event 
of 
an 
uprising. 
Such 
work 
would 
strengthen 
our 
contacts 
with 
the 
broadest 
strata 
of 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers 
and 
with 
all 
those 
strata 
who 
are 
discontented 
with 
the 
autocracy, 
which 
is 
of 
such 
importance 
for 
an 
uprising. 
It 
is 
precisely 
such 
work 
that 
would 
serve 
to 
cultivate 
the 
ability 
properly 
to 
estimate 
the 
general 
political 
situation 
and, 
consequently, 
the 
ability 
to 
select 
the 
proper 
moment 
for 
the 
uprising. 
It 
is 
precisely 
such 
work 
that 
would 
train 
all 
local 
organizations 
to 
respond 
simultaneously 
to 
one 
and 
the 
same 
political 
questions, 
incidents 
and 
events 
that 
agitate 
the 
whole 
of 
Russia, 
to 
react 
to 
these 
"incidents" 
in 
the 
most 
vigorous, 
uniform 
and 
expedient 
manner 
possible; 
for 
an 
uprising 
is 
in 
essence 
the 
most 
vigorous, 
most 
uniform 
and 
most 
expedient 
"reaction" 


* 
Alas, 
alas! 
Again 
I 
have 
let 
slip 
that 
awful 
word 
"agents" 
which 
jars 
so 
much 
on 
the 
democratic 
ears 
of 
the 
Martynovs! 
I 
wonder 
why 
this 
word 
did 
not 
offend 
the 
sensibilities 
of 
the 
heroes 
of 
the 
'seventies 
and 
yet 
offends 
the 
amateurs 
of 
the 
'nineties? 
I 
like 
the 
word, 
because 
it 
clearly 
and 
trenchantly 
indicates 
the 
common 
cause 
to 
which 
all 
the 
agents 
bend 
their 
thoughts 
and 
actions, 
and 
if 
I 
had 
to 
replace 
this 
word 
by 
another, 
the 
only 
word 
I 
might 
select 
would 
be 
the 
word 
"collaborator," 
if 
it 
did 
not 
suggest 
a 
certain 
literariness 
and 
diffusiveness. 
The 
thing 
we 
need 
is 
a 
military 
organization 
of 
agents. 
However, 
the 
numerous 
Martynovs 
(particularly 
abroad) 
whose 
favourite 
pastime 
is 
"mutual 
promotion 
of 
each 
other 
to 
the 
post 
of 
general" 
may 
instead 
of 
saying 
"passport 
agent" 
prefer 
to 
say, 
"Chief 
of 
the 
Special 
Department 
for 
Supplying 
Revolutionists 
With 
Passports." 
etc. 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
people 
to 
the 
conduct 
of 
the 
government. 
And 
lastly, 
it 
is 
precisely 
such 
work 
that 
would 
train 
all 
revolutionary 
organizations 
throughout 
Russia 
to 
maintain 
the 
most 
continuous, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
most 
secret, 
contact 
with 
each 
other, 
thus 
creating 
real 
Party 
unity 
--for 
without 
such 
contacts 
it 
will 
be 
impossible 
collectively 
to 
discuss 
the 
plan 
of 



the 
uprising 
and 
take 
the 
necessary 
preparatory 
measures 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
it, 
which 
must 
be 
kept 
in 
the 
strictest 
secrecy. 


In 
a 
word, 
the 
"plan 
for 
an 
all-Russian 
political 
newspaper," 
far 
from 
representing 
the 
fruits 
of 
the 
labour 
of 
armchair 
workers, 
infected 
with 
dogmatism 
and 
literariness 
(as 
it 
seemed 
to 
those 
who 
gave 
but 
little 
thought 
to 
it), 
is 
a 
most 
practical 
plan 
for 
immediate 
and 
all-round 
preparations 
for 
the 
uprising, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
never 
for 
a 
moment 
forgetting 
our 
ordinary, 
everyday 
work. 



Conclusion 


The 
history 
of 
Russian 
Social-Democracy 
can 
be 
distinctly 
divided 
into 
three 
periods: 


The 
first 
period 
covers 
about 
ten 
years, 
approximately 
the 
years 
1884 
to 
1894. 
This 
was 
the 
period 
of 
the 
rise 
and 
consolidation 
of 
the 
theory 
and 
program 
of 
Social-Democracy. 
The 
number 
of 
adherents 
of 
the 
new 
trend 
in 
Russia 
could 
be 
counted 
in 
units. 
Social-Democracy 
existed 
without 
a 
working-class 
movement; 
as 
a 
political 
party 
it 
was 
undergoing 
a 
process 
of 
foetal 
development. 


The 
second 
period 
covers 
three 
or 
four 
years 
--1894-98. 
In 
this 
period 
Social-Democracy 
appeared 
on 
the 
scene 
as 
a 
social 
movement, 
as 
the 
upsurge 
of 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
people, 
as 
a 
political 
party. 
This 
is 
the 
period 
of 
its 
childhood 
and 
adolescence. 
With 
the 
speed 
of 
an 
epidemic 
there 
spread 
among 
the 
intelligentsia 
a 
universal 
passion 
to 
fight 
Narodism 
and 
go 
among 
the 
workers; 
a 
universal 
passion 
among 
the 
workers 
for 
strike 
action. 
The 
movement 
made 
enormous 
strides. 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
leaders 
were 
quite 
young 
people 
who 
had 
by 
no 
means 
reached 
"the 
age 
of 
thirty-five" 
which 
to 
Mr. 
N. 
Mikhailovsky 
appeared 
to 
be 


a 
sort 
of 
natural 
border 
line. 
Owing 
to 
their 
youth, 
they 
proved 
to 
be 
untrained 
for 
practical 
work 
and 
they 
left 
the 
scene 
with 
astonishing 
rapidity. 
But 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
cases 
the 
scope 
of 
their 
work 
was 
very 
wide. 
Many 
of 
them 
began 
their 
revolutionary 
thinking 
as 
adherents 
of 
Narodnaya 
Volya. 
Nearly 
all 
of 
them 
in 
their 
early 
youth 
enthusiastically 
worshipped 
the 
terrorist 
heroes. 
It 
required 
a 
struggle 
to 
abandon 
the 
captivating 
impressions 
of 
these 
heroic 
traditions, 
and 
it 
was 
accompanied 
by 
the 
break 
of 
personal 
relations 
with 
people 
who 
were 
determined 
to 
remain 
loyal 
to 
the 
Narodnaya 
Volya 
and 
for 
whom 
the 
young 
Social-Democrats 
had 
profound 
respect. 
The 
struggle 
compelled 
them 
to 
educate 
themselves, 
to 
read 
the 
illegal 
literature 
of 
diverse 
tendencies 
and 
to 
study 
closely 
the 
questions 
of 
legal 
Narodism. 
Trained 
in 
this 
struggle, 
Social-Democrats 
went 
into 
the 
working-class 
movement 
without 
"for 
a 
moment" 
forgetting 
the 
theory 
of 
Marxism 
which 
brightly 
illuminated 
their 
path, 
or 
the 
task 
of 
overthrowing 
the 
autocracy. 
The 
formation 
of 
the 
Party 
in 
the 
spring 
of 
1898 
was 
the 
most 
striking 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
last 
act 
of 
the 
Social-Democrats 
of 
this 
period. 


The 
third 
period, 
as 
we 
have 
seen, 
was 
prepared 
in 
1897 
and 
definitely 



replaced 
the 
second 
period 
in 
1898 
(1898-?). 
This 
was 
a 
period 
of 
disunity, 
dissolution 
and 
vacillation. 
In 
the 
period 
of 
adolescence 
a 
youth's 
voice 
breaks. 
And 
so, 
in 
this 
period, 
the 
voice 
of 
Russian 
Social-Democracy 
began 
to 
break, 
began 
to 
strike 
a 
false 
note 
--on 
the 
one 
hand, 
in 
the 
productions 
of 
Messrs. 
Struve 
and 
Prokopovich, 
Bulgakov 
and 
Berdyaev, 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
in 
the 
productions 
of 
V. 
I-n 
and 
R. 
M., 
B. 
Krichevsky 
and 
Martynov. 
But 
it 
was 
only 
the 
leaders 
who 
wandered 


about 
separately 
and 
went 
back; 
the 
movement 
itself 
continued 
to 
grow, 
and 
advanced 
with 
enormous 
strides. 
The 
proletarian 
struggle 
spread 
to 
new 
strata 
of 
the 
workers, 
extended 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
Russia 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
indirectly 
stimulated 
the 
revival 
of 
the 
democratic 
spirit 
among 
the 
students 
and 
among 
other 
strata 
of 
the 
population. 
The 
consciousness 
of 
the 
leaders, 
however, 
failed 
to 
face 
up 
to 
the 
breadth 
and 
power 
of 
the 
spontaneous 
upsurge; 
among 
Social-Democrats, 
a 
different 
brand 
predominated 
--a 
brand 
of 
Party 
workers 
who 
had 
been 
trained 
almost 
exclusively 
on 
"legal 
Marxist" 
literature 
which 
proved 
to 
be 
all 
the 
more 
inadequate 
the 
more 
the 
spontaneity 
of 
the 
masses 
called 
for 
consciousness. 
The 
leaders 
not 
only 
lagged 
behind 
in 
regard 
to 
theory 
("freedom 
of 
criticism") 
and 
practice 
("amateurishness"), 
but 
tried 
to 
justify 
their 
backwardness 
by 
all 
sorts 
of 
high-flown 
arguments. 
Social-Democracy 
was 
degraded 
to 
the 
level 
of 
trade 
unionism 
by 
the 
Brentano-ites 
in 
legal 
literature, 
and 
by 
the 
tail-enders 
in 
illegal 
literature. 
The 
Credo 
program 
began 
to 
be 
put 
into 
operation, 
especially 
when 
the 
"amateurishness" 
of 
the 
Social-Democrats 
caused 
a 
revival 
of 
revolutionary 
non-Social-Democratic 
tendencies. 


And 
if 
the 
reader 
reproaches 
me 
for 
having 
dealt 
in 
excessive 
detail 
with 
a 
certain 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
I 
shall 
say 
to 
him 
in 
reply: 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
acquired 
"historical" 
significance 
because 
it 
most 
strikingly 
reflected 
the 
"spirit" 
of 
this 
third 
period.* 
It 
was 
not 
the 
consistent 
R.M. 
but 


* 
I 
could 
also 
reply 
with 
the 
German 
proverb: 
Den 
Sack 
schlägt 
man, 
den 
Esel 
meint 
man 
(you 
beat 
the 
sack, 
but 
the 
blows 
are 
intended 
for 
the 
ass). 
It 
was 
not 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
alone, 
but 
also 
the 
mass 
of 
practical 
workers 
and 
theoreticians 
that 
was 
carried 
away 
by 
the 
fashion 
[cont. 
onto 
p. 
224. 
--DJR] 
of 
"criticism," 
they 
became 
confused 
on 
the 
question 
of 
spontaneity 
and 
lapsed 
from 
the 
Social-Democratic 
to 
the 
trade-unionist 
conception 
of 
our 
political 
and 
organizational 
tasks. 
the 
weathercock 
Krichevskys 
and 
Martynovs 
who 
could 
properly 
express 
the 
disunity 
and 
vacillation, 
the 
readiness 
to 
make 
concessions 
to 
"criticism," 



to 
"Economism" 
and 
to 
terrorism. 
It 
is 
not 
the 
lofty 
contempt 
for 
practical 
work 
displayed 
by 
some 
worshipper 
of 
the 
"absolute" 
that 
is 
characteristic 
of 
this 
period, 
but 
the 
combination 
of 
pettyfogging 
practice 
and 
utter 
disregard 
for 
theory. 
It 
was 
not 
so 
much 
the 
downright 
rejection 
of 
"great 
watchwords" 
that 
the 
heroes 
of 
this 
period 
engaged 
in 
as 
in 
their 
vulgarization: 
scientific 
Socialism 
ceased 
to 
be 
an 
integral 
revolutionary 
theory 
and 
became 
a 
hodgepodge 
"freely" 
diluted 
with 
the 
contents 
of 
every 
new 
German 
textbook 
that 
appeared; 
the 
slogan 
"class 
struggle" 
did 
not 
impel 
them 
forward 
to 
wider 
and 
more 
strenuous 
activity 
but 
served 
as 
a 
soothing 
syrup, 
because 
the 
"economic 
struggle 
is 
inseparably 
linked 
up 
with 
the 
political 
struggle"; 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
party 
did 
not 
serve 
as 
a 
call 
for 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
militant 
organization 
of 
revolutionaries, 
but 
was 
used 
to 
justify 
some 
sort 
of 
a 
"revolutionary 
bureaucracy" 
and 
infantile 
playing 
at 
"democratic" 
forms. 


When 
this 
third 
period 
will 
come 
to 
an 
end 
and 
the 
fourth 
begin 
we 
do 
not 
know 
(at 
all 
events 
it 
is 
already 
heralded 
by 
many 
signs). 
We 
are 
passing 
from 
the 
sphere 
of 
history 
to 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
present 
and, 
partly, 
of 
the 
future. 
But 
we 
firmly 
believe 
that 
the 
fourth 
period 
will 
lead 
to 
the 
consolidation 
of 
militant 
Marxism, 
that 
Russian 
Social-Democracy 
will 
emerge 
from 
the 
crisis 
in 
the 
full 
strength 
of 
manhood, 
that 
the 
opportunist 
rearguard 
will 
be 
"replaced" 
by 
the 
genuine 
vanguard 
of 
the 
most 
revolutionary 
class. 


In 
the 
sense 
of 
calling 
for 
such 
a 
"replacement" 
and 
summing 
up, 
as 
it 
were, 
all 
that 
has 
been 
expounded 
above, 
we 
may 
give 
the 
following 
brief 
reply 
to 
the 
question, 
What 
is 
to 
be 
done?: 


Liquidate 
the 
Third 
Period. 



Appendix 


THE 
ATTEMPT 
TO 
UNITE 
THE 
ISKRA 
WITH 
THE 
RABOCHEYE 
DYELO 


It 
remains 
for 
us 
to 
describe 
the 
tactics 
the 
Iskra 
adopted 
and 
consistently 
pursued 
in 
its 
organizational 
relations 
with 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo. 
These 
tactics 
have 
already 
been 
fully 
expressed 
in 
theIskra, 
No. 
1, 
in 
an 
article 
entitled 
"The 
Split 
of 
the 
Union 
of 
Russian 
Social-Democrats 
Abroad."[104] 
From 
the 
outset 
we 
adopted 
the 
point 
of 
view 
that 
the 
real 
Union 
of 
Russian 
Social-Democrats 
Abroad, 
which 
at 
the 
first 
congress 
of 
our 
Party 
was 
recognized 
as 
its 
representative 
abroad, 
had 
split 
into 
two 
organizations; 
that 
the 
question 
of 
the 
Party's 
representation 
remains 
an 
open 
one, 
having 
been 
settled 
only 
temporarily 
and 
conditionally 
by 
the 
election 
at 
the 
International 
Congress 
at 
Paris 
of 
two 
members 
to 
represent 
Russia 
on 
the 
International 
Socialist 
Bureau, 
one 
from 
each 
of 
the 
two 
sections 
of 
the 
divided 
Union. 
We 
declared 
that 
fundamentally 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
was 
wrong 
; 
in 
principle 
we 
emphatically 
took 
the 
side 
of 
the 
Emancipation 
of 
Labour 
group, 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
we 
refused 
to 
enter 
into 
the 
details 
of 
the 
split 
and 
noted 
the 
services 
rendered 
by 
the 
Union 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
purely 
practical 
work.[*] 


Consequently, 
ours 
was, 
to 
a 
certain 
extent, 
a 
waiting 
policy; 
we 
made 
a 
concession 
to 
the 
opinions 
prevailing 
among 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
Russian 
Social-Democrats 
that 
the 
most 
determined 
opponents 
of 
Economism 
could 
work 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
the 
Union 
because 
the 
Union 
had 
frequently 
declared 
its 
agreement 
in 
principle 
with 
the 
Emancipation 
of 
Labour 
group, 
without, 
apparently, 
claiming 
independence 
on 
fundamental 
questions 
of 
theory 
and 
tactics. 
The 
correctness 
of 
our 
position 
was 
indirectly 
proved 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
almost 
simultaneously 
with 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
first 
issue 
of 
the 
Iskra 
(December 
1900) 
three 
members 
separated 
from 
the 
Union, 
formed 
the 
so-called 
"Group 
of 
Initiators" 
and 
offered 
their 
services: 
1. 
to 
the 
foreign 
section 
of 
the 
Iskra 
organization; 
2. 
to 
the 
Revolutionary 
Sotsial-
Demokrat 
Organization; 
and 
3. 
to 
the 
Union 
as 
mediators 
in 
negotiations 
for 
reconciliation. 
The 
first 
two 
organizations 
at 
once 
announced 
their 
agreement, 
the 
third 
turned 
down 
the 
offer. 
True, 
when 
a 
speaker 
related 
these 
facts 
at 
the 
"Unity" 
Congress 
last 
year, 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Managing 
Committee 
of 
the 
Union 
declared 
that 
their 
rejection 
of 
the 
offer 
was 



due 
entirely 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Union 
was 
dissatisfied 
with 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
Initiators' 
Group. 
While 
I 
consider 
it 
my 
duty 
to 
quote 
this 
explanation 
I 
cannot, 
however, 
refrain 
from 
observing 
that 
it 
is 
an 
unsatisfactory 
one: 
knowing 
that 
two 
organizations 
had 
agreed 
to 
enter 
into 
negotiations, 
the 
Union 
could 
have 
approached 
them 
through 
other 
intermediaries, 
or 
directly. 


* 
Our 
opinion 
of 
the 
split 
was 
based 
not 
only 
upon 
a 
perusal 
of 
the 
literature 
on 
the 
subject 
but 
also 
on 
information 
gathered 
abroad 
by 
several 
members 
of 
our 
organization. 
In 
the 
spring 
of 
1901 
both 
the 
Zarya 
(No. 
1, 
April) 
and 
the 
Iskra 
(No. 
4, 
May) 
entered 
into 
open 
polemics 
with 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo. 


[105] 
The 
Iskra 
particularly 
attacked 
the 
"historical 
turn" 
taken 
by 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
which, 
in 
its 
April 
supplement, 
that 
is, 
after 
the 
spring 
events, 
revealed 
instability 
on 
the 
question 
of 
terror 
and 
the 
calls 
for 
"blood," 
with 
which 
many 
had 
been 
carried 
away 
at 
the 
time. 
Notwithstanding 
these 
polemics, 
the 
Union 
agreed 
to 
the 
resumption 
of 
negotiations 
for 
reconciliation 
through 
the 
mediation 
of 
a 
new 
group 
of 
"conciliators." 
A 
preliminary 
conference 
of 
representatives 
of 
the 
three 
organizations 
named 
above 
took 
place 
in 
June 
and 
framed 
a 
draft 
agreement 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
very 
detailed 
"agreement 
on 
principles" 
that 
the 
Union 
published 
in 
the 
pamphlet 
Two 
Congresses 
and 
the 
League 
in 
the 
pamphlet 
Documents 
of 
the 
"Unity" 
Congress. 
The 
contents 
of 
this 
agreement 
on 
principles 
(or 
as 
it 
is 
more 
frequently 
named, 
the 
Resolutions 
of 
the 
June 
Conference), 
make 
it 
perfectly 
clear 
that 
we 
put 
forward 
as 
an 
absolute 
condition 
for 
unity 
the 
most 
emphatic 
repudiation 
of 
all 
and 
every 
manifestation 
of 
opportunism 
generally, 
and 
of 
Russian 
opportunism 
in 
particular. 
Paragraph 
I 
reads: 
"We 
repudiate 
all 
and 
every 
attempt 
to 
introduce 
opportunism 
into 
the 
proletarian 
class 
struggle 
--attempts 
which 
have 
found 
expression 
in 
so-called 
Economism, 
Bernsteinism, 
Millerandism, 
etc." 
"The 
sphere 
of 
Social-
Democratic 
activities 
includes 
. 
. 
. 
ideological 
struggle 
against 
all 
opponents 
of 
revolutionary 
Marxism" 
(4, 
c); 
"In 
every 
sphere 
of 
organizational 
and 
agitational 
activity 
Social-Democracy 
must 
not 
for 
a 
moment 
forget 
that 
the 
immediate 
task 
of 
the 
Russian 
proletariat 
is 
--to 
overthrow 
the 
autocracy" 
(5, 
a); 
". 
. 
. 
agitation, 
not 
only 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
everyday 
struggle 
between 
wage 
labour 
and 
capital" 
(5, 
b); 
". 
. 
. 
not 
recognizing 
. 
. 
. 
a 


stage 
of 
purely 
economic 
struggle 
and 
of 
struggle 
for 
partial 
political 
demands" 
(5, 
c); 
". 
. 
. 
we 
consider 
it 
important 
for 
the 
movement 
to 
criticize 



tendencies 
that 
make 
a 
principle 
of 
the 
primitiveness 
. 
. 
. 
and 
narrowness 
of 
the 
lower 
forms 
of 
the 
movement" 
(5, 
d). 
Even 
a 
complete 
outsider, 
who 
has 
read 
these 
resolutions 
at 
all 
attentively, 
will 
have 
realized 
from 
the 
very 
way 
in 
which 
they 
are 
formulated 
that 
they 
are 
directed 
against 
people 
who 
were 
opportunists 
and 
"Economists," 
who, 
even 
for 
a 
moment, 
forget 
about 
the 
task 
of 
overthrowing 
the 
autocracy, 
who 
recognize 
the 
theory 
of 
stages, 
who 
have 
elevated 
narrowness 
to 
a 
principle, 
etc. 
And 
anyone 
who 
has 
the 
least 
acquaintance 
with 
the 
polemics 
conducted 
by 
the 
Emancipation 
of 
Labour 
group, 
the 
Zarya 
and 
the 
Iskra 
against 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
cannot 
doubt 
for 
a 
single 
moment 
that 
these 
resolutions 
repudiate, 
point 
by 
point, 
the 
very 
errors 
into 
which 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
had 
wandered. 
Consequently, 
when 
one 
of 
the 
Union 
members 
declared 
at 
the 
"Unity" 
Congress 
that 
the 
articles 
in 
No. 
10 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
were 
prompted, 
not 
by 
a 
new 
"historical 
turn" 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
Union, 
but 
by 
the 
excessive 
"abstractness" 
of 
the 
resolutions,* 
this 
was 
quite 
justly 
ridiculed 
by 
one 
of 
the 
speakers. 
Far 
from 
being 
abstract, 
he 
said, 
the 
resolutions 
are 
incredibly 
concrete: 
a 
single 
glance 
at 
them 
is 
sufficient 
to 
see 
that 
they 
are 
out 
to 
"catch" 
someone. 
This 
remark 
was 
the 
occasion 
for 
a 
characteristic 
episode 
at 
the 
congress. 
On 
the 
one 
hand, 
B. 
Krichevsky 
seized 
upon 
the 
word 
"catch" 
in 
the 
belief 
that 
this 
was 
a 
slip 
of 
the 
tongue 
which 
betrayed 
our 
evil 
intentions 
("to 
set 
a 
trap") 
and 
pathetically 
exclaimed: 
"Whom 
are 
they 
out 
to 
catch, 


* 
This 
assertion 
is 
repeated 
in 
Two 
Congresses, 
p. 
25. 
whom?" 
"Whom 
indeed?" 
--Plekhanov 
rejoined 
sarcastically. 
"I 
will 
stimulate 
Comrade 
Plekhanov's 
perspicacity," 
replied 
B. 
Krichevsky. 
"I 
will 
explain 
to 
him 
that 
the 
trap 
was 
set 
for 
the 
editorial 
board 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo," 
(general 
laughter) 
"but 
we 
have 
not 
allowed 
ourselves 
to 
be 
caught!" 
(A 
remark 
from 
the 
left: 
"All 
the 
worse 
for 
you! 
") 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Borba 
group 
(a 
group 
of 
conciliators), 
in 
opposing 
the 
Union's 
amendments 
to 
the 
resolutions 
and 
wishing 
to 
defend 
our 
speaker, 
declared 
that 
obviously 
the 
word 
"catch" 
was 
dropped 
by 
chance 
in 
the 
heat 
of 
polemics. 


For 
my 
part, 
I 
think 
the 
speaker 
responsible 
for 
uttering 
the 
words 
under 
discussion 
will 
hardly 
be 
pleased 
with 
this 
"defence." 
I 
think 
the 
words 
"catch 
someone" 
were 
"true 
words 
spoken 
in 
jest": 
We 
have 
always 
accused 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
of 
instability 
and 
vacillation 
and, 
naturally, 
we 
had 
to 
try 
to 
catch 
it 
in 
order 
to 
put 
a 
stop 
to 
this 
vacillation. 
There 
is 
not 
the 
slightest 
suggestion 
of 
evil 
intent 
in 
this, 
for 
we 
were 
discussing 
instability 
of 



principles. 
And 
we 
succeeded 
in 
"catching" 
the 
Union 
in 
such 
a 
comradely 
manner* 
that 
B. 
Krichevsky 
himself 
and 
one 
other 


* 
Precisely: 
In 
the 
introduction 
to 
the 
June 
resolutions 
we 
said 
that 
Russian 
Social-Democracy 
as 
a 
whole 
always 
stood 
by 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
Emancipation 
of 
Labour 
group 
and 
that 
the 
Union's 
particular 
service 
was 
its 
publishing 
and 
organizing 
activity. 
In 
other 
words, 
we 
expressed 
our 
complete 
readiness 
to 
forget 
the 
past 
and 
to 
recognize 
the 
usefulness 
(for 
the 
cause) 
of 
the 
work 
of 
our 
comrades 
of 
the 
Union 
on 
the 
condition 
that 
it 
completely 
ceased 
the 
vacillation 
which 
we 
tried 
to 
"catch." 
Any 
impartial 
person 
reading 
the 
June 
resolutions 
will 
only 
interpret 
them 
in 
that 
way. 
If 
the 
Union, 
after 
having 
caused 
a 
split 
by 
its 
new 
turn 
towards 
Economism 
(in 
its 
articles 
in 
No. 
10 
and 
in 
the 
amendments), 
now 
solemnly 
accuses 
us 
of 
prevaricating 
(Two 
Congresses, 
p. 
30) 
because 
of 
what 
we 
said 
about 
its 
services, 
then 
of 
course, 
such 
an 
accusation 
can 
only 
evoke 
a 
smile. 
member 
of 
the 
Managing 
Committee 
of 
the 
Union 
signed 
the 
June 
resolutions. 


The 
articles 
in 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No. 
10 
(our 
comrades 
saw 
this 
issue 
for 
the 
first 
time 
when 
they 
arrived 
at 
the 
congress, 
a 
few 
days 
before 
the 
meetings 
started), 
clearly 
showed 
that 
a 
new 
turn 
had 
taken 
place 
in 
the 
Union 
in 
the 
period 
between 
the 
summer 
and 
the 
autumn: 
the 
Economists 
had 
again 
gained 
the 
upper 
hand, 
and 
the 
editorial 
board, 
which 
turned 
with 
every 
"wind," 
again 
set 
out 
to 
defend 
"the 
most 
pronounced 
Bernsteinians" 
and 
"freedom 
of 
criticism," 
to 
defend 
"spontaneity," 
and 
through 
the 
mouth 
of 
Martynov, 
to 
preach 
the 
"theory 
of 
restricting" 
the 
sphere 
of 
our 
political 
influence 
(for 
the 
alleged 
purpose 
of 
making 
this 
influence 
more 
complex). 
Once 
again 
Parvus' 
apt 
observation 
that 
it 
was 
difficult 
to 
catch 
an 
opportunist 
with 
a 
formula 
was 
proved 
correct. 
An 
opportunist 
will 
put 
his 
name 
to 
any 
formula 
and 
as 
readily 
abandon 
it, 
because 
opportunism 
is 
precisely 
a 
lack 
of 
definite 
and 
firm 
principles. 
Today, 
the 
opportunists 
have 
repudiated 
all 
attempts 
to 
introduce 
opportunism, 
repudiated 
all 
narrowness, 
solemnly 
promised 
"never 
for 
a 
moment 
to 
forget 
about 
the 
task 
of 
overthrowing 
the 
autocracy," 
to 
carry 
on 
"agitation 
not 
only 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
everyday 
struggle 
between 
wage 
labour 
and 
capital," 
etc., 
etc. 
But 
tomorrow 
they 
will 
change 
their 
form 
of 
expression 
and 
revert 
to 
their 
old 
tricks 
on 
the 
pretext 
of 
defending 
spontaneity 
and 
the 
forward 
march 
of 
the 
drab 
everyday 
struggle, 
of 
extolling 
demands 
promising 
palpable 
results, 
etc. 
By 
continuing 
to 
assert 
that 
in 
the 
articles 
in 
No. 
10 
"the 
Union 
did 
not 
and 



does 
not 
now 
see 
any 
heretical 
departure 
from 
the 
general 
principles 
of 
the 
draft 
adopted 
at 
the 
conference" 
(Two 
Congresses, 
p. 
26), 
the 
Union 
only 
reveals 
a 
complete 
lack 
of 
ability, 
or 
of 


desire, 
to 
understand 
the 
essential 
points 
of 
the 
disagreements. 


After 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No. 
10, 
we 
could 
make 
only 
one 
effort: 
open 
a 
general 
discussion 
in 
order 
to 
ascertain 
whether 
all 
the 
members 
of 
the 
Union 
agree 
with 
these 
articles 
and 
with 
its 
editorial 
board. 
The 
Union 
is 
particularly 
displeased 
with 
us 
because 
of 
this 
and 
accuses 
us 
of 
trying 
to 
sow 
discord 
in 
its 
ranks, 
of 
interfering 
in 
other 
people's 
business, 
etc. 
These 
accusations 
are 
obviously 
unfounded 
because 
with 
an 
elected 
editorial 
board 
which 
"turns" 
with 
every 
wind, 
however 
light, 
everything 
depends 
precisely 
upon 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
wind, 
and 
we 
defined 
that 
direction 
at 
private 
meetings 
at 
which 
no 
one, 
except 
members 
of 
the 
organizations 
intending 
to 
unite, 
were 
present. 
The 
amendments 
to 
the 
June 
resolutions 
submitted 
in 
the 
name 
of 
the 
Union 
have 
removed 
the 
last 
shadow 
of 
a 
hope 
of 
arriving 
at 
agreement. 
The 
amendments 
are 
documentary 
evidence 
of 
the 
new 
turn 
towards 
Economism 
and 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
Union 
members 
are 
in 
agreement 
with 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No. 
10. 
It 
was 
moved 
to 
delete 
the 
words 
"so-called 
Economism" 
from 
the 
reference 
to 
manifestations 
of 
opportunism 
(on 
the 
plea 
that 
"the 
meaning" 
of 
these 
three 
words 
"was 
vague" 
--but 
if 
that 
were 
so, 
all 
that 
was 
required 
was 
a 
more 
precise 
definition 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
widespread 
error), 
and 
to 
delete 
"Millerandism" 
(although 
B. 
Krichevsky 
defended 
it 
in 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo, 
No. 
2-3, 
pp. 
83-84, 
and 
still 
more 
openly 
in 
the 
Vorwärts).* 
Notwithstanding 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
June 
resolutions 
definitely 
indicated 
that 
the 
task 
of 
Social-

A 
controversy 
over 
this 
subject 
had 
started 
in 
the 
Vorwärts 
between 
its 
present 
editor, 
Kautsky, 
and 
the 
editorial 
board 
of 
the 
Zarya. 
We 
shall 
not 
fail 
to 
acquaint 
the 
Russian 
reader 
with 
this 
controversy.[106] 
mocracy 
is 
"to 
guide 
every 
manifestation 
of 
the 
proletarian 
struggle 
against 
all 
forms 
of 
political, 
economic 
and 
social 
oppression," 
thereby 
calling 
for 
the 
introduction 
of 
system 
and 
unity 
in 
all 
these 
manifestations 
of 
the 
struggle, 
the 
Union 
added 
the 
absolutely 
superfluous 
words 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
"the 
economic 
struggle 
is 
a 
powerful 
stimulus 
to 
the 
mass 
movement" 
(taken 
by 
itself, 
this 
assertion 
cannot 
be 
disputed, 
but 
with 
the 
existence 
of 
narrow 
Economism 
it 
could 
not 
but 
give 
occasion 
for 
false 
interpretations). 
More, 
even 
the 
direct 
narrowing 
down 
of 
"politics" 
was 
introduced 
into 
the 



June 
resolutions, 
both 
by 
the 
deletion 
of 
the 
words 
"not 
for 
a 
moment" 
(to 
forget 
the 
aim 
of 
overthrowing 
the 
autocracy), 
and 
by 
the 
addition 
of 
the 
words 
"the 
economic 
struggle 
is 
the 
most 
widely 
applicable 
means 
of 
drawing 
the 
masses 
into 
active 
political 
struggle." 
Naturally, 
after 
such 
amendments 
had 
been 
introduced 
all 
the 
speakers 
on 
our 
side, 
one 
after 
another, 
refused 
to 
take 
the 
floor, 
considering 
that 
it 
was 
useless 
to 
continue 
negotiations 
with 
people 
who 
were 
again 
turning 
towards 
Economism 
and 
who 
were 
striving 
to 
secure 
for 
themselves 
freedom 
of 
vacillation. 


"It 
was 
precisely 
the 
preservation 
of 
the 
independent 
features 
and 
the 
autonomy 
of 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
which 
the 
Union 
considered 
the 
sine 
gua 
non 
of 
the 
durability 
of 
our 
future 
agreement, 
that 
the 
Iskra 
regarded 
as 
the 
stumbling 
block 
to 
agreement." 
(Two 
Congresses, 
p. 
25.) 
This 
is 
very 
inexact. 
We 
never 
had 
any 
designs 
against 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo's 
autonomy.* 
We 
did 
indeed 
absolutely 
refuse 
to 
recognize 
the 
independence 
of 
its 
features, 
if 
by

That 
is, 
if 
the 
editorial 
consultations 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
joint 
supreme 
council 
of 
the 
combined 
organizations 
are 
not 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
restriction 
of 
autonomy. 
But 
in 
June 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
agreed 
to 
this. 
pendent 
features" 
is 
meant 
independence 
on 
questions 
of 
principle 
regarding 
theory 
and 
practice: 
The 
June 
resolutions 
did 
indeed 
absolutely 
repudiate 
such 
independence 
of 
features 
because, 
in 
practice, 
such 
"independent 
features" 
have 
always 
meant, 
as 
we 
have 
pointed 
out, 
all 
sorts 
of 
vacillations 
that 
foster 
the 
disunity 
which 
prevails 
among 
us 
and 
which 
is 
intolerable 
from 
the 
Party 
point 
of 
view. 
The 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo's 
articles 
in 
its 
issue 
No. 
10, 
and 
its 
"Amendments" 
clearly 
revealed 
its 
desire 
to 
preserve 
precisely 
this 
kind 
of 
independence 
of 
features, 
and 
such 
a 
desire 
naturally 
and 
inevitably 
led 
to 
a 
rupture 
and 
a 
declaration 
of 
war. 
But 
all 
of 
us 
were 
ready 
to 
recognize 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo's 
"independent 
features" 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
it 
should 
concentrate 
on 
definite 
literary 
functions. 
A 
proper 
distribution 
of 
these 
functions 
naturally 
called 
for: 
1) 
a 
scientific 
magazine, 
2) 
a 
political 
newspaper, 
and 
3) 
popular 
symposiums 
of 
articles, 
and 
popular 
pamphlets. 
Only 
by 
agreeing 
to 
such 
a 
distribution 
of 
functions 
would 
the 
Rabocheye 
Dyelo 
have 
proved 
that 
it 
sincerely 
desired 
to 
abandon 
once 
and 
for 
all 
its 
erring 
ways, 
against 
which 
the 
June 
resolutions 
were 
directed. 
Only 
such 
a 
distribution 
of 
functions 
would 
have 
removed 
all 
possibility 
of 
friction, 
and 
would 
have 
effectively 
guaranteed 
a 
durable 
agreement 
which, 
at 



the 
same 
time, 
would 
have 
served 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
a 
fresh 
revival 
and 
new 
successes 
of 
our 
movement. 


At 
present 
not 
a 
single 
Russian 
Social-Democrat 
can 
have 
any 
doubts 
that 
the 
final 
rupture 
between 
the 
revolutionary 
and 
opportunist 
tendencies 
was 
caused, 
not 
by 
any 
"organizational" 
circumstances, 
but 
by 
the 
desire 
of 
the 
opportunists 
to 
consolidate 
the 
independent 
features 
of 
opportunism 
and 
to 
continue 
to 
cause 
confusion 
of 
mind 
by 
the 
disquisitions 
of 
the 
Krichevskys 
and 
Martynovs. 


CORRECTION 
TO 
WHAT 
IS 
TO 
BE 
DONE? 


The 
Group 
of 
Initiators 
of 
whom 
I 
speak 
in 
the 
pamphlet 
What 
Is 
To 
Be 
Done?, 
p. 
141,[107] 
have 
asked 
me 
to 
make 
the 
following 
correction 
to 
my 
description 
of 
the 
part 
they 
played 
in 
the 
attempt 
to 
reconcile 
the 
Social-
Democratic 
organizations 
abroad: 
Of 
the 
three 
members 
of 
this 
group, 
only 
one 
left 
the 
Union 
at 
the 
end 
of 
1900; 
the 
others 
left 
in 
1901, 
only 
after 
they 
had 
become 
convinced 
that 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
obtain 
the 
Union's 
consent 
to 
a 
conference 
with 
the 
Iskra 
organization 
abroad 
and 
the 
Revolutionary 
Sotsial-Demokrat 
Organization, 
which 
is 
what 
the 
Group 
of 
Initiators 
had 
proposed. 
The 
Managing 
Committee 
of 
the 
Union 
first 
rejected 
this 
proposal, 
claiming 
that 
the 
persons 
making 
up 
the 
Group 
of 
Initiators 
were 
"not 
competent" 
to 
act 
as 
mediators 
and 
expressed 
the 
desire 
to 
enter 
into 
direct 
contact 
with 
the 
Iskra 
organization 
abroad. 
Soon 
after, 
however, 
the 
Managing 
Committee 
of 
the 
Union 
informed 
the 
Group 
of 
Initiators 
that 
after 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
first 
number 
of 
the 
Iskra 
containing 
the 
report 
of 
the 
split 
in 
the 
Union, 
it 
had 
altered 
its 
decision 
and 
no 
longer 
desired 
to 
have 
communication 
with 
the 
Iskra. 
After 
this, 
how 
can 
one 
explain 
the 
statement 
made 
by 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Managing 
Committee 
of 
the 
Union 
that 
the 
latter's 
rejection 
of 
a 
conference 
was 
called 
forth 
entirely 
by 
its 
dissatisfaction 
with 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
Group 
of 
Initiators? 
It 
is 
true 
that 
it 
is 
equally 
difficult 
to 
explain 
why 
the 
Managing 
Committee 
of 
the 
Union 
agreed 
to 
a 
conference 
in 
June 
last; 
for 
the 
article 
in 
the 
first 
issue 
of 
the 
Iskra 
still 
remained 
in 
force 
and 
the 
Iskra's 
"negative" 
attitude 
to 
the 
Union 
was 
still 
more 
strongly 
expressed 
in 
the 
first 
issue 
of 
the 
Zarya, 
and 
in 
No. 
4 
of 
the 
Iskra, 
both 
of 
which 
appeared 
prior 
to 
the 
June 
Conference.

What 
Is 
To 
Be 
Done? 
Burning 
Questions 
of 
Our 
Movement 
--a 
book 
written 
by 
Lenin 
in 
the 
latter 
part 
of 
1901 
and 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
1902. 
In 
"Where 
To 
Begin?", 
published 
in 
the 
Iskra, 
No. 
4 
(May 
1901), 
Lenin 
wrote 
that 
the 
article 
represents 
"the 
outlines 
of 
a 
plan 
which 
is 
described 
in 
greater 
detail 
in 
a 
pamphlet 
now 
in 
preparation 
for 
the 
press." 
Lenin 
began 
the 
actual 
writing 
of 
the 
book 
in 
the 
autumn 
of 
1901. 
In 
his 
"Preface 
to 
'Documents 
of 
the 
"Unity" 
Congress,'" 
written 
in 
November 
1901, 
Lenin 
stated 
that 
the 
book 
"was 
in 
preparation 
and 
would 
appear 
at 
an 
early 
date." 
Lenin 
subsequently 
described 
his 
article, 
"A 
Conversation 
with 
the 
Advocates 
of 
Economism" 
(Iskra, 
No. 
12, 
December 
1901) 
as 
a 
synopsis 
of 
What 
Is 
To 
Be 
Done? 
In 
February 
1902 
Lenin 
wrote 
the 
preface 
to 
the 
book, 
which 
appeared 
in 
the 
early 
days 
of 
March 
in 
Stuttgart 
where 
it 
was 
published 
by 
Dietz. 
An 
an 
nouncement 
of 
its 
publication 
was 
printed 
in 
the 
Iskra, 
No. 
18, 
March 
10, 
1902. 
The 
ideas 
Lenin 
advanced 
and 
expounded 
in 
What 
Is 
To 
Be 
Done? 
were 
upheld 
and 
developed 
by 
Comrade 
Stalin. 
His 
pamphlet 
Briefly 
About 
the 
Disagreements 
in 
the 
Party, 
written 
in 
the 
spring 
of 
1905, 
is 
intimately 
connected 
with 
What 
Is 
To 
Be 
Done? 
(J. 
V. 
Stalin, 
Works, 
Russ. 
ed., 
Vol. 
1, 
pp. 
89-130). 
The 
defence 
of 
Lenin's 
ideas, 
enunciated 
in 
What 
Is 
To 
Be 
Done?, 
is 
taken 
up 
by 
Comrade 
Stalin 
also 
in 
his 
article 
"A 
Reply 
to 
Sotsial-Demokrat," 
published 
in 
the 
newspaper 
Proletariatis 
Brdazola 
(The 
Struggle 
of 
the 
Proletariat 
) 
in 
August 
1905 
(J. 
V. 
Stalin, 
Works, 
Russ. 
ed., 
Vol. 
1, 
pp. 
160-72). 
Lenin 
gave 
a 
high 
appraisal 
of 
this 
article, 
noting, 
in 
particular, 
that 
it 
contained 
a 
"splendid 
presentation 
of 
the 
question 
of 
the 
celebrated 
'introduction 
of 
consciousness 
from 
without.'" 
In 
republishing 
What 
Is 
To 
Be 
Done? 
in 
1907 
in 
the 
collection 
Twelve 
Years, 
Lenin 
omitted 
section 
A 
of 
Chapter 
V 
"Who 
Was 
Offended 
by 
the 
Article 
' 
Where 
To 
Begin?'" 
and 
announced 
in 
the 
preface 
that 
the 
book 
was 
being 
published 
"with 
very 
slight 
abridgements, 
omitting 
only 
details 
concerning 
organizational 
relationships 
and 
minor 
polemical 
remarks." 
Lenin 
added 
five 
footnotes 
to 
the 
new 
edition.

Iskra 
(The 
Spark 
) 
--the 
first 
all-Russian 
illegal 
Marxist 
newspaper, 
founded 
by 
Lenin 
in 
1900. 
It 
played 
a 
decisive 
role 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
Marxist 
party, 
in 
the 
defeat 
of 
the 
"Economists," 
in 
the 
unification 
of 
the 
dispersed 
Social-Democratic 
groups 
and 
in 
preparation 
for 
the 
Second 
Congress 
of 
the 
R.S.D.L.P. 
The 
publication 
of 
a 
revolutionary 
newspaper 
in 
Russia 
was 
impossible 
owing 
to 
police 
persecution. 
While 
still 
in 
exile 
in 
Siberia, 
Lenin 
worked 
out 
all 
the 
details 
of 
a 
plan 
to 
publish 
the 
paper 
abroad 
and 
proceeded 
to 
carry 
out 
this 
plan 
as 
soon 
as 
his 
term 
of 
exile 
ended 
in 
January 
1900. 
The 
first 
issue 
of 
Lenin's 
Iskra 
appeared 
on 
December 
11 
(24), 
1900, 
in 
Leipzig, 
after 
which 
it 
was 
published 
in 
Munich, 
London 
(from 
April 
1902) 
and, 
beginning 
with 
the 
spring 
of 
1903, 
in 
Geneva. 
The 
editorial 
board 
of 
the 
Iskra 
was 
made 
up 
of 
V. 
I. 
Lenin, 
G. 
V. 
Plekhanov, 
Y. 
O. 
Martov, 
P. 
B. 
Axelrod, 
A. 
N.

and

of 
the 
editorial 
board 
in 
the 
spring 
of 
1900. 
Lenin 
was 
the 
Iskra's 
actual 
editor-in-chief 
and 
leader 
of 
its 
activities. 
His 
articles 
in 
the 
Iskra 
dealt 
with 
all 
the 
fundamental 
problems 
of 
building 
the 
Party 
and 
of 
the 
class 
struggle 
of 
the 
proletariat 
in 
Russia 
as 
well 
as 
with 
outstanding 
events 
on 
the 
international 
scene. 
Groups 
and 
committees 
of 
the 
R.S.D.L.P. 
supporting 
the 
Lenin-Iskra 
line 
were 
organized 
in 
many 
cities 
of 
Russia, 
including 
St. 
Petersburg 
and 
Moscow. 
Iskra 
organizations 
were 
founded 
by 
and 
worked 
under 
the 
direct 
guidance 
of 
professional 
revolutionaries 
trained 
by 
Lenin 
(N. 
E. 
Bauman, 
I. 
V. 
Babushkin, 
S. 
I. 
Gusev, 
M. 
I. 
Kalinin 
and 
others). 
On 
Lenin's 
initiative, 
and 
with 
his 
immediate 
participation, 
the 
Iskra 
editorial 
board 
drew 
up 
a 
draft 
program 
of 
the 
Party 
(published 
in 
issue 
No. 
21), 
and 
prepared 
the 
Second 
Congress 
of 
the 
R.S.D.L.P., 
which 
was 
held 
in 
July-August 
1903. 
By 
that 
time 
most 
of 
the 
Social-Democratic 
organizations 
in 
Russia 
had 
associated 
themselves 
with 
the 
Iskra, 
approved 
its 
tactics, 
program 
and 
organizational 
plan, 
and 
recognized 
it 
as 
their 
leading 
organ. 
In 
a 
special 
resolution 
the 
Second 
Congress 
recorded 
the 
exceptional 
role 
of 
the 
paper 
in 
the 
struggle 
to 
create 
the 
Party 
and 
adopted 
the 
Iskra 
as 
the 
Central 
Organ 
of 
the 
R.S.D.L.P. 
The 
Second 
Congress 
appointed 
an 
editorial 
board 
consisting 
of 
Lenin, 
Plekhanov 
and 
Martov. 
Contrary 
to 
the 
Congress 
decision, 
Martov 
refused 
to 
serve 
on 
the 
board, 
and 
issues 
46-51 
of 
the 
Iskra 
were 
edited 
by 
Lenin 
and 
Plekhanov. 
Subsequently, 
Plekhanov 
took 
his 
stand 
with 
the 
Mensheviks 
and 
demanded 
that 
all 
the 
former 
Menshevik 



editors, 
who 
had 
been 
rejected 
by 
the 
Congress, 
be 
included 
in 
the 
editorial 
board. 
Lenin 
could 
not 
agree 
to 
this, 
and 
on 
October 
19 
(November 
1), 
1903, 
resigned 
from 
the 
editorial 
board 
in 
order 
to 
involve 
himself 
in 
the 
Central 
Committee 
of 
the 
Party 
and 
to 
strike 
at 
the 
Menshevik 
opportunists 
from 
this 
position. 
Issue 
52 
of 
the 
Iskra 
was 
edited 
by 
Plekhanov 
alone. 
On 
November 
13 
(26), 
1903, 
acting 
on 
his 
own 
and 
in 
defiance 
of 
the 
will 
of 
the 
Congress, 
Plekhanov 
co-opted 
the 
former 
Menshevik 
editors 
to 
the 
editorial 
board. 
Beginning 
with 
the 
52nd 
issue 
of 
the 
Iskra, 
the 
Mensheviks 
converted 
it 
into 
their 
organ. 
From 
that 
time 
Lenin's 
Bolshevik 
Iskra, 
known 
in 
the 
Party 
as 
the 
old 
Iskra, 
was 
replaced 
by 
the 
Menshevik 
opportunist 
Iskra 
as 
the 
new 
Iskra.

Lassalleans 
and 
Eisenachers 
--two 
parties 
in 
the 
German 
working 
class 
movement 
in 
the 
sixties 
and 
early 
seventies 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century. 
Lassalleans 
--adherents 
and 
followers 
of 
Ferdinand 
Lassalle. 
The 
General 
German 
Labour 
League, 
founded 
by 
Lassalle 
in 
1863, 
made 
up 
the 
core 
of 
the 
movement. 
Proceeding 
from 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
peaceful 
transformation 
of 
capitalism 
into 
Socialism 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
workers' 
associations 
supported 
by 
the 
capitalist 
state, 
the 
Lassalleans 
advocated 
the 


struggle 
for 
universal 
franchise 
and 
peaceful 
parliamentary 
activities 
as 
a 
substitute 
for 
the 
revolutionary 
struggle 
of 
the 
working 
class. 
Marx 
trenchantly 
criticized 
the 
Lassalleans, 
pointing 
out 
that 
"over 
a 
course 
of 



several 
years 
they 
were 
a 
hindrance 
to 
the 
organization 
of 
the 
proletariat 
and 
ended 
up 
by 
becoming 
no 
more 
than 
a 
tool 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
police." 
Marx 
gives 
an 
appraisal 
of 
the 
theoretical 
views 
of 
the 
Lassalleans 
and 
of 
their 
tactics 
in 
Critique 
of 
the 
Gotha 
Program, 
Alleged 
Splits 
in 
the 
International 
and 
in 
correspondence 
with 
Engels. 


Eisenachers 
--supporters 
of 
Marxism, 
ideologically 
influenced 
by 
Marx 
and 
Engels. 
Led 
by 
Wilhelm 
Liebknecht 
and 
August 
Bebel, 
they 
founded 
the 
Social-Democratic 
Labour 
Party 
of 
Germany 
at 
the 
Eisenach 
Congress 
in 
I869. 
The 
two 
parties, 
which 
fought 
each 
other 
bitterly, 
were 
impelled 
to 
merge 
by 
the 
rise 
of 
the 
workers' 
movement 
and 
intensified 
reprisals 
by 
the 
government. 
The 
merger 
was 
effected 
at 
the 
Gotha 
Congress 
in 
1875, 
when 
a 
single 
Socialist 
Labour 
Party 
of 
Germany 
was 
formed, 
in 
which 
the 
Lassalleans 
represented 
the 
opportunist 
wing. 
Lenin 
describes 
the 
Lassalleans 
and 
Eisenachers 
in 
his 
article 
"August 
Bebel," 
written 
in 
August 
1913.

Guesdites 
and 
Possibilists 
--two 
trends 
in 
the 
French 
Socialist 
movement; 
they 
originated 
in 
1882 
following 
the 
split 
in 
the 
French 
Labour 
Party. 
Guesdites 
--supporters 
of 
Jules 
Guesde. 
They 
represented 
the 
Left, 
Marxist 
trend 
and 
maintained 
that 
the 
proletariat 
must 
pursue 
an 
independent 
revolutionary 
policy. 
In 
1901 
the 
Guesdites 
founded 
the 
Socialist 
Party 
of 
France. 


Possibilists 
--a 
petty-bourgeois, 
reformist 
trend 
which 
sought 
to 
deflect 
the 
proletariat 
from 
revolutionary 
methods 
of 
struggle. 
They 
proposed 
to 
confine 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
working 
class 
to 
what 
was 
"possible" 
under 
capitalism. 
In 
1902, 
in 
conjunction 
with 
other 
reformist 
groups, 
they 
founded 
the 
French 
Socialist 
Party. 


The 
Socialist 
Party 
of 
France 
and 
the 
French 
Socialist 
Party 
merged 
in 
1905. 
During 
the 
imperialist 
war 
of 
1914-18 
Jules 
Guesde, 
in 
common 
with 
the 
leadership 
of 
the 
French 
Socialist 
Party, 
took 
his 
stand 
as 
a 
social-
chauvinist. 
[p.7] 


[9] 
Fabians 
--members 
of 
the 
reformist 
and 
opportunist 
Fabian 
Society, 
formed 
by 
a 
group 
of 
British 
bourgeois 
intellectuals 
in 
1884. 
The 
society 
took 
its 
name 
from 
the 
Roman 
General 
Fabius 
Cunctator 
(the 
"Delayer"), 
famous 
for 
his 
procrastinating 
tactics 
and 
avoidance 
of 
decisive 
battles. 
The 
Fabian 
Society 
represented, 
as 
Lenin 
put 
it, 
"the 
most 
finished 
expression 
of 
opportunism 
and 
liberal-labour 
politics." 
The 
Fabians 
sought 

to 
deflect 
the 
proletariat 
from 
the 
class 
struggle 
and 
advocated 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
peaceful, 
gradual 
transition 
from 
capitalism 
to 
socialism 
by 
means 
of 
reforms. 
During 
the 
imperialist 
world 
war 
(1914-18) 
the 
Fabians 
took 
a 
social-chauvinist 
stand. 
For

the 
Fabians

Narodnaya 
Volya-ites 
--from 
Narodnaya 
Volya 
(People's 
Freedom), 
a 
secret 
society 
founded 
in 
1879 
for 
revolutionary 
struggle 
against 
the 
tsarist 
autocracy. 
The 
Narodnaya 
Volya 
was 
smashed 
by 
the 
tsarist 
government 
soon 
after 
its 
members 
had 
assassinated 
Alexander 
II 
on 
March 
1 
(13), 
1881. 
Following 
this 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
Narodniks 
abandoned 
the 
revolutionary 
struggle 
against 
tsardom, 
began 
to 
advocate 
reconciliation 
and 
agreement 
with 
the 
tsarist 
autocracy. 
These 
Epigoni 
of 
Narodism, 
the 
liberal 
Narodniks 
of 
the 
eighties 
and 
nineties 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
actually 
voiced 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
kulaks.

According 
to 
the 
Roman 
mythology, 
Jupiter 
was 
the 
chief 
of 
the 
gods, 
while 
Minerva 
was 
guardian 
goddess 
of 
handicrafts, 
science 
and 
art, 
of 
teachers 
and 
doctors. 
Minerva 
was 
said 
to 
have 
sprung 
in 
helmet 
and 
armour, 
sword 
in 
hand, 
from 
Jupiter's 
head. 
Her 
mode 
of 
birth

Cadets 
(Constitutional-Democratic 
Party) 
--the 
principal 
bourgeois 
party 
in 
Russia, 
the 
party 
of 
the 
liberal-monarchist 
bourgeoisie. 
It 
was 
founded 
in 
October 
1905. 
Feigning 
democracy 
and 
calling 
themselves 
the 
party 
of 
"people's 
freedom," 
the 
Cadets 
tried 
to 
win 
the 
peasantry 
to 
their 
side. 
They 
strove 
to 
preserve 
tsarism 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
constitutional 
monarchy. 
Subsequently, 
the 
Cadets 
became 
the 
party 
of 
the 
imperialist 
bourgeoisie. 
After 
the 
victory 
of 
the 
October 
Socialist 
Revolution, 
the 
Cadets 
organized 
counter-revolutionary 
conspiracies 
and 
revolts 
against 
the 
Soviet 
Republic.

textbooks 
on 
history 
widely 
used 
in 
elementary

Russia 
prior 
to 
the 
revolution. 
Ilovaisky 
interpreted 
history 
as 
consisting 
mainly 
of 
the 
acts 
of 
tsars 
and 
generals, 
and 
explained

The 
Anti-Socialist 
Law 
was 
introduced 
in 
Germany 
in 
1878. 
It 
provided 
for 
the 
prohibition 
of 
all 
Social-Democratic 
organizations, 
mass 
labour 
organizations, 
the 
labour 
press, 
the 
confiscation 
of 
socialist 
literature 
and 
the 
persecution 
of 
Social-Democrats. 
The 
law 
was 
repealed 
in 
1890 
under 
pressure 
by 
the 
mass 
working-class 
movement.

Vorwärts 
(Forward 
) 
--a 
daily 
newspaper, 
central 
organ 
of 
the 
German 
Social-Democratic 
Party. 
It 
began 
publication 
in 
1876, 
with 
Wilhelm 
Liebknecht 
as 
editor. 
In 
its 
columns 
Frederick 
Engels 
combated 
all 
manifestations 
of 
opportunism. 
In 
the 
latter 
half 
of 
the 
nineties, 
after 
Engels' 
death, 
Vorwärts 
began 
systematically 
printing 
articles 
by 
opportunists 
who 
dominated 
the 
German 
Social-Democratic 
Party 
and 
the 
Second 
International. 
During 
the 
First 
World 
War 
Vorwärts 
took 
the 
stand 
of 
social-
chauvinism. 
It 
appeared 
in 
Berlin 
until 
1933.

The 
Katheder-Socialists 
(Socialists 
of 
the 
Chair) 
--a 
trend 
in 
bourgeois 
political 
economy, 
originated 
in 
Germany 
in 
the 
seventies 
and 
eighties 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century. 
The 
Katheder-Socialists 
used 
their 
position 
as 
university 
lecturers 
to 
preach 
bourgeois-liberal 
reformism 
under 
the 
guise 
of 
Socialism. 
Their 
contention 
was 
that 
the 
bourgeois 
state 
stood 
above 
classes, 
was 
capable 
of 
reconciling 
hostile 
classes, 
gradually 
introducing 
"Socialism" 
without 
encroaching 
on 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
capitalists 
and, 
as 
far 
as 
possible, 
of 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
workers. 
The 
views 
of 
the 
Katheder-Socialists 
were 
advocated 
in 
Russia 
by 
the 
"legal 
Marxists."

Nozdryov 
--a

Gogol 
called 
Nozdryov 
a 
"historical" 
personage 
because 
wherever 
he 
appeared 
he 
left 
behind 
a 
"history" 
of 
troublemaking.

The 
Hanover 
resolution 
regarding 
"attacks 
on 
the 
basic 
views 
and 
tactics 
of

party," 
adopted 
by 
the 
Congress

the 
German 
Social-
Democratic 
Party 
in 
Hanover, 
September 
27 
to 
October 
2 
(October 
9-14), 
1899. 
The 
discussion 
of 
this 
question 
at 
the 
congress 
and 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
special 
resolution 
were 
necessitated 
by 
the 
opportunists, 
led 
by 
Bernstein, 
advocating 
the 
revision 
of 
Marxist 
theory 
and 
demanding 
a 
review 
of 
Social-
Democratic 
revolutionary 
policy 
and 
tactics. 
The 
Hanover 
resolution 
rejected 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
revisionists 
but 
failed 
to 
criticize 
or 
expose 
Bernsteinism. 
Bernstein's 
supporters 
voted 
for 
the 
resolution.

Party 
in 
Lübeck, 
September 
9-15 
(22-28), 
1901. 
The 
central 
issue 
at 
the 
Congress 
was 
the 
struggle 
against 
revisionism, 
which 
by 
that 
time 
had 
taken 
shape 
as 
the 
Right 
wing 
of 
the 
Party 
with 
its 
own 
program 
and 
press 
organ, 
the 
Sozialistische 
Monatshefte 
(Socialist 
Monthly). 
The 
leader 
of 
the 
revisionists, 
Bernstein. 
who 
had 
been 
advocating 
a 
revision 
of 
scientific 
Socialism 
long 
before 
the 
Congress, 
demanded 
in 
his 
Congress 
speech 
"freedom 
to 
criticize" 
Marxism. 
The 
Congress 
rejected 
the 
resolution 
by 
Bernstein's 
supporters 
and 
adopted 
one 
which, 
though 
directly 
warning 
Bernstein, 
did 
not 
lay 
down 
the 
principle 
that 
Bernsteinian 
views 
were 
incompatible 
with 
membership 
in 
the 
working-class 
party.

The 
Stuttgart 
Congress 
of 
the 
German 
Social-Democratic 
Party, 
held 
on 
September 
21-26 
(October 
3-8), 
1898, 
was 
the 
first 
congress 
to 
discuss 
the 
question 
of 
revisionism 
in 
the 
German 
Social-Democratic 
movement. 
It 
heard 
a 
statement 
in 
absentia 
from 
Bernstein, 
in 
which 
he 
set 
forth 
and 
defended 
his 
opportunist 
views, 
expounded 
earlier 
in 
a 
number 
of 
articles. 
Bernstein's 
opponents 
at 
the 
congress 
failed 
to 
take 
a 
united 
stand. 
One 
section 
(Bebel 
and 
others) 
advocated 
ideological 
struggle 
against 
Bernstein 
and 
criticism 
of 
his 
mistakes, 
but 
did 
not 
agree 
to 
take 
organizational 
measures 
against 
him. 
Another 
section, 
the 
minority 
headed 
by 
Rosa 
Luxemburg, 
was 
more 
resolute 
in 
its 
opposition 
to 
Bernsteinism.

The 
"Protest 
of 
the 
Russian 
Social-Democrats" 
was 
written 
by 
Lenin 
in 
1899, 
during 
his 
exile. 
It 
was 
directed 
against 
the 
Credo 
of 
a 
group 
of 
"Economists" 
(S. 
N. 
Prokopovich, 
E. 
D. 
Kuskova 
and 
others 
who 
subsequently 
became 
Cadets). 
On 
receiving 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
Credo 
through 
his 
sister, 
A. 
I. 
Yelizarova, 
Lenin 
wrote 
a 
sharp 
protest 
in 
which 
he 
exposed 
the 
nature 
of 
this 
declaration. 
The 
Protest 
was 
discussed 
and 
unanimously 
endorsed 
by 
a 
meeting 
of 
seventeen 
exiled 
Marxists, 
convened 
by 
Lenin 
in 
the 
village 
of 
Yermakovskoye, 
Minusinsk 
District. 
The 
exiles 
in 
the 
Turukhansk 
District 
and 
in 
Orlovo 
(Vyatka 
Gubernia) 
subsequently 
associated 
themselves 
with 
it. 
Lenin 
forwarded 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
Protest 
to 
the 
Emancipation

it 
was

Emancipation

--the 
first 
Russian 
Marxist 
group, 
organized 
by 
G. 
V. 
Plekhanov 
in 
Geneva 
in 
1883. 
At 
the 
Second 
Congress 
of 
the 
R.S.D.L.P. 
in 
August 
1903, 
the 
group 
announced 
its 
dissolution. 
The 
group 
did 
much 
to 
spread 
Marxism 
in 
Russia. 
It 
translated 
such 
Marxist 
works 
as 
Manifesto 
of 
the 
Communist 
Party 
by 
Marx 
and 
Engels, 
Wage-

by 
Engels, 
publishing 
them 
abroad 
and 
illegally 
spreading 
them 
in 
Russia. 
Plekhanov 
and 
his 
group 
dealt 
a 
serious 
blow 
at 
Narodism. 
The 
group, 
however, 
made 
some

The

of 
the 
Working

formed 
by

in 
the 
autumn 
of 
1895 
and 
united 

all 
the 
Marxist 
workers' 
circles 
in 
St. 
Petersburg. 
It 
was 
headed 
by 
a 
Central 
Group 
that 
was 
directed 
by 
Lenin. 
The 
League 
of 
Struggle 
was 
the 
first 
organization 
in 
Russia 
to 
combine 
Socialism 
with 
the 
working-class 
movement 
and 
to 
pass 
over 
from 
the 
propaganda 
of 
Marxism 
among 
a 
small 
circle

workers 
to 
political 
agitation

the 
broad

of 
the

Bund 
--the 
General 
Jewish 
Workers' 
Union 
of 
Lithuania, 
Poland 
and 
Russia. 
Founded 
in 
1897, 
it 
embraced 
mainly 
the 
Jewish 
artisans 
in 
the 
western 
regions 
of 
Russia. 
The 
Bund 
joined 
the 
R.S.D.L.P. 
at 
the 
latter's 
First 
Congress 
in 
March 
1898. 
At 
the 
Second 
R.S.D.L.P. 
Congress 
the 
Bund 
delegates 
insisted 
on 
their 
organization 
being 
recognized 
as 
the 
sole 
representative 
of 
the 
Jewish 
proletariat 
in 
Russia. 
The 
Congress 
rejected 
this 
organizational 
nationalism, 
whereupon 
the 
Bund 
withdrew 
from 
the 
Party. 
In 
1906, 
following 
the 
Fourth 
("Unity") 
Congress, 
the 
Bund 
reaffiliated 
to 
the 
R.S.D.L.P. 
The 
Bundists 
constantly 
supported 
the 
Mensheviks 
and 
waged 
an 
incessant 
struggle 
against 
the 
Bolsheviks. 
Despite 
its 
formal 
affiliation 
to 
the 
R.S.D.L.P., 
the 
Bund 
was 
an 
organization 
of 
a 
bourgeois-nationalist 
character. 
As 
opposed 
to 
the 
Bolshevik 
programmatic 
demand 
for 
the 
right 
of 
nations 
to 
self-determination, 
the 
Bund 
put 
for 
ward 
the 
demand 
for 
cultural-
national 
autonomy. 
During 
the 
First 
World 
War 
of 
l914-18 
the 
Bundists 
took 
the 
stand 
of 
social-chauvinism. 
In 
1917 
the 
Bund 
supported 
the 
counterrevolutionary 
Provisional 
Government 
and 
fought 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
enemies 
of 
the 
October 
Socialist 
Revolution. 
During 
the 
Civil 
War 
prominent 
Bundists 
joined 
forces 
with 
the 
counterrevolution. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
a 
turn 
began 
among 
the 
rank-and-file 
members 
of 
the 
Bund 
in 
favour 
of 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Soviet 
government. 
Only 
when 
the 
victory 
of 
the 
proletarian 
dictatorship 
over 
the 
internal 
counterrevolution 
and 
foreign 
interventionists 
became 
evident 
did 
the 
Bund 
declare 
its 
abandonment 
of 
the 
struggle 
against 
the 
Soviet 
system. 
In 
March 
1921, 
the 
Bund 
went 
into 
voluntary 
liquidation 
and 
part 
of 
its 
membership 
joined 
the 
R.C.P.(B.) 
in 
the 
ordinary 
way.

Iskra, 
No. 
7 
(August 
1901), 
carried 
in 
its 
section 
"The 
Workers' 
Movement 
and 
Letters 
from 
the 
Mills 
and 
Factories," 
a 
letter 
from 
a 
weaver 
which 
testified 
to 
the 
vast 
influence 
Lenin's 
Iskra 
exercised 
on 
the 
advanced 
workers. 
The 
letter 
reads 
in 
part: 
". 
. 
. 
I 
showed 
the 
Iskra 
to 
many 
fellow 
workers 
and 
the 
copy 
has 
been 
read 
to 
tatters; 
but 
we 
treasure 
it 
greatly. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
Iskra 
writes 
about 
our 
own 
cause, 
about 
the 
cause 
of 
all 
Russia 
which 
cannot 
be 
evaluated 
in 
kopeks 
or 
measured 
in 
hours 
of 
work; 
when 
you 
read 
the 
paper 
you 
understand 
why 
the 
gendarmes 
and 
police 
are 
afraid 
of 
us 
workers 
and 
of 
those 
intellectuals 
whom 
we 
follow. 
There 
is 
no 
denying 
that 
they 
do 
not 
simply 
make 
the 
bosses 
tremble 
for 
their 
pocketbooks, 
but 
inspire 
fear 
in 
the 
tsar, 
the 
employers 
and 
the 
rest. 
. 
. 
. 
It 
will 
not 
take 
much 
now 
to 
set 
the 
working 
folk 
aflame. 
All 
that 
is 
wanted 
is 
a 
spark 
to 
kindle 
the 
fire 
that 
is 
already 
smouldering 
among 
the 
people. 
How 
true 
are 
the 
words 
'the 
spark 
will 
kindle 
a 
flame!'. 
. 
. 
. 
In 
the 
past 
every 
strike 
was 
an 
event, 
but 
today 
everyone 
sees 
that 
strikes 
alone 
are 
not 
enough, 
that 
we 
must 
now 
strive 
for 
liberty, 
win 
it 
by 
might 
and 
main. 
Today 
everyone, 
old 
and 
young, 
is 
eager 
to 
read, 
but 
the 
sad 
thing 
is 
that 
there 
are 
no 
books. 
Last 
Sunday 
I 
gathered 
eleven 
people 
and 
read 
them 
'Where 
To 
Begin?', 
and 
we 
discussed 
it 
till 
late 
in 
the 
evening. 
How 
true 
it 
expresses 
everything, 
how 
it 
gets 
to 
the 
very 
heart 
of 
things. 
. 
. 
. 
And 
we 
would 
like 
to 
write 
a 
letter 
to 
your 
Iskra, 
to 
ask 
you 
to 
teach 
us 
not 
only 
how 
to 
begin, 
but 
how 
to 
live 
and 
how 
to 
die."

L. 
Brentano 
--a 
German 
bourgeois

who 
tried

prove 
the 
possibility 
of 
attaining 
social 
equality 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
capitalism 
by 
introducing 
reforms 
and 
conciliating 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
capitalists 
and 
workers. 
Using 
Marxist 
phraseology 
as 
a 
cover, 
Brentano 
and 
his 
followers 
endeavoured 
to 
subordinate 
the 
working-class 
movement 
to 
the 
interests 
of

of 
the 
"Economists." 
Formed

the 
spring 
of 
1899, 
it 
issued 
a 
mimeographed 
leaflet 
entitled

however, 
was 
not 
circulated

he 
rejected 
the 
love

all

punish 
him, 
Aphrodite,

Imperialism: 
The 
Final 
Stage 
of 
Capitalism 



Chapter 
I 


Concentration 
Of 
Production 
And 
Monopolies 


The 
enormous 
growth 
of 
industry 
and 
the 
remarkably 
rapid 
process 
of 
concentration 
of 
production 
in 
ever-larger 
enterprises 
represent 
one 
of 
the 
most 
characteristic 
features 
of 
capitalism. 
Modern 
censuses 
of 
production 
give 
complete 
and 
exact 
information 
on 
this 
process. 


In 
Germany, 
for 
example, 
for 
every 
1,000 
industrial 
enterprises, 
large 
enterprises, 
i.e., 
those 
employing 
more 
than 
50 
workers, 
numbered 
three 
in 
1882; 
six 
in 
1895; 
nine 
in 
1907; 
and 
out 
of 
every 
100 
workers 
employed, 
this 
group 
of 
enterprises, 
on 
the 
dates 
mentioned, 
employed 
22, 
30 
and 
37 
respectively. 
Concentration 
of 
production, 
however, 
is 
much 
more 
intense 
than 
the 
concentration 
of 
workers, 
since 
labor 
in 
the 
large 
enterprises 
is 
much 
more 
productive. 
This 
is 
shown 
by 
the 
figures 
available 
on 
steam 
and 
electric 
motors. 
If 
we 
take 
what 
in 
Germany 
is 
called 
industry 
in 
the 
broad 
sense 
of 
the 
term, 
that 
is, 
including 
commerce, 
transport, 
etc., 
we 
get 
the 
following 
picture: 
Large-scale 
enterprises: 
30,588 
out 
of 
a 
total 
of 
3,265,623, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
0.9 
per 
cent. 
These 
large-scale 
enterprises 
employ 
5,700,000 
workers 
out 
of 
a 
total 
of 
14,400,000, 
that 
is, 
39.4 
per 
cent; 
they 
use 
6,600,000 
steam 
horse 
power 
out 
of 
a 
total 
of 
8,800,000, 
that 
is, 
75.3 
per 
cent, 
and 
1,200,000 
kilowatts 
of 
electricity 
out 
of 
a 
total 
of 
1,500,000, 
that 
is, 
77.2 
per 
cent. 


Less 
than 
one-hundredth 
of 
the 
total 
enterprises 
utilize 
more 
than 
three-
fourths 
of 
the 
steam 
and 
electric 
power! 
Two 
million 
nine 
hundred 
and 
seventy 
thousand 
small 
enterprises 
(employing 
up 
to 
five 
workers), 
representing 
91 
per 
cent 
of 
the 
total, 
utilize 
only 
7 
per 
cent 
of 
the 
steam 
and 
electric 
power. 
Tens 
of 
thousands 
of 
large-scale 
enterprises 
are 
everything; 
millions 
of 
small 
ones 
are 
nothing. 


In 
1907, 
there 
were 
in 
Germany 
586 
establishments 
employing 
one 
thousand 
and 
more 
workers. 
They 
employed 
nearly 
one-tenth 
(1,380,000) 
of 
the 
total 
number 
of 
workers 
employed 
in 
industry 
and 
utilized 
almost 
one-
third 
(32 
per 
cent) 
of 
the 
total 
steam 
and 
electric 
power 
employed. 
As 
we 
shall 
see, 
money 
capital 
and 
the 
banks 
made 
this 
superiority 
of 
a 
handful 
of 
the 
largest 
enterprises 
still 
more 
overwhelming, 
in 
the 
most 
literal 
sense 
of 
the 
word, 
since 
millions 
of 
small, 
medium, 
and 
even 
some 
big 
“masters” 
are 
in 
fact 
in 
complete 
subjection 
to 
some 
hundreds 
of 
millionaire 
financiers. 



In 
another 
advanced 
country 
of 
modern 
capitalism, 
the 
United 
States, 
the 
growth 
of 
the 
concentration 
of 
production 
is 
still 
greater. 
Here 
statistics 
single 
out 
industry 
in 
the 
narrow 
sense 
of 
the 
word, 
and 
group 
enterprises 
according 
to 
the 
value 
of 
their 
annual 
output. 
In 
1904 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
large-scale 
enterprises 
with 
an 
annual 
output 
of 
one 
million 
dollars 
and 
over 
numbered 
1,900 
(out 
of 
216,180, 
that 
is, 
0.9 
per 
cent). 
These 
employed 
1,400,000 
workers 
(out 
of 
5,500,000, 
i.e., 
25.6 
per 
cent) 
and 
their 
combined 
annual 
output 
was 
valued 
at 
$5,600,000,000 
(out 
of 
$14,800,000,000, 
i.e., 
38 
per 
cent). 
Five 
years 
later, 
in 
1909, 
the 
corresponding 
figures 
were: 
Large-scale 
enterprises: 
3,060 
(out 
of 
268,491, 
i.e., 
1.1 
per 
cent); 
employing: 
2,000,000 
workers 
(out 
of 
6,600,000, 
i.e., 
30.5 
per 
cent); 
producing: 
$9,000,000,000 
(out 
of 
$20,700,000,000, 
i.e., 
43.8 
per 
cent). 


Almost 
half 
the 
total 
production 
of 
all 
the 
enterprises 
of 
the 
country 
was 
carried 
on 
by 
a 
hundredth 
part 
of 
those 
enterprises! 
These 
3,000 
giant 
enterprises 
embrace 
268 
branches 
of 
industry. 
From 
this 
it 
can 
be 
seen 
that, 
at 
a 
certain 
stage 
of 
its 
development, 
concentration 
itself, 
as 
it 
were, 
leads 
right 
to 
monopoly; 
for 
a 
score 
or 
so 
of 
giant 
enterprises 
can 
easily 
arrive 
at 
an 
agreement, 
while 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
the 
difficulty 
of 
competition 
and 
the 
tendency 
towards 
monopoly 
arise 
from 
the 
very 
dimensions 
of 
the 
enterprises. 
This 
transformation 
of 
competition 
into 
monopoly 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important—if 
not 
the 
most 
important—phenomena 
of 
modern 
capitalist 
economy, 
and 
we 
must 
deal 
with 
it 
in 
greater 
detail. 
But 
first 
we 
must 
clear 
up 
one 
possible 
misunderstanding. 


American 
statistics 
say: 
3,000 
giant 
enterprises 
in 
250 
branches 
of 
industry, 
as 
if 
there 
were 
only 
a 
dozen 
large-scale 
enterprises 
for 
each 
branch 
of 
industry. 


But 
this 
is 
not 
the 
case. 
Not 
in 
every 
branch 
of 
industry 
are 
there 
large-
scale 
enterprises; 
and, 
moreover, 
a 
very 
important 
feature 
of 
capitalism 
in 
its 
highest 
stage 
of 
development 
is 
the 
so-called 
combine, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
grouping 
in 
a 
single 
enterprise 
of 
different 
branches 
of 
industry, 
which 
either 
represent 
the 
consecutive 
stages 
in 
the 
working 
up 
of 
raw 
materials 
(for 
example, 
the 
smelting 
of 
iron 
ore 
into 
pig 
iron, 
the 
conversion 
of 
pig 
iron 
into 
steel, 
and 
then, 
perhaps, 
the 
manufacture 
of 
steel 
goods)—or 
are 
auxiliary 
to 
one 
another 
(for 
example, 
the 
utilization 
of 
waste 
or 
of 
by-products, 
the 
manufacture 
of 
packing 
materials, 
etc.). 


“... 
Combination,” 
writes 
Hilferding, 
“levels 
out 
the 
fluctuations 
of 
trade 
and 
therefore 
assures 
to 
the 
combined 
enterprises 
a 
more 
stable 
rate 
of 
profit. 



Secondly, 
combination 
has 
the 
effect 
of 
eliminating 
trading. 
Thirdly, 
it 
has 
the 
effect 
of 
rendering 
possible 
technical 
improvements 
and, 
consequently, 
the 
acquisition 
of 
super-profits 
over 
and 
above 
those 
obtained 
by 
the 
‘pure,’ 
i.e., 
non-combined, 
enterprises. 
Fourthly, 
it 
strengthens 
the 
position 
of 
the 
combined 
enterprises 
compared 
with 
that 
of 
‘pure’ 
enterprises, 
it 
increases 
their 
competitive 
power 
in 
periods 
of 
serious 
depression 
when 
the 
fall 
in 
prices 
of 
raw 
materials 
does 
not 
keep 
pace 
with 
the 
fall 
in 
prices 
of 
manufactured 
articles.” 


The 
German 
bourgeois 
economist, 
Heymann, 
who 
has 
written 
a 
book 
especially 
on 
“mixed,” 
that 
is, 
combined, 
enterprises 
in 
the 
German 
iron 
industry, 
says: 
“Non-combine 
enterprises 
perish, 
crushed 
by 
the 
high 
price 
of 
raw 
material 
and 
the 
low 
price 
of 
the 
finished 
product.” 
Thus 
we 
get 
the 
following 
picture: 


“There 
remain, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
the 
great 
coal 
companies, 
producing 
millions 
of 
tons 
yearly, 
strongly 
organized 
in 
their 
coal 
syndicate, 
and 
closely 
connected 
with 
them 
the 
big 
steel 
plants 
and 
their 
steel 
syndicate; 
and 
these 
great 
enterprises, 
producing 
400,000 
tons 
of 
steel 
per 
annum, 
with 
correspondingly 
extensive 
coal, 
ore 
and 
blast 
furnace 
operations, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
manufacturing 
of 
finished 
goods, 
employing 
10,000 
workers 
quartered 
in 
company 
houses, 
sometimes 
owning 
their 
own 
wharves 
and 
railways, 
are 
today 
the 
standard 
type 
of 
German 
iron 
and 
steel 
plant. 
And 
concentration 
continues. 
Individual 
enterprises 
are 
becoming 
larger 
and 
larger. 
An 
ever 
increasing 
number 
of 
enterprises 
in 
one 
given 
industry, 
or 
in 
several 
different 
industries, 
join 
together 
in 
giant 
combines, 
backed 
up 
and 
controlled 
by 
half 
a 
dozen 
Berlin 
banks. 
In 
the 
German 
mining 
industry, 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
teachings 
of 
Karl 
Marx 
on 
the 
concentration 
of 
capital 
is 
definitely 
proved, 
at 
any 
rate 
in 
a 
country 
where 
it 
is 
protected 
by 
tariffs 
and 
freight 
rates. 
The 
German 
mining 
industry 
is 
ripe 
for 
expropriation.” 


Such 
is 
the 
conclusion 
which 
a 
conscientious 
bourgeois 
economist, 
and 
such 
are 
exceptional, 
had 
to 
arrive 
at. 
It 
must 
be 
noted 
that 
he 
seems 
to 
place 
Germany 
in 
a 
special 
category 
because 
her 
industries 
are 
protected 
by 
high 
tariffs. 
But 
the 
concentration 
of 
industry 
and 
the 
formation 
of 
monopolist, 
manufacturers’ 
combines, 
cartels, 
syndicates, 
etc., 
could 
only 
be 
accelerated 
by 
these 
circumstances. 
It 
is 
extremely 
important 
to 
note 
that 
in 
free 
trade 
England, 
concentration 
also 
leads 
to 
monopoly, 
although 
somewhat 
later 
and 
perhaps 
in 
another 
form. 
Professor 
Hermann 
Levy, 
in 
his 
special 
investigation 
entitled 
Monopolies, 
Cartels 
and 
Trusts, 
based 
on 
data 
on 



British 
economic 
development, 
writes 
as 
follows: 


“In 
Great 
Britain 
it 
is 
the 
size 
of 
the 
enterprise 
and 
its 
capacity 
which 
harbor 
a 
monopolist 
tendency. 
This, 
for 
one 
thing, 
is 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
great 
investment 
of 
capital 
per 
enterprise, 
once 
the 
concentration 
movement 
has 
commenced, 
gives 
rise 
to 
increasing 
demands 
for 
new 
capital 
for 
the 
new 
enterprises 
and 
thereby 
renders 
their 
launching 
more 
difficult. 
Moreover 
(and 
this 
seems 
to 
us 
to 
be 
the 
more 
important 
point), 
every 
new 
enterprise 
that 
wants 
to 
keep 
pace 
with 
the 
gigantic 
enterprises 
that 
have 
arisen 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
process 
of 
concentration 
produces 
such 
an 
enormous 
quantity 
of 
surplus 
goods 
that 
it 
can 
only 
dispose 
of 
them 
either 
by 
being 
able 
to 
sell 
them 
profitably 
as 
a 
result 
of 
an 
enormous 
increase 
in 
demand 
or 
by 
immediately 
forcing 
down 
prices 
to 
a 
level 
that 
would 
be 
unprofitable 
both 
for 
itself 
and 
for 
the 
monopoly 
combines.” 


In 
England, 
unlike 
other 
countries 
where 
the 
protective 
tariffs 
facilitate 
the 
formation 
of 
cartels, 
monopolist 
alliances 
of 
entrepreneurs, 
cartels 
and 
trusts, 
arise 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
cases 
only 
when 
the 
number 
of 
competing 
enterprises 
is 
reduced 
to 
a 
“couple 
of 
dozen 
or 
so.” 
“Here 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
concentration 
movement 
on 
the 
formation 
of 
large 
industrial 
monopolies 
in 
a 
whole 
sphere 
of 
industry 
stands 
out 
with 
crystal 
clarity.” 


Fifty 
years 
ago, 
when 
Marx 
was 
writing 
Capital, 
free 
competition 
appeared 
to 
most 
economists 
to 
be 
a 
“natural 
law.” 
The 
official 
scientists 
tried, 
by 
a 
conspiracy 
of 
silence, 
to 
kill 
the 
works 
of 
Marx, 
which 
by 
a 
theoretical 
and 
historical 
analysis 
of 
capitalism 
showed 
that 
free 
competition 
gives 
rise 
to 
the 
concentration 
of 
production, 
which, 
in 
turn, 
at 
a 
certain 
stage 
of 
development, 
leads 
to 
monopoly. 
Today, 
monopoly 
has 
become 
a 
fact. 
The 
economists 
are 
writing 
mountains 
of 
books 
in 
which 
they 
describe 
the 
diverse 
manifestations 
of 
monopoly, 
and 
continue 
to 
declare 
in 
chorus 
that 
“Marxism 
is 
refuted.” 
But 
facts 
are 
stubborn 
things, 
as 
the 
English 
proverb 
says, 
and 
they 
have 
to 
be 
reckoned 
with, 
whether 
we 
like 
it 
or 
not. 
The 
facts 
show 
that 
differences 
between 
capitalist 
countries, 
e.g., 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
protection 
or 
free 
trade, 
only 
give 
rise 
to 
insignificant 
variations 
in 
the 
form 
of 
monopolies 
or 
in 
the 
moment 
of 
their 
appearance, 
and 
that 
the 
rise 
of 
monopolies, 
as 
the 
result 
of 
the 
concentration 
of 
production, 
is 
a 
general 
and 
fundamental 
law 
of 
the 
present 
stage 
of 
development 
of 
capitalism. 


For 
Europe, 
the 
time 
when 
the 
new 
capitalism 
was 
definitely 
substituted 
for 
the 
old 
can 
be 
established 
fairly 
precisely: 
it 
was 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century. 
In 
one 
of 
the 
latest 
compilations 
on 
the 
history 
of 
the 



“formation 
of 
monopolies,” 
we 
read: 


“A 
few 
isolated 
examples 
of 
capitalist 
monopoly 
could 
be 
cited 
from 
the 
period 
preceding 
1860; 
in 
these 
could 
be 
discerned 
the 
embryo 
of 
the 
forms 
that 
are 
common 
today; 
but 
all 
undoubtedly 
represent 
pre-history. 
The 
real 
beginning 
of 
modern 
monopoly 
goes 
back, 
at 
the 
earliest, 
to 
the 
‘sixties. 
The 
first 
important 
period 
of 
development 
of 
monopoly 
commenced 
with 
the 
international 
industrial 
depression 
of 
the 
’seventies 
and 
lasted 
until 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
‘nineties.... 
If 
we 
examine 
the 
question 
on 
a 
European 
scale, 
we 
will 
find 
that 
the 
development 
of 
free 
competition 
reached 
its 
apex 
in 
the 
’sixties 
and 
’seventies. 
Then 
it 
was 
that 
England 
completed 
the 
construction 
of 
its 
old 
style 
capitalist 
organization. 
In 
Germany, 
this 
organization 
had 
entered 
into 
a 
decisive 
struggle 
with 
handicraft 
and 
domestic 
industry, 
and 
had 
begun 
to 
create 
for 
itself 
its 
own 
forms 
of 
existence....” 


‘The 
great 
revolutionization 
commenced 
with 
the 
crash 
of 
1873, 
or 
rather, 
the 
depression 
which 
followed 
it 
and 
which, 
with 
hardly 
discernible 
interruptions 
in 
the 
early 
’eighties 
and 
the 
unusually 
violent, 
but 
short-lived 
boom 
about 
1889, 
marks 
twenty-two 
years 
of 
European 
economic 
history. 
During 
the 
short 
boom 
of 
1889-90, 
the 
system 
of 
cartels 
was 
widely 
resorted 
to 
in 
order 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
favorable 
business 
conditions. 
An 
ill-
considered 
policy 
drove 
prices 
still 
higher 
than 
would 
have 
been 
the 
case 
otherwise 
and 
nearly 
all 
these 
cartels 
perished 
ingloriously 
in 
the 
smash. 
Another 
five-year 
period 
of 
bad 
trade 
and 
low 
prices 
followed, 
but 
a 
new 
spirit 
reigned 
in 
industry; 
the 
depression 
was 
no 
longer 
regarded 
as 
something 
to 
be 
taken 
for 
granted: 
it 
was 
regarded 
as 
nothing 
more 
than 
a 
pause 
before 
another 
boom. 


“The 
cartel 
movement 
entered 
its 
second 
epoch. 
Instead 
of 
being 
a 
transitory 
phenomenon, 
the 
cartels 
became 
one 
of 
the 
foundations 
of 
economic 
life. 
They 
are 
winning 
one 
field 
after 
another, 
primarily, 
the 
raw 
materials 
industry. 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
‘nineties 
the 
cartel 
system 
had 
already 
acquired—in 
the 
organization 
of 
the 
coke 
syndicate 
on 
the 
model 
of 
which 
the 
coal 
syndicate 
was 
later 
formed—a 
cartel 
technique 
which 
could 
hardly 
be 
improved. 
For 
the 
first 
time 
the 
great 
boom 
at 
the 
close 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
and 
the 
crisis 
of 
1900-03 
occurred 
entirely—in 
the 
mining 
and 
iron 
industries 
at 
least—under 
the 
aegis 
of 
the 
cartels. 
And 
while 
at 
that 
time 
it 
appeared 
to 
be 
something 
novel, 
now 
the 
general 
public 
takes 
it 
for 
granted 
that 
large 
spheres 
of 
economy 
have 
been, 
as 
a 
general 
rule, 
systematically 
removed 
from 
the 
realm 
of 
free 
competition.” 



Thus, 
the 
principal 
stages 
in 
the 
history 
of 
monopolies 
are 
the 
following: 


1) 
1860-70, 
the 
highest 
stage, 
the 
apex 
of 
development 
of 
free 
competition; 
monopoly 
is 
in 
the 
barely 
discernible, 
embryonic 
stage. 
2) 
After 
the 
crisis 
of 
1873, 
a 
wide 
zone 
of 
development 
of 
cartels; 
but 
they 
are 
still 
the 
exception. 
They 
are 
not 
yet 
durable. 
They 
are 
still 
a 
transitory 
phenomenon. 
3) 
The 
boom 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
and 
the 
crisis 
of 
1900-03. 
Cartels 
become 
one 
of 
the 
foundations 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
economic 
life. 
Capitalism 
has 
been 
transformed 
into 
imperialism. 
Cartels 
come 
to 
agreement 
on 
the 
conditions 
of 
sale, 
terms 
of 
payment, 
etc. 
They 
divide 
the 
markets 
among 
themselves. 
They 
fix 
the 
quantity 
of 
goods 
to 
be 
produced. 
They 
fix 
prices. 
They 
divide 
the 
profits 
among 
the 
various 
enterprises, 
etc. 


The 
number 
of 
cartels 
in 
Germany 
was 
estimated 
at 
about 
250 
in 
1896 
and 
at 
385 
in 
1905, 
with 
about 
12,000 
firms 
participating. 
But 
it 
is 
generally 
recognized 
that 
these 
figures 
are 
underestimations. 
From 
the 
statistics 
of 
German 
industry 
for 
1907 
we 
quoted 
above, 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
even 
12,000 
large 
enterprises 
must 
certainly 
utilize 
more 
than 
half 
the 
steam 
and 
electric 
power 
used 
in 
the 
country. 
In 
the 
United 
States, 
the 
number 
of 
trusts 
in 
1900 
was 
185, 
and 
in 
1907, 
250. 
American 
statistics 
divide 
all 
enterprises 
into 
three 
categories, 
according 
to 
whether 
they 
belong 
to 
individuals, 
to 
private 
firms 
or 
to 
corporations. 
These 
latter 
in 
1904 
comprised 
23.6 
per 
cent, 
and 
in 
1909, 
25.9 
per 
cent 
(i.e., 
more 
than 
one-fourth 
of 
the 
total 
industrial 
enterprises 
in 
the 
country). 
These 
employed 
in 
1904, 
70.6 
per 
cent, 
and 
in 
1909, 
75.6 
per 
cent 
(i.e., 
more 
than 
three-fourths) 
of 
the 
total 
wage 
earners. 
Their 
output 
amounted 
at 
these 
two 
dates 
to 
$10,900,000,000 
and 
to 
$16,300,000,000 
respectively, 
i.e., 
to 
73.7 
per 
cent 
and 
to 
79 
per 
cent 
of 
the 
total. 


Not 
infrequently, 
cartels 
and 
trusts 
concentrate 
in 
their 
hands 
seven 
or 
eight-tenths 
of 
the 
total 
output 
of 
a 
given 
branch 
of 
industry. 
The 
Rhine-
Westphalian 
Coal 
Syndicate, 
at 
its 
foundation 
in 
1893, 
controlled 
86.7 
per 
cent 
of 
the 
total 
coal 
output 
of 
the 
area. 
In 
1910, 
it 
controlled 
95.4 
per 
cent. 
The 
monopoly 
so 
created 
ensures 
enormous 
profits, 
and 
leads 
to 
the 
formation 
of 
technical 
productive 
units 
of 
formidable 
magnitude. 
The 
famous 
Standard 
Oil 
Company 
in 
the 
United 
States 
was 
founded 
in 
1900: 


“It 
has 
an 
authorized 
capital 
of 
$150,000,000. 
It 
issued 
$100,000,000 
worth 
of 
common 
shares 
and 
$106,000,000 
worth 
of 
preferred 
shares. 
From 
1900 
to 
1907 
they 
earned 
the 
following 
dividends: 
48, 
48, 
45, 
44, 
36, 
40, 
40, 



40 
per 
cent, 
in 
the 
respective 
years, 
i.e., 
in 
all, 
$367,000,000. 
From 
1882 
to 
1907 
the 
Standard 
Oil 
Company 
made 
clear 
profits 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
$889,000,000 
of 
which 
$606,000,000 
were 
distributed 
in 
dividends, 
and 
the 
rest 
went 
to 
reserve 
capital.... 
In 
1907 
the 
various 
enterprises 
of 
the 
United 
States 
Steel 
Corporation 
employed 
no 
less 
than 
210,180 
workers 
and 
other 
employees. 
The 
largest 
enterprise 
in 
the 
German 
mining 
industry, 
the 
Gelsenkirchen 
Mining 
Company 
(Gelsenkirchner 
Berg-werksgesellschaft 
), 
employed, 
in 
1908, 
46,048 
wage 
earners.” 


In 
1902, 
the 
United 
States 
Steel 
Corporation 
produced 
9,000,000 
tons 
of 
steel. 
Its 
output 
constituted, 
in 
1901, 
66.3 
per 
cent, 
and 
in 
1908, 
56.1 
per 
cent 
of 
the 
total 
output 
of 
steel 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
Its 
share 
of 
the 
output 
of 
mineral 
ore 
increased 
from 
43.9 
per 
cent 
to 
46.3 
per 
cent 
of 
the 
total 
output 
in 
the 
same 
period. 


The 
report 
of 
the 
American 
government 
commission 
on 
trusts 
states: 


“Their 
superiority 
over 
their 
competitors 
is 
due 
to 
the 
magnitude 
of 
their 
enterprises 
and 
their 
excellent 
technical 
equipment. 
Since 
its 
inception, 
the 
tobacco 
trust 
devoted 
all 
its 
efforts 
to 
the 
substitution 
of 
mechanical 
for 
manual 
labor 
on 
an 
extensive 
scale. 
With 
this 
end 
in 
view, 
it 
bought 
up 
all 
patents 
that 
had 
anything 
to 
do 
with 
the 
manufacture 
of 
tobacco 
and 
spent 
enormous 
sums 
for 
this 
purpose. 
Many 
of 
these 
patents 
at 
first 
proved 
to 
be 
of 
no 
use, 
and 
had 
to 
be 
modified 
by 
the 
engineers 
employed 
by 
the 
trust. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
1906, 
two 
subsidiary 
companies 
were 
formed 
solely 
to 
acquire 
patents. 
With 
the 
same 
object 
in 
view, 
the 
trust 
built 
its 
own 
foundries, 
machine 
shops 
and 
repair 
shops. 
One 
of 
these 
establishments, 
that 
in 
Brooklyn, 
employs 
on 
the 
average 
300 
workers; 
there 
experiments 
are 
carried 
out 
on 
inventions 
concerning 
the 
manufacture 
of 
cigarettes, 
cheroots, 
snuff, 
tinfoil 
for 
packing, 
boxes, 
etc. 
Here, 
also, 
inventions 
are 
perfected. 


“Other 
trusts 
employ 
so-called 
developing 
engineers 
whose 
business 
it 
is 
to 
devise 
new 
methods 
of 
production, 
think 
out 
new 
production 
processes 
and 
to 
test 
technical 
improvements. 
The 
United 
States 
Steel 
Corporation 
grants 
big 
bonuses 
to 
its 
workers 
and 
engineers 
for 
all 
inventions 
suitable 
for 
raising 
technical 
efficiency, 
for 
improving 
machinery 
or 
for 
reducing 
costs 
of 
production.” 


In 
German 
large-scale 
industry, 
e.g., 
in 
the 
chemical 
industry, 
which 
has 
developed 
so 
enormously 
during 
these 
last 
few 
decades, 
the 
promotion 
of 
technical 
improvement 
is 
organized 
in 
the 
same 
way. 
In 
1908, 
the 
process 
of 
concentration 
had 
already 
given 
rise 
to 
two 
main 
groups 
which, 
in 
their 
way, 



came 
close 
to 
being 
monopolies. 
First 
these 
groups 
represented 
“dual 
alliances” 
of 
two 
pairs 
of 
big 
factories, 
each 
having 
a 
capital 
of 
from 
twenty 
to 
twenty-one 
million 
marks: 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
the 
former 
Meister 
Factory 
at 
Höchst 
and 
the 
Cas-sel 
Factory 
at 
Frankfurt-on-Main; 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
aniline 
and 
soda 
factory 
at 
Ludwigshafen 
and 
the 
former 
Bayer 
Factory 
at 
Elberfeld. 
In 
1905, 
one 
of 
these 
groups, 
and 
in 
1908 
the 
other 
group, 
each 
concluded 
a 
separate 
agreement 
with 
yet 
another 
factory. 
The 
result 
was 
the 
formation 
of 
two 
“triple 
alliances,” 
each 
with 
a 
capital 
of 
from 
forty 
to 
fifty 
million 
marks. 
And 
these 
“alliances” 
began 
to 
come 
“close” 
to 
one 
another, 
to 
reach 
“an 
understanding” 
about 
prices, 
etc.102 


Competition 
becomes 
transformed 
into 
monopoly. 
The 
result 
is 
immense 
progress 
in 
the 
socialization 
of 
production. 
In 
particular, 
the 
process 
of 
technical 
invention 
and 
improvement 
becomes 
socialized. 


This 
is 
no 
longer 
the 
old 
type 
of 
free 
competition 
between 
manufacturers, 
scattered 
and 
out 
of 
touch 
with 
one 
another, 
and 
producing 
for 
an 
unknown 
market. 
Concentration 
has 
reached 
the 
point 
at 
which 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
make 
an 
approximate 
estimate 
of 
all 
sources 
of 
raw 
material 
(for 
example, 
the 
iron 
ore 
deposits) 
of 
a 
country 
and 
even, 
as 
we 
shall 
see, 
of 
several 
countries, 
or 
of 
the 
whole 
world. 
Not 
only 
are 
such 
estimates 
made, 
but 
these 
sources 
are 
captured 
by 
gigantic 
monopolist 
alliances. 
An 
approximate 
estimate 
of 
the 
capacity 
of 
markets 
is 
also 
made, 
and 
the 
trusts 
divide 
them 
up 
among 
themselves 
by 
agreement. 
Skilled 
labor 
power 
is 
monopolized, 
the 
best 
engineers 
are 
engaged; 
the 
means 
of 
transport 
are 
captured: 
railways 
in 
America, 
shipping 
companies 
in 
Europe 
and 
America. 
Capitalism 
in 
its 
imperialist 
stage 
arrives 
at 
the 
threshold 
of 
the 
most 
complete 
socialization 
of 
production. 
In 
spite 
of 
themselves 
the 
capitalists 
are 
dragged, 
as 
it 
were, 
into 
the 
new 
social 
order, 
which 
marks 
the 
transition 
from 
complete 
free 
competition 
to 
complete 
socialization. 
Production 
becomes 
social, 
but 
appropriation 
remains 
private. 
The 
social 
means 
of 
production 
remain 
the 
private 
property 
of 
a 
few. 
The 
framework 
of 
formally 
recognized 
free 
competition 
remains, 
but 
the 
yoke 
of 
a 
few 
monopolists 
on 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
population 
becomes 
a 
hundred 
times 
heavier, 
more 
burdensome 
and 
intolerable. 


The 
German 
economist, 
Kestner, 
has 
written 
a 
book 
especially 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
“the 
struggle 
between 
the 
cartels 
and 
outsiders,” 
i.e., 
enterprises 
outside 
the 
cartels. 
He 
entitled 
his 
work 
Compulsory 
Organization, 
although, 
in 
order 
to 
present 
capitalism 
in 
its 
true 
light, 
he 
should 
have 
given 
it 
the 
title: 



“Compulsory 
Submission 
to 
Monopolist 
Combines.” 
This 
book 
is 
edifying 
if 
only 
for 
the 
list 
it 
gives 
of 
the 
modern 
and 
civilized 
methods 
that 
monopolist 
combines 
resort 
to 
in 
their 
striving 
towards 
“organization.” 


They 
are 
as 
follows: 
1) 
Stopping 
supplies 
of 
raw 
materials 
(“one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
methods 
of 
compelling 
adherence 
to 
the 
cartel”); 
2) 
Stopping 
the 
supply 
of 
labor 
by 
means 
of 
“alliances” 
(i.e., 
of 
agreements 
between 
employers 
and 
the 
trade 
unions 
by 
which 
the 
latter 
permit 
their 
members 
to 
work 
only 
in 
trustified 
enterprises); 
3) 
Cutting 
off 
deliveries; 
4) 
Closing 
of 
trade 
outlets; 
5) 
Agreements 
with 
the 
buyers, 
by 
which 
the 
latter 
undertake 
to 
trade 
only 
with 
the 
cartels; 
6) 
The 
systematic 
lowering 
of 
prices 
to 
ruin 
“outside” 
firms, 
i.e., 
those 
who 
refuse 
to 
submit 
to 
the 
trust. 
Millions 
are 
spent 
in 
order 
to 
sell 
goods 
for 
a 
certain 
time 
below 
their 
cost 
price 
(the 
price 
of 
benzine 
was 
thus 
lowered 
from 
40 
to 
22 
marks, 
i.e., 
reduced 
almost 
by 
half!); 
7) 
Stopping 
credits; 
8) 
Boycott. 


This 
is 
no 
longer 
competition 
between 
small 
and 
large-scale 
industry, 
or 
between 
technically 
developed 
and 
backward 
enterprises. 
We 
see 
here 
the 
monopolies 
throttling 
those 
which 
do 
not 
submit 
to 
them, 
to 
their 
yoke, 
to 
their 
dictation. 
The 
following 
is 
the 
way 
in 
which 
this 
process 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
a 
bourgeois 
economist: 


“Even 
in 
the 
purely 
economic 
sphere,” 
writes 
Kestner, 
“a 
certain 
change 
is 
taking 
place 
from 
commercial 
activity 
in 
the 
old 
sense 
of 
the 
word 
to 
organizational-speculative 
activity. 
The 
greatest 
success 
no 
longer 
goes 
to 
the 
merchant 
whose 
technical 
and 
commercial 
experience 
enables 
him 
best 
of 
all 
to 
estimate 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
buyer, 
and, 
so 
to 
say, 
to 
‘discover’ 
latent 
demand; 
it 
goes 
to 
the 
speculative 
genius” 
(?!) 
“who 
knows 
how 
to 
estimate 
in 
advance, 
or 
even 
only 
to 
sense 
the 
organizational 
development 
and 
the 
possibilities 
of 
connections 
between 
individual 
enterprises 
and 
the 
banks.” 


Translated 
into 
ordinary 
human 
language 
this 
means 
that 
the 
development 
of 
capitalism 
has 
arrived 
at 
a 
stage 
when, 
although 
commodity 
production 
still 
“reigns” 
and 
continues 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
the 
basis 
of 
economic 
life, 
it 
has 
in 
reality 
been 
undermined 
and 
the 
big 
profits 
go 
to 
the 
“genius” 
of 
financial 
manipulation. 
At 
the 
basis 
of 
these 
swindles 
and 
manipulations 
lies 
socialized 
production; 
but 
the 
immense 
progress 
of 
humanity, 
which 
achieved 
this 
socialization, 
entirely 
goes 
to 
benefit 
the 
speculators. 
We 
shall 
see 
later 
how 
“on 
these 
grounds” 
reactionary, 
petty-bourgeois 
critics 
of 
capitalist 
imperialism 
dream 
of 
taking 
a 
step 
backward, 
of 
a 
return 
to 
“free,” 
“peaceful” 
and 
“honest” 
competition. 



“The 
prolonged 
raising 
of 
prices 
which 
results 
from 
the 
formation 
of 
cartels,” 
says 
Kestner, 
“has 
hitherto 
been 
observed 
only 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
most 
important 
means 
of 
production, 
such 
as 
coal, 
iron 
and 
potassium, 
and 
has 
never 
been 
observed 
for 
any 
length 
of 
time 
in 
relation 
to 
manufactured 
goods. 
Similarly, 
the 
increase 
in 
profits 
resulting 
from 
that 
has 
been 
limited 
only 
to 
the 
industries 
which 
produce 
means 
of 
production. 
To 
this 
observation 
we 
must 
add 
that 
the 
raw 
materials 
industry 
secures 
advantages 
from 
the 
cartel 
formation 
not 
only 
in 
regard 
to 
growth 
of 
income 
and 
profitableness, 
to 
the 
detriment 
of 
the 
finished 
goods 
industry, 
but 
also 
a 
dominating 
position 
over 
the 
latter, 
which 
did 
not 
exist 
under 
free 
competition.” 


The 
words 
which 
we 
have 
italicized 
reveal 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
case 
which 
the 
bourgeois 
economists 
admit 
so 
rarely 
and 
so 
unwillingly, 
and 
which 
the 
modern 
defenders 
of 
opportunism, 
led 
by 
K. 
Kautsky, 
so 
zealously 
try 
to 
evade 
and 
brush 
aside. 
Domination 
and 
violence 
that 
is 
associated 
with 
it— 
such 
are 
the 
relationships 
that 
are 
most 
typical 
of 
the 
“latest 
phase 
of 
capitalist 
development”; 
this 
is 
what 
must 
inevitably 
result, 
and 
has 
resulted, 
from 
the 
formation 
of 
all-powerful 
economic 
monopolies. 


We 
will 
give 
one 
more 
example 
of 
the 
methods 
employed 
by 
monopolies. 
It 
is 
particularly 
easy 
for 
cartels 
and 
monopolies 
to 
arise 
when 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
capture 
all 
the 
sources 
of 
raw 
materials, 
or 
at 
least 
the 
most 
important 
of 
them. 
It 
would 
be 
wrong, 
however, 
to 
assume 
that 
monopolies 
do 
not 
arise 
in 
other 
industries 
in 
which 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
corner 
the 
sources 
of 
raw 
materials. 
The 
cement 
industry, 
for 
instance, 
can 
find 
its 
raw 
material 
everywhere. 
Yet 
in 
Germany 
it 
is 
strongly 
trustified. 
The 
cement 
manufacturers 
have 
formed 
regional 
syndicates: 
South 
German, 
Rhine-
Westphalian, 
etc. 
The 
prices 
fixed 
are 
monopoly 
prices: 
230 
to 
280 
marks 
a 
carload 
(at 
a 
cost 
price 
of 
180 
marks). 
The 
enterprises 
pay 
a 
dividend 
of 
from 
12 
per 
cent 
to 
16 
percent—and 
let 
us 
not 
forget 
that 
the 
“geniuses” 
of 
modern 
speculation 
know 
how 
to 
pocket 
big 
profits 
besides 
those 
they 
draw 
by 
way 
of 
dividends. 
Now, 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
competition 
in 
such 
a 
profitable 
industry, 
the 
monopolists 
resort 
to 
sundry 
stratagems. 
For 
example, 
they 
spread 
disquieting 
rumors 
about 
the 
situation 
of 
their 
industry. 
Anonymous 
warnings 
are 
published 
in 
the 
newspapers, 
like 
the 
following: 
“Investors, 
don’t 
place 
your 
capital 
in 
the 
cement 
industry!” 
They 
buy 
up 
“outsiders” 
(those 
outside 
the 
trusts) 
and 
pay 
them 
“indemnities” 
of 
60,000, 
80,000 
and 
even 
150,000 
marks. 
Monopoly 
hews 
a 
path 
for 
itself 
without 
scruple 
as 
to 



the 
means, 
from 
“modestly” 
buying 
off 
competitors 
to 
the 
American 
device 
of 
“employing” 
dynamite 
against 
them. 


The 
statement 
that 
cartels 
can 
abolish 
crises 
is 
a 
fable 
spread 
by 
bourgeois 
economists 
who 
at 
all 
costs 
desire 
to 
place 
capitalism 
in 
a 
favorable 
light. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
when 
monopoly 
appears 
in 
certain 
branches 
of 
industry, 
it 
increases 
and 
intensifies 
the 
anarchy 
inherent 
in 
capitalist 
production 
as 
a 
whole. 
The 
disparity 
between 
the 
development 
of 
agriculture 
and 
that 
of 
industry 
which 
is 
characteristic 
of 
capitalism, 
is 
increased. 
The 
privileged 
position 
of 
the 
most 
highly 
trustified 
industry, 
i.e., 
so-called 
heavy 
industry, 
especially 
coal 
and 
iron, 
causes 
“a 
still 
greater 
lack 
of 
concerted 
organization” 
in 
other 
branches 
of 
production—as 
Jeidels, 
the 
author 
of 
one 
of 
the 
best 
works 
on 
the 
relationship 
of 
the 
German 
big 
banks 
to 
industry, 
puts 
it. 


“The 
more 
developed 
an 
economic 
system 
is,” 
writes 
Liefmann, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
unblushing 
apologists 
of 
capitalism, 
“the 
more 
it 
resorts 
to 
risky 
enterprises, 
or 
enterprises 
abroad, 
to 
those 
which 
need 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
time 
to 
develop, 
or 
finally 
to 
those 
which 
are 
only 
of 
local 
importance.” 


The 
increased 
risk 
is 
connected 
in 
the 
long 
run 
with 
the 
prodigious 
increase 
of 
capital, 
which 
overflows 
the 
brim, 
as 
it 
were, 
flows 
abroad, 
etc. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
the 
extremely 
rapid 
rate 
of 
technical 
progress 
gives 
rise 
more 
and 
more 
to 
disturbances 
in 
the 
co-ordination 
between 
the 
various 
spheres 
of 
industry, 
to 
anarchy 
and 
crisis. 
Liefmann 
is 
obliged 
to 
admit 
that: 


“In 
all 
probability 
mankind 
will 
see 
further 
important 
technical 
revolutions 
in 
the 
near 
future 
which 
will 
also 
affect 
the 
economic 
system 
... 
for 
example, 
electricity 
and 
aviation.... 
As 
a 
general 
rule, 
in 
such 
a 
period 
of 
radical 
economic 
change, 
speculation 
becomes 
rife.” 


Crises 
of 
every 
kind—economic 
crises 
more 
frequently, 
but 
not 
only 
these—in 
their 
turn 
increase 
very 
considerably 
the 
tendency 
towards 
concentration 
and 
monopoly. 
In 
this 
connection, 
the 
following 
reflections 
of 
Jeidels 
on 
the 
crisis 
of 
1900, 
which 
was, 
as 
we 
have 
already 
seen, 
the 
turning 
point 
in 
the 
history 
of 
modern 
monopoly, 
are 
exceedingly 
instructive. 


“Side 
by 
side 
with 
the 
giant 
plants 
in 
the 
basic 
industries, 
the 
crisis 
of 
1900 
found 
many 
plants 
organized 
on 
lines 
that 
today 
would 
be 
considered 
obsolete, 
the 
‘pure’ 
[non-combined] 
plants, 
which 
had 
also 
arisen 
on 
the 
crest 
of 
the 
industrial 
boom. 
The 
fall 
in 
prices 
and 
the 
falling 
off 
in 
demand 
put 
these 
‘pure’ 
enterprises 
in 
a 
precarious 
position, 
but 
did 
not 
affect 
some 
of 
the 
big 
combined 
enterprises 
at 
all 
and 
affected 
others 
only 
for 
a 
very 
short 



time. 
As 
a 
consequence 
of 
this 
the 
crisis 
of 
1900 
resulted 
in 
a 
far 
greater 
concentration 
of 
industry 
than 
the 
former 
crises, 
like 
that 
of 
1873. 
The 
latter 
crisis 
also 
produced 
a 
sort 
of 
selection 
of 
the 
best 
equipped 
enterprises, 
but 
owing 
to 
the 
level 
of 
technical 
development 
of 
that 
time, 
this 
selection 
could 
not 
place 
the 
firms 
which 
successfully 
emerged 
from 
the 
crisis 
in 
a 
position 
of 
monopoly. 
Such 
a 
durable 
monopoly 
exists 
to 
a 
high 
degree 
in 
the 
gigantic 
enterprises 
in 
the 
present 
iron 
and 
steel 
and 
electric 
industries, 
and 
to 
a 
lesser 
degree, 
in 
the 
engineering 
industry 
and 
certain 
metal, 
transport 
and 
other 
enterprises 
in 
consequence 
of 
their 
complicated 
technique, 
their 
extensive 
organization 
and 
the 
magnitude 
of 
their 
capital.” 


Monopoly! 
This 
is 
the 
last 
word 
in 
the 
“latest 
phase 
of 
capitalist 
development.” 
But 
we 
shall 
only 
have 
a 
very 
insufficient, 
incomplete 
and 
poor 
notion 
of 
the 
real 
power 
and 
significance 
of 
modern 
monopolies 
if 
we 
do 
not 
take 
into 
consideration 
the 
part 
played 
by 
the 
banks. 



Chapter 
Ii 


The 
Banks 
And 
Their 
New 
Role 


The 
principal 
and 
primary 
function 
of 
banks 
is 
to 
serve 
as 
an 
intermediary 
in 
the 
making 
of 
payments. 
In 
doing 
so 
they 
transform 
inactive 
money 
capital 
into 
active 
capital, 
that 
is, 
into 
capital 
producing 
a 
profit; 
they 
collect 
all 
kinds 
of 
money 
revenues 
and 
place 
them 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
the 
capitalist 
class. 


As 
banking 
develops 
and 
becomes 
concentrated 
in 
a 
small 
number 
of 
establishments, 
the 
banks 
become 
transformed, 
and 
instead 
of 
being 
modest 
intermediaries 
they 
become 
powerful 
monopolies 
having 
at 
their 
command 
almost 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
money 
capital 
of 
all 
the 
capitalists 
and 
small 
businessmen 
and 
also 
a 
large 
part 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
and 
of 
the 
sources 
of 
raw 
materials 
of 
the 
given 
country 
and 
of 
a 
number 
of 
countries. 
The 
transformation 
of 
numerous 
intermediaries 
into 
a 
handful 
of 
monopolists 
represents 
one 
of 
the 
fundamental 
processes 
in 
the 
transformation 
of 
capitalism 
into 
capitalist 
imperialism. 
For 
this 
reason 
we 
must 
first 
of 
all 
deal 
with 
the 
concentration 
of 
banking. 


In 
1907-08, 
the 
combined 
deposits 
of 
the 
German 
joint 
stock 
banks, 
having 
a 
capital 
of 
more 
than 
a 
million 
marks, 
amounted 
to 
7,000,000,000 
marks, 
while 
in 
1912-13, 
they 
amounted 
to 
9,800,000,000 
marks. 
Thus, 
in 
five 
years 
their 
deposits 
increased 
by 
40 
per 
cent. 
Of 
the 
2,800,000,000 
increase, 
2,750,000,000 
was 
divided 
among 
57 
banks, 
each 
having 
a 
capital 
of 
more 
than 
10,000,000 
marks. 
The 
distribution 
of 
the 
deposits 
among 
big 
and 
small 
banks 
was 
as 
follows: 


PERCENTAGE 
OF 
TOTAL 
DEPOSITS 


The 
small 
banks 
are 
being 
squeezed 
out 
by 
the 
big 
banks, 
of 
which 
nine 
concentrate 
in 
their 
own 
hands 
almost 
half 
the 
total 
deposits. 
But 
we 
have 
left 
out 
of 
account 
many 
important 
details, 
for 
instance, 
the 
transformation 
of 
numerous 
small 
banks 
practically 
into 
branches 
of 
big 
banks, 
etc. 
Of 
this 
we 
shall 
speak 
later 
on. 


At 
the 
end 
of 
1913, 
Schulze-Gävernitz 
estimated 
the 
deposits 
in 
the 
nine 
big 
Berlin 
banks 
at 
5,100,000,000 
marks, 
out 
of 
a 
total 
of 
about 
10,000,000,000 
marks. 
Taking 
into 
account 
not 
only 
the 
deposits, 
but 
also 
the 
capital 
of 
these 
banks, 
this 
author 
wrote: 


“At 
the 
end 
of 
1909, 
the 
nine 
big 
Berlin 
banks, 
together 
with 
their 



τffiliated 
institutions, 
controlled 
11,276,000,000 
marks, 
that 
is, 
about 
83 
per 
cent 
of 
the 
total 
German 
bank 
capital. 
The 
Deutsche 
Bank, 
which, 
together 
with 
its 
affiliated 
banks, 
controls 
nearly 
3,000,000,000 
marks, 
represents, 
parallel 
with 
the 
Prussian 
State 
Railway 
Administration, 
the 
biggest 
and 
also 
the 
most 
decentralized 
accumulation 
of 
capital 
in 
the 
old 
world.” 


We 
have 
emphasized 
the 
reference 
to 
the 
“affiliated” 
banks 
because 
this 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
features 
of 
modern 
capitalist 
concentration. 
Large-scale 
enterprises, 
especially 
the 
banks, 
not 
only 
completely 
absorb 
small 
ones, 
but 
also 
“join” 
them 
to 
themselves, 
subordinate 
them, 
bring 
them 
into 
their 
“own” 
group 
or 
“concern” 
(to 
use 
the 
technical 
term) 
by 
having 
“holdings” 
in 
their 
capital, 
by 
purchasing 
or 
exchanging 
shares, 
by 
controlling 
them 
through 
a 
system 
of 
credits, 
etc., 
etc. 
Professor 
Liefmann 
has 
written 
a 
voluminous 
book 
of 
about 
500 
pages 
describing 
modern 
“holding 
and 
finance 
companies,” 
unfortunately 
adding 
“theoretical” 
reflections 
of 
a 
very 
poor 
quality 
to 
what 
is 
frequently 
partly 
digested 
raw 
material. 
To 
what 
results 
this 
“holding” 
system 
leads 
in 
regard 
to 
concentration 
is 
best 
illustrated 
in 
the 
book 
written 
by 
the 
banker, 
Riesser, 
on 
the 
big 
German 
banks. 
But 
before 
examining 
his 
data, 
we 
will 
quote 
an 
example 
of 
the 
“holding” 
system. 


The 
Deutsche 
Bank 
group 
is 
one 
of 
the 
biggest, 
if 
not 
the 
biggest, 
banking 
group. 
In 
order 
to 
trace 
the 
main 
threads 
which 
connect 
all 
the 
banks 
in 
this 
group, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
distinguish 
between 
holdings 
of 
the 
first, 
second 
and 
third 
degree, 
or 
what 
amounts 
to 
the 
same 
thing, 
between 
dependence 
(of 
the 
lesser 
establishments 
on 
the 
Deutsche 
Bank), 
in 
the 
first, 
second 
and 
third 
degree. 
We 
then 
obtain 
the 
following 
picture: 


THE 
DEUTSCHE 
BANK 
HAS 
HOLDINGS: 


Included 
in 
the 
eight 
banks 
dependent 
on 
the 
Deutsche 
Bank 
in 
the 
“first 
degree,” 
“occasionally,” 
there 
are 
three 
foreign 
banks: 
one 
Austrian, 
the 
Wiener 
Bankverein, 
and 
two 
Russian, 
the 
Siberian 
Commercial 
Bank 
and 
the 
Russian 
Bank 
for 
Foreign 
Trade. 
Altogether, 
the 
Deutsche 
Bank 
group 
comprises, 
directly 
and 
indirectly, 
partially 
and 
totally, 
no 
less 
than 
87 
banks; 
and 
the 
capital—its 
own 
and 
others 
which 
it 
controls—ranges 
between 
two 
and 
three 
billion 
marks. 


It 
is 
obvious 
that 
a 
bank 
which 
stands 
at 
the 
head 
of 
such 
a 
group 
and 
which 
enters 
into 
agreement 
with 
a 
half 
dozen 
other 
banks 
only 
slightly 
smaller 
than 
itself 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
conducting 
big 
and 
profitable 
operations 
like 
floating 
state 
loans 
is 
no 
longer 
a 
mere 
“intermediary” 
but 
a 
combine 
of 
a 



handful 
of 
monopolists. 


The 
rapidity 
with 
which 
the 
concentration 
of 
banking 
proceeded 
in 
Germany 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
and 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
twentieth 
centuries 
is 
shown 
by 
the 
following 
data 
which 
we 
quote 
in 
an 
abbreviated 
form 
from 
Riesser: 


Six 
BIG 
BERLIN 
BANKS 


We 
see 
the 
rapid 
extension 
of 
a 
close 
network 
of 
canals 
which 
cover 
the 
whole 
country, 
centralizing 
all 
capital 
and 
all 
revenues, 
transforming 
thousands 
and 
thousands 
of 
scattered 
economic 
enterprises 
into 
a 
single 
national, 
capitalist, 
and 
then 
into 
an 
international, 
capitalist, 
economic 
unit. 
The 
“decentralization” 
that 
Schulze-Gävernitz, 
as 
an 
exponent 
of 
modern 
bourgeois 
political 
economy, 
speaks 
of 
in 
the 
passage 
previously 
quoted 
really 
means 
the 
subordination 
of 
an 
increasing 
number 
of 
formerly 
relatively 
“independent,” 
or 
rather, 
strictly 
local 
economic 
units, 
to 
a 
single 
center. 
In 
reality 
it 
is 
centralization, 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
role, 
the 
importance 
and 
the 
power 
of 
monopolist 
giants. 


In 
the 
old 
capitalist 
countries 
this 
“banking 
network” 
is 
still 
more 
close. 
In 
Great 
Britain 
(including 
Ireland), 
in 
1910, 
there 
were 
7,15i 
branches 
of 
banks. 
Four 
big 
banks 
had 
more 
than 
400 
of 
these 
branches 
each 
(from 
447 
to 
689); 
four 
had 
more 
than 
200 
branches 
each; 
and 
eleven 
more 
than 
100 
each. 


In 
France, 
the 
three 
most 
important 
banks 
(Credit 
Lyonnais, 
the 
Comptoir 
National 
d’Escompte 
de 
Paris 
and 
the 
Société 
Générale) 
extended 
their 
operations 
and 
their 
network 
of 
branches 
in 
the 
following 
manner: 


In 
order 
to 
show 
the 
“connections” 
of 
a 
big 
modern 
bank, 
Riesser 
gives 
the 
following 
figures 
of 
the 
number 
of 
letters 
dispatched 
and 
received 
by 
the 
Disconto-Gesellschaft, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
banks 
in 
Germany 
and 
in 
the 
world, 
the 
capital 
of 
which 
amounted 
to 
300,000,000 
marks 
in 
1914: 


Year 
Letters

Letters

1870 
85,800 
87,513 
1900 
533,102 
626,043 


In 
1875, 
the 
big 
Paris 
bank, 
the 
Crédit 
Lyonnais, 
had 
28,535 
accounts. 
In 
1912 
it 
had 
633,539. 


These 
simple 
figures 
show 
perhaps 
better 
than 
long 
explanations 
how 
the 
concentration 
of 
capital 
and 
the 
growth 
of 
their 
turnover 
is 
radically 
changing 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
banks. 
Scattered 
capitalists 
are 
transformed 
into 
a 



single 
collective 
capitalist. 
When 
carrying 
the 
current 
accounts 
of 
a 
few 
capitalists, 
the 
banks, 
as 
it 
were, 
transact 
a 
purely 
technical 
and 
exclusively 
auxiliary 
operation. 
When, 
however, 
these 
operations 
grow 
to 
enormous 
dimensions 
we 
find 
that 
a 
handful 
of 
monopolists 
control 
all 
the 
operations, 
both 
commercial 
and 
industrial, 
of 
capitalist 
society. 
They 
can, 
by 
means 
of 
their 
banking 
connections, 
by 
running 
current 
accounts 
and 
transacting 
other 
financial 
operations, 
first 
ascertain 
exactly 
the 
position 
of 
the 
various 
capitalists, 
then 
control 
them, 
influence 
them 
by 
restricting 
or 
enlarging, 
facilitating 
or 
hindering 
their 
credits, 
and 
finally 
they 
can 
entirely 
determine 
their 
fate, 
determine 
their 
income, 
deprive 
them 
of 
capital, 
or, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
permit 
them 
to 
increase 
their 
capital 
rapidly 
and 
to 
enormous 
proportions, 
etc. 


We 
have 
just 
mentioned 
the 
300,000,000 
marks 
capital 
of 
the 
Disconto-
Gesellschaft 
of 
Berlin. 
The 
increase 
of 
the 
capital 
of 
this 
bank 
to 
this 
high 
figure 
was 
one 
of 
the 
incidents 
in 
the 
struggle 
for 
hegemony 
between 
two 
of 
the 
biggest 
Berlin 
banks—the 
Deutsche 
Bank 
and 
the 
Disconto. 


In 
1870, 
the 
Deutsche 
Bank, 
a 
new 
enterprise, 
had 
a 
capital 
of 
only 
15,000,000 
marks, 
while 
that 
of 
the 
Disconto 
was 
as 
much 
as 
30,000,000 
marks. 
in 
1908, 
the 
first 
had 
a 
capital 
of 
200,000,000, 
while 
the 
second 
only 
had 
170,000,000. 
In 
1914, 
the 
Deutsche 
Bank 
increased 
its 
capital 
to 
250,000,000 
and 
the 
Disconto, 
by 
absorbing 
a 
very 
important 
bank, 
the 
Schaff-hausenschen 
Bankverein, 
increased 
its 
capital 
to 
300,000,000. 
And, 
of 
course, 
while 
this 
struggle 
for 
hegemony 
goes 
on 
the 
two 
banks 
more 
and 
more 
frequently 
conclude 
“agreements” 
of 
an 
increasingly 
durable 
character 
with 
each 
other. 
This 
development 
of 
banking 
leads 
specialists 
in 
the 
study 
of 
banking 
questions—who 
regard 
economic 
questions 
from 
a 
standpoint 
which 
does 
not 
in 
the 
least 
exceed 
the 
bounds 
of 
the 
most 
moderate 
and 
cautious 
bourgeois 
reformism—to 
the 
following 
conclusions: 


The 
German 
review, 
Die 
Bank, 
commenting 
on 
the 
increase 
of 
the 
capital 
of 
the 
Disconto-Gesellschaft 
to 
300,000,000 
marks, 
writes: 


“Other 
banks 
will 
follow 
its 
example 
and 
in 
time 
the 
three 
hundred 
men, 
who 
today 
govern 
German 
economically, 
will 
gradually 
be 
reduced 
to 
fifty, 
twenty-five 
or 
still 
fewer. 
It 
cannot 
be 
expected 
that 
this 
new 
move 
towards 
concentration 
will 
be 
confined 
to 
banking. 
The 
close 
relations 
that 
exist 
between 
certain 
banks 
naturally 
involve 
the 
bringing 
together 
of 
the 
manufacturing 
combines 
which 
they 
patronize.... 
One 
fine 
morning 
we 
shall 
wake 
up 
in 
surprise 
to 
see 
nothing 
but 
trusts 
before 
our 
eyes, 
and 
to 
find 



ourselves 
faced 
with 
the 
necessity 
of 
substituting 
state 
monopolies 
for 
private 
monopolies. 
However, 
we 
have 
nothing 
to 
reproach 
ourselves 
with, 
except 
with 
having 
allowed 
things 
to 
follow 
their 
own 
course, 
slightly 
accelerated 
by 
the 
manipulation 
of 
stocks.” 


This 
is 
a 
very 
good 
example 
of 
the 
impotence 
of 
bourgeois 
journalism 
which 
differs 
from 
bourgeois 
science 
only 
in 
that 
the 
latter 
is 
less 
sincere 
and 
strives 
to 
obscure 
essential 
things, 
to 
conceal 
the 
wood 
by 
trees. 
To 
be 
“surprised” 
at 
the 
results 
of 
concentration, 
to 
“reproach” 
the 
government 
of 
capitalist 
Germany, 
or 
capitalist 
society 
(“ourselves”), 
to 
fear 
that 
the 
introduction 
of 
stocks 
and 
shares 
might 
“hasten” 
concentration, 
as 
the 
German 
“cartel 
specialist” 
Tschierschky 
fears 
the 
American 
trusts 
and 
“prefers” 
the 
German 
cartels 
on 
the 
grounds 
that 
they 
do 
not, 
“like 
the 
trusts, 
hasten 
technical 
economic 
progress 
to 
an 
excessive 
degree”—is 
not 
this 
impotence? 


But 
facts 
remain 
facts. 
There 
are 
no 
trusts 
in 
Germany; 
there 
are 
“only” 
cartels—but 
Germany 
is 
governed 
by 
not 
more 
than 
three 
hundred 
magnates, 
and 
the 
number 
of 
these 
is 
constantly 
diminishing. 
At 
all 
events, 
banks 
in 
all 
capitalist 
countries, 
no 
matter 
what 
the 
law 
in 
regard 
to 
them 
may 
be, 
accelerate 
the 
process 
of 
concentration 
of 
capital 
and 
the 
formation 
of 
monopolies. 


The 
banking 
system, 
Marx 
wrote 
a 
half 
century 
ago 
in 
Capital, 
“presents 
indeed 
the 
form 
of 
universal 
bookkeeping 
and 
of 
distribution 
of 
means 
of 
production 
on 
a 
social 
scale, 
but 
only 
the 
form.” 


The 
figures 
we 
have 
quoted 
on 
the 
development 
of 
bank 
capital, 
on 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
number 
of 
branches 
and 
offices 
of 
the 
biggest 
banks, 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
number 
of 
their 
accounts, 
etc., 
present 
a 
concrete 
picture 
of 
this 
“universal 
bookkeeping” 
of 
the 
whole 
capitalist 
class; 
and 
not 
only 
of 
the 
capitalists, 
for 
the 
banks 
collect, 
even 
though 
temporarily, 
all 
kinds 
of 
financial 
revenues 
of 
small 
businessmen, 
office 
clerks, 
and 
of 
a 
small 
upper 
stratum 
of 
the 
working 
class. 
It 
is 
“universal 
distribution 
of 
means 
of 
production” 
that, 
from 
the 
formal 
point 
of 
view, 
grows 
out 
of 
the 
development 
of 
modern 
banks, 
the 
most 
important 
of 
which, 
numbering 
from 
three 
to 
six 
in 
France, 
and 
from 
six 
to 
eight 
in 
Germany, 
control 
billions 
and 
billions. 
In 
point 
of 
fact, 
however, 
the 
distribution 
of 
means 
of 
production 
is 
by 
no 
means 
“universal,” 
but 
private, 
i.e., 
it 
conforms 
to 
the 
interests 
of 
big 
capital, 
and 
primarily 
of 
very 
big 
monopoly 
capital, 
which 
operates 
in 
conditions 
in 
which 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
population 
live 
in 
want, 
in 
which 
the 



whole 
development 
of 
agriculture 
hopelessly 
lags 
behind 
the 
development 
of 
industry, 
and 
within 
industry 
itself, 
the 
“heavy 
industries” 
exact 
tribute 
from 
all 
other 
branches 
of 
industry. 


The 
savings 
banks 
and 
post 
offices 
are 
beginning 
to 
compete 
with 
the 
banks 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
socializing 
capitalist 
economy; 
they 
are 
more 
“decentralized,” 
i.e., 
their 
influence 
extends 
to 
a 
greater 
number 
of 
localities, 
to 
more 
remote 
places, 
to 
wider 
sections 
of 
the 
population. 
An 
American 
commission 
has 
collected 
the 
following 
data 
on 
the 
comparative 
growth 
of 
deposits 
in 
banks 
and 
savings 
banks: 


DEPOSITS 
(IN 
BILLIONS 
OF 
MARKS) 


As 
they 
pay 
interest 
at 
the 
rate 
of 
4 
per 
cent 
and 
4½ 
per 
cent 
on 
deposits, 
the 
savings 
banks 
must 
seek 
“profitable” 
investments 
for 
their 
capital, 
they 
must 
deal 
in 
bills, 
mortgages, 
etc. 
Thus, 
the 
boundaries 
between 
the 
banks 
and 
the 
savings 
banks 
“become 
more 
and 
more 
obliterated.” 
The 
Chambers 
of 
Commerce 
at 
Bochum 
and 
Erfurt, 
for 
example, 
demand 
that 
savings 
banks 
be 
prohibited 
from 
engaging 
in 
“purely” 
banking 
business, 
such 
as 
discounting 
bills. 
They 
also 
demand 
the 
limitation 
of 
the 
“banking” 
operations 
of 
the 
post 
office. 
The 
banking 
magnates 
seem 
to 
be 
afraid 
that 
state 
monopoly 
will 
steal 
upon 
them 
from 
an 
unexpected 
quarter. 
It 
goes 
without 
saying, 
however, 
that 
this 
fear 
is 
no 
more 
than 
the 
expression, 
as 
it 
were, 
of 
the 
rivalry 
between 
two 
department 
managers 
in 
the 
same 
office; 
for, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
the 
billions 
entrusted 
to 
the 
savings 
banks 
are 
actually 
controlled 
by 
these 
very 
same 
bank 
magnates, 
while, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
state 
monopoly 
in 
capitalist 
society 
is 
nothing 
more 
than 
a 
means 
of 
increasing 
and 
guaranteeing 
the 
income 
of 
millionaires 
on 
the 
verge 
of 
bankruptcy 
in 
one 
branch 
of 
industry 
or 
another. 


The 
change 
from 
the 
old 
type 
of 
capitalism, 
in 
which 
free 
competition 
predominated, 
to 
the 
new 
capitalism, 
in 
which 
monopoly 
reigns, 
is 
expressed, 
among 
other 
things, 
by 
a 
decrease 
in 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
Stock 
Exchange. 
The 
German 
review, 
Die 
Bank, 
wrote: 


“For 
a 
long 
time 
now, 
the 
Stock 
Exchange 
has 
ceased 
to 
be 
the 
indispensable 
intermediary 
of 
circulation 
that 
it 
was 
formerly 
when 
the 
banks 
were 
not 
yet 
able 
to 
place 
with 
their 
clients 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
their 
issues.” 


“Every 
bank 
is 
a 
Stock 
Exchange—and 
the 
bigger 
the 
bank, 
and 
the 
more 
successful 
the 
concentration 
of 
banking 
is, 
the 
truer 
does 
this 
modern 
proverb 
become.” 


“While 
formerly, 
in 
the 
‘seventies, 
the 
Stock 
Exchange, 
flushed 
with 
the 



exuberance 
of 
youth” 
(a 
delicate 
allusion 
to 
the 
crash 
of 
1873, 
and 
to 
the 
stock 
flotation 
scandals), 
“opened 
the 
era 
of 
the 
industrialization 
of 
Germany 
by 
utilizing 
the 
gambling 
chance 
that 
lies 
in 
stocks, 
nowadays 
the 
banks 
and 
industry 
are 
able 
to 
‘do 
it 
alone.’ 
The 
domination 
of 
our 
big 
banks 
over 
the 
Stock 
Exchange 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
expression 
of 
the 
completely 
organized 
German 
industrial 
state. 
If 
the 
domain 
of 
the 
automatically 
functioning 
economic 
laws 
is 
thus 
restricted, 
and 
if 
the 
domain 
consciously 
regulated 
by 
the 
banks 
is 
considerably 
increased, 
the 
national 
economic 
responsibility 
of 
a 
very 
small 
number 
of 
guiding 
heads 
is 
infinitely 
increased,” 
wrote 
Professor 
Schulze-Gävernitz, 
an 
apologist 
of 
German 
imperialism, 
who 
is 
regarded 
as 
an 
authority 
by 
the 
imperialists 
of 
all 
countries, 
and 
who 
tries 
to 
gloss 
over 
a 
“detail,” 
viz., 
that 
the 
“conscious 
regulation” 
of 
economic 
life 
by 
the 
banks 
is 
robbery 
of 
the 
public 
by 
a 
handful 
of 
“completely 
organized” 
monopolists. 
For 
the 
task 
of 
a 
bourgeois 
professor 
is 
not 
to 
lay 
bare 
the 
mechanisms 
of 
the 
financial 
system, 
or 
to 
divulge 
all 
the 
machinations 
of 
the 
finance 
monopolists, 
but 
rather, 
to 
present 
them 
in 
a 
favorable 
light. 


In 
the 
same 
way, 
Riesser, 
a 
still 
more 
authoritative 
economist 
and 
a 
banker 
himself, 
makes 
shift 
with 
meaningless 
phrases 
in 
order 
to 
explain 
away 
undeniable 
facts. 
He 
says: 


“The 
Stock 
Exchange 
is 
steadily 
losing 
the 
feature 
which 
is 
absolutely 
essential 
for 
commerce 
and 
industry 
as 
a 
whole 
and 
for 
the 
circulation 
of 
securities 
in 
particular—that 
of 
being 
an 
exact 
measuring-rod 
and 
an 
almost 
automatic 
regulator 
of 
the 
economic 
movements 
which 
converge 
on 
it.” 


In 
other 
words, 
the 
old 
capitalism, 
the 
capitalism 
of 
free 
competition, 
and 
its 
indispensable 
regulator, 
the 
Stock 
Exchange, 
are 
passing 
away. 
A 
new 
capitalism 
is 
succeeding 
it, 
which 
bears 
obvious 
features 
of 
something 
transitory, 
which 
is 
a 
mixture 
of 
free 
competition 
and 
monopoly. 
The 
question 
naturally 
arises: 
to 
what 
is 
this 
new, 
“transitory” 
capitalism 
leading? 
But 
the 
bourgeois 
scholars 
are 
afraid 
to 
raise 
this 
question. 


“Thirty 
years 
ago, 
employers, 
freely 
competing 
against 
one 
another, 
performed 
nine-tenths 
of 
the 
economic 
work 
which 
is 
outside 
the 
sphere 
of 
manual 
labor. 
At 
the 
present 
time, 
nine-tenths 
of 
this 
economic 
‘brain 
work’ 
is 
performed 
by 
officials. 
Banking 
is 
in 
the 
forefront 
of 
this 
evolution.” 


This 
admission 
by 
Schulze-Gävernitz 
brings 
us 
once 
again 
to 
the 
question 
of 
what 
this 
new 
capitalism, 
capitalism 
in 
its 
imperialist 
stage, 
is 
leading 
to. 


Among 
the 
few 
banks 
which, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
process 
of 
concentration, 
remain 
at 
the 
head 
of 
all 
capitalist 
economy, 
there 
is 
naturally 
to 
be 
observed 



an 
increasingly 
marked 
tendency 
towards 
monopolist 
agreements, 
towards 
a 
bank 
trust. 
In 
America, 
there 
are 
not 
nine, 
but 
two 
big 
banks, 
those 
of 
the 
billionaires 
Rockefeller 
and 
Morgan, 
which 
control 
a 
capital 
of 
eleven 
billion 
marks. 
In 
Germany, 
the 
absorption 
of 
the 
Schaffhausenschen 
Bankverein 
by 
the 
Disconto-Gesellschaft, 
to 
which 
we 
referred 
above, 
was 
commented 
on 
in 
the 
following 
terms 
by 
the 
Frankfurter 
Zeitung, 
one 
of 
the 
organs 
of 
the 
Stock 
Exchange 
interests: 


“The 
concentration 
movement 
of 
the 
banks 
is 
narrowing 
the 
circle 
of 
establishments 
from 
which 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
obtain 
large 
credits, 
and 
consequently 
is 
increasing 
the 
dependence 
of 
large-scale 
industry 
upon 
a 
small 
number 
of 
banking 
groups. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
internal 
links 
between 
industry 
and 
finance, 
the 
freedom 
of 
movement 
of 
manufacturing 
companies 
in 
need 
of 
bank 
capital 
is 
restricted. 
For 
this 
reason, 
large-scale 
industry 
is 
watching 
the 
growing 
trustification 
of 
the 
banks 
with 
mixed 
feelings. 
Indeed, 
we 
have 
repeatedly 
seen 
the 
beginnings 
of 
certain 
agreements 
between 
the 
individual 
big 
banking 
concerns, 
which 
aim 
at 
limiting 
competition.” 


Again, 
the 
final 
word 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
banks 
is 
monopoly. 


The 
close 
ties 
that 
exist 
between 
the 
banks 
and 
industry 
are 
the 
very 
things 
that 
bring 
out 
most 
strikingly 
the 
new 
role 
of 
the 
banks. 
When 
a 
bank 
discounts 
a 
bill 
for 
an 
industrial 
firm, 
opens 
a 
current 
account 
for 
it, 
etc., 
these 
operations, 
taken 
separately, 
do 
not 
in 
the 
least 
diminish 
the 
independence 
of 
the 
industrial 
firm, 
and 
the 
bank 
plays 
no 
other 
part 
than 
that 
of 
a 
modest 
intermediary. 
But 
when 
such 
operations 
are 
multiplied 
and 
become 
continuous, 
when 
the 
bank 
“collects” 
in 
its 
own 
hands 
enormous 
amounts 
of 
capital, 
when 
the 
running 
of 
a 
current 
account 
for 
the 
firm 
in 
question 
enables 
the 
bank 
—and 
this 
is 
what 
happens—to 
become 
better 
informed 
of 
the 
economic 
position 
of 
the 
client, 
then 
the 
result 
is 
that 
industrial 
capital 
becomes 
more 
completely 
dependent 
on 
the 
bank. 


Parallel 
to 
this 
process 
there 
is 
being 
developed 
a 
very 
close 
personal 
union 
between 
the 
banks 
and 
the 
biggest 
industrial’ 
and 
commercial 
enterprises, 
the 
fusing 
of 
one 
with 
the 
other 
through 
the 
acquisition 
of 
shares, 
through 
the 
appointment 
of 
bank 
directors 
to 
the 
boards 
of 
industrial 
and 
commercial 
enterprises 
and 
vice 
versa. 


The 
German 
economist, 
Jeidels, 
has 
compiled 
very 
complete 
data 
on 
this 
form 
of 
concentration 
of 
capital 
and 
of 
enterprises. 
Six 
of 
the 
biggest 
Berlin 
banks 
were 
represented 
by 
their 
directors 
in 
344 
industrial 
companies, 
and 
by 
their 
board 
members 
in 
407 
other 
companies. 
Altogether, 
they 
supervised 
a 



total 
of 
751 
companies. 
In 
289 
of 
these 
companies 
they 
either 
had 
two 
of 
their 
representatives 
on 
each 
of 
the 
respective 
Supervisory 
Boards, 
or 
held 
the 
posts 
of 
presidents. 
These 
industrial 
and 
commercial 
companies 
are 
engaged 
in 
the 
most 
varied 
branches 
of 
industry: 
in 
insurance, 
transport, 
restaurants, 
theatres, 
art 
industry, 
etc. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
there 
were 
on 
the 
Supervisory 
Boards 
of 
the 
six 
banks 
(in 
1910) 
fifty-one 
of 
the 
biggest 
manufacturers, 
among 
whom 
were 
the 
directors 
of 
Krupp, 
of 
the 
powerful 
Hamburg-Amerika 
Line, 
etc. 
From 
1895 
to 
1910, 
each 
of 
these 
six 
banks 
participated 
in 
the 
share 
issues 
of 
several 
hundreds 
of 
industrial 
companies 
(the 
number 
ranging 
from 
281 
to 
419). 


The 
“personal 
union” 
between 
the 
banks 
and 
industry 
is 
completed 
by 
the 
“personal 
union” 
between 
both 
and 
the 
state. 


“Seats 
on 
the 
Supervisory 
Board 
are 
freely 
offered 
to 
persons 
of 
title, 
also 
to 
ex-civil 
servants, 
who 
are 
able 
to 
do 
a 
great 
deal 
to 
facilitate” 
(!!) 
“relations 
with 
the 
authorities.” 


Generally 
there 
is 
“a 
member 
of 
parliament 
or 
a 
Berlin 
city 
councillor” 
on 
the 
Supervisory 
Board 
of 
a 
big 
bank. 
The 
building, 
so 
to 
speak, 
of 
the 
great 
capitalist 
monopolies, 
is, 
therefore, 
going 
full 
steam 
ahead 
by 
all 
“natural” 
and 
“supernatural” 
ways. 
A 
sort 
of 
division 
of 
labor 
among 
some 
hundreds 
of 
kings 
of 
finance 
who 
now 
reign 
over 
modern 
capitalist 
society 
is 
being 
systematically 
developed. 


“Accompanying 
this 
widening 
of 
the 
sphere 
of 
activity 
of 
certain 
big 
industrialists” 
(sharing 
in 
the 
management 
of 
banks, 
etc.) 
“and 
together 
with 
the 
allocation 
of 
provincial 
managers 
to 
definite 
industrial 
regions, 
there 
is 
a 
growth 
of 
specialization 
among 
the 
directors 
of 
the 
great 
banks. 
Generally 
speaking, 
this 
specialization 
is 
only 
conceivable 
when 
banking 
is 
carried 
on 
on 
a 
large 
scale, 
and 
particularly 
when 
it 
has 
widespread 
connections 
with 
industry. 
This 
division 
of 
labor 
proceeds 
along 
two 
lines: 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
the 
relations 
with 
industry 
as 
a 
whole 
are 
entrusted 
to 
one 
manager, 
as 
his 
special 
function; 
on 
the 
other, 
each 
director 
assumes 
the 
supervision 
of 
several 
isolated 
enterprises 
or 
enterprises 
with 
allied 
interests 
or 
in 
the 
same 
branch 
of 
industry, 
sitting 
on 
their 
Boards 
of 
Directors” 
(capitalism 
has 
reached 
the 
stage 
of 
organized 
control 
of 
individual 
enterprises). 
“One 
specializes 
in 
German 
industry, 
sometimes 
even 
in 
West 
German 
industry, 
alone” 
(the 
West 
is 
the 
most 
industrialized 
part 
of 
Germany). 
“Others 
specialize 
in 
relations 
with 
foreign 
states 
and 
foreign 
industry, 
in 
information 
about 
personal 
data, 
in 
Stock 
Exchange 
questions, 
etc. 
Besides, 
each 
bank 
director 



is 
often 
assigned 
a 
special 
industry 
or 
locality, 
where 
he 
has 
a 
say 
on 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors; 
one 
works 
mainly 
on 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors 
of 
electric 
companies, 
another 
in 
the 
chemical, 
brewing 
or 
sugar 
beet 
industry; 
a 
third 
in 
several 
isolated 
undertakings, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
in 
non-industrial, 
even 
insurance 
companies.... 
It 
is 
certain 
that, 
as 
the 
extent 
and 
diversification 
of 
the 
big 
banks’ 
operations 
increase, 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
among 
their 
directors 
also 
spreads, 
with 
the 
object 
and 
result 
of 
lifting 
them 
somewhat 
out 
of 
pure 
banking 
and 
making 
them 
better 
experts, 
better 
judges 
of 
the 
general 
problems 
of 
industry 
and 
the 
special 
problems 
of 
each 
branch 
of 
industry, 
thus 
making 
them 
more 
capable 
of 
action 
within 
the 
respective 
bank’s 
industrial 
sphere 
of 
influence. 
This 
system 
is 
supplemented 
by 
the 
banks’ 
endeavors 
to 
have 
elected 
to 
their 
own 
Board 
of 
Directors, 
or 
to 
those 
of 
their 
subsidiary 
banks, 
men 
who 
are 
experts 
in 
industrial 
affairs, 
such 
as 
industrialists, 
former 
officials, 
especially 
those 
formerly 
in 
railway 
service 
or 
in 
mining, 
etc.” 


We 
find 
the 
same 
system, 
with 
only 
slight 
difference, 
in 
French 
banking. 
For 
instance, 
one 
of 
the 
three 
largest 
French 
banks, 
the 
Credit 
Lyonnais, 
has 
organized 
a 
financial 
research 
service 
(Service 
des 
Etudes 
Financières), 
which 
permanently 
employs 
about 
fifty 
engineers, 
statisticians, 
economists, 
lawyers, 
etc., 
at 
a 
cost 
of 
six 
or 
seven 
hundred 
thousand 
francs 
per 
annum. 
The 
service 
is 
in 
turn 
divided 
into 
eight 
sections, 
of 
which 
one 
deals 
with 
industrial 
establishments, 
another 
with 
general 
statistics, 
a 
third 
with 
railway 
and 
steamship 
companies, 
a 
fourth 
with 
securities, 
a 
fifth 
with 
financial 
reports, 
etc. 


The 
result 
is 
twofold: 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
a 
fusion, 
or, 
as 
N. 
Bukharin 
aptly 
calls 
it, 
the 
merging 
of 
bank 
and 
industrial 
capital; 
and, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
a 
transformation 
of 
the 
banks 
into 
institutions 
of 
a 
truly 
“universal 
character.” 
On 
this 
question 
we 
consider 
it 
important 
to 
quote 
the 
exact 
terms 
used 
by 
Jeidels, 
who 
has 
best 
studied 
the 
subject: 


“An 
examination 
of 
the 
sum 
total 
of 
industrial 
relationships 
reveals 
the 
universal 
character 
of 
the 
financial 
establishments 
working 
on 
behalf 
of 
industry. 
Unlike 
other 
kinds 
of 
banks 
and 
contrary 
to 
the 
requirements 
often 
laid 
down 
in 
literature—according 
to 
which 
banks 
ought 
to 
specialize 
in 
one 
kind 
of 
business 
or 
in 
one 
branch 
of 
industry 
in 
order 
to 
maintain 
a 
firm 
footing—the 
big 
banks 
are 
striving 
to 
make 
their 
industrial 
connections 
as 
varied 
and 
far-reaching 
as 
possible, 
according 
to 
locality 
and 
branch 
of 
business, 
and 
are 
striving 
to 
do 
away 
with 
the 
inequalities 
in 
the 
local 
and 



business 
distribution 
resulting 
from 
the 
development 
of 
various 
enterprises.... 
One 
tendency 
is 
to 
make 
the 
ties 
with 
industry 
general; 
the 
other 
tendency 
is 
to 
make 
these 
ties 
durable 
and 
close. 
In 
the 
six 
big 
banks 
both 
these 
tendencies 
are 
realized, 
not 
in 
full, 
but 
to 
a 
considerable 
extent 
and 
to 
an 
equal 
degree.” 


Quite 
often 
industrial 
and 
commercial 
circles 
complain 
of 
the 
“terrorism” 
of 
the 
banks. 
We 
are 
not 
surprised, 
for 
the 
big 
banks 
“command,” 
as 
will 
be 
seen 
from 
the 
following 
example: 
on 
November 
19, 
1901, 
one 
of 
the 
big 
Berlin 
“D” 
banks 
(such 
is 
the 
name 
given 
to 
the 
four 
biggest 
banks 
whose 
names 
begin 
with 
the 
letter 
D) 
wrote 
to 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors 
of 
the 
German 
Central 
Northwest 
Cement 
Syndicate 
in 
the 
following 
terms: 


“We 
learn, 
from 
the 
notice 
you 
published 
in 
the 
Reichsanzeiger 
of 
18th 
instant, 
that 
the 
next 
general 
meeting 
of 
your 
company, 
fixed 
for 
the 
30th 
of 
this 
month, 
may 
decide 
on 
measures 
which 
are 
likely 
to 
effect 
changes 
in 
your 
undertakings 
which 
we 
cannot 
sanction. 
We 
deeply 
regret 
that, 
for 
these 
reasons, 
we 
are 
obliged 
henceforth 
to 
withdraw 
the 
credit 
which 
has 
been 
hitherto 
allowed 
you. 
If 
the 
said 
next 
general 
meeting 
does 
not 
decide 
upon 
measures 
we 
cannot 
sanction, 
and 
if 
we 
receive 
suitable 
guarantees 
on 
this 
matter 
for 
the 
future, 
we 
shall 
be 
quite 
willing 
to 
open 
negotiations 
with 
you 
on 
the 
opening 
of 
a 
new 
credit.” 


As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
this 
is 
small 
capital’s 
old 
complaint 
about 
being 
oppressed 
by 
big 
capital, 
but 
in 
this 
case 
it 
was 
a 
whole 
syndicate 
that 
fell 
into 
the 
category 
of 
“small” 
capitall 
The 
old 
struggle 
between 
big 
and 
small 
capital 
is 
being 
resumed 
on 
a 
new 
and 
higher 
stage 
of 
development. 
It 
stands 
to 
reason 
that 
undertakings, 
financed 
by 
big 
banks 
handling 
billions, 
can 
accelerate 
technical 
progress 
in 
a 
way 
that 
cannot 
possibly 
be 
compared 
with 
the 
past. 
The 
banks, 
for 
example, 
set 
up 
special 
technical 
research 
societies, 
and 
only 
“friendly” 
industrial 
enterprises 
benefit 
from 
their 
work. 
To 
this 
category 
belong 
the 
Electric 
Railway 
Research 
Association 
and 
the 
Central 
Bureau 
of 
Scientific 
and 
Technical 
Research. 


The 
directors 
of 
the 
big 
banks 
themselves 
cannot 
fail 
to 
see 
that 
new 
conditions 
of 
economic 
life 
are 
being 
created. 
But 
they 
are 
powerless 
in 
the 
face 
of 
these 
phenomena. 


“Anyone 
who 
has 
watched, 
in 
recent 
years, 
the 
changes 
of 
incumbents 
of 
directorships 
and 
seats 
on 
the 
Boards 
of 
Directors 
of 
the 
big 
banks 
cannot 
fail 
to 
have 
noticed 
that 
power 
is 
gradually 
passing 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
men 
who 
consider 
the 
active 
intervention 
of 
the 
big 
banks 
in 
the 
general 
development 



of 
production 
to 
be 
indispensable 
and 
of 
increasing 
importance. 
It 
often 
happens 
that, 
between 
these 
new 
men 
and 
the 
old 
bank 
directors, 
disagreements 
of 
a 
business 
and 
personal 
nature 
often 
occur 
on 
this 
subject. 
The 
question 
that 
is 
in 
dispute 
is 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
banks, 
as 
credit 
institutions, 
will 
suffer 
from 
his 
intervention 
in 
industry, 
whether 
they 
are 
sacrificing 
tried 
principles 
and 
an 
assured 
profit 
to 
engage 
in 
a 
field 
of 
activity 
which 
has 
nothing 
in 
common 
with 
their 
role 
as 
intermediaries 
in 
providing 
credit 
and 
which 
is 
leading 
the 
banks 
into 
a 
field 
where 
they 
are 
more 
than 
ever 
before 
exposed 
to 
the 
blind 
forces 
of 
trade 
fluctuations. 
This 
is 
the 
opinion 
of 
many 
of 
the 
older 
bank 
directors, 
while 
most 
of 
the 
young 
men 
consider 
active 
intervention 
in 
industry 
to 
be 
a 
necessity 
as 
great 
as 
that 
which 
gave 
rise, 
simultaneously 
with 
big 
modern 
industry, 
to 
the 
big 
banks 
and 
modern 
industrial 
banking. 
The 
two 
parties 
to 
this 
discussion 
are 
agreed 
only 
on 
one 
point 
and 
that 
is, 
that 
as 
yet 
there 
are 
neither 
firm 
principles 
nor 
a 
concrete 
aim 
in 
the 
new 
activities 
of 
the 
big 
banks.” 


The 
old 
form 
of 
capitalism 
has 
had 
its 
day. 
The 
new 
form 
represents 
a 
transition 
towards 
something. 
It 
is 
hopeless, 
of 
course, 
to 
seek 
for 
“firm 
principles” 
and 
a 
“concrete 
aim” 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
“reconciling” 
monopoly 
with 
free 
competition. 
The 
admission 
of 
the 
practical 
men 
has 
quite 
a 
different 
ring 
from 
the 
official 
praises 
of 
the 
charms 
of 
“organized” 
capitalism 
sung 
by 
its 
apologists, 
Schulze-Gävernitz, 
Liefmann 
and 
similar 
“theoreticians.” 


At 
precisely 
what 
period 
was 
the 
“new 
activity” 
of 
the 
big 
banks 
finally 
established? 
Jeidels 
gives 
us 
a 
fairly 
exact 
answer 
to 
this 
important 
question: 


“The 
ties 
between 
the 
industrial 
enterprises, 
with 
their 
new 
content, 
their 
new 
forms 
and 
their 
new 
organs, 
namely, 
the 
big 
banks 
which 
are 
organized 
on 
both 
a 
centralized 
and 
a 
decentralized 
basis, 
were 
scarcely 
a 
characteristic 
economic 
phenomenon 
before 
1890; 
in 
one 
sense, 
indeed, 
this 
initial 
date 
may 
be 
advanced 
to 
the 
year 
1897, 
when 
the 
important 
‘mergers’ 
took 
place 
and 
when, 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
the 
new 
form 
of 
decentralized 
organization 
was 
introduced 
to 
suit 
the 
industrial 
policy 
of 
the 
banks. 
This 
starting 
point 
could 
perhaps 
be 
placed 
at 
an 
even 
later 
date, 
for 
it 
was 
only 
the 
crisis” 
(of 
1900) 
“that 
enormously 
accelerated 
and 
intensified 
the 
process 
of 
concentration 
of 
industry 
and 
banking, 
consolidated 
that 
process 
and 
more 
than 
ever 
transformed 
the 
connection 
with 
industry 
into 
the 
monopoly 
of 
the 
big 
banks, 
and 
made 
this 
connection, 
taken 
individually, 
much 
closer 
and 
more 
active.” 


Thus, 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century 
marks 
the 
turning 
point 
at 



which 
the 
old 
capitalism 
gave 
way 
to 
the 
new, 
at 
which 
the 
domination 
of 
capital 
in 
general 
made 
way 
for 
the 
domination 
of 
finance 
capital. 



Chapter 
Iii 


Finance 
Capital 
And 
Financial 
Oligarchy 


“AN 
increasing 
proportion 
of 
industrial 
capital 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
industrialists 
who 
employ 
it. 
They 
obtain 
the 
use 
of 
it 
only 
through 
the 
medium 
of 
the 
banks, 
which, 
in 
relation 
to 
them, 
represent 
the 
owners 
of 
the 
capital. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
bank 
is 
forced 
to 
put 
an 
increasing 
share 
of 
its 
funds 
into 
industry. 
Thus, 
to 
an 
increasing 
degree 
the 
banker 
is 
being 
transformed 
into 
an 
industrial 
capitalist. 
This 
bank 
capital, 
i.e., 
capital 
in 
money 
form 
which 
is 
thus 
really 
transformed 
into 
industrial 
capital, 
I 
call 
‘finance 
capital.’ 
... 
So 
finance 
capital 
is 
capital 
controlled 
by 
the 
banks 
and 
employed 
by 
the 
industrialists.” 


This 
definition 
is 
incomplete 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
silent 
on 
one 
extremely 
important 
fact: 
the 
increase 
of 
concentration 
of 
production 
and 
of 
capital 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that 
it 
leads, 
and 
has 
led, 
to 
monopoly. 
But 
throughout 
the 
whole 
of 
his 
work, 
and 
particularly 
in 
the 
two 
chapters 
which 
precede 
the 
one 
from 
which 
this 
definition 
is 
taken, 
Hilferding 
stresses 
the 
part 
played 
by 
capitalist 
monopolies. 


The 
concentration 
of 
production; 
the 
monopoly 
arising 
therefrom; 
the 
merging 
or 
coalescence 
of 
banking 
with 
industry: 
this 
is 
the 
history 
of 
finance 
capital 
and 
what 
gives 
the 
term 
“finance 
capital” 
its 
content. 


We 
now 
have 
to 
describe 
how, 
under 
commodity 
production 
and 
private 
property, 
the 
“domination” 
of 
capitalist 
monopolies 
inevitably 
becomes 
the 
domination 
of 
a 
financial 
oligarchy. 
It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
the 
representatives 
of 
German 
bourgeois 
science—and 
not 
only 
of 
German 
science—like 
Riesser, 
Schulze-Gävernitz, 
Liefmann 
and 
others—are 
all 
apologists 
for 
imperialism 
and 
for 
finance 
capital. 
Instead 
of 
revealing 
the 
“mechanics” 
of 
the 
formation 
of 
an 
oligarchy, 
its 
methods, 
its 
revenues 
“innocent 
and 
sinful,” 
its 
connections 
with 
parliament, 
etc., 
they 
conceal, 
obscure 
and 
embellish 
them. 
They 
evade 
these 
“vexed 
questions” 
by 
a 
few 
vague 
and 
pompous 
phrases: 
appeals 
to 
the 
“sense 
of 
responsibility” 
of 
bank 
directors, 
praising 
“the 
sense 
of 
duty” 
of 
Prussian 
officials; 
by 
giving 
serious 
study 
to 
petty 
details, 
to 
ridiculous 
bills 
for 
the 
“supervision” 
and 
“regulation” 
of 
monopolies; 
by 
playing 
with 
theories, 
like, 
for 
example, 
the 
following 
“scientific” 
definition, 
arrived 
at 
by 
Professor 
Liefmann. 



“Commerce 
is 
a 
gainful 
occupation 
carried 
on 
by 
collecting 
goods, 
storing 
it 
and 
making 
it 
available.” 
(The 
professor’s 
italics.) 
From 
this 
it 
would 
follow 
that 
primitive 
man, 
who 
knew 
nothing 
about 
exchange, 
was 
a 
trader, 
and 
that 
commerce 
will 
exist 
under 
socialism! 


But 
the 
monstrous 
facts 
concerning 
the 
monstrous 
rule 
of 
the 
financial 
oligarchy 
are 
so 
striking 
that 
in 
all 
capitalist 
countries, 
in 
America, 
France 
and 
Germany, 
a 
whole 
literature 
has 
sprung 
up, 
written 
from 
the 
bourgeois 
point 
of 
view, 
but 
which, 
nevertheless, 
gives 
a 
fairly 
accurate 
picture 
and 
criticism—petty—bourgeois, 
naturally—of 
this 
oligarchy. 


The 
“holding 
system,” 
to 
which 
we 
have 
already 
briefly 
referred 
above, 
should 
be 
placed 
at 
the 
corner-stone. 
The 
German 
economist, 
Heymann, 
probably 
the 
first 
to 
call 
attention 
to 
this 
matter, 
describes 
it 
in 
this 
way: 


“The 
executive 
director 
controls 
the 
parent 
company; 
the 
latter 
reigns 
over 
the 
subsidiary 
companies 
which 
similarly 
control 
still 
other 
subsidiaries.” 


Thus, 
it 
is 
possible 
with 
a 
comparatively 
small 
capital 
to 
dominate 
immense 
spheres 
of 
production. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
if 
holding 
50 
per 
cent 
of 
the 
capital 
is 
always 
sufficient 
to 
control 
a 
company, 
the 
executive 
director 
needs 
only 
one 
million 
to 
control 
eight 
millions 
in 
the 
second 
subsidiaries. 
And 
if 
this 
“interlocking” 
is 
extended, 
it 
is 
possible 
with 
one 
million 
to 
control 
sixteen, 
thirty-two 
or 
more 
millions. 


Experience 
shows 
that 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
own 
40 
per 
cent 
of 
the 
shares 
of 
a 
company 
in 
order 
to 
direct 
its 
affairs, 
since 
a 
certain 
number 
of 
small 
shareholders 
find 
it 
impossible, 
in 
practice, 
to 
attend 
general 
meetings, 
etc. 
The 
“democratization” 
of 
the 
ownership 
of 
shares, 
from 
which 
the 
bourgeois 
sophists 
and 
opportunists 
“would-be” 
Social-Democrats 
expect 
(or 
declare 
that 
they 
expect) 
the 
“democratization” 
of 
capital, 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
role 
of 
small-scale 
production, 
etc., 
is 
in 
fact 
one 
of 
the 
ways 
of 
increasing 
the 
power 
of 
the 
financial 
oligarchy. 
For 
this 
reason, 
among 
others, 
in 
the 
more 
advanced, 
or 
in 
the 
older 
and 
more 
“experienced” 
capitalist 
countries, 
the 
law 
allows 
the 
issue 
of 
shares 
of 
very 
small 
denomination. 
In 
Germany, 
it 
is 
illegal 
to 
issue 
shares 
of 
less 
value 
than 
one 
thousand 
marks, 
and 
the 
magnates 
of 
German 
finance 
look 
with 
an 
envious 
eye 
at 
England, 
where 
it 
is 
legal 
to 
issue 
one 
pound 
shares. 
Siemens, 
one 
of 
the 
biggest 
industrialists 
and 
“financial 
kings” 
in 
Germany, 
told 
the 
Reichstag 
on 
June 
7, 
1900, 
that 
“the 
one 
pound 
share 
is 
the 
basis 
of 
British 
imperialism.” 
This 
merchant 
has 
a 
much 
deeper 
and 
more 
“Marxian” 
understanding 
of 
imperialism 
than 
a 



certain 
disreputable 
writer, 
generally 
held 
to 
be 
one 
of 
the 
founders 
of 
Russian 
Marxism, 
who 
believes 
that 
imperialism 
is 
a 
bad 
habit 
of 
a 
certain 
nation.... 


But 
the 
“holding 
system” 
not 
only 
serves 
to 
increase 
the 
power 
of 
the 
monopolists 
enormously; 
it 
also 
enables 
them 
to 
resort 
with 
impunity 
to 
all 
sorts 
of 
shady 
tricks 
to 
cheat 
the 
public, 
for 
the 
directors 
of 
the 
parent 
company 
are 
not 
legally 
responsible 
for 
the 
subsidiary 
companies, 
which 
are 
supposed 
to 
be 
“independent,” 
and 
through 
the 
medium 
of 
which 
they 
can 
do 
anything. 
Here 
is 
an 
example 
taken 
from 
the 
German 
review, 
Die 
Bank, 
for 
May 
1914: 


“The 
Spring 
Steel 
Corporation 
of 
Kassel 
was 
regarded 
some 
years 
ago 
as 
being 
one 
of 
the 
most 
profitable 
enterprises 
in 
Germany. 
Through 
bad 
management 
its 
dividends 
fell 
within 
the 
space 
of 
a 
few 
years 
from 
15 
per 
cent 
to 
nil. 
It 
appears 
that 
the 
board, 
without 
consulting 
the 
shareholders, 
had 
loaned 
six 
million 
marks 
to 
one 
of 
the 
subsidiary 
companies, 
the 
Hassia, 
Ltd., 
which 
had 
a 
nominal 
capital 
of 
only 
some 
hundreds 
of 
thousands 
of 
marks. 
This 
commitment, 
amounting 
to 
nearly 
treble 
the 
capital 
of 
the 
parent 
company, 
was 
never 
mentioned 
in 
its 
balance 
sheets. 
This 
omission 
was 
quite 
legal, 
and 
could 
be 
kept 
up 
for 
two 
whole 
years 
because 
it 
did 
not 
violate 
any 
provisions 
of 
company 
law. 
The 
chairman 
of 
the 
Supervisory 
Board, 
who 
as 
the 
responsible 
head 
signed 
the 
false 
balance 
sheets, 
was 
and 
still 
is 
the 
president 
of 
the 
Kassel 
Chamber 
of 
Commerce. 
The 
shareholders 
only 
heard 
of 
the 
loan 
to 
the 
Hassia, 
Ltd., 
long 
afterwards, 
when 
it 
had 
long 
been 
proved 
to 
have 
been 
a 
mistake” 
(this 
word 
the 
writer 
should 
have 
put 
in 
quotation 
marks), 
“and 
when 
‘Spring 
Steel’ 
shares 
had 
dropped 
nearly 
100 
points, 
because 
those 
in 
the 
know 
had 
got 
rid 
of 
them.... 


“This 
typical 
example 
of 
balance 
sheet 
jugglery, 
quite 
common 
in 
joint 
stock 
companies, 
explains 
why 
boards 
of 
directors 
are 
more 
willing 
to 
undertake 
risky 
transactions 
than 
individual 
enterprises. 
Modern 
methods 
of 
drawing 
up 
balance 
sheets 
not 
only 
make 
it 
possible 
to 
conceal 
doubtful 
undertakings 
from 
the 
average 
shareholder, 
but 
also 
allow 
the 
people 
most 
concerned 
to 
escape 
the 
consequence 
of 
unsuccessful 
speculation 
by 
selling 
their 
shares 
in 
time 
while 
the 
private 
dealer 
risks 
his 
own 
skin. 


“The 
balance 
sheets 
of 
most 
joint 
stock 
companies 
put 
us 
in 
mind 
of 
the 
palimpsests 
of 
the 
Middle 
Ages 
from 
which 
the 
visible 
inscription 
had 
first 
to 
be 
erased 
in 
order 
to 
discover 
beneath 
another 
inscription 
giving 
the 
real 
meaning 
of 
the 
document.” 
(Palimpsests 
are 
parchment 
documents 
on 
which 



the 
original 
inscription 
was 
obliterated 
and 
another 
inscription 
imposed.) 


“The 
simplest 
and, 
therefore, 
most 
common 
procedure 
for 
making 
balance 
sheets 
indecipherable 
is 
to 
divide 
a 
single 
business 
into 
several 
parts 
by 
setting 
up 
subsidiary 
companies—or 
by 
annexing 
such. 
The 
advantages 
of 
this 
system 
for 
various 
objects—legal 
and 
illegal—are 
so 
evident 
that 
it 
is 
quite 
unusual 
to 
find 
an 
important 
company 
in 
which 
it 
is 
not 
actually 
in 
use.” 


As 
an 
example 
of 
an 
important 
monopolist 
company 
widely 
employing 
this 
system, 
the 
author 
quotes 
the 
famous 
Allgemeine 
Elektrizitäts 
Gesellschaft, 
the 
A.E.G., 
to 
which 
we 
shall 
refer 
later 
on. 
In 
1912, 
it 
was 
calculated 
that 
this 
company 
held 
shares 
in 
from 
175 
to 
200 
other 
companies, 
controlling 
them 
of 
course, 
and 
thus 
having 
control 
of 
a 
total 
capital 
of 
1,500,000,000 
marks! 


All 
rules 
of 
control, 
the 
publication 
of 
balance 
sheets, 
the 
drawing 
up 
of 
balance 
sheets 
according 
to 
a 
definite 
form, 
the 
public 
auditing 
of 
accounts, 
the 
things 
about 
which 
well-intentioned 
professors 
and 
officials—that 
is, 
those 
imbued 
with 
the 
good 
intention 
of 
defending 
and 
embellishing 
capitalism—dis—course 
to 
the 
public, 
are 
of 
no 
avail. 
For 
private 
property 
is 
sacred, 
and 
no 
one 
can 
be 
prohibited 
from 
buying, 
selling, 
exchanging 
or 
mortgaging 
shares, 
etc. 


The 
extent 
to 
which 
this 
“holding 
system” 
has 
developed 
in 
the 
big 
Russian 
banks 
may 
be 
judged 
by 
the 
figures 
given 
by 
E. 
Agahd, 
who 
was 
for 
fifteen 
years 
an 
official 
of 
the 
Russo-Chinese 
Bank 
and 
who, 
in 
May 
1914, 
published 
a 
book, 
not 
altogether 
correctly 
entitled 
Big 
Banks 
and 
the 
World 
Market. 


The 
author 
divides 
the 
great 
Russian 
banks 
into 
two 
main 
categories: 
a) 
those 
which 
operate 
as 
“holding 
banks,” 
and 
b) 
“independent” 
banks 
(the 
independence 
of 
the 
latter 
being 
arbitrarily 
taken 
to 
mean 
being 
independent 
of 
foreign 
banks). 
The 
author 
sub-divides 
the 
first 
group 
into 
three 
subgroups: 
1) 
German 
holding 
banks; 
2) 
British 
and 
3) 
French, 
having 
in 
view 
those 
houses 
in 
whose 
business 
the 
big 
banks 
of 
the 
three 
European 
countries 
mentioned 
hold 
stock 
and 
predominate. 
The 
author 
divides 
the 
capital 
of 
the 
banks 
into 
“productively” 
invested 
capital 
(in 
industrial 
and 
commercial 
undertakings), 
and 
“speculatively” 
invested 
capital 
(in 
Stock 
Exchange 
and 
financial 
operations), 
assuming 
from 
his 
petty-bourgeois 
reformist 
point 
of 
view 
that 
it 
is 
possible, 
under 
capitalism, 
to 
separate 
the 
first 
form 
of 
investment 
from 
the 
second 
and 
to 
abolish 
the 
second 
form. 


Here 
are 
the 
figures 
he 
supplies: 



BANK 
ASSETS 
(According 
to 
reports 
for 
October-November 
1913, 
in 
millions 
of 
rubles) 


According 
to 
these 
figures, 
of 
the 
approximately 
four 
billion 
rubles 
making 
up 
the 
“working” 
capital 
of 
the 
big 
banks, 
more 
than 
three-fourths, 
more 
than 
three 
billion 
belonged 
to 
banks 
which 
in 
reality 
were 
only 
subsidiary 
companies 
of 
foreign 
banks, 
and 
chiefly 
of 
the 
Paris 
banks 
(the 
famous 
trio: 
Union 
Parisien, 
Paris 
et 
Pays-Bas 
and 
Société 
Générale), 
and 
of 
the 
Berlin 
banks 
(particularly 
the 
Deutsche 
Bank 
and 
the 
Disconto-
Gesellschaft). 
Two 
of 
the 
most 
important 
Russian 
banks, 
the 
Russian 
Bank 
for 
Foreign 
Trade 
and 
the 
St. 
Petersburg 
International 
Commercial, 
between 
1906 
and 
1912 
increased 
their 
capital 
from 
44,000,000 
to 
98,000,000 
rubles, 
and 
their 
reserve 
from 
15,000,000 
to 
39,000,000, 
“employing 
three-fourth 
German 
capital.” 
The 
first 
belongs 
to 
the 
Deutsche 
Bank 
group 
and 
the 
second 
to 
the 
Disconto-Gesellschaft. 
The 
worthy 
Agahd 
is 
indignant 
at 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
shares 
are 
held 
by 
German 
banks, 
and 
that, 
therefore, 
the 
Russian 
shareholders 
are 
powerless. 
Naturally, 
the 
country 
which 
exports 
capital 
skims 
the 
cream: 
for 
example, 
the 
Deutsche 
Bank, 
while 
introducing 
the 
shares 
of 
the 
Siberian 
Commercial 
Bank 
on 
the 
Berlin 
market, 
kept 
them 
in 
its 
portfolio 
for 
a 
whole 
year, 
and 
then 
sold 
them 
at 
the 
rate 
of 
193 
for 
100, 
that 
is, 
at 
nearly 
twice 
their 
nominal 
value, 
“earning” 
a 
profit 
of 
nearly 
6,000,000 
rubles, 
which 
Hilferding 
calls 
“promoters’ 
profits.” 


Our 
author 
puts 
the 
total 
resources 
of 
the 
principal 
St. 
Petersburg 
banks 
at 
8,235,000,000 
rubles 
and 
the 
“holdings,” 
or 
rather, 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
foreign 
banks 
dominated 
them, 
he 
estimates 
as 
follows: 
French 
banks, 
55 
per 
cent; 
English, 
10 
per 
cent; 
German, 
35 
per 
cent. 
The 
author 
calculates 
that 
of 
the 
total 
of 
8,235,000,000 
rubles 
of 
functioning 
capital, 
3,687,000,000 
rubles, 
or 
over 
40 
per 
cent, 
fall 
to 
the 
share 
of 
the 
syndicates, 
Produgol 
and 
Prodameta—and 
the 
syndicates 
in 
the 
oil, 
metallurgical 
and 
cement 
industries. 
Thus, 
the 
merging 
of 
bank 
and 
industrial 
capital 
has 
also 
made 
great 
strides 
in 
Russia 
owing 
to 
the 
formulation 
of 
capitalist 
monopolies. 


Finance 
capital, 
concentrated 
in 
a 
few 
hands 
and 
exercising 
a 
virtual 
monopoly, 
exacts 
enormous 
and 
ever-increasing 
profits 
from 
the 
floating 
of 
companies, 
issue 
of 
stock, 
state 
loans, 
etc., 
tightens 
the 
grip 
of 
the 
financial 
oligarchies 
and 
levies 
tribute 
upon 
the 
whole 
of 
society 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
monopolists. 
Here 
is 
an 
example, 
taken 
from 
a 
multitude 
of 
others, 
of 
the 
methods 
employed 
by 
American 
trusts, 
quoted 
by 
Hilferding: 
in 
1887, 
Havemeyer 
founded 
the 
Sugar 
Trust 
by 
amalgamating 
fifteen 
small 
firms, 



whose 
total 
capital 
amounted 
to 
nearly 
$6,500,000. 
Suitably 
“watered,” 
as 
the 
Americans 
say, 
the 
capital 
of 
the 
trust 
was 
increased 
to 
$50,-000, 
000. 
This 
“over-capitalization” 
anticipated 
the 
profits 
of 
the 
monopoly, 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
the 
United 
States 
Steel 
Corporation 
anticipated 
its 
profits 
by 
buying 
up 
as 
many 
iron 
fields 
as 
possible. 
In 
fact, 
the 
Sugar 
Trust 
managed 
to 
impose 
monopoly 
prices 
on 
the 
market, 
which 
secured 
it 
such 
profits 
that 
it 
could 
pay 
10 
per 
cent 
dividend 
on 
capital 
“watered” 
sevenfold, 
or 
about 
70 
per 
cent 
on 
the 
capital 
actually 
invested 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
trust! 
In 
1909, 
the 
capital 
of 
the 
Sugar 
Trust 
was 
increased 
to 
$90,000,000. 
In 
twenty-two 
years, 
it 
had 
increased 
its 
capital 
more 
than 
tenfold. 


In 
France 
the 
role 
of 
the 
“financial 
oligarchy” 
(Against 
the 
Financial 
Oligarchy 
in 
France, 
the 
title 
of 
the 
well-known 
book 
by 
Lysis, 
the 
fifth 
edition 
of 
which 
was 
published 
in 
1908) 
assumed 
a 
form 
that 
was 
only 
slightly 
different. 
Four 
of 
the 
most 
powerful 
banks 
enjoy, 
not 
a 
relative, 
but 
an 
“absolute 
monopoly” 
in 
the 
issue 
of 
bonds. 
In 
reality 
this 
is 
a 
“trust 
of 
the 
big 
banks.” 
And 
their 
monopoly 
ensures 
the 
monopolist 
profits 
from 
bond 
issues. 
A 
country 
borrowing 
from 
France 
rarely 
gets 
more 
than 
90 
per 
cent 
of 
the 
total 
of 
the 
loan, 
the 
remaining 
10 
per 
cent 
goes 
to 
the 
banks 
of 
other 
middlemen. 
The 
profit 
made 
by 
the 
banks 
out 
of 
the 
Russo-Chinese 
loans 
of 
400,000,000 
francs 
amounted 
to 
8 
per 
cent; 
out 
of 
the 
Russian 
(1904) 
loan 
of 
800,000,000 
francs 
the 
profit 
amounted 
to 
10 
per 
cent; 
and 
out 
of 
the 
Moroccan 
(1904) 
loan 
of 
62,500,000 
francs, 
to 
18.75 
per 
cent. 
Capitalism, 
which 
began 
its 
development 
with 
petty 
usury 
capital, 
ends 
its 
development 
with 
gigantic 
usury 
capital. 
“The 
French,” 
says 
Lysis, 
“are 
the 
usurers 
of 
Europe.” 
All 
the 
conditions 
of 
economic 
life 
are 
being 
profoundly 
modified 
by 
this 
transformation 
of 
capitalism. 
With 
a 
stationary 
population, 
and 
stagnant 
industry, 
commerce 
and 
shipping, 
the 
“country” 
can 
grow 
rich 
by 
usury. 
“Fifty 
persons, 
representing 
a 
capital 
of 
8,000,000 
francs 
can 
control 
2,000,000,000 
francs 
deposited 
in 
four 
banks.” 
The 
“holding 
system,” 
with 
which 
we 
are 
already 
familiar, 
leads 
to 
the 
same 
result. 
One 
of 
the 
biggest 
banks, 
the 
Société 
Générale, 
for 
instance, 
issues 
64,000 
bonds 
for 
one 
of 
its 
subsidiary 
companies, 
the 
Egyptian 
Sugar 
Refineries. 
The 
bonds 
are 
issued 
at 
150 
per 
cent, 
the 
bank 
gaining 
50 
centimes 
on 
the 
franc. 
The 
dividends 
of 
the 
new 
company 
are 
then 
found 
to 
be 
fictitious. 
The 
“public” 
lost 
from 
90 
to 
100 
million 
francs. 
One 
of 
the 
directors 
of 
the 
Société 
Générale 
is 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors 
of 
the 
Egyptian 
Sugar 
Refineries. 
Hence 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
the 
author 
is 
driven 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
“the 
French 



Republic 
is 
a 
financial 
monarchy”; 
“it 
is 
the 
complete 
domination 
of 
the 
financial 
oligarchy; 
the 
latter 
controls 
the 
press 
and 
the 
government.” 


The 
extraordinarily 
high 
rate 
of 
profit 
obtained 
from 
the 
issue 
of 
bonds, 
which 
is 
one 
of 
the 
principal 
functions 
of 
finance 
capital, 
plays 
a 
large 
part 
in 
the 
development 
and 
stabilization 
of 
the 
financial 
oligarchy. 


“There 
is 
not 
in 
the 
whole 
country 
a 
single 
business 
that 
brings 
in 
profits 
even 
approximately 
equal 
to 
those 
obtained 
from 
the 
issue 
of 
foreign 
loans,” 
says 
the 
German 
magazine, 
Die 
Bank. 


“No 
banking 
operation 
brings 
in 
profits 
comparable 
with 
those 
obtained 
from 
the 
flotation 
of 
loans.” 


According 
to 
the 
German 
Economist, 
the 
average 
annual 
profits 
made 
on 
the 
issue 
of 
industrial 
securities 
were 
as 
follows: 


In 
the 
ten 
years 
from 
1891 
to 
1900, 
more 
than 
a 
billion 
marks 
were 
“earned” 
on 
the 
issue 
of 
industrial 
securities. 


While, 
during 
periods 
of 
industrial 
boom, 
the 
profits 
of 
finance 
capital 
are 
disproportionately 
large, 
during 
periods 
of 
depression 
small 
and 
unsound 
businesses 
go 
out 
of 
existence 
and 
the 
big 
banks 
take 
“holdings” 
in 
their 
shares 
which 
are 
bought 
up 
for 
next 
to 
nothing, 
or 
in 
profitable 
schemes 
for 
their 
“reconstruction” 
and 
“reorganization.” 
In 
the 
“reconstruction” 
of 
undertakings 
which 
have 
been 
running 
at 
a 
loss, 
the 
share 
capital 
is 
written 
down, 
that 
is, 
profits 
are 
distributed 
on 
a 
smaller 
capital 
and 
subsequently 
are 
calculated 
on 
this 
smaller 
basis. 
If 
the 
income 
has 
fallen 
to 
nil, 
new 
capital 
is 
called 
in, 
which, 
combined 
with 
the 
old 
and 
less 
remunerative 
capital, 
will 
bring 
in 
an 
adequate 
return. 


“Incidentally,” 
adds 
Hilferding, 
“these 
reorganizations 
and 
reconstructions 
have 
a 
twofold 
significance 
for 
the 
banks: 
first, 
as 
profitable 
transactions; 
and 
secondly, 
as 
opportunities 
for 
securing 
control 
of 
the 
companies 
in 
difficulties.” 


Here 
is 
an 
instance. 
The 
Union 
Mining 
Company 
of 
Dortmund, 
founded 
in 
1872, 
with 
a 
capital 
of 
about 
40,000,000 
marks, 
saw 
the 
market 
price 
of 
shares 
rise 
to 
170 
after 
it 
had 
paid 
a 
12 
per 
cent 
dividend 
in 
its 
first 
year. 
Finance 
capital 
skimmed 
the 
cream 
and 
earned 
a 
“trifle” 
of 
something 
like 
28,000,000 
marks. 
The 
principal 
sponsor 
of 
this 
company 
was 
that 
very 
big 
German 
Disconto-Gesellschaft 
which 
so 
successfully 
attained 
a 
capital 
of 
300,000,000 
marks. 
Later, 
the 
dividends 
of 
the 
Union 
dropped 
to 
nil: 
the 
shareholders 
had 
to 
consent 
to 
a 
“writing 
down” 
of 
capital, 
that 
is, 
to 
losing 
some 
of 
it 
in 
order 
not 
to 
lose 
it 
all. 
By 
a 
series 
of 
“reconstructions” 
more 



than 
73,000,000 
marks 
were 
written 
off 
the 
books 
of 
the 
Union 
in 
the 
course 
of 
thirty 
years. 


“At 
the 
present 
time, 
the 
original 
shareholders 
of 
this 
company 
possess 
only 
5 
per 
cent 
of 
the 
nominal 
value 
of 
their 
shares.” 


But 
the 
bank 
made 
a 
profit 
out 
of 
every 
“reconstruction.” 


Speculation 
in 
land 
situated 
in 
the 
suburbs 
of 
rapidly 
growing 
towns 
is 
a 
particularly 
profitable 
operation 
for 
finance 
capital. 
The 
monopoly 
of 
the 
banks 
merges 
here 
with 
the 
monopoly 
of 
ground 
rent 
and 
with 
the 
monopoly 
of 
the 
means 
of 
communication, 
since 
the 
increase 
in 
value 
of 
the 
land 
and 
the 
possibility 
of 
selling 
it 
profitably 
in 
allotments 
is 
mainly 
dependent 
on 
good 
means 
of 
communication 
with 
the 
center 
of 
the 
town; 
and 
these 
means 
of 
communication 
are 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
large 
companies 
connected, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
holding 
system 
and 
by 
the 
distribution 
of 
positions 
on 
the 
directorates, 
with 
the 
interested 
banks. 
As 
a 
result 
we 
get 
what 
the 
German 
writer, 
L. 
Eschwege, 
a 
contributor 
to 
Die 
Bank, 
who 
has 
made 
a 
special 
study 
of 
real 
estate 
business 
and 
mortgages, 
calls 
the 
formation 
of 
a 
“bog.” 
Frantic 
speculation 
in 
land 
in 
the 
suburbs 
of 
large 
towns: 
collapse 
of 
building 
enterprises 
(like 
that 
of 
the 
Berlin 
firm 
of 
Boswau 
and 
Knauer, 
which 
grabbed 
100,000,000 
marks 
with 
the 
help 
of 
the 
“sound 
and 
solid” 
Deutsche 
Bank—the 
latter 
acting, 
of 
course, 
discreetly 
behind 
the 
scenes 
through 
the 
holding 
system 
and 
getting 
out 
of 
it 
by 
losing 
“only” 
12,000,000 
marks), 
the 
ruin 
of 
small 
masters 
and 
of 
workers 
who 
get 
nothing 
from 
the 
fraudulent 
building 
firms, 
underhand 
agreements 
with 
the 
“honest” 
Berlin 
police 
and 
the 
Berlin 
administration 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
getting 
control 
of 
the 
issue 
of 
building 
sites, 
tenders, 
building 
licenses, 
etc. 


“American 
ethics,” 
so 
strongly 
but 
hypocritically 
condemned 
by 
European 
professors 
and 
well-meaning 
bourgeois, 
have, 
in 
the 
age 
of 
finance 
capital, 
become 
the 
ethics 
of 
literally 
every 
large 
city, 
no 
matter 
what 
country 
it 
is 
in. 


At 
the 
beginning 
of 
1914, 
there 
was 
talk 
in 
Berlin 
of 
the 
proposed 
formation 
of 
a 
traffic 
trust 
to 
combine 
three 
Berlin 
traffic 
undertakings, 
i.e., 
to 
establish 
“common 
interests” 
between 
the 
metropolitan 
electric 
railway, 
the 
tramway 
company 
and 
the 
omnibus 
company. 


“We 
know,” 
wrote 
Die 
Bank, 
“that 
this 
plan 
has 
been 
contemplated 
since 
it 
became 
known 
that 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
shares 
in 
the 
bus 
company 
has 
been 
acquired 
by 
the 
other 
two 
traffic 
companies. 
... 
We 
may 
believe 
those 
who 
are 
pursuing 
this 
aim 
when 
they 
say 
that 
by 
uniting 
the 
transport 
services, 



they 
will 
unify 
traffic 
and 
thus 
secure 
economies 
part 
of 
which 
will 
in 
time 
benefit 
the 
public. 
But 
the 
question 
is 
complicated 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
behind 
the 
traffic 
trust 
that 
is 
being 
formed 
are 
the 
banks, 
which, 
if 
they 
desire, 
can 
subordinate 
the 
means 
of 
communication, 
which 
they 
have 
monopolized, 
to 
the 
interests 
of 
their 
real 
estate 
business. 
To 
be 
convinced 
of 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
such 
a 
conjecture, 
we 
need 
only 
recall 
that 
at 
the 
very 
formation 
of 
the 
Elevated 
Railway 
Company 
the 
traffic 
interests 
became 
interlocked 
with 
the 
real 
estate 
interests 
of 
the 
bank 
which 
financed 
it, 
and 
this 
interlocking 
even 
created 
the 
prerequisites 
for 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
traffic 
enterprise. 
Its 
eastern 
line, 
in 
fact, 
was 
to 
run 
through 
land 
which, 
when 
it 
became 
certain 
the 
line 
was 
to 
be 
laid 
down, 
this 
bank 
sold 
to 
the 
real 
estate 
firm 
at 
an 
enormous 
profit 
for 
itself 
and 
for 
several 
partners 
in 
the 
transaction.” 


A 
monopoly, 
once 
it 
is 
formed 
and 
controls 
thousands 
of 
millions, 
inevitably 
penetrates 
into 
every 
sphere 
of 
public 
life, 
regardless 
of 
the 
form 
of 
government 
and 
all 
other 
“details.” 
In 
the 
economic 
literature 
of 
Germany 
one 
usually 
comes 
across 
the 
servile 
praise 
of 
the 
integrity 
of 
the 
Prussian 
bureaucracy, 
and 
allusions 
to 
the 
French 
Panama 
scandal 
and 
to 
political 
corruption 
in 
America. 
But 
the 
fact 
is 
that 
even 
the 
bourgeois 
literature 
devoted 
to 
German 
banking 
matters 
constantly 
has 
to 
go 
beyond 
the 
field 
of 
purely 
banking 
operations 
and 
to 
speak, 
for 
instance, 
of 
“the 
attraction 
of 
the 
banks” 
in 
reference 
to 
the 
increasing 
frequency 
with 
which 
public 
officials 
take 
employment 
with 
the 
banks. 


“How 
about 
the 
integrity 
of 
a 
state 
official 
who 
in 
his 
inmost 
heart 
is 
aspiring 
to 
a 
soft 
job 
in 
the 
Behrenstrasse?” 
(The 
street 
in 
Berlin 
in 
which 
the 
head 
office 
of 
the 
Deutsche 
Bank 
is 
situated.) 


In 
1909, 
the 
publisher 
of 
Die 
Bank, 
Alfred 
Lansburgh, 
wrote 
an 
article 
entitled 
“The 
Economic 
Significance 
of 
Byzantinism,” 
in 
which 
he 
incidentally 
referred 
to 
Wilhelm 
II’s 
tour 
of 
Palestine, 
and 
to 
“the 
immediate 
result 
of 
this 
journey,” 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
Bagdad 
railway, 
that 
fatal 
“great 
product 
of 
German 
enterprise, 
which 
is 
more 
responsible 
for 
the 
‘encirclement’ 
than 
all 
our 
political 
blunders 
put 
together.” 
(By 
encirclement 
is 
meant 
the 
policy 
of 
Edward 
VII 
of 
isolating 
Germany 
by 
surrounding 
her 
with 
an 
imperialist 
anti-German 
alliance.) 
In 
1912, 
another 
contributor 
to 
this 
magazine, 
Eschwege, 
to 
whom 
we 
have 
already 
referred, 
wrote 
an 
article 
entitled 
“Plutocracy 
and 
Bureaucracy,” 
in 
which 
he 
exposes 
the 
case 
of 
a 
German 
official 
named 
Volker, 
who 
was 
a 
zealous 
member 
of 
the 
Cartel 



Committee 
and 
who 
some 
time 
later 
obtained 
a 
lucrative 
post 
in 
the 
biggest 
cartel, 
i.e., 
the 
Steel 
Syndicate. 
Similar 
cases, 
by 
no 
means 
casual, 
forced 
this 
bourgeois 
author 
to 
admit 
that 
“the 
economic 
liberty 
guaranteed 
by 
the 
German 
Constitution 
is 
at 
present, 
in 
many 
departments 
of 
economic 
life, 
only 
a 
meaningless 
phrase” 
and 
that 
under 
the 
rule 
of 
the 
plutocrats, 
“the 
widest 
political 
liberty 
cannot 
save 
us 
from 
being 
converted 
into 
a 
nation 
of 
unfree 
people.” 


As 
for 
Russia, 
we 
will 
content 
ourselves 
by 
quoting 
one 
example. 
Some 
years 
ago, 
all 
the 
newspapers 
announced 
that 
Davidov, 
the 
director 
of 
the 
Credit 
Department 
of 
the 
Treasury, 
had 
resigned 
his 
post 
to 
take 
employment 
with 
a 
certain 
big 
bank 
at 
a 
salary 
which, 
according 
to 
the 
contract, 
was 
to 
amount 
to 
over 
one 
million 
rubles 
in 
the 
course 
of 
several 
years. 
The 
function 
of 
the 
Credit 
Department 
is 
to 
“co-ordinate 
the 
activities 
of 
all 
the 
credit 
institutions 
of 
the 
country”; 
it 
also 
grants 
subsidies 
to 
banks 
in 
St. 
Petersburg 
and 
Moscow 
amounting 
to 
between 
800 
and 
1,000 
million 
rubles. 


Generally 
speaking, 
under 
capitalism, 
the 
ownership 
of 
capital 
is 
separate 
from 
the 
application 
of 
capital 
to 
production; 
money 
capital 
is 
separate 
from 
industrial 
or 
productive 
capital; 
the 
rentier, 
living 
entirely 
on 
income 
obtained 
from 
money 
capital, 
is 
separated 
from 
the 
entrepreneur 
and 
from 
all 
those 
directly 
concerned 
in 
the 
management 
of 
capital. 
Imperialism, 
or 
the 
rule 
of 
finance 
capital, 
is 
that 
highest 
stage 
of 
capitalism 
in 
which 
this 
separation 
reaches 
vast 
proportions. 
The 
supremacy 
of 
finance 
capital 
over 
all 
other 
forms 
of 
capital 
means 
the 
rule 
of 
the 
rentier 
and 
of 
the 
financial 
oligarchy; 
it 
means 
the 
crystallization 
of 
a 
small 
number 
of 
financially 
“powerful” 
states 
from 
among 
all 
the 
rest. 
The 
extent 
to 
which 
this 
process 
is 
going 
on 
may 
be 
judged 
from 
the 
statistics 
on 
emissions, 
i.e., 
the 
issue 
of 
all 
kinds 
of 
securities. 


In 
the 
Bulletin 
of 
the 
International 
Statistical 
Institute, 
A. 
Neymarck 
has 
published 
very 
comprehensive 
and 
complete 
comparative 
figures 
covering 
the 
issue 
of 
securities 
all 
over 
the 
world, 
which 
have 
been 
repeatedly 
quoted 
in 
economic 
literature. 
The 
following 
are 
the 
totals 
he 
gives 
for 
four 
decades: 


TOTAL 
ISSUES 
IN 
BILLIONS 
OF 
FRANCS 


1871-1880 
76.1 
1881-1890 
64.5 
1891-1900 
100.4 
1901-1910 
197.8 



In 
the 
1870’s, 
the 
total 
amount 
of 
issues 
for 
the 
whole 
world 
was 
high, 
owing 
particularly 
to 
the 
loans 
floated 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
Franco-Prussian 
War, 
and 
the 
company 
promoting 
boom 
which 
set 
in 
in 
Germany 
after 
the 
war. 
In 
general, 
the 
increase 
is 
not 
very 
rapid 
for 
the 
three 
last 
decades 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
and 
only 
in 
the 
first 
ten 
years 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century 
is 
an 
enormous 
increase 
observed 
of 
almost 
100 
per 
cent. 
Thus 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century 
marks 
the 
turning 
point, 
not 
only 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
growth 
of 
monopolies 
(cartels, 
syndicates, 
trusts), 
of 
which 
we 
have 
already 
spoken, 
but 
also 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
development 
of 
finance 
capital. 


Neymarck 
estimates 
the 
total 
amount 
of 
issued 
securities 
current 
in 
the 
world 
in 
1910 
at 
about 
815,000,000,000 
francs. 
Deducting 
from 
this 
amounts 
which 
might 
have 
been 
duplicated, 
he 
reduces 
the 
total 
to 
575-600 
billion, 
which 
is 
distributed 
among 
the 
various 
countries 
as 
follows: 
(We 
will 
take 
600,000,000,000.)

It 
will 
be 
seen 
at 
once 
from 
these 
figures 
what 
a 
privileged 
position 
is 
held 
by 
four 
of 
the 
richest 
capitalist 
countries, 
each 
of 
which 
controls 
securities 
to 
amounts 
ranging 
approximately 
from 
100 
to 
150 
billion 
francs. 
Two 
of 
these 
countries 
are 
the 
oldest 
capitalist 
countries, 
and, 
as 
we 
shall 
see, 



possess 
the 
most 
colonies: 
England 
and 
France; 
the 
other 
two 
are 
in 
the 
front 
rank 
as 
regards 
rapidity 
of 
development 
and 
the 
degree 
of 
extension 
of 
capitalist 
monopolies 
in 
industry: 
the 
United 
States 
and 
Germany. 
Together, 
these 
four 
countries 
own 
479,000,000,000 
francs, 
that 
is, 
nearly 
80 
per 
cent 
of 
the 
world’s 
finance 
capital. 
Thus, 
in 
one 
way 
or 
another, 
the 
whole 
world 
is 
more 
or 
less 
the 
debtor 
to 
and 
vassal 
of 
these 
four 
international 
banker 
countries, 
the 
four 
“pillars” 
of 
world 
finance 
capital. 


It 
is 
particularly 
important 
to 
examine 
the 
part 
which 
capital 
exports 
play 
in 
creating 
the 
international 
network 
of 
dependence 
and 
ties 
of 
finance 
capital. 



Chapter 
Iv 


The 
Export 
Of 
Capital 


Under 
the 
old 
type 
of 
capitalism, 
when 
free 
competition 
prevailed, 
the 
export 
of 
goods 
was 
the 
most 
typical 
feature. 
Under 
modern 
capitalism, 
when 
monopolies 
prevail, 
the 
export 
of 
capital 
has 
become 
the 
typical 
feature. 


Capitalism 
is 
commodity 
production 
at 
the 
highest 
stage 
of 
development, 
when 
labor 
power 
itself 
becomes 
a 
commodity. 
The 
growth 
of 
internal 
exchange, 
and 
particularly 
of 
international 
exchange, 
is 
a 
special 
feature 
of 
capitalism. 
The 
uneven 
and 
spasmodic 
character 
of 
the 
development 
of 
individual 
enterprises, 
of 
individual 
branches 
of 
industry 
and 
individual 
countries, 
is 
inevitable 
under 
the 
capitalist 
system. 
England 
became 
a 
capitalist 
country 
before 
any 
other, 
and 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
having 
adopted 
free 
trade, 
claimed 
to 
be 
the 
“workshop 
of 
the 
world,” 
the 
great 
purveyor 
of 
manufactured 
goods 
to 
all 
other 
countries, 
which 
in 
exchange 
were 
to 
keep 
her 
supplied 
with 
raw 
materials. 
In 
the 
last 
quarter 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
this 
monopoly 
was 
already 
undermined. 
Other 
countries, 
protecting 
themselves 
by 
tariff 
walls, 
had 
developed 
into 
independent 
capitalist 
countries. 
On 
the 
threshold 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century, 
we 
see 
a 
new 
type 
of 
monopoly 
coming 
into 
existence. 
First, 
there 
are 
monopolist 
capitalist 
combines 
in 
all 
advanced 
capitalist 
countries; 
secondly, 
a 
few 
rich 
countries, 
in 
which 
the 
accumulation 
of 
capital 
reaches 
gigantic 
proportions, 
occupy 
a 
monopolist 
position. 
An 
enormous 
“superfluity 
of 
capital” 
has 
accumulated 
in 
the 
advanced 
countries. 


It 
goes 
without 
saying 
that 
if 
capitalism 
could 
develop 
agriculture, 
which 
today 
lags 
far 
behind 
industry 
everywhere, 
if 
it 
could 
raise 
the 
standard 
of 
living 
of 
the 
masses, 
who 
are 
everywhere 
still 
poverty-stricken 
and 
underfed, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
amazing 
advance 
in 
technical 
knowledge, 
there 
could 
be 
no 
talk 
of 
a 
superfluity 
of 
capital. 
This 
“argument” 
the 
petty-bourgeois 
critics 
of 
capitalism 
advance 
on 
every 
occasion. 
But 
if 
capitalism 
did 
these 
things 
it 
would 
not 
be 
capitalism; 
for 
uneven 
development 
and 
wretched 
conditions 
of 
the 
masses 
are 
the 
fundamental 
and 
inevitable 
conditions 
and 
premises 
of 
this 
mode 
of 
production. 
As 
long 
as 
capitalism 
remains 
what 
it 
is, 
surplus 
capital 
will 
never 
be 
utilized 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
raising 
the 
standard 
of 
living 
of 
the 
masses 
in 
a 
given 
country, 
for 
this 
would 
mean 
a 
decline 
in 
profits 
for 
the 



capitalists; 
it 
will 
be 
used 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
increasing 
those 
profits 
by 
exporting 
capital 
abroad 
to 
the 
backward 
countries. 
In 
these 
backward 
countries, 
profits 
usually 
are 
high, 
for 
capital 
is 
scarce, 
the 
price 
of 
land 
is 
relatively 
low, 
wages 
are 
low, 
raw 
materials 
are 
cheap. 
The 
possibility 
of 
exporting 
capital 
is 
created 
by 
the 
entry 
of 
numerous 
backward 
countries 
into 
international 
capitalist 
intercourse; 
main 
railways 
have 
either 
been 
built 
or 
are 
being 
built 
there; 
the 
elementary 
conditions 
for 
industrial 
development 
have 
been 
created, 
etc. 
The 
necessity 
of 
exporting 
capital 
arises 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
a 
few 
countries 
capitalism 
has 
become 
“over-ripe” 
and 
(owing 
to 
the 
backward 
state 
of 
agriculture 
and 
the 
impoverished 
state 
of 
the 
masses) 
capital 
cannot 
find 
“profitable” 
investment. 


Here 
are 
approximate 
figures 
showing 
the 
amount 
of 
capital 
invested 
abroad 
by 
the 
three 
principal 
countries: 


CAPITAL 
INVESTED 
ABROAD 
(In 
billions 
of 
francs) 


This 
table 
shows 
that 
the 
export 
of 
capital 
reached 
formidable 
dimensions 
only 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century. 
Before 
the 
war 
the 
capital 
invested 
abroad 
by 
the 
three 
principal 
countries 
amounted 
to 
between 
175 
and 
200 
billion 
francs. 
At 
the 
modest 
rate 
of 
5 
per 
cent, 
this 
sum 
brought 
in 
from 
8 
to 
10 
billions 
a 
year. 
This 
provided 
a 
solid 
basis 
for 
imperialist 
oppression 
and 
the 
exploitation 
of 
most 
of 
the 
countries 
and 
nations 
of 
the 
world; 
a 
solid 
basis 
for 
the 
capitalist 
parasitism 
of 
a 
handful 
of 
wealthy 
states! 


How 
is 
this 
capital 
invested 
abroad 
distributed 
among 
the 
various 
countries? 
Where 
does 
it 
go? 
Only 
an 
approximate 
answer 
can 
be 
given 
to 
this 
question, 
but 
sufficient 
to 
throw 
light 
on 
certain 
general 
relations 
and 
ties 
of 
modern 
imperialism. 


APPROXIMATE 
DISTRIBUTION 
OF 
FOREIGN 
CAPITAL 
(ABOUT 
1910) 
(In 
billions 
of 
marks) 


The 
principal 
spheres 
of 
investment 
of 
British 
capital 
are 
the 
British 
colonies, 
which 
are 
very 
large 
also 
in 
America 
(for 
example, 
Canada), 
as 
well 
as 
in 
Asia, 
etc. 
In 
this 
case, 
enormous 
exports 
of 
capital 
are 
bound 
up 
with 
the 
possession 
of 
enormous 
colonies, 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
which 
for 
imperialism 
we 
shall 
speak 
later. 
In 
regard 
to 
France, 
the 
situation 
is 
quite 
different. 
French 
capital 
exports 
are 
invested 
mainly 
in 
Europe, 
particularly 
in 
Russia 
(at 
least 
ten 
billion 
francs). 
This 
is 
mainly 
loan 
capital, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
government 
loans 
and 
not 
investments 
in 
industrial 
undertakings. 
Unlike 
British 
colonial 
imperialism, 
French 
imperialism 
might 
be 
termed 
usury 



imperialism. 
In 
regard 
to 
Germany, 
we 
have 
a 
third 
type; 
the 
German 
colonies 
are 
inconsiderable, 
and 
German 
capital 
invested 
abroad 
is 
divided 
fairly 
evenly 
between 
Europe 
and 
America. 


The 
export 
of 
capital 
greatly 
affects 
and 
accelerates 
the 
development 
of 
capitalism 
in 
those 
countries 
to 
which 
it 
is 
exported. 
While, 
therefore, 
the 
export 
of 
capital 
may 
tend 
to 
a 
certain 
extent 
to 
arrest 
development 
in 
the 
countries 
exporting 
capital, 
it 
can 
only 
do 
so 
by 
expanding 
and 
deepening 
the 
further 
development 
of 
capitalism 
throughout 
the 
world. 


The 
countries 
which 
export 
capital 
are 
nearly 
always 
able 
to 
obtain 
“advantages,” 
the 
character 
of 
which 
throws 
light 
on 
the 
peculiarities 
of 
the 
epoch 
of 
finance 
capital 
and 
monopoly. 
The 
following 
passage, 
for 
instance, 
occurred 
in 
the 
Berlin 
review, 
Die 
Bank, 
for 
October 
1913: 


“A 
comedy 
worthy 
of 
the 
pen 
of 
Aristophanes 
is 
being 
played 
just 
now 
on 
the 
international 
money 
market. 
Numerous 
foreign 
countries, 
from 
Spain 
to 
the 
Balkan 
states, 
from 
Russia 
to 
the 
Argentine, 
Brazil 
and 
China, 
are 
openly 
or 
secretly 
approaching 
the 
big 
money 
markets 
demanding 
loans, 
some 
of 
which 
are 
very 
urgent. 
The 
money 
market 
is 
not 
at 
the 
moment 
very 
bright 
and 
the 
political 
outlook 
is 
not 
yet 
promising. 
But 
not 
a 
single 
money 
market 
dares 
to 
refuse 
a 
loan 
for 
fear 
that 
its 
neighbor 
might 
grant 
it 
and 
so 
secure 
some 
small 
reciprocal 
service. 
In 
these 
international 
transactions 
the 
creditor 
nearly 
always 
manages 
to 
get 
some 
special 
advantages: 
an 
advantage 
of 
a 
commercial-political 
nature, 
a 
coaling 
station, 
a 
contract 
to 
construct 
a 
harbor, 
a 
fat 
concession, 
or 
an 
order 
for 
guns.” 


Finance 
capital 
has 
created 
the 
epoch 
of 
monopolies, 
and 
monopolies 
introduce 
everywhere 
monopolist 
methods: 
the 
utilization 
of 
“connections” 
for 
profitable 
transactions 
takes 
the 
place 
of 
competition 
on 
the 
open 
market. 
The 
most 
usual 
thing 
is 
to 
stipulate 
that 
part 
of 
the 
loan 
that 
is 
granted 
shall 
be 
spent 
on 
purchases 
in 
the 
country 
of 
issue, 
particularly 
on 
orders 
for 
war 
materials, 
or 
for 
ships, 
etc. 
In 
the 
course 
of 
the 
last 
two 
decades 
(1890-1910), 
France 
often 
resorted 
to 
this 
method. 
The 
export 
of 
capital 
abroad 
thus 
becomes 
a 
means 
for 
encouraging 
the 
export 
of 
commodities. 
In 
these 
circumstances 
transactions 
between 
particularly 
big 
firms 
assume 
a 
form 
“bordering 
on 
corruption,” 
as 
Schilder 
“delicately” 
puts 
it. 
Krupp 
in 
Germany, 
Schneider 
in 
France, 
Armstrong 
in 
England, 
are 
instances 
of 
firms 
having 
close 
connections 
with 
powerful 
banks 
and 
governments 
whose 
“share” 
must 
not 
be 
forgotten 
when 
arranging 
a 
loan. 


France 
granted 
loans 
to 
Russia 
in 
1905 
and 
by 
the 
commercial 
treaty 
of 



September 
16, 
1905, 
she 
“squeezed” 
concessions 
out 
of 
her 
to 
run 
till 
1917. 
She 
did 
the 
same 
thing 
when 
the 
Franco-Japanese 
commercial 
treaty 
was 
concluded 
on 
August 
19, 
1911. 
The 
tariff 
war 
between 
Austria 
and 
Serbia, 
which 
lasted 
with 
a 
seven 
months’ 
interval, 
from 
1906 
to 
1911, 
was 
partly 
caused 
by 
competition 
between 
Austria 
and 
France 
for 
supplying 
Serbia 
with 
war 
material. 
In 
January 
1912, 
Paul 
Deschanel 
stated 
in 
the 
Chamber 
of 
Deputies 
that 
from 
1908 
to 
1911 
French 
firms 
had 
supplied 
war 
material 
to 
Serbia 
to 
the 
value 
of 
45,000,000 
francs. 


A 
report 
from 
the 
Austro-Hungarian 
Consul 
at 
Sao-Paulo 
(Brazil) 
states: 


“The 
construction 
of 
the 
Brazilian 
railways 
is 
being 
carried 
out 
chiefly 
by 
French, 
Belgian, 
British 
and 
German 
capital. 
In 
the 
financial 
operations 
connected 
with 
the 
construction 
of 
these 
railways 
the 
countries 
involved 
also 
stipulate 
for 
orders 
for 
the 
necessary 
railway 
material.” 


Thus, 
finance 
capital, 
almost 
literally, 
one 
might 
say, 
spreads 
its 
net 
over 
all 
countries 
of 
the 
world. 
Banks 
founded 
in 
the 
colonies, 
or 
their 
branches, 
play 
an 
important 
part 
in 
these 
operations. 
German 
imperialists 
look 
with 
envy 
on 
the 
“old” 
colonizing 
nations 
which 
in 
this 
respect 
are 
“well 
established.” 
In 
1904, 
Great 
Britain 
had 
50 
colonial 
banks 
with 
2,279 
branches 
(in 
1910 
there 
were 
72 
banks 
with 
5,449 
branches); 
France 
had 
20 
with 
136 
branches; 
Holland, 
16 
with 
68 
branches, 
and 
Germany 
had 
a 
“mere” 
13 
with 
70 
branches. 


The 
American 
capitalists, 
in 
their 
turn, 
are 
jealous 
of 
the 
English 
and 
German: 
“In 
South 
America,” 
they 
complained 
in 
1915, 
“five 
German 
banks 
had 
forty 
branches 
and 
five 
English 
banks 
had 
seventy.... 
During 
the 
last 
twenty-five 
years, 
Great 
Britain 
and 
Germany 
have 
invested 
in 
the 
Argentine, 
Brazil 
and 
Uruguay 
about 
four 
billion 
dollars, 
which 
places 
under 
their 
control 
46 
per 
cent 
of 
the 
total 
trade 
of 
these 
three 
countries.” 


The 
capital 
exporting 
countries 
have 
divided 
the 
world 
among 
themselves 
in 
the 
figurative 
sense 
of 
the 
term. 
But 
finance 
capital 
has 
also 
led 
to 
the 
actual 
division 
of 
the 
world. 



Chapter 
V 


The 
Division 
Of 
The 
World 
Among 
Capitalist 
Combines 


Monopolist 
capitalist 
combines—cartels, 
syndicates, 
trusts—divide 
among 
themselves, 
first 
of 
all, 
the 
whole 
internal 
market 
of 
a 
country, 
and 
impose 
their 
control, 
more 
or 
less 
completely, 
upon 
the 
industry 
of 
that 
country. 
But 
under 
capitalism 
the 
home 
market 
is 
inevitably 
bound 
up 
with 
the 
foreign 
market. 
Capitalism 
long 
ago 
created 
a 
world 
market. 
As 
the 
export 
of 
capital 
increased, 
and 
as 
the 
foreign 
and 
colonial 
relations, 
the 
“spheres 
of 
influence” 
of 
the 
big 
monopolist 
combines, 
expanded, 
things 
tended 
“naturally” 
toward 
an 
international 
agreement 
among 
these 
combines 
and 
toward 
the 
formation 
of 
international 
cartels. 


This 
is 
a 
new 
stage 
of 
world 
concentration 
of 
capital 
and 
production, 
incomparably 
higher 
than 
the 
preceding 
stages. 
Let 
us 
see 
how 
this 
super-
monopoly 
develops. 


The 
electrical 
industry 
is 
the 
most 
typical 
of 
the 
modern 
technical 
achievements 
of 
capitalism 
of 
the 
end 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
and 
beginning 
of 
the 
twentieth 
centuries. 
This 
industry 
has 
developed 
most 
in 
the 
two 
most 
advanced 
of 
the 
new 
capitalist 
countries, 
the 
United 
States 
and 
Germany. 
In 
Germany, 
the 
crisis 
of 
1900 
gave 
a 
particularly 
strong 
impetus 
to 
its 
concentration. 
During 
the 
crisis, 
the 
banks, 
which 
by 
this 
time 
had 
become 
fairly 
well 
merged 
with 
industry, 
greatly 
accelerated 
and 
deepened 
the 
collapse 
of 
relatively 
small 
firms 
and 
their 
absorption 
by 
the 
large 
ones. 


“The 
banks,” 
writes 
Jeidels, 
“in 
refusing 
a 
helping 
hand 
to 
the 
very 
companies 
which 
need 
it, 
bring 
on, 
after 
a 
frenzied 
boom, 
the 
hopeless 
failure 
of 
the 
companies 
which 
are 
not 
permanently 
closely 
attached 
to 
them.” 


As 
a 
result, 
after 
1900, 
concentration 
in 
Germany 
proceeded 
by 
leaps 
and 
bounds. 
Up 
to 
1900 
there 
had 
been 
seven 
or 
eight 
“groups” 
in 
the 
electrical 
industry. 
Each 
was 
formed 
of 
many 
companies 
(altogether 
there 
were 
twenty-
eight) 
and 
each 
was 
supported 
by 
from 
two 
to 
eleven 
banks. 
Between 
1908 
and 
1912 
all 
the 
groups 
were 
united 
into 
two, 
or 
possibly 
one. 
The 
diagram 
below 
shows 
the 
process: 


GROUPS 
IN 
THE 
GERMAN 
ELECTRICAL 
INDUSTRY 


The 
famous 
A.E.G. 
(General 
Electric 
Company), 
which 
grew 
up 
in 
this 
way, 
controls 
175 
to 
200 
companies 
(through 
share 
holdings), 
and 
a 
total 



capital 
of 
approximately 
1,500,-000, 
000 
marks. 
Abroad, 
it 
has 
thirty-four 
direct 
representatives, 
of 
which 
twelve 
are 
joint 
stock 
companies, 
in 
more 
than 
ten 
countries. 
As 
early 
as 
1904, 
the 
amount 
of 
capital 
invested 
abroad 
by 
the 
German 
electrical 
industry 
was 
estimated 
at 
233,000,000 
marks. 
Of 
this 
sum, 
62,000,000 
were 
invested 
in 
Russia. 
Needless 
to 
say, 
the 
A.E.G. 
is 
a 
huge 
combine. 
Its 
manufacturing 
companies 
alone 
number 
no 
less 
than 
sixteen, 
and 
their 
factories 
make 
the 
most 
varied 
articles, 
from 
cables 
and 
insulators 
to 
motor 
cars 
and 
aeroplanes. 


But 
concentration 
in 
Europe 
was 
a 
part 
of 
the 
process 
of 
concentration 
in 
America, 
which 
developed 
in 
the 
following 
way: 


Thus, 
two 
“Great 
Powers” 
in 
the 
electrical 
industry 
were 
formed. 
“There 
are 
no 
other 
electric 
‘powers’ 
in 
the 
world 
completely 
independent 
of 
them,” 
wrote 
Heinig 
in 
his 
article 
“The 
Path 
of 
the 
Electricity 
Trust.” 
An 
idea, 
although 
far 
from 
complete, 
of 
the 
turnover 
and 
the 
size 
of 
the 
enterprises 
of 
the 
two 
“trusts” 
can 
be 
obtained 
from 
the 
following 
figures: 


In 
1907, 
the 
German 
and 
American 
trusts 
concluded 
an 
agreement 
by 
which 
they 
divided 
the 
world 
between 
themselves. 
Competition 
between 
them 
ceased. 
The 
American 
General 
Electric 
Company 
“got” 
the 
United 
States 
and 
Canada. 
The 
A.E.G. 
“got” 
Germany, 
Austria, 
Russia, 
Holland, 
Denmark, 
Switzerland, 
Turkey 
and 
the 
Balkans. 
Special 
agreements, 
naturally 
secret, 
were 
concluded 
regarding 
the 
penetration 
of 
“subsidiary” 
companies 
into 
new 
branches 
of 
industry, 
into 
“new” 
countries 
formally 
not 
yet 
allotted. 
The 
two 
trusts 
were 
to 
exchange 
inventions 
and 
experiments. 


It 
is 
easy 
to 
understand 
how 
difficult 
competition 
has 
become 
against 
this 
trust, 
which 
is 
practically 
world-wide, 
which 
controls 
a 
capital 
of 
several 
billion 
marks, 
and 
has 
its 
“branches,” 
agencies, 
representatives, 
connections, 
etc., 
in 
every 
corner 
of 
the 
world. 
But 
the 
division 
of 
the 
world 
between 
two 
powerful 
trusts 
does 
not 
remove 
the 
possibility 
of 
re-division, 
if 
the 
relation 
of 
forces 
changes 
as 
a 
result 
of 
uneven 
development, 
war, 
bankruptcy, 
etc. 


The 
oil 
industry 
provides 
an 
instructive 
example 
of 
such 
a 
re-division, 
or 
rather 
of 
a 
struggle 
for 
re-division. 


“The 
world 
oil 
market,” 
wrote 
Jeidels 
in 
1905, 
“is 
even 
today 
divided 
in 
the 
main 
between 
two 
great 
financial 
groups—Rockefel—ler’s 
Standard 
Oil 
Co., 
and 
the 
controlling 
interests 
of 
the 
Russian 
oilfields 
in 
Baku, 
Rothschild 
and 
Nobel. 
The 
two 
groups 
are 
in 
close 
alliance. 
But 
for 
several 
years, 
five 
enemies 
have 
been 
threatening 
their 
monopoly”: 
1) 
The 
exhaustion 
of 
the 
American 
wells; 
2) 
the 
competition 
of 
the 
firm 
of 
Mantashev 
of 
Baku; 
3) 
the 



Austrian 
wells; 
4) 
the 
Rumanian 
wells; 
5) 
the 
transoceanic 
oil-fields, 
particularly 
in 
the 
Dutch 
colonies 
(the 
extremely 
rich 
firms, 
Samuel 
and 
Shell, 
also 
connected 
with 
British 
capital). 
The 
three 
last 
groups 
are 
connected 
with 
the 
great 
German 
banks, 
principally 
the 
Deutsche 
Bank. 
These 
banks 
independently 
and 
systematically 
developed 
the 
oil 
industry 
in 
Rumania, 
in 
order 
to 
have 
a 
foothold 
of 
their 
“own.” 
In 
1907, 
185,000,000 
francs 
of 
foreign 
capital 
were 
invested 
in 
the 
Rumanian 
oil 
industry, 
of 
which 
74,000,000 
came 
from 
Germany. 


A 
struggle 
began, 
which, 
in 
economic 
literature, 
is 
fittingly 
called 
“the 
struggle 
for 
the 
division 
of 
the 
world.” 
On 
one 
side, 
the 
Rockefeller 
trust, 
wishing 
to 
conquer 
everything, 
formed 
a 
subsidiary 
company 
right 
in 
Holland, 
and 
bought 
up 
oil 
wells 
in 
the 
Dutch 
Indies, 
in 
order 
to 
strike 
at 
its 
principal 
enemy, 
the 
Anglo-Dutch 
Shell 
trust. 
On 
the 
other 
side, 
the 
Deutsche 
Bank 
and 
the 
other 
German 
banks 
aimed 
at 
“retaining” 
Rumania 
“for 
themselves” 
and 
at 
uniting 
it 
with 
Russia 
against 
Rockefeller. 
The 
latter 
controlled 
far 
more 
capital 
and 
an 
excellent 
system 
of 
oil 
transport 
and 
distribution. 
The 
struggle 
had 
to 
end, 
and 
did 
end 
in 
1907, 
with 
the 
defeat 
of 
the 
Deutsche 
Bank, 
which 
was 
forced 
to 
choose 
between 
two 
alternatives, 
either 
to 
liquidate 
its 
oil 
business 
and 
lose 
millions, 
or 
to 
submit. 
It 
chose 
to 
submit, 
and 
concluded 
a 
very 
disadvantageous 
agreement 
with 
the 
American 
trust. 
The 
Deutsche 
Bank 
agreed 
“not 
to 
attempt 
anything 
which 
might 
injure 
American 
interests.” 
Provision 
was 
made, 
however, 
for 
the 
annulment 
of 
the 
agreement 
in 
the 
event 
of 
Germany 
establishing 
a 
state 
oil 
monopoly. 


Then 
the 
“comedy 
of 
oil” 
began. 
One 
of 
the 
German 
finance 
kings, 
von 
Gwinner, 
a 
director 
of 
the 
Deutsche 
Bank, 
began 
through 
his 
private 
secretary, 
Strauss, 
a 
campaign 
for 
a 
state 
oil 
monopoly. 
The 
gigantic 
machine 
of 
the 
big 
German 
bank 
and 
all 
its 
“connections” 
were 
set 
in 
motion. 
The 
press 
bubbled 
over 
with 
“patriotic” 
indignation 
against 
the 
“yoke” 
of 
the 
American 
trust, 
and, 
on 
March 
15, 
1911, 
the 
Reichstag 
by 
an 
almost 
unanimous 
vote 
adopted 
a 
motion 
asking 
the 
government 
to 
introduce 
a 
bill 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
oil 
monopoly. 
The 
government 
seized 
upon 
this 
“popular” 
idea 
and 
the 
game 
of 
the 
Deutsche 
Bank, 
which 
hoped 
to 
deceive 
its 
American 
partner 
and 
improve 
its 
business 
by 
a 
state 
monopoly, 
appeared 
to 
have 
been 
won. 
The 
German 
oil 
magnates 
saw 
visions 
of 
wonderful 
profits, 
which 
would 
not 
be 
less 
than 
those 
of 
the 
great 
Russian 
sugar 
refiners.... 
But, 
first, 
the 
great 
German 
banks 
quarrelled 
among 
themselves 
over 
the 
division 
of 
the 
spoils; 
the 
Disconto-Gesellschaft 
exposed 
the 



covetous 
aims 
of 
the 
Deutsche 
Bank; 
secondly, 
the 
government 
took 
fright 
at 
the 
prospect 
of 
a 
struggle 
with 
Rockefeller; 
it 
was 
doubtful 
whether 
Germany 
could 
be 
sure 
of 
obtaining 
oil 
from 
other 
sources 
(the 
Rumanian 
output 
was 
small). 
Thirdly, 
just 
at 
that 
time 
the 
1913 
credits 
of 
a 
billion 
marks 
were 
voted 
for 
Germany’s 
war 
preparations. 
The 
project 
of 
the 
oil 
monopoly 
was 
postponed. 
The 
Rockefeller 
trust 
came 
out 
of 
the 
struggle, 
for 
the 
time 
being, 
victorious. 


The 
Berlin 
magazine, 
Die 
Bank, 
said 
in 
this 
connection 
that 
Germany 
could 
only 
fight 
the 
oil 
trust 
by 
establishing 
an 
electricity 
monopoly 
and 
by 
converting 
water 
power 
into 
cheap 
electricity. 


“But,” 
the 
author 
added, 
“the 
power 
monopoly 
will 
come 
when 
the 
producers 
need 
it, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
when 
the 
next 
great 
failure 
in 
the 
electrical 
industry 
is 
impending 
and 
when 
the 
powerful 
expensive 
electric 
stations 
which 
are 
now 
being 
put 
up 
at 
great 
cost 
everywhere 
by 
private 
electric 
concerns, 
which 
obtain 
partial 
monopolies 
from 
towns, 
from 
the 
state, 
etc., 
can 
no 
longer 
work 
at 
a 
profit. 
Water 
power 
will 
then 
have 
to 
be 
used. 
But 
this 
cannot 
be 
converted 
into 
cheap 
electricity 
at 
state 
expense; 
it 
will 
have 
to 
be 
handed 
over 
to 
‘a 
private 
monopoly 
controlled 
by 
the 
state,’ 
because 
of 
the 
immense 
compensation 
and 
damages 
that 
would 
have 
to 
be 
paid 
to 
private 
industry.... 
So 
it 
was 
with 
the 
nitrate 
monopoly; 
so 
it 
is 
with 
the 
oil 
monopoly; 
so 
it 
is 
with 
the 
petroleum 
monopoly; 
so 
it 
will 
be 
with 
the 
electric 
power 
monopoly. 
It 
is 
time 
our 
state 
socialists, 
who 
allow 
themselves 
to 
be 
blinded 
by 
beautiful 
principles, 
understood 
once 
and 
for 
all 
that 
in 
Germany 
monopolies 
have 
never 
pursued 
the 
aim, 
nor 
have 
they 
had 
the 
result 
of 
benefiting 
the 
consumer, 
or 
of 
handing 
over 
to 
the 
state 
part 
of 
the 
entrepreneurs’ 
profits; 
they 
have 
served 
only 
to 
sanitate, 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
state, 
private 
industries 
which 
were 
on 
the 
verge 
of 
bankruptcy.” 


Such 
are 
the 
valuable 
admissions 
which 
the 
German 
bourgeois 
economists 
are 
forced 
to 
make. 
We 
see 
plainly 
here 
how 
private 
monopolies 
and 
state 
monopolies 
are 
bound 
together 
in 
the 
age 
of 
finance 
capital; 
how 
both 
are 
but 
separate 
links 
in 
the 
imperialist 
struggle 
between 
the 
big 
monopolists 
for 
the 
division 
of 
the 
world. 


In 
mercantile 
shipping, 
the 
tremendous 
development 
of 
concentration 
has 
ended 
also 
in 
the 
division 
of 
the 
world. 
In 
Germany 
two 
powerful 
companies 
have 
raised 
themselves 
to 
first 
rank, 
the 
Hamburg-Amerika 
and 
the 
NordDeutscher-
Lloyd, 
each 
having 
a 
capital 
of 
200,000,000 
marks 
in 
stocks 
and 
bonds, 
and 
possessing 
185 
to 
189 
million 
marks 
worth 
of 
shipping 
tonnage. 



On 
the 
other 
side, 
in 
America, 
on 
January 
1, 
1903, 
the 
Morgan 
trust, 
the 
International 
Maritime 
Trading 
Company, 
was 
formed 
which 
united 
nine 
British 
and 
American 
steamship 
companies, 
and 
which 
controlled 
a 
capital 
of 
120,000,000 
dollars 
(480,000,000 
marks). 
As 
early 
as 
1903, 
the 
German 
giants 
and 
the 
Anglo-American 
trust 
concluded 
an 
agreement 
and 
divided 
the 
world 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
division 
of 
profits. 
The 
German 
companies 
undertook 
not 
to 
compete 
in 
the 
Anglo-American 
traffic. 
The 
ports 
were 
carefully 
allotted 
to 
each; 
a 
joint 
committee 
of 
control 
was 
set 
up. 
This 
contract 
was 
concluded 
for 
twenty 
years, 
with 
a 
prudent 
provision 
for 
its 
annulment 
in 
the 
event 
of 
war. 


Extremely 
instructive 
also 
is 
the 
story 
of 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
International 
Rail 
Cartel. 
The 
first 
attempt 
of 
the 
British, 
Belgian 
and 
German 
rail 
manufacturers 
to 
create 
such 
a 
cartel 
was 
made 
as 
early 
as 
1884, 
at 
the 
time 
of 
a 
severe 
industrial 
depression. 
The 
manufacturers 
agreed 
not 
to 
compete 
with 
one 
another 
for 
the 
internal 
markets 
of 
the 
countries 
involved, 
and 
they 
divided 
the 
foreign 
markets 
in 
the 
following 
quotas: 
Great 
Britain—66 
per 
cent; 
Germany—27 
per 
cent; 
Belgium 
—17 
per 
cent. 
India 
was 
reserved 
entirely 
for 
Great 
Britain. 
Joint 
war 
was 
declared 
against 
a 
British 
firm 
which 
remained 
outside 
the 
cartel. 
The 
cost 
of 
this 
economic 
war 
was 
met 
by 
a 
percentage 
levy 
on 
all 
sales. 
But 
in 
1886 
the 
cartel 
collapsed 
when 
two 
British 
firms 
retired 
from 
it. 
It 
is 
characteristic 
that 
agreement 
could 
not 
be 
achieved 
in 
the 
period 
of 
industrial 
prosperity 
which 
followed. 


At 
the 
beginning 
of 
1904, 
the 
German 
Steel 
Syndicate 
was 
formed. 
In 
November 
1904, 
the 
International 
Rail 
Cartel 
was 
revived 
with 
the 
following 
quotas 
for 
foreign 
trade: 
Great 
Britain—53.5 
per 
cent; 
Germany—28.83 
per 
cent; 
Belgium—17.67 
per 
cent. 
France 
came 
in 
later 
with 
4.8 
per 
cent, 
5.8 
per 
cent 
and 
6.4 
per 
cent 
in 
the 
first, 
second 
and 
third 
years 
respectively, 
in 
excess 
of 
the 
100 
per 
cent 
limit, 
i.e., 
when 
the 
total 
was 
104.8 
per 
cent, 
etc. 
In 
1905, 
the 
United 
States 
Steel 
Corporation 
entered 
the 
cartel; 
then 
Austria; 
then 
Spain. 


“At 
the 
present 
time,” 
wrote 
Vogelstein 
in 
1910, 
“the 
partition 
of 
the 
world 
is 
completed, 
and 
the 
big 
consumers, 
primarily 
the 
state 
railways— 
since 
the 
world 
has 
been 
parcelled 
out 
without 
consideration 
for 
their 
interests—can 
now 
dwell 
like 
the 
poet 
in 
the 
palace 
of 
Jupiter.” 


We 
will 
mention 
also 
the 
International 
Zinc 
Syndicate, 
established 
in 
1909, 
which 
divided 
output 
exactly 
among 
five 
groups 
of 
factories: 
German, 
Belgian, 
French, 
Spanish 
and 
British. 
Then 
there 
is 
the 
International 



Dynamite 
Trust, 
of 
which 
Liefmann 
says 
that 
it 
is 


“quite 
a 
modern 
close 
alliance 
between 
all 
the 
manufacturers 
of 
explosives 
who, 
with 
the 
English 
and 
French 
dynamite 
manufacturers 
who 
have 
organized 
in 
a 
similar 
manner, 
have 
divided 
the 
whole 
world 
among 
themselves, 
so 
to 
speak.” 


Altogether, 
Liefmann, 
in 
1897, 
counted 
about 
forty 
international 
cartels 
in 
which 
Germany 
had 
a 
share, 
while 
in 
1910 
there 
were 
about 
a 
hundred. 


Certain 
bourgeois 
writers 
(with 
whom 
K. 
Kautsky, 
who 
has 
completely 
abandoned 
the 
Marxian 
position 
he 
held, 
for 
example, 
in 
1909, 
has 
now 
associated 
himself) 
express 
the 
opinion 
that 
international 
cartels 
are 
the 
most 
striking 
expressions 
of 
the 
internationalization 
of 
capital, 
and 
that 
they, 
therefore, 
give 
the 
hope 
of 
peace 
among 
nations 
under 
capitalism. 
Theoretically, 
this 
opinion 
is 
absurd, 
while 
in 
practice 
it 
is 
a 
sophism 
and 
a 
dishonest 
defense 
of 
the 
worst 
opportunism. 
International 
cartels 
show 
to 
what 
point 
capitalist 
monopolies 
have 
developed, 
and 
they 
reveal 
the 
object 
of 
the 
struggle 
between 
the 
various 
capitalist 
groups. 
This 
last 
circumstance 
is 
the 
most 
important; 
it 
alone 
shows 
us 
the 
his-torico-economic 
significance 
of 
events; 
for 
the 
forms 
of 
the 
struggle 
may 
and 
do 
vary 
in 
accordance 
with 
varying, 
relatively 
particular 
and 
transitory 
causes, 
but 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
struggle, 
its 
class 
content, 
cannot 
change 
while 
classes 
exist. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
understand, 
for 
example, 
that 
it 
is 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
German 
bourgeoisie, 
whose 
theoretical 
arguments 
have 
now 
been 
adopted 
by 
Kautsky 
(we 
will 
deal 
with 
this 
later), 
to 
obscure 
the 
content 
of 
the 
contemporary 
economic 
struggle 
(the 
division 
of 
the 
world) 
and 
to 
emphasize 
one 
or 
another 
form 
of 
the 
struggle. 
Kautsky 
makes 
the 
same 
mistake. 
Of 
course, 
we 
have 
in 
mind 
not 
only 
the 
German 
bourgeoisie, 
but 
the 
bourgeoisie 
all 
over 
the 
world. 
The 
capitalists 
divide 
the 
world, 
not 
out 
of 
malice, 
but 
because 
the 
degree 
of 
concentration 
which 
has 
been 
reached 
forces 
them 
to 
adopt 
this 
method 
in 
order 
to 
get 
profits. 
And 
they 
divide 
it 
in 
proportion 
to 
capital, 
in 
proportion 
to 
“strength,” 
because 
there 
cannot 
be 
any 
other 
system 
of 
division 
under 
the 
system 
of 
commodity 
production 
and 
capitalism. 
But 
strength 
varies 
with 
the 
degree 
of 
economic 
and 
political 
development. 
In 
order 
to 
understand 
what 
takes 
place, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
know 
what 
questions 
are 
settled 
by 
this 
change 
of 
forces. 
The 
question 
as 
to 
whether 
these 
changes 
are 
“purely” 
economic 
or 
non-economic 
(e.g., 
military) 
is 
a 
secondary 
one, 
which 
does 
not 
in 
the 
least 
affect 
the 
fundamental 
view 
on 
the 
latest 
epoch 
of 
capitalism. 
To 
substitute 
for 
the 
question 
of 
the 
content 
of 
the 
struggle 
and 
agreements 
between 



capitalist 
combines 
the 
question 
of 
the 
form 
of 
these 
struggles 
and 
agreements 
(today 
peaceful, 
tomorrow 
war-like, 
the 
next 
day 
peaceful 
again) 
is 
to 
descend 
into 
sophistry. 


The 
epoch 
of 
modern 
capitalism 
shows 
us 
that 
certain 
relations 
are 
established 
between 
capitalist 
alliances, 
based 
on 
the 
economic 
partition 
of 
the 
world; 
while 
parallel 
to 
this 
fact 
and 
in 
connection 
with 
it, 
certain 
relations 
are 
established 
between 
political 
alliances, 
between 
states, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
territorial 
division 
of 
the 
world, 
of 
the 
struggle 
for 
colonies, 
of 
the 
“struggle 
for 
economic 
territory.” 



Chapter 
Vi 


The 
Division 
Of 
The 
World 
Among 
The 
Great 
Powers 


In 
his 
book, 
The 
Territorial 
Development 
of 
the 
European 
Colonies, 
A. 
Supan, 
the 
geographer, 
briefly 
sums 
up 
this 
development 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
as 
follows: 


PERCENTAGE 
OF 
TERRITORIES 
BELONGING 
TO 
THE 
EUROPEAN 
COLONIAL 
POWERS 
(INCLUDING 
UNITED 
STATES) 


“The 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
this 
period,” 
he 
concludes, 
“is, 
therefore, 
the 
division 
of 
Africa 
and 
Polynesia.” 


As 
there 
are 
no 
unoccupied 
territories—that 
is, 
territories 
that 
do 
not 
belong 
to 
any 
state—in 
Asia 
and 
America, 
Mr. 
Supan’s 
conclusion 
must 
be 
carried 
further 
and 
we 
must 
say 
that 
the 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
this 
period 
is 
the 
final 
partition 
of 
the 
globe—not 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
a 
new 
partition 
is 
impossible—on 
the 
contrary, 
new 
partitions 
are 
possible 
and 
inevitable—but 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
the 
colonial 
policy 
of 
the 
capitalist 
countries 
has 
completed 
the 
seizure 
of 
the 
unoccupied 
territories 
on 
our 
planet. 
For 
the 
first 
time 
the 
world 
is 
completely 
shared 
out, 
so 
that 
in 
the 
future 
only 
re-division 
is 
possible; 
territories 
can 
only 
pass 
from 
one 
“owner” 
to 
another, 
instead 
of 
passing 
as 
unowned 
territory 
to 
an 
“owner.” 


Hence, 
we 
are 
passing 
through 
a 
peculiar 
period 
of 
world 
colonial 
policy, 
which 
is 
closely 
associated 
with 
the 
“latest 
phase 
of 
capitalist 
development,” 
with 
finance 
capital. 
For 
this 
reason, 
it 
is 
essential 
to 
deal 
in 
detail 
with 
the 
facts, 
in 
order 
to 
ascertain 
exactly 
what 
distinguishes 
this 
period 
from 
those 
preceding 
it, 
and 
what 
the 
present 
situation 
is. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
two 
questions 
of 
fact 
arise 
here. 
Is 
an 
intensification 
of 
colonial 
policy, 
an 
intensification 
of 
the 
struggle 
for 
colonies, 
observed 
in 
this 
period 
of 
finance 
capital? 
And 
how, 
in 
this 
respect, 
is 
the 
world 
divided 
at 
the 
present 
time? 


The 
American 
writer, 
Morris, 
in 
his 
book 
The 
History 
of 
Colonization, 
has 
made 
an 
attempt 
to 
compile 
data 
on 
the 
colonial 
possessions 
of 
Great 
Britain, 
France 
and 
Germany 
during 
different 
periods 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century. 
The 
following 
is 
a 
brief 
summary 
of 
the 
results 
he 
has 
obtained: 


COLONIAL 
POSSESSIONS 


For 
Great 
Britain, 
the 
period 
of 
the 
enormous 
expansion 
of 
colonial 
conquests 
is 
that 
between 
1860 
and 
1880, 
and 
it 
was 
also 
very 
considerable 
in 



the 
last 
twenty 
years 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century. 
For 
France 
and 
Germany 
this 
period 
falls 
precisely 
in 
these 
last 
twenty 
years. 
We 
saw 
above 
that 
the 
apex 
of 
pre-monopoly 
capitalist 
development, 
of 
capitalism 
in 
which 
free 
competition 
was 
predominant, 
was 
reached 
in 
the 
sixties 
and 
seventies 
of 
the 
last 
century. 
We 
now 
see 
that 
it 
is 
precisely 
following 
that 
period 
that 
the 
“boom” 
in 
colonial 
annexations 
begins, 
and 
that 
the 
struggle 
for 
a 
territorial 
division 
of 
the 
world 
becomes 
extraordinarily 
keen. 
It 
is 
beyond 
doubt, 
therefore, 
that 
the 
transition 
of 
capitalism 
to 
monopoly 
capitalism, 
to 
finance 
capitalism, 
is 
connected 
with 
the 
intensification 
of 
the 
struggle 
for 
the 
partition 
of 
the 
world. 


Hobson, 
in 
his 
work 
on 
imperialism, 
marks 
the 
years 
1884-1900 
as 
the 
period 
of 
the 
intensification 
of 
the 
colonial 
“expansion” 
of 
the 
chief 
European 
states. 
According 
to 
his 
estimate, 
Great 
Britain 
during 
these 
years 
acquired 
3,700,000 
square 
miles 
of 
territory 
with 
a 
population 
of 
57,000,000 
inhabitants; 
France 
acquired 
3,600,000 
square 
miles 
with 
a 
population 
of 
36,500,000 
inhabitants; 
Germany, 
1,000,000 
square 
miles 
with 
a 
population 
of 
16,700,000 
inhabitants; 
Belgium, 
900,000 
square 
miles 
with 
30,000,000 
inhabitants; 
Portugal, 
800,000 
square 
miles 
with 
9,000,000 
inhabitants. 
The 
quest 
for 
colonies 
by 
all 
the 
capitalist 
states 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
and 
particularly 
since 
the 
1880’s, 
is 
a 
commonly 
known 
fact 
in 
the 
history 
of 
diplomacy 
and 
of 
foreign 
affairs. 


When 
free 
competition 
in 
Great 
Britain 
was 
at 
its 
height, 
i.e., 
between 
1840 
and 
1860, 
the 
leading 
British 
bourgeois 
politicians 
were 
opposed 
to 
colonial 
policy 
and 
were 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
the 
liberation 
of 
the 
colonies 
and 
their 
complete 
separation 
from 
Great 
Britain 
was 
inevitable 
and 
desirable. 
M. 
Beer, 
in 
an 
article, 
“Modern 
British 
Imperialism,” 
published 
in 
1898, 
shows 
that 
in 
1852, 
Disraeli, 
a 
statesman 
generally 
inclined 
towards 
imperialism, 
declared: 
“The 
colonies 
are 
millstones 
round 
our 
necks.” 
But 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
the 
heroes 
of 
the 
hour 
were 
Cecil 
Rhodes 
and 
Joseph 
Chamberlain, 
open 
advocates 
of 
imperialism, 
who 
applied 
the 
imperialist 
policy 
in 
the 
most 
cynical 
manner. 


It 
is 
not 
without 
interest 
to 
observe 
that 
even 
at 
that 
time 
these 
leading 
British 
bourgeois 
politicians 
fully 
appreciated 
the 
connection 
between 
what 
might 
be 
called 
the 
purely 
economic 
and 
the 
politico-social 
roots 
of 
modern 
imperialism. 
Chamberlain 
advocated 
imperialism 
by 
calling 
it 
a 
“true, 
wise 
and 
economical 
policy,” 
and 
he 
pointed 
particularly 
to 
the 
German, 
American 
and 
Belgian 
competition 
which 
Great 
Britain 
was 
encountering 
in 
the 
world 



market. 
Salvation 
lies 
in 
monopolies, 
said 
the 
capitalists 
as 
they 
formed 
cartels, 
syndicates 
and 
trusts. 
Salvation 
lies 
in 
monopolies, 
echoed 
the 
political 
leaders 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
hastening 
to 
appropriate 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
world 
not 
yet 
shared 
out. 
The 
journalist, 
Stead, 
relates 
the 
following 
remarks 
uttered 
by 
his 
close 
friend 
Cecil 
Rhodes 
in 
1895 
regarding 
his 
imperialist 
ideas: 


“I 
was 
in 
the 
East 
End 
of 
London 
yesterday 
and 
attended 
a 
meeting 
of 
the 
unemployed. 
I 
listened 
to 
the 
wild 
speeches, 
which 
were 
just 
a 
cry 
for 
‘bread,’ 
‘bread,’ 
‘bread,’ 
and 
on 
my 
way 
home 
I 
pondered 
over 
the 
scene 
and 
I 
became 
more 
than 
ever 
convinced 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
imperialism.... 
My 
cherished 
idea 
is 
a 
solution 
for 
the 
social 
problem, 
i.e., 
in 
order 
to 
save 
the 
40,000,000 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
from 
a 
bloody 
civil 
war, 
we 
colonial 
statesmen 
must 
acquire 
new 
lands 
for 
settling 
the 
surplus 
population, 
to 
provide 
new 
markets 
for 
the 
goods 
produced 
in 
the 
factories 
and 
mines. 
The 
Empire, 
as 
I 
have 
always 
said, 
is 
a 
bread 
and 
butter 
question. 
If 
you 
want 
to 
avoid 
civil 
war, 
you 
must 
become 
imperialists.” 


This 
is 
what 
Cecil 
Rhodes, 
millionaire, 
king 
of 
finance, 
the 
man 
who 
was 
mainly 
responsible 
for 
the 
Boer 
War, 
said 
in 
1895. 
His 
defense 
of 
imperialism 
is 
just 
crude 
and 
cynical, 
but 
in 
substance 
it 
does 
not 
differ 
from 
the 
“theory” 
advocated 
by 
Messrs. 
Maslov, 
Südekum, 
Potresov, 
David, 
the 
founder 
of 
Russian 
Marxism 
and 
others. 
Cecil 
Rhodes 
was 
a 
somewhat 
more 
honest 
social-chauvinist. 


To 
tabulate 
as 
exactly 
as 
possible 
the 
territorial 
division 
of 
the 
world, 
and 
the 
changes 
which 
have 
occurred 
during 
the 
last 
decades, 
we 
will 
take 
the 
data 
furnished 
by 
Supan 
in 
the 
work 
already 
quoted 
on 
the 
colonial 
possessions 
of 
all 
the 
powers 
of 
the 
world. 
Supan 
examines 
the 
years 
1876 
and 
1900; 
we 
will 
take 
the 
year 
1876—a 
year 
aptly 
selected, 
for 
it 
is 
precisely 
at 
that 
time 
that 
the 
pre-monopolist 
stage 
of 
development 
of 
West 
European 
capitalism 
can 
be 
said 
to 
have 
been 
completed, 
in 
the 
main, 
and 
we 
will 
take 
the 
year 
1914, 
and 
in 
place 
of 
Supan’s 
figures 
we 
will 
quote 
the 
more 
recent 
statistics 
of 
Hübner 
(Geographical 
and 
Statistical 
Tables). 
Supan 
gives 
figures 
for 
colonies 
only: 
we 
think 
it 
useful, 
in 
order 
to 
present 
a 
complete 
picture 
of 
the 
division 
of 
the 
world, 
to 
add 
brief 
figures 
on 
non-colonial 
and 
semi-colonial 
countries 
like 
Persia, 
China 
and 
Turkey. 
Persia 
is 
already 
almost 
completely 
a 
colony; 
China 
and 
Turkey 
are 
on 
the 
way 
to 
becoming 
colonies. 
We 
thus 
get 
the 
following 
summary: 


COLONIAL 
POSSESSIONS 
OF 
THE 
GREAT 
POWERS 
(In 
millions 
of 



square 
kilometers 
and 
in 
millions 
of 
inhabitants) 


We 
see 
from 
these 
figures 
how 
“complete” 
was 
the 
partition 
of 
the 
world 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
and 
beginning 
of 
the 
twentieth 
centuries. 
After 
1876 
colonial 
possessions 
increased 
to 
an 
enormous 
degree, 
more 
than 
one 
and 
a 
half 
times, 
from 
40,000,000 
to 
65,000,000 
square 
kilometers 
in 
area 
for 
the 
six 
biggest 
powers, 
an 
increase 
of 
25,000,000 
square 
kilometers, 
that 
is, 
one 
and 
a 
half 
times 
greater 
than 
the 
area 
of 
the 
“home” 
countries, 
which 
have 
a 
total 
of 
16,500,000 
square 
kilometers. 
In 
1876 
three 
powers 
had 
no 
colonies, 
and 
a 
fourth, 
France, 
had 
scarcely 
any. 
In 
1914 
these 
four 
powers 
had 
14,100,000 
square 
kilometers 
of 
colonies, 
or 
an 
area 
one 
and 
a 
half 
times 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
Europe, 
with 
a 
population 
of 
nearly 
100,000,000. 
The 
unevenness 
in 
the 
rate 
of 
expansion 
of 
colonial 
possessions 
is 
very 
marked. 
If, 
for 
instance, 
we 
compare 
France, 
Germany 
and 
Japan 
which 
do 
not 
differ 
very 
much 
in 
area 
and 
population, 
we 
will 
see 
that 
the 
first 
(France) 
has 
annexed 
almost 
three 
times 
as 
much 
colonial 
territory 
as 
the 
other 
two 
combined. 
But 
in 
regard 
to 
finance 
capital, 
also, 
France, 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
period 
we 
are 
considering, 
was 
perhaps 
several 
times 
richer 
than 
Germany 
and 
Japan 
put 
together. 
In 
addition 
to 
and 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
purely 
economic 
causes, 
geographical 
conditions 
and 
other 
factors 
also 
affect 
the 
dimensions 
of 
colonial 
possessions. 
However 
strong 
the 
process 
of 
levelling 
the 
world, 
of 
levelling 
economic 
and 
living 
conditions 
in 
different 
countries 
may 
have 
been 
in 
the 
past 
decades 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
pressure 
of 
large-scale 
industry, 
exchange 
and 
finance 
capital, 
great 
differences 
still 
remain; 
and 
even 
among 
the 
six 
powers 
we 
see, 
first, 
young 
capitalist 
powers 
(America, 
Germany, 
Japan) 
which 
progressed 
very 
rapidly; 
secondly, 
countries 
with 
an 
old 
capitalist 
development 
(France 
and 
Great 
Britain), 
which 
have 
made 
much 
slower 
progress 
of 
late 
than 
the 
previously 
mentioned 
countries, 
and 
thirdly, 
a 
country 
(Russia) 
which 
is 
economically 
most 
backward, 
in 
which 
modern 
capitalist 
imperialism 
is 
enmeshed, 
so 
to 
speak, 
in 
a 
thick 
web 
of 
precapitalist 
relations. 


Alongside 
the 
colonial 
possessions 
of 
these 
great 
powers, 
we 
have 
placed 
the 
small 
colonies 
of 
the 
small 
states, 
which 
are, 
so 
to 
speak, 
the 
next 
possible 
and 
probable 
objects 
of 
a 
new 
colonial 
“share-out.” 
Most 
of 
these 
little 
states 
are 
able 
to 
retain 
their 
colonies 
only 
because 
of 
the 
conflicting 
interests, 
frictions, 
etc., 
among 
the 
big 
powers, 
which 
prevent 
them 
from 
coming 
to 
an 
agreement 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
division 
of 
the 
spoils. 
The 
semi-
colonial 
states 
provide 
an 
example 
of 
the 
transitional 
forms 
which 
are 
to 
be 



found 
in 
all 
spheres 
of 
nature 
and 
society. 
Finance 
capital 
is 
such 
a 
great, 
it 
may 
be 
said, 
such 
a 
decisive 
force 
in 
all 
economic 
and 
international 
relations 
that 
it 
is 
capable 
of 
subordinating 
to 
itself, 
and 
actually 
does 
subordinate 
to 
itself, 
even 
states 
enjoying 
complete 
political 
independence. 
We 
shall 
shortly 
see 
examples 
of 
this. 
Naturally, 
finance 
capital 
finds 
it 
most 
“convenient,” 
and 
is 
able, 
to 
extract 
the 
greatest 
profit 
from 
a 
subordination 
which 
involves 
the 
loss 
of 
the 
political 
independence 
of 
the 
subjected 
countries 
and 
peoples. 
In 
this 
connection, 
the 
semi-colonial 
countries 
provide 
a 
typical 
example 
of 
the 
“middle 
stage.” 
It 
is 
natural 
that 
the 
struggle 
for 
these 
semi-dependent 
countries 
should 
have 
become 
particularly 
bitter 
during 
the 
period 
of 
finance 
capital, 
when 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
world 
had 
already 
been 
shared 
out. 


Colonial 
policy 
and 
imperialism 
existed 
before 
this 
latest 
stage 
of 
capitalism, 
and 
even 
before 
capitalism. 
Rome, 
founded 
on 
slavery, 
pursued 
a 
colonial 
policy 
and 
achieved 
imperialism. 
But 
“general” 
arguments 
about 
imperialism 
which 
ignore, 
or 
put 
into 
the 
background, 
the 
fundamental 
difference 
of 
social-economic 
systems, 
inevitably 
degenerate 
into 
absolutely 
empty 
banalities, 
or 
into 
grandiloquent 
comparisons 
like 
“Greater 
Rome 
and 
Greater 
Britain.” 
Even 
the 
colonial 
policy 
of 
capitalism 
in 
its 
previous 
stages 
is 
essentially 
different 
from 
the 
colonial 
policy 
of 
finance 
capital. 


The 
principal 
feature 
of 
modern 
capitalism 
is 
the 
domination 
of 
monopolist 
combines 
of 
the 
big 
capitalists. 
These 
monopolies 
are 
most 
durable 
when 
all 
the 
sources 
of 
raw 
materials 
are 
controlled 
by 
the 
one 
group. 
And 
we 
have 
seen 
with 
what 
zeal 
the 
international 
capitalist 
combines 
exert 
every 
effort 
to 
make 
it 
impossible 
for 
their 
rivals 
to 
compete 
with 
them; 
for 
example, 
by 
buying 
up 
mineral 
lands, 
oil 
fields, 
etc. 
Colonial 
possession 
alone 
gives 
complete 
guarantee 
of 
success 
to 
the 
monopolies 
against 
all 
the 
risks 
of 
the 
struggle 
with 
competitors, 
including 
the 
risk 
that 
the 
latter 
will 
defend 
themselves 
by 
means 
of 
a 
law 
establishing 
a 
state 
monopoly. 
The 
more 
capitalism 
develops, 
the 
more 
the 
need 
for 
raw 
materials 
arises, 
the 
more 
bitter 
competition 
becomes, 
and 
the 
more 
feverishly 
the 
hunt 
for 
raw 
materials 
proceeds 
all 
over 
the 
world, 
the 
more 
desperate 
becomes 
the 
struggle 
for 
the 
acquisition 
of 
colonies. 


Schilder 
writes: 


“It 
may 
even 
be 
asserted, 
although 
it 
may 
sound 
paradoxical 
to 
some, 
that 
in 
the 
more 
or 
less 
discernible 
future 
the 
growth 
of 
the 
urban 
industrial 
population 
is 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
hindered 
by 
a 
shortage 
of 
raw 
materials 
for 
industry 
than 
by 
a 
shortage 
of 
food.” 



For 
example, 
there 
is 
a 
growing 
shortage 
of 
timber—the 
price 
of 
which 
is 
steadily 
rising—of 
leather 
and 
raw 
materials 
for 
the 
textile 
industry. 


“As 
instances 
of 
the 
efforts 
of 
industrial 
associations 
to 
effect 
a 
balance 
between 
agriculture 
and 
industry 
in 
world 
industry 
we 
might 
mention 
the 
International 
Federation 
of 
Cotton 
Spinners’ 
Associations 
in 
the 
most 
important 
industrial 
countries, 
founded 
in 
1904, 
and 
the 
European 
Federation 
of 
Flax 
Spinners’ 
Associations, 
founded 
on 
the 
above 
pattern 
in 
1910.” 


The 
bourgeois 
reformists, 
and 
among 
them 
particularly 
the 
present-day 
adherents 
of 
Kautsky, 
of 
course, 
try 
to 
belittle 
the 
importance 
of 
facts 
of 
this 
kind 
by 
arguing 
that 
it 
“would 
be 
possible” 
to 
obtain 
raw 
materials 
in 
the 
open 
market 
without 
a 
“costly 
and 
dangerous” 
colonial 
policy; 
and 
that 
it 
“would 
be 
possible” 
to 
greatly 
increase 
the 
supply 
of 
raw 
materials 
“simply” 
by 
improving 
agriculture. 
But 
these 
arguments 
are 
simply 
an 
apology 
for 
imperialism, 
an 
attempt 
to 
embellish 
it, 
because 
they 
ignore 
the 
principal 
feature 
of 
modern 
capitalism: 
monopoly. 
Free 
markets 
are 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
a 
thing 
of 
the 
past; 
monopolist 
syndicates 
and 
trusts 
are 
restricting 
them 
more 
and 
more 
every 
day, 
and 
“simply” 
improving 
agriculture 
reduces 
itself 
to 
improving 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
masses, 
of 
raising 
wages 
and 
reducing 
profits. 
Where, 
except 
in 
the 
imagination 
of 
the 
sentimental 
reformists, 
are 
there 
any 
trusts 
capable 
of 
interesting 
themselves 
in 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
masses 
instead 
of 
the 
conquering 
of 
colonies? 


Finance 
capital 
is 
not 
only 
interested 
in 
the 
already 
known 
sources 
of 
raw 
materials; 
it 
is 
also 
interested 
in 
possible 
sources 
of 
raw 
materials, 
because 
present-day 
technical 
development 
is 
extremely 
rapid, 
and 
because 
land 
which 
is 
useless 
today 
may 
be 
made 
fertile 
tomorrow 
if 
new 
methods 
are 
applied 
(to 
devise 
these 
new 
methods 
a 
big 
bank 
can 
equip 
a 
whole 
expedition 
of 
engineers, 
agricultural 
experts, 
etc.), 
and 
large 
amounts 
of 
capital 
are 
invested. 
This 
also 
applies 
to 
prospecting 
for 
minerals, 
to 
new 
methods 
of 
working 
up 
and 
utilizing 
raw 
materials, 
etc., 
etc. 
Hence, 
the 
inevitable 
striving 
of 
finance 
capital 
to 
extend 
its 
economic 
territory 
and 
even 
its 
territory 
in 
general. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
that 
the 
trusts 
capitalize 
their 
property 
by 
estimating 
it 
at 
two 
or 
three 
times 
its 
value, 
taking 
into 
account 
its 
“possible” 
future 
(and 
not 
present) 
returns, 
and 
the 
further 
results 
of 
monopoly, 
so 
finance 
capital 
strives 
to 
seize 
the 
largest 
possible 
amount 
of 
land 
of 
all 
kinds 
and 
in 
any 
place 
it 
can, 
and 
by 
any 
means, 
counting 
on 
the 
possibilities 
of 
finding 
raw 
materials 
there, 
and 
fearing 
to 
be 
left 
behind 
in 
the 
insensate 
struggle 
for 
the 
last 
available 
scraps 
of 
unappropriated 
territory, 
or 



for 
the 
repartition 
of 
that 
which 
has 
been 
already 
appropriated. 


The 
British 
capitalists 
are 
exerting 
every 
effort 
to 
develop 
cotton 
grown 
in 
their 
own 
Egyptian 
colony 
(in 
1904, 
out 
of 
2,300,000 
hectares 
of 
land 
under 
cultivation, 
600,000, 
or 
more 
than 
one-fourth, 
were 
devoted 
to 
cotton 
growing); 
the 
Russians 
are 
doing 
the 
same 
in 
their 
colony, 
Turkestan; 
and 
they 
are 
doing 
so 
because 
in 
this 
way 
they 
will 
be 
in 
a 
better 
position 
to 
defeat 
their 
foreign 
competitors, 
to 
monopolize 
the 
sources 
of 
raw 
materials 
and 
form 
a 
more 
economical 
and 
profitable 
textile 
trust 
in 
which 
all 
the 
processes 
of 
production 
will 
be 
“combined” 
and 
concentrated 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
a 
single 
owner. 


The 
necessity 
of 
exporting 
capital 
also 
serves 
to 
stimulate 
the 
quest 
for 
colonies, 
for 
it 
is 
easier 
in 
the 
colonial 
market 
(and 
sometimes 
it 
is 
the 
only 
possible 
way), 
by 
monopolist 
methods 
to 
eliminate 
competition, 
to 
make 
sure 
of 
orders, 
to 
strengthen 
the 
necessary 
“connections,” 
etc. 


The 
non-economic 
superstructure 
which 
grows 
up 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
finance 
capital, 
its 
politics 
and 
its 
ideology, 
stimulates 
the 
striving 
for 
colonial 
conquest. 
“Finance 
capital 
does 
not 
want 
liberty, 
it 
wants 
domination,” 
as 
Hilferding 
very 
truly 
says. 
And 
a 
French 
bourgeois 
writer, 
developing 
and 
supplementing, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 
ideas 
of 
Cecil 
Rhodes, 
which 
we 
quoted 
above, 
writes 
that 
social 
causes 
should 
be 
added 
to 
the 
economic 
causes 
of 
modern 
colonial 
policy. 


“Owing 
to 
the 
growing 
complexity 
and 
difficulties 
of 
life 
which 
weigh, 
not 
only 
on 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
workers, 
but 
also 
on 
the 
middle 
classes, 
impatience, 
irritation 
and 
hatred 
are 
accumulating 
in 
all 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
old 
civilization 
and 
are 
becoming 
a 
menace 
to 
public 
order; 
employment 
must 
be 
found 
for 
the 
energy 
which 
is 
being 
hurled 
out 
of 
the 
definite 
class 
channel: 
it 
must 
be 
given 
an 
outlet 
abroad 
in 
order 
to 
avert 
an 
explosion 
at 
home.” 


Since 
we 
are 
speaking 
of 
colonial 
policy 
in 
the 
period 
of 
capitalist 
imperialism, 
it 
must 
be 
observed 
that 
finance 
capital 
and 
its 
corresponding 
foreign 
policy, 
which 
reduces 
itself 
to 
the 
struggle 
of 
the 
Great 
Powers 
for 
the 
economic 
and 
political 
division 
of 
the 
world, 
give 
rise 
to 
a 
number 
of 
transitional 
forms 
of 
national 
dependence. 
The 
division 
of 
the 
world 
into 
two 
principal 
groups—of 
colony-owning 
countries 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
and 
colonies 
on 
the 
other—is 
not 
the 
only 
typical 
feature 
of 
this 
period; 
there 
is 
also 
a 
variety 
of 
forms 
of 
dependence; 
countries 
which, 
formally, 
are 
politically 
independent, 
but 
which 
are, 
in 
fact, 
enmeshed 
in 
the 
net 
of 
financial 
and 



diplomatic 
dependence. 
We 
have 
already 
referred 
to 
one 
form 
of 
dependence 
—the 
semi-colony. 
Another 
example 
is 
provided 
by 
Argentina. 


“South 
America, 
and 
especially 
Argentina,” 
writes 
Schulze-Gavernitz 
in 
his 
work 
on 
British 
imperialism, 
“is 
so 
dependent 
financially 
on 
London 
that 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
described 
as 
almost 
a 
British 
commercial 
colony.” 


Basing 
himself 
on 
the 
report 
of 
the 
Austro-Hungarian 
consul 
at 
Buenos 
Aires, 
Schilder 
estimates 
the 
amount 
of 
British 
capital 
invested 
in 
Argentina 
in 
1909 
at 
8,750,000,000 
francs. 
It 
is 
not 
difficult 
to 
imagine 
the 
solid 
bonds 
that 
are 
thus 
created 
between 
British 
finance 
capital 
(and 
its 
faithful 
“friend,” 
diplomacy) 
and 
the 
Argentine 
bourgeoisie, 
the 
leading 
businessmen 
and 
politicians 
of 
that 
country. 


A 
somewhat 
different 
form 
of 
financial 
and 
diplomatic 
dependence, 
accompanied 
by 
political 
independence, 
is 
presented 
by 
Portugal. 
Portugal 
is 
an 
independent 
sovereign 
state. 
In 
actual 
fact, 
however, 
for 
more 
than 
two 
hundred 
years, 
since 
the 
war 
of 
the 
Spanish 
Succession 
(1700-14), 
it 
has 
been 
a 
British 
protectorate. 
The 
British 
have 
protected 
Portugal 
and 
her 
colonies 
in 
order 
to 
fortify 
their 
own 
positions 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
their 
rivals, 
Spain 
and 
France. 
In 
return, 
they 
have 
received 
commercial 
advantages, 
preferential 
imports 
of 
goods, 
and, 
above 
all, 
of 
capital 
into 
Portugal 
and 
the 
Portuguese 
colonies, 
the 
right 
to 
use 
the 
ports 
and 
islands 
of 
Portugal, 
her 
telegraph 
cables, 
etc. 
Relations 
of 
this 
kind 
have 
always 
existed 
between 
big 
and 
small 
states. 
But 
during 
the 
period 
of 
capitalist 
imperialism 
they 
become 
a 
general 
system, 
they 
form 
part 
of 
the 
process 
of 
“dividing 
the 
world”; 
they 
become 
a 
link 
in 
the 
chain 
of 
operations 
of 
world 
finance 
capital. 


In 
order 
to 
complete 
our 
examination 
of 
the 
question 
of 
the 
division 
of 
the 
world, 
we 
must 
make 
the 
following 
observation. 
This 
question 
was 
raised 
quite 
openly 
and 
definitely 
not 
only 
in 
American 
literature 
after 
the 
Spanish-
American 
War, 
and 
in 
English 
literature 
after 
the 
Boer 
War, 
at 
the 
very 
end 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
and 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
twentieth; 
not 
only 
has 
German 
literature, 
which 
always 
“jealously” 
watches 
“British 
imperialism,” 
systematically 
given 
its 
appraisal 
of 
this 
fact, 
but 
it 
has 
been 
raised 
in 
French 
bourgeois 
literature 
in 
terms 
as 
wide 
and 
as 
clear 
as 
are 
possible 
from 
the 
bourgeois 
point 
of 
view. 
We 
will 
quote 
Driault, 
the 
historian, 
who, 
in 
his 
book, 
Political 
and 
Social 
Problems 
at 
the 
End 
of 
the 
Nineteenth 
Century, 
in 
the 
chapter 
“The 
Great 
Powers 
and 
the 
Division 
of 
the 
World,” 
wrote 
the 
following: 


“During 
recent 
years 
all 
the 
free 
territory 
of 
the 
earth, 
with 
the 
exception 



of 
China, 
has 
been 
occupied 
by 
the 
powers 
of 
Europe 
and 
North 
America. 
Several 
conflicts 
and 
displacements 
of 
influence 
have 
already 
occurred 
over 
this 
matter, 
which 
foreshadow 
more 
terrible 
outbreaks 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
For 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
make 
haste. 
The 
nations 
which 
have 
not 
yet 
made 
provision 
for 
themselves 
run 
the 
risk 
of 
never 
receiving 
their 
share 
and 
never 
participating 
in 
the 
tremendous 
exploitation 
of 
the 
globe 
which 
will 
be 
one 
of 
the 
essential 
features 
of 
the 
next 
century” 
(i.e., 
the 
twentieth). 
“That 
is 
why 
all 
Europe 
and 
America 
has 
lately 
been 
afflicted 
with 
the 
fever 
of 
colonial 
expansion, 
of 
‘imperialism,’ 
that 
most 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
the 
end 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century.” 


And 
the 
author 
added: 


“In 
this 
partition 
of 
the 
world, 
in 
this 
furious 
pursuit 
of 
the 
treasures 
and 
of 
the 
big 
markets 
of 
the 
globe, 
the 
relative 
power 
of 
the 
empires 
founded 
in 
this 
nineteenth 
century 
is 
totally 
out 
of 
proportion 
to 
the 
place 
occupied 
in 
Europe 
by 
the 
nations 
which 
founded 
them. 
The 
dominant 
powers 
in 
Europe, 
those 
which 
decide 
the 
destinies 
of 
the 
Continent, 
are 
not 
equally 
preponderant 
in 
the 
whole 
world. 
And, 
as 
colonial 
power, 
the 
hope 
of 
controlling 
hitherto 
unknown 
wealth, 
will 
obviously 
react 
to 
influence 
the 
relative 
strength 
of 
the 
European 
powers, 
the 
colonial 
question 
—‘imperialism,’ 
if 
you 
will—which 
has 
already 
transformed 
the 
political 
conditions 
of 
Europe, 
will 
modify 
them 
more 
and 
more.” 



Chapter 
Vii 


Imperialism 
As 
A 
Special 
Stage 
Of 
Capitalism 


We 
must 
now 
try 
to 
sum 
up 
and 
put 
together 
what 
has 
been 
said 
above 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
imperialism. 
Imperialism 
emerged 
as 
the 
development 
and 
direct 
continuation 
of 
the 
fundamental 
attributes 
of 
capitalism 
in 
general. 
But 
capitalism 
only 
became 
capitalist 
imperialism 
at 
a 
definite 
and 
very 
high 
stage 
of 
its 
development, 
when 
certain 
of 
its 
fundamental 
attributes 
began 
to 
be 
transformed 
into 
their 
opposites, 
when 
the 
features 
of 
the 
period 
of 
transition 
from 
capitalism 
to 
a 
higher 
social 
and 
economic 
system 
began 
to 
take 
shape 
and 
reveal 
themselves 
all 
along 
the 
line. 
The 
fundamental 
economic 
factor 
in 
this 
process 
is 
the 
substitution 
of 
capitalist 
monopolies 
for 
capitalist 
free 
competition. 
Free 
competition 
is 
the 
fundamental 
attribute 
of 
capitalism 
and 
of 
commodity 
production 
generally. 
Monopoly 
is 
exactly 
the 
opposite 
of 
free 
competition; 
but 
we 
have 
seen 
the 
latter 
being 
transformed 
into 
monopoly 
before 
our 
very 
eyes, 
creating 
large-scale 
industry 
and 
eliminating 
small 
industry, 
replacing 
large-scale 
industry 
by 
still 
larger-scale 
industry, 
finally 
leading 
to 
such 
a 
concentration 
of 
production 
and 
capital 
that 
monopoly 
has 
been 
and 
is 
the 
result: 
cartels, 
syndicates 
and 
trusts, 
and 
merging 
with 
them, 
the 
capital 
of 
a 
dozen 
or 
so 
banks 
manipulating 
thousands 
of 
millions. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
monopoly, 
which 
has 
grown 
out 
of 
free 
competition, 
does 
not 
abolish 
the 
latter, 
but 
exists 
alongside 
it 
and 
hovers 
over 
it, 
as 
it 
were, 
and, 
as 
a 
result, 
gives 
rise 
to 
a 
number 
of 
very 
acute 
antagonisms, 
frictions 
and 
conflicts. 
Monopoly 
is 
the 
transition 
from 
capitalism 
to 
a 
higher 
system. 


If 
it 
were 
necessary 
to 
give 
the 
briefest 
possible 
definition 
of 
imperialism 
we 
should 
have 
to 
say 
that 
imperialism 
is 
the 
monopoly 
stage 
of 
capitalism. 
Such 
a 
definition 
would 
include 
what 
is 
most 
important, 
for, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
finance 
capital 
is 
the 
bank 
capital 
of 
the 
few 
big 
monopolist 
banks, 
merged 
with 
the 
capital 
of 
the 
monopolist 
combines 
of 
manufacturers; 
and, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
division 
of 
the 
world 
is 
the 
transition 
from 
a 
colonial 
policy 
which 
has 
extended 
without 
hindrance 
to 
territories 
unoccupied 
by 
any 
capitalist 
power, 
to 
a 
colonial 
policy 
of 
the 
monopolistic 
possession 
of 
the 
territories 
of 
the 
world 
which 
have 
been 
completely 
divided 
up. 


But 
very 
brief 
definitions, 
although 
convenient, 
for 
they 
sum 
up 
the 
main 



points, 
are 
nevertheless 
inadequate, 
because 
very 
important 
features 
of 
the 
phenomenon 
that 
has 
to 
be 
defined 
have 
to 
be 
especially 
deduced. 
And 
so, 
without 
forgetting 
the 
conditional 
and 
relative 
value 
of 
all 
definitions, 
which 
can 
never 
include 
all 
the 
concatenations 
of 
a 
phenomenon 
in 
its 
complete 
development, 
we 
must 
give 
a 
definition 
of 
imperialism 
that 
will 
embrace 
the 
following 
five 
essential 
features: 


1. 
The 
concentration 
of 
production 
and 
capital 
developed 
to 
such 
a 
stage 
that 
it 
creates 
monopolies 
which 
play 
a 
decisive 
role 
in 
economic 
life. 
2. 
The 
merging 
of 
bank 
capital 
with 
industrial 
capital, 
and 
the 
creation, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
“finance 
capital,” 
of 
a 
financial 
oligarchy. 
3. 
The 
export 
of 
capital, 
which 
has 
become 
extremely 
important, 
as 
distinguished 
from 
the 
export 
of 
commodities. 
4. 
The 
formation 
of 
international 
capitalist 
monopolies 
which 
share 
the 
world 
among 
themselves. 
5. 
The 
territorial 
division 
of 
the 
whole 
world 
among 
the 
greatest 
capitalist 
powers 
is 
completed. 
Imperialism 
is 
capitalism 
in 
that 
stage 
of 
development 
in 
which 
the 
domination 
of 
monopolies 
and 
finance 
capital 
has 
established 
itself; 
in 
which 
the 
export 
of 
capital 
has 
acquired 
pronounced 
importance; 
in 
which 
the 
division 
of 
the 
world 
among 
the 
international 
trusts 
has 
begun; 
in 
which 
the 
partition 
of 
all 
the 
territories 
of 
the 
globe 
among 
the 
great 
capitalist 
powers 
has 
been 
completed. 


We 
shall 
see 
later 
that 
imperialism 
can 
and 
must 
be 
defined 
differently 
if 
consideration 
is 
to 
be 
given, 
not 
only 
to 
the 
basic, 
purely 
economic 
factors— 
to 
which 
the 
above 
definition 
is 
limited—but 
also 
to 
the 
historical 
place 
of 
this 
stage 
of 
capitalism 
in 
relation 
to 
capitalism 
in 
general, 
or 
to 
the 
relations 
between 
imperialism 
and 
the 
two 
main 
tendencies 
in 
the 
working 
class 
movement. 
The 
point 
to 
be 
noted 
just 
now 
is 
that 
imperialism, 
as 
interpreted 
above, 
undoubtedly 
represents 
a 
special 
stage 
in 
the 
development 
of 
capitalism. 
In 
order 
to 
enable 
the 
reader 
to 
obtain 
as 
well 
grounded 
an 
idea 
of 
imperialism 
as 
possible, 
we 
deliberately 
quoted 
largely 
from 
bourgeois 
economists 
who 
are 
obliged 
to 
admit 
the 
particularly 
indisputable 
facts 
regarding 
modern 
capitalist 
economy. 
With 
the 
same 
object 
in 
view, 
we 
have 
produced 
detailed 
statistics 
which 
reveal 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
bank 
capital, 
etc., 
has 
developed, 
showing 
how 
the 
transformation 
of 
quantity 
into 
quality, 
of 
developed 
capitalism 
into 
imperialism, 
has 
expressed 
itself. 
Needless 
to 
say, 
all 
the 
boundaries 
in 
nature 
and 
in 
society 
are 
conditional 
and 



changeable, 
and, 
consequently, 
it 
would 
be 
absurd 
to 
discuss 
the 
exact 
year 
or 
the 
decade 
in 
which 
imperialism 
“definitely” 
became 
established. 


In 
this 
matter 
of 
defining 
imperialism, 
however, 
we 
have 
to 
enter 
into 
controversy, 
primarily, 
with 
Karl 
Kautsky, 
the 
principal 
Marxian 
theoretician 
of 
the 
epoch 
of 
the 
so-called 
Second 
International, 
that 
is, 
of 
the 
twenty-five 
years 
between 
1889 
and 
1914. 


Kautsky, 
in 
1915 
and 
even 
in 
November 
1914, 
decisively 
attacked 
the 
fundamental 
ideas 
expressed 
in 
our 
definition 
of 
imperialism. 
Kautsky 
said 
that 
imperialism 
must 
not 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
“phase” 
or 
stage 
of 
economy, 
but 
as 
a 
policy; 
a 
definite 
policy 
“preferred” 
by 
finance 
capital; 
that 
imperialism 
cannot 
be 
“identified” 
with 
“contemporary 
capitalism”; 
that 
if 
imperialism 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
to 
mean 
“all 
the 
phenomena 
of 
contemporary 
capitalism”— 
cartels, 
protection, 
the 
hegemony 
of 
the 
financiers 
and 
colonial 
policy—— 
then 
the 
question 
as 
to 
whether 
imperialism 
is 
necessary 
for 
capitalism 
becomes 
reduced 
to 
the 
“flattest 
tautology”; 
because, 
in 
that 
case, 
imperialism 
is 
“naturally 
a 
vital 
necessity 
for 
capitalism,” 
and 
so 
on. 
The 
best 
way 
to 
present 
Kautsky’s 
ideas 
is 
to 
quote 
his 
own 
definition 
of 
imperialism, 
which 
is 
diametrically 
opposed 
to 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
ideas 
which 
we 
have 
set 
forth 
(for 
the 
objections 
coming 
from 
the 
camp 
of 
the 
German 
Marxists, 
who 
have 
been 
advocating 
such 
ideas 
for 
many 
years 
already, 
have 
long 
been 
known 
to 
Kautsky 
as 
the 
objections 
of 
a 
definite 
trend 
in 
Marxism). 


Kautsky’s 
definition 
is 
as 
follows: 


“Imperialism 
is 
a 
product 
of 
highly 
developed 
industrial 
capitalism. 
It 
consists 
in 
the 
striving 
of 
every 
industrial 
capitalist 
nation 
to 
bring 
under 
its 
control 
and 
to 
annex 
increasingly 
big 
agrarian” 
(Kautsky’s 
italics) 
“regions 
irrespective 
of 
what 
nations 
inhabit 
those 
regions.” 


This 
definition 
is 
utterly 
worthless 
because 
it 
one-sidedly, 
i.e., 
arbitrarily, 
brings 
out 
the 
national 
question 
alone 
(although 
this 
is 
extremely 
important 
in 
itself 
as 
well 
as 
in 
its 
relation 
to 
imperialism), 
it 
arbitrarily 
and 
inaccurately 
connects 
imperialism 
only 
with 
industrial 
capital 
in 
the 
countries 
which 
annex 
other 
nations 
and 
in 
an 
equally 
arbitrary 
and 
inaccurate 
manner 
brings 
out 
the 
annexation 
of 
agrarian 
regions. 


Imperialism 
is 
a 
striving 
for 
annexations—this 
is 
what 
the 
political 
part 
of 
Kautsky’s 
definition 
amounts 
to. 
It 
is 
correct, 
but 
very 
incomplete, 
for 
politically 
imperialism 
is 
in 
general 
a 
striving 
towards 
violence 
and 
reaction. 
For 
the 
moment, 
however, 
we 
are 
interested 
in 
the 
economic 
aspect 
of 
the 
question, 
which 
Kautsky 
himself 
introduced 
in 
his 
definition. 
The 
inaccuracy 



of 
Kautsky’s 
definition 
is 
obvious. 
The 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
imperialism 
is 
not 
industrial 
capital, 
but 
finance 
capital. 
It 
is 
not 
an 
accident 
that 
in 
France 
it 
was 
precisely 
the 
extraordinarily 
rapid 
development 
of 
finance 
capital 
and 
the 
weakening 
of 
industrial 
capital 
that, 
from 
1880 
onwards, 
gave 
rise 
to 
the 
extreme 
extension 
of 
annexationist 
(colonial) 
policy. 
The 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
imperialism 
is 
precisely 
that 
it 
strives 
to 
annex 
not 
only 
agricultural 
regions, 
but 
even 
highly 
industrialized 
regions 
(German 
appetite 
for 
Belgium; 
French 
appetite 
for 
Lorraine), 
because 
1) 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
world 
is 
already 
partitioned 
obliges 
those 
contemplating 
a 
new 
partition 
to 
stretch 
out 
their 
hands 
to 
any 
kind 
of 
territory, 
and 
2) 
because 
an 
essential 
feature 
of 
imperialism 
is 
the 
rivalry 
between 
a 
number 
of 
great 
powers 
in 
the 
striving 
for 
hegemony, 
i.e., 
for 
the 
conquest 
of 
territory, 
not 
so 
much 
directly 
for 
themselves, 
as 
to 
weaken 
the 
adversary 
and 
undermine 
his 
hegemony. 
(Belgium 
is 
chiefly 
necessary 
for 
Germany 
as 
a 
base 
for 
operations 
against 
England; 
England 
needs 
Bagdad 
as 
a 
base 
for 
operations 
against 
Germany, 
etc.) 


Kautsky 
refers 
especially—and 
repeatedly—to 
English 
writers 
who, 
he 
alleges, 
have 
given 
a 
purely 
political 
meaning 
to 
the 
word 
“imperialism” 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
Kautsky 
understands 
it. 
We 
take 
up 
the 
work 
by 
the 
Englishman 
Hobson, 
Imperialism, 
which 
appeared 
in 
1902, 
and 
therein 
we 
read: 


“The 
new 
imperialism 
differs 
from 
the 
older, 
first 
in 
substituting 
for 
the 
ambition 
of 
a 
single 
growing 
empire 
the 
theory 
and 
the 
practice 
of 
competing 
empires, 
each 
motivated 
by 
similar 
lusts 
of 
political 
aggrandisement 
and 
commercial 
gain, 
secondly, 
in 
the 
dominance 
of 
financial, 
or 
investing, 
over 
mercantile 
interests.” 


We 
see, 
therefore, 
that 
Kautsky 
is 
absolutely 
wrong 
in 
referring 
to 
English 
writers 
generally 
(unless 
he 
meant 
the 
vulgar 
British 
imperialist 
writers, 
or 
the 
avowed 
apologists 
for 
imperialism). 
We 
see 
that 
Kautsky, 
while 
claiming 
that 
he 
continues 
to 
defend 
Marxism, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
takes 
a 
step 
backward 
compared 
with 
the 
social-liberal 
Hobson, 
who 
more 
correctly 
takes 
into 
account 
two 
“historically 
concrete” 
(Kautsky’s 
definition 
is 
a 
mockery 
of 
historical 
concreteness) 
features 
of 
modern 
imperialism: 
1) 
the 
competition 
between 
several 
imperialisms, 
and 
2) 
the 
predominance 
of 
the 
financier 
over 
the 
merchant. 
If 
it 
were 
chiefly 
a 
question 
of 
the 
annexation 
of 
agrarian 
countries 
by 
industrial 
countries, 
the 
role 
of 
the 
merchant 
would 
be 
predominant. 



But 
Kautsky’s 
definition 
is 
not 
only 
wrong 
and 
un-Marxian. 
It 
serves 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
a 
whole 
system 
of 
views 
which 
run 
counter 
to 
Marxian 
theory 
and 
Marxian 
practice 
all 
along 
the 
line. 
We 
shall 
refer 
to 
this 
again 
later. 
The 
argument 
about 
words 
which 
Kautsky 
raises: 
whether 
the 
latest 
stage 
of 
capitalism 
should 
be 
called 
“imperialism” 
or 
“the 
stage 
of 
finance 
capital” 
is 
of 
no 
importance. 
Call 
it 
what 
you 
will, 
it 
matters 
little. 
The 
important 
fact 
is 
that 
Kautsky 
detaches 
the 
politics 
of 
imperialism 
from 
its 
economics, 
speaks 
of 
annexations 
as 
being 
a 
policy 
“preferred” 
by 
finance 
capital, 
and 
opposes 
to 
it 
another 
bourgeois 
policy 
which 
he 
alleges 
is 
possible 
on 
this 
very 
basis 
of 
finance 
capital. 
According 
to 
his 
argument, 
monopolies 
in 
economics 
are 
compatible 
with 
non-monopolistic, 
non-violent, 
non-annexationist 
methods 
in 
politics. 
According 
to 
his 
argument, 
the 
territorial 
division 
of 
the 
world, 
which 
was 
completed 
precisely 
during 
the 
period 
of 
finance 
capital, 
and 
which 
constitutes 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
present 
peculiarities 
of 
the 
form 
of 
rivalry 
between 
the 
biggest 
capitalist 
states, 
is 
compatible 
with 
a 
non-imperialist 
policy. 
The 
result 
is 
a 
slurring 
over 
and 
a 
blunting 
of 
the 
most 
profound 
contradictions 
of 
the 
latest 
stage 
of 
capitalism, 
instead 
of 
an 
exposure 
of 
their 
depth. 
The 
result 
is 
bourgeois 
reformism 
instead 
of 
Marxism. 


Kautsky 
enters 
into 
controversy 
with 
the 
German 
apologist 
of 
imperialism 
and 
annexations, 
Cuno, 
who 
clumsily 
and 
cynically 
argues 
as 
follows: 
imperialism 
is 
modern 
capitalism, 
the 
development 
of 
capitalism 
is 
inevitable 
and 
progressive; 
therefore 
imperialism 
is 
progressive; 
therefore 
we 
should 
bow 
down 
before 
it 
and 
chant 
its 
praises. 
This 
is 
something 
like 
the 
caricature 
of 
Russian 
Marxism 
which 
the 
Narodniki 
drew 
in 
1894-95. 
They 
used 
to 
argue 
as 
follows: 
if 
the 
Marxists 
believe 
that 
capitalism 
is 
inevitable 
in 
Russia, 
that 
it 
is 
progressive, 
then 
they 
ought 
to 
open 
a 
public-house 
and 
begin 
to 
implant 
capitalism! 
Kautsky’s 
reply 
to 
Cuno 
is 
as 
follows: 
imperialism 
is 
not 
modern 
capitalism. 
It 
is 
only 
one 
of 
the 
forms 
of 
the 
policy 
of 
modern 
capitalism. 
This 
policy 
we 
can 
and 
should 
fight; 
we 
can 
and 
should 
fight 
against 
imperialism, 
annexations, 
etc. 


The 
reply 
seems 
quite 
plausible, 
but 
in 
effect 
it 
is 
a 
more 
subtle 
and 
more 
disguised 
(and 
therefore 
more 
dangerous) 
form 
of 
propaganda 
of 
conciliation 
with 
imperialism, 
for 
unless 
it 
strikes 
at 
the 
economic 
basis 
of 
the 
trusts 
and 
banks, 
the 
“struggle” 
against 
the 
policy 
of 
the 
trusts 
and 
banks 
reduces 
itself 
to 
bourgeois 
reformism 
and 
pacifism, 
to 
an 
innocent 
and 
benevolent 
expression 
of 
pious 
hopes. 
Kautsky’s 
theory 
means 
refraining 
from 
mentioning 
existing 
contradictions, 
forgetting 
the 
most 
important 
of 
them, 



instead 
of 
revealing 
them 
in 
their 
full 
depth; 
it 
is 
a 
theory 
that 
has 
nothing 
in 
common 
with 
Marxism. 
Naturally, 
such 
a 
“theory” 
can 
only 
serve 
the 
purpose 
of 
advocating 
unity 
with 
the 
Cunos. 
Kautsky 
writes 
that 
from 
the 
purely 
economic 
point 
of 
view 
it 
is 
not 
impossible 
that 
capitalism 
will 
yet 
go 
through 
a 
new 
phase, 
that 
of 
the 
extension 
of 
the 
policy 
of 
the 
cartels 
to 
foreign 
policy, 
the 
phase 
of 
ultra-imperialism, 
i.e., 
of 
a 
super-imperialism, 
a 
union 
of 
world 
imperialism 
and 
not 
struggles 
among 
imperialisms; 
a 
phase 
when 
wars 
shall 
cease 
under 
capitalism, 
a 
phase 
of 
“the 
joint 
exploitation 
of 
the 
world 
by 
internationally 
united 
finance 
capital.” 


We 
shall 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
this 
“theory 
of 
ultra-imperialism” 
later 
on 
in 
order 
to 
show 
how 
definitely 
and 
utterly 
it 
departs 
from 
Marxism. 
In 
keeping 
with 
the 
plan 
of 
the 
present 
work, 
we 
shall 
examine 
the 
exact 
economic 
data 
on 
this 
question. 
Is 
“ultra-imperialism” 
possible 
“from 
the 
purely 
economic 
point 
of 
view” 
or 
is 
it 
ultra-nonsense? 


If, 
by 
“purely 
economic 
point 
of 
view” 
a 
“pure” 
abstraction 
is 
meant, 
then 
all 
that 
can 
be 
said 
reduces 
itself 
to 
the 
following 
proposition: 
evolution 
is 
proceeding 
towards 
monopoly; 
therefore 
the 
trend 
is 
towards 
a 
single 
world 
monopoly, 
to 
a 
universal 
trust. 
This 
is 
indisputable, 
but 
it 
is 
also 
as 
completely 
devoid 
of 
meaning 
as 
is 
the 
statement 
that 
“evolution 
is 
proceeding” 
towards 
the 
manufacture 
of 
food-stuffs 
in 
laboratories. 
In 
this 
sense 
the 
“theory” 
of 
ultra-imperialism 
is 
no 
less 
absurd 
than 
a 
“theory 
of 
ultra-agriculture” 
would 
be, 
if 
one 
were 
suggested. 


If, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
we 
are 
discussing 
the 
“purely 
economic” 
conditions 
of 
the 
epoch 
of 
finance 
capital 
as 
a 
historically 
concrete 
epoch 
in 
the 
twentieth 
century, 
the 
best 
reply 
that 
one 
can 
make 
to 
lifeless 
abstractions 
of 
“ultra-imperialism” 
(which 
serve 
an 
exclusively 
reactionary 
aim, 
viz., 
that 
of 
diverting 
attention 
from 
the 
depth 
of 
existing 
antagonisms) 
is 
to 
contrast 
them 
with 
the 
concrete 
economic 
realities 
of 
present-day 
world 
economy. 
Kautsky’s 
meaningless 
talk 
about 
ultra-imperialism 
encourages, 
among 
other 
things, 
that 
profoundly 
mistaken 
idea 
which 
only 
brings 
grist 
to 
the 
mill 
of 
the 
apologists 
of 
imperialism, 
viz., 
that 
the 
domination 
of 
finance 
capital 
lessens 
the 
unevenness 
and 
contradictions 
inherent 
in 
world 
economy, 
whereas 
in 
reality 
it 
increases 
them. 


Richard 
Calwer, 
in 
his 
little 
book, 
An 
Introduction 
to 
World 
Economics, 
attempted 
to 
compile 
the 
main, 
purely 
economic 
data 
required 
to 
depict 
in 
a 
concrete 
way 
the 
internal 
relations 
of 
world 
economy 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
and 
beginning 
of 
the 
twentieth 
centuries. 
He 
divides 
the 
world 
into 



five 
“main 
economic 
areas,” 
as 
follows: 
1) 
Central 
Europe 
(the 
whole 
of 
Europe 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
Russia 
and 
Great 
Britain); 
2) 
Great 
Britain; 
3) 
Russia; 
4) 
Eastern 
Asia; 
5) 
America; 
he 
includes 
the 
colonies 
in 
the 
“areas” 
of 
the 
state 
to 
which 
they 
belong 
and 
“leaves 
out” 
a 
few 
countries 
not 
distributed 
according 
to 
areas, 
such 
as 
Persia, 
Afghanistan 
and 
Arabia 
in 
Asia; 
Morocco 
and 
Abyssinia 
in 
Africa, 
etc. 


Here 
is 
a 
brief 
summary 
of 
the 
economic 
data 
he 
quotes 
on 
these 
regions: 


We 
notice 
three 
areas 
of 
highly 
developed 
capitalism, 
that 
is, 
with 
a 
high 
development 
of 
means 
of 
transport, 
of 
trade 
and 
of 
industry. 
These 
are 
the 
Central 
European, 
the 
British 
and 
the 
American 
areas. 
Among 
these 
are 
three 
states 
which 
dominate 
the 
world: 
Germany, 
Great 
Britain, 
the 
United 
States. 
Imperialist 
rivalry 
and 
the 
struggle 
between 
these 
countries 
have 
become 
very 
keen 
because 
Germany 
has 
only 
a 
restricted 
area 
and 
few 
colonies 
(the 
creation 
of 
“central 
Europe” 
is 
still 
a 
matter 
for 
the 
future; 
it 
is 
being 
born 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
desperate 
struggles). 
For 
the 
moment 
the 
distinctive 
feature 
of 
Europe 
is 
political 
disintegration. 
In 
the 
British 
and 
American 
areas, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
political 
concentration 
is 
very 
highly 
developed, 
but 
there 
is 
a 
tremendous 
disparity 
between 
the 
immense 
colonies 
of 
the 
one 
and 
the 
insignificant 
colonies 
of 
the 
other. 
In 
the 
colonies, 
capitalism 
is 
only 
beginning 
to 
develop. 
The 
struggle 
for 
South 
America 
is 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
acute. 


There 
are 
two 
areas 
where 
capitalism 
is 
not 
strongly 
developed: 
Russia 
and 
Eastern 
Asia. 
In 
the 
former 
the 
density 
of 
population 
is 
very 
small, 
in 
the 
latter 
it 
is 
very 
high; 
in 
the 
former 
political 
concentration 
is 
very 
high; 
in 
the 
latter 
it 
does 
not 
exist. 
The 
partition 
of 
China 
is 
only 
beginning, 
and 
the 
struggle 
between 
Japan, 
U.S.A., 
etc., 
in 
connection 
therewith 
is 
steadily 
gaining 
in 
intensity. 


Compare 
this 
reality, 
the 
vast 
diversity 
of 
economic 
and 
political 
conditions, 
the 
extreme 
disparity 
in 
the 
rate 
of 
development 
of 
the 
various 
countries, 
and 
the 
violent 
struggles 
of 
the 
imperialist 
states, 
with 
Kautsky’s 
stupid 
little 
fable 
about 
“peaceful” 
ultra-imperialism. 
Is 
this 
not 
the 
reactionary 
attempt 
of 
a 
frightened 
philistine 
to 
hide 
from 
stern 
reality? 
Do 
not 
the 
international 
cartels 
which 
Kautsky 
imagines 
are 
the 
embryos 
of 
“ultra-imperialism” 
(with 
as 
much 
reason 
as 
one 
would 
have 
for 
describing 
the 
manufacture 
of 
tabloids 
in 
a 
laboratory 
as 
ultra-agriculture 
in 
embryo) 
present 
an 
example 
of 
the 
division 
and 
the 
re-division 
of 
the 
world, 
the 
transition 
from 
peaceful 
division 
to 
violent 
division 
and 
vice 
versa? 
Is 
not 



American 
and 
other 
finance 
capital, 
which 
divide 
the 
whole 
world 
peacefully, 
with 
Germany’s 
participation, 
for 
example, 
in 
the 
International 
Rail 
Syndicate, 
or 
in 
the 
International 
Mercantile 
Shipping 
Trust, 
now 
engaged 
in 
re-dividing 
the 
world 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
new 
relation 
of 
forces, 
which 
has 
been 
changed 
by 
methods 
by 
no 
means 
peaceful? 


Finance 
capital 
and 
the 
trusts 
are 
aggravating 
instead 
of 
diminishing 
the 
differences 
in 
the 
rate 
of 
development 
of 
the 
various 
parts 
of 
world 
economy. 
When 
the 
relation 
of 
forces 
is 
very 
highly 
developed, 
but 
there 
is 
a 
tremendous 
disparity 
contradictions 
be 
found, 
except 
by 
resorting 
to 
violence? 


Railway 
statistics 
provide 
remarkably 
exact 
data 
on 
the 
different 
rates 
of 
development 
of 
capitalism 
and 
finance 
capital 
in 
world 
economy. 
In 
the 
last 
decades 
of 
imperialist 
development, 
the 
total 
length 
of 
railways, 
expressed 
in 
thousands 
of 
kilometers, 
has 
changed 
as 
follows: 


Thus, 
the 
development 
of 
railways 
has 
been 
more 
rapid 
in 
the 
colonies 
and 
in 
the 
independent 
or 
semi-independent 
states 
of 
Asia 
and 
America. 
Here, 
as 
we 
know, 
the 
finance 
capital 
of 
the 
four 
or 
five 
biggest 
capitalist 
states 
reigns 
undisputed. 
Two 
hundred 
thousand 
kilometers 
of 
new 
railways 
in 
the 
colonies 
and 
in 
the 
other 
countries 
of 
Asia 
and 
America 
represent 
more 
than 
40,000,000,000 
marks 
in 
capital, 
newly 
invested 
under 
particularly 
advantageous 
conditions, 
with 
special 
guarantees 
of 
a 
good 
return 
and 
with 
profitable 
orders 
for 
steel 
works, 
etc., 
etc. 


Capitalism 
is 
growing 
with 
the 
greatest 
rapidity 
in 
the 
colonies 
and 
in 
trans-oceanic 
countries. 
Among 
the 
latter, 
new 
imperialist 
powers 
are 
emerging 
(e.g., 
Japan). 
The 
struggle 
of 
world 
imperialism 
is 
becoming 
aggravated. 
The 
tribute 
levied 
by 
finance 
capital 
on 
the 
most 
profitable 
colonial 
and 
trans-oceanic 
enterprises 
is 
increasing. 
In 
sharing 
out 
this 
booty, 
an 
exceptionally 
large 
part 
goes 
to 
countries 
which, 
as 
far 
as 
the 
development 
of 
productive 
forces 
is 
concerned, 
do 
not 
always 
stand 
at 
the 
top 
of 
the 
list. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
biggest 
countries, 
considered 
with 
their 
colonies, 
the 
total 
length 
of 
railways 
was 
as 
follows 
(in 
thousands 
of 
kilometers): 


Thus, 
about 
80 
per 
cent 
of 
the 
total 
existing 
railways 
are 
concentrated 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
five 
great 
powers. 
But 
the 
concentration 
of 
the 
ownership 
of 
these 
railways, 
that 
of 
finance 
capital, 
is 
much 
greater 
still: 
French 
and 
English 
millionaires, 
for 
example, 
own 
an 
enormous 
amount 
of 
stocks 
and 
bonds 
in 
American, 
Russian 
and 
other 
railways. 


Thanks 
to 
her 
colonies, 
Great 
Britain 
has 
increased 
“her” 
length 
of 



railways 
by 
100,000 
kilometers, 
four 
times 
as 
much 
as 
Germany. 
And 
yet 
it 
is 
well 
known 
that 
the 
development 
of 
productive 
forces 
in 
Germany, 
and 
especially 
the 
development 
of 
the 
coal 
and 
iron 
industries, 
has 
been 
much 
more 
rapid 
during 
this 
period 
than 
in 
England—not 
to 
mention 
France 
and 
Russia. 
In 
1892, 
Germany 
produced 
4,900,000 
tons 
of 
pig 
iron, 
and 
Great 
Britain 
produced 
6,800,000 
tons; 
in 
1912, 
German 
produced 
17,600,000 
tons 
and 
Great 
Britain, 
9,000,000 
tons. 
Germany, 
therefore, 
had 
an 
overwhelming 
superiority 
over 
England 
in 
this 
respect! 


We 
ask, 
is 
there 
under 
capitalism 
any 
means 
of 
remedying 
the 
disparity 
between 
the 
development 
of 
productive 
forces 
and 
the 
accumulation 
of 
capital 
on 
the 
one 
side, 
and 
the 
division 
of 
colonies 
and 
“spheres 
of 
influence” 
by 
finance 
capital 
on 
the 
other 
side—other 
than 
by 
resorting 
to 
war? 



Chapter 
Viii 


The 
Parasitism 
And 
Decay 
Of 
Capitalism 


We 
have 
to 
examine 
yet 
another 
very 
important 
aspect 
of 
imperialism 
to 
which, 
usually, 
too 
little 
importance 
is 
attached 
in 
most 
of 
the 
arguments 
on 
this 
subject. 
One 
of 
the 
shortcomings 
of 
the 
Marxist, 
Hilferding, 
is 
that 
he 
takes 
a 
step 
backward 
compared 
with 
the 
non-Marxist, 
Hobson. 
We 
refer 
to 
parasitism, 
which 
is 
a 
feature 
of 
imperialism. 


As 
we 
have 
seen, 
the 
most 
deep-rooted 
economic 
foundation 
of 
imperialism 
is 
monopoly. 
This 
is 
capitalist 
monopoly, 
i.e., 
monopoly 
which 
has 
grown 
out 
of 
capitalism 
and 
exists 
in 
the 
general 
capitalist 
environment 
of 
commodity 
production 
and 
competition, 
and 
remains 
in 
permanent 
and 
insoluble 
contradiction 
to 
this 
general 
environment. 
Nevertheless, 
like 
all 
monopoly, 
this 
capitalist 
monopoly 
inevitably 
gives 
rise 
to 
a 
tendency 
to 
stagnation 
and 
decay. 
As 
monopoly 
prices 
become 
fixed, 
even 
temporarily, 
the 
stimulus 
to 
technical 
and, 
consequently, 
to 
all 
progress, 
disappears 
to 
a 
certain 
extent, 
and 
to 
that 
extent, 
also, 
the 
economic 
possibility 
arises 
of 
deliberately 
retarding 
technical 
progress. 
For 
instance, 
in 
America, 
a 
certain 
Mr. 
Owens 
invented 
a 
machine 
which 
revolutionized 
the 
manufacture 
of 
bottles. 
The 
German 
bottle 
manufacturing 
trust 
purchased 
Owens’ 
patent, 
but 
refrained 
from 
utilizing 
it. 
Certainly, 
monopoly 
cannot, 
under 
capitalism, 
eliminate 
competition 
in 
the 
world 
market 
completely 
and 
for 
a 
long 
period 
of 
time 
(and 
this, 
by 
the 
by, 
is 
one 
of 
the 
reasons 
why 
the 
theory 
of 
ultra-
imperialism 
is 
so 
absurd). 
Certainly 
the 
possibility 
of 
reducing 
cost 
of 
production 
and 
increasing 
profits 
by 
introducing 
technical 
improvements 
is 
an 
influence 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
change. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
tendency 
to 
stagnation 
and 
decay, 
which 
is 
the 
feature 
of 
monopoly, 
continues, 
and 
in 
certain 
branches 
of 
industry, 
in 
certain 
countries, 
for 
certain 
periods 
of 
time, 
it 
becomes 
predominant. 


The 
monopoly 
of 
ownership 
of 
very 
extensive, 
rich 
or 
well-situated 
colonies 
operates 
in 
the 
same 
direction. 


Moreover, 
imperialism 
is 
an 
immense 
accumulation 
of 
money 
capital 
in 
a 
few 
countries, 
which, 
as 
we 
have 
seen, 
amounts 
to 
100 
to 
150 
billion 
francs 
in 
various 
securities. 
Hence 
the 
extraordinary 
growth 
of 
the 
class, 
or 
rather 
of 
the 
category, 
of 
bondholders 
(rentiers), 
people 
who 
live 
by 
clipping 
coupons, 



who 
take 
no 
part 
whatever 
in 
production, 
whose 
profession 
is 
idleness. 
The 
export 
of 
capital, 
one 
of 
the 
essential 
economic 
bases 
of 
imperialism, 
still 
more 
completely 
isolates 
the 
rentiers 
from 
production 
and 
sets 
the 
seal 
of 
parasitism 
on 
the 
whole 
country 
that 
lives 
by 
the 
exploitation 
of 
the 
labor 
of 
several 
overseas 
countries 
and 
colonies. 


“In 
1893,” 
writes 
Hobson, 
“the 
British 
capital 
invested 
abroad 
represented 
about 
15 
per 
cent 
of 
the 
total 
wealth 
of 
the 
United 
Kingdom.” 


Let 
us 
remember 
that 
by 
1915 
this 
capital 
had 
increased 
about 
two 
and 
a 
half 
times. 


“Aggressive 
imperialism,” 
says 
Hobson 
further 
on, 
“which 
costs 
the 
taxpayer 
so 
dear, 
which 
is 
of 
so 
little 
value 
to 
the 
manufacturer 
and 
trader 
... 
is 
a 
source 
of 
great 
gain 
to 
the 
investor.... 
The 
annual 
income 
Great 
Britain 
derives 
from 
commissions 
in 
her 
whole 
foreign 
and 
colonial 
trade, 
import 
and 
export, 
is 
estimated 
by 
Sir 
R. 
Giffen 
at 
£18,000,000 
for 
1899, 
taken 
at 


2.5 
per 
cent 
upon 
a 
turnover 
of 
£800,000,000.” 
Great 
as 
this 
sum 
is, 
it 
does 
not 
explain 
the 
aggressive 
imperialism 
of 
Great 
Britain. 
This 
is 
explained 
by 
the 
90 
to 
100 
million 
pounds 
sterling 
revenue 
from 
“invested” 
capital, 
the 
income 
of 
the 
rentier 
class. 


The 
revenue 
of 
the 
bondholders 
is 
five 
times 
greater 
than 
the 
revenue 
obtained 
from 
the 
foreign 
trade 
of 
the 
greatest 
trading 
country 
in 
the 
world. 
This 
is 
the 
essence 
of 
imperialism 
and 
imperialist 
parasitism. 


For 
that 
reason 
the 
term, 
“bondholder 
state” 
(Rentner-staat 
), 
or 
usurer 
state, 
is 
passing 
into 
current 
use 
in 
the 
economic 
literature 
that 
deals 
with 
imperialism. 
The 
world 
has 
become 
divided 
into 
a 
handful 
of 
money-lending 
states 
on 
the 
one 
side, 
and 
a 
vast 
majority 
of 
debtor 
states 
on 
the 
other. 


“The 
premier 
place 
among 
foreign 
investments,” 
says 
Schulze-Gavernitz, 
“is 
held 
by 
those 
placed 
in 
politically 
dependent 
or 
closely 
allied 
countries. 
Great 
Britain 
grants 
loans 
to 
Egypt, 
Japan, 
China 
and 
South 
America. 
Her 
navy 
plays 
the 
part 
of 
bailiff 
in 
case 
of 
necessity. 
Great 
Britain’s 
political 
power 
protects 
her 
from 
the 
indignation 
of 
her 
debtors.” 


Sartorius 
von 
Waltershausen 
in 
his 
work, 
The 
Economic 
System 
of 
Foreign 
Investments, 
cites 
Holland 
as 
the 
model 
bondholder 
state 
and 
points 
out 
that 
Great 
Britain 
and 
France 
have 
taken 
the 
same 
road. 
Schilder 
believes 
that 
five 
industrial 
nations 
have 
become 
“pronounced 
creditor 
nations”; 
Great 
Britain, 
France, 
Germany, 
Belgium 
and 
Switzerland. 
Holland 
does 
not 
appear 
on 
this 
list 
simply 
because 
it 
is 
“industrially 
less 
developed.” 
He 
asserts 
that 
the 
United 
States 
is 
creditor 
only 
of 
the 
other 
American 
countries. 



“Great 
Britain,” 
says 
Schulze-Gävernitz, 
“is 
gradually 
becoming 
transformed 
from 
an 
industrial 
state 
into 
a 
creditor 
state. 
Notwithstanding 
the 
absolute 
increase 
in 
industrial 
output 
and 
the 
export 
of 
manufactured 
goods, 
the 
relative 
importance 
of 
income 
from 
interest 
and 
dividends, 
issues, 
commissions 
and 
speculation 
is 
on 
the 
increase 
for 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
national 
economy. 
In 
my 
opinion 
it 
is 
precisely 
this 
that 
forms 
the 
economic 
basis 
of 
imperialist 
ascendancy. 
The 
creditor 
is 
more 
permanently 
attached 
to 
the 
debtor 
than 
the 
seller 
is 
to 
the 
buyer.” 


In 
regard 
to 
Germany, 
A. 
Lansburgh, 
the 
editor 
of 
Die 
Bank, 
in 
1911, 
in 
an 
article 
entitled 
“Germany 
as 
a 
Bondholder 
State,” 
wrote 
the 
following: 


“People 
in 
Germany 
are 
ready 
to 
sneer 
at 
the 
yearning 
observed 
in 
France 
of 
people 
to 
become 
rentiers. 
But 
they 
forget 
that 
as 
far 
as 
the 
middle 
class 
is 
concerned 
the 
situation 
in 
Germany 
is 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
like 
that 
in 
France.” 


The 
rentier 
state 
is 
a 
state 
of 
parasitic 
decaying 
capitalism, 
and 
this 
circumstance 
cannot 
fail 
to 
influence 
all 
the 
social-political 
conditions 
of 
the 
countries 
affected 
generally 
and 
the 
two 
fundamental 
trends 
in 
the 
working 
class 
movement 
particularly. 
To 
demonstrate 
this 
in 
the 
clearest 
possible 
manner 
we 
will 
quote 
Hobson, 
who 
will 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
more 
“reliable” 
witness, 
since 
he 
cannot 
be 
suspected 
of 
leanings 
towards 
“orthodox 
Marxism”; 
moreover, 
he 
is 
an 
Englishman 
who 
is 
very 
well 
acquainted 
with 
the 
situation 
in 
the 
country 
which 
is 
richest 
in 
colonies, 
in 
finance 
capital 
and 
in 
imperialist 
experience. 


With 
the 
Boer 
War 
fresh 
in 
his 
mind, 
Hobson 
describes 
the 
connection 
between 
imperialism, 
and 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
“financiers,” 
the 
growing 
profits 
from 
war 
contracts, 
etc., 
and 
writes 
as 
follows: 


“While 
the 
directors 
of 
this 
definitely 
parasitic 
policy 
are 
capitalists, 
the 
same 
motives 
appeal 
to 
special 
classes 
of 
the 
workers. 
In 
many 
towns, 
most 
important 
trades 
are 
dependent 
upon 
government 
employment 
or 
contracts; 
the 
imperialism 
of 
the 
metal 
and 
shipbuilding 
centers 
is 
attributable 
in 
no 
small 
degree 
to 
this 
fact.” 


In 
this 
writer’s 
opinion 
there 
are 
two 
causes 
which 
weakened 
the 
older 
empires: 
1) 
“economic 
parasitism,” 
and 
2) 
the 
formation 
of 
armies 
composed 
of 
subject 
races. 


“There 
is 
first 
the 
habit 
of 
economic 
parasitism, 
by 
which 
the 
ruling 
state 
has 
used 
its 
provinces, 
colonies 
and 
dependencies, 
in 
order 
to 
enrich 
its 
ruling 
class 
and 
to 
bribe 
its 
lower 
classes 
into 
acquiescence.” 



And 
we 
would 
add 
that 
the 
economic 
possibility 
of 
such 
corruption, 
whatever 
its 
form 
may 
be, 
requires 
high 
monopolist 
profits. 


As 
for 
the 
second 
cause, 
Hobson 
writes: 


“One 
of 
the 
strangest 
symptoms 
of 
the 
blindness 
of 
imperialism 
is 
the 
reckless 
indifference 
with 
which 
Great 
Britain, 
France 
and 
other 
imperialist 
nations 
are 
embarking 
on 
this 
perilous 
dependence. 
Great 
Britain 
has 
gone 
farthest. 
Most 
of 
the 
fighting 
by 
which 
we 
have 
won 
our 
Indian 
Empire 
has 
been 
done 
by 
natives; 
in 
India, 
as 
more 
recently 
in 
Egypt, 
great 
standing 
armies 
are 
placed 
under 
British 
commanders; 
almost 
all 
the 
fighting 
associated 
with 
our 
African 
dominions, 
except 
in 
the 
southern 
part, 
has 
been 
done 
for 
us 
by 
natives.” 


Hobson 
gives 
the 
following 
economic 
appraisal 
of 
the 
prospect 
of 
the 
partition 
of 
China: 


“The 
greater 
part 
of 
Western 
Europe 
might 
then 
assume 
the 
appearance 
and 
character 
already 
exhibited 
by 
tracts 
of 
country 
in 
the 
South 
of 
England, 
in 
the 
Riviera, 
and 
in 
the 
tourist-ridden 
or 
residential 
parts 
of 
Italy 
and 
Switzerland, 
little 
clusters 
of 
wealthy 
aristocrats 
drawing 
dividends 
and 
pensions 
from 
the 
Far 
East, 
with 
a 
somewhat 
larger 
group 
of 
professional 
retainers 
and 
tradesmen 
and 
a 
large 
body 
of 
personal 
servants 
and 
workers 
in 
the 
transport 
trade 
and 
in 
the 
final 
stages 
of 
production 
of 
the 
more 
perishable 
goods; 
all 
the 
main 
arterial 
industries 
would 
have 
disappeared, 
the 
staple 
foods 
and 
manufactures 
flowing 
in 
as 
tribute 
from 
Asia 
and 
Africa. 


“We 
have 
foreshadowed 
the 
possibility 
of 
even 
a 
larger 
alliance 
of 
Western 
states, 
a 
European 
federation 
of 
great 
powers 
which, 
so 
far 
from 
forwarding 
the 
cause 
of 
world 
civilization, 
might 
introduce 
the 
gigantic 
peril 
of 
a 
Western 
parasitism, 
a 
group 
of 
advanced 
industrial 
nations, 
whose 
upper 
classes 
draw 
vast 
tribute 
from 
Asia 
and 
Africa, 
with 
which 
they 
support 
great 
tame 
masses 
of 
retainers, 
no 
longer 
engaged 
in 
the 
staple 
industries 
of 
agriculture 
and 
manufacture, 
but 
kept 
in 
the 
performance 
of 
personal 
or 
minor 
industrial 
services 
under 
the 
control 
of 
a 
new 
financial 
aristocracy. 
Let 
those 
who 
would 
scout 
such 
a 
theory 
as 
undeserving 
of 
consideration 
examine 
the 
economic 
and 
social 
condition 
of 
districts 
in 
Southern 
England 
today, 
which 
are 
already 
reduced 
to 
this 
condition, 
and 
reflect 
upon 
the 
vast 
extension 
of 
such 
a 
system 
which 
might 
be 
rendered 
feasible 
by 
the 
subjection 
of 
China 
to 
the 
economic 
control 
of 
similar 
groups 
of 
financiers, 
investors, 
and 
political 
and 
business 
officials, 
draining 
the 
greatest 
potential 
reservoir 
of 
profit 
the 
world 
has 
ever 
known, 
in 
order 
to 
consume 
it 
in 



Europe. 
The 
situation 
is 
far 
too 
complex, 
the 
play 
of 
world 
forces 
far 
too 
incalculable, 
to 
render 
this 
or 
any 
other 
single 
interpretation 
of 
the 
future 
very 
probable; 
but 
the 
influences 
which 
govern 
the 
imperialism 
of 
Western 
Europe 
today 
are 
moving 
in 
this 
direction 
and, 
unless 
counteracted 
or 
diverted, 
make 
towards 
some 
such 
consummation.” 


Hobson 
is 
quite 
right. 
Unless 
the 
forces 
of 
imperialism 
are 
counteracted 
they 
will 
lead 
to 
what 
he 
has 
described. 
He 
correctly 
appraises 
the 
significance 
of 
a 
“United 
States 
of 
Europe,” 
in 
the 
present 
conditions 
of 
imperialism. 
He 
should 
have 
added, 
however, 
that, 
even 
within 
the 
working 
class 
movement, 
the 
opportunists, 
who 
are 
for 
the 
moment 
predominant 
in 
most 
countries, 
are 
“working” 
systematically 
and 
undeviatingly 
in 
this 
very 
direction. 
Imperialism, 
which 
means 
the 
partition 
of 
the 
world, 
and 
the 
exploitation 
of 
other 
countries 
besides 
China, 
which 
means 
high 
monopoly 
profits 
for 
a 
handful 
of 
very 
rich 
countries, 
creates 
the 
economic 
possibility 
of 
corrupting 
the 
upper 
strata 
of 
the 
proletariat, 
and 
thereby 
fosters, 
gives 
form 
to, 
and 
strengthens 
opportunism. 
However, 
we 
must 
not 
lose 
sight 
of 
the 
forces 
which 
counteract 
imperialism 
generally, 
and 
opportunism 
particularly, 
which, 
naturally, 
the 
social-liberal 
Hobson 
is 
unable 
to 
perceive. 


The 
German 
opportunist, 
Gerhard 
Hildebrand, 
who 
was 
expelled 
from 
the 
Party 
for 
defending 
imperialism, 
and 
would 
today 
make 
an 
excellent 
leader 
of 
the 
so-called 
“Social-Democratic” 
Party 
of 
Germany, 
serves 
as 
a 
good 
supplement 
to 
Hobson 
by 
his 
advocacy 
of 
a 
“United 
States 
of 
Western 
Europe” 
(without 
Russia) 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
“joint” 
action 
against 
... 
the 
African 
Negroes, 
against 
the 
“great 
Islamic 
movement,” 
for 
the 
“upkeep 
of 
a 
powerful 
army 
and 
navy,” 
against 
a 
“Sino-Japanese 
coalition,” 
etc. 


The 
description 
of 
“British 
imperialism” 
in 
Schulze-Gävernitz’s 
book 
reveals 
the 
same 
parasitical 
traits. 
The 
national 
income 
of 
Great 
Britain 
approximately 
doubled 
from 
1865 
to 
1898, 
while 
the 
income 
from 
“overseas” 
increased 
ninefold 
in 
the 
same 
period. 
While 
the 
“merit” 
of 
imperialism 
is 
that 
it 
“trains 
the 
Negro 
to 
habits 
of 
industry” 
(not 
without 
coercion 
of 
course 
...), 
the 
“danger” 
of 
imperialism 
is 
that 
Europe 


“will 
shift 
the 
burden 
of 
physical 
toil—first 
agricultural 
and 
mining, 
then 
the 
more 
arduous 
toil 
in 
industry—on 
to 
the 
colored 
races, 
and 
itself 
be 
content 
with 
the 
role 
of 
rentier, 
and 
in 
this 
way, 
perhaps, 
pave 
the 
way 
for 
the 
economic, 
and 
later 
the 
political 
emancipation 
of 
the 
colored 
races.” 


An 
increasing 
proportion 
of 
land 
in 
Great 
Britain 
is 
being 
taken 
out 
of 
cultivation 
and 
used 
for 
sport, 
for 
the 
diversion 
of 
the 
rich. 



“Scotland,” 
says 
Schulze-Gävernitz, 
“is 
the 
most 
artistocratic 
playground 
in 
the 
world—it 
lives 
on 
its 
past 
and 
on 
Mr. 
Carnegie.” 


Great 
Britain 
annually 
spends 
£14,000,000 
on 
horse 
racing 
and 
fox 
hunting. 
The 
number 
of 
bondholders 
in 
Great 
Britain 
has 
risen 
to 
about 
one 
million. 
The 
percentage 
of 
producers 
among 
the 
total 
population 
is 
becoming 
smaller. 


And, 
in 
speaking 
of 
the 
British 
working 
class, 
the 
bourgeois 
student 
of 
“British 
imperialism 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century” 
is 
obliged 
to 
distinguish 
systematically 
between 
the 
“upper 
stratum” 
of 
the 
workers 
and 
the 
“lower 
stratum 
of 
the 
proletariat 
proper.” 
The 
upper 
stratum 
furnishes 
the 
main 
body 
of 
co-operators, 
of 
trade 
unionists, 
of 
members 
of 
sporting 
clubs 
and 
of 
numerous 
religious 
sects. 
The 
electoral 
system, 
which 
in 
Great 
Britain 
is 
“still 
sufficiently 
restricted 
to 
exclude 
the 
lower 
stratum 
of 
the 
proletariat 
proper,” 
is 
adapted 
to 
their 
level! 
In 
order 
to 
present 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
British 
working 
class 
in 
the 
best 
possible 
light, 
only 
this 
upper 
stratum 
—which 
constitutes 
only 
a 
minority 
of 
the 
proletariat—is 
generally 
spoken 
of. 
For 
instance, 
the 
problem 
of 
unemployment 
“is 
mainly 
a 
London 
problem 
and 
that 
of 
the 
lower 
proletarian 
stratum, 
which 
is 
of 
little 
political 
moment.” 


It 
would 
be 
better 
to 
say: 
which 
is 
of 
little 
political 
moment 
for 
the 
bourgeois 
politicians 
and 
the 
“socialist” 
opportunists. 


Another 
special 
feature 
of 
imperialism, 
which 
is 
connected 
with 
the 
facts 
we 
are 
describing, 
is 
the 
decline 
in 
emigration 
from 
imperialist 
countries, 
and 
the 
increase 
in 
immigration 
to 
those 
countries 
from 
the 
backward 
countries 
where 
low 
wages 
are 
paid. 
As 
Hobson 
observes, 
emigration 
from 
Great 
Britain 
has 
been 
declining 
since 
1894. 
In 
that 
year 
the 
number 
of 
emigrants 
from 
Great 
Britain 
was 
242,000, 
while 
in 
1900, 
the 
number 
was 
only 
169,000. 
German 
emigration 
reached 
the 
highest 
point 
between 
1880 
and 
1890, 
with 
a 
total 
of 
1,453,-000 
emigrants. 
In 
the 
course 
of 
the 
following 
two 
decades, 
it 
fell 
to 
544,000 
and 
even 
to 
341,000. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
there 
was 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
number 
of 
workers 
entering 
Germany 
from 
Austria, 
Italy, 
Russia 
and 
other 
countries. 
According 
to 
the 
1907 
census, 
there 
were 
1,342,294 
foreigners 
in 
Germany, 
of 
whom 
440,800 
were 
industrial 
workers 
and 
257,329 
were 
agricultural 
workers. 
In 
France, 
the 
workers 
employed 
in 
the 
mining 
industry 
are, 
“in 
great 
part,” 
foreigners: 
Polish, 
Italian 
and 
Spanish. 
In 
the 
United 
States, 
immigrants 
from 
Eastern 
and 
Southern 
Europe 
are 
engaged 
in 
the 
most 
poorly 
paid 
occupations, 
while 
American 
workers 
provide 
the 
highest 
percentage 
of 
overseers 
or 
of 
the 
better 
paid 
workers. 



Imperialism 
has 
the 
tendency 
of 
creating 
privileged 
sections 
even 
among 
the 
workers, 
and 
of 
detaching 
them 
from 
the 
main 
proletarian 
masses. 


It 
must 
be 
observed 
that 
in 
Great 
Britain 
the 
tendency 
of 
imperialism 
to 
divide 
the 
workers 
in 
this 
way, 
to 
encourage 
opportunism 
among 
them, 
and 
cause 
temporary 
decay 
in 
the 
working 
class 
movement, 
revealed 
itself 
much 
earlier 
than 
the 
end 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
and 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
twentieth 
centuries; 
for 
two 
important 
features 
of 
imperialism 
were 
observed 
in 
Great 
Britain 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
viz., 
vast 
colonial 
possessions 
and 
a 
monopolist 
position 
in 
world 
markets. 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
systematically 
traced 
this 
relation 
between 
opportunism 
in 
the 
labor 
movement 
and 
the 
imperialistic 
features 
of 
British 
capitalism 
for 
several 
decades. 
For 
example, 
on 
October 
7, 
1858, 
Engels 
wrote 
to 
Marx: 


“The 
English 
proletariat 
is 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
bourgeois, 
so 
that 
this 
most 
bourgeois 
of 
all 
nations 
is 
apparently 
aiming 
ultimately 
at 
the 
possession 
of 
a 
bourgeois 
aristocracy 
and 
a 
bourgeois 
proletariat 
as 
well 
as 
a 
bourgeoisie. 
For 
a 
nation 
which 
exploits 
the 
whole 
world 
this 
is, 
of 
course, 
to 
a 
certain 
extent 
justifiable.” 


Almost 
a 
quarter 
of 
a 
century 
later, 
in 
a 
letter 
dated 
August 
11, 
1881, 
Engels 
speaks 
of 
“... 
the 
worst 
type 
of 
British 
trade 
unions 
which 
allow 
themselves 
to 
be 
led 
by 
men 
who 
have 
been 
bought 
by 
the 
capitalists, 
or 
at 
least 
are 
in 
their 
pay.” 
In 
a 
letter 
to 
Kautsky, 
dated 
September 
12, 
1882, 
Engels 
wrote: 


“You 
ask 
me 
what 
the 
English 
workers 
think 
about 
colonial 
policy. 
Well, 
exactly 
the 
same 
as 
they 
think 
about 
politics 
in 
general: 
the 
same 
as 
what 
the 
bourgeois 
think. 
There 
is 
no 
workers’ 
party 
here, 
there 
are 
only 
Conservatives 
and 
Liberal-Radicals, 
and 
the 
workers 
gaily 
share 
the 
feast 
of 
England’s 
monopoly 
of 
the 
world 
market 
and 
the 
colonies.” 
(Engels 
expressed 
similar 
ideas 
in 
the 
press 
in 
his 
preface 
to 
the 
second 
edition 
of 
The 
Condition 
of 
the 
Working 
Class 
in 
England, 
which 
appeared 
in 
1892.) 


We 
thus 
see 
clearly 
the 
causes 
and 
effects. 
The 
causes 
are: 
1) 
Exploitation 
of 
the 
whole 
world 
by 
this 
country. 
2) 
Its 
monopolistic 
position 
in 
the 
world 
market. 
3) 
Its 
colonial 
monopoly. 
The 
effects 
are: 
1) 
A 
section 
of 
the 
British 
proletariat 
becomes 
bourgeois. 
2) 
A 
section 
of 
the 
proletariat 
permits 
itself 
to 
be 
led 
by 
people 
who 
are 
bought 
by 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
or, 
at 
least, 
who 
are 
in 
their 
pay. 


The 
imperialism 
of 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century 
completed 
the 
partition 
of 
the 
world 
among 
a 
very 
few 
states, 
each 
of 
which 
today 
exploits 



(i.e., 
draws 
super-profits 
from) 
a 
part 
of 
the 
world 
only 
a 
little 
smaller 
than 
that 
which 
England 
exploited 
in 
1858. 
Each 
of 
them, 
by 
means 
of 
trusts, 
cartels, 
finance 
capital, 
and 
debtor 
and 
creditor 
relations, 
occupies 
a 
monopoly 
position 
on 
the 
world 
market. 
Each 
of 
them 
enjoys 
to 
some 
degree 
a 
colonial 
monopoly. 
(We 
have 
seen 
that 
out 
of 
the 
total 
of 
75,000,000 
sq. 
km. 
which 
comprise 
the 
whole 
colonial 
world, 
65,000,000 
sq. 
km., 
or 
86 
per 
cent, 
belong 
to 
six 
great 
powers; 
61,000,000 
sq. 
km., 
or 
81 
per 
cent, 
belong 
to 
three 
powers.) 


The 
distinctive 
feature 
of 
the 
present 
situation 
is 
the 
prevalence 
of 
economic 
and 
political 
conditions 
which 
could 
not 
but 
increase 
the 
irreconcilability 
between 
opportunism 
and 
the 
general 
and 
vital 
interests 
of 
the 
working 
class 
movement. 
Embryonic 
imperialism 
has 
grown 
into 
a 
dominant 
system; 
capitalist 
monopolies 
occupy 
first 
place 
in 
economics 
and 
politics; 
the 
division 
of 
the 
world 
has 
been 
completed. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
instead 
of 
an 
undisputed 
monopoly 
by 
Great 
Britain, 
we 
see 
a 
few 
imperialist 
powers 
disputing 
among 
themselves 
for 
the 
right 
to 
share 
in 
this 
monopoly, 
and 
this 
struggle 
is 
characteristic 
of 
the 
whole 
period 
of 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century. 
Opportunism, 
therefore, 
cannot 
now 
triumph 
in 
the 
working 
class 
movement 
of 
any 
country 
for 
decades 
as 
it 
did 
in 
England 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century. 
But 
in 
a 
number 
of 
countries 
it 
has 
grown 
ripe, 
over-ripe, 
and 
rotten, 
and 
has 
become 
completely 
merged 
with 
bourgeois 
policy 
in 
the 
form 
of 
“social-chauvinism.”103 



Chapter 
Ix 


The 
Critique 
Of 
Imperialism 


By 
the 
critique 
of 
imperialism, 
in 
the 
broad 
sense 
of 
the 
term, 
we 
mean 
the 
attitude 
towards 
imperialist 
policy 
of 
the 
different 
classes 
of 
society 
as 
part 
of 
their 
general 
ideology. 


The 
enormous 
dimensions 
of 
finance 
capital 
concentrated 
in 
a 
few 
hands 
and 
creating 
an 
extremely 
extensive 
and 
close 
network 
of 
ties 
and 
relationships 
which 
subordinate 
not 
only 
the 
small 
and 
medium, 
but 
also 
even 
the 
very 
small 
capitalists 
and 
small 
masters, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
the 
intense 
struggle 
waged 
against 
other 
national 
state 
groups 
of 
financiers 
for 
the 
partition 
of 
the 
world 
and 
the 
power 
to 
rule 
over 
other 
countries, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
cause 
the 
wholesale 
transition 
of 
the 
possessing 
classes 
to 
the 
side 
of 
imperialism. 
The 
signs 
of 
the 
times 
are 
a 
“general” 
enthusiasm 
regarding 
its 
prospects, 
a 
passionate 
defense 
of 
imperialism, 
and 
every 
possible 
embellishment 
of 
its 
real 
nature. 
The 
imperialist 
ideology 
also 
permeates 
the 
working 
class. 
There 
is 
no 
Chinese 
Wall 
between 
it 
and 
the 
other 
classes. 
The 
leaders 
of 
the 
so-called 
“Social-Democratic” 
Party 
of 
Germany 
are 
today 
justly 
called 
social-imperialists, 
that 
is, 
socialists 
in 
words 
and 
imperialists 
in 
deeds; 
but 
as 
early 
as 
1902, 
Hobson 
noted 
the 
existence 
of 
“Fabian 
imperialists” 
who 
belonged 
to 
the 
opportunist 
Fabian 
Society 
in 
England. 


The 
bourgeois 
scholars 
and 
publicists 
usually 
come 
out 
in 
defense 
of 
imperialism 
in 
a 
somewhat 
veiled 
form 
and 
obscure 
its 
complete 
domination 
and 
its 
profound 
roots; 
they 
strive 
to 
concentrate 
attention 
on 
details 
and 
secondary 
characteristics 
and 
do 
their 
very 
best 
to 
distract 
attention 
from 
the 
main 
issue 
by 
means 
of 
ridiculous 
schemes 
for 
“reform,” 
such 
as 
police 
supervision 
of 
the 
trusts 
and 
banks, 
etc. 
Less 
frequently, 
cynical 
and 
frank 
imperialists 
speak 
out 
and 
are 
bold 
enough 
to 
admit 
the 
absurdity 
of 
the 
idea 
of 
“reforming” 
the 
fundamental 
features 
of 
imperialism. 


We 
will 
give 
an 
example. 
The 
German 
imperialists 
attempt, 
in 
the 
magazine, 
Archives 
of 
World 
Economy, 
to 
follow 
the 
movements 
for 
national 
emancipation 
in 
the 
colonies, 
particularly, 
of 
course, 
in 
colonies 
other 
than 
those 
belonging 
to 
Germany. 
They 
note 
the 
ferment 
and 
protest 
movements 
in 
India, 
the 
movement 
in 
Natal 
(South 
Africa), 
the 
movements 
in 
the 
Dutch 
East 
Indies, 
etc. 
One 
of 
them, 
commenting 
on 
an 
English 
report 
of 
the 



speeches 
delivered 
at 
a 
conference 
of 
subject 
peoples 
and 
races, 
held 
June 
2830, 
1910, 
at 
which 
representatives 
of 
various 
peoples 
subject 
to 
foreign 
domination 
in 
Africa, 
Asia 
and 
Europe 
were 
present, 
writes 
as 
follows 
in 
appraising 
the 
speeches 
delivered 
at 
this 
conference: 


“We 
are 
told 
that 
we 
must 
fight 
against 
imperialism; 
that 
the 
dominant 
states 
must 
recognize 
the 
right 
of 
subject 
peoples 
to 
home 
rule; 
that 
an 
international 
tribunal 
should 
supervise 
the 
fulfilment 
of 
treaties 
concluded 
between 
the 
great 
powers 
and 
weak 
peoples. 
One 
does 
not 
get 
any 
further 
than 
the 
expression 
of 
these 
pious 
wishes. 
We 
see 
no 
trace 
of 
understanding 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
imperialism 
is 
indissolubly 
bound 
up 
with 
capitalism 
in 
its 
present 
form” 
(!!) 
“and 
therefore 
also 
no 
trace 
of 
the 
realization 
that 
an 
open 
struggle 
against 
imperialism 
would 
be 
hopeless, 
unless, 
perhaps, 
the 
fight 
is 
confined 
to 
protests 
against 
certain 
of 
its 
especially 
abhorrent 
excesses.” 


Since 
the 
reform 
of 
the 
basis 
of 
imperialism 
is 
a 
deception, 
a 
pious 
“wish,” 
since 
the 
bourgeois 
representatives 
of 
oppressed 
nations 
go 
no 
“further” 
forward, 
the 
bourgeois 
representatives 
of 
the 
oppressing 
nation 
go 
“further” 
backward, 
to 
servility 
towards 
imperialism, 
concealed 
by 
the 
cloak 
of 
“science.” 
“Logic,” 
indeed! 


The 
question 
as 
to 
whether 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
reform 
the 
basis 
of 
imperialism, 
whether 
to 
go 
forward 
to 
the 
aggravation 
of 
the 
antagonisms 
which 
it 
engenders, 
or 
backwards, 
towards 
allaying 
these 
antagonisms, 
is 
a 
fundamental 
question 
in 
the 
critique 
of 
imperialism. 
As 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
political 
features 
of 
imperialism 
are 
reaction 
all 
along 
the 
line, 
and 
increased 
national 
oppression, 
resulting 
from 
the 
oppression 
of 
the 
financial 
oligarchy 
and 
the 
elimination 
of 
free 
competition, 
a 
democratic 
petty-bourgeois 
opposition 
has 
been 
rising 
against 
imperialism 
in 
almost 
all 
imperialist 
countries 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century. 
And 
the 
desertion 
of 
Kautsky 
and 
of 
the 
broad 
international 
Kautskyan 
trend 
from 
Marxism 
is 
displayed 
in 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
Kautsky 
not 
only 
did 
not 
trouble 
to 
oppose, 
not 
only 
was 
not 
able 
to 
oppose 
this 
petty-bourgeois 
reformist 
opposition, 
which 
is 
really 
reactionary 
in 
its 
economic 
basis, 
but 
in 
practice 
actually 
became 
merged 
with 
it. 


In 
the 
United 
States, 
the 
imperialist 
war 
waged 
against 
Spain 
in 
1898 
stirred 
up 
the 
opposition 
of 
the 
“anti-imperialists,” 
the 
last 
of 
the 
Mohicans 
of 
bourgeois 
democracy. 
They 
declared 
this 
war 
to 
be 
“criminal,” 
denounced 
the 
annexation 
of 
foreign 
territories 
as 
being 
a 
violation 
of 
the 
constitution, 
and 
denounced 
the 
“Jingo 
treachery” 
by 
means 
of 
which 
Aguinaldo, 
leader 
of 
the 



native 
Filipinos, 
was 
deceived 
(the 
Americans 
promised 
him 
the 
independence 
of 
his 
country, 
but 
later 
they 
landed 
troops 
and 
annexed 
it). 
They 
quoted 
the 
words 
of 
Lincoln: 


“When 
the 
white 
man 
governs 
himself, 
that 
is 
self-government, 
but 
when 
he 
governs 
himself 
and 
also 
governs 
others, 
it 
is 
no 
longer 
self-government; 
it 
is 
despotism.” 


But 
while 
all 
this 
criticism 
shrank 
from 
recognizing 
the 
indissoluble 
bond 
between 
imperialism 
and 
the 
trusts, 
and, 
therefore, 
between 
imperialism 
and 
the 
very 
foundations 
of 
capitalism; 
while 
it 
shrank 
from 
joining 
up 
with 
the 
forces 
engendered 
by 
large-scale 
capitalism 
and 
its 
development——it 
remained 
a 
“pious 
wish.” 


This 
is 
also, 
in 
the 
main, 
the 
attitude 
of 
Hobson 
in 
his 
criticism 
of 
imperialism. 
Hobson 
anticipated 
Kautsky 
in 
protesting 
against 
the 
“inevitability 
of 
imperialism,” 
and 
in 
calling 
for 
the 
need 
to 
“raise 
the 
consuming 
capacity 
of 
the 
people” 
(under 
capitalism!). 
The 
petty-bourgeois 
point 
of 
view 
in 
the 
critique 
of 
imperialism, 
the 
domination 
of 
the 
banks, 
the 
financial 
oligarchy, 
etc., 
is 
that 
adopted 
by 
the 
authors 
we 
have 
often 
quoted, 
such 
as 
Agahd, 
A. 
Lansburgh, 
L. 
Eschwege; 
and 
among 
French 
writers, 
Victor 
Bérard, 
author 
of 
a 
superficial 
book 
entitled 
England 
and 
Imperialism 
which 
appeared 
in 
1900. 
All 
these 
authors, 
who 
make 
no 
claim 
to 
being 
Marxists, 
contrast 
imperialism 
with 
free 
competition 
and 
democracy; 
they 
condemn 
the 
Bagdad 
railway 
“scheme” 
as 
leading 
to 
disputes 
and 
war, 
utter 
“pious 
wishes” 
for 
peace, 
etc. 
This 
applies 
also 
to 
the 
compiler 
of 
international 
stock 
and 
share 
issue 
statistics, 
A. 
Neymarck, 
who, 
after 
calculating 
the 
hundreds 
of 
billions 
of 
francs 
representing 
“international” 
values, 
exclaimed 
in 
1912: 
“Is 
it 
possible 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
peace 
can 
be 
disturbed... 
that, 
in 
the 
face 
of 
these 
enormous 
figures, 
anyone 
would 
risk 
starting 
a 
war?” 


Such 
simplicity 
of 
mind 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
bourgeois 
economists 
is 
not 
surprising. 
Besides, 
it 
is 
in 
their 
interests 
to 
pretend 
to 
be 
so 
naive 
and 
to 
talk 
“seriously” 
about 
peace 
under 
imperialism. 
But 
what 
remains 
of 
Kautsky’s 
Marxism, 
when, 
in 
1914-15-16, 
he 
takes 
up 
the 
same 
attitude 
as 
the 
bourgeois 
reformists 
and 
affirms 
that 
“everybody 
is 
agreed” 
(imperialists, 
pseudo-socialists 
and 
social-pacifists) 
as 
regards 
peace? 
Instead 
of 
an 
analysis 
of 
imperialism 
and 
an 
exposure 
of 
the 
depths 
of 
its 
contradictions, 
we 
have 
nothing 
but 
a 
reformist 
“pious 
wish” 
to 
waive 
it 
aside, 
to 
evade 
it. 


Here 
is 
an 
example 
of 
Kautsky’s 
economic 
criticism 
of 
imperialism. 
He 



takes 
the 
statistics 
of 
British 
import 
and 
export 
trade 
with 
Egypt 
for 
1872 
and 
1912. 
These 
statistics 
show 
that 
this 
import 
and 
export 
trade 
has 
developed 
more 
slowly 
than 
British 
foreign 
trade 
as 
a 
whole. 
From 
this 
Kautsky 
concludes: 


“We 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
suppose 
that 
British 
trade 
with 
Egypt 
would 
have 
been 
less 
developed 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
mere 
operation 
of 
economic 
factors, 
without 
military 
occupation.... 
The 
urge 
of 
the 
present-day 
states 
to 
expand 
can 
be 
best 
satisfied, 
not 
by 
the 
violent 
methods 
of 
imperialism, 
but 
by 
peaceful 
democracy.” 


This 
argument, 
which 
is 
repeated 
in 
every 
key 
by 
Kautsky’s 
armor-bearer 
(and 
the 
Russian 
protector 
of 
social-chauvinists), 
Mr. 
Spectator, 
forms 
the 
basis 
of 
Kautskyan 
criticism 
of 
imperialism 
and 
that 
is 
why 
we 
must 
deal 
with 
it 
in 
greater 
detail. 
We 
will 
begin 
with 
a 
quotation 
from 
Hilferding, 
whose 
conclusions, 
as 
Kautsky 
on 
many 
occasions, 
and 
notably 
in 
April 
1915, 
declared, 
have 
been 
“unanimously 
adopted 
by 
all 
socialist 
theoreticians.” 


“It 
is 
not 
the 
business 
of 
the 
proletariat,” 
wrote 
Hilferding, 
“to 
contrast 
the 
more 
progressive 
capitalist 
policy 
to 
that 
of 
the 
now 
bygone 
era, 
of 
free 
trade 
and 
of 
hostility 
towards 
the 
state. 
The 
reply 
of 
the 
proletariat 
to 
the 
economic 
policy 
of 
finance 
capital, 
to 
imperialism, 
cannot 
be 
free 
trade, 
but 
socialism. 
The 
aim 
of 
proletarian 
policy 
cannot 
now 
be 
the 
ideal 
of 
restoring 
free 
competition—which 
has 
now 
become 
a 
reactionary 
ideal—but 
the 
complete 
abolition 
of 
competition 
by 
the 
abolition 
of 
capitalism.” 


Kautsky 
departed 
from 
Marxism 
by 
advocating 
what 
is, 
in 
the 
period 
of 
finance 
capital, 
a 
“reactionary 
ideal,” 
“peaceful 
democracy,” 
“the 
mere 
operation 
of 
economic 
factors,” 
etc., 
for 
objectively, 
this 
ideal 
drags 
us 
back 
from 
monopoly 
capitalism 
to 
the 
non-monopolist 
stage, 
and 
is 
a 
reformist 
swindle. 


Trade 
with 
Egypt 
(or 
with 
any 
other 
colony 
or 
semi-colony) 
would 
have 
been 
better 
“developed” 
without 
military 
occupation, 
without 
imperialism, 
and 
without 
finance 
capital.... 
What 
does 
this 
mean? 
That 
capitalism 
would 
develop 
more 
rapidly 
if 
free 
competition 
were 
not 
restricted 
by 
monopolies 
in 
general, 
by 
the 
“connections” 
or 
the 
yoke 
(i.e., 
the 
monopoly) 
of 
finance 
capital, 
or 
by 
the 
monopolist 
possession 
of 
colonies 
by 
certain 
countries? 


Kautsky’s 
argument 
can 
have 
no 
other 
meaning; 
and 
this 
“meaning” 
is 
meaningless. 
But 
suppose, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
argument, 
free 
competition, 
without 
any 
sort 
of 
monopoly, 
would 
develop 
capitalism 
and 
trade 
more 



rapidly. 
Is 
it 
not 
a 
fact 
that 
the 
more 
rapidly 
trade 
and 
capitalism 
develop, 
the 
greater 
is 
the 
concentration 
of 
production 
and 
capital 
which 
gives 
rise 
to 
monopoly? 
And 
monopolies 
have 
already 
come 
into 
being 
—precisely 
out 
of 
free 
competition. 
Even 
if 
monopolies 
have 
now 
begun 
to 
retard 
progress, 
it 
is 
not 
an 
argument 
in 
favor 
of 
free 
competition, 
which 
has 
become 
impossible 
since 
it 
gave 
rise 
to 
monopoly. 


Whichever 
way 
one 
turns 
Kautsky’s 
argument, 
one 
will 
find 
nothing 
in 
it 
except 
reaction 
and 
bourgeois 
reformism. 


Even 
if 
we 
modify 
this 
argument 
and 
say, 
as 
Spectator 
says, 
that 
the 
trade 
of 
the 
British 
colonies 
with 
the 
mother 
country 
is 
now 
developing 
more 
slowly 
than 
their 
trade 
with 
other 
countries, 
it 
does 
not 
save 
Kautsky; 
for 
it 
is 
also 
monopoly 
and 
imperialism 
that 
is 
beating 
Great 
Britain, 
only 
it 
is 
the 
monopoly 
and 
imperialism 
of 
another 
country 
(America, 
Germany). 
It 
is 
known 
that 
the 
cartels 
have 
given 
rise 
to 
a 
new 
and 
peculiar 
form 
of 
protective 
tariff: 
goods 
suitable 
for 
export 
are 
protected 
(Engels 
noted 
this 
in 
Vol. 
III 
of 
Capital). 
It 
is 
known, 
too, 
that 
the 
cartels 
and 
finance 
capital 
have 
a 
system 
peculiar 
to 
themselves, 
that 
of 
exporting 
goods 
at 
“dumping 
prices,” 
or 
“dumping,” 
as 
the 
English 
call 
it: 
within 
a 
given 
country 
the 
cartel 
sells 
its 
goods 
at 
a 
high 
price 
fixed 
by 
monopoly; 
abroad 
it 
sells 
them 
at 
a 
much 
lower 
price 
to 
undercut 
the 
competitor, 
to 
enlarge 
its 
own 
production 
to 
the 
utmost, 
etc. 
If 
German 
trade 
with 
the 
British 
colonies 
is 
developing 
more 
rapidly 
than 
that 
of 
Great 
Britain 
with 
the 
same 
colonies, 
it 
only 
proves 
that 
German 
imperialism 
is 
younger, 
stronger 
and 
better 
organized 
than 
British 
imperialism, 
is 
superior 
to 
it. 
But 
this 
by 
no 
means 
proves 
the 
“superiority” 
of 
free 
trade, 
for 
it 
is 
not 
free 
trade 
fighting 
against 
protection 
and 
colonial 
dependence, 
but 
two 
rival 
imperialisms, 
two 
monopolies, 
two 
groups 
of 
finance 
capital. 
The 
superiority 
of 
German 
imperialism 
over 
British 
imperialism 
is 
stronger 
than 
the 
wall 
of 
colonial 
frontiers 
or 
of 
protective 
tariffs. 
To 
use 
this 
as 
an 
argument 
in 
favor 
of 
free 
trade 
and 
“peaceful 
democracy” 
is 
banality, 
is 
to 
forget 
the 
essential 
features 
and 
qualities 
of 
imperialism, 
to 
substitute 
petty-bourgeois 
reformism 
for 
Marxism. 


It 
is 
interesting 
to 
note 
that 
even 
the 
bourgeois 
economist, 
A. 
Lansburgh, 
whose 
criticism 
of 
imperialism 
is 
as 
petty-bourgeois 
as 
Kautsky’s, 
nevertheless 
got 
closer 
to 
a 
more 
scientific 
study 
of 
commercial 
statistics. 
He 
did 
not 
compare 
merely 
one 
country 
chosen 
at 
random, 
and 
a 
colony, 
with 
the 
other 
countries; 
he 
examined 
the 
export 
trade 
of 
an 
imperialist 
country: 
1) 
with 
countries 
which 
are 
financially 
dependent 
upon 
it, 
which 
borrow 
money 



from 
it, 
and 
2) 
with 
countries 
which 
are 
financially 
independent. 
He 
obtained 
the 
following 
results: 


EXPORT 
TRADE 
OF 
GERMANY 
(millions 
of 
marks) 


Lansburgh 
did 
not 
add 
up 
the 
columns 
and 
therefore, 
strangely 
enough, 
failed 
to 
observe 
that 
if 
the 
figures 
prove 
anything 
at 
all, 
they 
prove 
that 
he 
is 
wrong, 
for 
the 
exports 
to 
countries 
financially 
dependent 
on 
Germany 
have 
grown 
more 
rapidly, 
if 
only 
slightly, 
than 
those 
to 
the 
countries 
which 
are 
financially 
independent. 
(We 
emphasize 
the 
“if,” 
for 
Lansburgh’s 
figures 
are 
far 
from 
complete.) 


On 
the 
relation 
between 
export 
trade 
and 
loans, 
Lansburgh 
wrote: 


“In 
1890-91, 
a 
Rumanian 
loan 
was 
floated 
through 
the 
German 
banks 
which 
had 
already 
in 
previous 
years 
made 
advances 
on 
this 
loan. 
The 
loan 
was 
used 
chiefly 
for 
purchases 
by 
Rumania 
of 
railway 
material 
in 
Germany. 
In 
1891 
German 
exports 
to 
Rumania 
amounted 
to 
55,000,000 
marks. 
The 
following 
year 
they 
fell 
to 
39,400,000 
marks; 
then 
with 
fluctuations, 
to 
25,400,000 
in 
1900. 
Only 
in 
very 
recent 
years 
have 
they 
regained 
the 
level 
of 
1891, 
thanks 
to 
a 
few 
new 
loans. 


“German 
exports 
to 
Portugal 
rose, 
following 
the 
loans 
of 
1888-89 
to 
21,000,000 
(1890); 
then 
fell, 
in 
the 
two 
following 
years, 
to 
16,200,000 
and 
7,400,000; 
and 
only 
regained 
their 
former 
level 
in 
1903. 


“German 
trade 
with 
the 
Argentine 
is 
still 
more 
striking. 
Following 
the 
loans 
floated 
in 
1888 
and 
1890, 
German 
exports 
to 
the 
Argentine 
reached, 
in 
1889, 
60,700,000 
marks. 
Two 
years 
later 
they 
only 
reached 
18,600,000 
marks, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
less 
than 
one-third 
of 
the 
previous 
figures. 
It 
was 
not 
until 
1901 
that 
they 
regained 
and 
surpassed 
the 
level 
of 
1889, 
and 
then 
only 
as 
a 
result 
of 
new 
loans 
floated 
by 
the 
state 
and 
by 
municipalities, 
with 
advances 
to 
build 
power 
stations, 
and 
with 
other 
credit 
operations. 


“As 
for 
Chile, 
exports 
to 
that 
country 
rose 
to 
45,200,000 
marks 
in 
1892, 
after 
the 
loan 
negotiated 
in 
1889. 
The 
following 
year 
they 
fell 
to 
22,500,000 
marks. 
A 
new 
Chilean 
loan 
floated 
by 
the 
German 
banks 
in 
1906 
was 
followed 
by 
a 
rise 
of 
exports, 
in 
1907, 
to 
84,700,000 
marks, 
only 
to 
fall 
again 
to 
52,400,000 
marks 
in 
1908.” 


From 
all 
these 
facts 
Lansburgh 
draws 
the 
amusing 
petty-bourgeois 
moral 
of 
how 
unstable 
and 
irregular 
export 
trade 
is 
when 
it 
is 
bound 
up 
with 
loans, 
how 
bad 
it 
is 
to 
invest 
capital 
abroad 
instead 
of 
“naturally” 
and 
“harmoniously” 
developing 
home 
industry, 
how 
“costly” 
is 
the 
baksheesh 
that 
Krupp 
has 
to 
pay 
in 
floating 
foreign 
loans, 
etc.! 
But 
the 
facts 
are 
clear. 



The 
increase 
in 
exports 
is 
closely 
connected 
with 
the 
swindling 
tricks 
of 
finance 
capital, 
which 
is 
not 
concerned 
with 
bourgeois 
morality, 
but 
with 
skinning 
the 
ox 
twice—first, 
it 
pockets 
the 
profits 
from 
the 
loan; 
then 
it 
pockets 
other 
profits 
from 
the 
same 
loan 
which 
the 
borrower 
uses 
to 
make 
purchases 
from 
Krupp, 
or 
to 
purchase 
railway 
material 
from 
the 
Steel 
Syndicate, 
etc. 


We 
repeat 
that 
we 
do 
not 
by 
any 
means 
consider 
Lansburgh’s 
figures 
to 
be 
perfect. 
But 
we 
had 
to 
quote 
them 
because 
they 
are 
more 
scientific 
than 
Kautsky’s 
and 
Spectator’s 
and 
because 
Lansburgh 
showed 
the 
correct 
way 
of 
approaching 
the 
question. 
In 
discussing 
the 
significance 
of 
finance 
capital 
in 
regard 
to 
exports, 
etc., 
one 
must 
be 
able 
to 
single 
out 
the 
connection 
of 
exports 
especially 
and 
solely 
with 
the 
tricks 
of 
the 
financiers, 
especially 
and 
solely 
with 
the 
sale 
of 
goods 
by 
cartels, 
etc. 
Simply 
to 
compare 
colonies 
with 
non-colonies, 
one 
imperialism 
with 
another 
imperialism, 
one 
semi-colony 
or 
colony 
(Egypt) 
with 
all 
other 
countries, 
is 
to 
evade 
and 
to 
tone 
down 
the 
very 
gist 
of 
the 
question. 


Kautsky’s 
theoretical 
critique 
of 
imperialism 
has 
nothing 
in 
common 
with 
Marxism 
and 
serves 
no 
other 
purpose 
than 
as 
a 
preamble 
to 
propaganda 
for 
peace 
and 
unity 
with 
the 
opportunists 
and 
the 
social-chauvinists, 
precisely 
for 
the 
reason 
that 
it 
evades 
and 
obscures 
the 
very 
profound 
and 
radical 
contradictions 
of 
imperialism: 
the 
contradictions 
between 
monopoly 
and 
free 
competition 
that 
exists 
side 
by 
side 
with 
it, 
between 
the 
gigantic 
“operations” 
(and 
gigantic 
profits) 
of 
finance 
capital 
and 
“honest” 
trade 
on 
the 
free 
market, 
the 
contradictions 
between 
combines 
and 
trusts, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
nontrustified 
industry, 
on 
the 
other, 
etc. 


The 
notorious 
theory 
of 
“ultra-imperialism,” 
invented 
by 
Kautsky, 
is 
equally 
reactionary. 
Compare 
his 
arguments 
on 
this 
subject 
in 
1915, 
with 
Hobson’s 
arguments 
in 
1902. 


Kautsky: 


“... 
whether 
the 
present 
imperialist 
policy 
cannot 
be 
supplanted 
by 
a 
new, 
ultra-imperialist 
policy, 
which 
will 
introduce 
the 
joint 
exploitation 
of 
the 
world 
by 
internationally 
united 
finance 
capital 
in 
place 
of 
the 
mutual 
rivalries 
of 
national 
finance 
capital. 
Such 
a 
new 
phase 
of 
capitalism 
is, 
at 
any 
rate, 
conceivable. 
Can 
it 
be 
achieved? 
Sufficient 
premises 
are 
still 
lacking 
to 
enable 
us 
to 
answer 
this 
question.” 


Hobson: 


“Christendom 
thus 
laid 
out 
in 
a 
few 
great 
federal 
empires, 
each 
with 
a 



retinue 
of 
uncivilized 
dependencies, 
seems 
to 
many 
the 
most 
legitimate 
development 
of 
present 
tendencies 
and 
one 
which 
would 
offer 
the 
best 
hope 
of 
permanent 
peace 
on 
an 
assured 
basis 
of 
inter-imperialism.” 


Kautsky 
called 
ultra-imperialism 
or 
super-imperialism 
what 
Hobson 
thirteen 
years 
earlier 
had 
described 
as 
inter-imperialism. 
Except 
for 
coining 
a 
new 
and 
clever 
word, 
by 
replacing 
one 
Latin 
prefix 
by 
another, 
the 
only 
progress 
Kautsky 
has 
made 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
“scientific” 
thought 
is 
that 
he 
has 
labelled 
as 
Marxism 
that 
which 
Hobson, 
in 
effect, 
described 
as 
the 
cant 
of 
English 
parsons. 
After 
the 
Anglo-Boer 
War 
it 
was 
quite 
natural 
that 
this 
worthy 
caste 
should 
exert 
every 
effort 
to 
console 
the 
British 
middle 
class 
and 
the 
workers 
who 
had 
lost 
many 
of 
their 
relatives 
on 
the 
battle-fields 
of 
South 
Africa 
and 
who 
were 
obliged 
to 
pay 
high 
taxes 
in 
order 
to 
guarantee 
still 
higher 
profits 
for 
the 
British 
financiers. 
And 
what 
better 
consolation 
could 
there 
be 
than 
the 
theory 
that 
imperialism 
is 
not 
so 
bad; 
that 
it 
stands 
close 
to 
inter-(or 
ultra-) 
imperialism 
while 
it 
promises 
permanent 
peace? 
No 
matter 
what 
the 
good 
intentions 
of 
the 
British 
parsons, 
or 
of 
sentimental 
Kautsky, 
may 
have 
been, 
the 
only 
objective, 
i.e., 
real, 
social 
meaning 
Kautsky’s 
“theory” 
can 
have 
is 
that 
it 
is 
a 
most 
reactionary 
method 
of 
consoling 
the 
masses 
with 
hopes 
of 
permanent 
peace 
being 
possible 
under 
capitalism, 
detracting 
their 
attention 
from 
the 
sharp 
antagonisms 
and 
acute 
problems 
of 
the 
present 
era, 
and 
directing 
it 
along 
illusory 
perspectives 
of 
an 
imaginary 
“ultra-imperialism” 
of 
the 
future. 
Deception 
of 
the 
masses—there 
is 
nothing 
but 
this 
in 
Kautsky’s 
“Marxian” 
theory. 


Indeed, 
it 
is 
enough 
to 
compare 
well-known 
and 
indisputable 
facts 
to 
become 
convinced 
of 
the 
utter 
falsity 
of 
the 
prospects 
which 
Kautsky 
tries 
to 
conjure 
up 
before 
the 
German 
workers 
(and 
the 
workers 
of 
all 
lands). 
Let 
us 
consider 
India, 
Indo-China 
and 
China. 
It 
is 
known 
that 
these 
three 
colonial 
and 
semi-colonial 
countries, 
inhabited 
by 
six 
to 
seven 
hundred 
million 
human 
beings, 
are 
subjected 
to 
the 
exploitation 
of 
the 
finance 
capital 
of 
several 
imperialist 
states: 
Great 
Britain, 
France, 
Japan, 
the 
U.S.A., 
etc. 
We 
will 
presume 
that 
these 
imperialist 
countries 
form 
alliances 
against 
one 
another 
in 
order 
to 
protect 
and 
extend 
their 
possessions, 
their 
interests 
and 
their 
spheres 
of 
influence 
in 
these 
Asiatic 
states; 
these 
alliances 
will 
be 
“inter-imperialist,” 
or 
“ultra-imperialist” 
alliances. 
We 
will 
presume 
that 
all 
the 
imperialist 
countries 
conclude 
an 
alliance 
for 
the 
“peaceful” 
sharing 
out 
of 
these 
parts 
of 
Asia; 
this 
alliance 
would 
be 
an 
alliance 
of 
“internationally 
united 
finance 
capital.” 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
alliances 
of 
this 
kind 
have 
been 
made 
in 
the 



twentieth 
century, 
notably 
with 
regard 
to 
China. 
We 
ask, 
is 
it 
“conceivable,” 
assuming 
that 
the 
capitalist 
system 
remains 
intact—and 
this 
is 
precisely 
the 
assumption 
that 
Kautsky 
does 
make—that 
such 
alliances 
would 
be 
more 
than 
temporary, 
that 
they 
would 
eliminate 
friction, 
conflicts 
and 
struggle 
in 
all 
and 
every 
possible 
form? 


This 
question 
only 
requires 
stating 
clearly 
enough 
to 
make 
it 
impossible 
for 
any 
but 
a 
negative 
reply 
to 
be 
given; 
for 
there 
can 
be 
no 
other 
conceivable 
basis 
under 
capitalism 
for 
the 
sharing 
out 
of 
spheres 
of 
influence, 
of 
interests, 
of 
colonies, 
etc., 
than 
a 
calculation 
of 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
participants 
in 
the 
share 
out, 
their 
general, 
economic, 
financial, 
military 
strength, 
etc. 
And 
the 
strength 
of 
these 
participants 
in 
the 
share 
out 
does 
not 
change 
to 
an 
equal 
degree, 
for 
under 
capitalism 
the 
development 
of 
different 
undertakings, 
trusts, 
branches 
of 
industry 
or 
countries 
cannot 
be 
even. 
Half 
a 
century 
ago, 
Germany 
was 
a 
miserable 
insignificant 
country, 
as 
far 
as 
its 
capitalist 
strength 
was 
concerned, 
compared 
with 
the 
strength 
of 
England 
at 
that 
time. 
Japan 
was 
similarly 
insignificant 
compared 
with 
Russia. 
Is 
it 
“conceivable” 
that 
in 
ten 
or 
twenty 
years’ 
time 
the 
relative 
strengths 
of 
the 
imperialist 
powers 
will 
have 
remained 
unchanged? 
Absolutely 
inconceivable. 


Therefore, 
“inter-imperialist” 
or 
“ultra-imperialist” 
alliances, 
in 
the 
realities 
of 
the 
capitalist 
system, 
and 
not 
in 
the 
banal 
philistine 
phantasies 
of 
English 
parsons 
or 
of 
the 
German 
“Marxist,” 
Kautsky, 
no 
matter 
what 
form 
they 
may 
assume, 
whether 
of 
one 
imperialist 
coalition 
against 
another, 
or 
of 
a 
general 
alliance 
embracing 
all 
the 
imperialist 
powers, 
are 
inevitably 
nothing 
more 
than 
a 
“truce” 
in 
periods 
between 
wars. 
Peaceful 
alliances 
prepare 
the 
ground 
for 
wars, 
and 
in 
their 
turn 
grow 
out 
of 
wars; 
the 
one 
is 
the 
condition 
for 
the 
other, 
giving 
rise 
to 
alternating 
forms 
of 
peaceful 
and 
non-peaceful 
struggle 
out 
of 
the 
single 
basis 
of 
imperialist 
connections 
and 
the 
relations 
between 
world 
economics 
and 
world 
politics. 
But 
in 
order 
to 
pacify 
the 
workers 
and 
to 
reconcile 
them 
with 
the 
social-chauvinists 
who 
have 
deserted 
to 
the 
side 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
wise 
Kautsky 
separates 
one 
link 
of 
a 
single 
chain 
from 
the 
other, 
separates 
the 
present 
peaceful 
(and 
ultra-imperialist, 
nay, 
ultra-ultra-imperialist) 
alliance 
of 
all 
the 
powers 
for 
the 
“pacification” 
of 
China 
(remember 
the 
suppression 
of 
the 
Boxer 
Rebellion) 
from 
the 
non-
peaceful 
conflict 
of 
tomorrow, 
which 
will 
prepare 
the 
ground 
for 
another 
“peaceful” 
general 
alliance 
for 
the 
partition, 
say, 
of 
Turkey, 
on 
the 
day 
after 
tomorrow, 
etc., 
etc. 
Instead 
of 
showing 
the 
vital 
connection 
between 
periods 
of 
imperialist 
peace 
and 
periods 
of 
imperialist 
war, 
Kautsky 
puts 
before 
the 



workers 
a 
lifeless 
abstraction 
solely 
in 
order 
to 
reconcile 
them 
to 
their 
lifeless 
leaders. 


An 
American 
writer, 
David 
Jayne 
Hill, 
in 
his 
History 
of 
Diplomacy 
in 
the 
International 
Development 
of 
Europe, 
points 
out 
in 
his 
preface 
the 
following 
periods 
of 
contemporary 
diplomatic 
history: 
1) 
The 
revolutionary 
period; 
2) 
The 
constitutional 
movement; 
3) 
The 
present 
period 
of 
“commercial 
imperialism.” 
Another 
writer 
divides 
the 
history 
of 
Great 
Britain’s 
foreign 
policy 
since 
1870 
into 
four 
periods: 
1) 
The 
first 
Asiatic 
period: 
that 
of 
the 
struggle 
against 
Russia’s 
advance 
in 
Central 
Asia 
towards 
India; 
2) 
The 
African 
period 
(approximately 
1885-1902): 
that 
of 
the 
struggle 
against 
France 
for 
the 
partition 
of 
Africa 
(the 
Fashoda 
incident 
of 
1898 
which 
brought 
France 
within 
a 
hair’s 
breadth 
of 
war 
with 
Great 
Britain); 
3) 
The 
second 
Asiatic 
period 
(alliance 
with 
Japan 
against 
Russia), 
and 
4) 
The 
European 
period, 
chiefly 
anti-German. 
“The 
political 
skirmishes 
of 
outposts 
take 
place 
on 
the 
financial 
field,” 
wrote 
Riesser, 
the 
banker, 
in 
1905, 
in 
showing 
how 
French 
finance 
capital 
operating 
in 
Italy 
was 
preparing 
the 
way 
for 
a 
political 
alliance 
between 
the 
countries, 
and 
how 
a 
conflict 
was 
developing 
between 
Great 
Britain 
and 
Germany 
over 
Persia, 
among 
all 
the 
European 
capitalists 
over 
Chinese 
loans, 
etc. 
Behold, 
the 
living 
reality 
of 
peaceful 
“ultra-imperialist” 
alliances 
in 
their 
indissoluble 
connection 
with 
ordinary 
imperialist 
conflicts! 


The 
toning 
down 
of 
the 
deepest 
contradictions 
of 
imperialism 
by 
Kautsky, 
which 
inevitably 
becomes 
an 
embellishment 
of 
imperialism, 
leaves 
its 
traces 
in 
this 
writer’s 
criticism 
of 
the 
political 
features 
of 
imperialism. 
Imperialism 
is 
the 
epoch 
of 
finance 
capital 
and 
of 
monopolies, 
which 
introduce 
everywhere 
the 
striving 
for 
domination, 
not 
for 
freedom. 
The 
result 
is 
reaction 
all 
along 
the 
line, 
whatever 
the 
political 
system, 
and 
an 
extreme 
intensification 
of 
existing 
antagonisms 
in 
this 
domain 
also. 
Particularly 
acute 
becomes 
the 
yoke 
of 
national 
oppression 
and 
the 
striving 
for 
annexations, 
i.e., 
the 
violation 
of 
national 
independence 
(for 
annexation 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
the 
violation 
of 
the 
right 
of 
nations 
to 
self-determination). 
Hilferding 
justly 
draws 
attention 
to 
the 
relation 
between 
imperialism 
and 
the 
growth 
of 
national 
oppression. 


“In 
regard 
to 
the 
newly 
opened 
up 
countries 
themselves,” 
he 
writes, 
“the 
capitalism 
imported 
into 
them 
intensifies 
contradictions 
and 
constantly 
excites 
the 
growing 
resistance 
against 
the 
intruders 
of 
the 
peoples 
who 
are 
awakened 
to 
national 
consciousness. 
This 
resistance 
can 
easily 
become 



transformed 
into 
dangerous 
measures 
directed 
against 
foreign 
capital. 
The 
old 
social 
relations 
become 
completely 
revolutionized. 
The 
age-long 
agrarian 
incrustation 
of 
‘nations 
without 
a 
history’ 
is 
blasted 
away, 
and 
they 
are 
drawn 
into 
the 
capitalist 
whirlpool. 
Capitalism 
itself 
gradually 
procures 
for 
the 
vanquished 
the 
means 
and 
resources 
for 
their 
emancipation 
and 
they 
set 
out 
to 
achieve 
the 
same 
goal 
which 
once 
seemed 
highest 
to 
the 
European 
nations: 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
single 
national 
state 
as 
a 
means 
to 
economic 
and 
cultural 
freedom. 
This 
movement 
for 
national 
independence 
threatens 
European 
capital 
in 
its 
valuable 
and 
most 
promising 
fields 
of 
exploitation 
and 
European 
capital 
can 
maintain 
its 
domination 
to 
an 
increasing 
extent 
only 
by 
continually 
increasing 
its 
means 
of 
exercising 
violence.” 


To 
this 
must 
be 
added 
that 
it 
is 
not 
only 
in 
newly 
opened 
up 
countries, 
but 
also 
in 
the 
old, 
that 
imperialism 
is 
leading 
to 
annexation, 
to 
increased 
national 
oppression, 
and, 
consequently, 
also 
to 
increased 
resistance. 
While 
opposing 
the 
intensification 
of 
political 
reaction 
caused 
by 
imperialism, 
Kautsky 
obscures 
the 
question, 
which 
has 
become 
very 
serious, 
of 
the 
impossibility 
of 
unity 
with 
the 
opportunists 
in 
the 
epoch 
of 
imperialism. 
While 
objecting 
to 
annexations, 
he 
presents 
his 
objections 
in 
a 
form 
that 
will 
be 
most 
acceptable 
and 
least 
offensive 
to 
the 
opportunists. 
He 
addresses 
himself 
to 
a 
German 
audience, 
yet 
he 
obscures 
the 
most 
topical 
and 
important 
point, 
for 
instance, 
the 
annexation 
by 
Germany 
of 
Alsace-Lorraine. 
In 
order 
to 
appraise 
this 
“mental 
aberration” 
we 
will 
take 
the 
following 
example. 
Let 
us 
suppose 
that 
a 
Japanese 
is 
condemning 
the 
annexation 
of 
the 
Philippine 
Islands 
by 
the 
Americans. 
Will 
many 
believe 
that 
he 
is 
doing 
so 
because 
he 
has 
a 
horror 
of 
annexations 
as 
such, 
and 
not 
because 
he 
himself 
has 
a 
desire 
to 
annex 
the 
Philippines? 
And 
shall 
we 
not 
be 
constrained 
to 
admit 
that 
the 
“fight” 
the 
Japanese 
is 
waging 
against 
annexations 
can 
be 
regarded 
as 
sincere 
and 
politically 
honest 
only 
if 
he 
fights 
against 
the 
annexation 
of 
Korea 
by 
Japan, 
and 
urges 
freedom 
for 
Korea 
to 
secede 
from 
Japan? 


Kautsky’s 
theoretical 
analysis 
of 
imperialism, 
as 
well 
as 
his 
economic 
and 
political 
criticism 
of 
imperialism, 
is 
permeated 
through 
and 
through 
with 
a 
spirit, 
absolutely 
incompatible 
with 
Marxism, 
of 
obscuring 
and 
glossing 
over 
the 
most 
profound 
contradictions 
of 
imperialism, 
and 
with 
a 
striving 
to 
preserve 
the 
crumbling 
unity 
with 
opportunism 
in 
the 
European 
labor 
movement 
at 
all 
costs. 



Chapter 
X 


The 
Place 
Of 
Imperialism 
In 
History 


We 
have 
seen 
that 
the 
economic 
quintessence 
of 
imperialism 
is 
monopoly 
capitalism. 
This 
very 
fact 
determines 
its 
place 
in 
history, 
for 
monopoly 
that 
grew 
up 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
free 
competition, 
and 
out 
of 
free 
competition, 
is 
the 
transition 
from 
the 
capitalist 
system 
to 
a 
higher 
social 
economic 
order. 
We 
must 
take 
special 
note 
of 
the 
four 
principal 
forms 
of 
monopoly, 
or 
the 
four 
principal 
manifestations 
of 
monoply 
capitalism, 
which 
are 
characteristic 
of 
the 
period 
under 
review. 


1) 
Monopoly 
arose 
out 
of 
the 
concentration 
of 
production 
at 
a 
very 
advanced 
stage 
of 
development. 
This 
refers 
to 
the 
monopolist 
capitalist 
combines: 
cartels, 
syndicates 
and 
trusts. 
We 
have 
seen 
the 
important 
role 
these 
play 
in 
modern 
economic 
life. 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century, 
monopolies 
acquired 
complete 
supremacy 
in 
the 
advanced 
countries. 
And 
although 
the 
first 
steps 
towards 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
combines 
were 
first 
taken 
by 
countries 
enjoying 
the 
protection 
of 
high 
tariffs 
(Germany, 
America), 
England, 
with 
her 
system 
of 
free 
trade, 
was 
not 
far 
behind 
in 
revealing 
the 
same 
phenomenon, 
namely, 
the 
birth 
of 
monopoly 
out 
of 
the 
concentration 
of 
production. 
2) 
Monopolies 
have 
accelerated 
the 
capture 
of 
the 
most 
important 
sources 
of 
raw 
materials, 
especially 
for 
the 
coal 
and 
iron 
industry, 
which 
is 
the 
basic 
and 
most 
highly 
trustified 
industry 
in 
capitalist 
society. 
The 
monopoly 
of 
the 
most 
important 
sources 
of 
raw 
materials 
has 
enormously 
increased 
the 
power 
of 
big 
capital, 
and 
has 
sharpened 
the 
antagonism 
between 
trustified 
and 
nontrustified 
industry. 
3) 
Monopoly 
has 
sprung 
from 
the 
banks. 
The 
banks 
have 
developed 
from 
modest 
intermediary 
enterprises 
into 
the 
monopolists 
of 
finance 
capital. 
Some 
three 
or 
five 
of 
the 
biggest 
banks 
in 
each 
of 
the 
foremost 
capitalist 
countries 
have 
achieved 
the 
“personal 
union” 
of 
industrial 
and 
bank 
capital, 
and 
have 
concentrated 
in 
their 
hands 
the 
power 
to 
dispose 
of 
thousands 
upon 
thousands 
of 
millions 
which 
form 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
capital 
and 
revenue 
of 
entire 
countries. 
A 
financial 
oligarchy, 
which 
throws 
a 
close 
net 
of 
relations 
of 
dependence 
over 
all 
the 
economic 
and 
political 
institutions 
of 
contemporary 
bourgeois 
society 
without 
exception—such 
is 
the 
most 
striking 

manifestation 
of 
this 
monopoly. 


4) 
Monopoly 
has 
grown 
out 
of 
colonial 
policy. 
To 
the 
numerous 
“old” 
motives 
of 
colonial 
policy, 
finance 
capital 
has 
added 
the 
struggle 
for 
the 
sources 
of 
raw 
materials, 
for 
the 
export 
of 
capital, 
for 
“spheres 
of 
influence,” 
i.e., 
for 
spheres 
of 
good 
business, 
concessions, 
monopolist 
profits, 
and 
so 
on; 
in 
fine, 
for 
economic 
territory 
in 
general. 
When 
the 
colonies 
of 
the 
European 
powers 
in 
Africa 
comprised 
only 
one-tenth 
of 
that 
territory 
(as 
was 
the 
case 
in 
1876), 
colonial 
policy 
was 
able 
to 
develop 
by 
methods 
other 
than 
those 
of 
monopoly—by 
the 
“free 
grabbing” 
of 
territories, 
so 
to 
speak. 
But 
when 
nine-
tenths 
of 
Africa 
had 
been 
seized 
(approximately 
in 
1900), 
when 
the 
whole 
world 
had 
been 
shared 
out, 
there 
was 
inevitably 
ushered 
in 
a 
period 
of 
colonial 
monopoly 
and, 
consequently, 
a 
period 
of 
intense 
struggle 
for 
the 
partition 
and 
the 
repartition 
of 
the 
world. 
The 
extent 
to 
which 
monopolist 
capital 
has 
intensified 
all 
the 
contradictions 
of 
capitalism 
is 
generally 
known. 
It 
is 
sufficient 
to 
mention 
the 
high 
cost 
of 
living 
and 
the 
power 
of 
the 
trusts. 
This 
intensification 
of 
contradictions 
constitutes 
the 
most 
powerful 
driving 
force 
of 
the 
transitional 
period 
of 
history, 
which 
began 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
definite 
victory 
of 
world 
finance 
capital. 


Monopolies, 
oligarchy, 
the 
striving 
for 
domination 
instead 
of 
the 
striving 
for 
liberty, 
the 
exploitation 
of 
an 
increasing 
number 
of 
small 
or 
weak 
nations 
by 
an 
extremely 
small 
group 
of 
the 
richest 
or 
most 
powerful 
nations—all 
these 
have 
given 
birth 
to 
those 
distinctive 
features 
of 
imperialism 
which 
compel 
us 
to 
define 
it 
as 
parasitic 
or 
decaying 
capitalism. 
More 
and 
more 
there 
emerges, 
as 
one 
of 
the 
tendencies 
of 
imperialism, 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
“bondholding” 
(rentier) 
state, 
the 
usurer 
state, 
in 
which 
the 
bourgeoisie 
lives 
on 
the 
proceeds 
of 
capital 
exports 
and 
by 
“clipping 
coupons.” 
It 
would 
be 
a 
mistake 
to 
believe 
that 
this 
tendency 
to 
decay 
precludes 
the 
possibility 
of 
the 
rapid 
growth 
of 
capitalism. 
It 
does 
not. 
In 
the 
epoch 
of 
imperialism, 
certain 
branches 
of 
industry, 
certain 
strata 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie 
and 
certain 
countries 
betray, 
to 
a 
greater 
or 
less 
degree, 
one 
or 
other 
of 
these 
tendencies. 
On 
the 
whole 
capitalism 
is 
growing 
far 
more 
rapidly 
than 
before, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
only 
that 
this 
growth 
is 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
uneven; 
this 
unevenness 
manifests 
itself 
also, 
in 
particular, 
in 
the 
decay 
of 
the 
countries 
which 
are 
richest 
in 
capital 
(such 
as 
England). 


In 
regard 
to 
the 
rapidity 
of 
Germany’s 
economic 
development, 
Riesser, 
the 
author 
of 
the 
book 
on 
the 
great 
German 
banks, 
states: 



“The 
progress 
of 
the 
preceding 
period 
(1848-70), 
which 
had 
not 
been 
exactly 
slow, 
stood 
in 
about 
the 
same 
ratio 
to 
the 
rapidity 
with 
which 
the 
whole 
of 
Germany’s 
national 
economy 
and 
with 
it 
German 
banking 
progressed 
during 
this 
period 
(1870-1905), 
as 
the 
mail 
coach 
of 
the 
Holy 
Roman 
Empire 
of 
the 
German 
nation 
stood 
to 
the 
speed 
of 
the 
present-day 
automobile 
... 
which 
in 
whizzing 
past, 
it 
must 
be 
said, 
often 
endangers 
not 
only 
innocent 
pedestrians 
in 
its 
path, 
but 
also 
the 
occupants 
of 
the 
car.” 


In 
its 
turn, 
this 
finance 
capital 
which 
has 
grown 
so 
rapidly 
is 
not 
unwilling 
(precisely 
because 
it 
has 
grown 
so 
quickly) 
to 
pass 
on 
to 
a 
more 
“tranquil” 
possession 
of 
colonies 
which 
have 
to 
be 
captured—and 
not 
only 
by 
peaceful 
methods—from 
richer 
nations. 
In 
the 
United 
States, 
economic 
development 
in 
the 
last 
decades 
has 
been 
even 
more 
rapid 
than 
in 
Germany, 
and 
for 
this 
very 
reason 
the 
parasitic 
character 
of 
modern 
American 
capitalism 
has 
stood 
out 
with 
particular 
prominence. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
a 
comparison 
of, 
say, 
the 
republican 
American 
bourgeoisie 
with 
the 
monarchist 
Japanese 
or 
German 
bourgeoisie 
shows 
that 
the 
most 
pronounced 
political 
differences 
become 
insignificant 
during 
the 
imperialist 
period—not 
because 
they 
are 
unimportant 
in 
general, 
but 
because 
throughout 
it 
is 
a 
case 
of 
a 
bourgeoisie 
with 
definite 
traits 
of 
parasitism. 


The 
receipt 
of 
high 
monopoly. 
profits 
by 
the 
capitalists 
in 
one 
of 
the 
numerous 
branches 
of 
industry, 
in 
one 
of 
numerous 
countries, 
etc., 
makes 
it 
economically 
possible 
for 
them 
to 
corrupt 
individual 
sections 
of 
the 
working 
class 
and 
sometimes 
a 
fairly 
considerable 
minority, 
and 
win 
them 
to 
the 
side 
of 
the 
capitalists 
of 
a 
given 
industry 
or 
nation 
against 
all 
the 
others. 
The 
intensification 
of 
antagonisms 
between 
imperialist 
nations 
for 
the 
partition 
of 
the 
world 
increases 
this 
striving. 
And 
so 
there 
is 
created 
that 
bond 
between 
imperialism 
and 
opportunism, 
which 
revealed 
itself 
first 
and 
most 
clearly 
in 
England, 
owing 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
certain 
features 
of 
imperialist 
development 
were 
observable 
there 
much 
sooner 
than 
in 
other 
countries. 


Some 
writers, 
L. 
Martov, 
for 
example, 
try 
to 
evade 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
is 
a 
connection 
between 
imperialism 
and 
opportunism 
in 
the 
labor 
movement— 
which 
is 
particularly 
striking 
at 
the 
present 
time—by 
resorting 
to 
stereotyped, 
optimistic 
arguments 
(à 
la 
Kautsky 
and 
Huysmans) 
like 
the 
following: 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
opponents 
of 
capitalism 
would 
be 
hopeless 
if 
it 
were 
precisely 
progressive 
capitalism 
that 
led 
to 
the 
increase 
of 
opportunism, 
or 
if 
it 
were 
precisely 
the 
best 
paid 
workers 
who 
were 
inclined 
towards 
opportunism, 
etc. 
We 
must 
have 
no 
illusion 
regarding 
“optimism” 
of 
this 
kind. 
It 
is 
optimism 
in 



regard 
to 
opportunism; 
it 
is 
optimism 
which 
serves 
to 
conceal 
opportunism. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
the 
extraordinary 
rapidity 
and 
the 
particularly 
revolting 
character 
of 
the 
development 
of 
opportunism 
is 
by 
no 
means 
a 
guarantee 
that 
its 
victory 
will 
be 
durable; 
the 
rapid 
growth 
of 
a 
malignant 
abscess 
on 
a 
healthy 
body 
only 
causes 
it 
to 
burst 
quickly 
and 
thus 
to 
relieve 
the 
body 
of 
it. 
The 
most 
dangerous 
people 
of 
all 
in 
this 
respect 
are 
those 
who 
do 
not 
wish 
to 
understand 
that 
the 
fight 
against 
imperialism 
is 
a 
sham 
and 
humbug 
unless 
it 
is 
inseparably 
bound 
up 
with 
the 
fight 
against 
opportunism. 


From 
all 
that 
has 
been 
said 
in 
this 
book 
on 
the 
economic 
nature 
of 
imperialism, 
it 
follows 
that 
we 
must 
define 
it 
as 
capitalism 
in 
transition, 
or, 
more 
precisely, 
as 
moribund 
capitalism. 
It 
is 
very 
instructive 
in 
this 
respect 
to 
note 
that 
the 
bourgeois 
economists, 
in 
describing 
modern 
capitalism, 
frequently 
employ 
terms 
like 
“interlocking,” 
“absence 
of 
isolation,” 
etc.; 
“in 
accordance 
with 
their 
functions 
and 
course 
of 
development,” 
banks 
are 
“not 
purely 
private 
business 
enterprises; 
they 
are 
more 
and 
more 
outgrowing 
the 
sphere 
of 
purely 
private 
business 
regulations.” 
And 
this 
very 
Riesser, 
who 
uttered 
the 
words 
just 
quoted, 
declares 
with 
all 
seriousness 
that 
the 
“prophecy” 
of 
the 
Marxists 
concerning 
“socialization” 
has 
not 
been 
realized! 


What 
then 
does 
this 
word 
“interlocking” 
express? 
It 
merely 
expresses 
the 
most 
striking 
feature 
of 
the 
process 
going 
on 
before 
our 
eyes. 
It 
shows 
that 
the 
observer 
counts 
the 
separate 
trees 
without 
seeing 
the 
wood. 
It 
slavishly 
copies 
the 
superficial, 
the 
fortuitous, 
the 
chaotic. 
It 
reveals 
the 
observer 
as 
one 
overwhelmed 
by 
the 
mass 
of 
raw 
material 
and 
utterly 
incapable 
of 
appreciating 
its 
meaning 
and 
importance. 
Ownership 
of 
shares 
and 
relations 
between 
owners 
of 
private 
property 
“interlock 
in 
a 
haphazard 
way.” 
But 
the 
underlying 
factor 
of 
this 
interlocking, 
its 
very 
base, 
is 
the 
changing 
social 
relations 
of 
production. 
When 
a 
big 
enterprise 
assumes 
gigantic 
proportions, 
and, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
exact 
computation 
of 
mass 
data, 
organizes 
according 
to 
plan 
the 
supply 
of 
primary 
raw 
materials 
to 
the 
extent 
of 
two-thirds, 
or 
three-
fourths 
of 
all 
that 
is 
necessary 
for 
tens 
of 
millions 
of 
people; 
when 
these 
raw 
materials 
are 
transported 
to 
the 
most 
suitable 
place 
of 
production, 
sometimes 
hundreds 
or 
thousands 
of 
miles 
away, 
in 
a 
systematic 
and 
organized 
manner; 
when 
a 
single 
cehter 
directs 
all 
the 
successive 
stages 
of 
work 
right 
up 
to 
the 
manufacture 
of 
numerous 
varieties 
of 
finished 
articles; 
when 
these 
products 
are 
distributed 
according 
to 
a 
single 
plan 
among 
tens 
of 
hundreds 
of 
millions 
of 
consumers 
(as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
distribution 
of 
oil 
in 
America 
and 
Germany 
by 
the 
American 
“Standard 
Oil”)—then 
it 
becomes 
evident 
that 
we 



have 
socialization 
of 
production, 
and 
not 
mere 
“interlocking”; 
that 
private 
economic 
relations 
and 
private 
property 
relations 
constitute 
a 
shell 
which 
is 
no 
longer 
suitable 
for 
its 
contents, 
a 
shell 
which 
must 
of 
necessity 
begin 
to 
decay 
if 
its 
destruction 
be 
postponed 
by 
artificial 
means; 
a 
shell 
which 
may 
continue 
in 
a 
state 
of 
decay 
for 
a 
fairly 
long 
period 
(particularly 
if 
the 
cure 
of 
the 
opportunist 
abscess 
is 
protracted), 
but 
which 
must 
inevitably 
be 
removed. 


The 
enthusiastic 
admirer 
of 
German 
imperialism, 
Schulze-Gavernitz, 
exclaims: 


“Once 
the 
supreme 
management 
of 
the 
German 
banks 
has 
been 
entrusted 
to 
the 
hands 
of 
a 
dozen 
persons, 
their 
activity 
is 
even 
today 
more 
significant 
for 
the 
public 
good 
than 
that 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
Ministers 
of 
State.” 
(The 
“interlocking” 
of 
bankers, 
ministers, 
magnates 
of 
industry 
and 
bondholders, 
is 
here 
conveniently 
forgotten.) 
“If 
we 
conceive 
of 
the 
tendencies 
of 
development 
which 
we 
have 
noted 
as 
realized 
to 
the 
utmost: 
the 
money 
capital 
of 
the 
nation 
united 
in 
the 
banks; 
the 
banks 
themselves 
combined 
in 
cartels; 
the 
investment 
capital 
of 
the 
nation 
cast 
in 
the 
shape 
of 
securities, 
then 
the 
brilliant 
forecast 
of 
Saint-Simon 
will 
be 
fulfilled. 
‘The 
present 
anarchy 
of 
production 
caused 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
economic 
relations 
are 
developing 
without 
uniform 
regulation 
must 
make 
way 
for 
organization 
in 
production. 
Production 
will 
no 
longer 
be 
shaped 
by 
isolated 
manufacturers, 
independent 
of 
each 
other 
and 
ignorant 
of 
man’s 
economic 
needs, 
but 
by 
a 
social 
institution. 
A 
central 
body 
of 
management, 
able 
to 
survey 
the 
large 
fields 
of 
social 
economy 
from 
a 
more 
elevated 
point 
of 
view, 
will 
regulate 
it 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
society, 
will 
be 
able 
to 
put 
the 
means 
of 
production 
into 
suitable 
hands, 
and 
above 
all 
will 
take 
care 
that 
there 
be 
constant 
harmony 
between 
production 
and 
consumption. 
Institutions 
already 
exist 
which 
have 
assumed 
as 
part 
of 
their 
task 
a 
certain 
organization 
of 
economic 
labor: 
the 
banks.’ 
The 
fulfilment 
of 
the 
forecasts 
of 
Saint-Simon 
still 
lies 
in 
the 
future, 
but 
we 
are 
on 
the 
way 
to 
its 
fulfilment—Marxism, 
different 
from 
what 
Marx 
imagined, 
but 
different 
only 
in 
form.” 


A 
crushing 
“refutation” 
of 
Marx, 
indeed! 
It 
is 
a 
retreat 
from 
Marx’s 
precise, 
scientific 
analysis 
to 
Saint-Simon’s 
guesswork, 
the 
guesswork 
of 
a 
genius, 
but 
guesswork 
all 
the 
same.

a 
Bolshevik 
social, 
political 
and 
literary 
monthly 
published 
legally 
in 
St. 
Petersburg 
from 
December 
1911 
onwards. 
Its 
inauguration 
was 
proposed 
by 
Lenin 
to 
replace 
the 
Bolshevik 
journal 
Mysl 
(Thought), 
a 
Moscow 
publication 
banned 
by 
the 
tsarist 
government. 
Lenin 
directed 
the 
work 
of 
the 
journal 
from 
abroad 
and 
wrote 
the 
following 
articles 
for 
it: 
“Fundamental 
Problems 
of 
the 
Election 
Campaign”, 
“Results 
of 
the 
Election”, 
“Critical 
Remarks 
on 
the 
National 
Question”, 
“The 
Right 
of 
Nations 
to 
Self-Determination”, 
and 
others. 


The 
journal 
was 
suppressed 
by 
the 
tsarist 
government 
in 
June 
1914, 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
the 
First 
World 
War. 
Publication 
was 
resumed 
in 
the 
autumn 
of 
1917 
but 
only 
one 
double 
number 
appeared; 
this 
number 
contained 
two 
articles 
by 
Lenin: 
“Can 
the 
Bolsheviks 
Retain 
State 
Power?” 
and 
“A 
Review 
of 
the 
Party 
Programme”. 


Throughout 
the 
civilised 
world 
the 
teachings 
of 
Marx 
evoke 
the 
utmost 
hostility 
and 
hatred 
of 
all 
bourgeois 
science 
(both 
official 
and 
liberal), 
which 
regards 
Marxism 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
“pernicious 
sect”. 
And 
no 
other 
attitude 
is 
to 
be 
expected, 
for 
there 
can 
be 
no 
“impartial” 
social 
science 
in 
a 
society 
based 
on 
class 
struggle. 
In 
one 
way 
or 
another, 
all 
official 
and 
liberal 
science 
defends 
wage-slavery, 
whereas 
Marxism 
has 
declared 
relentless 
war 
on 
that 
slavery. 
To 
expect 
science 
to 
be 
impartial 
in 
a 
wage-slave 
society 
is 
as 
foolishly 
naïve 
as 
to 
expect 
impartiality 
from 
manufacturers 
on 
the 
question 
of 
whether 
workers’ 
wages 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
increased 
by 
decreasing 
the 
profits 
of 
capital. 


But 
this 
is 
not 
all. 
The 
history 
of 
philosophy 
and 
the 
history 
of 
social 
science 
show 
with 
perfect 
clarity 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
resembling 
“sectarianism” 
in 
Marxism, 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
its 
being 
a 
hidebound, 
petrified 
doctrine, 
a 
doctrine 
which 
arose 
away 
from 
the 
high 
road 
of 
the 
development 
of 
world 
civilisation. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
genius 
of 
Marx 
consists 
precisely 
in 
his 
having 
furnished 
answers 
to 
questions 
already 
raised 
by 
the 
foremost 
minds 
of 
mankind. 
His 
doctrine 
emerged 
as 
the 
direct 
and 
immediate 
continuation 
of 
the 
teachings 
of 
the 
greatest 
representatives 
of 
philosophy, 
political 
economy 
and 
socialism. 


The 
Marxist 
doctrine 
is 
omnipotent 
because 
it 
is 
true. 
It 
is 
comprehensive 
and 
harmonious, 
and 
provides 
men 
with 
an 
integral 
world 
outlook 



irreconcilable 
with 
any 
form 
of 
superstition, 
reaction, 
or 
defence 
of 
bourgeois 
oppression. 
It 
is 
the 
legitimate 
successor 
to 
the 
best 
that 
man 
produced 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
as 
represented 
by 
German 
philosophy, 
English 
political 
economy 
and 
French 
socialism. 


It 
is 
these 
three 
sources 
of 
Marxism, 
which 
are 
also 
its 
component 
parts 
that 
we 
shall 
outline 
in 
brief. 


I 


The 
philosophy 
of 
Marxism 
is 
materialism. 
Throughout 
the 
modern 
history 
of 
Europe, 
and 
especially 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
century 
in 
France, 
where 
a 
resolute 
struggle 
was 
conducted 
against 
every 
kind 
of 
medieval 
rubbish, 
against 
serfdom 
in 
institutions 
and 
ideas, 
materialism 
has 
proved 
to 
be 
the 
only 
philosophy 
that 
is 
consistent, 
true 
to 
all 
the 
teachings 
of 
natural 
science 
and 
hostile 
to 
superstition, 
cant 
and 
so 
forth. 
The 
enemies 
of 
democracy 
have, 
therefore, 
always 
exerted 
all 
their 
efforts 
to 
“refute”, 
under 
mine 
and 
defame 
materialism, 
and 
have 
advocated 
various 
forms 
of 
philosophical 
idealism, 
which 
always, 
in 
one 
way 
or 
another, 
amounts 
to 
the 
defence 
or 
support 
of 
religion. 


Marx 
and 
Engels 
defended 
philosophical 
materialism 
in 
the 
most 
determined 
manner 
and 
repeatedly 
explained 
how 
profoundly 
erroneous 
is 
every 
deviation 
from 
this 
basis. 
Their 
views 
are 
most 
clearly 
and 
fully 
expounded 
in 
the 
works 
of 
Engels, 
Ludwig 
Feuerbach 
and 
Anti-Dühring, 
which, 
like 
the 
Communist 
Manifesto, 
are 
handbooks 
for 
every 
class-
conscious 
worker. 


But 
Marx 
did 
not 
stop 
at 
eighteenth-century 
materialism: 
he 
developed 
philosophy 
to 
a 
higher 
level, 
he 
enriched 
it 
with 
the 
achievements 
of 
German 
classical 
philosophy, 
especially 
of 
Hegel’s 
system, 
which 
in 
its 
turn 
had 
led 
to 
the 
materialism 
of 
Feuerbach. 
The 
main 
achievement 
was 
dialectics, 
i.e., 
the 
doctrine 
of 
development 
in 
its 
fullest, 
deepest 
and 
most 
comprehensive 
form, 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
relativity 
of 
the 
human 
knowledge 
that 
provides 
us 
with 
a 
reflection 
of 
eternally 
developing 
matter. 
The 
latest 
discoveries 
of 
natural 
science-radium, 
electrons, 
the 
transmutation 
of 
elements-have 
been 
a 
remarkable 
confirmation 
of 
Marx’s 
dialectical 
materialism 
despite 
the 
teachings 
of 
the 
bourgeois 
philosophers 
with 
their 
“new” 
reversions 
to 
old 
and 
decadent 
idealism. 


Marx 
deepened 
and 
developed 
philosophical 
materialism 
to 
the 
full, 
and 
extended 
the 
cognition 
of 
nature 
to 
include 
the 
cognition 
of 
human 
society. 



His 
historical 
materialism 
was 
a 
great 
achievement 
in 
scientific 
thinking. 
The 
chaos 
and 
arbitrariness 
that 
had 
previously 
reigned 
in 
views 
on 
history 
and 
politics 
were 
replaced 
by 
a 
strikingly 
integral 
and 
harmonious 
scientific 
theory, 
which 
shows 
how, 
in 
consequence 
of 
the 
growth 
of 
productive 
forces, 
out 
of 
one 
system 
of 
social 
life 
another 
and 
higher 
system 
develops-how 
capitalism, 
for 
instance, 
grows 
out 
of 
feudalism. 


Just 
as 
man’s 
knowledge 
reflects 
nature 
(i.e., 
developing 
matter), 
which 
exists 
independently 
of 
him, 
so 
man’s 
social 
knowledge 
(i.e., 
his 
various 
views 
and 
doctrines-philosophical, 
religious, 
political 
and 
so 
forth) 
reflects 
the 
economic 
system 
of 
society. 
Political 
institutions 
are 
a 
superstructure 
on 
the 
economic 
foundation. 
We 
see, 
for 
example, 
that 
the 
various 
political 
forms 
of 
the 
modern 
European 
states 
serve 
to 
strengthen 
the 
domination 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie 
over 
the 
proletariat. 


Marx’s 
philosophy 
is 
a 
consummate 
philosophical 
materialism 
which 
has 
provided 
mankind, 
and 
especially 
the 
working 
class, 
with 
powerful 
instruments 
of 
knowledge. 


II 


Having 
recognised 
that 
the 
economic 
system 
is 
the 
foundation 
on 
which 
the 
political 
superstructure 
is 
erected, 
Marx 
devoted 
his 
greatest 
attention 
to 
the 
study 
of 
this 
economic 
system. 
Marx’s 
principal 
work, 
Capital, 
is 
devoted 
to 
a 
study 
of 
the 
economic 
system 
of 
modern, 
i.e., 
capitalist, 
society. 


Classical 
political 
economy, 
before 
Marx, 
evolved 
in 
England, 
the 
most 
developed 
of 
the 
capitalist 
countries. 
Adam 
Smith 
and 
David 
Ricardo, 
by 
their 
investigations 
of 
the 
economic 
system, 
laid 
the 
foundations 
of 
the 
labour 
theory 
of 
value. 
Marx 
continued 
their 
work; 
he 
provided 
a 
proof 
of 
the 
theory 
and 
developed 
it 
consistently. 
He 
showed 
that 
the 
value 
of 
every 
commodity 
is 
determined 
by 
the 
quantity 
of 
socially 
necessary 
labour 
time 
spent 
on 
its 
production. 


Where 
the 
bourgeois 
economists 
saw 
a 
relation 
between 
things 
(the 
exchange 
of 
one 
commodity 
for 
another) 
Marx 
revealed 
a 
relation 
between 
people. 
The 
exchange 
of 
commodities 
expresses 
the 
connection 
between 
individual 
producers 
through 
the 
market. 
Money 
signifies 
that 
the 
connection 
is 
becoming 
closer 
and 
closer, 
inseparably 
uniting 
the 
entire 
economic 
life 
of 
the 
individual 
producers 
into 
one 
whole. 
Capital 
signifies 
a 
further 
development 
of 
this 
connection: 
man’s 
labour-power 
becomes 
a 
commodity. 
The 
wage-worker 
sells 
his 
labour-power 
to 
the 
owner 
of 
land, 
factories 
and 



instruments 
of 
labour. 
The 
worker 
spends 
one 
part 
of 
the 
day 
covering 
the 
cost 
of 
maintaining 
himself 
and 
his 
family 
(wages), 
while 
the 
other 
part 
of 
the 
day 
he 
works 
without 
remuneration, 
creating 
for 
the 
capitalist 
surplus-
value, 
the 
source 
of 
profit, 
the 
source 
of 
the 
wealth 
of 
the 
capitalist 
class. 


The 
doctrine 
of 
surplus-value 
is 
the 
corner-stone 
of 
Marx’s 
economic 
theory. 


Capital, 
created 
by 
the 
labour 
of 
the 
worker, 
crushes 
the 
worker, 
ruining 
small 
proprietors 
and 
creating 
an 
army 
of 
unemployed. 
In 
industry, 
the 
victory 
of 
large-scale 
production 
is 
immediately 
apparent, 
but 
the 
same 
phenomenon 
is 
also 
to 
be 
observed 
in 
agriculture, 
where 
the 
superiority 
of 
large-scale 
capitalist 
agriculture 
is 
enhanced, 
the 
use 
of 
machinery 
increases 
and 
the 
peasant 
economy, 
trapped 
by 
money-capital, 
declines 
and 
falls 
into 
ruin 
under 
the 
burden 
of 
its 
backward 
technique. 
The 
decline 
of 
small-scale 
production 
assumes 
different 
forms 
in 
agriculture, 
but 
the 
decline 
itself 
is 
an 
indisputable 
fact. 


By 
destroying 
small-scale 
production, 
capital 
leads 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
productivity 
of 
labour 
and 
to 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
monopoly 
position 
for 
the 
associations 
of 
big 
capitalists. 
Production 
itself 
becomes 
more 
and 
more 
social-hundreds 
of 
thousands 
and 
millions 
of 
workers 
become 
bound 
together 
in 
a 
regular 
economic 
organism-but 
the 
product 
of 
this 
collective 
labour 
is 
appropriated 
by 
a 
handful 
of 
capitalists. 
Anarchy 
of 
production, 
crises, 
the 
furious 
chase 
after 
markets 
and 
the 
insecurity 
of 
existence 
of 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
population 
are 
intensified. 


By 
increasing 
the 
dependence 
of 
the 
workers 
on 
capital, 
the 
capitalist 
system 
creates 
the 
great 
power 
of 
united 
labour. 


Marx 
traced 
the 
development 
of 
capitalism 
from 
embryonic 
commodity 
economy, 
from 
simple 
exchange, 
to 
its 
highest 
forms, 
to 
large-scale 
production. 


And 
the 
experience 
of 
all 
capitalist 
countries, 
old 
and 
new, 
year 
by 
year 
demonstrates 
clearly 
the 
truth 
of 
this 
Marxian 
doctrine 
to 
increasing 
numbers 
of 
workers. 


Capitalism 
has 
triumphed 
all 
over 
the 
world, 
but 
this 
triumph 
is 
only 
the 
prelude 
to 
the 
triumph 
of 
labour 
over 
capital. 


III 


When 
feudalism 
was 
overthrown 
and 
“free” 
capitalist 
society 
appeared 
in 
the 
world, 
it 
at 
once 
became 
apparent 
that 
this 
freedom 
meant 
a 
new 
system 



of 
oppression 
and 
exploitation 
of 
the 
working 
people. 
Various 
socialist 
doctrines 
immediately 
emerged 
as 
a 
reflection 
of 
and 
protest 
against 
this 
oppression. 
Early 
socialism, 
however, 
was 
utopian 
socialism. 
It 
criticised 
capitalist 
society, 
it 
condemned 
and 
damned 
it, 
it 
dreamed 
of 
its 
destruction, 
it 
had 
visions 
of 
a 
better 
order 
and 
endeavoured 
to 
convince 
the 
rich 
of 
the 
immorality 
of 
exploitation. 


But 
utopian 
socialism 
could 
not 
indicate 
the 
real 
solution. 
It 
could 
not 
explain 
the 
real 
nature 
of 
wage-slavery 
under 
capitalism, 
it 
could 
not 
reveal 
the 
laws 
of 
capitalist 
development, 
or 
show 
what 
social 
force 
is 
capable 
of 
becoming 
the 
creator 
of 
a 
new 
society. 


Meanwhile, 
the 
stormy 
revolutions 
which 
everywhere 
in 
Europe, 
and 
especially 
in 
France, 
accompanied 
the 
fall 
of 
feudalism, 
of 
serfdom, 
more 
and 
more 
clearly 
revealed 
the 
struggle 
of 
classes 
as 
the 
basis 
and 
the 
driving 
force 
of 
all 
development. 


Not 
a 
single 
victory 
of 
political 
freedom 
over 
the 
feudal 
class 
was 
won 
except 
against 
desperate 
resistance. 
Not 
a 
single 
capitalist 
country 
evolved 
on 
a 
more 
or 
less 
free 
and 
democratic 
basis 
except 
by 
a 
life-and-death 
struggle 
between 
the 
various 
classes 
of 
capitalist 
society. 


The 
genius 
of 
Marx 
lies 
in 
his 
having 
been 
the 
first 
to 
deduce 
from 
this 
the 
lesson 
world 
history 
teaches 
and 
to 
apply 
that 
lesson 
consistently. 
The 
deduction 
he 
made 
is 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
class 
struggle. 


People 
always 
have 
been 
the 
foolish 
victims 
of 
deception 
and 
self-
deception 
in 
politics, 
and 
they 
always 
will 
be 
until 
they 
have 
learnt 
to 
seek 
out 
the 
interests 
of 
some 
class 
or 
other 
behind 
all 
moral, 
religious, 
political 
and 
social 
phrases, 
declarations 
and 
promises. 
Champions 
of 
reforms 
and 
improvements 
will 
always 
be 
fooled 
by 
the 
defenders 
of 
the 
old 
order 
until 
they 
realise 
that 
every 
old 
institution, 
how 
ever 
barbarous 
and 
rotten 
it 
may 
appear 
to 
be, 
is 
kept 
going 
by 
the 
forces 
of 
certain 
ruling 
classes. 
And 
there 
is 
only 
one 
way 
of 
smashing 
the 
resistance 
of 
those 
classes, 
and 
that 
is 
to 
find, 
in 
the 
very 
society 
which 
surrounds 
us, 
the 
forces 
which 
can-and, 
owing 
to 
their 
social 
position, 
must-constitute 
the 
power 
capable 
of 
sweeping 
away 
the 
old 
and 
creating 
the 
new, 
and 
to 
enlighten 
and 
organise 
those 
forces 
for 
the 
struggle. 


Marx’s 
philosophical 
materialism 
alone 
has 
shown 
the 
proletariat 
the 
way 
out 
of 
the 
spiritual 
slavery 
in 
which 
all 
oppressed 
classes 
have 
hitherto 
languished. 
Marx’s 
economic 
theory 
alone 
has 
explained 
the 
true 
position 
of 
the 
proletariat 
in 
the 
general 
system 
of 
capitalism. 



Independent 
organisations 
of 
the 
proletariat 
are 
multi 
plying 
all 
over 
the 
world, 
from 
America 
to 
Japan 
and 
from 
Sweden 
to 
South 
Africa. 
The 
proletariat 
is 
becoming 
enlightened 
and 
educated 
by 
waging 
its 
class 
struggle; 
it 
is 
ridding 
itself 
of 
the 
prejudices 
of 
bourgeois 
society; 
it 
is 
rallying 
its 
ranks 
ever 
more 
closely 
and 
is 
learning 
to 
gauge 
the 
measure 
of 
its 
successes; 
it 
is 
steeling 
its 
forces 
and 
is 
growing 
irresistibly.

The 
Provisional 
Government 
has 
been 
deposed. 
State 
power 
has 
passed 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
organ 
of 
the 
Petrograd 
Soviet 
of 
Workers' 
and 
Soldiers' 
Deputies-the 
Revolutionary 
Military 
Committee, 
which 
heads 
the 
Petrograd 
proletariat 
and 
the 
garrison. 


The 
cause 
for 
which 
the 
people 
have 
fought, 
namely, 
the 
immediate 
offer 
of 
a 
democratic 
peace, 
the 
abolition 
of 
landed 
proprietorship, 
workers'control 
over 
production, 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
Soviet 
power 
-this 
cause 
has 
been 
secured. 


Long 
live 
the 
revolution 
of 
workers, 
soldiers 
and 
peasants!

To 
Workers, 
Soldiers, 
and 
Peasants! 


The 
Second 
All-Russia 
Congress 
of 
Soviets 
of 
Workers 
and 
Soldiers' 
Deputies 
has 
opened. 
The 
vast 
majority 
of 
the 
Soviets 
are 
represented 
at 
the 
Congress. 
A 
number 
of 
delegates 
from 
the 
Peasants' 
Soviets 
are 
also 
present. 
The 
mandate 
of 
the 
compromising 
Central 
Executive 
Committee 
has 
terminated.[43] 
Backed 
by 
the 
will 
of 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
the 
wokers, 
soldiers, 
and 
peasants, 
backed 
by 
the 
victorious 
uprising 
of 
the 
wokres 
and 
the 
garrison 
which 
has 
taken 
place 
in 
Petrograd, 
the 
Congress 
takes 
power 
into 
its 
own 
hands. 


The 
Provisional 
Government 
has 
been 
overthrown. 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
members 
of 
the 
Provisional 
Government 
have 
already 
been 
arrested. 


The 
Soviet 
government 
will 
propose 
an 
immediate 
democratic 
peace 
to 
all 
the 
nations 
and 
an 
immediate 
armistice 
on 
all 
fronts. 
It 
will 
secure 
the 
transfer 
of 
the 
land 
of 
the 
landed 
proprietors, 
the 
crown 
and 
the 
monasteries 
to 
the 
peasant 
committees 
wihout 
compensation; 
it 
will 
protect 
the 
rights 
of 
the 
soldiers 
by 
introducting 
complete 
democracy 
in 
the 
army; 
it 
will 
establish 
workers' 
control 
over 
production; 
it 
will 
ensure 
the 
convocation 
of 
the 
Constituent 
Assembly 
at 
the 
time 
appointed; 
it 
will 
see 
to 
it 
that 
bread 
is 
supplied 
to 
the 
cities 
and 
prime 
necessities 
to 
the 
villages; 
it 
will 
guarantee 
all 
the 
nations 
inhabiting 
Russia 
the 
genuine 
right 
to 
self-determination. 


The 
Congress 
decrees: 
all 
power 
in 
the 
localities 
shall 
pass 
to 
the 
Soviets 
of 
Workers', 
Soldiers' 
and 
Peasants' 
Deputies, 
which 
must 
guarantee 
genuine 
revolutionary 
order. 


The 
Congress 
calls 
upon 
the 
soldiers 
in 
the 
trenches 
to 
be 
vigilant 
and 
firm. 
The 
Congress 
of 
Soviets 
is 
convinced 
that 
the 
revolutionary 
army 
will 
be 
able 
to 
defend 
the 
revolution 
against 
all 
attack 
of 
imperialism 
until 
such 
time 
as 
the 
new 
government 
succeeds 
in 
concluding 
a 
democratic 
peace, 
which 
it 
will 
propose 
directly 
to 
all 
peoples. 
The 
new 
government 
will 
do 
everything 
to 
fully 
supply 
the 
revolutionary 
army 
be 
means 
of 
a 
determined 
policy 
of 
requisitions 
and 
taxation 
of 
the 
propertied 
classes, 
and 
also 
will 
improve 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
soldiers' 
families. 


The 
Kornilov 
men 
-Kerensky, 
Kaledin 
and 
others 
-are 
attempting 
to 
bring 
troops 
against 
Petrograd. 
Several 
detachments, 
whom 
Kerensky 
had 
moved 
by 
deceiving 
them, 
have 
come 
over 
to 
the 
side 
of 
the 
insurgent 
people. 



Soldiers, 
actively 
resist 
Kerensky 
the 
Kornilovite! 
Be 
on 
your 
guard! 


Railwaymen, 
hold 
up 
all 
troop 
trains 
dispatched 
by 
Kerensky 
against 
Petrograd! 


Soldiers, 
workers 
in 
factory 
and 
office, 
the 
fate 
of 
the 
revolution 
and 
the 
fate 
of 
the 
democratic 
peace 
is 
in 
your 
hands! 


Long 
live 
the 
revolution!

Report 
on 
Peace 


The 
question 
of 
peace 
is 
a 
burning 
question, 
the 
painful 
question 
of 
the 
day. 
Much 
has 
been 
said 
and 
written 
on 
the 
subject, 
and 
all 
of 
you, 
no 
doubt, 
have 
discussed 
it 
quite 
a 
lot. 
Permit 
me, 
therefore, 
to 
proceed 
to 
read 
a 
declaration 
which 
the 
government 
you 
elect 
should 
publish. 


Decree 
on 
Peace 


The 
workers' 
and 
peasants' 
government, 
created 
by 
the 
Revolution 
of 
October 
24-25 
and 
basing 
itself 
on 
the 
Soviet 
of 
Workers', 
Soldiers' 
and 
Peasants' 
Deputies, 
calls 
upon 
all 
the 
belligerent 
peoples 
and 
their 
government 
to 
start 
immediate 
negotiations 
for 
a 
just, 
democratic 
peace. 


By 
a 
just 
or 
democratic 
peace, 
for 
which 
the 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
the 
working 
class 
and 
other 
working 
people 
of 
all 
the 
belligerent 
countries, 
exhausted, 
tormented 
and 
racked 
by 
the 
war, 
are 
craving 
-a 
peace 
that 
has 
been 
most 
definitely 
and 
insistently 
demanded 
by 
the 
Russian 
workers 
and 
peasants 
ever 
since 
the 
overthrow 
of 
the 
tsarist 
monarchy 
-by 
such 
a 
peace 
the 
government 
means 
an 
immediate 
peace 
without 
annexations 
(i.e., 
without 
the 
seizure 
of 
foreign 
lands, 
without 
the 
forcible 
incorporation 
of 
foreign 
nations) 
and 
without 
indemnities. 


The 
government 
of 
Russia 
proposes 
that 
this 
kind 
of 
peace 
be 
immediately 
concluded 
by 
all 
the 
belligerent 
nations, 
and 
expresses 
its 
readiness 
to 
take 
all 
the 
resolute 
measures 
now, 
without 
the 
least 
delay, 
pending 
the 
final 
ratification 
of 
all 
the 
terms 
of 
such 
a 
peace 
by 
authoritative 
assemblies 
of 
the 
people's 
representatives 
of 
all 
countries 
and 
all 
nations. 


In 
accordance 
with 
the 
sense 
of 
justice 
of 
democrats 
in 
general, 
and 
of 
the 
working 
class 
in 
particular, 
the 
government 
conceives 
the 
annexation 
of 
seizure 
of 
foreign 
lands 
to 
mean 
every 
incorporation 
of 
a 
small 
or 
weak 
nation 
into 
large 
or 
powerful 
state 
without 
the 
precisely, 
clearly, 
and 
voluntarily 
expressed 
consent 
and 
wish 
of 
that 
nation, 
irrespective 
of 
the 
time 
when 
such 
forcible 
incorporation 
took 
place, 
irrespective 
also 
of 
the 
degree 
of 
development 
or 
backwardness 
of 
the 
nation 
forcibly 
annexed 
to 
the 
given 
state, 
or 
forcibly 
retained 
within 
its 
borders, 
and 
irrespective, 
finally, 
of 
whether 
this 
nation 
is 
in 
Europe 
or 
in 
distant, 
overseas 
countries. 


If 
any 
nation 
whatsoever 
is 
forcibly 
retained 
within 
the 
borders 
of 
a 
given 
state, 
if, 
in 
spite 
of 
its 
expressed 
desire 
-no 
matter 
whether 
expressed 
in 
the 



press, 
at 
public 
meetings, 
in 
the 
decisions 
of 
parties, 
or 
in 
protests 
and 
uprisings 
against 
national 
oppression 
-is 
not 
accorded 
the 
right 
to 
decide 
the 
forms 
of 
its 
state 
existence 
by 
a 
free 
vote, 
taken 
after 
the 
complete 
evacuation 
of 
the[44] 
troops 
of 
the 
incorporating 
or, 
generally, 
of 
the 
stronger 
nation 
and 
without 
the 
least 
pressure 
being 
brought 
to 
bear, 
such 
incorporation 
is 
annexation, 
i.e., 
seizure 
and 
violence. 


The 
government 
considers 
it 
the 
greatest 
of 
crimes 
against 
humanity 
to 
continue 
this 
war 
over 
the 
issue 
of 
how 
to 
divide 
among 
the 
strong 
and 
rich 
nations 
the 
weak 
nationalities 
they 
have 
conquered, 
and 
solemnly 
announces 
its 
determination 
immediately 
to 
sign 
terms 
of 
peace 
to 
stop 
this 
war 
on 
the 
terms 
indicated, 
which 
are 
equally 
just 
for 
all 
nationalities 
without 
exception. 


At 
the 
same 
time 
the 
government 
declares 
that 
it 
does 
not 
regard 
the 
above-mentioned 
peace 
terms 
as 
an 
ultimatum; 
in 
other 
words, 
it 
is 
prepared 
to 
consider 
any 
other 
peace 
terms, 
and 
insists 
only 
that 
they 
be 
advanced 
by 
any 
of 
the 
belligerent 
countries 
as 
speedily 
as 
possible, 
and 
that 
in 
the 
peace 
proposals 
there 
should 
be 
absolute 
clarity 
and 
the 
complete 
absence 
of 
all 
ambiguity 
and 
secrecy. 


The 
government 
abolishes 
secret 
diplomacy, 
and, 
for 
its 
part, 
announces 
its 
firm 
intention 
to 
conduct 
all 
negotiations 
quite 
openly 
in 
full 
view 
of 
the 
whole 
people. 
It 
will 
proceed 
immediately 
with 
the 
full 
publication 
of 
the 
secret 
treaties 
endorsed 
or 
concluded 
by 
the 
government 
of 
land-owners 
and 
capitalists 
from 
February 
to 
October 
25, 
1917.[45] 
The 
government 
proclaims 
the 
unconditional 
and 
immediate 
annulment 
of 
everything 
contained 
in 
these 
secret 
treaties 
insofar 
as 
it 
is 
aimed, 
as 
is 
mostly 
the 
case, 
at 
securing 
advantages 
and 
privileges 
for 
the 
Russian 
landowners 
and 
capitalists 
and 
at 
the 
retention, 
or 
extension, 
of 
the 
annexations 
made 
by 
the 
Great 
Russians.[46] 


Proposing 
to 
the 
governments 
and 
peoples 
of 
all 
countries 
immediately 
to 
begin 
open 
negotiations 
for 
peace, 
the 
government, 
for 
its 
part, 
expresses 
its 
readiness 
to 
conduct 
these 
negotiations 
in 
writing, 
by 
telegraph, 
and 
by 
negotiations 
between 
representatives 
of 
the 
various 
countries, 
or 
at 
a 
conference 
of 
such 
representatives. 
In 
order 
to 
faciliate 
such 
negotiations, 
the 
government 
is 
appointing 
its 
plenipotentiary 
representative 
to 
neutral 
countries. 


The 
government 
proposes 
an 
immediate 
armistice 
to 
the 
governments 
and 
people 
of 
all 
the 
belligerent 
countries, 
and, 
for 
its 
part, 
considers 
it 
desirable 
that 
this 
armistice 
should 
be 
concluded 
for 
a 
period 
of 
not 
less 
than 
three 
months, 
i.e., 
a 
period 
long 
enough 
to 
permit 
the 
competition 
of 
negotiations 



for 
peace 
with 
the 
participation 
of 
the 
representatives 
of 
all 
peoples 
or 
nations, 
without 
exception, 
involved 
in 
or 
compelled 
to 
take 
part 
in 
the 
war, 
and 
the 
summoning 
of 
authoritative 
assemblies 
of 
the 
representatives 
of 
the 
peoples 
of 
all 
countries 
for 
the 
final 
ratification 
of 
the 
peace 
terms. 


While 
addressing 
this 
proposal 
for 
peace 
to 
the 
governments 
and 
peoples 
of 
all 
the 
belligerent 
countries, 
the 
Provisional 
Workers' 
and 
Peasants' 
Government 
of 
Russia 
appeals 
in 
particular 
also 
to 
the 
class-conscious 
workers 
of 
the 
three 
most 
advanced 
nations 
of 
mankind 
and 
the 
largest 
states 
participating 
in 
the 
present 
way, 
namely, 
Great 
Britain, 
France, 
and 
Germany. 
The 
workers 
of 
these 
countries 
have 
made 
the 
greatest 
contributions 
to 
the 
cause 
of 
progress 
and 
socialism; 
they 
have 
furnished 
the 
great 
examples 
of 
the 
Chartist 
movement 
in 
England, 
a 
number 
of 
revolutions 
of 
historic 
importance 
effected 
by 
the 
French 
proletariat, 
and, 
finally, 
the 
heroic 
struggle 
against 
the 
Anti-Socialist 
Law 
in 
Germany, 
and 
the 
prolonged, 
persistent 
and 
disciplined 
work 
of 
creating 
mass 
proletarian 
organisations 
in 
Germany, 
a 
work 
which 
serves 
as 
a 
model 
to 
the 
workers 
of 
the 
whole 
world. 
All 
these 
examples 
of 
proletarian 
heroism 
and 
historical 
creative 
work 
are 
a 
pledge 
that 
the 
workers 
of 
the 
countries 
mentioned 
will 
understand 
the 
duty 
that 
now 
faces 
them 
of 
saving 
mankind 
from 
the 
horrors 
of 
war 
and 
its 
consequences, 
that 
these 
workers, 
by 
comprehensive, 
determined, 
and 
supremely 
vigourous 
action, 
will 
help 
us 
to 
conclude 
peace 
successfully, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
emancipate 
the 
labouring 
and 
exploited 
masses 
of 
our 
population 
from 
all 
forms 
of 
slavery 
and 
all 
forms 
of 
exploitation. 


*** 


The 
workers' 
and 
peasants' 
government, 
created 
by 
the 
Revolution 
of 
October 
24-25 
and 
basing 
itself 
on 
the 
support 
of 
the 
Soviets 
of 
Workers', 
Soldiers', 
and 
Peasants' 
Deputies, 
must 
start 
immediate 
negotiations 
for 
peace. 
Our 
appeal 
must 
be 
addressed 
both 
to 
the 
governments 
and 
to 
the 
peoples. 
We 
cannot 
ignore 
the 
governments, 
for 
that 
would 
delay 
the 
possibility 
of 
concluding 
peace, 
and 
the 
people's 
government 
dare 
not 
do 
that; 
but 
we 
have 
no 
right 
not 
to 
appeal 
to 
the 
peoples 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
Everywhere 
there 
are 
differences 
between 
the 
governments 
and 
the 
peoples, 
and 
we 
must 
therefore 
help 
the 
peoples 
to 
intervene 
in 
questions 
of 
war 
and 
peace. 
We 
will, 
of 
course, 
insist 
upon 
the 
whole 
of 
our 
programme 
for 
a 
peace 
without 
annexations 
and 
indemnities. 
We 
shall 
not 
retreat 
from 
it; 
but 
we 
must 
not 
give 
our 
enemies 
an 
opportunity 
to 
say 
that 
their 
conditions 
are 



different 
from 
ours 
and 
that 
therefore 
it 
is 
useless 
to 
start 
negotiations 
with 
us. 
No, 
we 
must 
deprive 
them 
of 
that 
advantageous 
position 
and 
not 
present 
our 
terms 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
ultimatum. 
Therefore 
the 
point 
is 
included 
that 
we 
are 
willing 
to 
consider 
any 
peace 
terms 
and 
all 
proposals. 
We 
shall 
consider 
them, 
but 
that 
does 
not 
necessarily 
mean 
that 
we 
shall 
accept 
them. 
We 
shall 
submit 
them 
for 
consideration 
to 
the 
Constituent 
Assembly 
which 
will 
have 
the 
power 
to 
decide 
what 
concessions 
can 
and 
what 
cannot 
be 
made. 
We 
are 
combating 
the 
deception 
practised 
by 
governments 
which 
pay 
lip-service 
to 
peace 
and 
justice, 
but 
in 
fact 
wage 
annexationist 
and 
predatory 
wars. 
No 
government 
will 
say 
all 
it 
thinks. 
We, 
however, 
are 
opposed 
to 
secret 
diplomacy 
and 
will 
act 
openly 
in 
full 
view 
of 
the 
whole 
people. 
We 
do 
not 
close 
our 
eyes 
to 
difficulties 
and 
never 
have 
done 
so. 
War 
cannot 
be 
ended 
by 
refusal, 
it 
cannot 
be 
ended 
by 
one 
side. 
We 
are 
proposing 
an 
armistice 
for 
three 
months, 
but 
shall 
not 
reject 
a 
shorter 
period, 
so 
that 
the 
exhausted 
army 
may 
breathe 
freely, 
even 
if 
only 
for 
a 
little 
while; 
moreover, 
in 
all 
the 
civilised 
countries 
national 
assemblies 
must 
be 
summoned 
for 
the 
discussion 
of 
the 
terms. 


In 
proposing 
an 
immediate 
armistice, 
we 
appeal 
to 
the 
class-conscious 
workers 
of 
the 
countries 
that 
have 
done 
so 
much 
for 
the 
development 
of 
the 
proletarian 
movement. 
We 
appeal 
to 
the 
workers 
of 
Britain, 
where 
there 
was 
the 
Chartist 
movement, 
to 
the 
workers 
of 
France, 
who 
have 
in 
repeated 
uprisings 
displayed 
the 
strength 
of 
their 
class-consciousness, 
and 
to 
the 
workers 
of 
Germany, 
who 
waged 
the 
fight 
against 
the 
Anti-Socialist 
Law 
and 
have 
created 
powerful 
organisations. 


In 
the 
Manifesto[47] 
of 
March 
14, 
we 
called 
for 
the 
overthrow 
of 
the 
bankers, 
but, 
far 
from 
overthrowing 
our 
own 
bankers, 
we 
had 
entered 
into 
an 
alliance 
with 
them 
The 
Coalition 
Provisional 
Government. 
Now 
we 
have 
overthrown 
the 
government 
of 
the 
bankers. 


The 
governments 
and 
the 
bourgeoisie 
will 
make 
every 
effort 
to 
unite 
their 
forces 
and 
drown 
the 
workers' 
and 
peasants' 
revolution 
in 
blood. 
But 
the 
three 
years 
of 
war 
have 
been 
a 
good 
lesson 
to 
the 
masses 
-the 
Soviet 
movement 
in 
other 
countries 
and 
the 
mutiny 
in 
the 
German 
navy, 
which 
was 
crushed 
by 
the 
officer 
cadets 
of 
Wilhelm 
the 
hangman. 
Finally, 
we 
must 
remember 
that 
we 
are 
not 
living 
in 
the 
depths 
of 
Africa, 
but 
in 
Europe, 
where 
news 
can 
spread 
quickly. 


The 
workers' 
movement 
will 
triumph 
and 
will 
pave 
the 
way 
to 
peace 
and 
socialism.

Applause) 



Report 
on 
Land 


We 
maintain 
that 
the 
revolution 
has 
proved 
and 
demonstrated 
how 
important 
it 
is 
that 
the 
land 
question 
should 
be 
put 
clearly. 
The 
outbreak 
of 
the 
armed 
uprising, 
the 
second, 
October, 
Revolution, 
clearly 
proves 
that 
the 
land 
must 
be 
turned 
over 
to 
the 
peasants. 
The 
government 
that 
has 
been 
overthrown 
and 
the 
compromising 
parties 
of 
the 
Mensheviks 
and 
Socialist-
Revolutionaries 
committed 
a 
crime 
when 
they 
kept 
postponing 
the 
settlement 
of 
the 
land 
question 
on 
various 
pretexts 
and 
thereby 
brought 
the 
country 
to 
economic 
chaos 
and 
a 
peasant 
revolt. 
Their 
talk 
about 
riots 
and 
anarchy 
in 
the 
countryside 
sounds 
false, 
cowardly, 
and 
deceitful. 
Where 
and 
when 
have 
riots 
and 
anarchy 
been 
provoked 
by 
wise 
measures? 
If 
the 
government 
had 
acted 
wisely, 
and 
if 
their 
measures 
had 
met 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
poor 
peasants, 
would 
there 
have 
been 
unrest 
among 
the 
peasant 
masses? 
But 
all 
the 
measures 
of 
the 
government, 
approved 
by 
the 
Avkesentyev 
and 
Dan 
Soviets, 
went 
counter 
to 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
peasants 
and 
compelled 
them 
to 
revolt. 


Having 
provoked 
the 
revolt, 
the 
government 
raised 
a 
hue 
and 
cry 
about 
riots 
and 
anarchy, 
for 
which 
they 
themselves 
were 
responsible. 
They 
were 
going 
to 
crush 
it 
by 
blood 
and 
iron, 
but 
were 
themselves 
swept 
away 
by 
the 
armed 
uprising 
of 
the 
revolutionary 
soldiers, 
sailors 
and 
workers. 
The 
first 
duty 
of 
the 
government 
of 
the 
workers' 
and 
peasants' 
revolution 
must 
be 
to 
settle 
the 
land 
question, 
which 
can 
pacify 
and 
satisfy 
the 
vast 
masses 
of 
poor 
peasants. 
I 
shall 
read 
to 
you 
the 
clauses 
of 
a 
decree 
your 
Soviet 
Government 
must 
issue. 
In 
one 
of 
the 
clauses 
of 
this 
decree 
is 
embodied 
the 
Mandate 
to 
the 
Land 
Committees, 
compiled 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
242 
mandates 
from 
local 
Soviets 
of 
Peasants' 
Deputies. 


*** 


Decree 
on 
Land 


(1) 
Landed 
proprietorship 
is 
abolished 
forthwith 
without 
any 
compensation. 
(2) 
The 
landed 
estates, 
as 
also 
all 
crown, 
monastery, 
and 
church 
lands, 
with 
all 
their 
livestock, 
implements, 
buildings 
and 
everything 
pertaining 
thereto, 
shall 
be

of

(3) 
All 
damage 
to 
confiscated 
property, 
which 
henceforth 
belongs 
to 
the 
whole 
people, 
is 
proclaimed 
a 
grave 
crime 
to 
be 
punished 
by 
the 
revolutionary 
courts. 
The 
uyezd 
Soviets 
of 
Peasants' 
Deputies 
shall 
take 
all 
necessary 
measures 
to 
assure 
the 
observance 
of 
the 
strictest 
order 
during 
the 
confiscation 
of 
the 
landed 
estates, 
to 
determine 
the 
size 
of 
estates, 
and 
the 
particular 
estates 
subject 
to 
confiscation, 
to 
draw 
up 
exact 
inventories 
of 
all 
property 
confiscated 
and 
to 
protect 
in 
the 
strictest 
revolutionary 
way 
all 
agricultural 
enterprises 
transferred 
to 
the 
people, 
with 
all 
buildings, 
implements, 
livestock, 
stocks 
of 
produce, 
etc.

until 
a 
final

Peasant 
Mandate 
on 
the 
Land 


“The 
land 
question 
in 
its 
full 
scope 
can 
be 
settled

(1)

to 
be 
entitled 
to 
public

the 
period

the 
new 
conditions

life. 


(2) 
All 
mineral 
wealth

oil, 
coal, 
salt,

also 
all

(3) 
Lands 
on 
which 
high-level 
scientific 
farming 
is 
practised 
-orchards, 
tree-farms, 
seed 
plots, 
nurseries, 
hothouses, 
etc. 
-shall 
not 
be 
divided 
up,

farms, 
to 
be 
turned 
over 
for 
exclusive 
use 
to 
the 
state 
or 
to 
the 
communes, 
depending 
on 
the 
size 
and 
importance 
of 
such 
lands. 
Household 
land 
in 
towns 
and 
villages, 
with 
orchards 
and 
vegetable 
gardens, 
shall 
be 
reserved 
for 
the 
use

present 
owners, 
the 
size 
of 
the

(4) 
Stud

and 
poultry 
farms, 
etc., 
shall 
be 
confiscated

of 
the 
whole 
people, 
and 
pass 
into 
the 
exclusive 
use 
of 
the 
state 
or 
a 
commune, 
depending 
on 
the 
size 
and 
importance 
of 
such 
farms. 
The 
question 
of 
compensation 
shall 
be 
examined 
by 
the 
Constituent 
Assembly. 


(5) 
All 
livestock 
and 
farm 
implements 
of 
the 
confiscated 
estates 
shall 
pass 
into 
the 
exclusive 
use 
of 
the

this. 
The 
farm 
implements 
of 
peasants 
with 
little 
land 
shall 
not 
be 
subject 
to 
confiscation. 


(6) 
The 
right 
to 
use 
the 
land 
shall 
be 
accorded 
to 
all 
citizens 
of 
the 
Russian 
state 
(without 
distinction 
of 
sex) 
desiring 
to 
cultivate 
it 
by 
their 
own 
labour, 
with 
the 
help 
of 
their 
families, 
or 
in 
partnership, 
but 
only 
as 
long 
as 
they 
are 
able 
to 
cultivate 
it. 
The 
employment 
of 
hired 
labour 
is 
not 
permitted. 
In 
the 
event 
of 
the 
temporary 
physical 
disability 
of 
any 
member 
of 
a 
village 
commune 
for 
a 
period 
of 
up 
to 
two 
years, 
the 
village 
commune 
shall 
be 
obliged 
to 
assist 
him 
for 
this 
period 
by 
collectively 
cultivating 
his 
land 
until 
he 
is 
again 
able 
to 
work. 


Peasants 
who, 
owing 
to 
old 
age 
or 
ill-health, 
are 
permanently 
disabled 
and 
unable 
to 
cultivate 
the 
land 
personally, 
shall 
lose 
their 
right 
to 
the 
use 
of 
it 
but, 
in 
return, 
shall 
receive 
a 
pension 
from 
the 
state. 



(7) 
Land 
tenure 
shall 
be 
on 
a 
equality 
basis, 
i.e., 
the 
land 
shall 
be 
distributed 
among 
the 
working 
people 
in 
conformity 
with 
a 
labour 
standard 
or 
a 
subsistence 
standard, 
depending 
on 
local 
conditions. 
There 
shall 
be 
absolutely 
no 
restriction 
on 
the 
forms 
of 
land 
tenure 
household, 
farm, 
communal, 
or 
co-operative, 
as 
shall 
be 
decided 
in 
each 
individual 
village 
and 
settlement. 


(8) 
All 
land, 
when 
alienated, 
shall 
become 
part 
of 
the 
national 
land 
fund. 
Its 
distribution 
among 
the 
peasants 
shall 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
the 
local 
and 
central 
self-government 
bodies, 
from 
democratically 
organised 
village 
and 
city 
communes, 
in 
which 
there 
are 
no 
distinctions 
of 
social 
rank, 
to 
central 
regional 
government 
bodies. 
The 
land 
fund 
shall 
be 
subject 
to 
periodical 
redistribution, 
depending 
on 
the 
growth 
of 
population 
and 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
productivity 
and 
the 
scientific 
level 
of 
farming. 


When 
the 
boundaries 
of 
allotments 
are 
altered, 
the 
original 
nucleus 
of 
the 
allotment 
shall 
be 
left 
intact. 


The 
land 
of 
the 
members 
who 
leave 
the 
commune 
shall 
revert 
to 
the 
land 
fund; 
preferential 
right 
to 
such 
land 
shall 
be 
given 
to 
the 
near 
relatives 
of 
the 
members 
who 
have 
left, 
or 
to 
persons 
designated 
by 
the 
latter. 


The 
cost 
of 
fertilisers 
and 
improvements 
put 
into 
the 
land, 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
they 
have 
not 
been 
fully 
used 
up 
at 
the 
time 
the 
allotment 
is 
returned 
to 
the 
land 
fund, 
shall 
be 
compensated. 


Should 
the 
available 
land 
fund 
in 
a 
particular 
district 
prove 
inadequate 
for 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
local 
population, 
the 
surplus 
population 
shall 
be 
settled 
elsewhere. 


The 
state 
shall 
take 
upon 
itself 
the 
organisation 
of 
resettlement 
and 
shall 
bear 
the 
cost 
thereof, 
as 
wwell 
as 
the 
cost 
of 
supplying 
implements, 
etc. 


Resettlement 
shall 
be 
effected 
in 
the 
following 
order: 
landless 
peasants 
desiring 
to 
resettle, 
then 
members 
of 
the 
commune 
who 
are 
of 
vicious 
habits, 
deserters, 
and 
so 
on, 
and, 
finally, 
by 
lot 
or 
by 
agreement.” 


The 
entire 
contents 
of 
this 
Mandate, 
as 
expressing 
the 
absolute 
will 
of 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
the 
class-conscious 
peasants 
of 
all 
Russia, 
is 
proclaimed 
a 
provisional 
law, 
which, 
pending 
the 
convocation 
of 
the 
Constituent 
Assembly, 
shall 
be 
carried 
into 
effect 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
immediately, 
and 
as 



to 
certain 
of 
its 
provisions 
with 
due 
gradualness, 
as 
shall 
be 
determined 
by 
the 
uyezd 
Soviets 
of 
Peasants' 
Deputies. 


(5) 
The 
land 
of 
ordinary 
peasants 
and 
ordinary 
Cossacks 
shall 
not 
be 
confiscated. 
*** 


Voices 
are 
being 
raised 
here 
that 
the 
decree 
itself 
and 
the 
Mandate 
were 
drawn 
up 
by 
the 
Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
What 
of 
it? 
Does 
it 
matter 
who 
drew 
them 
up? 
As 
a 
democratic 
government, 
we 
cannot 
ignore 
the 
decision 
of 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
people, 
even 
though 
we 
may 
disagree 
with 
it. 
In 
the 
fire 
of 
experience, 
applying 
the 
decree 
in 
practice, 
and 
carrying 
it 
out 
local, 
the 
peasants 
will 
themselves 
realise 
where 
the 
truth 
lies. 
And 
even 
in 
the 
peasants 
continue 
to 
follow 
the 
Socialist-Revolutionaries, 
even 
if 
they 
give 
this 
party 
a 
majority 
in 
the 
Constituent 
Assembly, 
we 
shall 
still 
say 
-what 
of 
it? 


Experience 
is 
the 
best 
teacher 
and 
it 
will 
show 
who 
is 
right. 
Let 
the 
peasants 
solve 
this 
problem 
from 
one 
end 
and 
we 
shall 
solve 
it 
from 
the 
other. 
Experience 
will 
oblige 
us 
to 
draw 
together 
in 
the 
general 
stream 
of 
revolutionary 
creative 
work, 
in 
the 
elaboration 
of 
new 
state 
forms. 
We 
must 
be 
guided 
by 
experience; 
we 
must 
allow 
complete 
freedom 
to 
the 
creative 
faculties 
of 
the 
masses. 
The 
old 
government, 
which 
was 
overthrown 
by 
armed 
uprising, 
wanted 
to 
settle 
the 
land 
problem 
with 
the 
help 
of 
the 
old, 
unchanged 
tsarist 
bureaucracy. 
But 
instead 
of 
solving 
the 
problem, 
the 
bureaucracy 
only 
fought 
the 
peasants. 


The 
peasants 
have 
learned 
something 
during 
the 
eight 
months 
of 
our 
revolution; 
they 
want 
to 
settle 
all 
land 
problems 
themselves. 
We 
are 
therefore 
opposed 
to 
all 
amendments 
to 
this 
draft 
law. 
We 
want 
no 
details 
in 
it, 
for 
we 
are 
writing 
a 
decree, 
not 
a 
programme 
of 
action. 
Russia 
is 
vast, 
and 
local 
conditions 
vary. 
We 
trust 
that 
the 
peasants 
themselves 
will 
be 
able 
to 
solve 
the 
problem 
correctly, 
properly, 
better 
than 
we 
could 
do 
it. 
Whether 
they 
do 
it 
in 
our 
spirit 
or 
in 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
Socialist-Revolutionary 
programme 
is 
not 
the 
point. 
The 
point 
is 
that 
the 
peasants 
should 
be 
firmly 
assured 
that 
there 
are 
no 
more 
landowners 
in 
the 
countryside, 
that 
they 
themselves 
must 
decide 
all 
questions, 
and 
that 
they 
themselves 
must 
arrange 
their 
own 
lives.

Decree 
on 
Suppression 
of 
Hostile 
Newspapers 


In 
the 
serious 
decisive 
hour 
of 
the 
revolution, 
and 
the 
day 
immediately 
following 
it, 
the 
Provisional 
Revolutionary 
Committee 
was 
compelled 
to 
adopt 
a 
whole 
series 
of 
measures 
against 
the 
counter 
revolutionary 
press 
of 
all 
shades. 


Immediately 
on 
all 
sides 
cries 
arose 
that 
the 
new 
socialist 
authority 
was 
violating, 
in 
this 
way, 
the 
essential 
principles 
of 
its 
program 
by 
an 
attempt 
against 
the 
freedom 
of 
the 
press. 


The 
Workers' 
and 
Soldiers' 
Government 
draws 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
population 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
our 
country, 
behind 
this 
liberal 
shield, 
there 
is 
practically 
hidden 
the 
liberty 
for 
the 
richer 
class 
to 
seize 
into 
their 
hand 
the 
lion's 
share 
of 
the 
whole 
press 
and 
by 
this 
means 
to 
poison 
the 
minds 
and 
bring 
confusion 
into 
the 
consciousness 
of 
the 
masses. 


Everyone 
knows 
that 
the 
bourgeois 
press 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
powerful 
weapons 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
Especially 
in 
this 
critical 
moment 
when 
the 
new 
authority, 
that 
of 
the 
workers 
and 
peasants, 
is 
in 
process 
of 
consolidation. 
It 
was 
impossible 
to 
leave 
this 
weapon 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
enemy 
at 
a 
time 
when 
it 
is 
not 
less 
dangerous 
than 
bombs 
and 
machine 
guns. 
This 
is 
why 
temporary 
and 
extraordinary 
measures 
have 
been 
adopted 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
cutting 
off 
the 
stream 
of 
mire 
and 
calumny 
in 
which 
the 
yellow 
and 
green 
press 
would 
be 
glad 
to 
drown 
the 
young 
victory 
of 
the 
people. 


As 
soon 
as 
the 
new 
order 
will 
be 
consolidated, 
all 
administrative 
measures 
against 
the 
press 
will 
be 
suspended; 
full 
liberty 
will 
be 
given 
it 
within 
the 
limits 
of 
responsibility 
before 
the 
law, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
broadest 
and 
most 
progressive 
regulations 
in 
this 
respect. 


Bearing 
in 
mind, 
however, 
the 
fact 
that 
any 
restrictions 
of 
the 
freedom 
of 
the 
press, 
even 
in 
critical 
moments, 
are 
admissible 
only 
within 
the 
bound 
of 
necessity, 
the 
Council 
of 
People's 
Commissaries 
decrees 
as 
follows: 


General 
Rules 
on 
the 
Press. 


1. 
The 
following 
organs 
of 
the 
press 
shall 
be 
subject 
to 
be 
closed: 
(a) 
those 
inciting 
to 
open 
resistance 
or 
disobedience 
towards 
the 
Workers' 
and 
Peasants' 
Government; 
(b) 
those 
sowing 
confusion 
by 
means 
of 
an 
obviously 
calumniatory 
perversion 
of 
facts; 
(c) 
those 
inciting 
to 
acts 
of 
a 
criminal 
character 
punishable 
by 
the 
penal 
laws. 

2. 
The 
temporary 
or 
permanent 
closing 
of 
any 
organ 
of

shall 
be 
carried 
out 
only 
by 
a 
resolution 
of 
the 
Council 
of 
People's 
Commissaries. 
3. 
The 
present 
decree 
is 
of 
a 
temporary 
nature 
and 
will 
be 
revoked 
by 
special 
ukaz 
when 
the 
normal 
conditions 
of 
public 
life 
will 
be 
reestablished.

of 
working 
hours 
in 
a 
day 
is 
the 
time 
which, 
according 
to 
the 
agreement 
on 
employment 
(Articles 
48, 
60, 
96, 
98, 
103 
of 
the 
Industrial 
Labor 
Law), 
a 
workman 
is 
obliged 
to 
be 
in 
the

for 
the 
performance 
of 
work 
and 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
his 
manager. 
Note 
1: 
In 
underground 
work 
the 
time 
used 
to 
go 
down 
into

to 
the 
surface 
is 
counted 
as

determined 
by 
special 
agreement. 


2. 
The 
working 
time 
as 
determined 
by 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
internal 
organization 
of 
the 
enterprise 
(Clause 
1, 
Article 
103 
of 
the 
Industrial 
Labor 
Law) 
should 
not 
exceed 
eight 
working 
hours 
a 
day 
and 
forty-eight 
hours 
a 
week, 
including 
the 
time 
spent 
in 
cleaning 
the 
machinery 
and 
putting 
the 
establishment 
in 
a 
state 
of 
orderliness. 
On 
the 
day 
before 
Christmas 
(December 
24) 
and 
on 
Holy 
Trinity 
Day 
work 
stops 
at

3. 
After 
not 
more 
than 
six 
hours 
of 
work 
there 
should 
be 
a 
recess 
of 
not 
less 
than 
an 
hour 
for 
food 
and 
rest. 
Recesses 
are 
determined 
by 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
internal 
organization. 
During 
the 
recess 
the 
workman 
is 
free 
to 
dispose 
of 
his 
time 
and 
may 
leave 
the 
boundaries

may 
be 
permitted 
in 
case 
of 
overtime 
(as 
provided 
in 
Articles 
18-22 
of 
this 
law) 
in 
case 
of 
those 
machines 
and 
commutators 
that 
control 
ventilation, 
water 
supply, 
lighting, 
etc., 
and 
in 
such 
other 
cases 
where 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
stop 
work 
for 
technical 
reasons 
(as, 
for 
example, 
unfinished 
casting, 
etc.). 
Note 
1: 
Enterprises 
that 
are 
recognized 
by 
law 
or 
the 
Main 
Labor 
Office 
as 
continuous 
and 
on 
a 
three-shift 
day 
do 
not 
conform 
to 
the 
rules 
on 
recesses 
but 
they 
must 
give 
the 
workman 
the 
right 
to 
take 
his 
food 
during 
work. 


Note 
2: 
If 
the 
conditions 
of 
work 
are 
such 
that 
the 
workman 
cannot 
leave 
his 
place 
of 
work 
to 
eat, 
a 
special 
room 
or 
place 
is 
to 
be 
provided 
for 
that 
purpose. 
This 
is 
obligatory 
in 
case 
of 
men 
who 
come 
in 
contact 
with 
materials 
(lead, 
mercury, 
etc.) 
which, 
according 
to 
the 
rulings 
of 
the 
main 
board 
of 
the 
factory 
and 
mining 
industries 
(or 
the 
organ 
taking 
its 
place), 
are 
injurious 
to 
health. 


4. 
The 
total 
amount 
of 
time 
spent 
in 
recesses 
should 
not 
exceed 
two 
hours 

a

Resolution 
on 
the 
Right 
of 
Sovnarkom 
to 
Issue 
Decrees 


In 
reply 
to 
the 
questions 
raised 
the 
Central 
Executive 
Committee 
resolves 
that: 


1. 
The 
Soviet 
parliament 
of 
the 
toiling 
masses 
has 
nothing 
in 
common 
with 
the 
procedure 
of 
bourgeois 
parliaments 
where 
different 
classes 
and 
divergent 
interests 
meet 
and 
where 
the 
representatives 
of 
the 
ruling 
class 
use 
rules 
of 
procedure 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
parliamentary 
obstruction. 
2. 
The 
Soviet 
parliament 
cannot 
deny 
the 
Soviet 
of 
People's 
Commissars 
the 
right 
to 
issue 
decrees 
of 
immediate 
necessity 
in 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
general 
program 
of 
the 
All-Russian 
Congress 
of 
Soviets 
without 
first 
submitting 
them 
to 
the 
C.E.C.

The

has 
general 
control 
over

to 
recall 
the 
government 
or 
any 
member 
of 
it. 
4. 
The 
C.E.C. 
expresses 
its 
regret 
that 
the 
representatives 
of 
the 
Socialist-
Revolutionists 
of 
the 
Left 
whose 
members 
raised 
the 
question 
did 
not 
find 
it 
possible 
to 
associate 
themselves 
with 
the 
government 
in 
the 
drafting 
of 
all 
the 
decrees 
of 
immediate 
necessity. 

Decree 
on 
Social 
Insurance 


The 
Russian 
proletariat 
has 
placed 
on 
its 
banners 
“Full 
Social 
Insurance 
for 
Wage 
Workers” 
as 
well 
as 
for 
the 
city 
and 
village 
poor. 
The 
tsarist 
government 
of 
landowners 
and 
capitalists 
and 
the 
coalition-reconciliation 
governments[55] 
failed 
to 
satisfy 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
workers 
in 
this 
respect. 


The 
Workers' 
and 
Peasants' 
Government, 
being 
supported 
by 
the 
Soviet 
of 
Workers', 
Soldiers', 
and 
Peasants' 
Deputies, 
announces 
to 
the 
working 
class 
of 
Russia 
and 
to 
the 
city 
and 
village 
poor 
that 
it 
will 
immediately 
prepare 
decrees 
on 
social 
insurance 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 
workers. 


1. 
Insurance 
for 
all 
wage 
workers 
without 
exception, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
the 
city 
and 
village 
poor. 
2. 
Insurance 
to 
cover 
all 
forms 
of 
disability, 
such 
as 
illness, 
injury, 
invalidism, 
old 
age, 
maternity, 
widowhood, 
orphanage, 
as 
well 
as 
unemployment. 
3. 
The 
total 
cost 
of 
the 
insurance 
to 
be 
borne 
by 
the 
employer. 
4. 
Full 
compensation 
in 
case 
of 
disability 
or 
unemployment. 
5. 
The 
insured 
to 
have 
full 
control 
of 
the 
insurance 
institutions.[56] 
In 
the

Government

Russian 
Republic, 

Declaration 
of 
the 
Rights 
of 
the 
People 
of 
Russia 


The 
October 
revolution 
of 
the 
workmen 
and 
peasants 
began 
under 
the 
common 
banner 
of 
emancipation. 
The 
peasants 
are 
being 
emancipated 
from 
the 
power 
of 
the 
landowners, 
for 
there 
is 
no 
longer 
the 
landowner's 
property 
right 
in 
the 
land 
-it 
has 
been 
abolished. 
The 
soldiers 
and 
sailors 
are 
being 
emancipated 
from 
the 
power 
of 
autocratic 
generals, 
for 
generals 
will 
henceforth 
be 
elective 
and 
subject 
to 
recall. 
The 
workingmen 
are 
being 
emancipated 
from 
the 
whims 
and 
arbitrary 
will 
of 
the 
capitalists, 
for 
henceforth 
there 
will 
be 
established 
the 
control 
of 
the 
workers 
over 
mills 
and 
factories. 
Everything 
living 
and 
capable 
of 
life 
is 
being 
emancipated 
from 
the 
hateful 
shackles. 
There 
remain 
only 
the 
peoples 
of 
Russia, 
who 
have 
suffered 
and 
are 
suffering 
oppression 
and 
arbitrariness, 
and 
whose 
emancipation 
must 
immediately 
be 
begun, 
whose 
liberation 
must 
be 
effected 
resolutely 
and 
definitely. 


During 
the 
period 
of 
czarism 
the 
peoples 
of 
Russia 
were 
systematically 
incited 
against 
one 
another. 
The 
results 
of 
such 
a 
policy 
are 
known; 
massacres 
and 
pogroms 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
slavery 
of 
peoples 
on 
the 
other. 


There 
can 
be 
and 
there 
must 
be 
no 
return 
to 
this 
disgraceful 
policy 
of 
instigation. 
Henceforth 
the 
policy 
of 
a 
voluntary 
and 
honest 
union 
of 
the 
peoples 
of 
Russia 
must 
be 
substituted. 


In 
the 
period 
of 
imperialism; 
after 
the 
February 
revolution, 
when 
the 
power 
was 
transferred 
to 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
Cadet 
bourgeoisie, 
the 
naked 
policy 
of 
instigation 
gave 
way 
to 
one 
of 
cowardly 
distrust 
of 
the 
peoples 
of 
Russia, 
to 
a 
policy 
of 
fault-finding 
and 
provocation, 
of 
“freedom” 
and 
“equality” 
of 
peoples. 
The 
results 
of 
such 
a 
policy 
are 
known; 
the 
growth 
of 
national 
enmity, 
the 
impairment 
of 
mutual 
trust. 


An 
end 
must 
be 
put 
to 
this 
unworthy 
policy 
of 
falsehood 
and 
distrust, 
of 
fault-finding 
and 
provocation. 
Henceforth 
it 
must 
be 
replaced 
by 
an 
open 
and 
honest 
policy 
which 
leads 
to 
complete 
mutual 
trust 
of 
the 
people 
of 
Russia. 
Only 
as 
the 
result 
of 
such 
a 
trust 
can 
there 
be 
formed 
an 
honest 
and 
lasting 
union 
of 
the 
peoples 
of 
Russia. 
Only 
as 
the 
result 
of 
such 
a 
union 
can 
the 
workmen 
and 
peasants 
of 
the 
peoples 
of 
Russia 
be 
cemented 
into 
one 
revolutionary 
force 
able 
to 
resist 
all 
attempts 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
imperialistannexationist 
bourgeoisie. 


Starting 
with 
these 
assumptions, 
the 
first 
Congress 
of 
Soviets, 
in 
June 
of 



this 
year, 
proclaimed 
the 
right 
of 
the 
peoples 
of 
Russia 
to 
free 
self-
determination. 


The 
second 
Congress 
of 
Soviets, 
in 
October 
of 
this 
year, 
reaffirmed 
this 
inalienable 
right 
of 
the 
peoples 
of 
Russia 
more 
decisively 
and 
definitely. 


The 
united 
will 
of 
this 
Congresses, 
The 
Councils 
of 
the 
People's 
Commissars, 
resolved 
to 
base 
of 
their 
activity 
upon 
the 
question 
of 
the 
nationalties 
of 
Russia, 
as 
expressed 
in 
the 
following 
principles: 


1. 
The 
equality 
and 
sovereignty 
of 
the 
peoples 
of 
Russia. 
2. 
The 
right 
of 
the 
peoples 
of 
Russia 
to 
free 
self-determination, 
even 
to 
the 
point 
of 
separation 
and 
the 
formation 
of 
an 
independent 
state. 
3. 
The 
abolition 
of 
any 
and 
all 
national 
and 
national-religious 
privileges 
and 
disabilities. 
4. 
The 
free 
development 
of 
national 
minorities 
and 
ethnographic 
groups 
inhabiting 
the 
territory 
of 
Russia. 
The 
concrete 
decrees 
that 
follow 
from 
these 
principles 
will 
be 
immedieatly 
elaborated 
after 
the 
setting 
up 
of 
a 
Commission 
of 
Nationality 
Affairs. 


In 
the 
name 
of 
the 
Russian 
Republic, 



Decree 
on 
Organization 
of 
Volost 
Land

of 
Soviets 
of 
Workers', 
Soldiers', 
and 
Peasants' 
Deputies 
of 
July 
6, 
1917, 
shall 
be

such 
a 
time 
as 
the 
Constituent 
Assembly 
makes 
final 
rulings 
on 
all 
details 
of 
the 
land 
reform. 
2. 
The 
present 
law 
will 
become 
effective 
by 
telegraph. 
It 
is 
understood 
that 
the 
term 
volost 
refers 
to 
every 
territorial 
unit 
equal 
in 
size 
to 
that 
of 
a 
volost….. 
3. 
The 
formation 
of 
land 
committees 
in 
every 
volost 
is 
compulsory. 
In 
those 
places 
where 
the 
law 
of 
small 
zemstvo 
units 
is 
not 
yet 
in 
force, 
the 
land 
committees 
will 
be 
organized 
as 
self-governing 
bodies 
on 
the 
principle 
of 
direct, 
equal, 
and 
secret 
universal 
suffrage. 
In 
those 
places 
where 
the 
zemstvo 
units 
are 
already 
functioning…. 
the 
land 
committee 
will 
be 
organized 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
zemstvo….. 
4. 
Where 
volost 
zemstvos 
are 
not 
in 
existence 
the 
number 
of 
members 
of 
the 
land 
committee 
will 
be 
determined 
by 
the 
inhabitants 
themselves. 
Where 
zemstvos 
do 
exist 
the 
local 
population 
has 
the 
right 
to 
include 
in 
the 
land 
committee 
representatives 
from 
different 
villages, 
in 
addition 
to 
members 
provided

law….. 
5. 
All 
expenses 
in 
connection 
with 
the

and 
administration 
of 
the 
land 
committees 
will 
be 
borne

the 
state. 
6. 
Arbitration 
boards 
will 
be 
organized 
within 
the 
volost 
land 
committees 
to 
settle 
all 
disputed 
questions….. 
7. 
The 
volost 
land 
committees 
are 
charged 
with 
the 
rapid 
and 
definitive 
liquidation 
of 
all 
vestiges 
of 
serfdom 
preserved 
in 
the 
village. 
They 
must 
abolish 
all 
forms 
of 
bondage, 
such 
as 
menial 
service, 
payments 
in 
kind, 
etc. 
8. 
In 
order 
that 
there 
may 
be 
more 
rational 
management 
of 
the 
land 
fund, 
the 
land 
committee 
will 
collect 
all 
documentary 
data 
concerning 
the 
amount 
of 
land 
within 
the 
boundaries 
of 
the 
volost…. 
showing 
how 
much 
there 
is 
of 
each 
kind-meadow, 
forest, 
pasture, 
and 
arable 
land, 
etc. 
9. 
The 
volost 
land 
committee 
will

a 
survey 
of 
the 
forests 
within 
the 
boundaries 
of 
the 
volost 
and 
lay 
down, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
state 
forester, 
plans 
for 
felling. 

The

the 
area 
of 
land 
to

land 
reform 
within 
its

It 
will 
determine 
to 
what 
extent 
the 
available 
land 
fund 
is 
capable 
of 
satisfying 
local 
needs, 
what 
branches 
of 
agriculture 
stand 
in 
greatest 
need 
of 
additional 
land, 
what 
order 
is 
to 
be 
observed 
in 
distributing 
the 
land 
among 
those 
having 
little 
or 
no 
land, 
newcomers, 
etc. 
21. 
The

economy 
that 
are 
dictated 
by 
the 
necessities 
of 
the 
state 
and 
society 
as 
a 
whole 
(breeding

In 
the

the 
Russian 
Republic, 



Decree 
on 
Transfer 
of 
Power 
and 
the 
Means 
of 
Production 
to 
the 
Toilers 


Comrades-Workers, 
Soldiers, 
Peasants, 
All 
Toilers! 


The 
workers' 
and 
peasants' 
revolution 
has 
won 
a 
decisive 
victory 
in 
Petrograd, 
having 
scattered 
and 
arrested 
the 
last 
remnants 
of 
a 
small 
number 
of 
Cossacks 
deceived 
by 
Kerensky. 
The 
revolution 
has 
triumphed 
in 
Moscow…. 
the 
cadets 
and 
other 
Kornilov 
supporters 
have 
signed 
peace. 
They 
are 
now 
disarmed, 
and 
the 
Committee[58] 
has 
been 
dismissed. 
An 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
soldiers 
in 
the 
trenches 
and 
peasants 
in 
the 
villages 
are 
supporting 
the 
new 
government 
in 
its 
peace 
decree 
and 
its 
decree 
to 
hand 
over 
immediately 
the 
land 
to 
the 
peasants. 
The 
victory 
of 
the 
workers' 
and 
peasants' 
revolution 
is 
assured; 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
people 
are 
for 
it. 


It 
is 
easy 
to 
understand 
why 
the 
landowners, 
the 
capitalists, 
and 
the 
higher 
state 
officials 
who 
are 
closely 
bound 
up 
with 
the 
bourgeoisie-in 
one 
word, 
all 
the 
rich 
and 
those 
who 
held 
out 
their 
hands 
to 
the 
rich-should 
assume 
a 
hostile 
attitude 
toward 
the 
new 
revolution, 
should 
stand 
in 
its 
way, 
and 
should 
threaten 
to 
close 
the 
banks 
and 
to 
stop 
or 
to 
sabotage, 
directly 
or 
indirectly, 
the 
work 
of 
various 
institutions. 


Every 
class-conscious 
worker 
knows 
full 
well 
that 
this 
opposition 
is 
inevitable, 
that 
the 
higher 
officials 
were 
selected 
to 
oppress 
the 
people, 
and 
that 
they 
are 
not 
going 
to 
give 
up 
their 
place 
without 
a 
struggle. 
The 
laboring 
classes 
will 
not 
allow 
themselves 
to 
be 
frightened, 
even 
for 
a 
minute, 
by 
the 
threats 
and 
strikes 
of 
these 
partisans 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie. 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
people 
are 
with 
us. 
With 
us 
are 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
toilers, 
and 
the 
oppressed 
of 
the 
world. 
Right 
is 
on 
our 
side. 
Our 
victory 
is 
certain. 
The 
opposition 
of 
the 
capitalists 
and 
higher 
officials 
will 
be 
broken. 
We 
will 
not 
deprive 
a 
single 
person 
of 
his 
property 
otherwise 
than 
by 
a 
special 
government 
law 
concerning 
the 
nationalization 
of 
banks 
and 
trusts. 
This 
law 
is 
now 
in 
preparation. 
Not 
a 
single 
laborer 
and 
toiler 
will 
lose 
one 
kopek; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
he 
will 
be 
helped. 
The 
government 
will 
impose 
no 
new 
taxes 
now 
and 
will 
aim 
at 
an 
open 
and 
strict 
accounting 
and 
control 
over 
the 
taxes 
heretofore 
levied. 


In 
the 
name 
of 
these 
just 
demands 
the 
great 
majority 
of 
the 
people 
has 
rallied 
around 
the 
Provisional 
Workers' 
and 
Peasants' 
Government. 


Comrade 
Toilers! 
Remember 
that 
you 
yourself 
are 
now 
running 
the 



government. 
Unless 
you 
get 
together 
and 
take 
all 
affairs 
of 
the 
government 
into 
your 
own 
hands, 
no 
one 
will 
do 
it 
for 
you. 
Your 
Soviets 
are 
from 
now 
on 
all-powerful 
and 
all-decisive 
organs 
of 
government. 
Rally 
around 
your 
Soviets. 
Strengthen 
them. 
Take 
matters 
into 
your 
hands 
and 
don't 
wait 
for 
anyone.[59] 
Insist 
on 
the 
strictest 
revolutionary 
order. 
Crush 
mercilessly 
all 
anarchistic 
disturbances 
by 
drunkards, 
rowdies, 
counter-revolutionary 
cadets, 
Kornilovists, 
and 
their 
like. 


Organize 
strict 
control 
over 
production 
and 
accountability 
for 
the 
products. 
Bring 
before 
the 
revolutionary 
tribunal 
everyone 
who 
dares 
to 
harm 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
people 
by 
sabotaging 
(spoiling, 
hindering, 
destroying) 
in 
industry, 
concealing 
grain 
and 
produce, 
interfering 
with 
transportation 
of 
grain, 
tearing 
up 
rail, 
post, 
and 
telegraph 
lines, 
or 
in 
other 
ways 
opposing 
the 
great 
cause 
of 
peace, 
of 
transferring 
the 
land 
to 
the 
peasants, 
and 
of 
assuming 
workers' 
control 
over 
production 
and 
distribution. 


Comrade 
workers, 
soldiers, 
peasants, 
and 
all 
toilers! 
Take 
all 
local 
power 
into 
your 
own 
hands. 
Take 
and 
guard 
as 
the 
apple 
of 
your 
eye 
the 
grain, 
factories, 
implements, 
products, 
and 
transport-all 
these 
are 
from 
now 
on 
wholly 
yours; 
they 
are 
public 
property. 


Gradually, 
with 
the 
approval 
and 
agreement 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
peasants, 
guided 
by 
their 
practical 
experience 
and 
that 
of 
the 
workers, 
we 
shall 
move 
on 
firmly 
and 
resolutely 
to 
the 
victory 
of 
socialism, 
a 
victory 
which 
the 
advance 
guard 
of 
the 
workers 
of 
the 
more 
civilized 
countries 
will 
make 
secure 
and 
which 
is 
bound 
to 
give 
the 
people 
a 
lasting 
peace 
and 
freedom 
from 
all 
oppression 
and 
exploitation.

Decree 
on 
Workers' 
Control 


1. 
In 
the 
interests 
of 
a 
systematic 
regulation 
of 
national 
economy, 
Workers' 
Control 
is 
introduced 
in 
all 
industrial, 
commercial, 
agricultural[64] 
enterprises 
which 
are 
hiring 
people 
to 
work 
for 
them 
in 
their 
shops 
or 
which 
are 
giving 
them 
work 
to 
take 
home. 
This 
control 
is 
to 
extend 
over 
the 
production, 
storing, 
buying 
and 
selling 
of 
raw 
materials 
and 
finished 
products 
as 
well 
as 
over 
the 
finances 
of 
the 
enterprise. 


2. 
The 
workers 
will 
exercise 
this 
control 
through 
their 
elected 
organizations, 
such 
as 
factory 
and 
shop 
committees, 
Soviets 
of 
elders, 
etc. 
The 
office 
employees 
and 
the

personnel 
are 
also 
to 
have 
representation 
in 
these 
committees. 
3. 
Every 
large 
city, 
gubernia, 
and 
industrial 
area 
is 
to 
have 
its 
own 
Soviet 
of 
Workers' 
Control, 
which, 
being 
an 
organ 
of 
the 
S[65] 
of 
W,[66] 
S,[67] 
and 
P[68] 
D,[69] 
must 
be 
composed 
of 
representatives 
of 
trade-union, 
factory, 
shop 
and 
other 
workers' 
committees 
and 
workers' 
co-operatives. 


4. 
Until 
the 
meeting 
of 
the 
Congress 
of 
the 
Soviets 
of 
Workers' 
Control 
an 
All-Russian 
Soviet 
of 
Workers' 
Control 
will 
be

up 
of 
representatives 
from 
the 
following

5. 
Commissions 
of 
trained

(technicians, 
accountants, 
etc.) 
will 
be 
established 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
higher 
organs 
of 
Workers' 
Control 
and 
will 
be 
sent 
out 
either 
on 
the 
initiative 
of 
these 
higher 
organs 
or 
at 
the 
request 
of 
the 
lower 
organs 
of

Control 
to 
investigate 
the 
financial 
and 
technical 
side 
of 
enterprises.

and 
for 
past 
years. 


8.

of 
the 
organs 
of

Control 
are 
binding 
on 
the 
owners

raw 
materials 
or 
products, 
of 
falsifying

and 
of 
other 
similar 
abuses 
are 
criminally 
liable. 
11. 
All 
regional 
Soviets 
of 
Workers' 
Control 
(Article 
3) 
have 
the 
power 
to 
settle 
disputed 
points 
and 
conflicts 
that 
may 
arise 
between 
the 
lower 
organs 
of 
Workers' 
Control 
and 
to 
give 
their 
decision 
regarding 
the 
complaints 
of 
the 
owners. 
They 
also 
issue 
instructions 
(within 
the 
limits 
fixed 
by 
the 
All-
Russian 
Soviet

Workers' 
Control) 
to

conditions 
of 
production 
and 
supervise 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
lower 
organs 
of 
control. 
12.

co-ordinates 
the 
activities 
of 
the

of 
Workers' 
Control 
in 
their

with 
other

Note 
To 
F. 
E. 
Dzerzhinsky 
with 
a 
Draft 
of 
A 
Decree 
On 
Fighting 
Counter-Revolutionaries 
And 
Saboteurs[78] 


To 
Comrade 
Dzerzhinsky, 


Further 
to 
your 
report 
today 
on 
measures 
for 
fighting 
saboteurs 
and 
counter-revolutionaries, 


would 
it 
not 
be 
possible 
to 
submit 
a 
decree 
like 
the 
following? 


On 
Fighting 
Counter-Revolutionaries 
and 
Saboteurs 


The 
bourgeoisie, 
the 
landowners 
and 
all 
the 
rich 
classes 
are 
making 
desperate 
efforts 
to 
undermine 
the 
revolution, 
the 
aim 
of 
which 
is 
to 
safeguard 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
workers, 
the 
working 
and 
exploited 
masses. 


The 
bourgeoisie 
are 
prepared 
to 
commit 
the 
most 
heinous 
crimes; 
they 
are 
bribing 
the 
outcast 
and 
degraded 
elements 
of 
society 
and 
plying 
them 
with 
drink 
to 
use 
them 
in 
riots. 
The 
supporters 
of 
the 
bourgeoisie, 
particularly 
among 
the 
higher 
clerical 
staff, 
bank 
officials, 
and 
so 
on, 
are 
sabotaging 
their 
work, 
and 
are 
organising 
strikes 
to 
thwart 
the 
government's 
measures 
for 
the 
realisation 
of 
socialist 
reforms. 
They 
have 
even 
gone 
so 
far 
as 
to 
sabotage 
food 
distribution, 
thereby 
menacing 
millions 
of 
people 
with 
famine. 


Urgent 
measures 
are 
necessary 
to 
fight 
the 
counter-revolutionaries 
and 
saboteurs. 
In 
virtue 
of 
this, 
the 
Council 
of 
People's 
Commissars 
decrees: 


(1) 
Persons 
belonging 
to 
the 
wealthy 
classes 
(i.e., 
with 
incomes 
of 
500 
rubles 
or 
more 
per 
month, 
and 
owners 
of 
urban 
real 
estate, 
stocks 
and 
shares, 
or 
money 
amounting 
to 
over 
1,000 
rubles), 
and 
also 
all 
employees 
of 
banks, 
joint-stock 
companies, 
state 
and 
public 
institutions, 
shall 
within 
three 
days[79] 
present 
to 
their 
house 
committees 
written 
statements 
in 
three 
copies 
over 
their 
own 
signatures 
and 
indicating 
their 
address, 
income, 
place 
of 
employment 
and 
their 
occupation. 
(2) 
The 
house 
committees 
shall 
countersign 
these 
statements, 
retain 
one 
copy 
and 
send 
one 
copy 
to 
the 
municipality 
and 
another 
to 
the 
People's 
Commissariat 
for 
Internal 
Affairs 
(address:…[80]). 
(3) 
Persons 
guilty 
of 
contravening 
the 
present 
law 
(failing 
to 
submit 
statements, 
giving 
false 
information, 
etc.) 
and 
members 
of 
house 
committees 
infringing 
the 
regulations 
governing 
the 
collection, 
filing 
and 
presentation 
of 

these 
statements 
to 
the 
institutions 
mentioned 
above 
shall 
be 
liable 
to 
a 
fine 
of 
up 
to 
5,000 
rubles 
for 
each 
infringement, 
or 
to 
imprisonment 
up 
to 
one 
year, 
or 
shall 
be 
sent 
to 
the 
front, 
depending 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
offence. 


(4) 
Persons 
sabotaging 
the 
work 
of, 
or 
declining 
to 
work 
in, 
banks, 
state 
and 
public 
institutions, 
joint-stock 
companies, 
railways, 
etc., 
shall 
be 
liable 
to 
similar 
punishment. 
(5) 
As 
a 
first 
step 
towards 
universal 
labour 
conscription, 
it 
is 
decreed 
that 
the 
persons 
referred 
to 
in 
§ 
I 
shall 
be 
obliged, 
first, 
constantly 
to 
carry 
with 
them 
a

of 
the 
above-mentioned 
statement 
certified 
by 
the 
house 
committees 
and 
by 
their 
chiefs 
or 
elected 
officials 
(factory 
committees, 
food 
committees, 
railway 
committees, 
employees' 
trade 
unions, 
etc.); 
the 
certificates 
must 
indicate 
what 
public 
service 
or 
work 
is 
being 
performed 
by 
the 
individual 
in 
question, 
or 
whether 
he 
is 
living 
with 
his 
family 
as 
a 
disabled 
member 
thereof, 
etc. 
(6) 
Secondly, 
such 
persons 
shall 
be 
obliged 
to 
acquire, 
within 
one 
week 
from 
the 
promulgation 
of 
the 
present 
law, 
worker-consumer 
books 
(specimen 
attached), 
in 
which 
their 
weekly 
income 
and 
expenditures 
shall 
be 
entered, 
together 
with 
the 
public 
duties 
performed 
by 
the 
individual 
in 
question, 
certified 
by 
the 
proper 
committees 
or 
institutions. 
(7) 
Persons 
who 
do 
not 
come 
under 
§ 
l 
shall 
present 
to 
their 
house 
committees 
a 
statement 
in 
one 
copy 
of 
their 
income 
and 
place 
of 
employment 
and 
shall

The 
Dreamer 
In 
The 
Kremlin 



My 
chief 
purpose 
in 
going 
from 
Petersburg 
to 
Moscow 
was 
to 
see 
and 
talk 
to 
Lenin. 
I 
was 
very 
curious 
to 
see 
him, 
and 
I 
was 
disposed 
to 
be 
hostile 
to 
him. 
I 
encountered 
a 
personality 
entirely 
different 
from 
anything 
I 
had 
expected 
to 
meet. 


Lenin 
is 
not 
a 
writer; 
his 
published 
work 
does 
not 
express 
him. 
The 
shrill 
little 
pamphlets 
and 
papers 
issued 
from 
Moscow 
in 
his 
name, 
full 
of 
misconceptions 
of 
the 
labour 
psychology 
of 
the 
West 
and 
obstinately 
defensive 
of 
the 
impossible 
proposition 
that 
it 
is 
the 
prophesied 
Marxist 
social 
revolution 
which 
has 
happened 
in 
Russia, 
display 
hardly 
anything 
of 
the 
real 
Lenin 
mentality 
as 
I 
encountered 
it. 
Occasionally 
there 
are 
gleams 
of 
an 
inspired 
shrewdness, 
but 
for 
the 
rest 
these 
publications 
do 
no 
more 
than 
rehearse 
the 
set 
ideas 
and 
phrases 
of 
doctrinaire 
Marxism. 
Perhaps 
that 
is 
necessary. 
That 
may 
be 
the 
only 
language 
Communism 
understands; 
a 
break 
into 
a 
new 
dialect 
would 
be 
disturbing 
and 
demoralising. 
Left 
Communism 
is 
the 
backbone 
of 
Russia 
to-day; 
unhappily 
it 
is 
a 
backbone 
without 
flexible 
joints, 
a 
backbone 
that 
can 
be 
bent 
only 
with 
the 
utmost 
difficulty 
and 
which 
must 
be 
bent 
by 
means 
of 
flattery 
and 
deference. 


Moscow 
under 
the 
bright 
October 
sunshine, 
amidst 
the 
fluttering 
yellow 
leaves, 
impressed 
us 
as 
being 
altogether 
more 
lax 
and 
animated 
than 
Petersburg. 
There 
is 
much 
more 
movement 
of 
people, 
more 
trading, 
and 
a 
comparative 
plenty 
of 
droshkys. 
Markets 
are 
open. 
There 
is 
not 
the 
same 
general 
ruination 
of 
streets 
and 
houses. 
There 
are, 
it 
is 
true, 
many 
traces 
of 
the 
desperate 
street 
fighting 
of 
early 
1918. 
One 
of 
the 
domes 
of 
that 
absurd 
cathedral 
of 
St. 
Basil 
just 
outside 
the 
Kremlin 
gate 
was 
smashed 
by 
a 
shell 
and 
still 
awaits 
repair. 
The 
tramcars 
we 
found 
were 
not 
carrying 
passengers; 
they 
were 
being 
used 
for 
the 
transport 
of 
supplies 
of 
food 
and 
fuel. 
In 
these 
matters 
Petersburg 
claims 
to 
be 
better 
prepared 
than 
Moscow. 


The 
ten 
thousand 
crosses 
of 
Moscow 
still 
glitter 
in 
the 
afternoon 
light. 
On 
one 
conspicuous 
pinnacle 
of 
the 
Kremlin 
the 
imperial 
eagles 
spread 
their 
wings; 
the 
Bolshevik 
Government 
has 
been 
too 
busy 
or 
too 
indifferent 
to 
pull 
them 
down. 
The 
churches 
are 
open, 
the 
kissing 
of 
ikons 
is 
a 
flourishing 
industry, 
and 
beggars 
still 
woo 
casual 
charity 
at 
the 
doors. 
The 
celebrated 
miraculous 
shrine 
of 
the 
Iberian 
Madonna 
outside 
the 
Redeemer 
Gate 
was 
particularly 
busy. 
There 
were 
many 
peasant 
women, 
unable 
to 
get 
into 
the 
little 
chapel, 
kissing 
the 
stones 
outside. 


Just 
opposite 
to 
it, 
on 
a 
plaster 
panel 
on 
a 
house 
front, 
is 
that 
now 
celebrated 
inscription 
put 
up 
by 
one 
of 
the 
early 
revolutionary 



administrations 
in 
Moscow: 
“Religion 
is 
the 
Opium 
of 
the 
People.” 
The 
effect 
this 
inscription 
produces 
is 
greatly 
reduced 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
Russia 
the 
people 
cannot 
read. 


About 
that 
inscription 
I 
had 
a 
slight 
but 
amusing 
argument 
with 
Mr. 
Vanderlip, 
the 
American 
financier, 
who 
was 
lodged 
in 
the 
same 
guest 
house 
as 
ourselves. 
He 
wanted 
to 
have 
it 
effaced. 
I 
was 
for 
retaining 
it 
as 
being 
historically 
interesting, 
and 
because 
I 
think 
that 
religious 
toleration 
should 
extend 
to 
atheists. 
But 
Mr. 
Vanderlip 
felt 
too 
strongly 
to 
see 
the 
point 
of 
that. 


The 
Moscow 
Guest 
House, 
which 
we 
shared 
with 
Mr. 
Vanderlip 
and 
an 
adventurous 
English 
artist 
who 
had 
somehow 
got 
through 
to 
Moscow 
to 
execute 
busts 
of 
Lenin 
and 
Trotsky, 
was 
a 
big, 
richly-furnished 
house 
upon 
the 
Sofiskaya 
Naberezhnaya 
(No. 
17), 
directly 
facing 
the 
great 
wall 
of 
the 
Kremlin 
and 
all 
the 
clustering 
domes 
and 
pinnacles 
of 
that 
imperial 
inner 
city. 
We 
felt 
much 
less 
free 
and 
more 
secluded 
here 
than 
in 
Petersburg. 
There 
were 
sentinels 
at 
the 
gates 
to 
protect 
us 
from 
casual 
visitors, 
whereas 
in 
Petersburg 
all 
sorts 
of 
unauthorised 
persons 
could 
and 
did 
stray 
in 
to 
talk 
to 
me. 
Mr. 
Vanderlip 
had 
been 
staying 
here, 
I 
gathered, 
for 
some 
weeks, 
and 
proposed 
to 
stay 
some 
weeks 
more. 
He 
was 
without 
valet, 
secretary, 
or 
interpreter. 
He 
did 
not 
discuss 
his 
business 
with 
me 
beyond 
telling 
me 
rather 
carefully 
once 
or 
twice 
that 
it 
was 
strictly 
financial 
and 
commercial 
and 
in 
no 
sense 
political. 
I 
was 
told 
that 
he 
had 
brought 
credentials 
from 
Senator 
Harding 
to 
Lenin, 
but 
I 
am 
temperamentally 
incurious 
and 
I 
made 
no 
attempt 
whatever 
to 
verify 
this 
statement 
or 
to 
pry 
into 
Mr. 
Vanderlip’s 
affairs. 
I 
did 
not 
even 
ask 
how 
it 
could 
be 
possible 
to 
conduct 
business 
or 
financial 
operations 
in 
a 
Communist 
State 
with 
anyone 
but 
the 
Government, 
nor 
how 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
deal 
with 
a 
Government 
upon 
strictly 
nonpolitical 
lines. 
These 
were, 
I 
admitted, 
mysteries 
beyond 
my 
understanding. 
But 
we 
ate, 
smoked, 
drank 
our 
coffee 
and 
conversed 
together 
in 
an 
atmosphere 
of 
profound 
discretion. 
By 
not 
mentioning 
Mr. 
Vanderlip’s 
“mission,” 
we 
made 
it 
a 
portentous, 
omnipresent 
fact. 


The 
arrangements 
leading 
up 
to 
my 
meeting 
with 
Lenin 
were 
tedious 
and 
irritating, 
but 
at 
last 
I 
found 
myself 
under 
way 
for 
the 
Kremlin 
in 
the 
company 
of 
Mr. 
Rothstein, 
formerly 
a 
figure 
in 
London 
Communist 
circles, 
and 
an 
American 
comrade 
with 
a 
large 
camera 
who 
was 
also, 
I 
gathered, 
an 
official 
of 
the 
Russian 
Foreign 
Office. 


The 
Kremlin 
as 
I 
remembered 
it 
in 
1914 
was 
a 
very 
open 
place, 
open 
much 
as 
Windsor 
Castle 
is, 
with 
a 
thin 
trickle 
of 
pilgrims 
and 
tourists 
in 



groups 
and 
couples 
flowing 
through 
it. 
But 
now 
it 
is 
closed 
up 
and 
difficult 
of 
access. 
There 
was 
a 
great 
pother 
with 
passes 
and 
permits 
before 
we 
could 
get 
through 
even 
the 
outer 
gates. 
And 
we 
filtered 
and 
inspected 
through 
five 
or 
six 
rooms 
of 
clerks 
and 
sentinels 
before 
we 
got 
into 
the 
presence. 
This 
may 
be 
necessary 
for 
the 
personal 
security 
of 
Lenin, 
but 
it 
puts 
him 
out 
of 
reach 
of 
Russia, 
and, 
what 
perhaps 
is 
more 
serious, 
if 
there 
is 
to 
be 
an 
effectual 
dictatorship, 
it 
puts 
Russia 
out 
of 
his 
reach. 
If 
things 
must 
filter 
up 
to 
him, 
they 
must 
also 
filter 
down, 
and 
they 
may 
undergo 
very 
considerable 
changes 
in 
the 
process. 


We 
got 
to 
Lenin 
at 
last 
and 
found 
him, 
a 
little 
figure 
at 
a 
great 
desk 
in 
a 
well-lit 
room 
that 
looked 
out 
upon 
palatial 
spaces. 
I 
thought 
his 
desk 
was 
rather 
in 
a 
litter. 
I 
sat 
down 
on 
a 
chair 
at 
a 
corner 
of 
the 
desk, 
and 
the 
little 
man-his 
feet 
scarcely 
touch 
the 
ground 
as 
he 
sits 
on 
the 
edge 
of 
his 
chair-
twisted 
round 
to 
talk 
to 
me, 
putting 
his 
arms 
round 
and 
over 
a 
pile 
of 
papers. 
He 
spoke 
excellent 
English, 
but 
it 
was, 
I 
thought, 
rather 
characteristic 
of 
the 
present 
condition 
of 
Russian 
affairs 
that 
Mr. 
Rothstein 
chaperoned 
the 
conversation, 
occasionally 
offering 
footnotes 
and 
other 
assistance. 
Meanwhile 
the 
American 
got 
to 
work 
with 
his 
camera, 
and 
unobtrusively 
but 
persistently 
exposed 
plates. 
The 
talk, 
however, 
was 
too 
interesting 
for 
that 
to 
be 
an 
annoyance. 
One 
forgot 
about 
that 
clicking 
and 
shifting 
about 
quite 
soon. 


I 
had 
come 
expecting 
to 
struggle 
with 
a 
doctrinaire 
Marxist. 
I 
found 
nothing 
of 
the 
sort. 
I 
had 
been 
told 
that 
Lenin 
lectured 
people; 
he 
certainly 
did 
not 
do 
so 
on 
this 
occasion. 
Much 
has 
been 
made 
of 
his 
laugh 
in 
the 
descriptions, 
a 
laugh 
which 
is 
said 
to 
be 
pleasing 
at 
first 
and 
afterwards 
to 
become 
cynical. 
This 
laugh 
was 
not 
in 
evidence. 
His 
forehead 
reminded 
me 
of 
someone 
else-I 
could 
not 
remember 
who 
it 
was, 
until 
the 
other 
evening 
I 
saw 
Mr. 
Arthur 
Balfour 
sitting 
and 
talking 
under 
a 
shaded 
light. 
It 
is 
exactly 
the 
same 
domed, 
slightly 
one-sided 
cranium. 
Lenin 
has 
a 
pleasant, 
quick-
changing, 
brownish 
face, 
with 
a 
lively 
smile 
and 
a 
habit 
(due 
perhaps 
to 
some 
defect 
in 
focussing) 
of 
screwing 
up 
one 
eye 
as 
he 
pauses 
in 
his 
talk; 
he 
is 
not 
very 
like 
the 
photographs 
you 
see 
of 
him 
because 
he 
is 
one 
of 
those 
people 
whose 
change 
of 
expression 
is 
more 
important 
than 
their 
features; 
he 
gesticulated 
a 
little 
with 
his 
hands 
over 
the 
heaped 
papers 
as 
he 
talked, 
and 
he 
talked 
quickly, 
very 
keen 
on 
his 
subject, 
without 
any 
posing 
or 
pretences 
or 
reservations, 
as 
a 
good 
type 
of 
scientific 
man 
will 
talk. 


Our 
talk 
was 
threaded 
throughout 
and 
held 
together 
by 
two-what 
shall 
I 



call 
them?-motifs. 
One 
was 
from 
me 
to 
him: 
“What 
do 
you 
think 
you 
are 
making 
of 
Russia? 
What 
is 
the 
state 
you 
are 
trying 
to 
create?” 
The 
other 
was 
from 
him 
to 
me: 
‘Why 
does 
not 
the 
social 
revolution 
begin 
in 
England? 
Why 
do 
you 
not 
work 
for 
the 
social 
revolution? 
Why 
are 
you 
not 
destroying 
Capitalism 
and 
establishing 
the 
Communist 
State?” 
These 
motifs 
interwove, 
reacted 
on 
each 
other, 
illuminated 
each 
other. 
The 
second 
brought 
back 
the 
first: 
“But 
what 
are 
you 
making 
of 
the 
social 
revolution? 
Are 
you 
making 
a 
success 
of 
it?” 
And 
from 
that 
we 
got 
back 
to 
two 
again 
with: 
“To 
make 
it 
a 
success 
the 
Western 
world 
must 
join 
in. 
Why 
doesn’t 
it?” 


In 
the 
days 
before 
1918 
all 
the 
Marxist 
world 
thought 
of 
the 
social 
revolution 
as 
an 
end. 
The 
workers 
of 
the 
world 
were 
to 
unite, 
overthrow 
Capitalism, 
and 
be 
happy 
ever 
afterwards. 
But 
in 
1918 
the 
Communists, 
to 
their 
own 
surprise, 
found 
themselves 
in 
control 
of 
Russia 
and 
challenged 
to 
produce 
their 
millennium. 
They 
have 
a 
colourable 
excuse 
for 
a 
delay 
in 
the 
production 
of 
a 
new 
and 
better 
social 
order 
in 
their 
continuation 
of 
war 
conditions, 
in 
the 
blockade 
and 
so 
forth, 
nevertheless 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
they 
begin 
to 
realise 
the 
tremendous 
unpreparedness 
which 
the 
Marxist 
methods 
of 
thought 
involve. 
A 
hundred 
points-I 
have 
already 
put 
a 
finger 
upon 
one 
or 
two 
of 
them-they 
do 
not 
know 
what 
to 
do. 
But 
the 
commonplace 
Communist 
simply 
loses 
his 
temper 
if 
you 
venture 
to 
doubt 
whether 
everything 
is 
being 
done 
in 
precisely 
the 
best 
and 
most 
intelligent 
way 
under 
the 
new 
régime. 
He 
is 
like 
a 
tetchy 
housewife 
who 
wants 
you 
to 
recognise 
that 
everything 
is 
in 
perfect 
order 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
an 
eviction. 
He 
is 
like 
one 
of 
those 
now 
forgotten 
suffragettes 
who 
used 
to 
promise 
us 
an 
earthly 
paradise 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
escaped 
from 
the 
tyranny 
of 
“man-made 
laws.” 
Lenin, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
whose 
frankness 
must 
at 
times 
leave 
his 
disciples 
breathless, 
has 
recently 
stripped 
off 
the 
last 
pretence 
that 
the 
Russian 
revolution 
is 
anything 
more 
than 
the 
inauguration 
of 
an 
age 
of 
limitless 
experiment. 
“Those 
who 
are 
engaged 
in 
the 
formidable 
task 
of 
overcoming 
capitalism,” 
he 
has 
recently 
written, 
“must 
be 
prepared 
to 
try 
method 
after 
method 
until 
they 
find 
the 
one 
which 
answers 
their 
purpose 
best.” 


We 
opened 
our 
talk 
with 
a 
discussion 
of 
the 
future 
of 
the 
great 
towns 
under 
Communism. 
I 
wanted 
to 
see 
how 
far 
Lenin 
contemplated 
the 
dying 
out 
of 
the 
towns 
in 
Russia. 
The 
desolation 
of 
Petersburg 
had 
brought 
home 
to 
me 
a 
point 
I 
had 
never 
realised 
before, 
that 
the 
whole 
form 
and 
arrangement 
of 
a 
town 
is 
determined 
by 
shopping 
and 
marketing, 
and 
that 
the 
abolition 
of 
these 
things 
renders 
nine-tenths 
of 
the 
buildings 
in 
an 
ordinary 
town 
directly 



or 
indirectly 
unmeaning 
and 
useless. 
“The 
towns 
will 
get 
very 
much 
smaller,” 
he 
admitted. 
“They 
will 
be 
different. 
Yes, 
quite 
different.” 
That, 
I 
suggested, 
implied 
a 
tremendous 
task. 
It 
meant 
the 
scrapping 
of 
the 
existing 
towns 
and 
their 
replacement. 
The 
churches 
and 
great 
buildings 
of 
Petersburg 
would 
become 
presently 
like 
those 
of 
Novgorod 
the 
Great 
or 
like 
the 
temples 
of 
Paestum. 
Most 
of 
the 
town 
would 
dissolve 
away. 
He 
agreed 
quite 
cheerfully. 
I 
think 
it 
warmed 
his 
heart 
to 
find 
someone 
who 
understood 
a 
necessary 
consequence 
of 
collectivism 
that 
many 
even 
of 
his 
own 
people 
fail 
to 
grasp. 
Russia 
has 
to 
be 
rebuilt 
fundamentally, 
has 
to 
become 
a 
new 
thing… 


And 
industry 
has 
to 
be 
reconstructed-as 
fundamentally? 


Did 
I 
realise 
what 
was 
already 
in 
hand 
with 
Russia? 
The 
electrification 
of 
Russia? 


For 
Lenin, 
who 
like 
a 
good 
orthodox 
Marxist 
denounces 
all 
“Utopians,” 
has 
succumbed 
at 
last 
to 
a 
Utopia, 
the 
Utopia 
of 
the 
electricians. 
He 
is 
throwing 
all 
his 
weight 
into 
a 
scheme 
for 
the 
development 
of 
great 
power 
stations 
in 
Russia 
to 
serve 
whole 
provinces 
with 
light, 
with 
transport, 
and 
industrial 
power. 
Two 
experimental 
districts 
he 
said 
had 
already 
been 
electrified. 
Can 
one 
imagine 
a 
more 
courageous 
project 
in 
a 
vast 
flat 
land 
of 
forests 
and 
illiterate 
peasants, 
with 
no 
water 
power, 
with 
no 
technical 
skill 
available, 
and 
with 
trade 
and 
industry 
at 
the 
last 
gasp? 
Projects 
for 
such 
an 
electrification 
are 
in 
process 
of 
development 
in 
Holland 
and 
they 
have 
been 
discussed 
in 
England, 
and 
in 
those 
densely-populated 
and 
industrially 
highly-
developed 
centres 
one 
can 
imagine 
them 
as 
successful, 
economical, 
and 
altogether 
beneficial. 
But 
their 
application 
to 
Russia 
is 
an 
altogether 
greater 
strain 
upon 
the 
constructive 
imagination. 
I 
cannot 
see 
anything 
of 
the 
sort 
happening 
in 
this 
dark 
crystal 
of 
Russia, 
but 
this 
little 
man 
at 
the 
Kremlin 
can; 
he 
sees 
the 
decaying 
railways 
replaced 
by 
a 
new 
electric 
transport, 
sees 
new 
roadways 
spreading 
throughout 
the 
land, 
sees 
a 
new 
and 
happier 
Communist 
industrialism 
arising 
again. 
While 
I 
talked 
to 
him 
he 
almost 
persuaded 
me 
to 
share 
his 
vision. 


“And 
you 
will 
go 
on 
to 
these 
things 
with 
the 
peasants 
rooted 
in 
your 
soil?” 


But 
not 
only 
are 
the 
towns 
to 
be 
rebuilt; 
every 
agricultural 
landmark 
is 
to 
go. 


“Even 
now,” 
said 
Lenin, 
“all 
the 
agricultural 
production 
of 
Russia 
is 
not 
peasant 
production. 
We 
have, 
in 
places, 
large 
scale 
agriculture. 
The 
Government 
is 
already 
running 
big 
estates 
with 
workers 
instead 
of 
peasants, 



where 
conditions 
are 
favourable. 
That 
can 
spread. 
It 
can 
be 
extended 
first 
to 
one 
province, 
then 
another. 
The 
peasants 
in 
the 
other 
provinces, 
selfish 
and 
illiterate, 
will 
not 
know 
what 
is 
happening 
until 
their 
turn 
comes…” 


It 
may 
be 
difficult 
to 
defeat 
the 
Russian 
peasant 
en 
masse; 
but 
in 
detail 
there 
is 
no 
difficulty 
at 
all. 
At 
the 
mention 
of 
the 
peasant 
Lenin’s 
head 
came 
nearer 
to 
mine; 
his 
manner 
became 
confidential. 
As 
if 
after 
all 
the 
peasant 
might 
overhear. 


It 
is 
not 
only 
the 
material 
organisation 
of 
society 
you 
have 
to 
build, 
I 
argued, 
it 
is 
the 
mentality 
of 
a 
whole 
people. 
The 
Russian 
people 
are 
by 
habit 
and 
tradition 
traders 
and 
individualists; 
their 
very 
souls 
must 
be 
remoulded 
if 
this 
new 
world 
is 
to 
be 
achieved. 
Lenin 
asked 
me 
what 
I 
had 
seen 
of 
the 
educational 
work 
afoot. 
I 
praised 
some 
of 
the 
things 
I 
had 
seen. 
He 
nodded 
and 
smiled 
with 
pleasure. 
He 
has 
an 
unshaken 
confidence 
in 
his 
work. 


“But 
these 
are 
only 
sketches 
and 
beginnings,” 
I 
said. 


“Come 
back 
and 
see 
what 
we 
have 
done 
in 
Russia 
in 
ten 
years’ 
time,” 
he 
answered. 


In 
him 
I 
realised 
that 
Communism 
could 
after 
all, 
in 
spite 
of 
Marx, 
be 
enormously 
creative. 
After 
the 
tiresome 
class-war 
fanatics 
I 
had 
been 
encountering 
among 
the 
Communists, 
men 
of 
formulæ 
as 
sterile 
as 
flints, 
after 
numerous 
experiences 
of 
the 
trained 
and 
empty 
conceit 
of 
the 
common 
Marxist 
devotee, 
this 
amazing 
little 
man, 
with 
his 
frank 
admission 
of 
the 
immensity 
and 
complication 
of 
the 
project 
of 
Communism 
and 
his 
simple 
concentration 
upon 
its 
realisation, 
was 
very 
refreshing. 
He 
at 
least 
has 
a 
vision 
of 
a 
world 
changed 
over 
and 
planned 
and 
built 
afresh. 


He 
wanted 
more 
of 
my 
Russian 
impressions. 
I 
told 
him 
that 
I 
thought 
that 
in 
many 
directions, 
and 
more 
particularly 
in 
the 
Petersburg 
Commune, 
Communism 
was 
pressing 
too 
hard 
and 
too 
fast, 
and 
destroying 
before 
it 
was 
ready 
to 
rebuild. 
They 
had 
broken 
down 
trading 
before 
they 
were 
ready 
to 
ration; 
the 
co-operative 
organisation 
had 
been 
smashed 
up 
instead 
of 
being 
utilised, 
and 
so 
on. 
That 
brought 
us 
to 
our 
essential 
difference, 
the 
difference 
of 
the 
Collectivist 
and 
Marxist, 
the 
question 
whether 
the 
social 
revolution 
is, 
in 
its 
extremity, 
necessary, 
whether 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
overthrow 
one 
social 
and 
economic 
system 
completely 
before 
the 
new 
one 
can 
begin. 
I 
believe 
that 
through 
a 
vast 
sustained 
educational 
campaign 
the 
existing 
Capitalist 
system 
could 
be 
civilised 
into 
a 
Collectivist 
world 
system; 
Lenin 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
tied 
himself 
years 
ago 
to 
the 
Marxist 
dogmas 
of 
the 
inevitable 
class 
war, 
the 
downfall 
of 
Capitalist 
order 
as 
a 
prelude 
to 
reconstruction, 
the 
proletarian 



dictatorship, 
and 
so 
forth. 
He 
had 
to 
argue, 
therefore, 
that 
modern 
Capitalism 
is 
incurably 
predatory, 
wasteful, 
and 
unteachable, 
and 
that 
until 
it 
is 
destroyed 
it 
will 
continue 
to 
exploit 
the 
human 
heritage 
stupidly 
and 
aimlessly, 
that 
it 
will 
fight 
against 
and 
prevent 
any 
administration 
of 
national 
resources 
for 
the 
general 
good, 
and 
that 
it 
will 
inevitably 
make 
wars. 


I 
had, 
I 
will 
confess, 
a 
very 
uphill 
argument. 
He 
suddenly 
produced 
Chiozza 
Money’s 
new 
book, 
The 
Triumph 
of 
Nationalisation, 
which 
he 
had 
evidently 
been 
reading 
very 
carefully. 
“But 
you 
see 
directly 
you 
begin 
to 
have 
a 
good 
working 
collectivist 
organisation 
of 
any 
public 
interest, 
the 
Capitalists 
smash 
it 
up 
again. 
They 
smashed 
your 
national 
shipyards; 
they 
won’t 
let 
you 
work 
your 
coal 
economically.” 
He 
tapped 
the 
book. 
“It 
is 
all 
here.” 


And 
against 
my 
argument 
that 
wars 
sprang 
from 
nationalist 
imperialism 
and 
not 
from 
a 
Capitalist 
organisation 
of 
society 
he 
suddenly 
brought: 
“But 
what 
do 
you 
think 
of 
this 
new 
Republican 
Imperialism 
that 
comes 
to 
us 
from 
America?” 


Here 
Mr. 
Rothstein 
intervened 
in 
Russian 
with 
an 
objection 
that 
Lenin 
swept 
aside. 


And 
regardless 
of 
Mr. 
Rothstein’s 
plea 
for 
diplomatic 
reserve, 
Lenin 
proceeded 
to 
explain 
the 
projects 
with 
which 
one 
American 
at 
least 
was 
seeking 
to 
dazzle 
the 
imagination 
of 
Moscow. 
There 
was 
to 
be 
economic 
assistance 
for 
Russia 
and 
recognition 
of 
the 
Bolshevik 
Government. 
There 
was 
to 
be 
a 
defensive 
alliance 
against 
Japanese 
aggression 
in 
Siberia. 
There 
was 
to 
be 
an 
American 
naval 
station 
on 
the 
coast 
of 
Asia, 
and 
leases 
for 
long 
terms 
of 
sixty 
or 
fifty 
years 
of 
the 
natural 
resources 
of 
Khamchatka 
and 
possibly 
of 
other 
large 
regions 
of 
Russian 
Asia. 
Well, 
did 
I 
think 
that 
made 
for 
peace? 
Was 
it 
anything 
more 
than 
the 
beginning 
of 
a 
new 
world 
scramble? 
How 
would 
the 
British 
Imperialists 
like 
this 
sort 
of 
thing? 


But 
some 
industrial 
power 
had 
to 
come 
in 
and 
help 
Russia, 
I 
said. 
She 
cannot 
reconstruct 
now 
without 
such 
help… 


Our 
multifarious 
argumentation 
ended 
indecisively. 
We 
parted 
warmly, 
and 
I 
and 
my 
companion 
were 
filtered 
out 
of 
the 
Kremlin 
through 
one 
barrier 
after 
another 
in 
much 
the 
same 
fashion 
as 
we 
had 
been 
filtered 
in. 


“He 
is 
wonderful,” 
said 
Mr. 
Rothstein. 
“But 
it 
was 
an 
indiscretion-” 


I 
was 
not 
disposed 
to 
talk 
as 
we 
made 
our 
way, 
under 
the 
glowing 
trees 
that 
grow 
in 
the 
ancient 
moat 
of 
the 
Kremlin, 
back 
to 
our 
Guest 
House. 
I 
wanted 
to 
think 
Lenin 
over 
while 
I 
had 
him 
fresh 
in 
my 
mind, 
and 
I 
did 
not 



want 
to 
be 
assisted 
by 
the 
expositions 
of 
my 
companion. 
But 
Mr. 
Rothstein 
kept 
on 
talking. 


He 
was 
still 
pressing 
me 
not 
to 
mention 
this 
little 
sketch 
of 
the 
Russian 
American 
outlook 
to 
Mr. 
Vanderlip 
long 
after 
I 
assured 
him 
that 
I 
respected 
Mr. 
Vanderlip’s 
veil 
of 
discretion 
far 
too 
much 
to 
pierce 
it 
by 
any 
careless 
word. 


And 
so 
back 
to 
No. 
17 
Sofiskaya 
Naberezhnaya, 
and 
lunch 
with 
Mr. 
Vanderlip 
and 
the 
young 
sculptor 
from 
London. 
The 
old 
servant 
of 
the 
house 
waited 
on 
us, 
mournfully 
conscious 
of 
the 
meagreness 
of 
our 
entertainment 
and 
reminiscent 
of 
the 
great 
days 
of 
the 
past 
when 
Caruso 
had 
been 
a 
guest 
and 
had 
sung 
to 
all 
that 
was 
brilliant 
in 
Moscow 
in 
the 
room 
upstairs. 
Mr. 
Vanderlip 
was 
for 
visiting 
the 
big 
market 
that 
afternoon-and 
later 
going 
to 
the 
Ballet, 
but 
my 
son 
and 
I 
were 
set 
upon 
returning 
to 
Petersburg 
that 
night 
and 
so 
getting 
on 
to 
Reval 
in 
time 
for 
the 
Stockholm 
boat.

Lenin

“Great

Lenin's 
mocking 
name 
of 
nationalist-chauvinist 
Russians 
who 
sought

“Great

Lenin 
raised 
the 
question 
of 
fighting 
the 
internal 
counter-revolution 
and 
sabotage 
before 
the 
Council 
of 
People’s 
Commissars 
on 
December 
6 
(19), 
1917, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
fierce 
resistance 
to 
the 
measures 
of 
the 
Soviet 
Government 
and 
a 
possible 
strike 
by 
senior 
civil 
servants. 
Dzerzhinsky 
was 
asked 
to 
form 
a 
commission 
to 
inquire 
into 
ways 
of 
fighting 
the 
sabotage. 
On 
December 
7 
(20), 
the 
government 
heard 
his 
report, 
in 
connection 
with 
which 
Lenin 
appears 
to 
have 
written 
his 
draft 
decree. 
At 
the 
same 
sitting 
the 
government 
formed 
the 
All-Russia 
Extraordinary 
Commission 
(Cheka) 
to 
Combat 
Counter-Revolution 
and 
Sabotage. 
Dzerzinisky 
was 
appointed 
its 
chairman.
