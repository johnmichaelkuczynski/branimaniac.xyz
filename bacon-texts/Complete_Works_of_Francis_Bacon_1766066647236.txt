Proem 


Francis 
of 
Verulam 
reasoned 
thus 
with 
himself 
and 
judged 
it 
to 
be 
for 
the 
interest 
of 
the 
present 
and 
future 
generations 
that 
they 
should 
be 
made 
acquainted 
with 
his 
thoughts. 


Being 
convinced 
that 
the 
human 
intellect 
makes 
its 
own 
difficulties, 
not 
using 
the 
true 
helps 
which 
are 
at 
man's 
disposal 
soberly 
and 
judiciously 
â 
€” 
whence 
follows 
manifold 
ignorance 
of 
things, 
and 
by 
reason 
of 
that 
ignorance 
mischiefs 
innumerable 
â€” 
he 
thought 
all 
trial 
should 
be 
made, 
whether 
that 
commerce 
between 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
which 
is 
more 
precious 
than 
anything 
on 
earth, 
or 
at 
least 
than 
anything 
that 
is 
of 
the 
earth, 
might 
by 
any 
means 
be 
restored 
to 
its 
perfect 
and 
original 
condition, 
or 
if 
that 
may 
not 
be, 
yet 
reduced 
to 
a 
better 
condition 
than 
that 
in 
which 
it 
now 
is. 
Now 
that 
the 
errors 
which 
have 
hitherto 
prevailed, 
and 
which 
will 
prevail 
for 
ever, 
should 
(if 
the 
mind 
be 
left 
to 
go 
its 
own 
way) 
either 
by 
the 
natural 
force 
of 
the 
understanding 
or 
by 
help 
of 
the 
aids 
and 
instruments 
of 
logic, 
one 
by 
one, 
correct 
themselves, 
was 
a 
thing 
not 
to 
be 
hoped 
for, 
because 
the 
primary 
notions 
of 
things 
which 
the 
mind 
readily 
and 
passively 
imbibes, 
stores 
up, 
and 
accumulates 
(and 
it 
is 
from 
them 
that 
all 
the 
rest 
flow) 
are 
false, 
confused, 
and 
overhastily 
abstracted 
from 
the 
facts; 
nor 
are 
the 
secondary 
and 
subsequent 
notions 
less 
arbitrary 
and 
inconstant; 
whence 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
entire 
fabric 
of 
human 
reason 
which 
we 
employ 
in 
the 
inquisition 
of 
nature 
is 
badly 
put 
together 
and 
built 
up, 
and 
like 
some 
magnificent 
structure 
without 
any 
foundation. 
For 
while 
men 
are 
occupied 
in 
admiring 
and 
applauding 
the 
false 
powers 
of 
the 
mind, 
they 
pass 
by 
and 
throw 
away 
those 
true 
powers, 
which, 
if 
it 
be 
supplied 
with 
the 
proper 
aids 
and 
can 
itself 
be 
content 
to 
wait 
upon 
nature 
instead 
of 
vainly 
affecting 
to 
overrule 
her, 
are 
within 
its 
reach. 
There 
was 
but 
one 
course 
left, 
therefore 
â€” 
to 
try 
the 
whole 
thing 
anew 
upon 
a 
better 
plan, 
and 
to 
commence 
a 
total 
reconstruction 
of 
sciences, 
arts, 
and 
all 
human 
knowledge, 
raised 
upon 
the 
proper 
foundations. 
And 
this, 
though 
in 
the 
project 
and 
undertaking 
it 
may 
seem 
a 
thing 
infinite 
and 
beyond 
all 
the 
powers 
of 
man, 
yet 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
be 
dealt 
with 
it 
will 
be 
found 
sound 
and 
sober, 
more 
so 
than 
what 
has 
been 



done 
hitherto. 
For 
of 
this 
there 
is 
some 
issue; 
whereas 
in 
what 
is 
now 
done 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
science 
there 
is 
only 
a 
whirling 
round 
about, 
and 
perpetual 
agitation, 
ending 
where 
it 
began. 
And 
although 
he 
was 
well 
aware 
how 
solitary 
an 
enterprise 
it 
is, 
and 
how 
hard 
a 
thing 
to 
win 
faith 
and 
credit 
for, 
nevertheless 
he 
was 
resolved 
not 
to 
abandon 
either 
it 
or 
himself, 
nor 
to 
be 
deterred 
from 
trying 
and 
entering 
upon 
that 
one 
path 
which 
is 
alone 
open 
to 
the 
human 
mind. 
For 
better 
it 
is 
to 
make 
a 
beginning 
of 
that 
which 
may 
lead 
to 
something, 
than 
to 
engage 
in 
a 
perpetual 
struggle 
and 
pursuit 
in 
courses 
which 
have 
no 
exit. 
And 
certainly 
the 
two 
ways 
of 
contemplation 
are 
much 
like 
those 
two 
ways 
of 
action, 
so 
much 
celebrated, 
in 
this 
â€” 
that 
the 
one, 
arduous 
and 
difficult 
in 
the 
beginning, 
leads 
out 
at 
last 
into 
the 
open 
country, 
while 
the 
other, 
seeming 
at 
first 
sight 
easy 
and 
free 
from 
obstruction, 
leads 
to 
pathless 
and 
precipitous 
places. 


Moreover, 
because 
he 
knew 
not 
how 
long 
it 
might 
be 
before 
these 
things 
would 
occur 
to 
anyone 
else, 
judging 
especially 
from 
this, 
that 
he 
has 
found 
no 
man 
hitherto 
who 
has 
applied 
his 
mind 
to 
the 
like, 
he 
resolved 
to 
publish 
at 
once 
so 
much 
as 
he 
has 
been 
able 
to 
complete. 
The 
cause 
of 
which 
haste 
was 
not 
ambition 
for 
himself, 
but 
solicitude 
for 
the 
work; 
that 
in 
case 
of 
his 
death 
there 
might 
remain 
some 
outline 
and 
project 
of 
that 
which 
he 
had 
conceived, 
and 
some 
evidence 
likewise 
of 
his 
honest 
mind 
and 
inclination 
toward 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
human 
race. 
Certain 
it 
is 
that 
all 
other 
ambition 
whatsoever 
seemed 
poor 
in 
his 
eyes 
compared 
with 
the 
work 
which 
he 
had 
in 
hand, 
seeing 
that 
the 
matter 
at 
issue 
is 
either 
nothing 
or 
a 
thing 
so 
great 
that 
it 
may 
well 
be 
content 
with 
its 
own 
merit, 
without 
seeking 
other 
recompense. 



Epistle 
Dedicatory 


TO 
OUR 
MOST 
GRACIOUS 
AND 
MIGHTY 
PRINCE 
AND 
LORD 


JAMES, 


BY 
THE 
GRACE 
OF 
GOD 
OF 
GREAT 
BRITAIN, 
FRANCE, 
AND 
IRELAND 
KING, 
DEFENDER 
OF 
THE 
FAITH, 
ETC. 


Most 
Gracious 
and 
Mighty 
King, 


Your 
Majesty 
may 
perhaps 
accuse 
me 
of 
larceny, 
having 
stolen 
from 
your 
affairs 
so 
much 
time 
as 
was 
required 
for 
this 
work. 
I 
know 
not 
what 
to 
say 
for 
myself. 
For 
of 
time 
there 
can 
be 
no 
restitution 
unless 
it 
be 
that 
what 
has 
been 
abstracted 
from 
your 
business 
may 
perhaps 
go 
to 
the 
memory 
of 
your 
name 
and 
the 
honor 
of 
your 
age; 
if 
these 
things 
are 
indeed 
worth 
anything. 
Certainly 
they 
are 
quite 
new, 
totally 
new 
in 
their 
very 
kind: 
and 
yet 
they 
are 
copied 
from 
a 
very 
ancient 
model, 
even 
the 
world 
itself 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
and 
of 
the 
mind. 
And 
to 
say 
truth, 
I 
am 
wont 
for 
my 
own 
part 
to 
regard 
this 
work 
as 
a 
child 
of 
time 
rather 
than 
of 
wit, 
the 
only 
wonder 
being 
that 
the 
first 
notion 
of 
the 
thing, 
and 
such 
great 
suspicions 
concerning 
matters 
long 
established, 
should 
have 
come 
into 
any 
man's 
mind. 
All 
the 
rest 
follows 
readily 
enough. 
And 
no 
doubt 
there 
is 
something 
of 
accident 
(as 
we 
call 
it) 
and 
luck 
as 
well 
in 
what 
men 
think 
as 
in 
what 
they 
do 
or 
say. 
But 
for 
this 
accident 
which 
I 
speak 
of, 
I 
wish 
that 
if 
there 
be 
any 
good 
in 
what 
I 
have 
to 
offer, 
it 
may 
be 
ascribed 
to 
the 
infinite 
mercy 
and 
goodness 
of 
God, 
and 
to 
the 
felicity 
of 
your 
Majesty's 
times; 
to 
which 
as 
I 
have 
been 
an 
honest 
and 
affectionate 
servant 
in 
my 
life, 
so 
after 
my 
death 
I 
may 
yet 
perhaps, 
through 
the 
kindling 
of 
this 
new 
light 
in 
the 
darkness 
of 
philosophy, 
be 
the 
means 
of 
making 
this 
age 
famous 
to 
posterity; 
and 
surely 
to 
the 
times 
of 
the 
wisest 
and 
most 
learned 
of 
kings 
belongs 
of 
right 
the 
regeneration 
and 
restoration 
of 
the 
sciences. 
Lastly, 
I 
have 
a 
request 
to 
make 
â€” 
a 
request 
no 
way 
unworthy 
of 



your 
Majesty, 
and 
which 
especially 
concerns 
the 
work 
in 
hand, 
namely, 
that 
you 
who 
resemble 
Solomon 
in 
so 
many 
things 
â€” 
in 
the 
gravity 
of 
your 
judgments, 
in 
the 
peacefulness 
of 
your 
reign, 
in 
the 
largeness 
of 
your 
heart, 
in 
the 
noble 
variety 
of 
the 
books 
which 
you 
have 
composed 
â€” 
would 
further 
follow 
his 
example 
in 
taking 
order 
for 
the 
collecting 
and 
perfecting 
of 
a 
natural 
and 
experimental 
history, 
true 
and 
severe 
(unincumbered 
with 
literature 
and 
book-learning), 
such 
as 
philosophy 
may 
be 
built 
upon 
â€” 
such, 
in 
fact, 
as 
I 
shall 
in 
its 
proper 
place 
describe: 
that 
so 
at 
length, 
after 
the 
lapse 
of 
so 
many 
ages, 
philosophy 
and 
the 
sciences 
may 
no 
longer 
float 
in 
air, 
but 
rest 
on 
the 
solid 
foundation 
of 
experience 
of 
every 
kind, 
and 
the 
same 
well 
examined 
and 
weighed. 
I 
have 
provided 
the 
machine, 
but 
the 
stuff 
must 
be 
gathered 
from 
the 
facts 
of 
nature. 
May 
God 
Almighty 
long 
preserve 
your 
Majesty! 


Your 
Majesty's 
Most 
bounden 
and 
devoted 
Servant, 


FRANCIS 
VERULAM, 
Chancellor. 



Preface 


That 
the 
state 
of 
knowledge 
is 
not 
prosperous 
nor 
greatly 
advancing, 
and 
that 
a 
way 
must 
be 
opened 
for 
the 
human 
understanding 
entirely 
different 
from 
any 
hitherto 
known, 
and 
other 
helps 
provided, 
in 
order 
that 
the 
mind 
may 
exercise 
over 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
the 
authority 
which 
properly 
belongs 
to 
it. 


It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
men 
do 
not 
rightly 
understand 
either 
their 
store 
or 
their 
strength, 
but 
overrate 
the 
one 
and 
underrate 
the 
other. 
Hence 
it 
follows 
that 
either 
from 
an 
extravagant 
estimate 
of 
the 
value 
of 
the 
arts 
which 
they 
possess 
they 
seek 
no 
further, 
or 
else 
from 
too 
mean 
an 
estimate 
of 
their 
own 
powers 
they 
spend 
their 
strength 
in 
small 
matters 
and 
never 
put 
it 
fairly 
to 
the 
trial 
in 
those 
which 
go 
to 
the 
main. 
These 
are 
as 
the 
pillars 
of 
fate 
set 
in 
the 
path 
of 
knowledge, 
for 
men 
have 
neither 
desire 
nor 
hope 
to 
encourage 
them 
to 
penetrate 
further. 
And 
since 
opinion 
of 
store 
is 
one 
of 
the 
chief 
causes 
of 
want, 
and 
satisfaction 
with 
the 
present 
induces 
neglect 
of 
provision 
for 
the 
future, 
it 
becomes 
a 
thing 
not 
only 
useful, 
but 
absolutely 
necessary, 
that 
the 
excess 
of 
honor 
and 
admiration 
with 
which 
our 
existing 
stock 
of 
inventions 
is 
regarded 
be 
in 
the 
very 
entrance 
and 
threshold 
of 
the 
work, 
and 
that 
frankly 
and 
without 
circumlocution 
stripped 
off, 
and 
men 
be 
duly 
warned 
not 
to 
exaggerate 
or 
make 
too 
much 
of 
them. 
For 
let 
a 
man 
look 
carefully 
into 
all 
that 
variety 
of 
books 
with 
which 
the 
arts 
and 
sciences 
abound, 
he 
will 
find 
everywhere 
endless 
repetitions 
of 
the 
same 
thing, 
varying 
in 
the 
method 
of 
treatment, 
but 
not 
new 
in 
substance, 
insomuch 
that 
the 
whole 
stock, 
numerous 
as 
it 
appears 
at 
first 
view, 
proves 
on 
examination 
to 
be 
but 
scanty. 
And 
for 
its 
value 
and 
utility 
it 
must 
be 
plainly 
avowed 
that 
that 
wisdom 
which 
we 
have 
derived 
principally 
from 
the 
Greeks 
is 
but 
like 
the 
boyhood 
of 
knowledge, 
and 
has 
the 
characteristic 
property 
of 
boys: 
it 
can 
talk, 
but 
it 
cannot 
generate, 
for 
it 
is 
fruitful 
of 
controversies 
but 
barren 
of 
works. 
So 
that 
the 
state 
of 
learning 
as 
it 
now 
is 
appears 
to 
be 
represented 
to 
the 
life 
in 
the 
old 
fable 
of 
Scylla, 
who 
had 
the 
head 
and 
face 
of 
a 
virgin, 
but 
her 
womb 
was 
hung 
round 
with 
barking 
monsters, 
from 
which 
she 
could 
not 
be 
delivered. 
For 
in 
like 
manner 
the 
sciences 
to 
which 
we 
are 
accustomed 
have 
certain 
general 
positions 
which 
are 
specious 
and 
flattering; 
but 
as 
soon 
as 
they 
come 



to 
particulars, 
which 
are 
as 
the 
parts 
of 
generation, 
when 
they 
should 
produce 
fruit 
and 
works, 
then 
arise 
contentions 
and 
barking 
disputations, 
which 
are 
the 
end 
of 
the 
matter 
and 
all 
the 
issue 
they 
can 
yield. 
Observe 
also, 
that 
if 
sciences 
of 
this 
kind 
had 
any 
life 
in 
them, 
that 
could 
never 
have 
come 
to 
pass 
which 
has 
been 
the 
case 
now 
for 
many 
ages 
â€” 
that 
they 
stand 
almost 
at 
a 
stay, 
without 
receiving 
any 
augmentations 
worthy 
of 
the 
human 
race, 
insomuch 
that 
many 
times 
not 
only 
what 
was 
asserted 
once 
is 
asserted 
still, 
but 
what 
was 
a 
question 
once 
is 
a 
question 
still, 
and 
instead 
of 
being 
resolved 
by 
discussion 
is 
only 
fixed 
and 
fed; 
and 
all 
the 
tradition 
and 
succession 
of 
schools 
is 
still 
a 
succession 
of 
masters 
and 
scholars, 
not 
of 
inventors 
and 
those 
who 
bring 
to 
further 
perfection 
the 
things 
invented. 
In 
the 
mechanical 
arts 
we 
do 
not 
find 
it 
so; 
they, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
as 
having 
in 
them 
some 
breath 
of 
life, 
are 
continually 
growing 
and 
becoming 
more 
perfect. 
As 
originally 
invented 
they 
are 
commonly 
rude, 
clumsy, 
and 
shapeless; 
afterwards 
they 
acquire 
new 
powers 
and 
more 
commodious 
arrangements 
and 
constructions, 
in 
so 
far 
that 
men 
shall 
sooner 
leave 
the 
study 
and 
pursuit 
of 
them 
and 
turn 
to 
something 
else 
than 
they 
arrive 
at 
the 
ultimate 
perfection 
of 
which 
they 
are 
capable. 
Philosophy 
and 
the 
intellectual 
sciences, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
stand 
like 
statues, 
worshipped 
and 
celebrated, 
but 
not 
moved 
or 
advanced. 
Nay, 
they 
sometimes 
flourish 
most 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
first 
author, 
and 
afterwards 
degenerate. 
For 
when 
men 
have 
once 
made 
over 
their 
judgments 
to 
others' 
keeping, 
and 
(like 
those 
senators 
whom 
they 
called 
Pedarii) 
have 
agreed 
to 
support 
some 
one 
person's 
opinion, 
from 
that 
time 
they 
make 
no 
enlargement 
of 
the 
sciences 
themselves, 
but 
fall 
to 
the 
servile 
office 
of 
embellishing 
certain 
individual 
authors 
and 
increasing 
their 
retinue. 
And 
let 
it 
not 
be 
said 
that 
the 
sciences 
have 
been 
growing 
gradually 
till 
they 
have 
at 
last 
reached 
their 
full 
stature, 
and 
so 
(their 
course 
being 
completed) 
have 
settled 
in 
the 
works 
of 
a 
few 
writers; 
and 
that 
there 
being 
now 
no 
room 
for 
the 
invention 
of 
better, 
all 
that 
remains 
is 
to 
embellish 
and 
cultivate 
those 
things 
which 
have 
been 
invented 
already. 
Would 
it 
were 
so! 
But 
the 
truth 
is 
that 
this 
appropriating 
of 
the 
sciences 
has 
its 
origin 
in 
nothing 
better 
than 
the 
confidence 
of 
a 
few 
persons 
and 
the 
sloth 
and 
indolence 
of 
the 
rest. 
For 
after 
the 
sciences 
had 
been 
in 
several 
perhaps 
cultivated 
and 
handled 
diligently, 
there 
has 
risen 
up 
some 
man 
of 
bold 
disposition, 
and 
famous 
for 
methods 
and 
short 
ways 
which 
people 
like, 
who 
has 
in 
appearance 
reduced 
them 
to 
an 
art, 
while 
he 
has 
in 
fact 
only 
spoiled 
all 
that 
the 
others 
had 
done.1 
And 
yet 
this 
is 
what 
posterity 
likes, 
because 
it 
makes 
the 
work 
short 
and 
easy, 
and 
saves 



further 
inquiry, 
of 
which 
they 
are 
weary 
and 
impatient. 
And 
if 
any 
one 
take 
this 
general 
acquiescence 
and 
consent 
for 
an 
argument 
of 
weight, 
as 
being 
the 
judgment 
of 
Time, 
let 
me 
tell 
him 
that 
the 
reasoning 
on 
which 
he 
relies 
is 
most 
fallacious 
and 
weak. 
For, 
first, 
we 
are 
far 
from 
knowing 
all 
that 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
sciences 
and 
arts 
has 
in 
various 
ages 
and 
places 
been 
brought 
to 
light 
and 
published, 
much 
less 
all 
that 
has 
been 
by 
private 
persons 
secretly 
attempted 
and 
stirred; 
so 
neither 
the 
births 
nor 
the 
miscarriages 
of 
Time 
are 
entered 
in 
our 
records. 
Nor, 
secondly, 
is 
the 
consent 
itself 
and 
the 
time 
it 
has 
continued 
a 
consideration 
of 
much 
worth. 
For 
however 
various 
are 
the 
forms 
of 
civil 
polities, 
there 
is 
but 
one 
form 
of 
polity 
in 
the 
sciences; 
and 
that 
always 
has 
been 
and 
always 
will 
be 
popular. 
Now 
the 
doctrines 
which 
find 
most 
favor 
with 
the 
populace 
are 
those 
which 
are 
either 
contentious 
and 
pugnacious, 
or 
specious 
and 
empty 
â€” 
such, 
I 
say, 
as 
either 
entangle 
assent 
or 
tickle 
it. 
And 
therefore 
no 
doubt 
the 
greatest 
wits 
in 
each 
successive 
age 
have 
been 
forced 
out 
of 
their 
own 
course: 
men 
of 
capacity 
and 
intellect 
above 
the 
vulgar 
having 
been 
fain, 
for 
reputation's 
sake, 
to 
bow 
to 
the 
judgment 
of 
the 
time 
and 
the 
multitude; 
and 
thus 
if 
any 
contemplations 
of 
a 
higher 
order 
took 
light 
anywhere, 
they 
were 
presently 
blown 
out 
by 
the 
winds 
of 
vulgar 
opinions. 
So 
that 
Time 
is 
like 
a 
river 
which 
has 
brought 
down 
to 
us 
things 
light 
and 
puffed 
up, 
while 
those 
which 
are 
weighty 
and 
solid 
have 
sunk. 
Nay, 
those 
very 
authors 
who 
have 
usurped 
a 
kind 
of 
dictatorship 
in 
the 
sciences 
and 
taken 
upon 
them 
to 
lay 
down 
the 
law 
with 
such 
confidence, 
yet 
when 
from 
time 
to 
time 
they 
come 
to 
themselves 
again, 
they 
fall 
to 
complaints 
of 
the 
subtlety 
of 
nature, 
the 
hiding 
places 
of 
truth, 
the 
obscurity 
of 
things, 
the 
entanglement 
of 
causes, 
the 
weakness 
of 
the 
human 
mind; 
wherein 
nevertheless 
they 
show 
themselves 
never 
the 
more 
modest, 
seeing 
that 
they 
will 
rather 
lay 
the 
blame 
upon 
the 
common 
condition 
of 
men 
and 
nature 
than 
upon 
themselves. 
And 
then 
whatever 
any 
art 
fails 
to 
attain, 
they 
ever 
set 
it 
down 
upon 
the 
authority 
of 
that 
art 
itself 
as 
impossible 
of 
attainment; 
and 
how 
can 
art 
be 
found 
guilty 
when 
it 
is 
judge 
in 
its 
own 
cause? 
So 
it 
is 
but 
a 
device 
for 
exempting 
ignorance 
from 
ignominy. 
Now 
for 
those 
things 
which 
are 
delivered 
and 
received, 
this 
is 
their 
condition: 
barren 
of 
works, 
full 
of 
questions; 
in 
point 
of 
enlargement 
slow 
and 
languid, 
carrying 
a 
show 
of 
perfection 
in 
the 
whole, 
but 
in 
the 
parts 
ill 
filled 
up; 
in 
selection 
popular, 
and 
unsatisfactory 
even 
to 
those 
who 
propound 
them; 
and 
therefore 
fenced 
round 
and 
set 
forth 
with 
sundry 
artifices. 
And 
if 
there 
be 
any 
who 
have 
determined 
to 
make 
trial 
for 
themselves 
and 
put 
their 
own 
strength 
to 
the 
work 
of 



advancing 
the 
boundaries 
of 
the 
sciences, 
yet 
have 
they 
not 
ventured 
to 
cast 
themselves 
completely 
loose 
from 
received 
opinions 
or 
to 
seek 
their 
knowledge 
at 
the 
fountain; 
but 
they 
think 
they 
have 
done 
some 
great 
thing 
if 
they 
do 
but 
add 
and 
introduce 
into 
the 
existing 
sum 
of 
science 
something 
of 
their 
own, 
prudently 
considering 
with 
themselves 
that 
by 
making 
the 
addition 
they 
can 
assert 
their 
liberty, 
while 
they 
retain 
the 
credit 
of 
modesty 
by 
assenting 
to 
the 
rest. 
But 
these 
mediocrities 
and 
middle 
ways 
so 
much 
praised, 
in 
deferring 
to 
opinions 
and 
customs, 
turn 
to 
the 
great 
detriment 
of 
the 
sciences. 
For 
it 
is 
hardly 
possible 
at 
once 
to 
admire 
an 
author 
and 
to 
go 
beyond 
him, 
knowledge 
being 
as 
water, 
which 
will 
not 
rise 
above 
the 
level 
from 
which 
it 
fell. 
Men 
of 
this 
kind, 
therefore, 
amend 
some 
things, 
but 
advance 
little, 
and 
improve 
the 
condition 
of 
knowledge, 
but 
do 
not 
extend 
its 
range. 
Some, 
indeed, 
there 
have 
been 
who 
have 
gone 
more 
boldly 
to 
work 
and, 
taking 
it 
all 
for 
an 
open 
matter 
and 
giving 
their 
genius 
full 
play, 
have 
made 
a 
passage 
for 
themselves 
and 
their 
own 
opinions 
by 
pulling 
down 
and 
demolishing 
former 
ones; 
and 
yet 
all 
their 
stir 
has 
but 
little 
advanced 
the 
matter, 
since 
their 
aim 
has 
been 
not 
to 
extend 
philosophy 
and 
the 
arts 
in 
substance 
and 
value, 
but 
only 
to 
change 
doctrines 
and 
transfer 
the 
kingdom 
of 
opinions 
to 
themselves; 
whereby 
little 
has 
indeed 
been 
gained, 
for 
though 
the 
error 
be 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
other, 
the 
causes 
of 
erring 
are 
the 
same 
in 
both. 
And 
if 
there 
have 
been 
any 
who, 
not 
binding 
themselves 
either 
to 
other 
men's 
opinions 
or 
to 
their 
own, 
but 
loving 
liberty, 
have 
desired 
to 
engage 
others 
along 
with 
themselves 
in 
search, 
these, 
though 
honest 
in 
intention, 
have 
been 
weak 
in 
endeavor. 
For 
they 
have 
been 
content 
to 
follow 
probable 
reasons 
and 
are 
carried 
round 
in 
a 
whirl 
of 
arguments, 
and 
in 
the 
promiscuous 
liberty 
of 
search 
have 
relaxed 
the 
severity 
of 
inquiry. 
There 
is 
none 
who 
has 
dwelt 
upon 
experience 
and 
the 
facts 
of 
nature 
as 
long 
as 
is 
necessary. 
Some 
there 
are 
indeed 
who 
have 
committed 
themselves 
to 
the 
waves 
of 
experience 
and 
almost 
turned 
mechanics, 
yet 
these 
again 
have 
in 
their 
very 
experiments 
pursued 
a 
kind 
of 
wandering 
inquiry, 
without 
any 
regular 
system 
of 
operations. 
And 
besides 
they 
have 
mostly 
proposed 
to 
themselves 
certain 
petty 
tasks, 
taking 
it 
for 
a 
great 
matter 
to 
work 
out 
some 
single 
discovery 
â€” 
a 
course 
of 
proceeding 
at 
once 
poor 
in 
aim 
and 
unskillful 
in 
design. 
For 
no 
man 
can 
rightly 
and 
successfully 
investigate 
the 
nature 
of 
anything 
in 
the 
thing 
itself; 
let 
him 
vary 
his 
experiments 
as 
laboriously 
as 
he 
will, 
he 
never 
comes 
to 
a 
resting-place, 
but 
still 
finds 
something 
to 
seek 
beyond. 
And 
there 
is 
another 
thing 
to 
be 
remembered 
â€” 
namely, 
that 
all 
industry 
in 



experimenting 
has 
begun 
with 
proposing 
to 
itself 
certain 
definite 
works 
to 
be 
accomplished, 
and 
has 
pursued 
them 
with 
premature 
and 
unseasonable 
eagerness; 
it 
has 
sought, 
I 
say, 
experiments 
of 
fruit, 
not 
experiments 
of 
light, 
not 
imitating 
the 
divine 
procedure, 
which 
in 
its 
first 
day's 
work 
created 
light 
only 
and 
assigned 
to 
it 
one 
entire 
day, 
on 
which 
day 
it 
produced 
no 
material 
work, 
but 
proceeded 
to 
that 
on 
the 
days 
following. 
As 
for 
those 
who 
have 
given 
the 
first 
place 
to 
logic, 
supposing 
that 
the 
surest 
helps 
to 
the 
sciences 
were 
to 
be 
found 
in 
that, 
they 
have 
indeed 
most 
truly 
and 
excellently 
perceived 
that 
the 
human 
intellect 
left 
to 
its 
own 
course 
is 
not 
to 
be 
trusted; 
but 
then 
the 
remedy 
is 
altogether 
too 
weak 
for 
the 
disease, 
nor 
is 
it 
without 
evil 
in 
itself. 
For 
the 
logic 
which 
is 
received, 
though 
it 
be 
very 
properly 
applied 
to 
civil 
business 
and 
to 
those 
arts 
which 
rest 
in 
discourse 
and 
opinion, 
is 
not 
nearly 
subtle 
enough 
to 
deal 
with 
nature; 
and 
in 
attempting 
what 
it 
cannot 
master, 
has 
done 
more 
to 
establish 
and 
perpetuate 
error 
than 
to 
open 
the 
way 
to 
truth. 


Upon 
the 
whole, 
therefore, 
it 
seems 
that 
men 
have 
not 
been 
happy 
hitherto 
either 
in 
the 
trust 
which 
they 
have 
placed 
in 
others 
or 
in 
their 
own 
industry 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
sciences; 
especially 
as 
neither 
the 
demonstrations 
nor 
the 
experiments 
as 
yet 
known 
are 
much 
to 
be 
relied 
upon. 
But 
the 
universe 
to 
the 
eye 
of 
the 
human 
understanding 
is 
framed 
like 
a 
labyrinth, 
presenting 
as 
it 
does 
on 
every 
side 
so 
many 
ambiguities 
of 
way, 
such 
deceitful 
resemblances 
of 
objects 
and 
signs, 
natures 
so 
irregular 
in 
their 
lines 
and 
so 
knotted 
and 
entangled. 
And 
then 
the 
way 
is 
still 
to 
be 
made 
by 
the 
uncertain 
light 
of 
the 
sense, 
sometimes 
shining 
out, 
sometimes 
clouded 
over, 
through 
the 
woods 
of 
experience 
and 
particulars; 
while 
those 
who 
offer 
themselves 
for 
guides 
are 
(as 
was 
said) 
themselves 
also 
puzzled, 
and 
increase 
the 
number 
of 
errors 
and 
wanderers. 
In 
circumstances 
so 
difficult 
neither 
the 
natural 
force 
of 
man's 
judgment 
nor 
even 
any 
accidental 
felicity 
offers 
any 
chance 
of 
success. 
No 
excellence 
of 
wit, 
no 
repetition 
of 
chance 
experiments, 
can 
overcome 
such 
difficulties 
as 
these. 
Our 
steps 
must 
be 
guided 
by 
a 
clue, 
and 
the 
whole 
way 
from 
the 
very 
first 
perception 
of 
the 
senses 
must 
be 
laid 
out 
upon 
a 
sure 
plan. 
Not 
that 
I 
would 
be 
understood 
to 
mean 
that 
nothing 
whatever 
has 
been 
done 
in 
so 
many 
ages 
by 
so 
great 
labors. 
We 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
be 
ashamed 
of 
the 
discoveries 
which 
have 
been 
made, 
and 
no 
doubt 
the 
ancients 
proved 
themselves 
in 
everything 
that 
turns 
on 
wit 
and 
abstract 
meditation, 
wonderful 
men. 
But, 
as 
in 
former 
ages, 
when 
men 
sailed 
only 
by 
observation 
of 
the 
stars, 
they 
could 
indeed 
coast 
along 
the 
shores 
of 
the 
old 



continent 
or 
cross 
a 
few 
small 
and 
Mediterranean 
seas; 
but 
before 
the 
ocean 
could 
be 
traversed 
and 
the 
new 
world 
discovered, 
the 
use 
of 
the 
mariner's 
needle, 
as 
a 
more 
faithful 
and 
certain 
guide, 
had 
to 
be 
found 
out; 
in 
like 
manner 
the 
discoveries 
which 
have 
been 
hitherto 
made 
in 
the 
arts 
and 
sciences 
are 
such 
as 
might 
be 
made 
by 
practice, 
meditation, 
observation, 
argumentation 
â€” 
for 
they 
lay 
near 
to 
the 
senses 
and 
immediately 
beneath 
common 
notions; 
but 
before 
we 
can 
reach 
the 
remoter 
and 
more 
hidden 
parts 
of 
nature, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
a 
more 
perfect 
use 
and 
application 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
and 
intellect 
be 
introduced. 


For 
my 
own 
part 
at 
least, 
in 
obedience 
to 
the 
everlasting 
love 
of 
truth, 
I 
have 
committed 
myself 
to 
the 
uncertainties 
and 
difficulties 
and 
solitudes 
of 
the 
ways 
and, 
relying 
on 
the 
divine 
assistance, 
have 
upheld 
my 
mind 
both 
against 
the 
shocks 
and 
embattled 
ranks 
of 
opinion, 
and 
against 
my 
own 
private 
and 
inward 
hesitations 
and 
scruples, 
and 
against 
the 
fogs 
and 
clouds 
of 
nature, 
and 
the 
phantoms 
flitting 
about 
on 
every 
side, 
in 
the 
hope 
of 
providing 
at 
last 
for 
the 
present 
and 
future 
generations 
guidance 
more 
faithful 
and 
secure. 
Wherein 
if 
I 
have 
made 
any 
progress, 
the 
way 
has 
been 
opened 
to 
me 
by 
no 
other 
means 
than 
the 
true 
and 
legitimate 
humiliation 
of 
the 
human 
spirit. 
For 
all 
those 
who 
before 
me 
have 
applied 
themselves 
to 
the 
invention 
of 
arts 
have 
but 
cast 
a 
glance 
or 
two 
upon 
facts 
and 
examples 
and 
experience, 
and 
straightway 
proceeded, 
as 
if 
invention 
were 
nothing 
more 
than 
an 
exercise 
of 
thought, 
to 
invoke 
their 
own 
spirits 
to 
give 
them 
oracles. 
I, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
dwelling 
purely 
and 
constantly 
among 
the 
facts 
of 
nature, 
withdraw 
my 
intellect 
from 
them 
no 
further 
than 
may 
suffice 
to 
let 
the 
images 
and 
rays 
of 
natural 
objects 
meet 
in 
a 
point, 
as 
they 
do 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
vision; 
whence 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
strength 
and 
excellence 
of 
the 
wit 
has 
but 
little 
to 
do 
in 
the 
matter. 
And 
the 
same 
humility 
which 
I 
use 
in 
inventing 
I 
employ 
likewise 
in 
teaching. 
For 
I 
do 
not 
endeavor 
either 
by 
triumphs 
of 
confutation, 
or 
pleadings 
of 
antiquity, 
or 
assumption 
of 
authority, 
or 
even 
by 
the 
veil 
of 
obscurity, 
to 
invest 
these 
inventions 
of 
mine 
with 
any 
majesty; 
which 
might 
easily 
be 
done 
by 
one 
who 
sought 
to 
give 
luster 
to 
his 
own 
name 
rather 
than 
light 
to 
other 
men's 
minds. 
I 
have 
not 
sought 
(I 
say) 
nor 
do 
I 
seek 
either 
to 
force 
or 
ensnare 
men's 
judgments, 
but 
I 
lead 
them 
to 
things 
themselves 
and 
the 
concordances 
of 
things, 
that 
they 
may 
see 
for 
themselves 
what 
they 
have, 
what 
they 
can 
dispute, 
what 
they 
can 
add 
and 
contribute 
to 
the 
common 
stock. 
And 
for 
myself, 
if 
in 
anything 
I 
have 
been 
either 
too 
credulous 
or 
too 
little 
awake 
and 
attentive, 
or 
if 
I 
have 
fallen 
off 
by 
the 
way 
and 
left 
the 



inquiry 
incomplete, 
nevertheless 
I 
so 
present 
these 
things 
naked 
and 
open, 
that 
my 
errors 
can 
be 
marked 
and 
set 
aside 
before 
the 
mass 
of 
knowledge 
be 
further 
infected 
by 
them; 
and 
it 
will 
be 
easy 
also 
for 
others 
to 
continue 
and 
carry 
on 
my 
labors. 
And 
by 
these 
means 
I 
suppose 
that 
I 
have 
established 
forever 
a 
true 
and 
lawful 
marriage 
between 
the 
empirical 
and 
the 
rational 
faculty, 
the 
unkind 
and 
ill-starred 
divorce 
and 
separation 
of 
which 
has 
thrown 
into 
confusion 
all 
the 
affairs 
of 
the 
human 
family. 


Wherefore, 
seeing 
that 
these 
things 
do 
not 
depend 
upon 
myself, 
at 
the 
outset 
of 
the 
work 
I 
most 
humbly 
and 
fervently 
pray 
to 
God 
the 
Father, 
God 
the 
Son, 
and 
God 
the 
Holy 
Ghost, 
that 
remembering 
the 
sorrows 
of 
mankind 
and 
the 
pilgrimage 
of 
this 
our 
life 
wherein 
we 
wear 
out 
days 
few 
and 
evil, 
they 
will 
vouchsafe 
through 
my 
hands 
to 
endow 
the 
human 
family 
with 
new 
mercies. 
This 
likewise 
I 
humbly 
pray, 
that 
things 
human 
may 
not 
interfere 
with 
things 
divine, 
and 
that 
from 
the 
opening 
of 
the 
ways 
of 
sense 
and 
the 
increase 
of 
natural 
light 
there 
may 
arise 
in 
our 
minds 
no 
incredulity 
or 
darkness 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
divine 
mysteries, 
but 
rather 
that 
the 
understanding 
being 
thereby 
purified 
and 
purged 
of 
fancies 
and 
vanity, 
and 
yet 
not 
the 
less 
subject 
and 
entirely 
submissive 
to 
the 
divine 
oracles, 
may 
give 
to 
faith 
that 
which 
is 
faith's. 
Lastly, 
that 
knowledge 
being 
now 
discharged 
of 
that 
venom 
which 
the 
serpent 
infused 
into 
it, 
and 
which 
makes 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
to 
swell, 
we 
may 
not 
be 
wise 
above 
measure 
and 
sobriety, 
but 
cultivate 
truth 
in 
charity. 


And 
now, 
having 
said 
my 
prayers, 
I 
turn 
to 
men, 
to 
whom 
I 
have 
certain 
salutary 
admonitions 
to 
offer 
and 
certain 
fair 
requests 
to 
make. 
My 
first 
admonition 
(which 
was 
also 
my 
prayer) 
is 
that 
men 
confine 
the 
sense 
within 
the 
limits 
of 
duty 
in 
respect 
of 
things 
divine: 
for 
the 
sense 
is 
like 
the 
sun, 
which 
reveals 
the 
face 
of 
earth, 
but 
seals 
and 
shuts 
up 
the 
face 
of 
heaven. 
My 
next, 
that 
in 
flying 
from 
this 
evil 
they 
fall 
not 
into 
the 
opposite 
error, 
which 
they 
will 
surely 
do 
if 
they 
think 
that 
the 
inquisition 
of 
nature 
is 
in 
any 
part 
interdicted 
or 
forbidden. 
For 
it 
was 
not 
that 
pure 
and 
uncorrupted 
natural 
knowledge 
whereby 
Adam 
gave 
names 
to 
the 
creatures 
according 
to 
their 
propriety, 
which, 
gave 
occasion 
to 
the 
fall. 
It 
was 
the 
ambitious 
and 
proud 
desire 
of 
moral 
knowledge 
to 
judge 
of 
good 
and 
evil, 
to 
the 
end 
that 
man 
may 
revolt 
from 
God 
and 
give 
laws 
to 
himself, 
which 
was 
the 
form 
and 
manner 
of 
the 
temptation. 
Whereas 
of 
the 
sciences 
which 
regard 
nature, 
the 
divine 
philosopher 
declares 
that 
"it 
is 
the 
glory 
of 
God 
to 
conceal 
a 
thing, 
but 
it 
is 



the 
glory 
of 
the 
King 
to 
find 
a 
thing 
out." 
Even 
as 
though 
the 
divine 
nature 
took 
pleasure 
in 
the 
innocent 
and 
kindly 
sport 
of 
children 
playing 
at 
hide-
and-seek, 
and 
vouchsafed 
of 
his 
kindness 
and 
goodness 
to 
admit 
the 
human 
spirit 
for 
his 
playfellow 
at 
that 
game. 
Lastly, 
I 
would 
address 
one 
general 
admonition 
to 
all 
â€” 
that 
they 
consider 
what 
are 
the 
true 
ends 
of 
knowledge, 
and 
that 
they 
seek 
it 
not 
either 
for 
pleasure 
of 
the 
mind, 
or 
for 
contention, 
or 
for 
superiority 
to 
others, 
or 
for 
profit, 
or 
fame, 
or 
power, 
or 
any 
of 
these 
inferior 
things, 
but 
for 
the 
benefit 
and 
use 
of 
life, 
and 
that 
they 
perfect 
and 
govern 
it 
in 
charity. 
For 
it 
was 
from 
lust 
of 
power 
that 
the 
angels 
fell, 
from 
lust 
of 
knowledge 
that 
man 
fell; 
but 
of 
charity 
there 
can 
be 
no 
excess, 
neither 
did 
angel 
or 
man 
ever 
come 
in 
danger 
by 
it. 


The 
requests 
I 
have 
to 
make 
are 
these. 
Of 
myself 
I 
say 
nothing; 
but 
in 
behalf 
of 
the 
business 
which 
is 
in 
hand 
I 
entreat 
men 
to 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
not 
an 
opinion 
to 
be 
held, 
but 
a 
work 
to 
be 
done; 
and 
to 
be 
well 
assured 
that 
I 
am 
laboring 
to 
lay 
the 
foundation, 
not 
of 
any 
sect 
or 
doctrine, 
but 
of 
human 
utility 
and 
power. 
Next, 
I 
ask 
them 
to 
deal 
fairly 
by 
their 
own 
interests, 
and 
laying 
aside 
all 
emulations 
and 
prejudices 
in 
favor 
of 
this 
or 
that 
opinion, 
to 
join 
in 
consultation 
for 
the 
common 
good; 
and 
being 
now 
freed 
and 
guarded 
by 
the 
securities 
and 
helps 
which 
I 
offer 
from 
the 
errors 
and 
impediments 
of 
the 
way, 
to 
come 
forward 
themselves 
and 
take 
part 
in 
that 
which 
remains 
to 
be 
done. 
Moreover, 
to 
be 
of 
good 
hope, 
nor 
to 
imagine 
that 
this 
Instauration 
of 
mine 
is 
a 
thing 
infinite 
and 
beyond 
the 
power 
of 
man, 
when 
it 
is 
in 
fact 
the 
true 
end 
and 
termination 
of 
infinite 
error; 
and 
seeing 
also 
that 
it 
is 
by 
no 
means 
forgetful 
of 
the 
conditions 
of 
mortality 
and 
humanity 
(for 
it 
does 
not 
suppose 
that 
the 
work 
can 
be 
altogether 
completed 
within 
one 
generation, 
but 
provides 
for 
its 
being 
taken 
up 
by 
another); 
and 
finally 
that 
it 
seeks 
for 
the 
sciences 
not 
arrogantly 
in 
the 
little 
cells 
of 
human 
wit, 
but 
with 
reverence 
in 
the 
greater 
world. 
But 
it 
is 
the 
empty 
things 
that 
are 
vast; 
things 
solid 
are 
most 
contracted 
and 
lie 
in 
little 
room. 
And 
now 
I 
have 
only 
one 
favor 
more 
to 
ask 
(else 
injustice 
to 
me 
may 
perhaps 
imperil 
the 
business 
itself) 
â€” 
that 
men 
will 
consider 
well 
how 
far, 
upon 
that 
which 
I 
must 
needs 
assert 
(if 
I 
am 
to 
be 
consistent 
with 
myself), 
they 
are 
entitled 
to 
judge 
and 
decide 
upon 
these 
doctrines 
of 
mine; 
inasmuch 
as 
all 
that 
premature 
human 
reasoning 
which 
anticipates 
inquiry, 
and 
is 
abstracted 
from 
the 
facts 
rashly 
and 
sooner 
than 
is 
fit, 
is 
by 
me 
rejected 
(so 
far 
as 
the 
inquisition 
of 
nature 
is 
concerned) 
as 
a 
thing 
uncertain, 
confused, 
and 
ill 
built 
up; 
and 
I 
cannot 
be 
fairly 
asked 
to 
abide 
by 
the 
decision 
of 
a 
tribunal 
which 
is 
itself 
on 
trial.

The 
Plan 
of 
the 
Great 
Instauration 


The 
Instauration 
includes 
six 
Parts: 


The 
Divisions 
of 
the 
Sciences 


The 
New 
Organon; 
or 
Directions 
concerning 
the 
Interpretation 
of 
Nature 


The 
Phenomena 
of 
the 
Universe; 
or 
a 
Natural 
and 
Experimental 
History 
for 
the 
Foundation 
of 
Philosophy 


The 
Ladder 
of 
the 
Intellect 


The 
Forerunners; 
or 
Anticipations 
of 
the 
New 
Philosophy 


The 
New 
Philosophy; 
or 
Active 
Science 


The 
Arguments 
of 
the 
Several 
Parts 


It 
being 
part 
of 
my 
design 
to 
set 
everything 
forth, 
as 
far 
as 
may 
be, 
plainly 
and 
perspicuously 
(for 
nakedness 
of 
the 
mind 
is 
still, 
as 
nakedness 
of 
the 
body 
once 
was, 
the 
companion 
of 
innocence 
and 
simplicity), 
let 
me 
first 
explain 
the 
order 
and 
plan 
of 
the 
work. 
I 
distribute 
it 
into 
six 
parts. 


The 
first 
part 
exhibits 
a 
summary 
or 
general 
description 
of 
the 
knowledge 
which 
the 
human 
race 
at 
present 
possesses. 
For 
I 
thought 
it 
good 
to 
make 
some 
pause 
upon 
that 
which 
is 
received; 
that 
thereby 
the 
old 
may 
be 
more 
easily 
made 
perfect 
and 
the 
new 
more 
easily 
approached. 
And 
I 
hold 
the 
improvement 
of 
that 
which 
we 
have 
to 
be 
as 
much 
an 
object 
as 
the 
acquisition 
of 
more. 
Besides 
which 
it 
will 
make 
me 
the 
better 
listened 
to; 
for 
"He 
that 
is 
ignorant 
(says 
the 
proverb) 
receives 
not 
the 
words 
of 
knowledge, 
unless 
thou 
first 
tell 
him 
that 
which 
is 
in 
his 
own 
heart." 
We 
will 
therefore 
make 
a 
coasting 
voyage 
along 
the 
shores 
of 
the 
arts 
and 
sciences 
received, 
not 
without 
importing 
into 
them 
some 
useful 
things 
by 
the 
way. 


In 
laying 
out 
the 
divisions 
of 
the 
sciences, 
however, 
I 
take 
into 
account 
not 
only 
things 
already 
invented 
and 
known, 
but 
likewise 
things 
omitted 
which 
ought 
to 
be 
there. 
For 
there 
are 
found 
in 
the 
intellectual 
as 
in 



the 
terrestrial 
globe 
waste 
regions 
as 
well 
as 
cultivated 
ones. 
It 
is 
no 
wonder, 
therefore, 
if 
I 
am 
sometimes 
obliged 
to 
depart 
from 
the 
ordinary 
divisions. 
For 
in 
adding 
to 
the 
total 
you 
necessarily 
alter 
the 
parts 
and 
sections; 
and 
the 
received 
divisions 
of 
the 
sciences 
are 
fitted 
only 
to 
the 
received 
sum 
of 
them 
as 
it 
stands 
now. 


With 
regard 
to 
those 
things 
which 
I 
shall 
mark 
as 
omitted, 
I 
intend 
not 
merely 
to 
set 
down 
a 
simple 
title 
or 
a 
concise 
argument 
of 
that 
which 
is 
wanted. 
For 
as 
often 
as 
I 
have 
occasion 
to 
report 
anything 
as 
deficient, 
the 
nature 
of 
which 
is 
at 
all 
obscure, 
so 
that 
men 
may 
not 
perhaps 
easily 
understand 
what 
I 
mean 
or 
what 
the 
work 
is 
which 
I 
have 
in 
my 
head, 
I 
shall 
always 
(provided 
it 
be 
a 
matter 
of 
any 
worth) 
take 
care 
to 
subjoin 
either 
directions 
for 
the 
execution 
of 
such 
work, 
or 
else 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
work 
itself 
executed 
by 
myself 
as 
a 
sample 
of 
the 
whole, 
thus 
giving 
assistance 
in 
every 
case 
either 
by 
work 
or 
by 
counsel. 
For 
if 
it 
were 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
my 
own 
reputation 
only 
and 
other 
men's 
interests 
were 
not 
concerned 
in 
it, 
I 
would 
not 
have 
any 
man 
think 
that 
in 
such 
cases 
merely 
some 
light 
and 
vague 
notion 
has 
crossed 
my 
mind, 
and 
that 
the 
things 
which 
I 
desire 
and 
attempt 
are 
no 
better 
than 
wishes, 
when 
they 
are 
in 
fact 
things 
which 
men 
may 
certainly 
command 
if 
they 
will, 
and 
of 
which 
I 
have 
formed 
in 
my 
own 
mind 
a 
clear 
and 
detailed 
conception. 
For 
I 
do 
not 
propose 
merely 
to 
survey 
these 
regions 
in 
my 
mind, 
like 
an 
augur 
taking 
auspices, 
but 
to 
enter 
them 
like 
a 
general 
who 
means 
to 
take 
possession. 
So 
much 
for 
the 
first 
part 
of 
the 
work. 


Having 
thus 
coasted 
past 
the 
ancient 
arts, 
the 
next 
point 
is 
to 
equip 
the 
intellect 
for 
passing 
beyond. 
To 
the 
second 
part, 
therefore, 
belongs 
the 
doctrine 
concerning 
the 
better 
and 
more 
perfect 
use 
of 
human 
reason 
in 
the 
inquisition 
of 
things, 
and 
the 
true 
helps 
of 
the 
understanding, 
that 
thereby 
(as 
far 
as 
the 
condition 
of 
mortality 
and 
humanity 
allows) 
the 
intellect 
may 
be 
raised 
and 
exalted, 
and 
made 
capable 
of 
overcoming 
the 
difficulties 
and 
obscurities 
of 
nature. 
The 
art 
which 
I 
introduce 
with 
this 
view 
(which 
I 
call 
"Interpretation 
of 
Nature") 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
logic, 
though 
the 
difference 
between 
it 
and 
the 
ordinary 
logic 
is 
great, 
indeed, 
immense. 
For 
the 
ordinary 
logic 
professes 
to 
contrive 
and 
prepare 
helps 
and 
guards 
for 
the 
understanding, 
as 
mine 
does; 
and 
in 
this 
one 
point 
they 
agree. 
But 
mine 
differs 
from 
it 
in 
three 
points 
especially 
â€” 
viz., 
in 
the 
end 
aimed 
at, 
in 
the 
order 
of 
demonstration, 
and 
in 
the 
starting 
point 
of 
the 
inquiry. 


For 
the 
end 
which 
this 
science 
of 
mine 
proposes 
is 
the 
invention 
not 



of 
arguments 
but 
of 
arts; 
not 
of 
things 
in 
accordance 
with 
principles, 
but 
of 
principles 
themselves; 
not 
of 
probable 
reasons, 
but 
of 
designations 
and 
directions 
for 
works. 
And 
as 
the 
intention 
is 
different, 
so, 
accordingly, 
is 
the 
effect; 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
one 
being 
to 
overcome 
an 
opponent 
in 
argument, 
of 
the 
other 
to 
command 
nature 
in 
action. 


In 
accordance 
with 
this 
end 
is 
also 
the 
nature 
and 
order 
of 
the 
demonstrations. 
For 
in 
the 
ordinary 
logic 
almost 
all 
the 
work 
is 
spent 
about 
the 
syllogism. 
Of 
induction, 
the 
logicians 
seem 
hardly 
to 
have 
taken 
any 
serious 
thought, 
but 
they 
pass 
it 
by 
with 
a 
slight 
notice 
and 
hasten 
on 
to 
the 
formulae 
of 
disputation. 
I, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
reject 
demonstration 
by 
syllogism 
as 
acting 
too 
confusedly 
and 
letting 
nature 
slip 
out 
of 
its 
hands. 
For 
although 
no 
one 
can 
doubt 
that 
things 
which 
agree 
in 
a 
middle 
term 
agree 
with 
one 
another 
(which 
is 
a 
proposition 
of 
mathematical 
certainty), 
yet 
it 
leaves 
an 
opening 
for 
deception, 
which 
is 
this: 
the 
syllogism 
consists 
of 
propositions 
â 
€” 
propositions 
of 
words; 
and 
words 
are 
the 
tokens 
and 
signs 
of 
notions. 
Now 
if 
the 
very 
notions 
of 
the 
mind 
(which 
are 
as 
the 
soul 
of 
words 
and 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
whole 
structure) 
be 
improperly 
and 
overhastily 
abstracted 
from 
facts, 
vague, 
not 
sufficiently 
definite, 
faulty 
â€” 
in 
short, 
in 
many 
ways, 
the 
whole 
edifice 
tumbles. 
I 
therefore 
reject 
the 
syllogism, 
and 
that 
not 
only 
as 
regards 
principles 
(for 
to 
principles 
the 
logicians 
themselves 
do 
not 
apply 
it) 
but 
also 
as 
regards 
middle 
propositions, 
which, 
though 
obtainable 
no 
doubt 
by 
the 
syllogism, 
are, 
when 
so 
obtained, 
barren 
of 
works, 
remote 
from 
practice, 
and 
altogether 
unavailable 
for 
the 
active 
department 
of 
the 
sciences. 
Although, 
therefore, 
I 
leave 
to 
the 
syllogism 
and 
these 
famous 
and 
boasted 
modes 
of 
demonstration 
their 
jurisdiction 
over 
popular 
arts 
and 
such 
as 
are 
matter 
of 
opinion 
(in 
which 
department 
I 
leave 
all 
as 
it 
is), 
yet 
in 
dealing 
with 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
I 
use 
induction 
throughout, 
and 
that 
in 
the 
minor 
propositions 
as 
well 
as 
the 
major. 
For 
I 
consider 
induction 
to 
be 
that 
form 
of 
demonstration 
which 
upholds 
the 
sense, 
and 
closes 
with 
nature, 
and 
comes 
to 
the 
very 
brink 
of 
operation, 
if 
it 
does 
not 
actually 
deal 
with 
it. 


Hence 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
order 
of 
demonstration 
is 
likewise 
inverted. 
For 
hitherto 
the 
proceeding 
has 
been 
to 
fly 
at 
once 
from 
the 
sense 
and 
particulars 
up 
to 
the 
most 
general 
propositions, 
as 
certain 
fixed 
poles 
for 
the 
argument 
to 
turn 
upon, 
and 
from 
these 
to 
derive 
the 
rest 
by 
middle 
terms 
â€” 
a 
short 
way, 
no 
doubt, 
but 
precipitate 
and 
one 
which 
will 
never 
lead 
to 
nature, 
though 
it 
offers 
an 
easy 
and 
ready 
way 
to 
disputation. 
Now 
my 
plan 
is 
to 



proceed 
regularly 
and 
gradually 
from 
one 
axiom 
to 
another, 
so 
that 
the 
most 
general 
are 
not 
reached 
till 
the 
last; 
but 
then, 
when 
you 
do 
come 
to 
them, 
you 
find 
them 
to 
be 
not 
empty 
notions 
but 
well 
defined, 
and 
such 
as 
nature 
would 
really 
recognize 
as 
her 
first 
principles, 
and 
such 
as 
lie 
at 
the 
heart 
and 
marrow 
of 
things. 


But 
the 
greatest 
change 
I 
introduce 
is 
in 
the 
form 
itself 
of 
induction 
and 
the 
judgment 
made 
thereby. 
For 
the 
induction 
of 
which 
the 
logicians 
speak, 
which 
proceeds 
by 
simple 
enumeration, 
is 
a 
puerile 
thing, 
concludes 
at 
hazard, 
is 
always 
liable 
to 
be 
upset 
by 
a 
contradictory 
instance, 
takes 
into 
account 
only 
what 
is 
known 
and 
ordinary, 
and 
leads 
to 
no 
result. 


Now 
what 
the 
sciences 
stand 
in 
need 
of 
is 
a 
form 
of 
induction 
which 
shall 
analyze 
experience 
and 
take 
it 
to 
pieces, 
and 
by 
a 
due 
process 
of 
exclusion 
and 
rejection 
lead 
to 
an 
inevitable 
conclusion. 
And 
if 
that 
ordinary 
mode 
of 
judgment 
practiced 
by 
the 
logicians 
was 
so 
laborious, 
and 
found 
exercise 
for 
such 
great 
wits, 
how 
much 
more 
labor 
must 
we 
be 
prepared 
to 
bestow 
upon 
this 
other, 
which 
is 
extracted 
not 
merely 
out 
of 
the 
depths 
of 
the 
mind, 
but 
out 
of 
the 
very 
bowels 
of 
nature. 


Nor 
is 
this 
all. 
For 
I 
also 
sink 
the 
foundations 
of 
the 
sciences 
deeper 
and 
firmer; 
and 
I 
begin 
the 
inquiry 
nearer 
the 
source 
than 
men 
have 
done 
heretofore, 
submitting 
to 
examination 
those 
things 
which 
the 
common 
logic 
takes 
on 
trust. 
For 
first, 
the 
logicians 
borrow 
the 
principles 
of 
each 
science 
from 
the 
science 
itself; 
secondly, 
they 
hold 
in 
reverence 
the 
first 
notions 
of 
the 
mind; 
and 
lastly, 
they 
receive 
as 
conclusive 
the 
immediate 
informations 
of 
the 
sense, 
when 
well 
disposed. 
Now 
upon 
the 
first 
point, 
I 
hold 
that 
true 
logic 
ought 
to 
enter 
the 
several 
provinces 
of 
science 
armed 
with 
a 
higher 
authority 
than 
belongs 
to 
the 
principles 
of 
those 
sciences 
themselves, 
and 
ought 
to 
call 
those 
putative 
principles 
to 
account 
until 
they 
are 
fully 
established. 
Then 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
first 
notions 
of 
the 
intellect, 
there 
is 
not 
one 
of 
the 
impressions 
taken 
by 
the 
intellect 
when 
left 
to 
go 
its 
own 
way, 
but 
I 
hold 
it 
as 
suspect 
and 
no 
way 
established 
until 
it 
has 
submitted 
to 
a 
new 
trial 
and 
a 
fresh 
judgment 
has 
been 
thereupon 
pronounced. 
And 
lastly, 
the 
information 
of 
the 
sense 
itself 
I 
sift 
and 
examine 
in 
many 
ways. 
For 
certain 
it 
is 
that 
the 
senses 
deceive; 
but 
then 
at 
the 
same 
time 
they 
supply 
the 
means 
of 
discovering 
their 
own 
errors; 
only 
the 
errors 
are 
here, 
the 
means 
of 
discovery 
are 
to 
seek. 



The 
sense 
fails 
in 
two 
ways. 
Sometimes 
it 
gives 
no 
information, 
sometimes 
it 
gives 
false 
information. 
For 
first, 
there 
are 
very 
many 
things 
which 
escape 
the 
sense, 
even 
when 
best 
disposed 
and 
no 
way 
obstructed, 
by 
reason 
either 
of 
the 
subtlety 
of 
the 
whole 
body 
or 
the 
minuteness 
of 
the 
parts, 
or 
distance 
of 
place, 
or 
slowness 
or 
else 
swiftness 
of 
motion, 
or 
familiarity 
of 
the 
object, 
or 
other 
causes. 
And 
again 
when 
the 
sense 
does 
apprehend 
a 
thing 
its 
apprehension 
is 
not 
much 
to 
be 
relied 
upon. 
For 
the 
testimony 
and 
information 
of 
the 
sense 
has 
reference 
always 
to 
man, 
not 
to 
the 
universe; 
and 
it 
is 
a 
great 
error 
to 
assert 
that 
the 
sense 
is 
the 
measure 
of 
things. 


To 
meet 
these 
difficulties, 
I 
have 
sought 
on 
all 
sides 
diligently 
and 
faithfully 
to 
provide 
helps 
for 
the 
sense 
â€” 
substitutes 
to 
supply 
its 
failures, 
rectifications 
to 
correct 
its 
errors; 
and 
this 
I 
endeavor 
to 
accomplish 
not 
so 
much 
by 
instruments 
as 
by 
experiments. 
For 
the 
subtlety 
of 
experiments 
is 
far 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
the 
sense 
itself, 
even 
when 
assisted 
by 
exquisite 
instruments 
â€” 
such 
experiments, 
I 
mean, 
as 
are 
skillfully 
and 
artificially 
devised 
for 
the 
express 
purpose 
of 
determining 
the 
point 
in 
question. 
To 
the 
immediate 
and 
proper 
perception 
of 
the 
sense, 
therefore, 
I 
do 
not 
give 
much 
weight; 
but 
I 
contrive 
that 
the 
office 
of 
the 
sense 
shall 
be 
only 
to 
judge 
of 
the 
experiment, 
and 
that 
the 
experiment 
itself 
shall 
judge 
of 
the 
thing. 
And 
thus 
I 
conceive 
that 
I 
perform 
the 
office 
of 
a 
true 
priest 
of 
the 
sense 
(from 
which 
all 
knowledge 
in 
nature 
must 
be 
sought, 
unless 
men 
mean 
to 
go 
mad) 
and 
a 
not 
unskillful 
interpreter 
of 
its 
oracles; 
and 
that 
while 
others 
only 
profess 
to 
uphold 
and 
cultivate 
the 
sense, 
I 
do 
so 
in 
fact. 
Such 
then 
are 
the 
provisions 
I 
make 
for 
finding 
the 
genuine 
light 
of 
nature 
and 
kindling 
and 
bringing 
it 
to 
bear. 
And 
they 
would 
be 
sufficient 
of 
themselves 
if 
the 
human 
intellect 
were 
even 
and 
like 
a 
fair 
sheet 
of 
paper 
with 
no 
writing 
on 
it. 
But 
since 
the 
minds 
of 
men 
are 
strangely 
possessed 
and 
beset 
so 
that 
there 
is 
no 
true 
and 
even 
surface 
left 
to 
reflect 
the 
genuine 
rays 
of 
things, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
seek 
a 
remedy 
for 
this 
also. 


Now 
the 
idols, 
or 
phantoms, 
by 
which 
the 
mind 
is 
occupied 
are 
either 
adventitious 
or 
innate. 
The 
adventitious 
come 
into 
the 
mind 
from 
without 
â€” 
namely, 
either 
from 
the 
doctrines 
and 
sects 
of 
philosophers 
or 
from 
perverse 
rules 
of 
demonstration. 
But 
the 
innate 
are 
inherent 
in 
the 
very 
nature 
of 
the 
intellect, 
which 
is 
far 
more 
prone 
to 
error 
than 
the 
sense 
is. 
For 
let 
men 
please 
themselves 
as 
they 
will 
in 
admiring 
and 
almost 
adoring 
the 
human 
mind, 
this 
is 
certain: 
that 
as 
an 
uneven 
mirror 
distorts 
the 
rays 
of 



objects 
according 
to 
its 
own 
figure 
and 
section, 
so 
the 
mind, 
when 
it 
receives 
impressions 
of 
objects 
through 
the 
sense, 
cannot 
be 
trusted 
to 
report 
them 
truly, 
but 
in 
forming 
its 
notions 
mixes 
up 
its 
own 
nature 
with 
the 
nature 
of 
things. 


And 
as 
the 
first 
two 
kinds 
of 
idols 
are 
hard 
to 
eradicate, 
so 
idols 
of 
this 
last 
kind 
cannot 
be 
eradicated 
at 
all. 
All 
that 
can 
be 
done 
is 
to 
point 
them 
out, 
so 
that 
this 
insidious 
action 
of 
the 
mind 
may 
be 
marked 
and 
reproved 
(else 
as 
fast 
as 
old 
errors 
are 
destroyed 
new 
ones 
will 
spring 
up 
out 
of 
the 
ill 
complexion 
of 
the 
mind 
itself, 
and 
so 
we 
shall 
have 
but 
a 
change 
of 
errors, 
and 
not 
a 
clearance); 
and 
to 
lay 
it 
down 
once 
for 
all 
as 
a 
fixed 
and 
established 
maxim 
that 
the 
intellect 
is 
not 
qualified 
to 
judge 
except 
by 
means 
of 
induction, 
and 
induction 
in 
its 
legitimate 
form. 
This 
doctrine, 
then, 
of 
the 
expurgation 
of 
the 
intellect 
to 
qualify 
it 
for 
dealing 
with 
truth 
is 
comprised 
in 
three 
refutations: 
the 
refutation 
of 
the 
philosophies; 
the 
refutation 
of 
the 
demonstrations; 
and 
the 
refutation 
of 
the 
natural 
human 
reason. 
The 
explanation 
of 
which 
things, 
and 
of 
the 
true 
relation 
between 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
mind, 
is 
as 
the 
strewing 
and 
decoration 
of 
the 
bridal 
chamber 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
the 
universe, 
the 
divine 
goodness 
assisting, 
out 
of 
which 
marriage 
let 
us 
hope 
(and 
be 
this 
the 
prayer 
of 
the 
bridal 
song) 
there 
may 
spring 
helps 
to 
man, 
and 
a 
line 
and 
race 
of 
inventions 
that 
may 
in 
some 
degree 
subdue 
and 
overcome 
the 
necessities 
and 
miseries 
of 
humanity. 
This 
is 
the 
second 
part 
of 
the 
work. 


But 
I 
design 
not 
only 
to 
indicate 
and 
mark 
out 
the 
ways, 
but 
also 
to 
enter 
them. 
And 
therefore 
the 
third 
part 
of 
the 
work 
embraces 
the 
"phenomena 
of 
the 
universe"; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
experience 
of 
every 
kind, 
and 
such 
a 
natural 
history 
as 
may 
serve 
for 
a 
foundation 
to 
build 
philosophy 
upon. 
For 
a 
good 
method 
of 
demonstration 
or 
form 
of 
interpreting 
nature 
may 
keep 
the 
mind 
from 
going 
astray 
or 
stumbling, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
any 
excellence 
of 
method 
that 
can 
supply 
it 
with 
the 
material 
of 
knowledge. 
Those, 
however, 
who 
aspire 
not 
to 
guess 
and 
divine, 
but 
to 
discover 
and 
know, 
who 
propose 
not 
to 
devise 
mimic 
and 
fabulous 
worlds 
of 
their 
own, 
but 
to 
examine 
and 
dissect 
the 
nature 
of 
this 
very 
world 
itself, 
must 
go 
to 
facts 
themselves 
for 
everything. 
Nor 
can 
the 
place 
of 
this 
labor 
and 
search 
and 
world-wide 
perambulation 
be 
supplied 
by 
any 
genius 
or 
meditation 
or 
argumentation; 
no, 
not 
if 
all 
men's 
wits 
could 
meet 
in 
one. 
This, 
therefore, 
we 
must 
have 
or 
the 
business 
must 
be 
forever 
abandoned. 
But 
up 
to 
this 
day 
such 
has 
been 
the 



condition 
of 
men 
in 
this 
matter 
that 
it 
is 
no 
wonder 
if 
nature 
will 
not 
give 
herself 
into 
their 
hands. 


For 
first, 
the 
information 
of 
the 
sense 
itself, 
sometimes 
failing, 
sometimes 
false; 
observation, 
careless, 
irregular, 
and 
led 
by 
chance; 
tradition, 
vain, 
and 
fed 
on 
rumor; 
practice, 
slavishly 
bent 
upon 
its 
work; 
experiment, 
blind, 
stupid, 
vague, 
and 
prematurely 
broken 
off; 
lastly, 
natural 
history 
trivial 
and 
poor 
â€” 
all 
these 
have 
contributed 
to 
supply 
the 
understanding 
with 
very 
bad 
materials 
for 
philosophy 
and 
the 
sciences. 


Then 
an 
attempt 
is 
made 
to 
mend 
the 
matter 
by 
a 
preposterous 
subtlety 
and 
winnowing 
of 
argument. 
But 
this 
comes 
too 
late, 
the 
case 
being 
already 
past 
remedy, 
and 
is 
far 
from 
setting 
the 
business 
right 
or 
sifting 
away 
the 
errors. 
The 
only 
hope, 
therefore, 
of 
any 
greater 
increase 
or 
progress 
lies 
in 
a 
reconstruction 
of 
the 
sciences. 


Of 
this 
reconstruction 
the 
foundation 
must 
be 
laid 
in 
natural 
history, 
and 
that 
of 
a 
new 
kind 
and 
gathered 
on 
a 
new 
principle. 
For 
it 
is 
in 
vain 
that 
you 
polish 
the 
mirror 
if 
there 
are 
no 
images 
to 
be 
reflected; 
and 
it 
is 
as 
necessary 
that 
the 
intellect 
should 
be 
supplied 
with 
fit 
matter 
to 
work 
upon, 
as 
with 
safeguards 
to 
guide 
its 
working. 
But 
my 
history 
differs 
from 
that 
in 
use 
(as 
my 
logic 
does) 
in 
many 
things 
â€” 
in 
end 
and 
office, 
in 
mass 
and 
composition, 
in 
subtlety, 
in 
selection 
also, 
and 
setting 
forth, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
the 
operations 
which 
are 
to 
follow. 


For 
first, 
the 
object 
of 
the 
natural 
history 
which 
I 
propose 
is 
not 
so 
much 
to 
delight 
with 
variety 
of 
matter 
or 
to 
help 
with 
present 
use 
of 
experiments, 
as 
to 
give 
light 
to 
the 
discovery 
of 
causes 
and 
supply 
a 
suckling 
philosophy 
with 
its 
first 
food. 
For 
though 
it 
be 
true 
that 
I 
am 
principally 
in 
pursuit 
of 
works 
and 
the 
active 
department 
of 
the 
sciences, 
yet 
I 
wait 
for 
harvest-time 
and 
do 
not 
attempt 
to 
mow 
the 
moss 
or 
to 
reap 
the 
green 
corn. 
For 
I 
well 
know 
that 
axioms 
once 
rightly 
discovered 
will 
carry 
whole 
troops 
of 
works 
along 
with 
them, 
and 
produce 
them, 
not 
here 
and 
there 
one, 
but 
in 
clusters. 
And 
that 
unseasonable 
and 
puerile 
hurry 
to 
snatch 
by 
way 
of 
earnest 
at 
the 
first 
works 
which 
come 
within 
reach, 
I 
utterly 
condemn 
and 
reject 
as 
an 
Atalanta's 
apple 
that 
hinders 
the 
race.1 
Such 
then 
is 
the 
office 
of 
this 
natural 
history 
of 
mine. 


Next, 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
mass 
and 
composition 
of 
it: 
I 
mean 
it 
to 
be 
a 
history 
not 
only 
of 
nature 
free 
and 
at 
large 
(when 
she 
is 
left 
to 
her 
own 
course 



and 
does 
her 
work 
her 
own 
way) 
â€” 
such 
as 
that 
of 
the 
heavenly 
bodies, 
meteors, 
earth 
and 
sea, 
minerals, 
plants, 
animals 
â€” 
but 
much 
more 
of 
nature 
under 
constraint 
and 
vexed; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
when 
by 
art 
and 
the 
hand 
of 
man 
she 
is 
forced 
out 
of 
her 
natural 
state, 
and 
squeezed 
and 
moulded. 
Therefore 
I 
set 
down 
at 
length 
all 
experiments 
of 
the 
mechanical 
arts, 
of 
the 
operative 
part 
of 
the 
liberal 
arts, 
of 
the 
many 
crafts 
which 
have 
not 
yet 
grown 
into 
arts 
properly 
so 
called, 
so 
far 
as 
I 
have 
been 
able 
to 
examine 
them 
and 
as 
they 
conduce 
to 
the 
end 
in 
view. 
Nay 
(to 
say 
the 
plain 
truth), 
I 
do 
in 
fact 
(low 
and 
vulgar 
as 
men 
may 
think 
it) 
count 
more 
upon 
this 
part 
both 
for 
helps 
and 
safeguards 
than 
upon 
the 
other, 
seeing 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
betrays 
itself 
more 
readily 
under 
the 
vexations 
of 
art 
than 
in 
its 
natural 
freedom. 


Nor 
do 
I 
confine 
the 
history 
to 
bodies, 
but 
I 
have 
thought 
it 
my 
duty 
besides 
to 
make 
a 
separate 
history 
of 
such 
virtues 
as 
may 
be 
considered 
cardinal 
in 
nature. 
I 
mean 
those 
original 
passions 
or 
desires 
of 
matter 
which 
constitute 
the 
primary 
elements 
of 
nature; 
such 
as 
dense 
and 
rare, 
hot 
and 
cold, 
solid 
and 
fluid, 
heavy 
and 
light, 
and 
several 
others. 


Then 
again, 
to 
speak 
of 
subtlety: 
I 
seek 
out 
and 
get 
together 
a 
kind 
of 
experiments 
much 
subtler 
and 
simpler 
than 
those 
which 
occur 
accidentally. 
For 
I 
drag 
into 
light 
many 
things 
which 
no 
one 
who 
was 
not 
proceeding 
by 
a 
regular 
and 
certain 
way 
to 
the 
discovery 
of 
causes 
would 
have 
thought 
of 
inquiring 
after, 
being 
indeed 
in 
themselves 
of 
no 
great 
use; 
which 
shows 
that 
they 
were 
not 
sought 
for 
on 
their 
own 
account, 
but 
having 
just 
the 
same 
relation 
to 
things 
and 
works 
which 
the 
letters 
of 
the 
alphabet 
have 
to 
speech 
and 
words 
â€” 
which, 
though 
in 
themselves 
useless, 
are 
the 
elements 
of 
which 
all 
discourse 
is 
made 
up. 


Further, 
in 
the 
selection 
of 
the 
relation 
and 
experiments 
I 
conceive 
I 
have 
been 
a 
more 
cautious 
purveyor 
than 
those 
who 
have 
hitherto 
dealt 
with 
natural 
history. 
For 
I 
admit 
nothing 
but 
on 
the 
faith 
of 
eyes, 
or 
at 
least 
of 
careful 
and 
severe 
examination, 
so 
that 
nothing 
is 
exaggerated 
for 
wonder's 
sake, 
but 
what 
I 
state 
is 
sound 
and 
without 
mixture 
of 
fables 
or 
vanity. 
All 
received 
or 
current 
falsehoods 
also 
(which 
by 
strange 
negligence 
have 
been 
allowed 
for 
many 
ages 
to 
prevail 
and 
become 
established) 
I 
proscribe 
and 
brand 
by 
name, 
that 
the 
sciences 
may 
be 
no 
more 
troubled 
with 
them. 
For 
it 
has 
been 
well 
observed 
that 
the 
fables 
and 
superstitions 
and 
follies 
which 
nurses 
instill 
into 
children 
do 
serious 
injury 
to 
their 
minds; 
and 
the 
same 
consideration 
makes 
me 
anxious, 
having 
the 
management 
of 
the 
childhood, 



as 
it 
were, 
of 
philosophy 
in 
its 
course 
of 
natural 
history, 
not 
to 
let 
it 
accustom 
itself 
in 
the 
beginning 
to 
any 
vanity. 
Moreover, 
whenever 
I 
come 
to 
a 
new 
experiment 
of 
any 
subtlety 
(though 
it 
be 
in 
my 
own 
opinion 
certain 
and 
approved), 
I 
nevertheless 
subjoin 
a 
clear 
account 
of 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
I 
made 
it, 
that 
men, 
knowing 
exactly 
how 
each 
point 
was 
made 
out, 
may 
see 
whether 
there 
be 
any 
error 
connected 
with 
it 
and 
may 
arouse 
themselves 
to 
devise 
proofs 
more 
trustworthy 
and 
exquisite, 
if 
such 
can 
be 
found; 
and 
finally, 
I 
interpose 
everywhere 
admonitions 
and 
scruples 
and 
cautions, 
with 
a 
religious 
care 
to 
eject, 
repress, 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
exorcise 
every 
kind 
of 
phantasm. 


Lastly, 
knowing 
how 
much 
the 
sight 
of 
man's 
mind 
is 
distracted 
by 
experience 
and 
history, 
and 
how 
hard 
it 
is 
at 
the 
first 
(especially 
for 
minds 
either 
tender 
or 
preoccupied) 
to 
become 
familiar 
with 
nature, 
I 
not 
unfrequently 
subjoin 
observations 
of 
my 
own, 
being 
as 
the 
first 
offers 
inclinations, 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
glances 
of 
history 
toward 
philosophy, 
both 
by 
way 
of 
an 
assurance 
to 
men 
that 
they 
will 
not 
be 
kept 
forever 
tossing 
on 
the 
waves 
of 
experience, 
and 
also 
that 
when 
the 
time 
comes 
for 
the 
intellect 
to 
begin 
its 
work, 
it 
may 
find 
everything 
the 
more 
ready. 
By 
such 
a 
natural 
history, 
then, 
as 
I 
have 
described, 
I 
conceive 
that 
a 
safe 
and 
convenient 
approach 
may 
be 
made 
to 
nature, 
and 
matter 
supplied 
of 
good 
quality 
and 
well 
prepared 
for 
the 
understanding 
to 
work 
upon. 


And 
now 
that 
we 
have 
surrounded 
the 
intellect 
with 
faithful 
helps 
and 
guards, 
and 
got 
together 
with 
most 
careful 
selection 
a 
regular 
army 
of 
divine 
works, 
it 
may 
seem 
that 
we 
have 
no 
more 
to 
do 
but 
to 
proceed 
to 
philosophy 
itself. 
And 
yet 
in 
a 
matter 
so 
difficult 
and 
doubtful 
there 
are 
still 
some 
things 
which 
it 
seems 
necessary 
to 
premise, 
partly 
for 
convenience 
of 
explanation, 
partly 
for 
present 
use. 


Of 
these 
the 
first 
is 
to 
set 
forth 
examples 
of 
inquiry 
and 
invention 
according 
to 
my 
method, 
exhibited 
by 
anticipation 
in 
some 
particular 
subjects; 
choosing 
such 
subjects 
as 
are 
at 
once 
the 
most 
noble 
in 
themselves 
among 
those 
under 
inquiry, 
and 
most 
different 
one 
from 
another, 
that 
there 
may 
be 
an 
example 
in 
every 
kind. 
I 
do 
not 
speak 
of 
those 
examples 
which 
are 
joined 
to 
the 
several 
precepts 
and 
rules 
by 
way 
of 
illustration 
(for 
of 
these 
I 
have 
given 
plenty 
in 
the 
second 
part 
of 
the 
work); 
but 
I 
mean 
actual 
types 
and 
models, 
by 
which 
the 
entire 
process 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
the 
whole 
fabric 
and 
order 
of 
invention 
from 
the 
beginning 
to 
the 
end, 
in 
certain 
subjects, 
and 



those 
various 
and 
remarkable, 
should 
be 
set, 
as 
it 
were, 
before 
the 
eyes. 
For 
I 
remember 
that 
in 
the 
mathematics 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
follow 
the 
demonstration 
when 
you 
have 
a 
machine 
beside 
you, 
whereas 
without 
that 
help 
all 
appears 
involved 
and 
more 
subtle 
than 
it 
really 
is. 
To 
examples 
of 
this 
kind 
â€” 
being 
in 
fact 
nothing 
more 
than 
an 
application 
of 
the 
second 
part 
in 
detail 
and 
at 
large 
â€” 
the 
fourth 
part 
of 
the 
work 
is 
devoted. 


The 
fifth 
part 
is 
for 
temporary 
use 
only, 
pending 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
rest, 
like 
interest 
payable 
from 
time 
to 
time 
until 
the 
principal 
be 
forthcoming. 
For 
I 
do 
not 
make 
so 
blindly 
for 
the 
end 
of 
my 
journey 
as 
to 
neglect 
anything 
useful 
that 
may 
turn 
up 
by 
the 
way. 
And 
therefore 
I 
include 
in 
this 
part 
such 
things 
as 
I 
have 
myself 
discovered, 
proved, 
or 
added 
â€” 
not, 
however, 
according 
to 
the 
true 
rules 
and 
methods 
of 
interpretation, 
but 
by 
the 
ordinary 
use 
of 
the 
understanding 
in 
inquiring 
and 
discovering. 
For 
besides 
that 
I 
hope 
my 
speculations 
may, 
in 
virtue 
of 
my 
continual 
conversancy 
with 
nature, 
have 
a 
value 
beyond 
the 
pretensions 
of 
my 
wit, 
they 
will 
serve 
in 
the 
meantime 
for 
wayside 
inns, 
in 
which 
the 
mind 
may 
rest 
and 
refresh 
itself 
on 
its 
journey 
to 
more 
certain 
conclusions. 
Nevertheless 
I 
wish 
it 
to 
be 
understood 
in 
the 
meantime 
that 
they 
are 
conclusions 
by 
which 
(as 
not 
being 
discovered 
and 
proved 
by 
the 
true 
form 
of 
interpretation) 
I 
do 
not 
at 
all 
mean 
to 
bind 
myself. 
Nor 
need 
any 
one 
be 
alarmed 
at 
such 
suspension 
of 
judgment 
in 
one 
who 
maintains 
not 
simply 
that 
nothing 
can 
be 
known, 
but 
only 
that 
nothing 
can 
be 
known 
except 
in 
a 
certain 
course 
and 
way; 
and 
yet 
establishes 
provisionally 
certain 
degrees 
of 
assurance 
for 
use 
and 
relief 
until 
the 
mind 
shall 
arrive 
at 
a 
knowledge 
of 
causes 
in 
which 
it 
can 
rest. 
For 
even 
those 
schools 
of 
philosophy 
which 
held 
the 
absolute 
impossibility 
of 
knowing 
anything 
were 
not 
inferior 
to 
those 
which 
took 
upon 
them 
to 
pronounce. 
But 
then 
they 
did 
not 
provide 
helps 
for 
the 
sense 
and 
understanding, 
as 
I 
have 
done, 
but 
simply 
took 
away 
all 
their 
authority; 
which 
is 
quite 
a 
different 
thing 
â€” 
almost 
the 
reverse. 


The 
sixth 
part 
of 
my 
work 
(to 
which 
the 
rest 
is 
subservient 
and 
ministrant) 
discloses 
and 
sets 
forth 
that 
philosophy 
which 
by 
the 
legitimate, 
chaste, 
and 
severe 
course 
of 
inquiry 
which 
I 
have 
explained 
and 
provided 
is 
at 
length 
developed 
and 
established. 
The 
completion, 
however, 
of 
this 
last 
part 
is 
a 
thing 
both 
above 
my 
strength 
and 
beyond 
my 
hopes. 
I 
have 
made 
a 
beginning 
of 
the 
work 
â€” 
a 
beginning, 
as 
I 
hope, 
not 
unimportant: 
the 
fortune 
of 
the 
human 
race 
will 
give 
the 
issue, 
such 
an 
issue, 
it 
may 
be, 
as 
in 



the 
present 
condition 
of 
things 
and 
men's 
minds 
cannot 
easily 
be 
conceived 
or 
imagined. 
For 
the 
matter 
in 
hand 
is 
no 
mere 
felicity 
of 
speculation, 
but 
the 
real 
business 
and 
fortunes 
of 
the 
human 
race, 
and 
all 
power 
of 
operation. 
For 
man 
is 
but 
the 
servant 
and 
interpreter 
of 
nature: 
what 
he 
does 
and 
what 
he 
knows 
is 
only 
what 
he 
has 
observed 
of 
nature's 
order 
in 
fact 
or 
in 
thought; 
beyond 
this 
he 
knows 
nothing 
and 
can 
do 
nothing. 
For 
the 
chain 
of 
causes 
cannot 
by 
any 
force 
be 
loosed 
or 
broken, 
nor 
can 
nature 
be 
commanded 
except 
by 
being 
obeyed. 
And 
so 
those 
twin 
objects, 
human 
knowledge 
and 
human 
power, 
do 
really 
meet 
in 
one; 
and 
it 
is 
from 
ignorance 
of 
causes 
that 
operation 
fails. 


And 
all 
depends 
on 
keeping 
the 
eye 
steadily 
fixed 
upon 
the 
facts 
of 
nature 
and 
so 
receiving 
their 
images 
simply 
as 
they 
are. 
For 
God 
forbid 
that 
we 
should 
give 
out 
a 
dream 
of 
our 
own 
imagination 
for 
a 
pattern 
of 
the 
world; 
rather 
may 
he 
graciously 
grant 
to 
us 
to 
write 
an 
apocalypse 
or 
true 
vision 
of 
the 
footsteps 
of 
the 
Creator 
imprinted 
on 
his 
creatures. 


Therefore 
do 
thou, 
O 
Father, 
who 
gavest 
the 
visible 
light 
as 
the 
first 
fruits 
of 
creation, 
and 
didst 
breathe 
into 
the 
face 
of 
man 
the 
intellectual 
light 
as 
the 
crown 
and 
consummation 
thereof, 
guard 
and 
protect 
this 
work, 
which 
coming 
from 
thy 
goodness 
returneth 
to 
thy 
glory. 
Thou 
when 
thou 
turnedst 
to 
look 
upon 
the 
works 
which 
thy 
hands 
had 
made, 
sawest 
that 
all 
was 
very 
good, 
and 
didst 
rest 
from 
thy 
labors. 
But 
man, 
when 
he 
turned 
to 
look 
upon 
the 
work 
which 
his 
hands 
had 
made, 
saw 
that 
all 
was 
vanity 
and 
vexation 
of 
spirit, 
and 
could 
find 
no 
rest 
therein. 
Wherefore 
if 
we 
labor 
in 
thy 
works 
with 
the 
sweat 
of 
our 
brows, 
thou 
wilt 
make 
us 
partakers 
of 
thy 
vision 
and 
thy 
sabbath. 
Humbly 
we 
pray 
that 
this 
mind 
may 
be 
steadfast 
in 
us, 
and 
that 
through 
these 
our 
hands, 
and 
the 
hands 
of 
others 
to 
whom 
thou 
shall 
give 
the 
same 
spirit, 
thou 
wilt 
vouchsafe 
to 
endow 
the 
human 
family 
with 
new 
mercies.

That 
was 
the 
original 
title-page 
of 
the 
book 
now 
in 
the 
reader’s 
hand 
— 
a 
living 
book 
that 
led 
the 
way 
to 
a 
new 
world 
of 
thought. 
It 
was 
the 
book 
in 
which 
Bacon, 
early 
in 
the 
reign 
of 
James 
the 
First, 
prepared 
the 
way 
for 
a 
full 
setting 
forth 
of 
his 
New 
Organon, 
or 
instrument 
of 
knowledge. 


The 
Organon 
of 
Aristotle 
was 
a 
set 
of 
treatises 
in 
which 
Aristotle 
had 
written 
the 
doctrine 
of 
propositions. 
Study 
of 
these 
treatises 
was 
a 
chief 
occupation 
of 
young 
men 
when 
they 
passed 
from 
school 
to 
college, 
and 
proceeded 
from 
Grammar 
to 
Logic, 
the 
second 
of 
the 
Seven 
Sciences. 
Francis 
Bacon 
as 
a 
youth 
of 
sixteen, 
at 
Trinity 
College, 
Cambridge, 
felt 
the 
unfruitfulness 
of 
this 
method 
of 
search 
after 
truth. 
He 
was 
the 
son 
of 
Sir 
Nicholas 
Bacon, 
Queen 
Elizabeth’s 
Lord 
Keeper, 
and 
was 
born 
at 
York 
House, 
in 
the 
Strand, 
on 
the 
22nd 
of 
January, 
1561. 
His 
mother 
was 
the 
Lord 
Keeper’s 
second 
wife, 
one 
of 
two 
sisters, 
of 
whom 
the 
other 
married 
Sir 
William 
Cecil, 
afterwards 
Lord 
Burleigh. 
Sir 
Nicholas 
Bacon 
had 
six 
children 
by 
his 
former 
marriage, 
and 
by 
his 
second 
wife 
two 
sons, 
Antony 
and 
Francis, 
of 
whom 
Antony 
was 
about 
two 
years 
the 
elder. 
The 
family 
home 
was 
at 
York 
Place, 
and 
at 
Gorhambury, 
near 
St. 
Albans, 
from 
which 
town, 
in 
its 
ancient 
and 
its 
modern 
style, 
Bacon 
afterwards 
took 
his 
titles 
of 
Verulam 
and 
St. 
Albans. 


Antony 
and 
Francis 
Bacon 
went 
together 
to 
Trinity 
College, 
Cambridge, 
when 
Antony 
was 
fourteen 
years 
old 
and 
Francis 
twelve. 
Francis 
remained 
at 
Cambridge 
only 
until 
his 
sixteenth 
year; 
and 
Dr. 
Rawley, 
his 
chaplain 
in 
after-years, 
reports 
of 
him 
that 
“whilst 
he 
was 
commorant 
in 
the 
University, 
about 
sixteen 
years 
of 
age 
(as 
his 
lordship 
hath 
been 
pleased 
to 
impart 
unto 
myself), 
he 
first 
fell 
into 
dislike 
of 
the 
philosophy 
of 
Aristotle; 
not 
for 
the 
worthlessness 
of 
the 
author, 
to 
whom 
he 
would 
ascribe 
all 
high 
attributes, 
but 
for 
the 
unfruitfulness 
of 
the 
way, 
being 
a 
philosophy 
(as 
his 
lordship 
used 
to 
say) 
only 
strong 
for 
disputatious 
and 
contentions, 
but 
barren 



of 
the 
production 
of 
works 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
life 
of 
man; 
in 
which 
mind 
he 
continued 
to 
his 
dying 
day.” 
Bacon 
was 
sent 
as 
a 
youth 
of 
sixteen 
to 
Paris 
with 
the 
ambassador 
Sir 
Amyas 
Paulet, 
to 
begin 
his 
training 
for 
the 
public 
service; 
but 
his 
father’s 
death, 
in 
February, 
1579, 
before 
he 
had 
completed 
the 
provision 
he 
was 
making 
for 
his 
youngest 
children, 
obliged 
him 
to 
return 
to 
London, 
and, 
at 
the 
age 
of 
eighteen, 
to 
settle 
down 
at 
Gray’s 
Inn 
to 
the 
study 
of 
law 
as 
a 
profession. 
He 
was 
admitted 
to 
the 
outer 
bar 
in 
June, 
1582, 
and 
about 
that 
time, 
at 
the 
age 
of 
twenty-one, 
wrote 
a 
sketch 
of 
his 
conception 
of 
a 
New 
Organon 
that 
should 
lead 
man 
to 
more 
fruitful 
knowledge, 
in 
a 
little 
Latin 
tract, 
which 
he 
called 
“Temporis 
Partus 
Maximus” 
(“The 
Greatest 
Birth 
of 
Time”). 


In 
November, 
1584, 
Bacon 
took 
his 
seat 
in 
the 
House 
of 
Commons 
as 
member 
for 
Melcombe 
Regis, 
in 
Dorsetshire. 
In 
October, 
1586, 
he 
sat 
for 
Taunton. 
He 
was 
member 
afterwards 
for 
Liverpool; 
and 
he 
was 
one 
of 
those 
who 
petitioned 
for 
the 
speedy 
execution 
of 
Mary 
Queen 
of 
Scots. 
In 
October, 
1589, 
he 
obtained 
the 
reversion 
of 
the 
office 
of 
Clerk 
of 
the 
Council 
in 
the 
Star 
Chamber, 
which 
was 
worth 
1,600 
pounds 
or 
2,000 
pounds 
a 
year; 
but 
for 
the 
succession 
to 
this 
office 
he 
had 
to 
wait 
until 
1608. 
It 
had 
not 
yet 
fallen 
to 
him 
when 
he 
wrote 
his 
“Two 
Books 
of 
the 
Advancement 
of 
Learning.” 
In 
the 
Parliament 
that 
met 
in 
February, 
1593, 
Bacon 
sat 
as 
member 
for 
Middlesex. 
He 
raised 
difficulties 
of 
procedure 
in 
the 
way 
of 
the 
grant 
of 
a 
treble 
subsidy, 
by 
just 
objection 
to 
the 
joining 
of 
the 
Lords 
with 
the 
Commons 
in 
a 
money 
grant, 
and 
a 
desire 
to 
extend 
the 
time 
allowed 
for 
payment 
from 
three 
years 
to 
six; 
it 
was, 
in 
fact, 
extended 
to 
four 
years. 
The 
Queen 
was 
offended. 
Francis 
Bacon 
and 
his 
brother 
Antony 
had 
attached 
themselves 
to 
the 
young 
Earl 
of 
Essex, 
who 
was 
their 
friend 
and 
patron. 
The 
office 
of 
Attorney-General 
became 
vacant. 
Essex 
asked 
the 
Queen 
to 
appoint 
Francis 
Bacon. 
The 
Queen 
gave 
the 
office 
to 
Sir 
Edward 
Coke, 
who 
was 
already 
Solicitor-General, 
and 
by 
nine 
years 
Bacon’s 
senior. 
The 
office 
of 
Solicitor-General 
thus 
became 
vacant, 
and 
that 
was 
sought 
for 
Francis 
Bacon. 
The 
Queen, 
after 
delay 
and 
hesitation, 
gave 
it, 
in 
November, 
1595, 
to 
Serjeant 
Fleming. 
The 
Earl 
of 
Essex 
consoled 
his 
friend 
by 
giving 
him 
“a 
piece 
of 
land”— 
Twickenham 
Park 
— 
which 
Bacon 
afterwards 
sold 
for 
1,800 
pounds 
— 
equal, 
say, 
to 
12,000 
pounds 
in 
present 
buying 
power. 
In 
1597 
Bacon 
was 
returned 
to 
Parliament 
as 
member 
for 
Ipswich, 
and 
in 
that 
year 
he 
was 
hoping 
to 
marry 
the 
rich 
widow 
of 
Sir 
William 
Hatton, 
Essex 
helping; 
but 
the 
lady 
married, 
in 
the 
next 
year, 
Sir 
Edward 
Coke. 
It 
was 
in 
1597 
that 
Bacon 
published 
the 
First 



Edition 
of 
his 
Essays. 
That 
was 
a 
little 
book 
containing 
only 
ten 
essays 
in 
English, 
with 
twelve 
“Meditationes 
Sacrae,” 
which 
were 
essays 
in 
Latin 
on 
religious 
subjects. 
From 
1597 
onward 
to 
the 
end 
of 
his 
life, 
Bacon’s 
Essays 
were 
subject 
to 
continuous 
addition 
and 
revision. 
The 
author’s 
Second 
Edition, 
in 
which 
the 
number 
of 
the 
Essays 
was 
increased 
from 
ten 
to 
thirty-
eight, 
did 
not 
appear 
until 
November 
or 
December, 
1612, 
seven 
years 
later 
than 
these 
two 
books 
on 
the 
“Advancement 
of 
Learning;” 
and 
the 
final 
edition 
of 
the 
Essays, 
in 
which 
their 
number 
was 
increased 
from 
thirty-eight 
to 
fifty-eight, 
appeared 
only 
in 
1625; 
and 
Bacon 
died 
on 
the 
9th 
of 
April, 
1626. 
The 
edition 
of 
the 
Essays 
published 
in 
1597, 
under 
Elizabeth, 
marked 
only 
the 
beginning 
of 
a 
course 
of 
thought 
that 
afterwards 
flowed 
in 
one 
stream 
with 
his 
teachings 
in 
philosophy. 


In 
February, 
1601, 
there 
was 
the 
rebellion 
of 
Essex. 
Francis 
Bacon 
had 
separated 
himself 
from 
his 
patron 
after 
giving 
him 
advice 
that 
was 
disregarded. 
Bacon, 
now 
Queen’s 
Counsel, 
not 
only 
appeared 
against 
his 
old 
friend, 
but 
with 
excess 
of 
zeal, 
by 
which, 
perhaps, 
he 
hoped 
to 
win 
back 
the 
Queen’s 
favour, 
he 
twice 
obtruded 
violent 
attacks 
upon 
Essex 
when 
he 
was 
not 
called 
upon 
to 
speak. 
On 
the 
25th 
of 
February, 
1601, 
Essex 
was 
beheaded. 
The 
genius 
of 
Bacon 
was 
next 
employed 
to 
justify 
that 
act 
by 
“A 
Declaration 
of 
the 
Practices 
and 
Treasons 
attempted 
and 
committed 
by 
Robert 
late 
Earle 
of 
Essex 
and 
his 
Complices.” 
But 
James 
of 
Scotland, 
on 
whose 
behalf 
Essex 
had 
intervened, 
came 
to 
the 
throne 
by 
the 
death 
of 
Elizabeth 
on 
the 
24th 
of 
March, 
1603. 
Bacon 
was 
among 
the 
crowd 
of 
men 
who 
were 
made 
knights 
by 
James 
I., 
and 
he 
had 
to 
justify 
himself 
under 
the 
new 
order 
of 
things 
by 
writing 
“Sir 
Francis 
Bacon 
his 
Apologie 
in 
certain 
Imputations 
concerning 
the 
late 
Earle 
of 
Essex.” 
He 
was 
returned 
to 
the 
first 
Parliament 
of 
James 
I. 
by 
Ipswich 
and 
St. 
Albans, 
and 
he 
was 
confirmed 
in 
his 
office 
of 
King’s 
Counsel 
in 
August, 
1604; 
but 
he 
was 
not 
appointed 
to 
the 
office 
of 
Solicitor-General 
when 
it 
became 
vacant 
in 
that 
year. 


That 
was 
the 
position 
of 
Francis 
Bacon 
in 
1605, 
when 
he 
published 
this 
work, 
where 
in 
his 
First 
Book 
he 
pointed 
out 
the 
discredits 
of 
learning 
from 
human 
defects 
of 
the 
learned, 
and 
emptiness 
of 
many 
of 
the 
studies 
chosen, 
or 
the 
way 
of 
dealing 
with 
them. 
This 
came, 
he 
said, 
especially 
by 
the 
mistaking 
or 
misplacing 
of 
the 
last 
or 
furthest 
end 
of 
knowledge, 
as 
if 
there 
were 
sought 
in 
it 
“a 
couch 
whereupon 
to 
rest 
a 
searching 
and 
restless 
spirit; 
or 
a 
terrace 
for 
a 
wandering 
and 
variable 
mind 
to 
walk 
up 
and 
down 



with 
a 
fair 
prospect; 
or 
a 
tower 
of 
state 
for 
a 
proud 
mind 
to 
raise 
itself 
upon; 
or 
a 
fort 
or 
commanding 
ground 
for 
strife 
and 
contention; 
or 
a 
shop 
for 
profit 
or 
sale; 
and 
not 
a 
rich 
storehouse 
for 
the 
glory 
of 
the 
Creator 
and 
the 
relief 
of 
man’s 
estate.” 
The 
rest 
of 
the 
First 
Book 
was 
given 
to 
an 
argument 
upon 
the 
Dignity 
of 
Learning; 
and 
the 
Second 
Book, 
on 
the 
Advancement 
of 
Learning, 
is, 
as 
Bacon 
himself 
described 
it, 
“a 
general 
and 
faithful 
perambulation 
of 
learning, 
with 
an 
inquiry 
what 
parts 
thereof 
lie 
fresh 
and 
waste, 
and 
not 
improved 
and 
converted 
by 
the 
industry 
of 
man; 
to 
the 
end 
that 
such 
a 
plot 
made 
and 
recorded 
to 
memory 
may 
both 
minister 
light 
to 
any 
public 
designation 
and 
also 
serve 
to 
excite 
voluntary 
endeavours.” 
Bacon 
makes, 
by 
a 
sort 
of 
exhaustive 
analysis, 
a 
ground-plan 
of 
all 
subjects 
of 
study, 
as 
an 
intellectual 
map, 
helping 
the 
right 
inquirer 
in 
his 
search 
for 
the 
right 
path. 
The 
right 
path 
is 
that 
by 
which 
he 
has 
the 
best 
chance 
of 
adding 
to 
the 
stock 
of 
knowledge 
in 
the 
world 
something 
worth 
labouring 
for; 
and 
the 
true 
worth 
is 
in 
labour 
for 
“the 
glory 
of 
the 
Creator 
and 
the 
relief 
of 
man’s 
estate.”

The 
First 
Book 
of 
Francis 
Bacon; 
Of 
the 
Proficience 
and 
Advancement 
of 
Learning, 
Divine 
and 
Human. 


To 
the 
King. 


There 
were 
under 
the 
law, 
excellent 
King, 
both 
daily 
sacrifices 
and 
freewill 
offerings; 
the 
one 
proceeding 
upon 
ordinary 
observance, 
the 
other 
upon 
a 
devout 
cheerfulness: 
in 
like 
manner 
there 
belongeth 
to 
kings 
from 
their 
servants 
both 
tribute 
of 
duty 
and 
presents 
of 
affection. 
In 
the 
former 
of 
these 
I 
hope 
I 
shall 
not 
live 
to 
be 
wanting, 
according 
to 
my 
most 
humble 
duty 
and 
the 
good 
pleasure 
of 
your 
Majesty’s 
employments: 
for 
the 
latter, 
I 
thought 
it 
more 
respective 
to 
make 
choice 
of 
some 
oblation 
which 
might 
rather 
refer 
to 
the 
propriety 
and 
excellency 
of 
your 
individual 
person, 
than 
to 
the 
business 
of 
your 
crown 
and 
state. 


Wherefore, 
representing 
your 
Majesty 
many 
times 
unto 
my 
mind, 
and 
beholding 
you 
not 
with 
the 
inquisitive 
eye 
of 
presumption, 
to 
discover 
that 
which 
the 
Scripture 
telleth 
me 
is 
inscrutable, 
but 
with 
the 
observant 
eye 
of 
duty 
and 
admiration, 
leaving 
aside 
the 
other 
parts 
of 
your 
virtue 
and 
fortune, 
I 
have 
been 
touched 
— 
yea, 
and 
possessed 
— 
with 
an 
extreme 
wonder 
at 
those 
your 
virtues 
and 
faculties, 
which 
the 
philosophers 
call 
intellectual; 
the 
largeness 
of 
your 
capacity, 
the 
faithfulness 
of 
your 
memory, 
the 
swiftness 
of 
your 
apprehension, 
the 
penetration 
of 
your 
judgment, 
and 
the 
facility 
and 
order 
of 
your 
elocution: 
and 
I 
have 
often 
thought 
that 
of 
all 
the 
persons 
living 
that 
I 
have 
known, 
your 
Majesty 
were 
the 
best 
instance 
to 
make 
a 
man 
of 
Plato’s 
opinion, 
that 
all 
knowledge 
is 
but 
remembrance, 
and 
that 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
by 
Nature 
knoweth 
all 
things, 
and 
hath 
but 
her 
own 
native 
and 
original 
notions 
(which 
by 
the 
strangeness 
and 
darkness 
of 
this 
tabernacle 
of 
the 
body 
are 
sequestered) 
again 
revived 
and 
restored: 
such 
a 
light 
of 
Nature 
I 
have 
observed 
in 
your 
Majesty, 
and 
such 
a 
readiness 
to 
take 
flame 
and 
blaze 
from 
the 
least 
occasion 
presented, 
or 
the 
least 
spark 
of 
another’s 
knowledge 
delivered. 
And 
as 
the 
Scripture 
saith 
of 
the 
wisest 
king, 



“That 
his 
heart 
was 
as 
the 
sands 
of 
the 
sea;” 
which, 
though 
it 
be 
one 
of 
the 
largest 
bodies, 
yet 
it 
consisteth 
of 
the 
smallest 
and 
finest 
portions; 
so 
hath 
God 
given 
your 
Majesty 
a 
composition 
of 
understanding 
admirable, 
being 
able 
to 
compass 
and 
comprehend 
the 
greatest 
matters, 
and 
nevertheless 
to 
touch 
and 
apprehend 
the 
least; 
whereas 
it 
should 
seem 
an 
impossibility 
in 
Nature 
for 
the 
same 
instrument 
to 
make 
itself 
fit 
for 
great 
and 
small 
works. 
And 
for 
your 
gift 
of 
speech, 
I 
call 
to 
mind 
what 
Cornelius 
Tacitus 
saith 
of 
Augustus 
Caesar: 
Augusto 
profluens, 
et 
quae 
principem 
deceret, 
eloquentia 
fuit. 
For 
if 
we 
note 
it 
well, 
speech 
that 
is 
uttered 
with 
labour 
and 
difficulty, 
or 
speech 
that 
savoureth 
of 
the 
affectation 
of 
art 
and 
precepts, 
or 
speech 
that 
is 
framed 
after 
the 
imitation 
of 
some 
pattern 
of 
eloquence, 
though 
never 
so 
excellent; 
all 
this 
hath 
somewhat 
servile, 
and 
holding 
of 
the 
subject. 
But 
your 
Majesty’s 
manner 
of 
speech 
is, 
indeed, 
prince-like, 
flowing 
as 
from 
a 
fountain, 
and 
yet 
streaming 
and 
branching 
itself 
into 
Nature’s 
order, 
full 
of 
facility 
and 
felicity, 
imitating 
none, 
and 
inimitable 
by 
any. 
And 
as 
in 
your 
civil 
estate 
there 
appeareth 
to 
be 
an 
emulation 
and 
contention 
of 
your 
Majesty’s 
virtue 
with 
your 
fortune; 
a 
virtuous 
disposition 
with 
a 
fortunate 
regiment; 
a 
virtuous 
expectation 
(when 
time 
was) 
of 
your 
greater 
fortune, 
with 
a 
prosperous 
possession 
thereof 
in 
the 
due 
time; 
a 
virtuous 
observation 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
marriage, 
with 
most 
blessed 
and 
happy 
fruit 
of 
marriage; 
a 
virtuous 
and 
most 
Christian 
desire 
of 
peace, 
with 
a 
fortunate 
inclination 
in 
your 
neighbour 
princes 
thereunto: 
so 
likewise 
in 
these 
intellectual 
matters 
there 
seemeth 
to 
be 
no 
less 
contention 
between 
the 
excellency 
of 
your 
Majesty’s 
gifts 
of 
Nature 
and 
the 
universality 
and 
perfection 
of 
your 
learning. 
For 
I 
am 
well 
assured 
that 
this 
which 
I 
shall 
say 
is 
no 
amplification 
at 
all, 
but 
a 
positive 
and 
measured 
truth; 
which 
is, 
that 
there 
hath 
not 
been 
since 
Christ’s 
time 
any 
king 
or 
temporal 
monarch 
which 
hath 
been 
so 
learned 
in 
all 
literature 
and 
erudition, 
divine 
and 
human. 
For 
let 
a 
man 
seriously 
and 
diligently 
revolve 
and 
peruse 
the 
succession 
of 
the 
Emperors 
of 
Rome, 
of 
which 
Caesar 
the 
Dictator 
(who 
lived 
some 
years 
before 
Christ) 
and 
Marcus 
Antoninus 
were 
the 
best 
learned, 
and 
so 
descend 
to 
the 
Emperors 
of 
Graecia, 
or 
of 
the 
West, 
and 
then 
to 
the 
lines 
of 
France, 
Spain, 
England, 
Scotland, 
and 
the 
rest, 
and 
he 
shall 
find 
this 
judgment 
is 
truly 
made. 
For 
it 
seemeth 
much 
in 
a 
king 
if, 
by 
the 
compendious 
extractions 
of 
other 
men’s 
wits 
and 
labours, 
he 
can 
take 
hold 
of 
any 
superficial 
ornaments 
and 
shows 
of 
learning, 
or 
if 
he 
countenance 
and 
prefer 
learning 
and 
learned 
men; 
but 
to 
drink, 
indeed, 
of 
the 
true 
fountains 
of 
learning 
— 
nay, 
to 
have 
such 
a 
fountain 
of 
learning 
in 



himself, 
in 
a 
king, 
and 
in 
a 
king 
born 
— 
is 
almost 
a 
miracle. 
And 
the 
more, 
because 
there 
is 
met 
in 
your 
Majesty 
a 
rare 
conjunction, 
as 
well 
of 
divine 
and 
sacred 
literature 
as 
of 
profane 
and 
human; 
so 
as 
your 
Majesty 
standeth 
invested 
of 
that 
triplicity, 
which 
in 
great 
veneration 
was 
ascribed 
to 
the 
ancient 
Hermes: 
the 
power 
and 
fortune 
of 
a 
king, 
the 
knowledge 
and 
illumination 
of 
a 
priest, 
and 
the 
learning 
and 
universality 
of 
a 
philosopher. 
This 
propriety 
inherent 
and 
individual 
attribute 
in 
your 
Majesty 
deserveth 
to 
be 
expressed 
not 
only 
in 
the 
fame 
and 
admiration 
of 
the 
present 
time, 
nor 
in 
the 
history 
or 
tradition 
of 
the 
ages 
succeeding, 
but 
also 
in 
some 
solid 
work, 
fixed 
memorial, 
and 
immortal 
monument, 
bearing 
a 
character 
or 
signature 
both 
of 
the 
power 
of 
a 
king 
and 
the 
difference 
and 
perfection 
of 
such 
a 
king. 


Therefore 
I 
did 
conclude 
with 
myself 
that 
I 
could 
not 
make 
unto 
your 
Majesty 
a 
better 
oblation 
than 
of 
some 
treatise 
tending 
to 
that 
end, 
whereof 
the 
sum 
will 
consist 
of 
these 
two 
parts: 
the 
former 
concerning 
the 
excellency 
of 
learning 
and 
knowledge, 
and 
the 
excellency 
of 
the 
merit 
and 
true 
glory 
in 
the 
augmentation 
and 
propagation 
thereof; 
the 
latter, 
what 
the 
particular 
acts 
and 
works 
are 
which 
have 
been 
embraced 
and 
undertaken 
for 
the 
advancement 
of 
learning; 
and 
again, 
what 
defects 
and 
undervalues 
I 
find 
in 
such 
particular 
acts: 
to 
the 
end 
that 
though 
I 
cannot 
positively 
or 
affirmatively 
advise 
your 
Majesty, 
or 
propound 
unto 
you 
framed 
particulars, 
yet 
I 
may 
excite 
your 
princely 
cogitations 
to 
visit 
the 
excellent 
treasure 
of 
your 
own 
mind, 
and 
thence 
to 
extract 
particulars 
for 
this 
purpose 
agreeable 
to 
your 
magnanimity 
and 
wisdom. 



I 


(1) 
In 
the 
entrance 
to 
the 
former 
of 
these 
— 
to 
clear 
the 
way 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
to 
make 
silence, 
to 
have 
the 
true 
testimonies 
concerning 
the 
dignity 
of 
learning 
to 
be 
better 
heard, 
without 
the 
interruption 
of 
tacit 
objections 
— 
I 
think 
good 
to 
deliver 
it 
from 
the 
discredits 
and 
disgraces 
which 
it 
hath 
received, 
all 
from 
ignorance, 
but 
ignorance 
severally 
disguised; 
appearing 
sometimes 
in 
the 
zeal 
and 
jealousy 
of 
divines, 
sometimes 
in 
the 
severity 
and 
arrogancy 
of 
politics, 
and 
sometimes 
in 
the 
errors 
and 
imperfections 
of 
learned 
men 
themselves. 
(2) 
I 
hear 
the 
former 
sort 
say 
that 
knowledge 
is 
of 
those 
things 
which 
are 
to 
be 
accepted 
of 
with 
great 
limitation 
and 
caution; 
that 
the 
aspiring 
to 
overmuch 
knowledge 
was 
the 
original 
temptation 
and 
sin 
whereupon 
ensued 
the 
fall 
of 
man; 
that 
knowledge 
hath 
in 
it 
somewhat 
of 
the 
serpent, 
and, 
therefore, 
where 
it 
entereth 
into 
a 
man 
it 
makes 
him 
swell; 
Scientia 
inflat; 
that 
Solomon 
gives 
a 
censure, 
“That 
there 
is 
no 
end 
of 
making 
books, 
and 
that 
much 
reading 
is 
weariness 
of 
the 
flesh;” 
and 
again 
in 
another 
place, 
“That 
in 
spacious 
knowledge 
there 
is 
much 
contristation, 
and 
that 
he 
that 
increaseth 
knowledge 
increaseth 
anxiety;” 
that 
Saint 
Paul 
gives 
a 
caveat, 
“That 
we 
be 
not 
spoiled 
through 
vain 
philosophy;” 
that 
experience 
demonstrates 
how 
learned 
men 
have 
been 
arch-heretics, 
how 
learned 
times 
have 
been 
inclined 
to 
atheism, 
and 
how 
the 
contemplation 
of 
second 
causes 
doth 
derogate 
from 
our 
dependence 
upon 
God, 
who 
is 
the 
first 
cause. 
(3) 
To 
discover, 
then, 
the 
ignorance 
and 
error 
of 
this 
opinion, 
and 
the 
misunderstanding 
in 
the 
grounds 
thereof, 
it 
may 
well 
appear 
these 
men 
do 
not 
observe 
or 
consider 
that 
it 
was 
not 
the 
pure 
knowledge 
of 
Nature 
and 
universality, 
a 
knowledge 
by 
the 
light 
whereof 
man 
did 
give 
names 
unto 
other 
creatures 
in 
Paradise 
as 
they 
were 
brought 
before 
him 
according 
unto 
their 
proprieties, 
which 
gave 
the 
occasion 
to 
the 
fall; 
but 
it 
was 
the 
proud 
knowledge 
of 
good 
and 
evil, 
with 
an 
intent 
in 
man 
to 
give 
law 
unto 
himself, 
and 
to 
depend 
no 
more 
upon 
God’s 
commandments, 
which 
was 
the 
form 
of 
the 
temptation. 
Neither 
is 
it 
any 
quantity 
of 
knowledge, 
how 
great 
soever, 
that 
can 
make 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
to 
swell; 
for 
nothing 
can 
fill, 
much 
less 

extend 
the 
soul 
of 
man, 
but 
God 
and 
the 
contemplation 
of 
God; 
and, 
therefore, 
Solomon, 
speaking 
of 
the 
two 
principal 
senses 
of 
inquisition, 
the 
eye 
and 
the 
ear, 
affirmeth 
that 
the 
eye 
is 
never 
satisfied 
with 
seeing, 
nor 
the 
ear 
with 
hearing; 
and 
if 
there 
be 
no 
fulness, 
then 
is 
the 
continent 
greater 
than 
the 
content: 
so 
of 
knowledge 
itself 
and 
the 
mind 
of 
man, 
whereto 
the 
senses 
are 
but 
reporters, 
he 
defineth 
likewise 
in 
these 
words, 
placed 
after 
that 
calendar 
or 
ephemerides 
which 
he 
maketh 
of 
the 
diversities 
of 
times 
and 
seasons 
for 
all 
actions 
and 
purposes, 
and 
concludeth 
thus: 
“God 
hath 
made 
all 
things 
beautiful, 
or 
decent, 
in 
the 
true 
return 
of 
their 
seasons. 
Also 
He 
hath 
placed 
the 
world 
in 
man’s 
heart, 
yet 
cannot 
man 
find 
out 
the 
work 
which 
God 
worketh 
from 
the 
beginning 
to 
the 
end”— 
declaring 
not 
obscurely 
that 
God 
hath 
framed 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
as 
a 
mirror 
or 
glass, 
capable 
of 
the 
image 
of 
the 
universal 
world, 
and 
joyful 
to 
receive 
the 
impression 
thereof, 
as 
the 
eye 
joyeth 
to 
receive 
light; 
and 
not 
only 
delighted 
in 
beholding 
the 
variety 
of 
things 
and 
vicissitude 
of 
times, 
but 
raised 
also 
to 
find 
out 
and 
discern 
the 
ordinances 
and 
decrees 
which 
throughout 
all 
those 
changes 
are 
infallibly 
observed. 
And 
although 
he 
doth 
insinuate 
that 
the 
supreme 
or 
summary 
law 
of 
Nature 
(which 
he 
calleth 
“the 
work 
which 
God 
worketh 
from 
the 
beginning 
to 
the 
end”) 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
be 
found 
out 
by 
man, 
yet 
that 
doth 
not 
derogate 
from 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
mind; 
but 
may 
be 
referred 
to 
the 
impediments, 
as 
of 
shortness 
of 
life, 
ill 
conjunction 
of 
labours, 
ill 
tradition 
of 
knowledge 
over 
from 
hand 
to 
hand, 
and 
many 
other 
inconveniences, 
whereunto 
the 
condition 
of 
man 
is 
subject. 
For 
that 
nothing 
parcel 
of 
the 
world 
is 
denied 
to 
man’s 
inquiry 
and 
invention, 
he 
doth 
in 
another 
place 
rule 
over, 
when 
he 
saith, 
“The 
spirit 
of 
man 
is 
as 
the 
lamp 
of 
God, 
wherewith 
He 
searcheth 
the 
inwardness 
of 
all 
secrets.” 
If, 
then, 
such 
be 
the 
capacity 
and 
receipt 
of 
the 
mind 
of 
man, 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
there 
is 
no 
danger 
at 
all 
in 
the 
proportion 
or 
quantity 
of 
knowledge, 
how 
large 
soever, 
lest 
it 
should 
make 
it 
swell 
or 
out-compass 
itself; 
no, 
but 
it 
is 
merely 
the 
quality 
of 
knowledge, 
which, 
be 
it 
in 
quantity 
more 
or 
less, 
if 
it 
be 
taken 
without 
the 
true 
corrective 
thereof, 
hath 
in 
it 
some 
nature 
of 
venom 
or 
malignity, 
and 
some 
effects 
of 
that 
venom, 
which 
is 
ventosity 
or 
swelling. 
This 
corrective 
spice, 
the 
mixture 
whereof 
maketh 
knowledge 
so 
sovereign, 
is 
charity, 
which 
the 
Apostle 
immediately 
addeth 
to 
the 
former 
clause; 
for 
so 
he 
saith, 
“Knowledge 
bloweth 
up, 
but 
charity 
buildeth 
up;” 
not 
unlike 
unto 
that 
which 
he 
deilvereth 
in 
another 
place: 
“If 
I 
spake,” 
saith 
he, 
“with 
the 
tongues 
of 
men 
and 
angels, 
and 
had 
not 
charity, 
it 
were 
but 
as 
a 
tinkling 
cymbal.” 
Not 
but 
that 
it 
is 
an 



excellent 
thing 
to 
speak 
with 
the 
tongues 
of 
men 
and 
angels, 
but 
because, 
if 
it 
be 
severed 
from 
charity, 
and 
not 
referred 
to 
the 
good 
of 
men 
and 
mankind, 
it 
hath 
rather 
a 
sounding 
and 
unworthy 
glory 
than 
a 
meriting 
and 
substantial 
virtue. 
And 
as 
for 
that 
censure 
of 
Solomon 
concerning 
the 
excess 
of 
writing 
and 
reading 
books, 
and 
the 
anxiety 
of 
spirit 
which 
redoundeth 
from 
knowledge, 
and 
that 
admonition 
of 
St. 
Paul, 
“That 
we 
be 
not 
seduced 
by 
vain 
philosophy,” 
let 
those 
places 
be 
rightly 
understood; 
and 
they 
do, 
indeed, 
excellently 
set 
forth 
the 
true 
bounds 
and 
limitations 
whereby 
human 
knowledge 
is 
confined 
and 
circumscribed, 
and 
yet 
without 
any 
such 
contracting 
or 
coarctation, 
but 
that 
it 
may 
comprehend 
all 
the 
universal 
nature 
of 
things; 
for 
these 
limitations 
are 
three: 
the 
first, 
“That 
we 
do 
not 
so 
place 
our 
felicity 
in 
knowledge, 
as 
we 
forget 
our 
mortality;” 
the 
second, 
“That 
we 
make 
application 
of 
our 
knowledge, 
to 
give 
ourselves 
repose 
and 
contentment, 
and 
not 
distaste 
or 
repining;” 
the 
third, 
“That 
we 
do 
not 
presume 
by 
the 
contemplation 
of 
Nature 
to 
attain 
to 
the 
mysteries 
of 
God.” 
For 
as 
touching 
the 
first 
of 
these, 
Solomon 
doth 
excellently 
expound 
himself 
in 
another 
place 
of 
the 
same 
book, 
where 
he 
saith: 
“I 
saw 
well 
that 
knowledge 
recedeth 
as 
far 
from 
ignorance 
as 
light 
doth 
from 
darkness; 
and 
that 
the 
wise 
man’s 
eyes 
keep 
watch 
in 
his 
head, 
whereas 
this 
fool 
roundeth 
about 
in 
darkness: 
but 
withal 
I 
learned 
that 
the 
same 
mortality 
involveth 
them 
both.” 
And 
for 
the 
second, 
certain 
it 
is 
there 
is 
no 
vexation 
or 
anxiety 
of 
mind 
which 
resulteth 
from 
knowledge 
otherwise 
than 
merely 
by 
accident; 
for 
all 
knowledge 
and 
wonder 
(which 
is 
the 
seed 
of 
knowledge) 
is 
an 
impression 
of 
pleasure 
in 
itself; 
but 
when 
men 
fall 
to 
framing 
conclusions 
out 
of 
their 
knowledge, 
applying 
it 
to 
their 
particular, 
and 
ministering 
to 
themselves 
thereby 
weak 
fears 
or 
vast 
desires, 
there 
groweth 
that 
carefulness 
and 
trouble 
of 
mind 
which 
is 
spoken 
of; 
for 
then 
knowledge 
is 
no 
more 
Lumen 
siccum, 
whereof 
Heraclitus 
the 
profound 
said, 
Lumen 
siccum 
optima 
anima; 
but 
it 
becometh 
Lumen 
madidum, 
or 
maceratum, 
being 
steeped 
and 
infused 
in 
the 
humours 
of 
the 
affections. 
And 
as 
for 
the 
third 
point, 
it 
deserveth 
to 
be 
a 
little 
stood 
upon, 
and 
not 
to 
be 
lightly 
passed 
over; 
for 
if 
any 
man 
shall 
think 
by 
view 
and 
inquiry 
into 
these 
sensible 
and 
material 
things 
to 
attain 
that 
light, 
whereby 
he 
may 
reveal 
unto 
himself 
the 
nature 
or 
will 
of 
God, 
then, 
indeed, 
is 
he 
spoiled 
by 
vain 
philosophy; 
for 
the 
contemplation 
of 
God’s 
creatures 
and 
works 
produceth 
(having 
regard 
to 
the 
works 
and 
creatures 
themselves) 
knowledge, 
but 
having 
regard 
to 
God 
no 
perfect 
knowledge, 
but 
wonder, 
which 
is 
broken 
knowledge. 
And, 
therefore, 
it 
was 
most 
aptly 
said 
by 
one 
of 



Plato’s 
school, 
“That 
the 
sense 
of 
man 
carrieth 
a 
resemblance 
with 
the 
sun, 
which 
(as 
we 
see) 
openeth 
and 
revealeth 
all 
the 
terrestrial 
globe; 
but 
then, 
again, 
it 
obscureth 
and 
concealeth 
the 
stars 
and 
celestial 
globe: 
so 
doth 
the 
sense 
discover 
natural 
things, 
but 
it 
darkeneth 
and 
shutteth 
up 
divine.” 
And 
hence 
it 
is 
true 
that 
it 
hath 
proceeded, 
that 
divers 
great 
learned 
men 
have 
been 
heretical, 
whilst 
they 
have 
sought 
to 
fly 
up 
to 
the 
secrets 
of 
the 
Deity 
by 
this 
waxen 
wings 
of 
the 
senses. 
And 
as 
for 
the 
conceit 
that 
too 
much 
knowledge 
should 
incline 
a 
man 
to 
atheism, 
and 
that 
the 
ignorance 
of 
second 
causes 
should 
make 
a 
more 
devout 
dependence 
upon 
God, 
which 
is 
the 
first 
cause; 
first, 
it 
is 
good 
to 
ask 
the 
question 
which 
Job 
asked 
of 
his 
friends: 
“Will 
you 
lie 
for 
God, 
as 
one 
man 
will 
lie 
for 
another, 
to 
gratify 
him?” 
For 
certain 
it 
is 
that 
God 
worketh 
nothing 
in 
Nature 
but 
by 
second 
causes; 
and 
if 
they 
would 
have 
it 
otherwise 
believed, 
it 
is 
mere 
imposture, 
as 
it 
were 
in 
favour 
towards 
God, 
and 
nothing 
else 
but 
to 
offer 
to 
the 
Author 
of 
truth 
the 
unclean 
sacrifice 
of 
a 
lie. 
But 
further, 
it 
is 
an 
assured 
truth, 
and 
a 
conclusion 
of 
experience, 
that 
a 
little 
or 
superficial 
knowledge 
of 
philosophy 
may 
incline 
the 
mind 
of 
men 
to 
atheism, 
but 
a 
further 
proceeding 
therein 
doth 
bring 
the 
mind 
back 
again 
to 
religion. 
For 
in 
the 
entrance 
of 
philosophy, 
when 
the 
second 
causes, 
which 
are 
next 
unto 
the 
senses, 
do 
offer 
themselves 
to 
the 
mind 
of 
man, 
if 
it 
dwell 
and 
stay 
there 
it 
may 
induce 
some 
oblivion 
of 
the 
highest 
cause; 
but 
when 
a 
man 
passeth 
on 
further 
and 
seeth 
the 
dependence 
of 
causes 
and 
the 
works 
of 
Providence; 
then, 
according 
to 
the 
allegory 
of 
the 
poets, 
he 
will 
easily 
believe 
that 
the 
highest 
link 
of 
Nature’s 
chain 
must 
needs 
he 
tied 
to 
the 
foot 
of 
Jupiter’s 
chair. 
To 
conclude, 
therefore, 
let 
no 
man 
upon 
a 
weak 
conceit 
of 
sobriety 
or 
an 
ill-applied 
moderation 
think 
or 
maintain 
that 
a 
man 
can 
search 
too 
far, 
or 
be 
too 
well 
studied 
in 
the 
book 
of 
God’s 
word, 
or 
in 
the 
book 
of 
God’s 
works, 
divinity 
or 
philosophy; 
but 
rather 
let 
men 
endeavour 
an 
endless 
progress 
or 
proficience 
in 
both; 
only 
let 
men 
beware 
that 
they 
apply 
both 
to 
charity, 
and 
not 
to 
swelling; 
to 
use, 
and 
not 
to 
ostentation; 
and 
again, 
that 
they 
do 
not 
unwisely 
mingle 
or 
confound 
these 
learnings 
together. 



II 


(1) 
And 
as 
for 
the 
disgraces 
which 
learning 
receiveth 
from 
politics, 
they 
be 
of 
this 
nature: 
that 
learning 
doth 
soften 
men’s 
minds, 
and 
makes 
them 
more 
unapt 
for 
the 
honour 
and 
exercise 
of 
arms; 
that 
it 
doth 
mar 
and 
pervert 
men’s 
dispositions 
for 
matter 
of 
government 
and 
policy, 
in 
making 
them 
too 
curious 
and 
irresolute 
by 
variety 
of 
reading, 
or 
too 
peremptory 
or 
positive 
by 
strictness 
of 
rules 
and 
axioms, 
or 
too 
immoderate 
and 
overweening 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
greatness 
of 
examples, 
or 
too 
incompatible 
and 
differing 
from 
the 
times 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
dissimilitude 
of 
examples; 
or 
at 
least, 
that 
it 
doth 
divert 
men’s 
travails 
from 
action 
and 
business, 
and 
bringeth 
them 
to 
a 
love 
of 
leisure 
and 
privateness; 
and 
that 
it 
doth 
bring 
into 
states 
a 
relaxation 
of 
discipline, 
whilst 
every 
man 
is 
more 
ready 
to 
argue 
than 
to 
obey 
and 
execute. 
Out 
of 
this 
conceit 
Cato, 
surnamed 
the 
Censor, 
one 
of 
the 
wisest 
men 
indeed 
that 
ever 
lived, 
when 
Carneades 
the 
philosopher 
came 
in 
embassage 
to 
Rome, 
and 
that 
the 
young 
men 
of 
Rome 
began 
to 
flock 
about 
him, 
being 
allured 
with 
the 
sweetness 
and 
majesty 
of 
his 
eloquence 
and 
learning, 
gave 
counsel 
in 
open 
senate 
that 
they 
should 
give 
him 
his 
despatch 
with 
all 
speed, 
lest 
he 
should 
infect 
and 
enchant 
the 
minds 
and 
affections 
of 
the 
youth, 
and 
at 
unawares 
bring 
in 
an 
alteration 
of 
the 
manners 
and 
customs 
of 
the 
state. 
Out 
of 
the 
same 
conceit 
or 
humour 
did 
Virgil, 
turning 
his 
pen 
to 
the 
advantage 
of 
his 
country 
and 
the 
disadvantage 
of 
his 
own 
profession, 
make 
a 
kind 
of 
separation 
between 
policy 
and 
government, 
and 
between 
arts 
and 
sciences, 
in 
the 
verses 
so 
much 
renowned, 
attributing 
and 
challenging 
the 
one 
to 
the 
Romans, 
and 
leaving 
and 
yielding 
the 
other 
to 
the 
Grecians: 
Tu 
regere 
imperio 
popules, 
Romane, 
memento, 
Hae 
tibi 
erunt 
artes, 
&c. 
So 
likewise 
we 
see 
that 
Anytus, 
the 
accuser 
of 
Socrates, 
laid 
it 
as 
an 
article 
of 
charge 
and 
accusation 
against 
him, 
that 
he 
did, 
with 
the 
variety 
and 
power 
of 
his 
discourses 
and 
disputatious, 
withdraw 
young 
men 
from 
due 
reverence 
to 
the 
laws 
and 
customs 
of 
their 
country, 
and 
that 
he 
did 
profess 
a 
dangerous 
and 
pernicious 
science, 
which 
was 
to 
make 
the 
worse 
matter 
seem 
the 
better, 
and 
to 
suppress 
truth 
by 
force 
of 
eloquence 
and 
speech. 
(2) 
But 
these 
and 
the 
like 
imputations 
have 
rather 
a 
countenance 
of 
gravity 
than 
any 
ground 
of 
justice: 
for 
experience 
doth 
warrant 
that, 
both 
in 

persons 
and 
in 
times, 
there 
hath 
been 
a 
meeting 
and 
concurrence 
in 
learning 
and 
arms, 
flourishing 
and 
excelling 
in 
the 
same 
men 
and 
the 
same 
ages. 
For 
as 
‘for 
men, 
there 
cannot 
be 
a 
better 
nor 
the 
hike 
instance 
as 
of 
that 
pair, 
Alexander 
the 
Great 
and 
Julius 
Caesar, 
the 
Dictator; 
whereof 
the 
one 
was 
Aristotle’s 
scholar 
in 
philosophy, 
and 
the 
other 
was 
Cicero’s 
rival 
in 
eloquence; 
or 
if 
any 
man 
had 
rather 
call 
for 
scholars 
that 
were 
great 
generals, 
than 
generals 
that 
were 
great 
scholars, 
let 
him 
take 
Epaminondas 
the 
Theban, 
or 
Xenophon 
the 
Athenian; 
whereof 
the 
one 
was 
the 
first 
that 
abated 
the 
power 
of 
Sparta, 
and 
the 
other 
was 
the 
first 
that 
made 
way 
to 
the 
overthrow 
of 
the 
monarchy 
of 
Persia. 
And 
this 
concurrence 
is 
yet 
more 
visible 
in 
times 
than 
in 
persons, 
by 
how 
much 
an 
age 
is 
greater 
object 
than 
a 
man. 
For 
both 
in 
Egypt, 
Assyria, 
Persia, 
Graecia, 
and 
Rome, 
the 
same 
times 
that 
are 
most 
renowned 
for 
arms 
are, 
likewise, 
most 
admired 
for 
learning, 
so 
that 
the 
greatest 
authors 
and 
philosophers, 
and 
the 
greatest 
captains 
and 
governors, 
have 
lived 
in 
the 
same 
ages. 
Neither 
can 
it 
otherwise 
he: 
for 
as 
in 
man 
the 
ripeness 
of 
strength 
of 
the 
body 
and 
mind 
cometh 
much 
about 
an 
age, 
save 
that 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
body 
cometh 
somewhat 
the 
more 
early, 
so 
in 
states, 
arms 
and 
learning, 
whereof 
the 
one 
correspondeth 
to 
the 
body, 
the 
other 
to 
the 
soul 
of 
man, 
have 
a 
concurrence 
or 
near 
sequence 
in 
times. 


(3) 
And 
for 
matter 
of 
policy 
and 
government, 
that 
learning, 
should 
rather 
hurt, 
than 
enable 
thereunto, 
is 
a 
thing 
very 
improbable; 
we 
see 
it 
is 
accounted 
an 
error 
to 
commit 
a 
natural 
body 
to 
empiric 
physicians, 
which 
commonly 
have 
a 
few 
pleasing 
receipts 
whereupon 
they 
are 
confident 
and 
adventurous, 
but 
know 
neither 
the 
causes 
of 
diseases, 
nor 
the 
complexions 
of 
patients, 
nor 
peril 
of 
accidents, 
nor 
the 
true 
method 
of 
cures; 
we 
see 
it 
is 
a 
like 
error 
to 
rely 
upon 
advocates 
or 
lawyers 
which 
are 
only 
men 
of 
practice, 
and 
not 
grounded 
in 
their 
books, 
who 
are 
many 
times 
easily 
surprised 
when 
matter 
falleth 
out 
besides 
their 
experience, 
to 
the 
prejudice 
of 
the 
causes 
they 
handle: 
so 
by 
like 
reason 
it 
cannot 
be 
but 
a 
matter 
of 
doubtful 
consequence 
if 
states 
be 
managed 
by 
empiric 
statesmen, 
not 
well 
mingled 
with 
men 
grounded 
in 
learning. 
But 
contrariwise, 
it 
is 
almost 
without 
instance 
contradictory 
that 
ever 
any 
government 
was 
disastrous 
that 
was 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
learned 
governors. 
For 
howsoever 
it 
hath 
been 
ordinary 
with 
politic 
men 
to 
extenuate 
and 
disable 
learned 
men 
by 
the 
names 
of 
pedantes; 
yet 
in 
the 
records 
of 
time 
it 
appeareth 
in 
many 
particulars 
that 
the 
governments 
of 
princes 
in 
minority 
(notwithstanding 
the 
infinite 
disadvantage 
of 
that 
kind 
of 
state)— 
have 
nevertheless 
excelled 
the 
government 
of 
princes 
of 
mature 
age, 

even 
for 
that 
reason 
which 
they 
seek 
to 
traduce, 
which 
is 
that 
by 
that 
occasion 
the 
state 
hath 
been 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
pedantes: 
for 
so 
was 
the 
state 
of 
Rome 
for 
the 
first 
five 
years, 
which 
are 
so 
much 
magnified, 
during 
the 
minority 
of 
Nero, 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
Seneca, 
a 
pedenti; 
so 
it 
was 
again, 
for 
ten 
years’ 
space 
or 
more, 
during 
the 
minority 
of 
Gordianus 
the 
younger, 
with 
great 
applause 
and 
contentation 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
Misitheus, 
a 
pedanti: 
so 
was 
it 
before 
that, 
in 
the 
minority 
of 
Alexander 
Severus, 
in 
like 
happiness, 
in 
hands 
not 
much 
unlike, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
rule 
of 
the 
women, 
who 
were 
aided 
by 
the 
teachers 
and 
preceptors. 
Nay, 
let 
a 
man 
look 
into 
the 
government 
of 
the 
Bishops 
of 
Rome, 
as 
by 
name, 
into 
the 
government 
of 
Pius 
Quintus 
and 
Sextus 
Quintus 
in 
our 
times, 
who 
were 
both 
at 
their 
entrance 
esteemed 
but 
as 
pedantical 
friars, 
and 
he 
shall 
find 
that 
such 
Popes 
do 
greater 
things, 
and 
proceed 
upon 
truer 
principles 
of 
state, 
than 
those 
which 
have 
ascended 
to 
the 
papacy 
from 
an 
education 
and 
breeding 
in 
affairs 
of 
state 
and 
courts 
of 
princes; 
for 
although 
men 
bred 
in 
learning 
are 
perhaps 
to 
seek 
in 
points 
of 
convenience 
and 
accommodating 
for 
the 
present, 
which 
the 
Italians 
call 
ragioni 
di 
stato, 
whereof 
the 
same 
Pius 
Quintus 
could 
not 
hear 
spoken 
with 
patience, 
terming 
them 
inventions 
against 
religion 
and 
the 
moral 
virtues; 
yet 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
to 
recompense 
that, 
they 
are 
perfect 
in 
those 
same 
plain 
grounds 
of 
religion, 
justice, 
honour, 
and 
moral 
virtue, 
which 
if 
they 
be 
well 
and 
watchfully 
pursued, 
there 
will 
be 
seldom 
use 
of 
those 
other, 
no 
more 
than 
of 
physic 
in 
a 
sound 
or 
well-dieted 
body. 
Neither 
can 
the 
experience 
of 
one 
man’s 
life 
furnish 
examples 
and 
precedents 
for 
the 
event 
of 
one 
man’s 
life. 
For 
as 
it 
happeneth 
sometimes 
that 
the 
grandchild, 
or 
other 
descendant, 
resembleth 
the 
ancestor 
more 
than 
the 
son; 
so 
many 
times 
occurrences 
of 
present 
times 
may 
sort 
better 
with 
ancient 
examples 
than 
with 
those 
of 
the 
later 
or 
immediate 
times; 
and 
lastly, 
the 
wit 
of 
one 
man 
can 
no 
more 
countervail 
learning 
than 
one 
man’s 
means 
can 
hold 
way 
with 
a 
common 
purse. 


(4) 
And 
as 
for 
those 
particular 
seducements 
or 
indispositions 
of 
the 
mind 
for 
policy 
and 
government, 
which 
learning 
is 
pretended 
to 
insinuate; 
if 
it 
be 
granted 
that 
any 
such 
thing 
be, 
it 
must 
be 
remembered 
withal 
that 
learning 
ministereth 
in 
every 
of 
them 
greater 
strength 
of 
medicine 
or 
remedy 
than 
it 
offereth 
cause 
of 
indisposition 
or 
infirmity. 
For 
if 
by 
a 
secret 
operation 
it 
make 
men 
perplexed 
and 
irresolute, 
on 
the 
other 
side 
by 
plain 
precept 
it 
teacheth 
them 
when 
and 
upon 
what 
ground 
to 
resolve; 
yea, 
and 
how 
to 
carry 
things 
in 
suspense, 
without 
prejudice, 
till 
they 
resolve. 
If 
it 
make 
men 
positive 
and 
regular, 
it 
teacheth 
them 
what 
things 
are 
in 
their 
nature 

demonstrative, 
and 
what 
are 
conjectural, 
and 
as 
well 
the 
use 
of 
distinctions 
and 
exceptions, 
as 
the 
latitude 
of 
principles 
and 
rules. 
If 
it 
mislead 
by 
disproportion 
or 
dissimilitude 
of 
examples, 
it 
teacheth 
men 
the 
force 
of 
circumstances, 
the 
errors 
of 
comparisons, 
and 
all 
the 
cautions 
of 
application; 
so 
that 
in 
all 
these 
it 
doth 
rectify 
more 
effectually 
than 
it 
can 
pervert. 
And 
these 
medicines 
it 
conveyeth 
into 
men’s 
minds 
much 
more 
forcibly 
by 
the 
quickness 
and 
penetration 
of 
examples. 
For 
let 
a 
man 
look 
into 
the 
errors 
of 
Clement 
VII., 
so 
lively 
described 
by 
Guicciardini, 
who 
served 
under 
him, 
or 
into 
the 
errors 
of 
Cicero, 
painted 
out 
by 
his 
own 
pencil 
in 
his 
Epistles 
to 
Atticus, 
and 
he 
will 
fly 
apace 
from 
being 
irresolute. 
Let 
him 
look 
into 
the 
errors 
of 
Phocion, 
and 
he 
will 
beware 
how 
he 
be 
obstinate 
or 
inflexible. 
Let 
him 
but 
read 
the 
fable 
of 
Ixion, 
and 
it 
will 
hold 
him 
from 
being 
vaporous 
or 
imaginative. 
Let 
him 
look 
into 
the 
errors 
of 
Cato 
II., 
and 
he 
will 
never 
be 
one 
of 
the 
Antipodes, 
to 
tread 
opposite 
to 
the 
present 
world. 


(5) 
And 
for 
the 
conceit 
that 
learning 
should 
dispose 
men 
to 
leisure 
and 
privateness, 
and 
make 
men 
slothful: 
it 
were 
a 
strange 
thing 
if 
that 
which 
accustometh 
the 
mind 
to 
a 
perpetual 
motion 
and 
agitation 
should 
induce 
slothfulness, 
whereas, 
contrariwise, 
it 
may 
be 
truly 
affirmed 
that 
no 
kind 
of 
men 
love 
business 
for 
itself 
but 
those 
that 
are 
learned; 
for 
other 
persons 
love 
it 
for 
profit, 
as 
a 
hireling 
that 
loves 
the 
work 
for 
the 
wages; 
or 
for 
honour, 
as 
because 
it 
beareth 
them 
up 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
men, 
and 
refresheth 
their 
reputation, 
which 
otherwise 
would 
wear; 
or 
because 
it 
putteth 
them 
in 
mind 
of 
their 
fortune, 
and 
giveth 
them 
occasion 
to 
pleasure 
and 
displeasure; 
or 
because 
it 
exerciseth 
some 
faculty 
wherein 
they 
take 
pride, 
and 
so 
entertaineth 
them 
in 
good-humour 
and 
pleasing 
conceits 
towards 
themselves; 
or 
because 
it 
advanceth 
any 
other 
their 
ends. 
So 
that 
as 
it 
is 
said 
of 
untrue 
valours, 
that 
some 
men’s 
valours 
are 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
them 
that 
look 
on, 
so 
such 
men’s 
industries 
are 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
others, 
or, 
at 
least, 
in 
regard 
of 
their 
own 
designments; 
only 
learned 
men 
love 
business 
as 
an 
action 
according 
to 
nature, 
as 
agreeable 
to 
health 
of 
mind 
as 
exercise 
is 
to 
health 
of 
body, 
taking 
pleasure 
in 
the 
action 
itself, 
and 
not 
in 
the 
purchase, 
so 
that 
of 
all 
men 
they 
are 
the 
most 
indefatigable, 
if 
it 
be 
towards 
any 
business 
which 
can 
hold 
or 
detain 
their 
mind. 
(6) 
And 
if 
any 
man 
be 
laborious 
in 
reading 
and 
study, 
and 
yet 
idle 
in 
business 
and 
action, 
it 
groweth 
from 
some 
weakness 
of 
body 
or 
softness 
of 
spirit, 
such 
as 
Seneca 
speaketh 
of: 
Quidam 
tam 
sunt 
umbratiles, 
ut 
putent 
in 

turbido 
esse 
quicquid 
in 
luce 
est; 
and 
not 
of 
learning: 
well 
may 
it 
be 
that 
such 
a 
point 
of 
a 
man’s 
nature 
may 
make 
him 
give 
himself 
to 
learning, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
learning 
that 
breedeth 
any 
such 
point 
in 
his 
nature. 


(7) 
And 
that 
learning 
should 
take 
up 
too 
much 
time 
or 
leisure: 
I 
answer, 
the 
most 
active 
or 
busy 
man 
that 
hath 
been 
or 
can 
be, 
hath 
(no 
question) 
many 
vacant 
times 
of 
leisure 
while 
he 
expecteth 
the 
tides 
and 
returns 
of 
business 
(except 
he 
be 
either 
tedious 
and 
of 
no 
despatch, 
or 
lightly 
and 
unworthily 
ambitious 
to 
meddle 
in 
things 
that 
may 
be 
better 
done 
by 
others), 
and 
then 
the 
question 
is 
but 
how 
those 
spaces 
and 
times 
of 
leisure 
shall 
be 
filled 
and 
spent; 
whether 
in 
pleasure 
or 
in 
studies; 
as 
was 
well 
answered 
by 
Demosthenes 
to 
his 
adversary 
AEschines, 
that 
was 
a 
man 
given 
to 
pleasure, 
and 
told 
him 
“That 
his 
orations 
did 
smell 
of 
the 
lamp.” 
“Indeed,” 
said 
Demosthenes, 
“there 
is 
a 
great 
difference 
between 
the 
things 
that 
you 
and 
I 
do 
by 
lamp-light.” 
So 
as 
no 
man 
need 
doubt 
that 
learning 
will 
expel 
business, 
but 
rather 
it 
will 
keep 
and 
defend 
the 
possession 
of 
the 
mind 
against 
idleness 
and 
pleasure, 
which 
otherwise 
at 
unawares 
may 
enter 
to 
the 
prejudice 
of 
both. 
(8) 
Again, 
for 
that 
other 
conceit 
that 
learning 
should 
undermine 
the 
reverence 
of 
laws 
and 
government, 
it 
is 
assuredly 
a 
mere 
depravation 
and 
calumny, 
without 
all 
shadow 
of 
truth. 
For 
to 
say 
that 
a 
blind 
custom 
of 
obedience 
should 
be 
a 
surer 
obligation 
than 
duty 
taught 
and 
understood, 
it 
is 
to 
affirm 
that 
a 
blind 
man 
may 
tread 
surer 
by 
a 
guide 
than 
a 
seeing 
man 
can 
by 
a 
light. 
And 
it 
is 
without 
all 
controversy 
that 
learning 
doth 
make 
the 
minds 
of 
men 
gentle, 
generous, 
manageable, 
and 
pliant 
to 
government; 
whereas 
ignorance 
makes 
them 
churlish, 
thwart, 
and 
mutinous: 
and 
the 
evidence 
of 
time 
doth 
clear 
this 
assertion, 
considering 
that 
the 
most 
barbarous, 
rude, 
and 
unlearned 
times 
have 
been 
most 
subject 
to 
tumults, 
seditious, 
and 
changes. 
(9) 
And 
as 
to 
the 
judgment 
of 
Cato 
the 
Censor, 
he 
was 
well 
punished 
for 
his 
blasphemy 
against 
learning, 
in 
the 
same 
kind 
wherein 
he 
offended; 
for 
when 
he 
was 
past 
threescore 
years 
old, 
he 
was 
taken 
with 
an 
extreme 
desire 
to 
go 
to 
school 
again, 
and 
to 
learn 
the 
Greek 
tongue, 
to 
the 
end 
to 
peruse 
the 
Greek 
authors; 
which 
doth 
well 
demonstrate 
that 
his 
former 
censure 
of 
the 
Grecian 
learning 
was 
rather 
an 
affected 
gravity, 
than 
according 
to 
the 
inward 
sense 
of 
his 
own 
opinion. 
And 
as 
for 
Virgil’s 
verses, 
though 
it 
pleased 
him 
to 
brave 
the 
world 
in 
taking 
to 
the 
Romans 
the 
art 
of 
empire, 
and 
leaving 
to 
others 
the 
arts 
of 
subjects, 
yet 
so 
much 
is 
manifest 
— 
that 
the 
Romans 
never 

ascended 
to 
that 
height 
of 
empire 
till 
the 
time 
they 
had 
ascended 
to 
the 
height 
of 
other 
arts. 
For 
in 
the 
time 
of 
the 
two 
first 
Caesars, 
which 
had 
the 
art 
of 
government 
in 
greatest 
perfection, 
there 
lived 
the 
best 
poet, 
Virgilius 
Maro; 
the 
best 
historiographer, 
Titus 
Livius; 
the 
best 
antiquary, 
Marcus 
Varro; 
and 
the 
best 
or 
second 
orator, 
Marcus 
Cicero, 
that 
to 
the 
memory 
of 
man 
are 
known. 
As 
for 
the 
accusation 
of 
Socrates, 
the 
time 
must 
be 
remembered 
when 
it 
was 
prosecuted; 
which 
was 
under 
the 
Thirty 
Tyrants, 
the 
most 
base, 
bloody, 
and 
envious 
persons 
that 
have 
governed; 
which 
revolution 
of 
state 
was 
no 
sooner 
over 
but 
Socrates, 
whom 
they 
had 
made 
a 
person 
criminal, 
was 
made 
a 
person 
heroical, 
and 
his 
memory 
accumulate 
with 
honours 
divine 
and 
human; 
and 
those 
discourses 
of 
his 
which 
were 
then 
termed 
corrupting 
of 
manners, 
were 
after 
acknowledged 
for 
sovereign 
medicines 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
manners, 
and 
so 
have 
been 
received 
ever 
since 
till 
this 
day. 
Let 
this, 
therefore, 
serve 
for 
answer 
to 
politiques, 
which 
in 
their 
humorous 
severity, 
or 
in 
their 
feigned 
gravity, 
have 
presumed 
to 
throw 
imputations 
upon 
learning; 
which 
redargution 
nevertheless 
(save 
that 
we 
know 
not 
whether 
our 
labours 
may 
extend 
to 
other 
ages) 
were 
not 
needful 
for 
the 
present, 
in 
regard 
of 
the 
love 
and 
reverence 
towards 
learning 
which 
the 
example 
and 
countenance 
of 
two 
so 
learned 
princes, 
Queen 
Elizabeth 
and 
your 
Majesty, 
being 
as 
Castor 
and 
Pollux, 
lucida 
sidera, 
stars 
of 
excellent 
light 
and 
most 
benign 
influence, 
hath 
wrought 
in 
all 
men 
of 
place 
and 
authority 
in 
our 
nation. 



III 


(1) 
Now 
therefore 
we 
come 
to 
that 
third 
sort 
of 
discredit 
or 
diminution 
of 
credit 
that 
groweth 
unto 
learning 
from 
learned 
men 
themselves, 
which 
commonly 
cleaveth 
fastest: 
it 
is 
either 
from 
their 
fortune, 
or 
from 
their 
manners, 
or 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
their 
studies. 
For 
the 
first, 
it 
is 
not 
in 
their 
power; 
and 
the 
second 
is 
accidental; 
the 
third 
only 
is 
proper 
to 
be 
handled: 
but 
because 
we 
are 
not 
in 
hand 
with 
true 
measure, 
but 
with 
popular 
estimation 
and 
conceit, 
it 
is 
not 
amiss 
to 
speak 
somewhat 
of 
the 
two 
former. 
The 
derogations 
therefore 
which 
grow 
to 
learning 
from 
the 
fortune 
or 
condition 
of 
learned 
men, 
are 
either 
in 
respect 
of 
scarcity 
of 
means, 
or 
in 
respect 
of 
privateness 
of 
life 
and 
meanness 
of 
employments. 
(2) 
Concerning 
want, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
the 
case 
of 
learned 
men 
usually 
to 
begin 
with 
little, 
and 
not 
to 
grow 
rich 
so 
fast 
as 
other 
men, 
by 
reason 
they 
convert 
not 
their 
labours 
chiefly 
to 
lucre 
and 
increase, 
it 
were 
good 
to 
leave 
the 
commonplace 
in 
commendation 
of 
povery 
to 
some 
friar 
to 
handle, 
to 
whom 
much 
was 
attributed 
by 
Machiavel 
in 
this 
point 
when 
he 
said, 
“That 
the 
kingdom 
of 
the 
clergy 
had 
been 
long 
before 
at 
an 
end, 
if 
the 
reputation 
and 
reverence 
towards 
the 
poverty 
of 
friars 
had 
not 
borne 
out 
the 
scandal 
of 
the 
superfluities 
and 
excesses 
of 
bishops 
and 
prelates.” 
So 
a 
man 
might 
say 
that 
the 
felicity 
and 
delicacy 
of 
princes 
and 
great 
persons 
had 
long 
since 
turned 
to 
rudeness 
and 
barbarism, 
if 
the 
poverty 
of 
learning 
had 
not 
kept 
up 
civility 
and 
honour 
of 
life; 
but 
without 
any 
such 
advantages, 
it 
is 
worthy 
the 
observation 
what 
a 
reverent 
and 
honoured 
thing 
poverty 
of 
fortune 
was 
for 
some 
ages 
in 
the 
Roman 
state, 
which 
nevertheless 
was 
a 
state 
without 
paradoxes. 
For 
we 
see 
what 
Titus 
Livius 
saith 
in 
his 
introduction: 
Caeterum 
aut 
me 
amor 
negotii 
suscepti 
fallit 
aut 
nulla 
unquam 
respublica 
nec 
major, 
nec 
sanctior, 
nec 
bonis 
exemplis 
ditior 
fuit; 
nec 
in 
quam 
tam 
sero 
avaritia 
luxuriaque 
immigraverint; 
nec 
ubi 
tantus 
ac 
tam 
diu 
paupertati 
ac 
parsimoniae 
honos 
fuerit. 
We 
see 
likewise, 
after 
that 
the 
state 
of 
Rome 
was 
not 
itself, 
but 
did 
degenerate, 
how 
that 
person 
that 
took 
upon 
him 
to 
be 
counsellor 
to 
Julius 
Caesar 
after 
his 
victory 
where 
to 
begin 
his 
restoration 
of 
the 
state, 
maketh 
it 
of 
all 
points 
the 
most 
summary 
to 
take 
away 
the 
estimation 
of 
wealth: 
Verum 
haec 
et 
omnia 
mala 
pariter 
cum 
honore 
pecuniae 

desinent; 
si 
neque 
magistratus, 
neque 
alia 
vulgo 
cupienda, 
venalia 
erunt. 
To 
conclude 
this 
point: 
as 
it 
was 
truly 
said 
that 
Paupertas 
est 
virtutis 
fortuna, 
though 
sometimes 
it 
come 
from 
vice, 
so 
it 
may 
be 
fitly 
said 
that, 
though 
some 
times 
it 
may 
proceed 
from 
misgovernment 
and 
accident. 
Surely 
Solomon 
hath 
pronounced 
it 
both 
in 
censure, 
Qui 
festinat 
ad 
divitias 
non 
erit 
insons; 
and 
in 
precept, 
“Buy 
the 
truth, 
and 
sell 
it 
not; 
and 
so 
of 
wisdom 
and 
knowledge;” 
judging 
that 
means 
were 
to 
be 
spent 
upon 
learning, 
and 
not 
learning 
to 
be 
applied 
to 
means. 
And 
as 
for 
the 
privateness 
or 
obscureness 
(as 
it 
may 
be 
in 
vulgar 
estimation 
accounted) 
of 
life 
of 
contemplative 
men, 
it 
is 
a 
theme 
so 
common 
to 
extol 
a 
private 
life, 
not 
taxed 
with 
sensuality 
and 
sloth, 
in 
comparison 
and 
to 
the 
disadvantage 
of 
a 
civil 
life, 
for 
safety, 
liberty, 
pleasure, 
and 
dignity, 
or 
at 
least 
freedom 
from 
indignity, 
as 
no 
man 
handleth 
it 
but 
handleth 
it 
well; 
such 
a 
consonancy 
it 
hath 
to 
men’s 
conceits 
in 
the 
expressing, 
and 
to 
men’s 
consents 
in 
the 
allowing. 
This 
only 
I 
will 
add, 
that 
learned 
men 
forgotten 
in 
states 
and 
not 
living 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
men, 
are 
like 
the 
images 
of 
Cassius 
and 
Brutus 
in 
the 
funeral 
of 
Junia, 
of 
which, 
not 
being 
represented 
as 
many 
others 
were, 
Tacitus 
saith, 
Eo 
ipso 
praefulgebant 
quod 
non 
visebantur. 


(3) 
And 
for 
meanness 
of 
employment, 
that 
which 
is 
most 
traduced 
to 
contempt 
is 
that 
the 
government 
of 
youth 
is 
commonly 
allotted 
to 
them; 
which 
age, 
because 
it 
is 
the 
age 
of 
least 
authority, 
it 
is 
transferred 
to 
the 
disesteeming 
of 
those 
employments 
wherein 
youth 
is 
conversant, 
and 
which 
are 
conversant 
about 
youth. 
But 
how 
unjust 
this 
traducement 
is 
(if 
you 
will 
reduce 
things 
from 
popularity 
of 
opinion 
to 
measure 
of 
reason) 
may 
appear 
in 
that 
we 
see 
men 
are 
more 
curious 
what 
they 
put 
into 
a 
new 
vessel 
than 
into 
a 
vessel 
seasoned; 
and 
what 
mould 
they 
lay 
about 
a 
young 
plant 
than 
about 
a 
plant 
corroborate; 
so 
as 
this 
weakest 
terms 
and 
times 
of 
all 
things 
use 
to 
have 
the 
best 
applications 
and 
helps. 
And 
will 
you 
hearken 
to 
the 
Hebrew 
rabbins? 
“Your 
young 
men 
shall 
see 
visions, 
and 
your 
old 
men 
shall 
dream 
dreams:” 
say 
they, 
youth 
is 
the 
worthier 
age, 
for 
that 
visions 
are 
nearer 
apparitions 
of 
God 
than 
dreams? 
And 
let 
it 
be 
noted 
that 
howsoever 
the 
condition 
of 
life 
of 
pedantes 
hath 
been 
scorned 
upon 
theatres, 
as 
the 
ape 
of 
tyranny; 
and 
that 
the 
modern 
looseness 
or 
negligence 
hath 
taken 
no 
due 
regard 
to 
the 
choice 
of 
schoolmasters 
and 
tutors; 
yet 
the 
ancient 
wisdom 
of 
the 
best 
times 
did 
always 
make 
a 
just 
complaint, 
that 
states 
were 
too 
busy 
with 
their 
laws 
and 
too 
negligent 
in 
point 
of 
education: 
which 
excellent 
part 
of 
ancient 
discipline 
hath 
been 
in 
some 
sort 
revived 
of 
late 
times 
by 
the 
colleges 
of 
the 
Jesuits; 
of 

whom, 
although 
in 
regard 
of 
their 
superstition 
I 
may 
say, 
Quo 
meliores, 
eo 
deteriores; 
yet 
in 
regard 
of 
this, 
and 
some 
other 
points 
concerning 
human 
learning 
and 
moral 
matters, 
I 
may 
say, 
as 
Agesilaus 
said 
to 
his 
enemy 
Pharnabazus, 
Talis 
quum 
sis, 
utunam 
noster 
esses. 
And 
that 
much 
touching 
the 
discredits 
drawn 
from 
the 
fortunes 
of 
learned 
men. 


(4) 
As 
touching 
the 
manners 
of 
learned 
men, 
it 
is 
a 
thing 
personal 
and 
individual: 
and 
no 
doubt 
there 
be 
amongst 
them, 
as 
in 
other 
professions, 
of 
all 
temperatures: 
but 
yet 
so 
as 
it 
is 
not 
without 
truth 
which 
is 
said, 
that 
Abeunt 
studua 
in 
mores, 
studies 
have 
an 
influence 
and 
operation 
upon 
the 
manners 
of 
those 
that 
are 
conversant 
in 
them. 
(5) 
But 
upon 
an 
attentive 
and 
indifferent 
review, 
I 
for 
my 
part 
cannot 
find 
any 
disgrace 
to 
learning 
can 
proceed 
from 
the 
manners 
of 
learned 
men; 
not 
inherent 
to 
them 
as 
they 
are 
learned; 
except 
it 
be 
a 
fault 
(which 
was 
the 
supposed 
fault 
of 
Demosthenes, 
Cicero, 
Cato 
II., 
Seneca, 
and 
many 
more) 
that 
because 
the 
times 
they 
read 
of 
are 
commonly 
better 
than 
the 
times 
they 
live 
in, 
and 
the 
duties 
taught 
better 
than 
the 
duties 
practised, 
they 
contend 
sometimes 
too 
far 
to 
bring 
things 
to 
perfection, 
and 
to 
reduce 
the 
corruption 
of 
manners 
to 
honesty 
of 
precepts 
or 
examples 
of 
too 
great 
height. 
And 
yet 
hereof 
they 
have 
caveats 
enough 
in 
their 
own 
walks. 
For 
Solon, 
when 
he 
was 
asked 
whether 
he 
had 
given 
his 
citizens 
the 
best 
laws, 
answered 
wisely, 
“Yea, 
of 
such 
as 
they 
would 
receive:” 
and 
Plato, 
finding 
that 
his 
own 
heart 
could 
not 
agree 
with 
the 
corrupt 
manners 
of 
his 
country, 
refused 
to 
bear 
place 
or 
office, 
saying, 
“That 
a 
man’s 
country 
was 
to 
be 
used 
as 
his 
parents 
were, 
that 
is, 
with 
humble 
persuasions, 
and 
not 
with 
contestations.” 
And 
Caesar’s 
counsellor 
put 
in 
the 
same 
caveat, 
Non 
ad 
vetera 
instituta 
revocans 
quae 
jampridem 
corruptis 
moribus 
ludibrio 
sunt; 
and 
Cicero 
noteth 
this 
error 
directly 
in 
Cato 
II. 
when 
he 
writes 
to 
his 
friend 
Atticus, 
Cato 
optime 
sentit, 
sed 
nocet 
interdum 
reipublicae; 
loquitur 
enim 
tanquam 
in 
republica 
Platonis, 
non 
tanquam 
in 
faece 
Romuli. 
And 
the 
same 
Cicero 
doth 
excuse 
and 
expound 
the 
philosophers 
for 
going 
too 
far 
and 
being 
too 
exact 
in 
their 
prescripts 
when 
he 
saith, 
Isti 
ipse 
praeceptores 
virtutis 
et 
magistri 
videntur 
fines 
officiorum 
paulo 
longius 
quam 
natura 
vellet 
protulisse, 
ut 
cum 
ad 
ultimum 
animo 
contendissemus, 
ibi 
tamen, 
ubi 
oportet, 
consisteremus: 
and 
yet 
himself 
might 
have 
said, 
Monitis 
sum 
minor 
ipse 
meis; 
for 
it 
was 
his 
own 
fault, 
though 
not 
in 
so 
extreme 
a 
degree. 
(6) 
Another 
fault 
likewise 
much 
of 
this 
kind 
hath 
been 
incident 
to 

learned 
men, 
which 
is, 
that 
they 
have 
esteemed 
the 
preservation, 
good, 
and 
honour 
of 
their 
countries 
or 
masters 
before 
their 
own 
fortunes 
or 
safeties. 
For 
so 
saith 
Demosthenes 
unto 
the 
Athenians: 
“If 
it 
please 
you 
to 
note 
it, 
my 
counsels 
unto 
you 
are 
not 
such 
whereby 
I 
should 
grow 
great 
amongst 
you, 
and 
you 
become 
little 
amongst 
the 
Grecians; 
but 
they 
be 
of 
that 
nature 
as 
they 
are 
sometimes 
not 
good 
for 
me 
to 
give, 
but 
are 
always 
good 
for 
you 
to 
follow.” 
And 
so 
Seneca, 
after 
he 
had 
consecrated 
that 
Quinquennium 
Neronis 
to 
the 
eternal 
glory 
of 
learned 
governors, 
held 
on 
his 
honest 
and 
loyal 
course 
of 
good 
and 
free 
counsel 
after 
his 
master 
grew 
extremely 
corrupt 
in 
his 
government. 
Neither 
can 
this 
point 
otherwise 
be, 
for 
learning 
endueth 
men’s 
minds 
with 
a 
true 
sense 
of 
the 
frailty 
of 
their 
persons, 
the 
casualty 
of 
their 
fortunes, 
and 
the 
dignity 
of 
their 
soul 
and 
vocation, 
so 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
them 
to 
esteem 
that 
any 
greatness 
of 
their 
own 
fortune 
can 
be 
a 
true 
or 
worthy 
end 
of 
their 
being 
and 
ordainment, 
and 
therefore 
are 
desirous 
to 
give 
their 
account 
to 
God, 
and 
so 
likewise 
to 
their 
masters 
under 
God 
(as 
kings 
and 
the 
states 
that 
they 
serve) 
in 
those 
words, 
Ecce 
tibi 
lucrefeci, 
and 
not 
Ecce 
mihi 
lucrefeci; 
whereas 
the 
corrupter 
sort 
of 
mere 
politiques, 
that 
have 
not 
their 
thoughts 
established 
by 
learning 
in 
the 
love 
and 
apprehension 
of 
duty, 
nor 
never 
look 
abroad 
into 
universality, 
do 
refer 
all 
things 
to 
themselves, 
and 
thrust 
themselves 
into 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
world, 
as 
if 
all 
lines 
should 
meet 
in 
them 
and 
their 
fortunes, 
never 
caring 
in 
all 
tempests 
what 
becomes 
of 
the 
ship 
of 
state, 
so 
they 
may 
save 
themselves 
in 
the 
cockboat 
of 
their 
own 
fortune; 
whereas 
men 
that 
feel 
the 
weight 
of 
duty 
and 
know 
the 
limits 
of 
self-love 
use 
to 
make 
good 
their 
places 
and 
duties, 
though 
with 
peril; 
and 
if 
they 
stand 
in 
seditious 
and 
violent 
alterations, 
it 
is 
rather 
the 
reverence 
which 
many 
times 
both 
adverse 
parts 
do 
give 
to 
honesty, 
than 
any 
versatile 
advantage 
of 
their 
own 
carriage. 
But 
for 
this 
point 
of 
tender 
sense 
and 
fast 
obligation 
of 
duty 
which 
learning 
doth 
endue 
the 
mind 
withal, 
howsoever 
fortune 
may 
tax 
it, 
and 
many 
in 
the 
depth 
of 
their 
corrupt 
principles 
may 
despise 
it, 
yet 
it 
will 
receive 
an 
open 
allowance, 
and 
therefore 
needs 
the 
less 
disproof 
or 
excuse. 


(7) 
Another 
fault 
incident 
commonly 
to 
learned 
men, 
which 
may 
be 
more 
properly 
defended 
than 
truly 
denied, 
is 
that 
they 
fail 
sometimes 
in 
applying 
themselves 
to 
particular 
persons, 
which 
want 
of 
exact 
application 
ariseth 
from 
two 
causes 
— 
the 
one, 
because 
the 
largeness 
of 
their 
mind 
can 
hardly 
confine 
itself 
to 
dwell 
in 
the 
exquisite 
observation 
or 
examination 
of 
the 
nature 
and 
customs 
of 
one 
person, 
for 
it 
is 
a 
speech 
for 
a 
lover, 
and 
not 

for 
a 
wise 
man, 
Satis 
magnum 
alter 
alteri 
theatrum 
sumus. 
Nevertheless 
I 
shall 
yield 
that 
he 
that 
cannot 
contract 
the 
sight 
of 
his 
mind 
as 
well 
as 
disperse 
and 
dilate 
it, 
wanteth 
a 
great 
faculty. 
But 
there 
is 
a 
second 
cause, 
which 
is 
no 
inability, 
but 
a 
rejection 
upon 
choice 
and 
judgment. 
For 
the 
honest 
and 
just 
bounds 
of 
observation 
by 
one 
person 
upon 
another 
extend 
no 
further 
but 
to 
understand 
him 
sufficiently, 
whereby 
not 
to 
give 
him 
offence, 
or 
whereby 
to 
be 
able 
to 
give 
him 
faithful 
counsel, 
or 
whereby 
to 
stand 
upon 
reasonable 
guard 
and 
caution 
in 
respect 
of 
a 
man’s 
self. 
But 
to 
be 
speculative 
into 
another 
man 
to 
the 
end 
to 
know 
how 
to 
work 
him, 
or 
wind 
him, 
or 
govern 
him, 
proceedeth 
from 
a 
heart 
that 
is 
double 
and 
cloven, 
and 
not 
entire 
and 
ingenuous; 
which 
as 
in 
friendship 
it 
is 
want 
of 
integrity, 
so 
towards 
princes 
or 
superiors 
is 
want 
of 
duty. 
For 
the 
custom 
of 
the 
Levant, 
which 
is 
that 
subjects 
do 
forbear 
to 
gaze 
or 
fix 
their 
eyes 
upon 
princes, 
is 
in 
the 
outward 
ceremony 
barbarous, 
but 
the 
moral 
is 
good; 
for 
men 
ought 
not, 
by 
cunning 
and 
bent 
observations, 
to 
pierce 
and 
penetrate 
into 
the 
hearts 
of 
kings, 
which 
the 
Scripture 
hath 
declared 
to 
be 
inscrutable. 


(8) 
There 
is 
yet 
another 
fault 
(with 
which 
I 
will 
conclude 
this 
part) 
which 
is 
often 
noted 
in 
learned 
men, 
that 
they 
do 
many 
times 
fail 
to 
observe 
decency 
and 
discretion 
in 
their 
behaviour 
and 
carriage, 
and 
commit 
errors 
in 
small 
and 
ordinary 
points 
of 
action, 
so 
as 
the 
vulgar 
sort 
of 
capacities 
do 
make 
a 
judgment 
of 
them 
in 
greater 
matters 
by 
that 
which 
they 
find 
wanting 
in 
them 
in 
smaller. 
But 
this 
consequence 
doth 
oft 
deceive 
men, 
for 
which 
I 
do 
refer 
them 
over 
to 
that 
which 
was 
said 
by 
Themistocles, 
arrogantly 
and 
uncivilly 
being 
applied 
to 
himself 
out 
of 
his 
own 
mouth, 
but, 
being 
applied 
to 
the 
general 
state 
of 
this 
question, 
pertinently 
and 
justly, 
when, 
being 
invited 
to 
touch 
a 
lute, 
he 
said, 
“He 
could 
not 
fiddle, 
but 
he 
could 
make 
a 
small 
town 
a 
great 
state.” 
So 
no 
doubt 
many 
may 
be 
well 
seen 
in 
the 
passages 
of 
government 
and 
policy 
which 
are 
to 
seek 
in 
little 
and 
punctual 
occasions. 
I 
refer 
them 
also 
to 
that 
which 
Plato 
said 
of 
his 
master 
Socrates, 
whom 
he 
compared 
to 
the 
gallipots 
of 
apothecaries, 
which 
on 
the 
outside 
had 
apes 
and 
owls 
and 
antiques, 
but 
contained 
within 
sovereign 
and 
precious 
liquors 
and 
confections; 
acknowledging 
that, 
to 
an 
external 
report, 
he 
was 
not 
without 
superficial 
levities 
and 
deformities, 
but 
was 
inwardly 
replenished 
with 
excellent 
virtues 
and 
powers. 
And 
so 
much 
touching 
the 
point 
of 
manners 
of 
learned 
men. 
(9) 
But 
in 
the 
meantime 
I 
have 
no 
purpose 
to 
give 
allowance 
to 
some 

conditions 
and 
courses 
base 
and 
unworthy, 
wherein 
divers 
professors 
of 
learning 
have 
wronged 
themselves 
and 
gone 
too 
far; 
such 
as 
were 
those 
trencher 
philosophers 
which 
in 
the 
later 
age 
of 
the 
Roman 
state 
were 
usually 
in 
the 
houses 
of 
great 
persons, 
being 
little 
better 
than 
solemn 
parasites, 
of 
which 
kind, 
Lucian 
maketh 
a 
merry 
description 
of 
the 
philosopher 
that 
the 
great 
lady 
took 
to 
ride 
with 
her 
in 
her 
coach, 
and 
would 
needs 
have 
him 
carry 
her 
little 
dog, 
which 
he 
doing 
officiously 
and 
yet 
uncomely, 
the 
page 
scoffed 
and 
said, 
“That 
he 
doubted 
the 
philosopher 
of 
a 
Stoic 
would 
turn 
to 
be 
a 
Cynic.” 
But, 
above 
all 
the 
rest, 
this 
gross 
and 
palpable 
flattery 
whereunto 
many 
not 
unlearned 
have 
abased 
and 
abused 
their 
wits 
and 
pens, 
turning 
(as 
Du 
Bartas 
saith) 
Hecuba 
into 
Helena, 
and 
Faustina 
into 
Lucretia, 
hath 
most 
diminished 
the 
price 
and 
estimation 
of 
learning. 
Neither 
is 
the 
modern 
dedication 
of 
books 
and 
writings, 
as 
to 
patrons, 
to 
be 
commended, 
for 
that 
books 
(such 
as 
are 
worthy 
the 
name 
of 
books) 
ought 
to 
have 
no 
patrons 
but 
truth 
and 
reason. 
And 
the 
ancient 
custom 
was 
to 
dedicate 
them 
only 
to 
private 
and 
equal 
friends, 
or 
to 
entitle 
the 
books 
with 
their 
names; 
or 
if 
to 
kings 
and 
great 
persons, 
it 
was 
to 
some 
such 
as 
the 
argument 
of 
the 
book 
was 
fit 
and 
proper 
for; 
but 
these 
and 
the 
like 
courses 
may 
deserve 
rather 
reprehension 
than 
defence. 


(10) 
Not 
that 
I 
can 
tax 
or 
condemn 
the 
morigeration 
or 
application 
of 
learned 
men 
to 
men 
in 
fortune. 
For 
the 
answer 
was 
good 
that 
Diogenes 
made 
to 
one 
that 
asked 
him 
in 
mockery, 
“How 
it 
came 
to 
pass 
that 
philosophers 
were 
the 
followers 
of 
rich 
men, 
and 
not 
rich 
men 
of 
philosophers?” 
He 
answered 
soberly, 
and 
yet 
sharply, 
“Because 
the 
one 
sort 
knew 
what 
they 
had 
need 
of, 
and 
the 
other 
did 
not.” 
And 
of 
the 
like 
nature 
was 
the 
answer 
which 
Aristippus 
made, 
when 
having 
a 
petition 
to 
Dionysius, 
and 
no 
ear 
given 
to 
him, 
he 
fell 
down 
at 
his 
feet, 
whereupon 
Dionysius 
stayed 
and 
gave 
him 
the 
hearing, 
and 
granted 
it; 
and 
afterwards 
some 
person, 
tender 
on 
the 
behalf 
of 
philosophy, 
reproved 
Aristippus 
that 
he 
would 
offer 
the 
profession 
of 
philosophy 
such 
an 
indignity 
as 
for 
a 
private 
suit 
to 
fall 
at 
a 
tyrant’s 
feet; 
but 
he 
answered, 
“It 
was 
not 
his 
fault, 
but 
it 
was 
the 
fault 
of 
Dionysius, 
that 
had 
his 
ears 
in 
his 
feet.” 
Neither 
was 
it 
accounted 
weakness, 
but 
discretion, 
in 
him 
that 
would 
not 
dispute 
his 
best 
with 
Adrianus 
Caesar, 
excusing 
himself, 
“That 
it 
was 
reason 
to 
yield 
to 
him 
that 
commanded 
thirty 
legions.” 
These 
and 
the 
like, 
applications, 
and 
stooping 
to 
points 
of 
necessity 
and 
convenience, 
cannot 
be 
disallowed; 
for 
though 
they 
may 
have 
some 
outward 
baseness, 
yet 
in 
a 
judgment 
truly 
made 
they 
are 
to 
be 
accounted 
submissions 

to 
the 
occasion 
and 
not 
to 
the 
person. 



IV 


(1) 
Now 
I 
proceed 
to 
those 
errors 
and 
vanities 
which 
have 
intervened 
amongst 
the 
studies 
themselves 
of 
the 
learned, 
which 
is 
that 
which 
is 
principal 
and 
proper 
to 
the 
present 
argument; 
wherein 
my 
purpose 
is 
not 
to 
make 
a 
justification 
of 
the 
errors, 
but 
by 
a 
censure 
and 
separation 
of 
the 
errors 
to 
make 
a 
justification 
of 
that 
which 
is 
good 
and 
sound, 
and 
to 
deliver 
that 
from 
the 
aspersion 
of 
the 
other. 
For 
we 
see 
that 
it 
is 
the 
manner 
of 
men 
to 
scandalise 
and 
deprave 
that 
which 
retaineth 
the 
state 
and 
virtue, 
by 
taking 
advantage 
upon 
that 
which 
is 
corrupt 
and 
degenerate, 
as 
the 
heathens 
in 
the 
primitive 
Church 
used 
to 
blemish 
and 
taint 
the 
Christians 
with 
the 
faults 
and 
corruptions 
of 
heretics. 
But 
nevertheless 
I 
have 
no 
meaning 
at 
this 
time 
to 
make 
any 
exact 
animadversion 
of 
the 
errors 
and 
impediments 
in 
matters 
of 
learning, 
which 
are 
more 
secret 
and 
remote 
from 
vulgar 
opinion, 
but 
only 
to 
speak 
unto 
such 
as 
do 
fall 
under 
or 
near 
unto 
a 
popular 
observation. 
(2) 
There 
be 
therefore 
chiefly 
three 
vanities 
in 
studies, 
whereby 
learning 
hath 
been 
most 
traduced. 
For 
those 
things 
we 
do 
esteem 
vain 
which 
are 
either 
false 
or 
frivolous, 
those 
which 
either 
have 
no 
truth 
or 
no 
use; 
and 
those 
persons 
we 
esteem 
vain 
which 
are 
either 
credulous 
or 
curious; 
and 
curiosity 
is 
either 
in 
matter 
or 
words: 
so 
that 
in 
reason 
as 
well 
as 
in 
experience 
there 
fall 
out 
to 
be 
these 
three 
distempers 
(as 
I 
may 
term 
them) 
of 
learning 
— 
the 
first, 
fantastical 
learning; 
the 
second, 
contentious 
learning; 
and 
the 
last, 
delicate 
learning; 
vain 
imaginations, 
vain 
altercations, 
and 
vain 
affectations; 
and 
with 
the 
last 
I 
will 
begin. 
Martin 
Luther, 
conducted, 
no 
doubt, 
by 
a 
higher 
Providence, 
but 
in 
discourse 
of 
reason, 
finding 
what 
a 
province 
he 
had 
undertaken 
against 
the 
Bishop 
of 
Rome 
and 
the 
degenerate 
traditions 
of 
the 
Church, 
and 
finding 
his 
own 
solitude, 
being 
in 
nowise 
aided 
by 
the 
opinions 
of 
his 
own 
time, 
was 
enforced 
to 
awake 
all 
antiquity, 
and 
to 
call 
former 
times 
to 
his 
succours 
to 
make 
a 
party 
against 
the 
present 
time. 
So 
that 
the 
ancient 
authors, 
both 
in 
divinity 
and 
in 
humanity, 
which 
had 
long 
time 
slept 
in 
libraries, 
began 
generally 
to 
be 
read 
and 
revolved. 
This, 
by 
consequence, 
did 
draw 
on 
a 
necessity 
of 
a 
more 
exquisite 
travail 
in 
the 
languages 
original, 
wherein 
those 
authors 
did 
write, 
for 
the 
better 
understanding 
of 
those 
authors, 
and 
the 
better 
advantage 
of 
pressing 
and 

applying 
their 
words. 
And 
thereof 
grew, 
again, 
a 
delight 
in 
their 
manner 
of 
style 
and 
phrase, 
and 
an 
admiration 
of 
that 
kind 
of 
writing, 
which 
was 
much 
furthered 
and 
precipitated 
by 
the 
enmity 
and 
opposition 
that 
the 
propounders 
of 
those 
primitive 
but 
seeming 
new 
opinions 
had 
against 
the 
schoolmen, 
who 
were 
generally 
of 
the 
contrary 
part, 
and 
whose 
writings 
were 
altogether 
in 
a 
differing 
style 
and 
form; 
taking 
liberty 
to 
coin 
and 
frame 
new 
terms 
of 
art 
to 
express 
their 
own 
sense, 
and 
to 
avoid 
circuit 
of 
speech, 
without 
regard 
to 
the 
pureness, 
pleasantness, 
and 
(as 
I 
may 
call 
it) 
lawfulness 
of 
the 
phrase 
or 
word. 
And 
again, 
because 
the 
great 
labour 
then 
was 
with 
the 
people 
(of 
whom 
the 
Pharisees 
were 
wont 
to 
say, 
Execrabilis 
ista 
turba, 
quae 
non 
novit 
legem), 
for 
the 
winning 
and 
persuading 
of 
them, 
there 
grew 
of 
necessity 
in 
chief 
price 
and 
request 
eloquence 
and 
variety 
of 
discourse, 
as 
the 
fittest 
and 
forciblest 
access 
into 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
vulgar 
sort; 
so 
that 
these 
four 
causes 
concurring 
— 
the 
admiration 
of 
ancient 
authors, 
the 
hate 
of 
the 
schoolmen, 
the 
exact 
study 
of 
languages, 
and 
the 
efficacy 
of 
preaching 
— 
did 
bring 
in 
an 
affectionate 
study 
of 
eloquence 
and 
copy 
of 
speech, 
which 
then 
began 
to 
flourish. 
This 
grew 
speedily 
to 
an 
excess; 
for 
men 
began 
to 
hunt 
more 
after 
words 
than 
matter 
— 
more 
after 
the 
choiceness 
of 
the 
phrase, 
and 
the 
round 
and 
clean 
composition 
of 
the 
sentence, 
and 
the 
sweet 
falling 
of 
the 
clauses, 
and 
the 
varying 
and 
illustration 
of 
their 
works 
with 
tropes 
and 
figures, 
than 
after 
the 
weight 
of 
matter, 
worth 
of 
subject, 
soundness 
of 
argument, 
life 
of 
invention, 
or 
depth 
of 
judgment. 
Then 
grew 
the 
flowing 
and 
watery 
vein 
of 
Osorius, 
the 
Portugal 
bishop, 
to 
be 
in 
price. 
Then 
did 
Sturmius 
spend 
such 
infinite 
and 
curious 
pains 
upon 
Cicero 
the 
Orator 
and 
Hermogenes 
the 
Rhetorician, 
besides 
his 
own 
books 
of 
Periods 
and 
Imitation, 
and 
the 
like. 
Then 
did 
Car 
of 
Cambridge 
and 
Ascham 
with 
their 
lectures 
and 
writings 
almost 
deify 
Cicero 
and 
Demosthenes, 
and 
allure 
all 
young 
men 
that 
were 
studious 
unto 
that 
delicate 
and 
polished 
kind 
of 
learning. 
Then 
did 
Erasmus 
take 
occasion 
to 
make 
the 
scoffing 
echo, 
Decem 
annos 
consuumpsi 
in 
legendo 
Cicerone; 
and 
the 
echo 
answered 
in 
Greek, 
One, 
Asine. 
Then 
grew 
the 
learning 
of 
the 
schoolmen 
to 
be 
utterly 
despised 
as 
barbarous. 
In 
sum, 
the 
whole 
inclination 
and 
bent 
of 
those 
times 
was 
rather 
towards 
copy 
than 
weight. 


(3) 
Here 
therefore 
[is] 
the 
first 
distemper 
of 
learning, 
when 
men 
study 
words 
and 
not 
matter; 
whereof, 
though 
I 
have 
represented 
an 
example 
of 
late 
times, 
yet 
it 
hath 
been 
and 
will 
be 
secundum 
majus 
et 
minus 
in 
all 
time. 
And 
how 
is 
it 
possible 
but 
this 
should 
have 
an 
operation 
to 
discredit 

learning, 
even 
with 
vulgar 
capacities, 
when 
they 
see 
learned 
men’s 
works 
like 
the 
first 
letter 
of 
a 
patent 
or 
limited 
book, 
which 
though 
it 
hath 
large 
flourishes, 
yet 
it 
is 
but 
a 
letter? 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
Pygmalion’s 
frenzy 
is 
a 
good 
emblem 
or 
portraiture 
of 
this 
vanity; 
for 
words 
are 
but 
the 
images 
of 
matter, 
and 
except 
they 
have 
life 
of 
reason 
and 
invention, 
to 
fall 
in 
love 
with 
them 
is 
all 
one 
as 
to 
fall 
in 
love 
with 
a 
picture. 


(4) 
But 
yet 
notwithstanding 
it 
is 
a 
thing 
not 
hastily 
to 
be 
condemned, 
to 
clothe 
and 
adorn 
the 
obscurity 
even 
of 
philosophy 
itself 
with 
sensible 
and 
plausible 
elocution. 
For 
hereof 
we 
have 
great 
examples 
in 
Xenophon, 
Cicero, 
Seneca, 
Plutarch, 
and 
of 
Plato 
also 
in 
some 
degree; 
and 
hereof 
likewise 
there 
is 
great 
use, 
for 
surely, 
to 
the 
severe 
inquisition 
of 
truth 
and 
the 
deep 
progress 
into 
philosophy, 
it 
is 
some 
hindrance 
because 
it 
is 
too 
early 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
mind 
of 
man, 
and 
quencheth 
the 
desire 
of 
further 
search 
before 
we 
come 
to 
a 
just 
period. 
But 
then 
if 
a 
man 
be 
to 
have 
any 
use 
of 
such 
knowledge 
in 
civil 
occasions, 
of 
conference, 
counsel, 
persuasion, 
discourse, 
or 
the 
like, 
then 
shall 
he 
find 
it 
prepared 
to 
his 
hands 
in 
those 
authors 
which 
write 
in 
that 
manner. 
But 
the 
excess 
of 
this 
is 
so 
justly 
contemptible, 
that 
as 
Hercules, 
when 
he 
saw 
the 
image 
of 
Adonis, 
Venus’ 
minion, 
in 
a 
temple, 
said 
in 
disdain, 
Nil 
sacri 
es; 
so 
there 
is 
none 
of 
Hercules’ 
followers 
in 
learning 
— 
that 
is, 
the 
more 
severe 
and 
laborious 
sort 
of 
inquirers 
into 
truth 
— 
but 
will 
despise 
those 
delicacies 
and 
affectations, 
as 
indeed 
capable 
of 
no 
divineness. 
And 
thus 
much 
of 
the 
first 
disease 
or 
distemper 
of 
learning. 
(5) 
The 
second 
which 
followeth 
is 
in 
nature 
worse 
than 
the 
former: 
for 
as 
substance 
of 
matter 
is 
better 
than 
beauty 
of 
words, 
so 
contrariwise 
vain 
matter 
is 
worse 
than 
vain 
words: 
wherein 
it 
seemeth 
the 
reprehension 
of 
St. 
Paul 
was 
not 
only 
proper 
for 
those 
times, 
but 
prophetical 
for 
the 
times 
following; 
and 
not 
only 
respective 
to 
divinity, 
but 
extensive 
to 
all 
knowledge: 
Devita 
profanas 
vocum 
novitates, 
et 
oppositiones 
falsi 
nominis 
scientiae. 
For 
he 
assigneth 
two 
marks 
and 
badges 
of 
suspected 
and 
falsified 
science: 
the 
one, 
the 
novelty 
and 
strangeness 
of 
terms; 
the 
other, 
the 
strictness 
of 
positions, 
which 
of 
necessity 
doth 
induce 
oppositions, 
and 
so 
questions 
and 
altercations. 
Surely, 
like 
as 
many 
substances 
in 
nature 
which 
are 
solid 
do 
putrefy 
and 
corrupt 
into 
worms;— 
so 
it 
is 
the 
property 
of 
good 
and 
sound 
knowledge 
to 
putrefy 
and 
dissolve 
into 
a 
number 
of 
subtle, 
idle, 
unwholesome, 
and 
(as 
I 
may 
term 
them) 
vermiculate 
questions, 
which 
have 
indeed 
a 
kind 
of 
quickness 
and 
life 
of 
spirit, 
but 
no 
soundness 
of 
matter 
or 

goodness 
of 
quality. 
This 
kind 
of 
degenerate 
learning 
did 
chiefly 
reign 
amongst 
the 
schoolmen, 
who 
having 
sharp 
and 
strong 
wits, 
and 
abundance 
of 
leisure, 
and 
small 
variety 
of 
reading, 
but 
their 
wits 
being 
shut 
up 
in 
the 
cells 
of 
a 
few 
authors 
(chiefly 
Aristotle 
their 
dictator) 
as 
their 
persons 
were 
shut 
up 
in 
the 
cells 
of 
monasteries 
and 
colleges, 
and 
knowing 
little 
history, 
either 
of 
nature 
or 
time, 
did 
out 
of 
no 
great 
quantity 
of 
matter 
and 
infinite 
agitation 
of 
wit 
spin 
out 
unto 
us 
those 
laborious 
webs 
of 
learning 
which 
are 
extant 
in 
their 
books. 
For 
the 
wit 
and 
mind 
of 
man, 
if 
it 
work 
upon 
matter, 
which 
is 
the 
contemplation 
of 
the 
creatures 
of 
God, 
worketh 
according 
to 
the 
stuff 
and 
is 
limited 
thereby; 
but 
if 
it 
work 
upon 
itself, 
as 
the 
spider 
worketh 
his 
web, 
then 
it 
is 
endless, 
and 
brings 
forth 
indeed 
cobwebs 
of 
learning, 
admirable 
for 
the 
fineness 
of 
thread 
and 
work, 
but 
of 
no 
substance 
or 
profit. 


(6) 
This 
same 
unprofitable 
subtility 
or 
curiosity 
is 
of 
two 
sorts: 
either 
in 
the 
subject 
itself 
that 
they 
handle, 
when 
it 
is 
a 
fruitless 
speculation 
or 
controversy 
(whereof 
there 
are 
no 
small 
number 
both 
in 
divinity 
and 
philosophy), 
or 
in 
the 
manner 
or 
method 
of 
handling 
of 
a 
knowledge, 
which 
amongst 
them 
was 
this 
— 
upon 
every 
particular 
position 
or 
assertion 
to 
frame 
objections, 
and 
to 
those 
objections, 
solutions; 
which 
solutions 
were 
for 
the 
most 
part 
not 
confutations, 
but 
distinctions: 
whereas 
indeed 
the 
strength 
of 
all 
sciences 
is, 
as 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
old 
man’s 
faggot, 
in 
the 
bond. 
For 
the 
harmony 
of 
a 
science, 
supporting 
each 
part 
the 
other, 
is 
and 
ought 
to 
be 
the 
true 
and 
brief 
confutation 
and 
suppression 
of 
all 
the 
smaller 
sort 
of 
objections. 
But, 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
if 
you 
take 
out 
every 
axiom, 
as 
the 
sticks 
of 
the 
faggot, 
one 
by 
one, 
you 
may 
quarrel 
with 
them 
and 
bend 
them 
and 
break 
them 
at 
your 
pleasure: 
so 
that, 
as 
was 
said 
of 
Seneca, 
Verborum 
minutiis 
rerum 
frangit 
pondera, 
so 
a 
man 
may 
truly 
say 
of 
the 
schoolmen, 
Quaestionum 
minutiis 
scientiarum 
frangunt 
soliditatem. 
For 
were 
it 
not 
better 
for 
a 
man 
in 
fair 
room 
to 
set 
up 
one 
great 
light, 
or 
branching 
candlestick 
of 
lights, 
than 
to 
go 
about 
with 
a 
small 
watch-candle 
into 
every 
corner? 
And 
such 
is 
their 
method, 
that 
rests 
not 
so 
much 
upon 
evidence 
of 
truth 
proved 
by 
arguments, 
authorities, 
similitudes, 
examples, 
as 
upon 
particular 
confutations 
and 
solutions 
of 
every 
scruple, 
cavillation, 
and 
objection; 
breeding 
for 
the 
most 
part 
one 
question 
as 
fast 
as 
it 
solveth 
another; 
even 
as 
in 
the 
former 
resemblance, 
when 
you 
carry 
the 
light 
into 
one 
corner, 
you 
darken 
the 
rest; 
so 
that 
the 
fable 
and 
fiction 
of 
Scylla 
seemeth 
to 
be 
a 
lively 
image 
of 
this 
kind 
of 
philosophy 
or 
knowledge; 
which 
was 
transformed 
into 
a 
comely 
virgin 
for 
the 
upper 
parts; 
but 
then 
Candida 
succinctam 
latrantibus 
inguina 
monstris: 
so 

the 
generalities 
of 
the 
schoolmen 
are 
for 
a 
while 
good 
and 
proportionable; 
but 
then 
when 
you 
descend 
into 
their 
distinctions 
and 
decisions, 
instead 
of 
a 
fruitful 
womb 
for 
the 
use 
and 
benefit 
of 
man’s 
life, 
they 
end 
in 
monstrous 
altercations 
and 
barking 
questions. 
So 
as 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
but 
this 
quality 
of 
knowledge 
must 
fall 
under 
popular 
contempt, 
the 
people 
being 
apt 
to 
contemn 
truths 
upon 
occasion 
of 
controversies 
and 
altercations, 
and 
to 
think 
they 
are 
all 
out 
of 
their 
way 
which 
never 
meet; 
and 
when 
they 
see 
such 
digladiation 
about 
subtleties, 
and 
matters 
of 
no 
use 
or 
moment, 
they 
easily 
fall 
upon 
that 
judgment 
of 
Dionysius 
of 
Syracusa, 
Verba 
ista 
sunt 
senum 
otiosorum. 


(7) 
Notwithstanding, 
certain 
it 
is 
that 
if 
those 
schoolmen 
to 
their 
great 
thirst 
of 
truth 
and 
unwearied 
travail 
of 
wit 
had 
joined 
variety 
and 
universality 
of 
reading 
and 
contemplation, 
they 
had 
proved 
excellent 
lights, 
to 
the 
great 
advancement 
of 
all 
learning 
and 
knowledge; 
but 
as 
they 
are, 
they 
are 
great 
undertakers 
indeed, 
and 
fierce 
with 
dark 
keeping. 
But 
as 
in 
the 
inquiry 
of 
the 
divine 
truth, 
their 
pride 
inclined 
to 
leave 
the 
oracle 
of 
God’s 
word, 
and 
to 
vanish 
in 
the 
mixture 
of 
their 
own 
inventions; 
so 
in 
the 
inquisition 
of 
nature, 
they 
ever 
left 
the 
oracle 
of 
God’s 
works, 
and 
adored 
the 
deceiving 
and 
deformed 
images 
which 
the 
unequal 
mirror 
of 
their 
own 
minds, 
or 
a 
few 
received 
authors 
or 
principles, 
did 
represent 
unto 
them. 
And 
thus 
much 
for 
the 
second 
disease 
of 
learning. 
(8) 
For 
the 
third 
vice 
or 
disease 
of 
learning, 
which 
concerneth 
deceit 
or 
untruth, 
it 
is 
of 
all 
the 
rest 
the 
foulest; 
as 
that 
which 
doth 
destroy 
the 
essential 
form 
of 
knowledge, 
which 
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
representation 
of 
truth: 
for 
the 
truth 
of 
being 
and 
the 
truth 
of 
knowing 
are 
one, 
differing 
no 
more 
than 
the 
direct 
beam 
and 
the 
beam 
reflected. 
This 
vice 
therefore 
brancheth 
itself 
into 
two 
sorts; 
delight 
in 
deceiving 
and 
aptness 
to 
be 
deceived; 
imposture 
and 
credulity; 
which, 
although 
they 
appear 
to 
be 
of 
a 
diverse 
nature, 
the 
one 
seeming 
to 
proceed 
of 
cunning 
and 
the 
other 
of 
simplicity, 
yet 
certainly 
they 
do 
for 
the 
most 
part 
concur: 
for, 
as 
the 
verse 
noteth 
— 
“Percontatorem 
fugito, 
nam 
garrulus 
idem 
est,” 


an 
inquisitive 
man 
is 
a 
prattler; 
so 
upon 
the 
like 
reason 
a 
credulous 
man 
is 
a 
deceiver: 
as 
we 
see 
it 
in 
fame, 
that 
he 
that 
will 
easily 
believe 
rumours 
will 
as 
easily 
augment 
rumours 
and 
add 
somewhat 
to 
them 
of 
his 
own; 
which 
Tacitus 
wisely 
noteth, 
when 
he 
saith, 
Fingunt 
simul 
creduntque: 



so 
great 
an 
affinity 
hath 
fiction 
and 
belief. 


(9) 
This 
facility 
of 
credit 
and 
accepting 
or 
admitting 
things 
weakly 
authorised 
or 
warranted 
is 
of 
two 
kinds 
according 
to 
the 
subject: 
for 
it 
is 
either 
a 
belief 
of 
history, 
or, 
as 
the 
lawyers 
speak, 
matter 
of 
fact; 
or 
else 
of 
matter 
of 
art 
and 
opinion. 
As 
to 
the 
former, 
we 
see 
the 
experience 
and 
inconvenience 
of 
this 
error 
in 
ecclesiastical 
history; 
which 
hath 
too 
easily 
received 
and 
registered 
reports 
and 
narrations 
of 
miracles 
wrought 
by 
martyrs, 
hermits, 
or 
monks 
of 
the 
desert, 
and 
other 
holy 
men, 
and 
their 
relics, 
shrines, 
chapels 
and 
images: 
which 
though 
they 
had 
a 
passage 
for 
a 
time 
by 
the 
ignorance 
of 
the 
people, 
the 
superstitious 
simplicity 
of 
some 
and 
the 
politic 
toleration 
of 
others 
holding 
them 
but 
as 
divine 
poesies, 
yet 
after 
a 
period 
of 
time, 
when 
the 
mist 
began 
to 
clear 
up, 
they 
grew 
to 
be 
esteemed 
but 
as 
old 
wives’ 
fables, 
impostures 
of 
the 
clergy, 
illusions 
of 
spirits, 
and 
badges 
of 
Antichrist, 
to 
the 
great 
scandal 
and 
detriment 
of 
religion. 
(10) 
So 
in 
natural 
history, 
we 
see 
there 
hath 
not 
been 
that 
choice 
and 
judgment 
used 
as 
ought 
to 
have 
been; 
as 
may 
appear 
in 
the 
writings 
of 
Plinius, 
Cardanus, 
Albertus, 
and 
divers 
of 
the 
Arabians, 
being 
fraught 
with 
much 
fabulous 
matter, 
a 
great 
part 
not 
only 
untried, 
but 
notoriously 
untrue, 
to 
the 
great 
derogation 
of 
the 
credit 
of 
natural 
philosophy 
with 
the 
grave 
and 
sober 
kind 
of 
wits: 
wherein 
the 
wisdom 
and 
integrity 
of 
Aristotle 
is 
worthy 
to 
be 
observed, 
that, 
having 
made 
so 
diligent 
and 
exquisite 
a 
history 
of 
living 
creatures, 
hath 
mingled 
it 
sparingly 
with 
any 
vain 
or 
feigned 
matter; 
and 
yet 
on 
the 
other 
side 
hath 
cast 
all 
prodigious 
narrations, 
which 
he 
thought 
worthy 
the 
recording, 
into 
one 
book, 
excellently 
discerning 
that 
matter 
of 
manifest 
truth, 
such 
whereupon 
observation 
and 
rule 
was 
to 
be 
built, 
was 
not 
to 
be 
mingled 
or 
weakened 
with 
matter 
of 
doubtful 
credit; 
and 
yet 
again, 
that 
rarities 
and 
reports 
that 
seem 
uncredible 
are 
not 
to 
be 
suppressed 
or 
denied 
to 
the 
memory 
of 
men. 
(11) 
And 
as 
for 
the 
facility 
of 
credit 
which 
is 
yielded 
to 
arts 
and 
opinions, 
it 
is 
likewise 
of 
two 
kinds; 
either 
when 
too 
much 
belief 
is 
attributed 
to 
the 
arts 
themselves, 
or 
to 
certain 
authors 
in 
any 
art. 
The 
sciences 
themselves, 
which 
have 
had 
better 
intelligence 
and 
confederacy 
with 
the 
imagination 
of 
man 
than 
with 
his 
reason, 
are 
three 
in 
number: 
astrology, 
natural 
magic, 
and 
alchemy; 
of 
which 
sciences, 
nevertheless, 
the 
ends 
or 
pretences 
are 
noble. 
For 
astrology 
pretendeth 
to 
discover 
that 
correspondence 
or 
concatenation 
which 
is 
between 
the 
superior 
globe 
and 
the 
inferior; 
natural 

magic 
pretendeth 
to 
call 
and 
reduce 
natural 
philosophy 
from 
variety 
of 
speculations 
to 
the 
magnitude 
of 
works; 
and 
alchemy 
pretendeth 
to 
make 
separation 
of 
all 
the 
unlike 
parts 
of 
bodies 
which 
in 
mixtures 
of 
natures 
are 
incorporate. 
But 
the 
derivations 
and 
prosecutions 
to 
these 
ends, 
both 
in 
the 
theories 
and 
in 
the 
practices, 
are 
full 
of 
error 
and 
vanity; 
which 
the 
great 
professors 
themselves 
have 
sought 
to 
veil 
over 
and 
conceal 
by 
enigmatical 
writings, 
and 
referring 
themselves 
to 
auricular 
traditions 
and 
such 
other 
devices, 
to 
save 
the 
credit 
of 
impostures. 
And 
yet 
surely 
to 
alchemy 
this 
right 
is 
due, 
that 
it 
may 
be 
compared 
to 
the 
husbandman 
whereof 
AEsop 
makes 
the 
fable; 
that, 
when 
he 
died, 
told 
his 
sons 
that 
he 
had 
left 
unto 
them 
gold 
buried 
underground 
in 
his 
vineyard; 
and 
they 
digged 
over 
all 
the 
ground, 
and 
gold 
they 
found 
none; 
but 
by 
reason 
of 
their 
stirring 
and 
digging 
the 
mould 
about 
the 
roots 
of 
their 
vines, 
they 
had 
a 
great 
vintage 
the 
year 
following: 
so 
assuredly 
the 
search 
and 
stir 
to 
make 
gold 
hath 
brought 
to 
light 
a 
great 
number 
of 
good 
and 
fruitful 
inventions 
and 
experiments, 
as 
well 
for 
the 
disclosing 
of 
nature 
as 
for 
the 
use 
of 
man’s 
life. 


(12) 
And 
as 
for 
the 
overmuch 
credit 
that 
hath 
been 
given 
unto 
authors 
in 
sciences, 
in 
making 
them 
dictators, 
that 
their 
words 
should 
stand, 
and 
not 
consuls, 
to 
give 
advice; 
the 
damage 
is 
infinite 
that 
sciences 
have 
received 
thereby, 
as 
the 
principal 
cause 
that 
hath 
kept 
them 
low 
at 
a 
stay 
without 
growth 
or 
advancement. 
For 
hence 
it 
hath 
come, 
that 
in 
arts 
mechanical 
the 
first 
deviser 
comes 
shortest, 
and 
time 
addeth 
and 
perfecteth; 
but 
in 
sciences 
the 
first 
author 
goeth 
furthest, 
and 
time 
leeseth 
and 
corrupteth. 
So 
we 
see 
artillery, 
sailing, 
printing, 
and 
the 
like, 
were 
grossly 
managed 
at 
the 
first, 
and 
by 
time 
accommodated 
and 
refined; 
but 
contrariwise, 
the 
philosophies 
and 
sciences 
of 
Aristotle, 
Plato, 
Democritus, 
Hippocrates, 
Euclides, 
Archimedes, 
of 
most 
vigour 
at 
the 
first, 
and 
by 
time 
degenerate 
and 
imbased: 
whereof 
the 
reason 
is 
no 
other, 
but 
that 
in 
the 
former 
many 
wits 
and 
industries 
have 
contributed 
in 
one; 
and 
in 
the 
latter 
many 
wits 
and 
industries 
have 
been 
spent 
about 
the 
wit 
of 
some 
one, 
whom 
many 
times 
they 
have 
rather 
depraved 
than 
illustrated; 
for, 
as 
water 
will 
not 
ascend 
higher 
than 
the 
level 
of 
the 
first 
spring-head 
from 
whence 
it 
descendeth, 
so 
knowledge 
derived 
from 
Aristotle, 
and 
exempted 
from 
liberty 
of 
examination, 
will 
not 
rise 
again 
higher 
than 
the 
knowledge 
of 
Aristotle. 
And, 
therefore, 
although 
the 
position 
be 
good, 
Oportet 
discentem 
credere, 
yet 
it 
must 
be 
coupled 
with 
this, 
Oportet 
edoctum 
judicare; 
for 
disciples 
do 
owe 
unto 
masters 
only 
a 
temporary 
belief 
and 
a 
suspension 
of 
their 
own 
judgment 
till 
they 
be 
fully 

instructed, 
and 
not 
an 
absolute 
resignation 
or 
perpetual 
captivity; 
and 
therefore, 
to 
conclude 
this 
point, 
I 
will 
say 
no 
more, 
but 
so 
let 
great 
authors 
have 
their 
due, 
as 
time, 
which 
is 
the 
author 
of 
authors, 
be 
not 
deprived 
of 
his 
due 
— 
which 
is, 
further 
and 
further 
to 
discover 
truth. 
Thus 
have 
I 
gone 
over 
these 
three 
diseases 
of 
learning; 
besides 
the 
which 
there 
are 
some 
other 
rather 
peccant 
humours 
than 
formed 
diseases, 
which, 
nevertheless, 
are 
not 
so 
secret 
and 
intrinsic, 
but 
that 
they 
fall 
under 
a 
popular 
observation 
and 
traducement, 
and, 
therefore, 
are 
not 
to 
be 
passed 
over. 



V 


(1) 
The 
first 
of 
these 
is 
the 
extreme 
affecting 
of 
two 
extremities: 
the 
one 
antiquity, 
the 
other 
novelty; 
wherein 
it 
seemeth 
the 
children 
of 
time 
do 
take 
after 
the 
nature 
and 
malice 
of 
the 
father. 
For 
as 
he 
devoureth 
his 
children, 
so 
one 
of 
them 
seeketh 
to 
devour 
and 
suppress 
the 
other; 
while 
antiquity 
envieth 
there 
should 
be 
new 
additions, 
and 
novelty 
cannot 
be 
content 
to 
add 
but 
it 
must 
deface; 
surely 
the 
advice 
of 
the 
prophet 
is 
the 
true 
direction 
in 
this 
matter, 
State 
super 
vias 
antiquas, 
et 
videte 
quaenam 
sit 
via 
recta 
et 
bona 
et 
ambulate 
in 
ea. 
Antiquity 
deserveth 
that 
reverence, 
that 
men 
should 
make 
a 
stand 
thereupon 
and 
discover 
what 
is 
the 
best 
way; 
but 
when 
the 
discovery 
is 
well 
taken, 
then 
to 
make 
progression. 
And 
to 
speak 
truly, 
Antiquitas 
saeculi 
juventus 
mundi. 
These 
times 
are 
the 
ancient 
times, 
when 
the 
world 
is 
ancient, 
and 
not 
those 
which 
we 
account 
ancient 
ordine 
retrogrado, 
by 
a 
computation 
backward 
from 
ourselves. 
(2) 
Another 
error 
induced 
by 
the 
former 
is 
a 
distrust 
that 
anything 
should 
be 
now 
to 
be 
found 
out, 
which 
the 
world 
should 
have 
missed 
and 
passed 
over 
so 
long 
time: 
as 
if 
the 
same 
objection 
were 
to 
be 
made 
to 
time 
that 
Lucian 
maketh 
to 
Jupiter 
and 
other 
the 
heathen 
gods; 
of 
which 
he 
wondereth 
that 
they 
begot 
so 
many 
children 
in 
old 
time, 
and 
begot 
none 
in 
his 
time; 
and 
asketh 
whether 
they 
were 
become 
septuagenary, 
or 
whether 
the 
law 
Papia, 
made 
against 
old 
men’s 
marriages, 
had 
restrained 
them. 
So 
it 
seemeth 
men 
doubt 
lest 
time 
is 
become 
past 
children 
and 
generation; 
wherein 
contrariwise 
we 
see 
commonly 
the 
levity 
and 
unconstancy 
of 
men’s 
judgments, 
which, 
till 
a 
matter 
be 
done, 
wonder 
that 
it 
can 
be 
done; 
and 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
is 
done, 
wonder 
again 
that 
it 
was 
no 
sooner 
done: 
as 
we 
see 
in 
the 
expedition 
of 
Alexander 
into 
Asia, 
which 
at 
first 
was 
prejudged 
as 
a 
vast 
and 
impossible 
enterprise; 
and 
yet 
afterwards 
it 
pleaseth 
Livy 
to 
make 
no 
more 
of 
it 
than 
this, 
Nil 
aliud 
quam 
bene 
ausus 
vana 
contemnere. 
And 
the 
same 
happened 
to 
Columbus 
in 
the 
western 
navigation. 
But 
in 
intellectual 
matters 
it 
is 
much 
more 
common, 
as 
may 
be 
seen 
in 
most 
of 
the 
propositions 
of 
Euclid; 
which 
till 
they 
be 
demonstrate, 
they 
seem 
strange 
to 
our 
assent; 
but 
being 
demonstrate, 
our 
mind 
accepteth 
of 
them 
by 
a 
kind 
of 
relation 
(as 
the 
lawyers 
speak), 
as 
if 
we 
had 
known 
them 
before. 

(3) 
Another 
error, 
that 
hath 
also 
some 
affinity 
with 
the 
former, 
is 
a 
conceit 
that 
of 
former 
opinions 
or 
sects 
after 
variety 
and 
examination 
the 
best 
hath 
still 
prevailed 
and 
suppressed 
the 
rest; 
so 
as 
if 
a 
man 
should 
begin 
the 
labour 
of 
a 
new 
search, 
he 
were 
but 
like 
to 
light 
upon 
somewhat 
formerly 
rejected, 
and 
by 
rejection 
brought 
into 
oblivion; 
as 
if 
the 
multitude, 
or 
the 
wisest 
for 
the 
multitude’s 
sake, 
were 
not 
ready 
to 
give 
passage 
rather 
to 
that 
which 
is 
popular 
and 
superficial 
than 
to 
that 
which 
is 
substantial 
and 
profound 
for 
the 
truth 
is, 
that 
time 
seemeth 
to 
be 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
river 
or 
stream, 
which 
carrieth 
down 
to 
us 
that 
which 
is 
light 
and 
blown 
up, 
and 
sinketh 
and 
drowneth 
that 
which 
is 
weighty 
and 
solid. 
(4) 
Another 
error, 
of 
a 
diverse 
nature 
from 
all 
the 
former, 
is 
the 
over-
early 
and 
peremptory 
reduction 
of 
knowledge 
into 
arts 
and 
methods; 
from 
which 
time 
commonly 
sciences 
receive 
small 
or 
no 
augmentation. 
But 
as 
young 
men, 
when 
they 
knit 
and 
shape 
perfectly, 
do 
seldom 
grow 
to 
a 
further 
stature, 
so 
knowledge, 
while 
it 
is 
in 
aphorisms 
and 
observations, 
it 
is 
in 
growth; 
but 
when 
it 
once 
is 
comprehended 
in 
exact 
methods, 
it 
may, 
perchance, 
be 
further 
polished, 
and 
illustrate 
and 
accommodated 
for 
use 
and 
practice, 
but 
it 
increaseth 
no 
more 
in 
bulk 
and 
substance. 
(5) 
Another 
error 
which 
doth 
succeed 
that 
which 
we 
last 
mentioned 
is, 
that 
after 
the 
distribution 
of 
particular 
arts 
and 
sciences, 
men 
have 
abandoned 
universality, 
or 
philosophia 
prima, 
which 
cannot 
but 
cease 
and 
stop 
all 
progression. 
For 
no 
perfect 
discovery 
can 
be 
made 
upon 
a 
flat 
or 
a 
level; 
neither 
is 
it 
possible 
to 
discover 
the 
more 
remote 
and 
deeper 
parts 
of 
any 
science 
if 
you 
stand 
but 
upon 
the 
level 
of 
the 
same 
science, 
and 
ascend 
not 
to 
a 
higher 
science. 
(6) 
Another 
error 
hath 
proceeded 
from 
too 
great 
a 
reverence, 
and 
a 
kind 
of 
adoration 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
understanding 
of 
man; 
by 
means 
whereof, 
men 
have 
withdrawn 
themselves 
too 
much 
from 
the 
contemplation 
of 
nature, 
and 
the 
observations 
of 
experience, 
and 
have 
tumbled 
up 
and 
down 
in 
their 
own 
reason 
and 
conceits. 
Upon 
these 
intellectualists, 
which 
are 
notwithstanding 
commonly 
taken 
for 
the 
most 
sublime 
and 
divine 
philosophers, 
Heraclitus 
gave 
a 
just 
censure, 
saying: 
—“Men 
sought 
truth 
in 
their 
own 
little 
worlds, 
and 
not 
in 
the 
great 
and 
common 
world;” 
for 
they 
disdain 
to 
spell, 
and 
so 
by 
degrees 
to 
read 
in 
the 
volume 
of 
God’s 
works; 
and 
contrariwise 
by 
continual 
meditation 
and 
agitation 
of 
wit 
do 
urge 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
invocate 
their 
own 
spirits 
to 
divine 
and 
give 
oracles 
unto 
them, 

whereby 
they 
are 
deservedly 
deluded. 


(7) 
Another 
error 
that 
hath 
some 
connection 
with 
this 
latter 
is, 
that 
men 
have 
used 
to 
infect 
their 
meditations, 
opinions, 
and 
doctrines 
with 
some 
conceits 
which 
they 
have 
most 
admired, 
or 
some 
sciences 
which 
they 
have 
most 
applied, 
and 
given 
all 
things 
else 
a 
tincture 
according 
to 
them, 
utterly 
untrue 
and 
improper. 
So 
hath 
Plato 
intermingled 
his 
philosophy 
with 
theology, 
and 
Aristotle 
with 
logic; 
and 
the 
second 
school 
of 
Plato, 
Proclus 
and 
the 
rest, 
with 
the 
mathematics; 
for 
these 
were 
the 
arts 
which 
had 
a 
kind 
of 
primogeniture 
with 
them 
severally. 
So 
have 
the 
alchemists 
made 
a 
philosophy 
out 
of 
a 
few 
experiments 
of 
the 
furnace; 
and 
Gilbertus 
our 
countryman 
hath 
made 
a 
philosophy 
out 
of 
the 
observations 
of 
a 
loadstone. 
So 
Cicero, 
when 
reciting 
the 
several 
opinions 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
soul, 
he 
found 
a 
musician 
that 
held 
the 
soul 
was 
but 
a 
harmony, 
saith 
pleasantly, 
Hic 
ab 
arte 
sua 
non 
recessit, 
&c. 
But 
of 
these 
conceits 
Aristotle 
speaketh 
seriously 
and 
wisely 
when 
he 
saith, 
Qui 
respiciunt 
ad 
pauca 
de 
facili 
pronunciant. 
(8) 
Another 
error 
is 
an 
impatience 
of 
doubt, 
and 
haste 
to 
assertion 
without 
due 
and 
mature 
suspension 
of 
judgment. 
For 
the 
two 
ways 
of 
contemplation 
are 
not 
unlike 
the 
two 
ways 
of 
action 
commonly 
spoken 
of 
by 
the 
ancients: 
the 
one 
plain 
and 
smooth 
in 
the 
beginning, 
and 
in 
the 
end 
impassable; 
the 
other 
rough 
and 
troublesome 
in 
the 
entrance, 
but 
after 
a 
while 
fair 
and 
even. 
So 
it 
is 
in 
contemplation: 
if 
a 
man 
will 
begin 
with 
certainties, 
he 
shall 
end 
in 
doubts; 
but 
if 
he 
will 
be 
content 
to 
begin 
with 
doubts, 
he 
shall 
end 
in 
certainties. 
(9) 
Another 
error 
is 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
the 
tradition 
and 
delivery 
of 
knowledge, 
which 
is 
for 
the 
most 
part 
magistral 
and 
peremptory, 
and 
not 
ingenuous 
and 
faithful; 
in 
a 
sort 
as 
may 
be 
soonest 
believed, 
and 
not 
easiest 
examined. 
It 
is 
true, 
that 
in 
compendious 
treatises 
for 
practice 
that 
form 
is 
not 
to 
be 
disallowed; 
but 
in 
the 
true 
handling 
of 
knowledge 
men 
ought 
not 
to 
fall 
either 
on 
the 
one 
side 
into 
the 
vein 
of 
Velleius 
the 
Epicurean, 
Nil 
tam 
metuens 
quam 
ne 
dubitare 
aliqua 
de 
revideretur: 
nor, 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
into 
Socrates, 
his 
ironical 
doubting 
of 
all 
things; 
but 
to 
propound 
things 
sincerely 
with 
more 
or 
less 
asseveration, 
as 
they 
stand 
in 
a 
man’s 
own 
judgment 
proved 
more 
or 
less. 
(10) 
Other 
errors 
there 
are 
in 
the 
scope 
that 
men 
propound 
to 

themselves, 
whereunto 
they 
bend 
their 
endeavours; 
for, 
whereas 
the 
more 
constant 
and 
devote 
kind 
of 
professors 
of 
any 
science 
ought 
to 
propound 
to 
themselves 
to 
make 
some 
additions 
to 
their 
science, 
they 
convert 
their 
labours 
to 
aspire 
to 
certain 
second 
prizes: 
as 
to 
be 
a 
profound 
interpreter 
or 
commentor, 
to 
be 
a 
sharp 
champion 
or 
defender, 
to 
be 
a 
methodical 
compounder 
or 
abridger, 
and 
so 
the 
patrimony 
of 
knowledge 
cometh 
to 
be 
sometimes 
improved, 
but 
seldom 
augmented. 


(11) 
But 
the 
greatest 
error 
of 
all 
the 
rest 
is 
the 
mistaking 
or 
misplacing 
of 
the 
last 
or 
furthest 
end 
of 
knowledge. 
For 
men 
have 
entered 
into 
a 
desire 
of 
learning 
and 
knowledge, 
sometimes 
upon 
a 
natural 
curiosity 
and 
inquisitive 
appetite; 
sometimes 
to 
entertain 
their 
minds 
with 
variety 
and 
delight; 
sometimes 
for 
ornament 
and 
reputation; 
and 
sometimes 
to 
enable 
them 
to 
victory 
of 
wit 
and 
contradiction; 
and 
most 
times 
for 
lucre 
and 
profession; 
and 
seldom 
sincerely 
to 
give 
a 
true 
account 
of 
their 
gift 
of 
reason 
to 
the 
benefit 
and 
use 
of 
men: 
as 
if 
there 
were 
sought 
in 
knowledge 
a 
couch 
whereupon 
to 
rest 
a 
searching 
and 
restless 
spirit; 
or 
a 
terrace 
for 
a 
wandering 
and 
variable 
mind 
to 
walk 
up 
and 
down 
with 
a 
fair 
prospect; 
or 
a 
tower 
of 
state, 
for 
a 
proud 
mind 
to 
raise 
itself 
upon; 
or 
a 
fort 
or 
commanding 
ground, 
for 
strife 
and 
contention; 
or 
a 
shop, 
for 
profit 
or 
sale; 
and 
not 
a 
rich 
storehouse 
for 
the 
glory 
of 
the 
Creator 
and 
the 
relief 
of 
man’s 
estate. 
But 
this 
is 
that 
which 
will 
indeed 
dignify 
and 
exalt 
knowledge, 
if 
contemplation 
and 
action 
may 
be 
more 
nearly 
and 
straitly 
conjoined 
and 
united 
together 
than 
they 
have 
been: 
a 
conjunction 
like 
unto 
that 
of 
the 
two 
highest 
planets, 
Saturn, 
the 
planet 
of 
rest 
and 
contemplation; 
and 
Jupiter, 
the 
planet 
of 
civil 
society 
and 
action, 
howbeit, 
I 
do 
not 
mean, 
when 
I 
speak 
of 
use 
and 
action, 
that 
end 
before-mentioned 
of 
the 
applying 
of 
knowledge 
to 
lucre 
and 
profession; 
for 
I 
am 
not 
ignorant 
how 
much 
that 
diverteth 
and 
interrupteth 
the 
prosecution 
and 
advancement 
of 
knowledge, 
like 
unto 
the 
golden 
ball 
thrown 
before 
Atalanta, 
which, 
while 
she 
goeth 
aside 
and 
stoopeth 
to 
take 
up, 
the 
race 
is 
hindered, 
“Declinat 
cursus, 
aurumque 
volubile 
tollit.” 
† 


† 
Stoops 
in 
the 
rice 
and 
takes 
the 
speeding 
gold. 
Ovid. 
Metam, 
x. 
667. 
Neither 
is 
my 
meaning, 
as 
was 
spoken 
of 
Socrates, 
to 
call 
philosophy 
down 
from 
heaven 
to 
converse 
upon 
the 
earth 
— 
that 
is, 
to 
leave 



natural 
philosophy 
aside, 
and 
to 
apply 
knowledge 
only 
to 
manners 
and 
policy. 
But 
as 
both 
heaven 
and 
earth 
do 
conspire 
and 
contribute 
to 
the 
use 
and 
benefit 
of 
man, 
so 
the 
end 
ought 
to 
be, 
from 
both 
philosophies 
to 
separate 
and 
reject 
vain 
speculations, 
and 
whatsoever 
is 
empty 
and 
void, 
and 
to 
preserve 
and 
augment 
whatsoever 
is 
solid 
and 
fruitful; 
that 
knowledge 
may 
not 
be 
as 
a 
courtesan, 
for 
pleasure 
and 
vanity 
only, 
or 
as 
a 
bond-woman, 
to 
acquire 
and 
gain 
to 
her 
master’s 
use; 
but 
as 
a 
spouse, 
for 
generation, 
fruit, 
and 
comfort. 


(12) 
Thus 
have 
I 
described 
and 
opened, 
as 
by 
a 
kind 
of 
dissection, 
those 
peccant 
humours 
(the 
principal 
of 
them) 
which 
have 
not 
only 
given 
impediment 
to 
the 
proficience 
of 
learning, 
but 
have 
given 
also 
occasion 
to 
the 
traducement 
thereof: 
wherein, 
if 
I 
have 
been 
too 
plain, 
it 
must 
be 
remembered, 
fidelia 
vulnera 
amantis, 
sed 
dolosa 
oscula 
malignantis. 
This 
I 
think 
I 
have 
gained, 
that 
I 
ought 
to 
be 
the 
better 
believed 
in 
that 
which 
I 
shall 
say 
pertaining 
to 
commendation; 
because 
I 
have 
proceeded 
so 
freely 
in 
that 
which 
concerneth 
censure. 
And 
yet 
I 
have 
no 
purpose 
to 
enter 
into 
a 
laudative 
of 
learning, 
or 
to 
make 
a 
hymn 
to 
the 
Muses 
(though 
I 
am 
of 
opinion 
that 
it 
is 
long 
since 
their 
rites 
were 
duly 
celebrated), 
but 
my 
intent 
is, 
without 
varnish 
or 
amplification 
justly 
to 
weigh 
the 
dignity 
of 
knowledge 
in 
the 
balance 
with 
other 
things, 
and 
to 
take 
the 
true 
value 
thereof 
by 
testimonies 
and 
arguments, 
divine 
and 
human. 

VI 


(1) 
First, 
therefore, 
let 
us 
seek 
the 
dignity 
of 
knowledge 
in 
the 
archetype 
or 
first 
platform, 
which 
is 
in 
the 
attributes 
and 
acts 
of 
God, 
as 
far 
as 
they 
are 
revealed 
to 
man 
and 
may 
be 
observed 
with 
sobriety; 
wherein 
we 
may 
not 
seek 
it 
by 
the 
name 
of 
learning, 
for 
all 
learning 
is 
knowledge 
acquired, 
and 
all 
knowledge 
in 
God 
is 
original, 
and 
therefore 
we 
must 
look 
for 
it 
by 
another 
name, 
that 
of 
wisdom 
or 
sapience, 
as 
the 
Scriptures 
call 
it. 
(2) 
It 
is 
so, 
then, 
that 
in 
the 
work 
of 
the 
creation 
we 
see 
a 
double 
emanation 
of 
virtue 
from 
God; 
the 
one 
referring 
more 
properly 
to 
power, 
the 
other 
to 
wisdom; 
the 
one 
expressed 
in 
making 
the 
subsistence 
of 
the 
matter, 
and 
the 
other 
in 
disposing 
the 
beauty 
of 
the 
form. 
This 
being 
supposed, 
it 
is 
to 
be 
observed 
that 
for 
anything 
which 
appeareth 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
creation, 
the 
confused 
mass 
and 
matter 
of 
heaven 
and 
earth 
was 
made 
in 
a 
moment, 
and 
the 
order 
and 
disposition 
of 
that 
chaos 
or 
mass 
was 
the 
work 
of 
six 
days; 
such 
a 
note 
of 
difference 
it 
pleased 
God 
to 
put 
upon 
the 
works 
of 
power, 
and 
the 
works 
of 
wisdom; 
wherewith 
concurreth, 
that 
in 
the 
former 
it 
is 
not 
set 
down 
that 
God 
said, 
“Let 
there 
be 
heaven 
and 
earth,” 
as 
it 
is 
set 
down 
of 
the 
works 
following; 
but 
actually, 
that 
God 
made 
heaven 
and 
earth: 
the 
one 
carrying 
the 
style 
of 
a 
manufacture, 
and 
the 
other 
of 
a 
law, 
decree, 
or 
counsel. 
(3) 
To 
proceed, 
to 
that 
which 
is 
next 
in 
order 
from 
God, 
to 
spirits: 
we 
find, 
as 
far 
as 
credit 
is 
to 
be 
given 
to 
the 
celestial 
hierarchy 
of 
that 
supposed 
Dionysius, 
the 
senator 
of 
Athens, 
the 
first 
place 
or 
degree 
is 
given 
to 
the 
angels 
of 
love, 
which 
are 
termed 
seraphim; 
the 
second 
to 
the 
angels 
of 
light, 
which 
are 
termed 
cherubim; 
and 
the 
third, 
and 
so 
following 
places, 
to 
thrones, 
principalities, 
and 
the 
rest, 
which 
are 
all 
angels 
of 
power 
and 
ministry; 
so 
as 
this 
angels 
of 
knowledge 
and 
illumination 
are 
placed 
before 
the 
angels 
of 
office 
and 
domination. 
(4) 
To 
descend 
from 
spirits 
and 
intellectual 
forms 
to 
sensible 
and 
material 
forms, 
we 
read 
the 
first 
form 
that 
was 
created 
was 
light, 
which 
hath 
a 
relation 
and 
correspondence 
in 
nature 
and 
corporal 
things 
to 
knowledge 
in 
spirits 
and 
incorporal 
things. 
(5) 
So 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
days 
we 
see 
the 
day 
wherein 
God 
did 

rest 
and 
contemplate 
His 
own 
works 
was 
blessed 
above 
all 
the 
days 
wherein 
He 
did 
effect 
and 
accomplish 
them. 


(6) 
After 
the 
creation 
was 
finished, 
it 
is 
set 
down 
unto 
us 
that 
man 
was 
placed 
in 
the 
garden 
to 
work 
therein; 
which 
work, 
so 
appointed 
to 
him, 
could 
be 
no 
other 
than 
work 
of 
contemplation; 
that 
is, 
when 
the 
end 
of 
work 
is 
but 
for 
exercise 
and 
experiment, 
not 
for 
necessity; 
for 
there 
being 
then 
no 
reluctation 
of 
the 
creature, 
nor 
sweat 
of 
the 
brow, 
man’s 
employment 
must 
of 
consequence 
have 
been 
matter 
of 
delight 
in 
the 
experiment, 
and 
not 
matter 
of 
labour 
for 
the 
use. 
Again, 
the 
first 
acts 
which 
man 
performed 
in 
Paradise 
consisted 
of 
the 
two 
summary 
parts 
of 
knowledge; 
the 
view 
of 
creatures, 
and 
the 
imposition 
of 
names. 
As 
for 
the 
knowledge 
which 
induced 
the 
fall, 
it 
was, 
as 
was 
touched 
before, 
not 
the 
natural 
knowledge 
of 
creatures, 
but 
the 
moral 
knowledge 
of 
good 
and 
evil; 
wherein 
the 
supposition 
was, 
that 
God’s 
commandments 
or 
prohibitions 
were 
not 
the 
originals 
of 
good 
and 
evil, 
but 
that 
they 
had 
other 
beginnings, 
which 
man 
aspired 
to 
know, 
to 
the 
end 
to 
make 
a 
total 
defection 
from 
God 
and 
to 
depend 
wholly 
upon 
himself. 
(7) 
To 
pass 
on: 
in 
the 
first 
event 
or 
occurrence 
after 
the 
fall 
of 
man, 
we 
see 
(as 
the 
Scriptures 
have 
infinite 
mysteries, 
not 
violating 
at 
all 
the 
truth 
of 
this 
story 
or 
letter) 
an 
image 
of 
the 
two 
estates, 
the 
contemplative 
state 
and 
the 
active 
state, 
figured 
in 
the 
two 
persons 
of 
Abel 
and 
Cain, 
and 
in 
the 
two 
simplest 
and 
most 
primitive 
trades 
of 
life; 
that 
of 
the 
shepherd 
(who, 
by 
reason 
of 
his 
leisure, 
rest 
in 
a 
place, 
and 
lying 
in 
view 
of 
heaven, 
is 
a 
lively 
image 
of 
a 
contemplative 
life), 
and 
that 
of 
the 
husbandman, 
where 
we 
see 
again 
the 
favour 
and 
election 
of 
God 
went 
to 
the 
shepherd, 
and 
not 
to 
the 
tiller 
of 
the 
ground. 
(8) 
So 
in 
the 
age 
before 
the 
flood, 
the 
holy 
records 
within 
those 
few 
memorials 
which 
are 
there 
entered 
and 
registered 
have 
vouchsafed 
to 
mention 
and 
honour 
the 
name 
of 
the 
inventors 
and 
authors 
of 
music 
and 
works 
in 
metal. 
In 
the 
age 
after 
the 
flood, 
the 
first 
great 
judgment 
of 
God 
upon 
the 
ambition 
of 
man 
was 
the 
confusion 
of 
tongues; 
whereby 
the 
open 
trade 
and 
intercourse 
of 
learning 
and 
knowledge 
was 
chiefly 
imbarred. 
(9) 
To 
descend 
to 
Moses 
the 
lawgiver, 
and 
God’s 
first 
pen: 
he 
is 
adorned 
by 
the 
Scriptures 
with 
this 
addition 
and 
commendation, 
“That 
he 
was 
seen 
in 
all 
the 
learning 
of 
the 
Egyptians,” 
which 
nation 
we 
know 
was 
one 
of 
the 
most 
ancient 
schools 
of 
the 
world: 
for 
so 
Plato 
brings 
in 
the 
Egyptian 

priest 
saying 
unto 
Solon, 
“You 
Grecians 
are 
ever 
children; 
you 
have 
no 
knowledge 
of 
antiquity, 
nor 
antiquity 
of 
knowledge.” 
Take 
a 
view 
of 
the 
ceremonial 
law 
of 
Moses; 
you 
shall 
find, 
besides 
the 
prefiguration 
of 
Christ, 
the 
badge 
or 
difference 
of 
the 
people 
of 
God, 
the 
exercise 
and 
impression 
of 
obedience, 
and 
other 
divine 
uses 
and 
fruits 
thereof, 
that 
some 
of 
the 
most 
learned 
Rabbins 
have 
travailed 
profitably 
and 
profoundly 
to 
observe, 
some 
of 
them 
a 
natural, 
some 
of 
them 
a 
moral 
sense, 
or 
reduction 
of 
many 
of 
the 
ceremonies 
and 
ordinances. 
As 
in 
the 
law 
of 
the 
leprosy, 
where 
it 
is 
said, 
“If 
the 
whiteness 
have 
overspread 
the 
flesh, 
the 
patient 
may 
pass 
abroad 
for 
clean; 
but 
if 
there 
be 
any 
whole 
flesh 
remaining, 
he 
is 
to 
be 
shut 
up 
for 
unclean;” 
one 
of 
them 
noteth 
a 
principle 
of 
nature, 
that 
putrefaction 
is 
more 
contagious 
before 
maturity 
than 
after; 
and 
another 
noteth 
a 
position 
of 
moral 
philosophy, 
that 
men 
abandoned 
to 
vice 
do 
not 
so 
much 
corrupt 
manners, 
as 
those 
that 
are 
half 
good 
and 
half 
evil. 
So 
in 
this 
and 
very 
many 
other 
places 
in 
that 
law, 
there 
is 
to 
be 
found, 
besides 
the 
theological 
sense, 
much 
aspersion 
of 
philosophy. 


(10) 
So 
likewise 
in 
that 
excellent 
hook 
of 
Job, 
if 
it 
be 
revolved 
with 
diligence, 
it 
will 
be 
found 
pregnant 
and 
swelling 
with 
natural 
philosophy; 
as 
for 
example, 
cosmography, 
and 
the 
roundness 
of 
the 
world, 
Qui 
extendit 
aquilonem 
super 
vacuum, 
et 
appendit 
terram 
super 
nihilum; 
wherein 
the 
pensileness 
of 
the 
earth, 
the 
pole 
of 
the 
north, 
and 
the 
finiteness 
or 
convexity 
of 
heaven 
are 
manifestly 
touched. 
So 
again, 
matter 
of 
astronomy: 
Spiritus 
ejus 
ornavit 
caelos, 
et 
obstetricante 
manu 
ejus 
eductus 
est 
Coluber 
tortuoses. 
And 
in 
another 
place, 
Nunquid 
conjungere 
valebis 
micantes 
stellas 
Pleiadas, 
aut 
gyrum 
Arcturi 
poteris 
dissipare? 
Where 
the 
fixing 
of 
the 
stars, 
ever 
standing 
at 
equal 
distance, 
is 
with 
great 
elegancy 
noted. 
And 
in 
another 
place, 
Qui 
facit 
Arcturum, 
et 
Oriona, 
et 
Hyadas, 
et 
interiora 
Austri; 
where 
again 
he 
takes 
knowledge 
of 
the 
depression 
of 
the 
southern 
pole, 
calling 
it 
the 
secrets 
of 
the 
south, 
because 
the 
southern 
stars 
were 
in 
that 
climate 
unseen. 
Matter 
of 
generation: 
Annon 
sicut 
lac 
mulsisti 
me, 
et 
sicut 
caseum 
coagulasti 
me? 
&c. 
Matter 
of 
minerals: 
Habet 
argentum 
venarum 
suarum 
principia; 
et 
auro 
locus 
est 
in 
quo 
conflatur, 
ferrum 
de 
terra 
tollitur, 
et 
lapis 
solutus 
calore 
in 
aes 
vertitur; 
and 
so 
forwards 
in 
that 
chapter. 
(11) 
So 
likewise 
in 
the 
person 
of 
Solomon 
the 
king, 
we 
see 
the 
gift 
or 
endowment 
of 
wisdom 
and 
learning, 
both 
in 
Solomon’s 
petition 
and 
in 
God’s 
assent 
thereunto, 
preferred 
before 
all 
other 
terrene 
and 
temporal 

felicity. 
By 
virtue 
of 
which 
grant 
or 
donative 
of 
God 
Solomon 
became 
enabled 
not 
only 
to 
write 
those 
excellent 
parables 
or 
aphorisms 
concerning 
divine 
and 
moral 
philosophy, 
but 
also 
to 
compile 
a 
natural 
history 
of 
all 
verdure, 
from 
the 
cedar 
upon 
the 
mountain 
to 
the 
moss 
upon 
the 
wall 
(which 
is 
but 
a 
rudiment 
between 
putrefaction 
and 
an 
herb), 
and 
also 
of 
all 
things 
that 
breathe 
or 
move. 
Nay, 
the 
same 
Solomon 
the 
king, 
although 
he 
excelled 
in 
the 
glory 
of 
treasure 
and 
magnificent 
buildings, 
of 
shipping 
and 
navigation, 
of 
service 
and 
attendance, 
of 
fame 
and 
renown, 
and 
the 
like, 
yet 
he 
maketh 
no 
claim 
to 
any 
of 
those 
glories, 
but 
only 
to 
the 
glory 
of 
inquisition 
of 
truth; 
for 
so 
he 
saith 
expressly, 
“The 
glory 
of 
God 
is 
to 
conceal 
a 
thing, 
but 
the 
glory 
of 
the 
king 
is 
to 
find 
it 
out;” 
as 
if, 
according 
to 
the 
innocent 
play 
of 
children, 
the 
Divine 
Majesty 
took 
delight 
to 
hide 
His 
works, 
to 
the 
end 
to 
have 
them 
found 
out; 
and 
as 
if 
kings 
could 
not 
obtain 
a 
greater 
honour 
than 
to 
be 
God’s 
playfellows 
in 
that 
game; 
considering 
the 
great 
commandment 
of 
wits 
and 
means, 
whereby 
nothing 
needeth 
to 
be 
hidden 
from 
them. 


(12) 
Neither 
did 
the 
dispensation 
of 
God 
vary 
in 
the 
times 
after 
our 
Saviour 
came 
into 
the 
world; 
for 
our 
Saviour 
himself 
did 
first 
show 
His 
power 
to 
subdue 
ignorance, 
by 
His 
conference 
with 
the 
priests 
and 
doctors 
of 
the 
law, 
before 
He 
showed 
His 
power 
to 
subdue 
nature 
by 
His 
miracles. 
And 
the 
coming 
of 
this 
Holy 
Spirit 
was 
chiefly 
figured 
and 
expressed 
in 
the 
similitude 
and 
gift 
of 
tongues, 
which 
are 
but 
vehicula 
scientiae. 
(13) 
So 
in 
the 
election 
of 
those 
instruments, 
which 
it 
pleased 
God 
to 
use 
for 
the 
plantation 
of 
the 
faith, 
notwithstanding 
that 
at 
the 
first 
He 
did 
employ 
persons 
altogether 
unlearned, 
otherwise 
than 
by 
inspiration, 
more 
evidently 
to 
declare 
His 
immediate 
working, 
and 
to 
abase 
all 
human 
wisdom 
or 
knowledge; 
yet 
nevertheless 
that 
counsel 
of 
His 
was 
no 
sooner 
performed, 
but 
in 
the 
next 
vicissitude 
and 
succession 
He 
did 
send 
His 
divine 
truth 
into 
the 
world, 
waited 
on 
with 
other 
learnings, 
as 
with 
servants 
or 
handmaids: 
for 
so 
we 
see 
St. 
Paul, 
who 
was 
only 
learned 
amongst 
the 
Apostles, 
had 
his 
pen 
most 
used 
in 
the 
Scriptures 
of 
the 
New 
Testament. 
(14) 
So 
again 
we 
find 
that 
many 
of 
the 
ancient 
bishops 
and 
fathers 
of 
the 
Church 
were 
excellently 
read 
and 
studied 
in 
all 
the 
learning 
of 
this 
heathen; 
insomuch 
that 
the 
edict 
of 
the 
Emperor 
Julianus 
(whereby 
it 
was 
interdicted 
unto 
Christians 
to 
be 
admitted 
into 
schools, 
lectures, 
or 
exercises 
of 
learning) 
was 
esteemed 
and 
accounted 
a 
more 
pernicious 
engine 
and 

machination 
against 
the 
Christian 
Faith 
than 
were 
all 
the 
sanguinary 
prosecutions 
of 
his 
predecessors; 
neither 
could 
the 
emulation 
and 
jealousy 
of 
Gregory, 
the 
first 
of 
that 
name, 
Bishop 
of 
Rome, 
ever 
obtain 
the 
opinion 
of 
piety 
or 
devotion; 
but 
contrariwise 
received 
the 
censure 
of 
humour, 
malignity, 
and 
pusillanimity, 
even 
amongst 
holy 
men; 
in 
that 
he 
designed 
to 
obliterate 
and 
extinguish 
the 
memory 
of 
heathen 
antiquity 
and 
authors. 
But 
contrariwise 
it 
was 
the 
Christian 
Church, 
which, 
amidst 
the 
inundations 
of 
the 
Scythians 
on 
the 
one 
side 
from 
the 
north-west, 
and 
the 
Saracens 
from 
the 
east, 
did 
preserve 
in 
the 
sacred 
lap 
and 
bosom 
thereof 
the 
precious 
relics 
even 
of 
heathen 
learning, 
which 
otherwise 
had 
been 
extinguished, 
as 
if 
no 
such 
thing 
had 
ever 
been. 


(15) 
And 
we 
see 
before 
our 
eyes, 
that 
in 
the 
age 
of 
ourselves 
and 
our 
fathers, 
when 
it 
pleased 
God 
to 
call 
the 
Church 
of 
Rome 
to 
account 
for 
their 
degenerate 
manners 
and 
ceremonies, 
and 
sundry 
doctrines 
obnoxious 
and 
framed 
to 
uphold 
the 
same 
abuses; 
at 
one 
and 
the 
same 
time 
it 
was 
ordained 
by 
the 
Divine 
Providence 
that 
there 
should 
attend 
withal 
a 
renovation 
and 
new 
spring 
of 
all 
other 
knowledges. 
And 
on 
the 
other 
side 
we 
see 
the 
Jesuits, 
who 
partly 
in 
themselves, 
and 
partly 
by 
the 
emulation 
and 
provocation 
of 
their 
example, 
have 
much 
quickened 
and 
strengthened 
the 
state 
of 
learning; 
we 
see 
(I 
say) 
what 
notable 
service 
and 
reparation 
they 
have 
done 
to 
the 
Roman 
see. 
(16) 
Wherefore, 
to 
conclude 
this 
part, 
let 
it 
be 
observed, 
that 
there 
be 
two 
principal 
duties 
and 
services, 
besides 
ornament 
and 
illustration, 
which 
philosophy 
and 
human 
learning 
do 
perform 
to 
faith 
and 
religion. 
The 
one, 
because 
they 
are 
an 
effectual 
inducement 
to 
the 
exaltation 
of 
the 
glory 
of 
God. 
For 
as 
the 
Psalms 
and 
other 
Scriptures 
do 
often 
invite 
us 
to 
consider 
and 
magnify 
the 
great 
and 
wonderful 
works 
of 
God, 
so 
if 
we 
should 
rest 
only 
in 
the 
contemplation 
of 
the 
exterior 
of 
them 
as 
they 
first 
offer 
themselves 
to 
our 
senses, 
we 
should 
do 
a 
like 
injury 
unto 
the 
majesty 
of 
God, 
as 
if 
we 
should 
judge 
or 
construe 
of 
the 
store 
of 
some 
excellent 
jeweller 
by 
that 
only 
which 
is 
set 
out 
toward 
the 
street 
in 
his 
shop. 
The 
other, 
because 
they 
minister 
a 
singular 
help 
and 
preservative 
against 
unbelief 
and 
error. 
For 
our 
Saviour 
saith, 
“You 
err, 
not 
knowing 
the 
Scriptures, 
nor 
the 
power 
of 
God;” 
laying 
before 
us 
two 
books 
or 
volumes 
to 
study, 
if 
we 
will 
be 
secured 
from 
error: 
first 
the 
Scriptures, 
revealing 
the 
will 
of 
God, 
and 
then 
the 
creatures 
expressing 
His 
power; 
whereof 
the 
latter 
is 
a 
key 
unto 
the 
former: 
not 
only 

opening 
our 
understanding 
to 
conceive 
the 
true 
sense 
of 
the 
Scriptures 
by 
the 
general 
notions 
of 
reason 
and 
rules 
of 
speech, 
but 
chiefly 
opening 
our 
belief, 
in 
drawing 
us 
into 
a 
due 
meditation 
of 
the 
omnipotency 
of 
God, 
which 
is 
chiefly 
signed 
and 
engraven 
upon 
His 
works. 
Thus 
much 
therefore 
for 
divine 
testimony 
and 
evidence 
concerning 
the 
true 
dignity 
and 
value 
of 
learning. 



VII 


(1) 
As 
for 
human 
proofs, 
it 
is 
so 
large 
a 
field, 
as 
in 
a 
discourse 
of 
this 
nature 
and 
brevity 
it 
is 
fit 
rather 
to 
use 
choice 
of 
those 
things 
which 
we 
shall 
produce, 
than 
to 
embrace 
the 
variety 
of 
them. 
First, 
therefore, 
in 
the 
degrees 
of 
human 
honour 
amongst 
the 
heathen, 
it 
was 
the 
highest 
to 
obtain 
to 
a 
veneration 
and 
adoration 
as 
a 
God. 
This 
unto 
the 
Christians 
is 
as 
the 
forbidden 
fruit. 
But 
we 
speak 
now 
separately 
of 
human 
testimony, 
according 
to 
which 
— 
that 
which 
the 
Grecians 
call 
apotheosis, 
and 
the 
Latins 
relatio 
inter 
divos 
— 
was 
the 
supreme 
honour 
which 
man 
could 
attribute 
unto 
man, 
specially 
when 
it 
was 
given, 
not 
by 
a 
formal 
decree 
or 
act 
of 
state 
(as 
it 
was 
used 
among 
the 
Roman 
Emperors), 
but 
by 
an 
inward 
assent 
and 
belief. 
Which 
honour, 
being 
so 
high, 
had 
also 
a 
degree 
or 
middle 
term; 
for 
there 
were 
reckoned 
above 
human 
honours, 
honours 
heroical 
and 
divine: 
in 
the 
attribution 
and 
distribution 
of 
which 
honours 
we 
see 
antiquity 
made 
this 
difference; 
that 
whereas 
founders 
and 
uniters 
of 
states 
and 
cities, 
lawgivers, 
extirpers 
of 
tyrants, 
fathers 
of 
the 
people, 
and 
other 
eminent 
persons 
in 
civil 
merit, 
were 
honoured 
but 
with 
the 
titles 
of 
worthies 
or 
demigods, 
such 
as 
were 
Hercules, 
Theseus, 
Minus, 
Romulus, 
and 
the 
like; 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
such 
as 
were 
inventors 
and 
authors 
of 
new 
arts, 
endowments, 
and 
commodities 
towards 
man’s 
life, 
were 
ever 
consecrated 
amongst 
the 
gods 
themselves, 
as 
was 
Ceres, 
Bacchus, 
Mercurius, 
Apollo, 
and 
others. 
And 
justly; 
for 
the 
merit 
of 
the 
former 
is 
confined 
within 
the 
circle 
of 
an 
age 
or 
a 
nation, 
and 
is 
like 
fruitful 
showers, 
which 
though 
they 
be 
profitable 
and 
good, 
yet 
serve 
but 
for 
that 
season, 
and 
for 
a 
latitude 
of 
ground 
where 
they 
fall; 
but 
the 
other 
is, 
indeed, 
like 
the 
benefits 
of 
heaven, 
which 
are 
permanent 
and 
universal. 
The 
former 
again 
is 
mixed 
with 
strife 
and 
perturbation, 
but 
the 
latter 
hath 
the 
true 
character 
of 
Divine 
Presence, 
coming 
in 
aura 
leni, 
without 
noise 
or 
agitation. 
(2) 
Neither 
is 
certainly 
that 
other 
merit 
of 
learning, 
in 
repressing 
the 
inconveniences 
which 
grow 
from 
man 
to 
man, 
much 
inferior 
to 
the 
former, 
of 
relieving 
the 
necessities 
which 
arise 
from 
nature, 
which 
merit 
was 
lively 
set 
forth 
by 
the 
ancients 
in 
that 
feigned 
relation 
of 
Orpheus’ 
theatre, 
where 
all 
beasts 
and 
birds 
assembled, 
and, 
forgetting 
their 
several 
appetites 
— 
some 
of 

prey, 
some 
of 
game, 
some 
of 
quarrel 
— 
stood 
all 
sociably 
together 
listening 
unto 
the 
airs 
and 
accords 
of 
the 
harp, 
the 
sound 
whereof 
no 
sooner 
ceased, 
or 
was 
drowned 
by 
some 
louder 
noise, 
but 
every 
beast 
returned 
to 
his 
own 
nature; 
wherein 
is 
aptly 
described 
the 
nature 
and 
condition 
of 
men, 
who 
are 
full 
of 
savage 
and 
unreclaimed 
desires, 
of 
profit, 
of 
lust, 
of 
revenge; 
which 
as 
long 
as 
they 
give 
ear 
to 
precepts, 
to 
laws, 
to 
religion, 
sweetly 
touched 
with 
eloquence 
and 
persuasion 
of 
books, 
of 
sermons, 
of 
harangues, 
so 
long 
is 
society 
and 
peace 
maintained; 
but 
if 
these 
instruments 
be 
silent, 
or 
that 
sedition 
and 
tumult 
make 
them 
not 
audible, 
all 
things 
dissolve 
into 
anarchy 
and 
confusion. 


(3) 
But 
this 
appeareth 
more 
manifestly 
when 
kings 
themselves, 
or 
persons 
of 
authority 
under 
them, 
or 
other 
governors 
in 
commonwealths 
and 
popular 
estates, 
are 
endued 
with 
learning. 
For 
although 
he 
might 
be 
thought 
partial 
to 
his 
own 
profession 
that 
said 
“Then 
should 
people 
and 
estates 
be 
happy 
when 
either 
kings 
were 
philosophers, 
or 
philosophers 
kings;” 
yet 
so 
much 
is 
verified 
by 
experience, 
that 
under 
learned 
princes 
and 
governors 
there 
have 
been 
ever 
the 
best 
times: 
for 
howsoever 
kings 
may 
have 
their 
imperfections 
in 
their 
passions 
and 
customs, 
yet, 
if 
they 
be 
illuminate 
by 
learning, 
they 
have 
those 
notions 
of 
religion, 
policy, 
and 
morality, 
which 
do 
preserve 
them 
and 
refrain 
them 
from 
all 
ruinous 
and 
peremptory 
errors 
and 
excesses, 
whispering 
evermore 
in 
their 
ears, 
when 
counsellors 
and 
servants 
stand 
mute 
and 
silent. 
And 
senators 
or 
counsellors, 
likewise, 
which 
be 
learned, 
to 
proceed 
upon 
more 
safe 
and 
substantial 
principles, 
than 
counsellors 
which 
are 
only 
men 
of 
experience; 
the 
one 
sort 
keeping 
dangers 
afar 
off, 
whereas 
the 
other 
discover 
them 
not 
till 
they 
come 
near 
hand, 
and 
then 
trust 
to 
the 
agility 
of 
their 
wit 
to 
ward 
or 
avoid 
them. 
(4) 
Which 
felicity 
of 
times 
under 
learned 
princes 
(to 
keep 
still 
the 
law 
of 
brevity, 
by 
using 
the 
most 
eminent 
and 
selected 
examples) 
doth 
best 
appear 
in 
the 
age 
which 
passed 
from 
the 
death 
of 
Domitianus 
the 
emperor 
until 
the 
reign 
of 
Commodus; 
comprehending 
a 
succession 
of 
six 
princes, 
all 
learned, 
or 
singular 
favourers 
and 
advancers 
of 
learning, 
which 
age 
for 
temporal 
respects 
was 
the 
most 
happy 
and 
flourishing 
that 
ever 
the 
Roman 
Empire 
(which 
then 
was 
a 
model 
of 
the 
world) 
enjoyed 
— 
a 
matter 
revealed 
and 
prefigured 
unto 
Domitian 
in 
a 
dream 
the 
night 
before 
he 
was 
slain: 
for 
he 
thought 
there 
was 
grown 
behind 
upon 
his 
shoulders 
a 
neck 
and 
a 
head 
of 
gold, 
which 
came 
accordingly 
to 
pass 
in 
those 
golden 
times 
which 
succeeded; 

of 
which 
princes 
we 
will 
make 
some 
commemoration; 
wherein, 
although 
the 
matter 
will 
be 
vulgar, 
and 
may 
be 
thought 
fitter 
for 
a 
declamation 
than 
agreeable 
to 
a 
treatise 
infolded 
as 
this 
is, 
yet, 
because 
it 
is 
pertinent 
to 
the 
point 
in 
hand 
— 
Neque 
semper 
arcum 
tendit 
Apollo 
— 
and 
to 
name 
them 
only 
were 
too 
naked 
and 
cursory, 
I 
will 
not 
omit 
it 
altogether. 
The 
first 
was 
Nerva, 
the 
excellent 
temper 
of 
whose 
government 
is 
by 
a 
glance 
in 
Cornelius 
Tacitus 
touched 
to 
the 
life: 
Postquam 
divus 
Nerva 
res 
oluim 
insociabiles 
miscuisset, 
imperium 
et 
libertatem. 
And 
in 
token 
of 
his 
learning, 
the 
last 
act 
of 
his 
short 
reign 
left 
to 
memory 
was 
a 
missive 
to 
his 
adopted 
son, 
Trajan, 
proceeding 
upon 
some 
inward 
discontent 
at 
the 
ingratitude 
of 
the 
times, 
comprehended 
in 
a 
verse 
of 
Homer’s 
— 


“Telis, 
Phoebe, 
tuis, 
lacrymas 
ulciscere 
nostras.” 


(5) 
Trajan, 
who 
succeeded, 
was 
for 
his 
person 
not 
learned; 
but 
if 
we 
will 
hearken 
to 
the 
speech 
of 
our 
Saviour, 
that 
saith, 
“He 
that 
receiveth 
a 
prophet 
in 
the 
name 
of 
a 
prophet 
shall 
have 
a 
prophet’s 
reward,” 
he 
deserveth 
to 
be 
placed 
amongst 
the 
most 
learned 
princes; 
for 
there 
was 
not 
a 
greater 
admirer 
of 
learning 
or 
benefactor 
of 
learning, 
a 
founder 
of 
famous 
libraries, 
a 
perpetual 
advancer 
of 
learned 
men 
to 
office, 
and 
familiar 
converser 
with 
learned 
professors 
and 
preceptors 
who 
were 
noted 
to 
have 
then 
most 
credit 
in 
court. 
On 
the 
other 
side 
how 
much 
Trajan’s 
virtue 
and 
government 
was 
admired 
and 
renowned, 
surely 
no 
testimony 
of 
grave 
and 
faithful 
history 
doth 
more 
lively 
set 
forth 
than 
that 
legend 
tale 
of 
Gregorius 
Magnum, 
Bishop 
of 
Rome, 
who 
was 
noted 
for 
the 
extreme 
envy 
he 
bare 
towards 
all 
heathen 
excellency; 
and 
yet 
he 
is 
reported, 
out 
of 
the 
love 
and 
estimation 
of 
Trajan’s 
moral 
virtues, 
to 
have 
made 
unto 
God 
passionate 
and 
fervent 
prayers 
for 
the 
delivery 
of 
his 
soul 
out 
of 
hell, 
and 
to 
have 
obtained 
it, 
with 
a 
caveat 
that 
he 
should 
make 
no 
more 
such 
petitions. 
In 
this 
prince’s 
time 
also 
the 
persecutions 
against 
the 
Christians 
received 
intermission 
upon 
the 
certificate 
of 
Plinius 
Secundus, 
a 
man 
of 
excellent 
learning 
and 
by 
Trajan 
advanced. 
(6) 
Adrian, 
his 
successor, 
was 
the 
most 
curious 
man 
that 
lived, 
and 
the 
most 
universal 
inquirer: 
insomuch 
as 
it 
was 
noted 
for 
an 
error 
in 
his 
mind 
that 
he 
desired 
to 
comprehend 
all 
things, 
and 
not 
to 
reserve 
himself 
for 
the 
worthiest 
things, 
falling 
into 
the 
like 
humour 
that 
was 
long 
before 
noted 
in 
Philip 
of 
Macedon, 
who, 
when 
he 
would 
needs 
overrule 
and 
put 
down 
an 
excellent 
musician 
in 
an 
argument 
touching 
music, 
was 
well 
answered 
by 
him 
again 
—“God 
forbid, 
sir,” 
saith 
he, 
“that 
your 
fortune 
should 
be 
so 
bad 

as 
to 
know 
these 
things 
better 
than 
I.” 
It 
pleased 
God 
likewise 
to 
use 
the 
curiosity 
of 
this 
emperor 
as 
an 
inducement 
to 
the 
peace 
of 
His 
Church 
in 
those 
days; 
for 
having 
Christ 
in 
veneration, 
not 
as 
a 
God 
or 
Saviour, 
but 
as 
a 
wonder 
or 
novelty, 
and 
having 
his 
picture 
in 
his 
gallery 
matched 
with 
Apollonius 
(with 
whom 
in 
his 
vain 
imagination 
he 
thought 
its 
had 
some 
conformity), 
yet 
it 
served 
the 
turn 
to 
allay 
the 
bitter 
hatred 
of 
those 
times 
against 
the 
Christian 
name, 
so 
as 
the 
Church 
had 
peace 
during 
his 
time. 
And 
for 
his 
government 
civil, 
although 
he 
did 
not 
attain 
to 
that 
of 
Trajan’s 
in 
glory 
of 
arms 
or 
perfection 
of 
justice, 
yet 
in 
deserving 
of 
the 
weal 
of 
the 
subject 
he 
did 
exceed 
him. 
For 
Trajan 
erected 
many 
famous 
monuments 
and 
buildings, 
insomuch 
as 
Constantine 
the 
Great 
in 
emulation 
was 
wont 
to 
call 
him 
Parietaria, 
“wall-flower,” 
because 
his 
name 
was 
upon 
so 
many 
walls; 
but 
his 
buildings 
and 
works 
were 
more 
of 
glory 
and 
triumph 
than 
use 
and 
necessity. 
But 
Adrian 
spent 
his 
whole 
reign, 
which 
was 
peaceable, 
in 
a 
perambulation 
or 
survey 
of 
the 
Roman 
Empire, 
giving 
order 
and 
making 
assignation 
where 
he 
went 
for 
re-edifying 
of 
cities, 
towns, 
and 
forts 
decayed, 
and 
for 
cutting 
of 
rivers 
and 
streams, 
and 
for 
making 
bridges 
and 
passages, 
and 
for 
policing 
of 
cities 
and 
commonalties 
with 
new 
ordinances 
and 
constitutions, 
and 
granting 
new 
franchises 
and 
incorporations; 
so 
that 
his 
whole 
time 
was 
a 
very 
restoration 
of 
all 
the 
lapses 
and 
decays 
of 
former 
times. 


(7) 
Antoninus 
Pius, 
who 
succeeded 
him, 
was 
a 
prince 
excellently 
learned, 
and 
had 
the 
patient 
and 
subtle 
wit 
of 
a 
schoolman, 
insomuch 
as 
in 
common 
speech 
(which 
leaves 
no 
virtue 
untaxed) 
he 
was 
called 
Cymini 
Sector, 
a 
carver 
or 
a 
divider 
of 
cummin 
seed, 
which 
is 
one 
of 
the 
least 
seeds. 
Such 
a 
patience 
he 
had 
and 
settled 
spirit 
to 
enter 
into 
the 
least 
and 
most 
exact 
differences 
of 
causes, 
a 
fruit 
no 
doubt 
of 
the 
exceeding 
tranquillity 
and 
serenity 
of 
his 
mind, 
which 
being 
no 
ways 
charged 
or 
encumbered, 
either 
with 
fears, 
remorses, 
or 
scruples, 
but 
having 
been 
noted 
for 
a 
man 
of 
the 
purest 
goodness, 
without 
all 
fiction 
or 
affectation, 
that 
hath 
reigned 
or 
lived, 
made 
his 
mind 
continually 
present 
and 
entire. 
He 
likewise 
approached 
a 
degree 
nearer 
unto 
Christianity, 
and 
became, 
as 
Agrippa 
said 
unto 
St. 
Paul, 
“half 
a 
Christian,” 
holding 
their 
religion 
and 
law 
in 
good 
opinion, 
and 
not 
only 
ceasing 
persecution, 
but 
giving 
way 
to 
the 
advancement 
of 
Christians. 
(5) 
There 
succeeded 
him 
the 
first 
Divi 
fratres, 
the 
two 
adoptive 
brethren 
— 
Lucius 
Commodus 
Verus, 
son 
to 
AElius 
Verus, 
who 
delighted 
much 
in 
the 
softer 
kind 
of 
learning, 
and 
was 
wont 
to 
call 
the 
poet 
Martial 
his 

Virgil; 
and 
Marcus 
Aurelius 
Antoninus: 
whereof 
the 
latter, 
who 
obscured 
his 
colleague 
and 
survived 
him 
long, 
was 
named 
the 
“Philosopher,” 
who, 
as 
he 
excelled 
all 
the 
rest 
in 
learning, 
so 
he 
excelled 
them 
likewise 
in 
perfection 
of 
all 
royal 
virtues; 
insomuch 
as 
Julianus 
the 
emperor, 
in 
his 
book 
entitled 
Caersares, 
being 
as 
a 
pasquil 
or 
satire 
to 
deride 
all 
his 
predecessors, 
feigned 
that 
they 
were 
all 
invited 
to 
a 
banquet 
of 
the 
gods, 
and 
Silenus 
the 
jester 
sat 
at 
the 
nether 
end 
of 
the 
table 
and 
bestowed 
a 
scoff 
on 
everyone 
as 
they 
came 
in; 
but 
when 
Marcus 
Philosophus 
came 
in, 
Silenus 
was 
gravelled 
and 
out 
of 
countenance, 
not 
knowing 
where 
to 
carp 
at 
him, 
save 
at 
the 
last 
he 
gave 
a 
glance 
at 
his 
patience 
towards 
his 
wife. 
And 
the 
virtue 
of 
this 
prince, 
continued 
with 
that 
of 
his 
predecessor, 
made 
the 
name 
of 
Antoninus 
so 
sacred 
in 
the 
world, 
that 
though 
it 
were 
extremely 
dishonoured 
in 
Commodus, 
Caracalla, 
and 
Heliogabalus, 
who 
all 
bare 
the 
name, 
yet, 
when 
Alexander 
Severus 
refused 
the 
name 
because 
he 
was 
a 
stranger 
to 
the 
family, 
the 
Senate 
with 
one 
acclamation 
said, 
Quomodo 
Augustus, 
sic 
et 
Antoninus. 
In 
such 
renown 
and 
veneration 
was 
the 
name 
of 
these 
two 
princes 
in 
those 
days, 
that 
they 
would 
have 
had 
it 
as 
a 
perpetual 
addition 
in 
all 
the 
emperors’ 
style. 
In 
this 
emperor’s 
time 
also 
the 
Church 
for 
the 
most 
part 
was 
in 
peace; 
so 
as 
in 
this 
sequence 
of 
six 
princes 
we 
do 
see 
the 
blessed 
effects 
of 
learning 
in 
sovereignty, 
painted 
forth 
in 
the 
greatest 
table 
of 
the 
world. 


(9) 
But 
for 
a 
tablet 
or 
picture 
of 
smaller 
volume 
(not 
presuming 
to 
speak 
of 
your 
Majesty 
that 
liveth), 
in 
my 
judgment 
the 
most 
excellent 
is 
that 
of 
Queen 
Elizabeth, 
your 
immediate 
predecessor 
in 
this 
part 
of 
Britain; 
a 
prince 
that, 
if 
Plutarch 
were 
now 
alive 
to 
write 
lives 
by 
parallels, 
would 
trouble 
him, 
I 
think, 
to 
find 
for 
her 
a 
parallel 
amongst 
women. 
This 
lady 
was 
endued 
with 
learning 
in 
her 
sex 
singular, 
and 
rare 
even 
amongst 
masculine 
princes 
— 
whether 
we 
speak 
of 
learning, 
of 
language, 
or 
of 
science, 
modern 
or 
ancient, 
divinity 
or 
humanity 
— 
and 
unto 
the 
very 
last 
year 
of 
her 
life 
she 
accustomed 
to 
appoint 
set 
hours 
for 
reading, 
scarcely 
any 
young 
student 
in 
a 
university 
more 
daily 
or 
more 
duly. 
As 
for 
her 
government, 
I 
assure 
myself 
(I 
shall 
not 
exceed 
if 
I 
do 
affirm) 
that 
this 
part 
of 
the 
island 
never 
had 
forty-five 
years 
of 
better 
tines, 
and 
yet 
not 
through 
the 
calmness 
of 
the 
season, 
but 
through 
the 
wisdom 
of 
her 
regiment. 
For 
if 
there 
be 
considered, 
of 
the 
one 
side, 
the 
truth 
of 
religion 
established, 
the 
constant 
peace 
and 
security, 
the 
good 
administration 
of 
justice, 
the 
temperate 
use 
of 
the 
prerogative, 
not 
slackened, 
nor 
much 
strained; 
the 
flourishing 
state 
of 
learning, 
sortable 
to 
so 
excellent 
a 
patroness; 
the 
convenient 
estate 
of 
wealth 
and 
means, 
both 
of 

crown 
and 
subject; 
the 
habit 
of 
obedience, 
and 
the 
moderation 
of 
discontents; 
and 
there 
be 
considered, 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
the 
differences 
of 
religion, 
the 
troubles 
of 
neighbour 
countries, 
the 
ambition 
of 
Spain, 
and 
opposition 
of 
Rome, 
and 
then 
that 
she 
was 
solitary 
and 
of 
herself; 
these 
things, 
I 
say, 
considered, 
as 
I 
could 
not 
have 
chosen 
an 
instance 
so 
recent 
and 
so 
proper, 
so 
I 
suppose 
I 
could 
not 
have 
chosen 
one 
more 
remarkable 
or 
eminent 
to 
the 
purpose 
now 
in 
hand, 
which 
is 
concerning 
the 
conjunction 
of 
learning 
in 
the 
prince 
with 
felicity 
in 
the 
people. 


(10) 
Neither 
hath 
learning 
an 
influence 
and 
operation 
only 
upon 
civil 
merit 
and 
moral 
virtue, 
and 
the 
arts 
or 
temperature 
of 
peace 
and 
peaceable 
government; 
but 
likewise 
it 
hath 
no 
less 
power 
and 
efficacy 
in 
enablement 
towards 
martial 
and 
military 
virtue 
and 
prowess, 
as 
may 
be 
notably 
represented 
in 
the 
examples 
of 
Alexander 
the 
Great 
and 
Caesar 
the 
Dictator 
(mentioned 
before, 
but 
now 
in 
fit 
place 
to 
be 
resumed), 
of 
whose 
virtues 
and 
acts 
in 
war 
there 
needs 
no 
note 
or 
recital, 
having 
been 
the 
wonders 
of 
time 
in 
that 
kind; 
but 
of 
their 
affections 
towards 
learning 
and 
perfections 
in 
learning 
it 
is 
pertinent 
to 
say 
somewhat. 
(11) 
Alexander 
was 
bred 
and 
taught 
under 
Aristotle, 
the 
great 
philosopher, 
who 
dedicated 
divers 
of 
his 
books 
of 
philosophy 
unto 
him; 
he 
was 
attended 
with 
Callisthenes 
and 
divers 
other 
learned 
persons, 
that 
followed 
him 
in 
camp, 
throughout 
his 
journeys 
and 
conquests. 
What 
price 
and 
estimation 
he 
had 
learning 
in 
doth 
notably 
appear 
in 
these 
three 
particulars: 
first, 
in 
the 
envy 
he 
used 
to 
express 
that 
he 
bare 
towards 
Achilles, 
in 
this, 
that 
he 
had 
so 
good 
a 
trumpet 
of 
his 
praises 
as 
Homer’s 
verses; 
secondly, 
in 
the 
judgment 
or 
solution 
he 
gave 
touching 
that 
precious 
cabinet 
of 
Darius, 
which 
was 
found 
among 
his 
jewels 
(whereof 
question 
was 
made 
what 
thing 
was 
worthy 
to 
be 
put 
into 
it, 
and 
he 
gave 
his 
opinion 
for 
Homer’s 
works); 
thirdly, 
in 
his 
letter 
to 
Aristotle, 
after 
he 
had 
set 
forth 
his 
books 
of 
nature, 
wherein 
he 
expostulateth 
with 
him 
for 
publishing 
the 
secrets 
or 
mysteries 
of 
philosophy; 
and 
gave 
him 
to 
understand 
that 
himself 
esteemed 
it 
more 
to 
excel 
other 
men 
in 
learning 
and 
knowledge 
than 
in 
power 
and 
empire. 
And 
what 
use 
he 
had 
of 
learning 
doth 
appear, 
or 
rather 
shine, 
in 
all 
his 
speeches 
and 
answers, 
being 
full 
of 
science 
and 
use 
of 
science, 
and 
that 
in 
all 
variety. 
(12) 
And 
herein 
again 
it 
may 
seem 
a 
thing 
scholastical, 
and 
somewhat 
idle 
to 
recite 
things 
that 
every 
man 
knoweth; 
but 
yet, 
since 
the 

argument 
I 
handle 
leadeth 
me 
thereunto, 
I 
am 
glad 
that 
men 
shall 
perceive 
I 
am 
as 
willing 
to 
flatter 
(if 
they 
will 
so 
call 
it) 
an 
Alexander, 
or 
a 
Caesar, 
or 
an 
Antoninus, 
that 
are 
dead 
many 
hundred 
years 
since, 
as 
any 
that 
now 
liveth; 
for 
it 
is 
the 
displaying 
of 
the 
glory 
of 
learning 
in 
sovereignty 
that 
I 
propound 
to 
myself, 
and 
not 
a 
humour 
of 
declaiming 
in 
any 
man’s 
praises. 
Observe, 
then, 
the 
speech 
he 
used 
of 
Diogenes, 
and 
see 
if 
it 
tend 
not 
to 
the 
true 
state 
of 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
questions 
of 
moral 
philosophy: 
whether 
the 
enjoying 
of 
outward 
things, 
or 
the 
contemning 
of 
them, 
be 
the 
greatest 
happiness; 
for 
when 
he 
saw 
Diogenes 
so 
perfectly 
contented 
with 
so 
little, 
he 
said 
to 
those 
that 
mocked 
at 
his 
condition, 
“were 
I 
not 
Alexander, 
I 
would 
wish 
to 
be 
Diogenes.” 
But 
Seneca 
inverteth 
it, 
and 
saith, 
“Plus 
erat, 
quod 
hic 
nollet 
accipere, 
quam 
quod 
ille 
posset 
dare.” 
There 
were 
more 
things 
which 
Diogenes 
would 
have 
refused 
than 
those 
were 
which 
Alexander 
could 
have 
given 
or 
enjoyed. 


(13) 
Observe, 
again, 
that 
speech 
which 
was 
usual 
with 
him,—“That 
he 
felt 
his 
mortality 
chiefly 
in 
two 
things, 
sleep 
and 
lust;” 
and 
see 
if 
it 
were 
not 
a 
speech 
extracted 
out 
of 
the 
depth 
of 
natural 
philosophy, 
and 
liker 
to 
have 
come 
out 
of 
the 
mouth 
of 
Aristotle 
or 
Democritus 
than 
from 
Alexander. 
(14) 
See, 
again, 
that 
speech 
of 
humanity 
and 
poesy, 
when, 
upon 
the 
bleeding 
of 
his 
wounds, 
he 
called 
unto 
him 
one 
of 
his 
flatterers, 
that 
was 
wont 
to 
ascribe 
to 
him 
divine 
honour, 
and 
said, 
“Look, 
this 
is 
very 
blood; 
this 
is 
not 
such 
a 
liquor 
as 
Homer 
speaketh 
of, 
which 
ran 
from 
Venus’ 
hand 
when 
it 
was 
pierced 
by 
Diomedes.” 
(15) 
See 
likewise 
his 
readiness 
in 
reprehension 
of 
logic 
in 
the 
speech 
he 
used 
to 
Cassander, 
upon 
a 
complaint 
that 
was 
made 
against 
his 
father 
Antipater; 
for 
when 
Alexander 
happened 
to 
say, 
“Do 
you 
think 
these 
men 
would 
have 
come 
from 
so 
far 
to 
complain 
except 
they 
had 
just 
cause 
of 
grief?” 
and 
Cassander 
answered, 
“Yea, 
that 
was 
the 
matter, 
because 
they 
thought 
they 
should 
not 
be 
disproved;” 
said 
Alexander, 
laughing, 
“See 
the 
subtleties 
of 
Aristotle, 
to 
take 
a 
matter 
both 
ways, 
pro 
et 
contra, 
&c.” 
(16) 
But 
note, 
again, 
how 
well 
he 
could 
use 
the 
same 
art 
which 
he 
reprehended 
to 
serve 
his 
own 
humour: 
when 
bearing 
a 
secret 
grudge 
to 
Callisthenes, 
because 
he 
was 
against 
the 
new 
ceremony 
of 
his 
adoration, 
feasting 
one 
night 
where 
the 
same 
Callisthenes 
was 
at 
the 
table, 
it 
was 
moved 
by 
some 
after 
supper, 
for 
entertainment 
sake, 
that 
Callisthenes, 
who 
was 
an 

eloquent 
man, 
might 
speak 
of 
some 
theme 
or 
purpose 
at 
his 
own 
choice; 
which 
Callisthenes 
did, 
choosing 
the 
praise 
of 
the 
Macedonian 
nation 
for 
his 
discourse, 
and 
performing 
the 
same 
with 
so 
good 
manner 
as 
the 
hearers 
were 
much 
ravished; 
whereupon 
Alexander, 
nothing 
pleased, 
said, 
“It 
was 
easy 
to 
be 
eloquent 
upon 
so 
good 
a 
subject; 
but,” 
saith 
he, 
“turn 
your 
style, 
and 
let 
us 
hear 
what 
you 
can 
say 
against 
us;” 
which 
Callisthenes 
presently 
undertook, 
and 
did 
with 
that 
sting 
and 
life 
that 
Alexander 
interrupted 
him, 
and 
said, 
“The 
goodness 
of 
the 
cause 
made 
him 
eloquent 
before, 
and 
despite 
made 
him 
eloquent 
then 
again.” 


(17) 
Consider 
further, 
for 
tropes 
of 
rhetoric, 
that 
excellent 
use 
of 
a 
metaphor 
or 
translation, 
wherewith 
he 
taxeth 
Antipater, 
who 
was 
an 
imperious 
and 
tyrannous 
governor; 
for 
when 
one 
of 
Antipater’s 
friends 
commended 
him 
to 
Alexander 
for 
his 
moderation, 
that 
he 
did 
not 
degenerate 
as 
his 
other 
lieutenants 
did 
into 
the 
Persian 
pride, 
in 
uses 
of 
purple, 
but 
kept 
the 
ancient 
habit 
of 
Macedon, 
of 
black. 
“True,” 
saith 
Alexander; 
“but 
Antipater 
is 
all 
purple 
within.” 
Or 
that 
other, 
when 
Parmenio 
came 
to 
him 
in 
the 
plain 
of 
Arbela 
and 
showed 
him 
the 
innumerable 
multitude 
of 
his 
enemies, 
specially 
as 
they 
appeared 
by 
the 
infinite 
number 
of 
lights 
as 
it 
had 
been 
a 
new 
firmament 
of 
stars, 
and 
thereupon 
advised 
him 
to 
assail 
them 
by 
night; 
whereupon 
he 
answered, 
“That 
he 
would 
not 
steal 
the 
victory.” 
(18) 
For 
matter 
of 
policy, 
weigh 
that 
significant 
distinction, 
so 
much 
in 
all 
ages 
embraced, 
that 
he 
made 
between 
his 
two 
friends 
Hephaestion 
and 
Craterus, 
when 
he 
said, 
“That 
the 
one 
loved 
Alexander, 
and 
the 
other 
loved 
the 
king:” 
describing 
the 
principal 
difference 
of 
princes’ 
best 
servants, 
that 
some 
in 
affection 
love 
their 
person, 
and 
other 
in 
duty 
love 
their 
crown. 
(19) 
Weigh 
also 
that 
excellent 
taxation 
of 
an 
error, 
ordinary 
with 
counsellors 
of 
princes, 
that 
they 
counsel 
their 
masters 
according 
to 
the 
model 
of 
their 
own 
mind 
and 
fortune, 
and 
not 
of 
their 
masters. 
When 
upon 
Darius’ 
great 
offers 
Parmenio 
had 
said, 
“Surely 
I 
would 
accept 
these 
offers 
were 
I 
as 
Alexander;” 
saith 
Alexander, 
“So 
would 
I 
were 
I 
as 
Parmenio.” 
(20) 
Lastly, 
weigh 
that 
quick 
and 
acute 
reply 
which 
he 
made 
when 
he 
gave 
so 
large 
gifts 
to 
his 
friends 
and 
servants, 
and 
was 
asked 
what 
he 
did 
reserve 
for 
himself, 
and 
he 
answered, 
“Hope.” 
Weigh, 
I 
say, 
whether 
he 
had 
not 
cast 
up 
his 
account 
aright, 
because 
hope 
must 
be 
the 
portion 
of 
all 
that 
resolve 
upon 
great 
enterprises; 
for 
this 
was 
Caesar’s 
portion 
when 
he 
went 

first 
into 
Gaul, 
his 
estate 
being 
then 
utterly 
overthrown 
with 
largesses. 
And 
this 
was 
likewise 
the 
portion 
of 
that 
noble 
prince, 
howsoever 
transported 
with 
ambition, 
Henry 
Duke 
of 
Guise, 
of 
whom 
it 
was 
usually 
said 
that 
he 
was 
the 
greatest 
usurer 
in 
France, 
because 
he 
had 
turned 
all 
his 
estate 
into 
obligations. 


(21) 
To 
conclude, 
therefore, 
as 
certain 
critics 
are 
used 
to 
say 
hyperbolically, 
“That 
if 
all 
sciences 
were 
lost 
they 
might 
be 
found 
in 
Virgil,” 
so 
certainly 
this 
may 
be 
said 
truly, 
there 
are 
the 
prints 
and 
footsteps 
of 
learning 
in 
those 
few 
speeches 
which 
are 
reported 
of 
this 
prince, 
the 
admiration 
of 
whom, 
when 
I 
consider 
him 
not 
as 
Alexander 
the 
Great, 
but 
as 
Aristotle’s 
scholar, 
hath 
carried 
me 
too 
far. 
(22) 
As 
for 
Julius 
Caesar, 
the 
excellency 
of 
his 
learning 
needeth 
not 
to 
be 
argued 
from 
his 
education, 
or 
his 
company, 
or 
his 
speeches; 
but 
in 
a 
further 
degree 
doth 
declare 
itself 
in 
his 
writings 
and 
works: 
whereof 
some 
are 
extant 
and 
permanent, 
and 
some 
unfortunately 
perished. 
For 
first, 
we 
see 
there 
is 
left 
unto 
us 
that 
excellent 
history 
of 
his 
own 
wars, 
which 
he 
entitled 
only 
a 
Commentary, 
wherein 
all 
succeeding 
times 
have 
admired 
the 
solid 
weight 
of 
matter, 
and 
the 
real 
passages 
and 
lively 
images 
of 
actions 
and 
persons, 
expressed 
in 
the 
greatest 
propriety 
of 
words 
and 
perspicuity 
of 
narration 
that 
ever 
was; 
which 
that 
it 
was 
not 
the 
effect 
of 
a 
natural 
gift, 
but 
of 
learning 
and 
precept, 
is 
well 
witnessed 
by 
that 
work 
of 
his 
entitled 
De 
Analogia, 
being 
a 
grammatical 
philosophy, 
wherein 
he 
did 
labour 
to 
make 
this 
same 
Vox 
ad 
placitum 
to 
become 
Vox 
ad 
licitum, 
and 
to 
reduce 
custom 
of 
speech 
to 
congruity 
of 
speech; 
and 
took 
as 
it 
were 
the 
pictures 
of 
words 
from 
the 
life 
of 
reason. 
(23) 
So 
we 
receive 
from 
him, 
as 
a 
monument 
both 
of 
his 
power 
and 
learning, 
the 
then 
reformed 
computation 
of 
the 
year; 
well 
expressing 
that 
he 
took 
it 
to 
be 
as 
great 
a 
glory 
to 
himself 
to 
observe 
and 
know 
the 
law 
of 
the 
heavens, 
as 
to 
give 
law 
to 
men 
upon 
the 
earth. 
(24) 
So 
likewise 
in 
that 
book 
of 
his, 
Anti-Cato, 
it 
may 
easily 
appear 
that 
he 
did 
aspire 
as 
well 
to 
victory 
of 
wit 
as 
victory 
of 
war: 
undertaking 
therein 
a 
conflict 
against 
the 
greatest 
champion 
with 
the 
pen 
that 
then 
lived, 
Cicero 
the 
orator. 
(25) 
So, 
again, 
in 
his 
book 
of 
Apophthegms, 
which 
he 
collected, 
we 
see 
that 
he 
esteemed 
it 
more 
honour 
to 
make 
himself 
but 
a 
pair 
of 
tables, 
to 
take 
the 
wise 
and 
pithy 
words 
of 
others, 
than 
to 
have 
every 
word 
of 
his 
own 

to 
be 
made 
an 
apophthegm 
or 
an 
oracle, 
as 
vain 
princes, 
by 
custom 
of 
flattery, 
pretend 
to 
do. 
And 
yet 
if 
I 
should 
enumerate 
divers 
of 
his 
speeches, 
as 
I 
did 
those 
of 
Alexander, 
they 
are 
truly 
such 
as 
Solomon 
noteth, 
when 
he 
saith, 
Verba 
sapientum 
tanquam 
aculei, 
et 
tanquam 
clavi 
in 
altum 
defixi: 
whereof 
I 
will 
only 
recite 
three, 
not 
so 
delectable 
for 
elegancy, 
but 
admirable 
for 
vigour 
and 
efficacy. 


(26) 
As 
first, 
it 
is 
reason 
he 
be 
thought 
a 
master 
of 
words, 
that 
could 
with 
one 
word 
appease 
a 
mutiny 
in 
his 
army, 
which 
was 
thus: 
The 
Romans, 
when 
their 
generals 
did 
speak 
to 
their 
army, 
did 
use 
the 
word 
Milites, 
but 
when 
the 
magistrates 
spake 
to 
the 
people 
they 
did 
use 
the 
word 
Quirites. 
The 
soldiers 
were 
in 
tumult, 
and 
seditiously 
prayed 
to 
be 
cashiered; 
not 
that 
they 
so 
meant, 
but 
by 
expostulation 
thereof 
to 
draw 
Caesar 
to 
other 
conditions; 
wherein 
he 
being 
resolute 
not 
to 
give 
way, 
after 
some 
silence, 
he 
began 
his 
speech, 
Ego 
Quirites, 
which 
did 
admit 
them 
already 
cashiered 
— 
wherewith 
they 
were 
so 
surprised, 
crossed, 
and 
confused, 
as 
they 
would 
not 
suffer 
him 
to 
go 
on 
in 
his 
speech, 
but 
relinquished 
their 
demands, 
and 
made 
it 
their 
suit 
to 
be 
again 
called 
by 
the 
name 
of 
Milites. 
(27) 
The 
second 
speech 
was 
thus: 
Caesar 
did 
extremely 
affect 
the 
name 
of 
king; 
and 
some 
were 
set 
on 
as 
he 
passed 
by 
in 
popular 
acclamation 
to 
salute 
him 
king. 
Whereupon, 
finding 
the 
cry 
weak 
and 
poor, 
he 
put 
it 
off 
thus, 
in 
a 
kind 
of 
jest, 
as 
if 
they 
had 
mistaken 
his 
surname: 
Non 
Rex 
sum, 
sed 
Caesar; 
a 
speech 
that, 
if 
it 
be 
searched, 
the 
life 
and 
fulness 
of 
it 
can 
scarce 
be 
expressed. 
For, 
first, 
it 
was 
a 
refusal 
of 
the 
name, 
but 
yet 
not 
serious; 
again, 
it 
did 
signify 
an 
infinite 
confidence 
and 
magnanimity, 
as 
if 
he 
presumed 
Caesar 
was 
the 
greater 
title, 
as 
by 
his 
worthiness 
it 
is 
come 
to 
pass 
till 
this 
day. 
But 
chiefly 
it 
was 
a 
speech 
of 
great 
allurement 
toward 
his 
own 
purpose, 
as 
if 
the 
state 
did 
strive 
with 
him 
but 
for 
a 
name, 
whereof 
mean 
families 
were 
vested; 
for 
Rex 
was 
a 
surname 
with 
the 
Romans, 
as 
well 
as 
King 
is 
with 
us. 
(28) 
The 
last 
speech 
which 
I 
will 
mention 
was 
used 
to 
Metellus, 
when 
Caesar, 
after 
war 
declared, 
did 
possess 
himself 
of 
this 
city 
of 
Rome; 
at 
which 
time, 
entering 
into 
the 
inner 
treasury 
to 
take 
the 
money 
there 
accumulate, 
Metellus, 
being 
tribune, 
forbade 
him. 
Whereto 
Caesar 
said, 
“That 
if 
he 
did 
not 
desist, 
he 
would 
lay 
him 
dead 
in 
the 
place.” 
And 
presently 
taking 
himself 
up, 
he 
added, 
“Young 
man, 
it 
is 
harder 
for 
me 
to 
speak 
it 
than 
to 
do 
it 
— 
Adolescens, 
durius 
est 
mihi 
hoc 
dicere 
quam 
facere.” 
A 
speech 
compounded 
of 
the 
greatest 
terror 
and 
greatest 
clemency 
that 
could 
proceed 

out 
of 
the 
mouth 
of 
man. 


(29) 
But 
to 
return 
and 
conclude 
with 
him, 
it 
is 
evident 
himself 
knew 
well 
his 
own 
perfection 
in 
learning, 
and 
took 
it 
upon 
him, 
as 
appeared 
when 
upon 
occasion 
that 
some 
spake 
what 
a 
strange 
resolution 
it 
was 
in 
Lucius 
Sylla 
to 
resign 
his 
dictators, 
he, 
scoffing 
at 
him 
to 
his 
own 
advantage, 
answered, 
“That 
Sylla 
could 
not 
skill 
of 
letters, 
and 
therefore 
knew 
not 
how 
to 
dictate.” 
(30) 
And 
here 
it 
were 
fit 
to 
leave 
this 
point, 
touching 
the 
concurrence 
of 
military 
virtue 
and 
learning 
(for 
what 
example 
should 
come 
with 
any 
grace 
after 
those 
two 
of 
Alexander 
and 
Caesar?), 
were 
it 
not 
in 
regard 
of 
the 
rareness 
of 
circumstance, 
that 
I 
find 
in 
one 
other 
particular, 
as 
that 
which 
did 
so 
suddenly 
pass 
from 
extreme 
scorn 
to 
extreme 
wonder: 
and 
it 
is 
of 
Xenophon 
the 
philosopher, 
who 
went 
from 
Socrates’ 
school 
into 
Asia 
in 
the 
expedition 
of 
Cyrus 
the 
younger 
against 
King 
Artaxerxes. 
This 
Xenophon 
at 
that 
time 
was 
very 
young, 
and 
never 
had 
seen 
the 
wars 
before, 
neither 
had 
any 
command 
in 
the 
army, 
but 
only 
followed 
the 
war 
as 
a 
voluntary, 
for 
the 
love 
and 
conversation 
of 
Proxenus, 
his 
friend. 
He 
was 
present 
when 
Falinus 
came 
in 
message 
from 
the 
great 
king 
to 
the 
Grecians, 
after 
that 
Cyrus 
was 
slain 
in 
the 
field, 
and 
they, 
a 
handful 
of 
men, 
left 
to 
themselves 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
king’s 
territories, 
cut 
off 
from 
their 
country 
by 
many 
navigable 
rivers 
and 
many 
hundred 
miles. 
The 
message 
imported 
that 
they 
should 
deliver 
up 
their 
arms 
and 
submit 
themselves 
to 
the 
king’s 
mercy. 
To 
which 
message, 
before 
answer 
was 
made, 
divers 
of 
the 
army 
conferred 
familiarly 
with 
Falinus; 
and 
amongst 
the 
rest 
Xenophon 
happened 
to 
say, 
“Why, 
Falinus, 
we 
have 
now 
but 
these 
two 
things 
left, 
our 
arms 
and 
our 
virtue; 
and 
if 
we 
yield 
up 
our 
arms, 
how 
shall 
we 
make 
use 
of 
our 
virtue?” 
Whereto 
Falinus, 
smiling 
on 
him, 
said, 
“If 
I 
be 
not 
deceived, 
young 
gentleman, 
you 
are 
an 
Athenian, 
and 
I 
believe 
you 
study 
philosophy, 
and 
it 
is 
pretty 
that 
you 
say; 
but 
you 
are 
much 
abused 
if 
you 
think 
your 
virtue 
can 
withstand 
the 
king’s 
power.” 
Here 
was 
the 
scorn; 
the 
wonder 
followed: 
which 
was 
that 
this 
young 
scholar 
or 
philosopher, 
after 
all 
the 
captains 
were 
murdered 
in 
parley 
by 
treason, 
conducted 
those 
ten 
thousand 
foot, 
through 
the 
heart 
of 
all 
the 
king’s 
high 
countries, 
from 
Babylon 
to 
Graecia 
in 
safety, 
in 
despite 
of 
all 
the 
king’s 
forces, 
to 
the 
astonishment 
of 
the 
world, 
and 
the 
encouragement 
of 
the 
Grecians 
in 
times 
succeeding 
to 
make 
invasion 
upon 
the 
kings 
of 
Persia, 
as 
was 
after 
purposed 
by 
Jason 
the 
Thessalian, 
attempted 

by 
Agesilaus 
the 
Spartan, 
and 
achieved 
by 
Alexander 
the 
Macedonian, 
all 
upon 
the 
ground 
of 
the 
act 
of 
that 
young 
scholar. 



VIII 


(1) 
To 
proceed 
now 
from 
imperial 
and 
military 
virtue 
to 
moral 
and 
private 
virtue; 
first, 
it 
is 
an 
assured 
truth, 
which 
is 
contained 
in 
the 
verses:— 
“Scilicet 
ingenuas 
didicisse 
fideliter 
artes 
Emollit 
mores 
nec 
sinit 
esse 
feros.” 


It 
taketh 
away 
the 
wildness 
and 
barbarism 
and 
fierceness 
of 
men’s 
minds; 
but 
indeed 
the 
accent 
had 
need 
be 
upon 
fideliter; 
for 
a 
little 
superficial 
learning 
doth 
rather 
work 
a 
contrary 
effect. 
It 
taketh 
away 
all 
levity, 
temerity, 
and 
insolency, 
by 
copious 
suggestion 
of 
all 
doubts 
and 
difficulties, 
and 
acquainting 
the 
mind 
to 
balance 
reasons 
on 
both 
sides, 
and 
to 
turn 
back 
the 
first 
offers 
and 
conceits 
of 
the 
mind, 
and 
to 
accept 
of 
nothing 
but 
examined 
and 
tried. 
It 
taketh 
away 
vain 
admiration 
of 
anything, 
which 
is 
the 
root 
of 
all 
weakness. 
For 
all 
things 
are 
admired, 
either 
because 
they 
are 
new, 
or 
because 
they 
are 
great. 
For 
novelty, 
no 
man 
that 
wadeth 
in 
learning 
or 
contemplation 
thoroughly 
but 
will 
find 
that 
printed 
in 
his 
heart, 
Nil 
novi 
super 
terram. 
Neither 
can 
any 
man 
marvel 
at 
the 
play 
of 
puppets, 
that 
goeth 
behind 
the 
curtain, 
and 
adviseth 
well 
of 
the 
motion. 
And 
for 
magnitude, 
as 
Alexander 
the 
Great, 
after 
that 
he 
was 
used 
to 
great 
armies, 
and 
the 
great 
conquests 
of 
the 
spacious 
provinces 
in 
Asia, 
when 
he 
received 
letters 
out 
of 
Greece, 
of 
some 
fights 
and 
services 
there, 
which 
were 
commonly 
for 
a 
passage 
or 
a 
fort, 
or 
some 
walled 
town 
at 
the 
most, 
he 
said: 
—“It 
seemed 
to 
him 
that 
he 
was 
advertised 
of 
the 
battles 
of 
the 
frogs 
and 
the 
mice, 
that 
the 
old 
tales 
went 
of.” 
So 
certainly, 
if 
a 
man 
meditate 
much 
upon 
the 
universal 
frame 
of 
nature, 
the 
earth 
with 
men 
upon 
it 
(the 
divineness 
of 
souls 
except) 
will 
not 
seem 
much 
other 
than 
an 
ant-hill, 
whereas 
some 
ants 
carry 
corn, 
and 
some 
carry 
their 
young, 
and 
some 
go 
empty, 
and 
all 
to 
and 
fro 
a 
little 
heap 
of 
dust. 
It 
taketh 
away 
or 
mitigateth 
fear 
of 
death 
or 
adverse 
fortune, 
which 
is 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
impediments 
of 
virtue 
and 
imperfections 
of 
manners. 
For 
if 
a 
man’s 
mind 
be 
deeply 
seasoned 
with 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
mortality 
and 
corruptible 
nature 
of 
things, 
he 
will 
easily 
concur 
with 
Epictetus, 
who 
went 
forth 
one 
day 
and 
saw 
a 
woman 
weeping 
for 
her 
pitcher 
of 
earth 
that 
was 
broken, 
and 
went 
forth 
the 
next 
day 
and 
saw 
a 
woman 
weeping 
for 
her 
son 



that 
was 
dead, 
and 
thereupon 
said, 
“Heri 
vidi 
fragilem 
frangi, 
hodie 
vidi 
mortalem 
mori.” 
And, 
therefore, 
Virgil 
did 
excellently 
and 
profoundly 
couple 
the 
knowledge 
of 
causes 
and 
the 
conquest 
of 
all 
fears 
together, 
as 
concomitantia. 


“Felix, 
qui 
potuit 
rerum 
cognoscere 
causas, 
Quique 
metus 
omnes, 
et 
inexorabile 
fatum 
Subjecit 
pedibus, 
strepitumque 
Acherontis 
avari.” 


(2) 
It 
were 
too 
long 
to 
go 
over 
the 
particular 
remedies 
which 
learning 
doth 
minister 
to 
all 
the 
diseases 
of 
the 
mind: 
sometimes 
purging 
the 
ill 
humours, 
sometimes 
opening 
the 
obstructions, 
sometimes 
helping 
digestion, 
sometimes 
increasing 
appetite, 
sometimes 
healing 
the 
wounds 
and 
exulcerations 
thereof, 
and 
the 
like; 
and, 
therefore, 
I 
will 
conclude 
with 
that 
which 
hath 
rationem 
totius 
— 
which 
is, 
that 
it 
disposeth 
the 
constitution 
of 
the 
mind 
not 
to 
be 
fixed 
or 
settled 
in 
the 
defects 
thereof, 
but 
still 
to 
be 
capable 
and 
susceptible 
of 
growth 
and 
reformation. 
For 
the 
unlearned 
man 
knows 
not 
what 
it 
is 
to 
descend 
into 
himself, 
or 
to 
call 
himself 
to 
account, 
nor 
the 
pleasure 
of 
that 
suavissima 
vita, 
indies 
sentire 
se 
fieri 
meliorem. 
The 
good 
parts 
he 
hath 
he 
will 
learn 
to 
show 
to 
the 
full, 
and 
use 
them 
dexterously, 
but 
not 
much 
to 
increase 
them. 
The 
faults 
he 
hath 
he 
will 
learn 
how 
to 
hide 
and 
colour 
them, 
but 
not 
much 
to 
amend 
them; 
like 
an 
ill 
mower, 
that 
mows 
on 
still, 
and 
never 
whets 
his 
scythe. 
Whereas 
with 
the 
learned 
man 
it 
fares 
otherwise, 
that 
he 
doth 
ever 
intermix 
the 
correction 
and 
amendment 
of 
his 
mind 
with 
the 
use 
and 
employment 
thereof. 
Nay, 
further, 
in 
general 
and 
in 
sum, 
certain 
it 
is 
that 
Veritas 
and 
Bonitas 
differ 
but 
as 
the 
seal 
and 
the 
print; 
for 
truth 
prints 
goodness, 
and 
they 
be 
the 
clouds 
of 
error 
which 
descend 
in 
the 
storms 
of 
passions 
and 
perturbations. 
(3) 
From 
moral 
virtue 
let 
us 
pass 
on 
to 
matter 
of 
power 
and 
commandment, 
and 
consider 
whether 
in 
right 
reason 
there 
be 
any 
comparable 
with 
that 
wherewith 
knowledge 
investeth 
and 
crowneth 
man’s 
nature. 
We 
see 
the 
dignity 
of 
the 
commandment 
is 
according 
to 
the 
dignity 
of 
the 
commanded; 
to 
have 
commandment 
over 
beasts 
as 
herdmen 
have, 
is 
a 
thing 
contemptible; 
to 
have 
commandment 
over 
children 
as 
schoolmasters 
have, 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
small 
honour; 
to 
have 
commandment 
over 
galley-slaves 
is 
a 
disparagement 
rather 
than 
an 
honour. 
Neither 
is 
the 
commandment 
of 
tyrants 
much 
better, 
over 
people 
which 
have 
put 
off 
the 
generosity 
of 
their 
minds; 
and, 
therefore, 
it 
was 
ever 
holden 
that 
honours 
in 
free 
monarchies 
and 
commonwealths 
had 
a 
sweetness 
more 
than 
in 
tyrannies, 
because 
the 

commandment 
extendeth 
more 
over 
the 
wills 
of 
men, 
and 
not 
only 
over 
their 
deeds 
and 
services. 
And 
therefore, 
when 
Virgil 
putteth 
himself 
forth 
to 
attribute 
to 
Augustus 
Caesar 
the 
best 
of 
human 
honours, 
he 
doth 
it 
in 
these 
words:— 


“Victorque 
volentes 
Per 
populos 
dat 
jura, 
viamque 
affectat 
Olympo.” 


But 
yet 
the 
commandment 
of 
knowledge 
is 
yet 
higher 
than 
the 
commandment 
over 
the 
will; 
for 
it 
is 
a 
commandment 
over 
the 
reason, 
belief, 
and 
understanding 
of 
man, 
which 
is 
the 
highest 
part 
of 
the 
mind, 
and 
giveth 
law 
to 
the 
will 
itself. 
For 
there 
is 
no 
power 
on 
earth 
which 
setteth 
up 
a 
throne 
or 
chair 
of 
estate 
in 
the 
spirits 
and 
souls 
of 
men, 
and 
in 
their 
cogitations, 
imaginations, 
opinions, 
and 
beliefs, 
but 
knowledge 
and 
learning. 
And 
therefore 
we 
see 
the 
detestable 
and 
extreme 
pleasure 
that 
arch-heretics, 
and 
false 
prophets, 
and 
impostors 
are 
transported 
with, 
when 
they 
once 
find 
in 
themselves 
that 
they 
have 
a 
superiority 
in 
the 
faith 
and 
conscience 
of 
men; 
so 
great 
as 
if 
they 
have 
once 
tasted 
of 
it, 
it 
is 
seldom 
seen 
that 
any 
torture 
or 
persecution 
can 
make 
them 
relinquish 
or 
abandon 
it. 
But 
as 
this 
is 
that 
which 
the 
author 
of 
the 
Revelation 
calleth 
the 
depth 
or 
profoundness 
of 
Satan, 
so 
by 
argument 
of 
contraries, 
the 
just 
and 
lawful 
sovereignty 
over 
men’s 
understanding, 
by 
force 
of 
truth 
rightly 
interpreted, 
is 
that 
which 
approacheth 
nearest 
to 
the 
similitude 
of 
the 
divine 
rule. 


(4) 
As 
for 
fortune 
and 
advancement, 
the 
beneficence 
of 
learning 
is 
not 
so 
confined 
to 
give 
fortune 
only 
to 
states 
and 
commonwealths, 
as 
it 
doth 
not 
likewise 
give 
fortune 
to 
particular 
persons. 
For 
it 
was 
well 
noted 
long 
ago, 
that 
Homer 
hath 
given 
more 
men 
their 
livings, 
than 
either 
Sylla, 
or 
Caesar, 
or 
Augustus 
ever 
did, 
notwithstanding 
their 
great 
largesses 
and 
donatives, 
and 
distributions 
of 
lands 
to 
so 
many 
legions. 
And 
no 
doubt 
it 
is 
hard 
to 
say 
whether 
arms 
or 
learning 
have 
advanced 
greater 
numbers. 
And 
in 
case 
of 
sovereignty 
we 
see, 
that 
if 
arms 
or 
descent 
have 
carried 
away 
the 
kingdom, 
yet 
learning 
hath 
carried 
the 
priesthood, 
which 
ever 
hath 
been 
in 
some 
competition 
with 
empire. 
(5) 
Again, 
for 
the 
pleasure 
and 
delight 
of 
knowledge 
and 
learning, 
it 
far 
surpasseth 
all 
other 
in 
nature. 
For, 
shall 
the 
pleasures 
of 
the 
affections 
so 
exceed 
the 
pleasure 
of 
the 
sense, 
as 
much 
as 
the 
obtaining 
of 
desire 
or 
victory 
exceedeth 
a 
song 
or 
a 
dinner? 
and 
must 
not 
of 
consequence 
the 
pleasures 
of 

the 
intellect 
or 
understanding 
exceed 
the 
pleasures 
of 
the 
affections? 
We 
see 
in 
all 
other 
pleasures 
there 
is 
satiety, 
and 
after 
they 
be 
used, 
their 
verdure 
departeth, 
which 
showeth 
well 
they 
be 
but 
deceits 
of 
pleasure, 
and 
not 
pleasures; 
and 
that 
it 
was 
the 
novelty 
which 
pleased, 
and 
not 
the 
quality. 
And, 
therefore, 
we 
see 
that 
voluptuous 
men 
turn 
friars, 
and 
ambitions 
princes 
turn 
melancholy. 
But 
of 
knowledge 
there 
is 
no 
satiety, 
but 
satisfaction 
and 
appetite 
are 
perpetually 
interchangeable; 
and, 
therefore, 
appeareth 
to 
be 
good 
in 
itself 
simply, 
without 
fallacy 
or 
accident. 
Neither 
is 
that 
pleasure 
of 
small 
efficacy 
and 
contentment 
to 
the 
mind 
of 
man, 
which 
the 
poet 
Lucretius 
describeth 
elegantly:— 


“Suave 
mari 
magno, 
turbantibus 
aequora 
ventis, 
&c.” 


“It 
is 
a 
view 
of 
delight,” 
saith 
he, 
“to 
stand 
or 
walk 
upon 
the 
shore 
side, 
and 
to 
see 
a 
ship 
tossed 
with 
tempest 
upon 
the 
sea; 
or 
to 
be 
in 
a 
fortified 
tower, 
and 
to 
see 
two 
battles 
join 
upon 
a 
plain. 
But 
it 
is 
a 
pleasure 
incomparable, 
for 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
to 
be 
settled, 
landed, 
and 
fortified 
in 
the 
certainty 
of 
truth; 
and 
from 
thence 
to 
descry 
and 
behold 
the 
errors, 
perturbations, 
labours, 
and 
wanderings 
up 
and 
down 
of 
other 
men. 


(6) 
Lastly, 
leaving 
the 
vulgar 
arguments, 
that 
by 
learning 
man 
excelleth 
man 
in 
that 
wherein 
man 
excelleth 
beasts; 
that 
by 
learning 
man 
ascendeth 
to 
the 
heavens 
and 
their 
motions, 
where 
in 
body 
he 
cannot 
come; 
and 
the 
like: 
let 
us 
conclude 
with 
the 
dignity 
and 
excellency 
of 
knowledge 
and 
learning 
in 
that 
whereunto 
man’s 
nature 
doth 
most 
aspire, 
which 
is 
immortality, 
or 
continuance; 
for 
to 
this 
tendeth 
generation, 
and 
raising 
of 
houses 
and 
families; 
to 
this 
tend 
buildings, 
foundations, 
and 
monuments; 
to 
this 
tendeth 
the 
desire 
of 
memory, 
fame, 
and 
celebration; 
and 
in 
effect 
the 
strength 
of 
all 
other 
human 
desires. 
We 
see 
then 
how 
far 
the 
monuments 
of 
wit 
and 
learning 
are 
more 
durable 
than 
the 
monuments 
of 
power 
or 
of 
the 
hands. 
For 
have 
not 
the 
verses 
of 
Homer 
continued 
twenty-five 
hundred 
years, 
or 
more, 
without 
the 
loss 
of 
a 
syllable 
or 
letter; 
during 
which 
the 
infinite 
palaces, 
temples, 
castles, 
cities, 
have 
been 
decayed 
and 
demolished? 
It 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
have 
the 
true 
pictures 
or 
statues 
of 
Cyrus, 
Alexander, 
Caesar, 
no 
nor 
of 
the 
kings 
or 
great 
personages 
of 
much 
later 
years; 
for 
the 
originals 
cannot 
last, 
and 
the 
copies 
cannot 
but 
leese 
of 
the 
life 
and 
truth. 
But 
the 
images 
of 
men’s 
wits 
and 
knowledges 
remain 
in 
books, 
exempted 
from 
the 
wrong 
of 
time 
and 
capable 
of 
perpetual 
renovation. 
Neither 
are 
they 
fitly 
to 
be 
called 
images, 
because 
they 
generate 
still, 
and 
cast 
their 
seeds 
in 
the 

minds 
of 
others, 
provoking 
and 
causing 
infinite 
actions 
and 
opinions 
in 
succeeding 
ages. 
So 
that 
if 
the 
invention 
of 
the 
ship 
was 
thought 
so 
noble, 
which 
carrieth 
riches 
and 
commodities 
from 
place 
to 
place, 
and 
consociateth 
the 
most 
remote 
regions 
in 
participation 
of 
their 
fruits, 
how 
much 
more 
are 
letters 
to 
be 
magnified, 
which 
as 
ships 
pass 
through 
the 
vast 
seas 
of 
time, 
and 
make 
ages 
so 
distant 
to 
participate 
of 
the 
wisdom, 
illuminations, 
and 
inventions, 
the 
one 
of 
the 
other? 
Nay, 
further, 
we 
see 
some 
of 
the 
philosophers 
which 
were 
least 
divine, 
and 
most 
immersed 
in 
the 
senses, 
and 
denied 
generally 
the 
immortality 
of 
the 
soul, 
yet 
came 
to 
this 
point, 
that 
whatsoever 
motions 
the 
spirit 
of 
man 
could 
act 
and 
perform 
without 
the 
organs 
of 
the 
body, 
they 
thought 
might 
remain 
after 
death, 
which 
were 
only 
those 
of 
the 
understanding 
and 
not 
of 
the 
affection; 
so 
immortal 
and 
incorruptible 
a 
thing 
did 
knowledge 
seem 
unto 
them 
to 
be. 
But 
we, 
that 
know 
by 
divine 
revelation 
that 
not 
only 
the 
understanding 
but 
the 
affections 
purified, 
not 
only 
the 
spirit 
but 
the 
body 
changed, 
shall 
be 
advanced 
to 
immortality, 
do 
disclaim 
in 
these 
rudiments 
of 
the 
senses. 
But 
it 
must 
be 
remembered, 
both 
in 
this 
last 
point, 
and 
so 
it 
may 
likewise 
be 
needful 
in 
other 
places, 
that 
in 
probation 
of 
the 
dignity 
of 
knowledge 
or 
learning, 
I 
did 
in 
the 
beginning 
separate 
divine 
testimony 
from 
human, 
which 
method 
I 
have 
pursued, 
and 
so 
handled 
them 
both 
apart. 


(7) 
Nevertheless 
I 
do 
not 
pretend, 
and 
I 
know 
it 
will 
be 
impossible 
for 
me, 
by 
any 
pleading 
of 
mine, 
to 
reverse 
the 
judgment, 
either 
of 
AEsop’s 
cock, 
that 
preferred 
the 
barleycorn 
before 
the 
gem; 
or 
of 
Midas, 
that 
being 
chosen 
judge 
between 
Apollo, 
president 
of 
the 
Muses, 
and 
Pan, 
god 
of 
the 
flocks, 
judged 
for 
plenty; 
or 
of 
Paris, 
that 
judged 
for 
beauty 
and 
love 
against 
wisdom 
and 
power; 
or 
of 
Agrippina, 
occidat 
matrem, 
modo 
imperet, 
that 
preferred 
empire 
with 
any 
condition 
never 
so 
detestable; 
or 
of 
Ulysses, 
qui 
vetulam 
praetulit 
immortalitati, 
being 
a 
figure 
of 
those 
which 
prefer 
custom 
and 
habit 
before 
all 
excellency, 
or 
of 
a 
number 
of 
the 
like 
popular 
judgments. 
For 
these 
things 
must 
continue 
as 
they 
have 
been; 
but 
so 
will 
that 
also 
continue 
whereupon 
learning 
hath 
ever 
relied, 
and 
which 
faileth 
not: 
Justificata 
est 
sapientia 
a 
filiis 
suis. 

The 
Second 
Book. 


To 
the 
King. 


1. 
It 
might 
seem 
to 
have 
more 
convenience, 
though 
it 
come 
often 
otherwise 
to 
pass 
(excellent 
King), 
that 
those 
which 
are 
fruitful 
in 
their 
generations, 
and 
have 
in 
themselves 
the 
foresight 
of 
immortality 
in 
their 
descendants, 
should 
likewise 
be 
more 
careful 
of 
the 
good 
estate 
of 
future 
times, 
unto 
which 
they 
know 
they 
must 
transmit 
and 
commend 
over 
their 
dearest 
pledges. 
Queen 
Elizabeth 
was 
a 
sojourner 
in 
the 
world 
in 
respect 
of 
her 
unmarried 
life, 
and 
was 
a 
blessing 
to 
her 
own 
times; 
and 
yet 
so 
as 
the 
impression 
of 
her 
good 
government, 
besides 
her 
happy 
memory, 
is 
not 
without 
some 
effect 
which 
doth 
survive 
her. 
But 
to 
your 
Majesty, 
whom 
God 
hath 
already 
blessed 
with 
so 
much 
royal 
issue, 
worthy 
to 
continue 
and 
represent 
you 
for 
ever, 
and 
whose 
youthful 
and 
fruitful 
bed 
doth 
yet 
promise 
many 
the 
like 
renovations, 
it 
is 
proper 
and 
agreeable 
to 
be 
conversant 
not 
only 
in 
the 
transitory 
parts 
of 
good 
government, 
but 
in 
those 
acts 
also 
which 
are 
in 
their 
nature 
permanent 
and 
perpetual. 
Amongst 
the 
which 
(if 
affection 
do 
not 
transport 
me) 
there 
is 
not 
any 
more 
worthy 
than 
the 
further 
endowment 
of 
the 
world 
with 
sound 
and 
fruitful 
knowledge. 
For 
why 
should 
a 
few 
received 
authors 
stand 
up 
like 
Hercules’ 
columns, 
beyond 
which 
there 
should 
be 
no 
sailing 
or 
discovering, 
since 
we 
have 
so 
bright 
and 
benign 
a 
star 
as 
your 
Majesty 
to 
conduct 
and 
prosper 
us? 
To 
return 
therefore 
where 
we 
left, 
it 
remaineth 
to 
consider 
of 
what 
kind 
those 
acts 
are 
which 
have 
been 
undertaken 
and 
performed 
by 
kings 
and 
others 
for 
the 
increase 
and 
advancement 
of 
learning, 
wherein 
I 
purpose 
to 
speak 
actively, 
without 
digressing 
or 
dilating. 
2. 
Let 
this 
ground 
therefore 
be 
laid, 
that 
all 
works 
are 
over 
common 
by 
amplitude 
of 
reward, 
by 
soundness 
of 
direction, 
and 
by 
the 
conjunction 
of 
labours. 
The 
first 
multiplieth 
endeavour, 
the 
second 
preventeth 
error, 
and 
the 
third 
supplieth 
the 
frailty 
of 
man. 
But 
the 
principal 
of 
these 
is 
direction, 
for 
claudus 
in 
via 
antevertit 
cursorem 
extra 
viam; 
and 
Solomon 
excellently 
setteth 
it 
down, 
“If 
the 
iron 
be 
not 
sharp, 
it 
requireth 
more 
strength, 
but 

wisdom 
is 
that 
which 
prevaileth,” 
signifying 
that 
the 
invention 
or 
election 
of 
the 
mean 
is 
more 
effectual 
than 
any 
enforcement 
or 
accumulation 
of 
endeavours. 
This 
I 
am 
induced 
to 
speak, 
for 
that 
(not 
derogating 
from 
the 
noble 
intention 
of 
any 
that 
have 
been 
deservers 
towards 
the 
state 
of 
learning), 
I 
do 
observe 
nevertheless 
that 
their 
works 
and 
acts 
are 
rather 
matters 
of 
magnificence 
and 
memory 
than 
of 
progression 
and 
proficience, 
and 
tend 
rather 
to 
augment 
the 
mass 
of 
learning 
in 
the 
multitude 
of 
learned 
men 
than 
to 
rectify 
or 
raise 
the 
sciences 
themselves. 


3. 
The 
works 
or 
acts 
of 
merit 
towards 
learning 
are 
conversant 
about 
three 
objects 
— 
the 
places 
of 
learning, 
the 
books 
of 
learning, 
and 
the 
persons 
of 
the 
learned. 
For 
as 
water, 
whether 
it 
be 
the 
dew 
of 
heaven 
or 
the 
springs 
of 
the 
earth, 
doth 
scatter 
and 
leese 
itself 
in 
the 
ground, 
except 
it 
be 
collected 
into 
some 
receptacle 
where 
it 
may 
by 
union 
comfort 
and 
sustain 
itself; 
and 
for 
that 
cause 
the 
industry 
of 
man 
hath 
made 
and 
framed 
springheads, 
conduits, 
cisterns, 
and 
pools, 
which 
men 
have 
accustomed 
likewise 
to 
beautify 
and 
adorn 
with 
accomplishments 
of 
magnificence 
and 
state, 
as 
well 
as 
of 
use 
and 
necessity; 
so 
this 
excellent 
liquor 
of 
knowledge, 
whether 
it 
descend 
from 
divine 
inspiration, 
or 
spring 
from 
human 
sense, 
would 
soon 
perish 
and 
vanish 
to 
oblivion, 
if 
it 
were 
not 
preserved 
in 
books, 
traditions, 
conferences, 
and 
places 
appointed, 
as 
universities, 
colleges, 
and 
schools, 
for 
the 
receipt 
and 
comforting 
of 
the 
same. 
4. 
The 
works 
which 
concern 
the 
seats 
and 
places 
of 
learning 
are 
four 
— 
foundations 
and 
buildings, 
endowments 
with 
revenues, 
endowments 
with 
franchises 
and 
privileges, 
institutions 
and 
ordinances 
for 
government 
— 
all 
tending 
to 
quietness 
and 
privateness 
of 
life, 
and 
discharge 
of 
cares 
and 
troubles; 
much 
like 
the 
stations 
which 
Virgil 
prescribeth 
for 
the 
hiving 
of 
bees:— 
“Principio 
sedes 
apibus 
statioque 
petenda, 
Quo 
neque 
sit 
ventis 
aditus, 
&c.” 


5. 
The 
works 
touching 
books 
are 
two 
— 
first, 
libraries, 
which 
are 
as 
the 
shrines 
where 
all 
the 
relics 
of 
the 
ancient 
saints, 
full 
of 
true 
virtue, 
and 
that 
without 
delusion 
or 
imposture, 
are 
preserved 
and 
reposed; 
secondly, 
new 
editions 
of 
authors, 
with 
more 
correct 
impressions, 
more 
faithful 
translations, 
more 
profitable 
glosses, 
more 
diligent 
annotations, 
and 
the 
like. 
6. 
The 
works 
pertaining 
to 
the 
persons 
of 
learned 
men 
(besides 
the 

advancement 
and 
countenancing 
of 
them 
in 
general) 
are 
two 
— 
the 
reward 
and 
designation 
of 
readers 
in 
sciences 
already 
extant 
and 
invented; 
and 
the 
reward 
and 
designation 
of 
writers 
and 
inquirers 
concerning 
any 
parts 
of 
learning 
not 
sufficiently 
laboured 
and 
prosecuted. 


7. 
These 
are 
summarily 
the 
works 
and 
acts 
wherein 
the 
merits 
of 
many 
excellent 
princes 
and 
other 
worthy 
personages, 
have 
been 
conversant. 
As 
for 
any 
particular 
commemorations, 
I 
call 
to 
mind 
what 
Cicero 
said 
when 
he 
gave 
general 
thanks, 
Difficile 
non 
aliquem, 
ingratum 
quenquam 
praeterire. 
Let 
us 
rather, 
according 
to 
the 
Scriptures, 
look 
unto 
that 
part 
of 
the 
race 
which 
is 
before 
us, 
than 
look 
back 
to 
that 
which 
is 
already 
attained. 
8. 
First, 
therefore, 
amongst 
so 
many 
great 
foundations 
of 
colleges 
in 
Europe, 
I 
find 
strange 
that 
they 
are 
all 
dedicated 
to 
professions, 
and 
none 
left 
free 
to 
arts 
and 
sciences 
at 
large. 
For 
if 
men 
judge 
that 
learning 
should 
be 
referred 
to 
action, 
they 
judge 
well; 
but 
in 
this 
they 
fall 
into 
the 
error 
described 
in 
the 
ancient 
fable, 
in 
which 
the 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
body 
did 
suppose 
the 
stomach 
had 
been 
idle, 
because 
it 
neither 
performed 
the 
office 
of 
motion, 
as 
the 
limbs 
do, 
nor 
of 
sense, 
as 
the 
head 
doth; 
but 
yet 
notwithstanding 
it 
is 
the 
stomach 
that 
digesteth 
and 
distributeth 
to 
all 
the 
rest. 
So 
if 
any 
man 
think 
philosophy 
and 
universality 
to 
be 
idle 
studies, 
he 
doth 
not 
consider 
that 
all 
professions 
are 
from 
thence 
served 
and 
supplied. 
And 
this 
I 
take 
to 
be 
a 
great 
cause 
that 
hath 
hindered 
the 
progression 
of 
learning, 
because 
these 
fundamental 
knowledges 
have 
been 
studied 
but 
in 
passage. 
For 
if 
you 
will 
have 
a 
tree 
bear 
more 
fruit 
than 
it 
hath 
used 
to 
do, 
it 
is 
not 
anything 
you 
can 
do 
to 
the 
boughs, 
but 
it 
is 
the 
stirring 
of 
the 
earth 
and 
putting 
new 
mould 
about 
thee 
roots 
that 
must 
work 
it. 
Neither 
is 
it 
to 
be 
forgotten, 
that 
this 
dedicating 
of 
foundations 
and 
dotations 
to 
professory 
learning 
hath 
not 
only 
had 
a 
malign 
aspect 
and 
influence 
upon 
the 
growth 
of 
sciences, 
but 
hath 
also 
been 
prejudicial 
to 
states, 
and 
governments. 
For 
hence 
it 
proceedeth 
that 
princes 
find 
a 
solitude 
in 
regard 
of 
able 
men 
to 
serve 
them 
in 
causes 
of 
estate, 
because 
there 
is 
no 
education 
collegiate 
which 
is 
free, 
where 
such 
as 
were 
so 
disposed 
might 
give 
themselves 
in 
histories, 
modern 
languages, 
books 
of 
policy 
and 
civil 
discourse, 
and 
other 
the 
like 
enablements 
unto 
service 
of 
estate. 
9. 
And 
because 
founders 
of 
colleges 
do 
plant, 
and 
founders 
of 
lectures 
do 
water, 
it 
followeth 
well 
in 
order 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
defect 
which 
is 
in 
public 
lectures; 
namely, 
in 
the 
smallness, 
and 
meanness 
of 
the 
salary 
or 

reward 
which 
in 
most 
places 
is 
assigned 
unto 
them, 
whether 
they 
be 
lectures 
of 
arts, 
or 
of 
professions. 
For 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
the 
progression 
of 
sciences 
that 
readers 
be 
of 
the 
most 
able 
and 
sufficient 
men; 
as 
those 
which 
are 
ordained 
for 
generating 
and 
propagating 
of 
sciences, 
and 
not 
for 
transitory 
use. 
This 
cannot 
be, 
except 
their 
condition 
and 
endowment 
be 
such 
as 
may 
content 
the 
ablest 
man 
to 
appropriate 
his 
whole 
labour 
and 
continue 
his 
whole 
age 
in 
that 
function 
and 
attendance; 
and 
therefore 
must 
have 
a 
proportion 
answerable 
to 
that 
mediocrity 
or 
competency 
of 
advancement, 
which 
may 
be 
expected 
from 
a 
profession 
or 
the 
practice 
of 
a 
profession. 
So 
as, 
if 
you 
will 
have 
sciences 
flourish, 
you 
must 
observe 
David’s 
military 
law, 
which 
was, 
“That 
those 
which 
stayed 
with 
the 
carriage 
should 
have 
equal 
part 
with 
those 
which 
were 
in 
the 
action;” 
else 
will 
the 
carriages 
be 
ill 
attended. 
So 
readers 
in 
sciences 
are 
indeed 
the 
guardians 
of 
the 
stores 
and 
provisions 
of 
sciences, 
whence 
men 
in 
active 
courses 
are 
furnished, 
and 
therefore 
ought 
to 
have 
equal 
entertainment 
with 
them; 
otherwise 
if 
the 
fathers 
in 
sciences 
be 
of 
the 
weakest 
sort 
or 
be 
ill 
maintained, 


“Et 
patrum 
invalidi 
referent 
jejunia 
nati.” 


10. 
Another 
defect 
I 
note, 
wherein 
I 
shall 
need 
some 
alchemist 
to 
help 
me, 
who 
call 
upon 
men 
to 
sell 
their 
books, 
and 
to 
build 
furnaces; 
quitting 
and 
forsaking 
Minerva 
and 
the 
Muses 
as 
barren 
virgins, 
and 
relying 
upon 
Vulcan. 
But 
certain 
it 
is, 
that 
unto 
the 
deep, 
fruitful, 
and 
operative 
study 
of 
many 
sciences, 
specialty 
natural 
philosophy 
and 
physic, 
books 
be 
not 
only 
the 
instrumentals; 
wherein 
also 
the 
beneficence 
of 
men 
hath 
not 
been 
altogether 
wanting. 
For 
we 
see 
spheres, 
globes, 
astrolabes, 
maps, 
and 
the 
like, 
have 
been 
provided 
as 
appurtenances 
to 
astronomy 
and 
cosmography, 
as 
well 
as 
books. 
We 
see 
likewise 
that 
some 
places 
instituted 
for 
physic 
have 
annexed 
the 
commodity 
of 
gardens 
for 
simples 
of 
all 
sorts, 
and 
do 
likewise 
command 
the 
use 
of 
dead 
bodies 
for 
anatomies. 
But 
these 
do 
respect 
but 
a 
few 
things. 
In 
general, 
there 
will 
hardly 
be 
any 
main 
proficience 
in 
the 
disclosing 
of 
nature, 
except 
there 
be 
some 
allowance 
for 
expenses 
about 
experiments; 
whether 
they 
be 
experiments 
appertaining 
to 
Vulcanus 
or 
Daedalus, 
furnace 
or 
engine, 
or 
any 
other 
kind. 
And 
therefore 
as 
secretaries 
and 
spials 
of 
princes 
and 
states 
bring 
in 
bills 
for 
intelligence, 
so 
you 
must 
allow 
the 
spials 
and 
intelligencers 
of 
nature 
to 
bring 
in 
their 
bills; 
or 
else 
you 
shall 
be 
ill 
advertised. 
11. 
And 
if 
Alexander 
made 
such 
a 
liberal 
assignation 
to 
Aristotle 
of 

treasure 
for 
the 
allowance 
of 
hunters, 
fowlers, 
fishers, 
and 
the 
like, 
that 
he 
might 
compile 
a 
history 
of 
nature, 
much 
better 
do 
they 
deserve 
it 
that 
travail 
in 
arts 
of 
nature. 


12. 
Another 
defect 
which 
I 
note 
is 
an 
intermission 
or 
neglect 
in 
those 
which 
are 
governors 
in 
universities, 
of 
consultation, 
and 
in 
princes 
or 
superior 
persons, 
of 
visitation: 
to 
enter 
into 
account 
and 
consideration, 
whether 
the 
readings, 
exercises, 
and 
other 
customs 
appertaining 
unto 
learning, 
anciently 
begun 
and 
since 
continued, 
be 
well 
instituted 
or 
no; 
and 
thereupon 
to 
ground 
an 
amendment 
or 
reformation 
in 
that 
which 
shall 
be 
found 
inconvenient. 
For 
it 
is 
one 
of 
your 
Majesty’s 
own 
most 
wise 
and 
princely 
maxims, 
“That 
in 
all 
usages 
and 
precedents, 
the 
times 
be 
considered 
wherein 
they 
first 
began; 
which 
if 
they 
were 
weak 
or 
ignorant, 
it 
derogateth 
from 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
usage, 
and 
leaveth 
it 
for 
suspect.” 
And 
therefore 
inasmuch 
as 
most 
of 
the 
usages 
and 
orders 
of 
the 
universities 
were 
derived 
from 
more 
obscure 
times, 
it 
is 
the 
more 
requisite 
they 
be 
re-examined. 
In 
this 
kind 
I 
will 
give 
an 
instance 
or 
two, 
for 
example 
sake, 
of 
things 
that 
are 
the 
most 
obvious 
and 
familiar. 
The 
one 
is 
a 
matter, 
which 
though 
it 
be 
ancient 
and 
general, 
yet 
I 
hold 
to 
be 
an 
error; 
which 
is, 
that 
scholars 
in 
universities 
come 
too 
soon 
and 
too 
unripe 
to 
logic 
and 
rhetoric, 
arts 
fitter 
for 
graduates 
than 
children 
and 
novices. 
For 
these 
two, 
rightly 
taken, 
are 
the 
gravest 
of 
sciences, 
being 
the 
arts 
of 
arts; 
the 
one 
for 
judgment, 
the 
other 
for 
ornament. 
And 
they 
be 
the 
rules 
and 
directions 
how 
to 
set 
forth 
and 
dispose 
matter: 
and 
therefore 
for 
minds 
empty 
and 
unfraught 
with 
matter, 
and 
which 
have 
not 
gathered 
that 
which 
Cicero 
calleth 
sylva 
and 
supellex, 
stuff 
and 
variety, 
to 
begin 
with 
those 
arts 
(as 
if 
one 
should 
learn 
to 
weigh, 
or 
to 
measure, 
or 
to 
paint 
the 
wind) 
doth 
work 
but 
this 
effect, 
that 
the 
wisdom 
of 
those 
arts, 
which 
is 
great 
and 
universal, 
is 
almost 
made 
contemptible, 
and 
is 
degenerate 
into 
childish 
sophistry 
and 
ridiculous 
affectation. 
And 
further, 
the 
untimely 
learning 
of 
them 
hath 
drawn 
on 
by 
consequence 
the 
superficial 
and 
unprofitable 
teaching 
and 
writing 
of 
them, 
as 
fitteth 
indeed 
to 
the 
capacity 
of 
children. 
Another 
is 
a 
lack 
I 
find 
in 
the 
exercises 
used 
in 
the 
universities, 
which 
do 
snake 
too 
great 
a 
divorce 
between 
invention 
and 
memory. 
For 
their 
speeches 
are 
either 
premeditate, 
in 
verbis 
conceptis, 
where 
nothing 
is 
left 
to 
invention, 
or 
merely 
extemporal, 
where 
little 
is 
left 
to 
memory. 
Whereas 
in 
life 
and 
action 
there 
is 
least 
use 
of 
either 
of 
these, 
but 
rather 
of 
intermixtures 
of 
premeditation 
and 
invention, 
notes 
and 
memory. 
So 
as 
the 
exercise 
fitteth 
not 
the 
practice, 
nor 
the 
image 
the 
life; 
and 
it 
is 
ever 
a 
true 
rule 
in 
exercises, 

that 
they 
be 
framed 
as 
near 
as 
may 
be 
to 
the 
life 
of 
practice; 
for 
otherwise 
they 
do 
pervert 
the 
motions 
and 
faculties 
of 
the 
mind, 
and 
not 
prepare 
them. 
The 
truth 
whereof 
is 
not 
obscure, 
when 
scholars 
come 
to 
the 
practices 
of 
professions, 
or 
other 
actions 
of 
civil 
life; 
which 
when 
they 
set 
into, 
this 
want 
is 
soon 
found 
by 
themselves, 
and 
sooner 
by 
others. 
But 
this 
part, 
touching 
the 
amendment 
of 
the 
institutions 
and 
orders 
of 
universities, 
I 
will 
conclude 
with 
the 
clause 
of 
Caesar’s 
letter 
to 
Oppius 
and 
Balbes, 
Hoc 
quemadmodum 
fieri 
possit, 
nonnulla 
mihi 
in 
mentem 
veniunt, 
et 
multa 
reperiri 
possunt: 
de 
iis 
rebus 
rgo 
vos 
ut 
cogitationem 
suscipiatis. 


13. 
Another 
defect 
which 
I 
note 
ascendeth 
a 
little 
higher 
than 
the 
precedent. 
For 
as 
the 
proficience 
of 
learning 
consisteth 
much 
in 
the 
orders 
and 
institutions 
of 
universities 
in 
the 
same 
states 
and 
kingdoms, 
so 
it 
would 
be 
yet 
more 
advanced, 
if 
there 
were 
more 
intelligence 
mutual 
between 
the 
universities 
of 
Europe 
than 
now 
there 
is. 
We 
see 
there 
be 
many 
orders 
and 
foundations, 
which 
though 
they 
be 
divided 
under 
several 
sovereignties 
and 
territories, 
yet 
they 
take 
themselves 
to 
have 
a 
kind 
of 
contract, 
fraternity, 
and 
correspondence 
one 
with 
the 
other, 
insomuch 
as 
they 
have 
provincials 
and 
generals. 
And 
surely 
as 
nature 
createth 
brotherhood 
in 
families, 
and 
arts 
mechanical 
contract 
brotherhoods 
in 
communalties, 
and 
the 
anointment 
of 
God 
superinduceth 
a 
brotherhood 
in 
kings 
and 
bishops, 
so 
in 
like 
manner 
there 
cannot 
but 
be 
a 
fraternity 
in 
learning 
and 
illumination, 
relating 
to 
that 
paternity 
which 
is 
attributed 
to 
God, 
who 
is 
called 
the 
Father 
of 
illuminations 
or 
lights. 
14. 
The 
last 
defect 
which 
I 
will 
note 
is, 
that 
there 
hath 
not 
been, 
or 
very 
rarely 
been, 
any 
public 
designation 
of 
writers 
or 
inquirers 
concerning 
such 
parts 
of 
knowledge 
as 
may 
appear 
not 
to 
have 
been 
already 
sufficiently 
laboured 
or 
undertaken; 
unto 
which 
point 
it 
is 
an 
inducement 
to 
enter 
into 
a 
view 
and 
examination 
what 
parts 
of 
learning 
have 
been 
prosecuted, 
and 
what 
omitted. 
For 
the 
opinion 
of 
plenty 
is 
amongst 
the 
causes 
of 
want, 
and 
the 
great 
quantity 
of 
books 
maketh 
a 
show 
rather 
of 
superfluity 
than 
lack; 
which 
surcharge 
nevertheless 
is 
not 
to 
be 
remedied 
by 
making 
no 
more 
books, 
but 
by 
making 
more 
good 
books, 
which, 
as 
the 
serpent 
of 
Moses, 
might 
devour 
the 
serpents 
of 
the 
enchanters. 
15. 
The 
removing 
of 
all 
the 
defects 
formerly 
enumerate, 
except 
the 
last, 
and 
of 
the 
active 
part 
also 
of 
the 
last 
(which 
is 
the 
designation 
of 
writers), 
are 
opera 
basilica; 
towards 
which 
the 
endeavours 
of 
a 
private 
man 

may 
be 
but 
as 
an 
image 
in 
a 
crossway, 
that 
may 
point 
at 
the 
way, 
but 
cannot 
go 
it. 
But 
the 
inducing 
part 
of 
the 
latter 
(which 
is 
the 
survey 
of 
learning) 
may 
be 
set 
forward 
by 
private 
travail. 
Wherefore 
I 
will 
now 
attempt 
to 
make 
a 
general 
and 
faithful 
perambulation 
of 
learning, 
with 
an 
inquiry 
what 
parts 
thereof 
lie 
fresh 
and 
waste, 
and 
not 
improved 
and 
converted 
by 
the 
industry 
of 
man, 
to 
the 
end 
that 
such 
a 
plot 
made 
and 
recorded 
to 
memory 
may 
both 
minister 
light 
to 
any 
public 
designation, 
and, 
also 
serve 
to 
excite 
voluntary 
endeavours. 
Wherein, 
nevertheless, 
my 
purpose 
is 
at 
this 
time 
to 
note 
only 
omissions 
and 
deficiences, 
and 
not 
to 
make 
any 
redargution 
of 
errors 
or 
incomplete 
prosecutions. 
For 
it 
is 
one 
thing 
to 
set 
forth 
what 
ground 
lieth 
unmanured, 
and 
another 
thing 
to 
correct 
ill 
husbandry 
in 
that 
which 
is 
manured. 


In 
the 
handling 
and 
undertaking 
of 
which 
work 
I 
am 
not 
ignorant 
what 
it 
is 
that 
I 
do 
now 
move 
and 
attempt, 
nor 
insensible 
of 
mine 
own 
weakness 
to 
sustain 
my 
purpose. 
But 
my 
hope 
is, 
that 
if 
my 
extreme 
love 
to 
learning 
carry 
me 
too 
far, 
I 
may 
obtain 
the 
excuse 
of 
affection; 
for 
that 
“It 
is 
not 
granted 
to 
man 
to 
love 
and 
to 
be 
wise.” 
But 
I 
know 
well 
I 
can 
use 
no 
other 
liberty 
of 
judgment 
than 
I 
must 
leave 
to 
others; 
and 
I 
for 
my 
part 
shall 
be 
indifferently 
glad 
either 
to 
perform 
myself, 
or 
accept 
from 
another, 
that 
duty 
of 
humanity 
— 
Nam 
qui 
erranti 
comiter 
monstrat 
viam, 
&c. 
I 
do 
foresee 
likewise 
that 
of 
those 
things 
which 
I 
shall 
enter 
and 
register 
as 
deficiences 
and 
omissions, 
many 
will 
conceive 
and 
censure 
that 
some 
of 
them 
are 
already 
done 
and 
extant; 
others 
to 
be 
but 
curiosities, 
and 
things 
of 
no 
great 
use; 
and 
others 
to 
be 
of 
too 
great 
difficulty, 
and 
almost 
impossibility 
to 
be 
compassed 
and 
effected. 
But 
for 
the 
two 
first, 
I 
refer 
myself 
to 
the 
particulars. 
For 
the 
last, 
touching 
impossibility, 
I 
take 
it 
those 
things 
are 
to 
be 
held 
possible 
which 
may 
be 
done 
by 
some 
person, 
though 
not 
by 
every 
one; 
and 
which 
may 
be 
done 
by 
many, 
though 
not 
by 
any 
one; 
and 
which 
may 
be 
done 
in 
the 
succession 
of 
ages, 
though 
not 
within 
the 
hourglass 
of 
one 
man’s 
life; 
and 
which 
may 
be 
done 
by 
public 
designation, 
though 
not 
by 
private 
endeavour. 
But, 
notwithstanding, 
if 
any 
man 
will 
take 
to 
himself 
rather 
that 
of 
Solomon, 
“Dicit 
piger, 
Leo 
est 
in 
via,” 
than 
that 
of 
Virgil, 
“Possunt 
quia 
posse 
videntur,” 
I 
shall 
be 
content 
that 
my 
labours 
be 
esteemed 
but 
as 
the 
better 
sort 
of 
wishes; 
for 
as 
it 
asketh 
some 
knowledge 
to 
demand 
a 
question 
not 
impertinent, 
so 
it 
requireth 
some 
sense 
to 
make 
a 
wish 
not 
absurd. 



 
I 


(1) 
The 
parts 
of 
human 
learning 
have 
reference 
to 
the 
three 
parts 
of 
man’s 
understanding, 
which 
is 
the 
seat 
of 
learning: 
history 
to 
his 
memory, 
poesy 
to 
his 
imagination, 
and 
philosophy 
to 
his 
reason. 
Divine 
learning 
receiveth 
the 
same 
distribution; 
for, 
the 
spirit 
of 
man 
is 
the 
same, 
though 
the 
revelation 
of 
oracle 
and 
sense 
be 
diverse. 
So 
as 
theology 
consisteth 
also 
of 
history 
of 
the 
Church; 
of 
parables, 
which 
is 
divine 
poesy; 
and 
of 
holy 
doctrine 
or 
precept. 
For 
as 
for 
that 
part 
which 
seemeth 
supernumerary, 
which 
is 
prophecy, 
it 
is 
but 
divine 
history, 
which 
hath 
that 
prerogative 
over 
human, 
as 
the 
narration 
may 
be 
before 
the 
fact 
as 
well 
as 
after. 
(2) 
History 
is 
natural, 
civil, 
ecclesiastical, 
and 
literary; 
whereof 
the 
first 
three 
I 
allow 
as 
extant, 
the 
fourth 
I 
note 
as 
deficient. 
For 
no 
man 
hath 
propounded 
to 
himself 
the 
general 
state 
of 
learning 
to 
be 
described 
and 
represented 
from 
age 
to 
age, 
as 
many 
have 
done 
the 
works 
of 
Nature, 
and 
the 
state, 
civil 
and 
ecclesiastical; 
without 
which 
the 
history 
of 
the 
world 
seemeth 
to 
me 
to 
be 
as 
the 
statue 
of 
Polyphemus 
with 
his 
eye 
out, 
that 
part 
being 
wanting 
which 
doth 
most 
show 
the 
spirit 
and 
life 
of 
the 
person. 
And 
yet 
I 
am 
not 
ignorant 
that 
in 
divers 
particular 
sciences, 
as 
of 
the 
jurisconsults, 
the 
mathematicians, 
the 
rhetoricians, 
the 
philosophers, 
there 
are 
set 
down 
some 
small 
memorials 
of 
the 
schools, 
authors, 
and 
books; 
and 
so 
likewise 
some 
barren 
relations 
touching 
the 
invention 
of 
arts 
or 
usages. 
But 
a 
just 
story 
of 
learning, 
containing 
the 
antiquities 
and 
originals 
of 
knowledges 
and 
their 
sects, 
their 
inventions, 
their 
traditions, 
their 
diverse 
administrations 
and 
managings, 
their 
flourishings, 
their 
oppositions, 
decays, 
depressions, 
oblivions, 
removes, 
with 
the 
causes 
and 
occasions 
of 
them, 
and 
all 
other 
events 
concerning 
learning, 
throughout 
the 
ages 
of 
the 
world, 
I 
may 
truly 
affirm 
to 
be 
wanting; 
the 
use 
and 
end 
of 
which 
work 
I 
do 
not 
so 
much 
design 
for 
curiosity 
or 
satisfaction 
of 
those 
that 
are 
the 
lovers 
of 
learning, 
but 
chiefly 
for 
a 
more 
serious 
and 
grave 
purpose, 
which 
is 
this 
in 
few 
words, 
that 
it 
will 
make 
learned 
men 
wise 
in 
the 
use 
and 
administration 
of 
learning. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
Saint 
Augustine’s 
nor 
Saint 
Ambrose’s 
works 
that 
will 
make 
so 
wise 
a 
divine 
as 
ecclesiastical 
history 
thoroughly 
read 
and 
observed, 
and 
the 
same 
reason 
is 
of 
learning. 

(3) 
History 
of 
Nature 
is 
of 
three 
sorts; 
of 
Nature 
in 
course, 
of 
Nature 
erring 
or 
varying, 
and 
of 
Nature 
altered 
or 
wrought; 
that 
is, 
history 
of 
creatures, 
history 
of 
marvels, 
and 
history 
of 
arts. 
The 
first 
of 
these 
no 
doubt 
is 
extant, 
and 
that 
in 
good 
perfection; 
the 
two 
latter 
are 
bandied 
so 
weakly 
and 
unprofitably 
as 
I 
am 
moved 
to 
note 
them 
as 
deficient. 
For 
I 
find 
no 
sufficient 
or 
competent 
collection 
of 
the 
works 
of 
Nature 
which 
have 
a 
digression 
and 
deflexion 
from 
the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
generations, 
productions, 
and 
motions; 
whether 
they 
be 
singularities 
of 
place 
and 
region, 
or 
the 
strange 
events 
of 
time 
and 
chance, 
or 
the 
effects 
of 
yet 
unknown 
properties, 
or 
the 
instances 
of 
exception 
to 
general 
kinds. 
It 
is 
true 
I 
find 
a 
number 
of 
books 
of 
fabulous 
experiments 
and 
secrets, 
and 
frivolous 
impostures 
for 
pleasure 
and 
strangeness; 
but 
a 
substantial 
and 
severe 
collection 
of 
the 
heteroclites 
or 
irregulars 
of 
Nature, 
well 
examined 
and 
described, 
I 
find 
not, 
specially 
not 
with 
due 
rejection 
of 
fables 
and 
popular 
errors. 
For 
as 
things 
now 
are, 
if 
an 
untruth 
in 
Nature 
be 
once 
on 
foot, 
what 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
neglect 
of 
examination, 
and 
countenance 
of 
antiquity, 
and 
what 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
use 
of 
the 
opinion 
in 
similitudes 
and 
ornaments 
of 
speech, 
it 
is 
never 
called 
down. 
(4) 
The 
use 
of 
this 
work, 
honoured 
with 
a 
precedent 
in 
Aristotle, 
is 
nothing 
less 
than 
to 
give 
contentment 
to 
the 
appetite 
of 
curious 
and 
vain 
wits, 
as 
the 
manner 
of 
Mirabilaries 
is 
to 
do; 
but 
for 
two 
reasons, 
both 
of 
great 
weight: 
the 
one 
to 
correct 
the 
partiality 
of 
axioms 
and 
opinions, 
which 
are 
commonly 
framed 
only 
upon 
common 
and 
familiar 
examples; 
the 
other 
because 
from 
the 
wonders 
of 
Nature 
is 
the 
nearest 
intelligence 
and 
passage 
towards 
the 
wonders 
of 
art, 
for 
it 
is 
no 
more 
but 
by 
following 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
hounding 
Nature 
in 
her 
wanderings, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
lead 
her 
afterwards 
to 
the 
same 
place 
again. 
Neither 
am 
I 
of 
opinion, 
in 
this 
history 
of 
marvels, 
that 
superstitious 
narrations 
of 
sorceries, 
witchcrafts, 
dreams, 
divinations, 
and 
the 
like, 
where 
there 
is 
an 
assurance 
and 
clear 
evidence 
of 
the 
fact, 
be 
altogether 
excluded. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
yet 
known 
in 
what 
cases 
and 
how 
far 
effects 
attributed 
to 
superstition 
do 
participate 
of 
natural 
causes; 
and, 
therefore, 
howsoever 
the 
practice 
of 
such 
things 
is 
to 
be 
condemned, 
yet 
from 
the 
speculation 
and 
consideration 
of 
them 
light 
may 
be 
taken, 
not 
only 
for 
the 
discerning 
of 
the 
offences, 
but 
for 
the 
further 
disclosing 
of 
Nature. 
Neither 
ought 
a 
man 
to 
make 
scruple 
of 
entering 
into 
these 
things 
for 
inquisition 
of 
truth, 
as 
your 
Majesty 
hath 
showed 
in 
your 
own 
example, 
who, 
with 
the 
two 
clear 
eyes 
of 
religion 
and 
natural 
philosophy, 
have 
looked 
deeply 
and 
wisely 
into 
these 
shadows, 
and 
yet 
proved 
yourself 
to 
be 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
sun, 
which 

passeth 
through 
pollutions 
and 
itself 
remains 
as 
pure 
as 
before. 
But 
this 
I 
hold 
fit, 
that 
these 
narrations, 
which 
have 
mixture 
with 
superstition, 
be 
sorted 
by 
themselves, 
and 
not 
to 
be 
mingled 
with 
the 
narrations 
which 
are 
merely 
and 
sincerely 
natural. 
But 
as 
for 
the 
narrations 
touching 
the 
prodigies 
and 
miracles 
of 
religions, 
they 
are 
either 
not 
true 
or 
not 
natural; 
and, 
therefore, 
impertinent 
for 
the 
story 
of 
Nature. 


(5) 
For 
history 
of 
Nature, 
wrought 
or 
mechanical, 
I 
find 
some 
collections 
made 
of 
agriculture, 
and 
likewise 
of 
manual 
arts; 
but 
commonly 
with 
a 
rejection 
of 
experiments 
familiar 
and 
vulgar; 
for 
it 
is 
esteemed 
a 
kind 
of 
dishonour 
unto 
learning 
to 
descend 
to 
inquiry 
or 
meditation 
upon 
matters 
mechanical, 
except 
they 
be 
such 
as 
may 
be 
thought 
secrets, 
rarities, 
and 
special 
subtleties; 
which 
humour 
of 
vain 
and 
supercilious 
arrogancy 
is 
justly 
derided 
in 
Plato, 
where 
he 
brings 
in 
Hippias, 
a 
vaunting 
sophist, 
disputing 
with 
Socrates, 
a 
true 
and 
unfeigned 
inquisitor 
of 
truth; 
where, 
the 
subject 
being 
touching 
beauty, 
Socrates, 
after 
his 
wandering 
manner 
of 
inductions, 
put 
first 
an 
example 
of 
a 
fair 
virgin, 
and 
then 
of 
a 
fair 
horse, 
and 
then 
of 
a 
fair 
pot 
well 
glazed, 
whereat 
Hippias 
was 
offended, 
and 
said, 
“More 
than 
for 
courtesy’s 
sake, 
he 
did 
think 
much 
to 
dispute 
with 
any 
that 
did 
allege 
such 
base 
and 
sordid 
instances.” 
Whereunto 
Socrates 
answereth, 
“You 
have 
reason, 
and 
it 
becomes 
you 
well, 
being 
a 
man 
so 
trim 
in 
your 
vestments,” 
&c., 
and 
so 
goeth 
on 
in 
an 
irony. 
But 
the 
truth 
is, 
they 
be 
not 
the 
highest 
instances 
that 
give 
the 
securest 
information, 
as 
may 
be 
well 
expressed 
in 
the 
tale 
so 
common 
of 
the 
philosopher 
that, 
while 
he 
gazed 
upwards 
to 
the 
stars, 
fell 
into 
the 
water; 
for 
if 
he 
had 
looked 
down 
he 
might 
have 
seen 
the 
stars 
in 
the 
water, 
but 
looking 
aloft 
he 
could 
not 
see 
the 
water 
in 
the 
stars. 
So 
it 
cometh 
often 
to 
pass 
that 
mean 
and 
small 
things 
discover 
great, 
better 
than 
great 
can 
discover 
the 
small; 
and 
therefore 
Aristotle 
noteth 
well, 
“That 
the 
nature 
of 
everything 
is 
best 
seen 
in 
his 
smallest 
portions.” 
And 
for 
that 
cause 
he 
inquireth 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
commonwealth, 
first 
in 
a 
family, 
and 
the 
simple 
conjugations 
of 
man 
and 
wife, 
parent 
and 
child, 
master 
and 
servant, 
which 
are 
in 
every 
cottage. 
Even 
so 
likewise 
the 
nature 
of 
this 
great 
city 
of 
the 
world, 
and 
the 
policy 
thereof, 
must 
be 
first 
sought 
in 
mean 
concordances 
and 
small 
portions. 
So 
we 
see 
how 
that 
secret 
of 
Nature, 
of 
the 
turning 
of 
iron 
touched 
with 
the 
loadstone 
towards 
the 
north, 
was 
found 
out 
in 
needles 
of 
iron, 
not 
in 
bars 
of 
iron. 
(6) 
But 
if 
my 
judgment 
be 
of 
any 
weight, 
the 
use 
of 
history 

mechanical 
is 
of 
all 
others 
the 
most 
radical 
and 
fundamental 
towards 
natural 
philosophy; 
such 
natural 
philosophy 
as 
shall 
not 
vanish 
in 
the 
fume 
of 
subtle, 
sublime, 
or 
delectable 
speculation, 
but 
such 
as 
shall 
be 
operative 
to 
the 
endowment 
and 
benefit 
of 
man’s 
life. 
For 
it 
will 
not 
only 
minister 
and 
suggest 
for 
the 
present 
many 
ingenious 
practices 
in 
all 
trades, 
by 
a 
connection 
and 
transferring 
of 
the 
observations 
of 
one 
art 
to 
the 
use 
of 
another, 
when 
the 
experiences 
of 
several 
mysteries 
shall 
fall 
under 
the 
consideration 
of 
one 
man’s 
mind; 
but 
further, 
it 
will 
give 
a 
more 
true 
and 
real 
illumination 
concerning 
causes 
and 
axioms 
than 
is 
hitherto 
attained. 
For 
like 
as 
a 
man’s 
disposition 
is 
never 
well 
known 
till 
he 
be 
crossed, 
nor 
Proteus 
ever 
changed 
shapes 
till 
he 
was 
straitened 
and 
held 
fast; 
so 
the 
passages 
and 
variations 
of 
nature 
cannot 
appear 
so 
fully 
in 
the 
liberty 
of 
nature 
as 
in 
the 
trials 
and 
vexations 
of 
art. 



II 


(1) 
For 
civil 
history, 
it 
is 
of 
three 
kinds; 
not 
unfitly 
to 
be 
compared 
with 
the 
three 
kinds 
of 
pictures 
or 
images. 
For 
of 
pictures 
or 
images 
we 
see 
some 
are 
unfinished, 
some 
are 
perfect, 
and 
some 
are 
defaced. 
So 
of 
histories 
we 
may 
find 
three 
kinds: 
memorials, 
perfect 
histories, 
and 
antiquities; 
for 
memorials 
are 
history 
unfinished, 
or 
the 
first 
or 
rough 
drafts 
of 
history; 
and 
antiquities 
are 
history 
defaced, 
or 
some 
remnants 
of 
history 
which 
have 
casually 
escaped 
the 
shipwreck 
of 
time. 
(2) 
Memorials, 
or 
preparatory 
history, 
are 
of 
two 
sorts; 
whereof 
the 
one 
may 
be 
termed 
commentaries, 
and 
the 
other 
registers. 
Commentaries 
are 
they 
which 
set 
down 
a 
continuance 
of 
the 
naked 
events 
and 
actions, 
without 
the 
motives 
or 
designs, 
the 
counsels, 
the 
speeches, 
the 
pretexts, 
the 
occasions, 
and 
other 
passages 
of 
action. 
For 
this 
is 
the 
true 
nature 
of 
a 
commentary 
(though 
Caesar, 
in 
modesty 
mixed 
with 
greatness, 
did 
for 
his 
pleasure 
apply 
the 
name 
of 
a 
commentary 
to 
the 
best 
history 
of 
the 
world). 
Registers 
are 
collections 
of 
public 
acts, 
as 
decrees 
of 
council, 
judicial 
proceedings, 
declarations 
and 
letters 
of 
estate, 
orations, 
and 
the 
like, 
without 
a 
perfect 
continuance 
or 
contexture 
of 
the 
thread 
of 
the 
narration. 
(3) 
Antiquities, 
or 
remnants 
of 
history, 
are, 
as 
was 
said, 
tanquam 
tabula 
naufragii: 
when 
industrious 
persons, 
by 
an 
exact 
and 
scrupulous 
diligence 
and 
observation, 
out 
of 
monuments, 
names, 
words, 
proverbs, 
traditions, 
private 
records 
and 
evidences, 
fragments 
of 
stories, 
passages 
of 
books 
that 
concern 
not 
story, 
and 
the 
like, 
do 
save 
and 
recover 
somewhat 
from 
the 
deluge 
of 
time. 
(4) 
In 
these 
kinds 
of 
unperfect 
histories 
I 
do 
assign 
no 
deficience, 
for 
they 
are 
tanquam 
imperfecte 
mista; 
and 
therefore 
any 
deficience 
in 
them 
is 
but 
their 
nature. 
As 
for 
the 
corruptions 
and 
moths 
of 
history, 
which 
are 
epitomes, 
the 
use 
of 
them 
deserveth 
to 
be 
banished, 
as 
all 
men 
of 
sound 
judgment 
have 
confessed, 
as 
those 
that 
have 
fretted 
and 
corroded 
the 
sound 
bodies 
of 
many 
excellent 
histories, 
and 
wrought 
them 
into 
base 
and 
unprofitable 
dregs. 
(5) 
History, 
which 
may 
be 
called 
just 
and 
perfect 
history, 
is 
of 
three 

kinds, 
according 
to 
the 
object 
which 
it 
propoundeth, 
or 
pretendeth 
to 
represent: 
for 
it 
either 
representeth 
a 
time, 
or 
a 
person, 
or 
an 
action. 
The 
first 
we 
call 
chronicles, 
the 
second 
lives, 
and 
the 
third 
narrations 
or 
relations. 
Of 
these, 
although 
the 
first 
be 
the 
most 
complete 
and 
absolute 
kind 
of 
history, 
and 
hath 
most 
estimation 
and 
glory, 
yet 
the 
second 
excelleth 
it 
in 
profit 
and 
use, 
and 
the 
third 
in 
verity 
and 
sincerity. 
For 
history 
of 
times 
representeth 
the 
magnitude 
of 
actions, 
and 
the 
public 
faces 
and 
deportments 
of 
persons, 
and 
passeth 
over 
in 
silence 
the 
smaller 
passages 
and 
motions 
of 
men 
and 
matters. 
But 
such 
being 
the 
workmanship 
of 
God, 
as 
He 
doth 
hang 
the 
greatest 
weight 
upon 
the 
smallest 
wires, 
maxima 
e 
minimis, 
suspendens, 
it 
comes 
therefore 
to 
pass, 
that 
such 
histories 
do 
rather 
set 
forth 
the 
pomp 
of 
business 
than 
the 
true 
and 
inward 
resorts 
thereof. 
But 
lives, 
if 
they 
be 
well 
written, 
propounding 
to 
themselves 
a 
person 
to 
represent, 
in 
whom 
actions, 
both 
greater 
and 
smaller, 
public 
and 
private, 
have 
a 
commixture, 
must 
of 
necessity 
contain 
a 
more 
true, 
native, 
and 
lively 
representation. 
So 
again 
narrations 
and 
relations 
of 
actions, 
as 
the 
war 
of 
Peloponnesus, 
the 
expedition 
of 
Cyrus 
Minor, 
the 
conspiracy 
of 
Catiline, 
cannot 
but 
be 
more 
purely 
and 
exactly 
true 
than 
histories 
of 
times, 
because 
they 
may 
choose 
an 
argument 
comprehensible 
within 
the 
notice 
and 
instructions 
of 
the 
writer: 
whereas 
he 
that 
undertaketh 
the 
story 
of 
a 
time, 
specially 
of 
any 
length, 
cannot 
but 
meet 
with 
many 
blanks 
and 
spaces, 
which 
he 
must 
be 
forced 
to 
fill 
up 
out 
of 
his 
own 
wit 
and 
conjecture. 


(6) 
For 
the 
history 
of 
times, 
I 
mean 
of 
civil 
history, 
the 
providence 
of 
God 
hath 
made 
the 
distribution. 
For 
it 
hath 
pleased 
God 
to 
ordain 
and 
illustrate 
two 
exemplar 
states 
of 
the 
world 
for 
arms, 
learning, 
moral 
virtue, 
policy, 
and 
laws; 
the 
state 
of 
Graecia 
and 
the 
state 
of 
Rome; 
the 
histories 
whereof 
occupying 
the 
middle 
part 
of 
time, 
have 
more 
ancient 
to 
them 
histories 
which 
may 
by 
one 
common 
name 
be 
termed 
the 
antiquities 
of 
the 
world; 
and 
after 
them, 
histories 
which 
may 
be 
likewise 
called 
by 
the 
name 
of 
modern 
history. 
(7) 
Now 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
deficiences. 
As 
to 
the 
heathen 
antiquities 
of 
the 
world 
it 
is 
in 
vain 
to 
note 
them 
for 
deficient. 
Deficient 
they 
are 
no 
doubt, 
consisting 
most 
of 
fables 
and 
fragments; 
but 
the 
deficience 
cannot 
be 
holpen; 
for 
antiquity 
is 
like 
fame, 
caput 
inter 
nubila 
condit, 
her 
head 
is 
muffled 
from 
our 
sight. 
For 
the 
history 
of 
the 
exemplar 
states, 
it 
is 
extant 
in 
good 
perfection. 
Not 
but 
I 
could 
wish 
there 
were 
a 
perfect 
course 
of 
history 
for 
Graecia, 
from 
Theseus 
to 
Philopoemen 
(what 
time 
the 
affairs 
of 
Graecia 

drowned 
and 
extinguished 
in 
the 
affairs 
of 
Rome), 
and 
for 
Rome 
from 
Romulus 
to 
Justinianus, 
who 
may 
be 
truly 
said 
to 
be 
ultimus 
Romanorum. 
In 
which 
sequences 
of 
story 
the 
text 
of 
Thucydides 
and 
Xenophon 
in 
the 
one, 
and 
the 
texts 
of 
Livius, 
Polybius, 
Sallustius, 
Caesar, 
Appianus, 
Tacitus, 
Herodianus 
in 
the 
other, 
to 
be 
kept 
entire, 
without 
any 
diminution 
at 
all, 
and 
only 
to 
be 
supplied 
and 
continued. 
But 
this 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
magnificence, 
rather 
to 
be 
commended 
than 
required; 
and 
we 
speak 
now 
of 
parts 
of 
learning 
supplemental, 
and 
not 
of 
supererogation. 


(8) 
But 
for 
modern 
histories, 
whereof 
there 
are 
some 
few 
very 
worthy, 
but 
the 
greater 
part 
beneath 
mediocrity, 
leaving 
the 
care 
of 
foreign 
stories 
to 
foreign 
states, 
because 
I 
will 
not 
be 
curiosus 
in 
aliena 
republica, 
I 
cannot 
fail 
to 
represent 
to 
your 
Majesty 
the 
unworthiness 
of 
the 
history 
of 
England 
in 
the 
main 
continuance 
thereof, 
and 
the 
partiality 
and 
obliquity 
of 
that 
of 
Scotland 
in 
the 
latest 
and 
largest 
author 
that 
I 
have 
seen: 
supposing 
that 
it 
would 
be 
honour 
for 
your 
Majesty, 
and 
a 
work 
very 
memorable, 
if 
this 
island 
of 
Great 
Britain, 
as 
it 
is 
now 
joined 
in 
monarchy 
for 
the 
ages 
to 
come, 
so 
were 
joined 
in 
one 
history 
for 
the 
times 
passed, 
after 
the 
manner 
of 
the 
sacred 
history, 
which 
draweth 
down 
the 
story 
of 
the 
ten 
tribes 
and 
of 
the 
two 
tribes 
as 
twins 
together. 
And 
if 
it 
shall 
seem 
that 
the 
greatness 
of 
this 
work 
may 
make 
it 
less 
exactly 
performed, 
there 
is 
an 
excellent 
period 
of 
a 
much 
smaller 
compass 
of 
time, 
as 
to 
the 
story 
of 
England; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
from 
the 
uniting 
of 
the 
Roses 
to 
the 
uniting 
of 
the 
kingdoms; 
a 
portion 
of 
time 
wherein, 
to 
my 
understanding, 
there 
hath 
been 
the 
rarest 
varieties 
that 
in 
like 
number 
of 
successions 
of 
any 
hereditary 
monarchy 
hath 
been 
known. 
For 
it 
beginneth 
with 
the 
mixed 
adoption 
of 
a 
crown 
by 
arms 
and 
title; 
an 
entry 
by 
battle, 
an 
establishment 
by 
marriage; 
and 
therefore 
times 
answerable, 
like 
waters 
after 
a 
tempest, 
full 
of 
working 
and 
swelling, 
though 
without 
extremity 
of 
storm; 
but 
well 
passed 
through 
by 
the 
wisdom 
of 
the 
pilot, 
being 
one 
of 
the 
most 
sufficient 
kings 
of 
all 
the 
number. 
Then 
followeth 
the 
reign 
of 
a 
king, 
whose 
actions, 
howsoever 
conducted, 
had 
much 
intermixture 
with 
the 
affairs 
of 
Europe, 
balancing 
and 
inclining 
them 
variably; 
in 
whose 
time 
also 
began 
that 
great 
alteration 
in 
the 
state 
ecclesiastical, 
an 
action 
which 
seldom 
cometh 
upon 
the 
stage. 
Then 
the 
reign 
of 
a 
minor; 
then 
an 
offer 
of 
a 
usurpation 
(though 
it 
was 
but 
as 
febris 
ephemera). 
Then 
the 
reign 
of 
a 
queen 
matched 
with 
a 
foreigner; 
then 
of 
a 
queen 
that 
lived 
solitary 
and 
unmarried, 
and 
yet 
her 
government 
so 
masculine, 
as 
it 
had 
greater 
impression 
and 
operation 
upon 
the 
states 
abroad 
than 
it 
any 
ways 
received 
from 
thence. 
And 

now 
last, 
this 
most 
happy 
and 
glorious 
event, 
that 
this 
island 
of 
Britain, 
divided 
from 
all 
the 
world, 
should 
be 
united 
in 
itself, 
and 
that 
oracle 
of 
rest 
given 
to 
AENeas, 
antiquam 
exquirite 
matrem, 
should 
now 
be 
performed 
and 
fulfilled 
upon 
the 
nations 
of 
England 
and 
Scotland, 
being 
now 
reunited 
in 
the 
ancient 
mother 
name 
of 
Britain, 
as 
a 
full 
period 
of 
all 
instability 
and 
peregrinations. 
So 
that 
as 
it 
cometh 
to 
pass 
in 
massive 
bodies, 
that 
they 
have 
certain 
trepidations 
and 
waverings 
before 
they 
fix 
and 
settle, 
so 
it 
seemeth 
that 
by 
the 
providence 
of 
God 
this 
monarchy, 
before 
it 
was 
to 
settle 
in 
your 
majesty 
and 
your 
generations 
(in 
which 
I 
hope 
it 
is 
now 
established 
for 
ever), 
it 
had 
these 
prelusive 
changes 
and 
varieties. 


(9) 
For 
lives, 
I 
do 
find 
strange 
that 
these 
times 
have 
so 
little 
esteemed 
the 
virtues 
of 
the 
times, 
as 
that 
the 
writings 
of 
lives 
should 
be 
no 
more 
frequent. 
For 
although 
there 
be 
not 
many 
sovereign 
princes 
or 
absolute 
commanders, 
and 
that 
states 
are 
most 
collected 
into 
monarchies, 
yet 
are 
there 
many 
worthy 
personages 
that 
deserve 
better 
than 
dispersed 
report 
or 
barren 
eulogies. 
For 
herein 
the 
invention 
of 
one 
of 
the 
late 
poets 
is 
proper, 
and 
doth 
well 
enrich 
the 
ancient 
fiction. 
For 
he 
feigneth 
that 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
thread 
or 
web 
of 
every 
man’s 
life 
there 
was 
a 
little 
medal 
containing 
the 
person’s 
name, 
and 
that 
Time 
waited 
upon 
the 
shears, 
and 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
thread 
was 
cut 
caught 
the 
medals, 
and 
carried 
them 
to 
the 
river 
of 
Lathe; 
and 
about 
the 
bank 
there 
were 
many 
birds 
flying 
up 
and 
down, 
that 
would 
get 
the 
medals 
and 
carry 
them 
in 
their 
beak 
a 
little 
while, 
and 
then 
let 
them 
fall 
into 
the 
river. 
Only 
there 
were 
a 
few 
swans, 
which 
if 
they 
got 
a 
name 
would 
carry 
it 
to 
a 
temple 
where 
it 
was 
consecrate. 
And 
although 
many 
men, 
more 
mortal 
in 
their 
affections 
than 
in 
their 
bodies, 
do 
esteem 
desire 
of 
name 
and 
memory 
but 
as 
a 
vanity 
and 
ventosity, 
“Animi 
nil 
magnae 
laudis 
egentes;” 


which 
opinion 
cometh 
from 
that 
root, 
Non 
prius 
laudes 
contempsimus, 
quam 
laudanda 
facere 
desivimus: 
yet 
that 
will 
not 
alter 
Solomon’s 
judgment, 
Memoria 
justi 
cum 
laudibus, 
at 
impiorum 
nomen 
putrescet: 
the 
one 
flourisheth, 
the 
other 
either 
consumeth 
to 
present 
oblivion, 
or 
turneth 
to 
an 
ill 
odour. 
And 
therefore 
in 
that 
style 
or 
addition, 
which 
is 
and 
hath 
been 
long 
well 
received 
and 
brought 
in 
use, 
felicis 
memoriae, 
piae 
memoriae, 
bonae 
memoriae, 
we 
do 
acknowledge 
that 
which 
Cicero 
saith, 
borrowing 
it 
from 
Demosthenes, 
that 
bona 
fama 
propria 
possessio 
defunctorum; 
which 
possession 
I 
cannot 
but 
note 
that 
in 
our 
times 
it 
lieth 



much 
waste, 
and 
that 
therein 
there 
is 
a 
deficience. 


(10) 
For 
narrations 
and 
relations 
of 
particular 
actions, 
there 
were 
also 
to 
be 
wished 
a 
greater 
diligence 
therein; 
for 
there 
is 
no 
great 
action 
but 
hath 
some 
good 
pen 
which 
attends 
it. 
And 
because 
it 
is 
an 
ability 
not 
common 
to 
write 
a 
good 
history, 
as 
may 
well 
appear 
by 
the 
small 
number 
of 
them; 
yet 
if 
particularity 
of 
actions 
memorable 
were 
but 
tolerably 
reported 
as 
they 
pass, 
the 
compiling 
of 
a 
complete 
history 
of 
times 
might 
be 
the 
better 
expected, 
when 
a 
writer 
should 
arise 
that 
were 
fit 
for 
it: 
for 
the 
collection 
of 
such 
relations 
might 
be 
as 
a 
nursery 
garden, 
whereby 
to 
plant 
a 
fair 
and 
stately 
garden 
when 
time 
should 
serve. 
(11) 
There 
is 
yet 
another 
partition 
of 
history 
which 
Cornelius 
Tacitus 
maketh, 
which 
is 
not 
to 
be 
forgotten, 
specially 
with 
that 
application 
which 
he 
accoupleth 
it 
withal, 
annals 
and 
journals: 
appropriating 
to 
the 
former 
matters 
of 
estate, 
and 
to 
the 
latter 
acts 
and 
accidents 
of 
a 
meaner 
nature. 
For 
giving 
but 
a 
touch 
of 
certain 
magnificent 
buildings, 
he 
addeth, 
Cum 
ex 
dignitate 
populi 
Romani 
repertum 
sit, 
res 
illustres 
annalibus, 
talia 
diurnis 
urbis 
actis 
mandare. 
So 
as 
there 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
contemplative 
heraldry, 
as 
well 
as 
civil. 
And 
as 
nothing 
doth 
derogate 
from 
the 
dignity 
of 
a 
state 
more 
than 
confusion 
of 
degrees, 
so 
it 
doth 
not 
a 
little 
imbase 
the 
authority 
of 
a 
history 
to 
intermingle 
matters 
of 
triumph, 
or 
matters 
of 
ceremony, 
or 
matters 
of 
novelty, 
with 
matters 
of 
state. 
But 
the 
use 
of 
a 
journal 
hath 
not 
only 
been 
in 
the 
history 
of 
time, 
but 
likewise 
in 
the 
history 
of 
persons, 
and 
chiefly 
of 
actions; 
for 
princes 
in 
ancient 
time 
had, 
upon 
point 
of 
honour 
and 
policy 
both, 
journals 
kept, 
what 
passed 
day 
by 
day. 
For 
we 
see 
the 
chronicle 
which 
was 
read 
before 
Ahasuerus, 
when 
he 
could 
not 
take 
rest, 
contained 
matter 
of 
affairs, 
indeed, 
but 
such 
as 
had 
passed 
in 
his 
own 
time 
and 
very 
lately 
before. 
But 
the 
journal 
of 
Alexander’s 
house 
expressed 
every 
small 
particularity, 
even 
concerning 
his 
person 
and 
court; 
and 
it 
is 
yet 
a 
use 
well 
received 
in 
enterprises 
memorable, 
as 
expeditions 
of 
war, 
navigations, 
and 
the 
like, 
to 
keep 
diaries 
of 
that 
which 
passeth 
continually. 
(12) 
I 
cannot 
likewise 
be 
ignorant 
of 
a 
form 
of 
writing 
which 
some 
grave 
and 
wise 
men 
have 
used, 
containing 
a 
scattered 
history 
of 
those 
actions 
which 
they 
have 
thought 
worthy 
of 
memory, 
with 
politic 
discourse 
and 
observation 
thereupon: 
not 
incorporate 
into 
the 
history, 
but 
separately, 
and 
as 
the 
more 
principal 
in 
their 
intention; 
which 
kind 
of 
ruminated 
history 
I 
think 
more 
fit 
to 
place 
amongst 
books 
of 
policy, 
whereof 
we 
shall 
hereafter 
speak, 

than 
amongst 
books 
of 
history. 
For 
it 
is 
the 
true 
office 
of 
history 
to 
represent 
the 
events 
themselves 
together 
with 
the 
counsels, 
and 
to 
leave 
the 
observations 
and 
conclusions 
thereupon 
to 
the 
liberty 
and 
faculty 
of 
every 
man’s 
judgment. 
But 
mixtures 
are 
things 
irregular, 
whereof 
no 
man 
can 
define. 


(13) 
So 
also 
is 
there 
another 
kind 
of 
history 
manifoldly 
mixed, 
and 
that 
is 
history 
of 
cosmography: 
being 
compounded 
of 
natural 
history, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
regions 
themselves; 
of 
history 
civil, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
habitations, 
regiments, 
and 
manners 
of 
the 
people; 
and 
the 
mathematics, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
climates 
and 
configurations 
towards 
the 
heavens: 
which 
part 
of 
learning 
of 
all 
others 
in 
this 
latter 
time 
hath 
obtained 
most 
proficience. 
For 
it 
may 
be 
truly 
affirmed 
to 
the 
honour 
of 
these 
times, 
and 
in 
a 
virtuous 
emulation 
with 
antiquity, 
that 
this 
great 
building 
of 
the 
world 
had 
never 
through-lights 
made 
in 
it, 
till 
the 
age 
of 
us 
and 
our 
fathers. 
For 
although 
they 
had 
knowledge 
of 
the 
antipodes, 
“Nosque 
ubi 
primus 
equis 
Oriens 
afflavit 
anhelis, 
Illic 
sera 
rubens 
accendit 
lumina 
Vesper,” 


yet 
that 
might 
be 
by 
demonstration, 
and 
not 
in 
fact; 
and 
if 
by 
travel, 
it 
requireth 
the 
voyage 
but 
of 
half 
the 
globe. 
But 
to 
circle 
the 
earth, 
as 
the 
heavenly 
bodies 
do, 
was 
not 
done 
nor 
enterprised 
till 
these 
later 
times: 
and 
therefore 
these 
times 
may 
justly 
bear 
in 
their 
word, 
not 
only 
plus 
ultra, 
in 
precedence 
of 
the 
ancient 
non 
ultra, 
and 
imitabile 
fulmen, 
in 
precedence 
of 
the 
ancient 
non 
imitabile 
fulmen, 


“Demens 
qui 
nimbos 
et 
non 
imitabile 
fulmen,” 
&c. 


but 
likewise 
imitabile 
caelum; 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
many 
memorable 
voyages 
after 
the 
manner 
of 
heaven 
about 
the 
globe 
of 
the 
earth. 


(14) 
And 
this 
proficience 
in 
navigation 
and 
discoveries 
may 
plant 
also 
an 
expectation 
of 
the 
further 
proficience 
and 
augmentation 
of 
all 
sciences; 
because 
it 
may 
seem 
they 
are 
ordained 
by 
God 
to 
be 
coevals, 
that 
is, 
to 
meet 
in 
one 
age. 
For 
so 
the 
prophet 
Daniel 
speaking 
of 
the 
latter 
times 
foretelleth, 
Plurimi 
pertransibunt, 
et 
multiplex 
erit 
scientia: 
as 
if 
the 
openness 
and 
through-passage 
of 
the 
world 
and 
the 
increase 
of 
knowledge 
were 
appointed 
to 
be 
in 
the 
same 
ages; 
as 
we 
see 
it 
is 
already 
performed 
in 
great 
part: 
the 
learning 
of 
these 
later 
times 
not 
much 
giving 
place 
to 
the 
former 
two 

periods 
or 
returns 
of 
learning, 
the 
one 
of 
the 
Grecians, 
the 
other 
of 
the 
Romans. 



III 


(1) 
History 
ecclesiastical 
receiveth 
the 
same 
divisions 
with 
history 
civil: 
but 
further 
in 
the 
propriety 
thereof 
may 
be 
divided 
into 
the 
history 
of 
the 
Church, 
by 
a 
general 
name; 
history 
of 
prophecy; 
and 
history 
of 
providence. 
The 
first 
describeth 
the 
times 
of 
the 
militant 
Church, 
whether 
it 
be 
fluctuant, 
as 
the 
ark 
of 
Noah, 
or 
movable, 
as 
the 
ark 
in 
the 
wilderness, 
or 
at 
rest, 
as 
the 
ark 
in 
the 
Temple: 
that 
is, 
the 
state 
of 
the 
Church 
in 
persecution, 
in 
remove, 
and 
in 
peace. 
This 
part 
I 
ought 
in 
no 
sort 
to 
note 
as 
deficient; 
only 
I 
would 
that 
the 
virtue 
and 
sincerity 
of 
it 
were 
according 
to 
the 
mass 
and 
quantity. 
But 
I 
am 
not 
now 
in 
hand 
with 
censures, 
but 
with 
omissions. 
(2) 
The 
second, 
which 
is 
history 
of 
prophecy, 
consisteth 
of 
two 
relatives 
— 
the 
prophecy 
and 
the 
accomplishment; 
and, 
therefore, 
the 
nature 
of 
such 
a 
work 
ought 
to 
be, 
that 
every 
prophecy 
of 
the 
Scripture 
be 
sorted 
with 
the 
event 
fulfilling 
the 
same 
throughout 
the 
ages 
of 
the 
world, 
both 
for 
the 
better 
confirmation 
of 
faith 
and 
for 
the 
better 
illumination 
of 
the 
Church 
touching 
those 
parts 
of 
prophecies 
which 
are 
yet 
unfulfilled: 
allowing, 
nevertheless, 
that 
latitude 
which 
is 
agreeable 
and 
familiar 
unto 
divine 
prophecies, 
being 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
their 
Author, 
with 
whom 
a 
thousand 
years 
are 
but 
as 
one 
day, 
and 
therefore 
are 
not 
fulfilled 
punctually 
at 
once, 
but 
have 
springing 
and 
germinant 
accomplishment 
throughout 
many 
ages, 
though 
the 
height 
or 
fulness 
of 
them 
may 
refer 
to 
some 
one 
age. 
This 
is 
a 
work 
which 
I 
find 
deficient, 
but 
is 
to 
be 
done 
with 
wisdom, 
sobriety, 
and 
reverence, 
or 
not 
at 
all. 
(3) 
The 
third, 
which 
is 
history 
of 
Providence, 
containeth 
that 
excellent 
correspondence 
which 
is 
between 
God’s 
revealed 
will 
and 
His 
secret 
will; 
which 
though 
it 
be 
so 
obscure, 
as 
for 
the 
most 
part 
it 
is 
not 
legible 
to 
the 
natural 
man 
— 
no, 
nor 
many 
times 
to 
those 
that 
behold 
it 
from 
the 
tabernacle 
— 
yet, 
at 
some 
times 
it 
pleaseth 
God, 
for 
our 
better 
establishment 
and 
the 
confuting 
of 
those 
which 
are 
as 
without 
God 
in 
the 
world, 
to 
write 
it 
in 
such 
text 
and 
capital 
letters, 
that, 
as 
the 
prophet 
saith, 
“He 
that 
runneth 
by 
may 
read 
it”— 
that 
is, 
mere 
sensual 
persons, 
which 
hasten 
by 
God’s 
judgments, 
and 
never 
bend 
or 
fix 
their 
cogitations 
upon 
them, 
are 

nevertheless 
in 
their 
passage 
and 
race 
urged 
to 
discern 
it. 
Such 
are 
the 
notable 
events 
and 
examples 
of 
God’s 
judgments, 
chastisements, 
deliverances, 
and 
blessings; 
and 
this 
is 
a 
work 
which 
has 
passed 
through 
the 
labour 
of 
many, 
and 
therefore 
I 
cannot 
present 
as 
omitted. 


(4) 
There 
are 
also 
other 
parts 
of 
learning 
which 
are 
appendices 
to 
history. 
For 
all 
the 
exterior 
proceedings 
of 
man 
consist 
of 
words 
and 
deeds, 
whereof 
history 
doth 
properly 
receive 
and 
retain 
in 
memory 
the 
deeds; 
and 
if 
words, 
yet 
but 
as 
inducements 
and 
passages 
to 
deeds; 
so 
are 
there 
other 
books 
and 
writings 
which 
are 
appropriate 
to 
the 
custody 
and 
receipt 
of 
words 
only, 
which 
likewise 
are 
of 
three 
sorts 
— 
orations, 
letters, 
and 
brief 
speeches 
or 
sayings. 
Orations 
are 
pleadings, 
speeches 
of 
counsel, 
laudatives, 
invectives, 
apologies, 
reprehensions, 
orations 
of 
formality 
or 
ceremony, 
and 
the 
like. 
Letters 
are 
according 
to 
all 
the 
variety 
of 
occasions, 
advertisements, 
advises, 
directions, 
propositions, 
petitions, 
commendatory, 
expostulatory, 
satisfactory, 
of 
compliment, 
of 
pleasure, 
of 
discourse, 
and 
all 
other 
passages 
of 
action. 
And 
such 
as 
are 
written 
from 
wise 
men, 
are 
of 
all 
the 
words 
of 
man, 
in 
my 
judgment, 
the 
best; 
for 
they 
are 
more 
natural 
than 
orations 
and 
public 
speeches, 
and 
more 
advised 
than 
conferences 
or 
present 
speeches. 
So 
again 
letters 
of 
affairs 
from 
such 
as 
manage 
them, 
or 
are 
privy 
to 
them, 
are 
of 
all 
others 
the 
best 
instructions 
for 
history, 
and 
to 
a 
diligent 
reader 
the 
best 
histories 
in 
themselves. 
For 
apophthegms, 
it 
is 
a 
great 
loss 
of 
that 
book 
of 
Caesar’s; 
for 
as 
his 
history, 
and 
those 
few 
letters 
of 
his 
which 
we 
have, 
and 
those 
apophthegms 
which 
were 
of 
his 
own, 
excel 
all 
men’s 
else, 
so 
I 
suppose 
would 
his 
collection 
of 
apophthegms 
have 
done; 
for 
as 
for 
those 
which 
are 
collected 
by 
others, 
either 
I 
have 
no 
taste 
in 
such 
matters 
or 
else 
their 
choice 
hath 
not 
been 
happy. 
But 
upon 
these 
three 
kinds 
of 
writings 
I 
do 
not 
insist, 
because 
I 
have 
no 
deficiences 
to 
propound 
concerning 
them. 
(5) 
Thus 
much 
therefore 
concerning 
history, 
which 
is 
that 
part 
of 
learning 
which 
answereth 
to 
one 
of 
the 
cells, 
domiciles, 
or 
offices 
of 
the 
mind 
of 
man, 
which 
is 
that 
of 
the 
memory. 

IV 


(1) 
Poesy 
is 
a 
part 
of 
learning 
in 
measure 
of 
words, 
for 
the 
most 
part 
restrained, 
but 
in 
all 
other 
points 
extremely 
licensed, 
and 
doth 
truly 
refer 
to 
the 
imagination; 
which, 
being 
not 
tied 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
matter, 
may 
at 
pleasure 
join 
that 
which 
nature 
hath 
severed, 
and 
sever 
that 
which 
nature 
hath 
joined, 
and 
so 
make 
unlawful 
matches 
and 
divorces 
of 
things 
— 
Pictoribus 
atque 
poetis, 
&c. 
It 
is 
taken 
in 
two 
senses 
in 
respect 
of 
words 
or 
matter. 
In 
the 
first 
sense, 
it 
is 
but 
a 
character 
of 
style, 
and 
belongeth 
to 
arts 
of 
speech, 
and 
is 
not 
pertinent 
for 
the 
present. 
In 
the 
latter, 
it 
is 
— 
as 
hath 
been 
said 
— 
one 
of 
the 
principal 
portions 
of 
learning, 
and 
is 
nothing 
else 
but 
feigned 
history, 
which 
may 
be 
styled 
as 
well 
in 
prose 
as 
in 
verse. 
(2) 
The 
use 
of 
this 
feigned 
history 
hath 
been 
to 
give 
some 
shadow 
of 
satisfaction 
to 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
in 
those 
points 
wherein 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
doth 
deny 
it, 
the 
world 
being 
in 
proportion 
inferior 
to 
the 
soul; 
by 
reason 
whereof 
there 
is, 
agreeable 
to 
the 
spirit 
of 
man, 
a 
more 
ample 
greatness, 
a 
more 
exact 
goodness, 
and 
a 
more 
absolute 
variety, 
than 
can 
be 
found 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
things. 
Therefore, 
because 
the 
acts 
or 
events 
of 
true 
history 
have 
not 
that 
magnitude 
which 
satisfieth 
the 
mind 
of 
man, 
poesy 
feigneth 
acts 
and 
events 
greater 
and 
more 
heroical. 
Because 
true 
history 
propoundeth 
the 
successes 
and 
issues 
of 
actions 
not 
so 
agreeable 
to 
the 
merits 
of 
virtue 
and 
vice, 
therefore 
poesy 
feigns 
them 
more 
just 
in 
retribution, 
and 
more 
according 
to 
revealed 
Providence. 
Because 
true 
history 
representeth 
actions 
and 
events 
more 
ordinary 
and 
less 
interchanged, 
therefore 
poesy 
endueth 
them 
with 
more 
rareness 
and 
more 
unexpected 
and 
alternative 
variations. 
So 
as 
it 
appeareth 
that 
poesy 
serveth 
and 
conferreth 
to 
magnanimity, 
morality 
and 
to 
delectation. 
And 
therefore, 
it 
was 
ever 
thought 
to 
have 
some 
participation 
of 
divineness, 
because 
it 
doth 
raise 
and 
erect 
the 
mind, 
by 
submitting 
the 
shows 
of 
things 
to 
the 
desires 
of 
the 
mind; 
whereas 
reason 
doth 
buckle 
and 
bow 
the 
mind 
unto 
the 
nature 
of 
things. 
And 
we 
see 
that 
by 
these 
insinuations 
and 
congruities 
with 
man’s 
nature 
and 
pleasure, 
joined 
also 
with 
the 
agreement 
and 
consort 
it 
hath 
with 
music, 
it 
hath 
had 
access 
and 
estimation 
in 
rude 
times 
and 
barbarous 
regions, 
where 
other 
learning 
stood 
excluded. 

(3) 
The 
division 
of 
poesy 
which 
is 
aptest 
in 
the 
propriety 
thereof 
(besides 
those 
divisions 
which 
are 
common 
unto 
it 
with 
history, 
as 
feigned 
chronicles, 
feigned 
lives, 
and 
the 
appendices 
of 
history, 
as 
feigned 
epistles, 
feigned 
orations, 
and 
the 
rest) 
is 
into 
poesy 
narrative, 
representative, 
and 
allusive. 
The 
narrative 
is 
a 
mere 
imitation 
of 
history, 
with 
the 
excesses 
before 
remembered, 
choosing 
for 
subjects 
commonly 
wars 
and 
love, 
rarely 
state, 
and 
sometimes 
pleasure 
or 
mirth. 
Representative 
is 
as 
a 
visible 
history, 
and 
is 
an 
image 
of 
actions 
as 
if 
they 
were 
present, 
as 
history 
is 
of 
actions 
in 
nature 
as 
they 
are 
(that 
is) 
past. 
Allusive, 
or 
parabolical, 
is 
a 
narration 
applied 
only 
to 
express 
some 
special 
purpose 
or 
conceit; 
which 
latter 
kind 
of 
parabolical 
wisdom 
was 
much 
more 
in 
use 
in 
the 
ancient 
times, 
as 
by 
the 
fables 
of 
AEsop, 
and 
the 
brief 
sentences 
of 
the 
seven, 
and 
the 
use 
of 
hieroglyphics 
may 
appear. 
And 
the 
cause 
was 
(for 
that 
it 
was 
then 
of 
necessity 
to 
express 
any 
point 
of 
reason 
which 
was 
more 
sharp 
or 
subtle 
than 
the 
vulgar 
in 
that 
manner) 
because 
men 
in 
those 
times 
wanted 
both 
variety 
of 
examples 
and 
subtlety 
of 
conceit. 
And 
as 
hieroglyphics 
were 
before 
letters, 
so 
parables 
were 
before 
arguments; 
and 
nevertheless 
now 
and 
at 
all 
times 
they 
do 
retain 
much 
life 
and 
rigour, 
because 
reason 
cannot 
be 
so 
sensible 
nor 
examples 
so 
fit. 
(4) 
But 
there 
remaineth 
yet 
another 
use 
of 
poesy 
parabolical, 
opposite 
to 
that 
which 
we 
last 
mentioned; 
for 
that 
tendeth 
to 
demonstrate 
and 
illustrate 
that 
which 
is 
taught 
or 
delivered, 
and 
this 
other 
to 
retire 
and 
obscure 
it 
— 
that 
is, 
when 
the 
secrets 
and 
mysteries 
of 
religion, 
policy, 
or 
philosophy, 
are 
involved 
in 
fables 
or 
parables. 
Of 
this 
in 
divine 
poesy 
we 
see 
the 
use 
is 
authorised. 
In 
heathen 
poesy 
we 
see 
the 
exposition 
of 
fables 
doth 
fall 
out 
sometimes 
with 
great 
felicity: 
as 
in 
the 
fable 
that 
the 
giants 
being 
overthrown 
in 
their 
war 
against 
the 
gods, 
the 
earth 
their 
mother 
in 
revenge 
thereof 
brought 
forth 
Fame:— 
“Illam 
terra 
parens, 
ira 
irritat 
Deorum, 
Extremam, 
ut 
perhibent, 
Coeo 
Enceladoque 
soroem, 
Progenuit.” 


Expounded 
that 
when 
princes 
and 
monarchs 
have 
suppressed 
actual 
and 
open 
rebels, 
then 
the 
malignity 
of 
people 
(which 
is 
the 
mother 
of 
rebellion) 
doth 
bring 
forth 
libels 
and 
slanders, 
and 
taxations 
of 
the 
states, 
which 
is 
of 
the 
same 
kind 
with 
rebellion 
but 
more 
feminine. 
So 
in 
the 
fable 
that 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
gods 
having 
conspired 
to 
bind 
Jupiter, 
Pallas 
called 
Briareus 
with 
his 
hundred 
hands 
to 
his 
aid: 
expounded 
that 
monarchies 
need 



not 
fear 
any 
curbing 
of 
their 
absoluteness 
by 
mighty 
subjects, 
as 
long 
as 
by 
wisdom 
they 
keep 
the 
hearts 
of 
the 
people, 
who 
will 
be 
sure 
to 
come 
in 
on 
their 
side. 
So 
in 
the 
fable 
that 
Achilles 
was 
brought 
up 
under 
Chiron, 
the 
centaur, 
who 
was 
part 
a 
man 
and 
part 
a 
beast, 
expounded 
ingeniously 
but 
corruptly 
by 
Machiavel, 
that 
it 
belongeth 
to 
the 
education 
and 
discipline 
of 
princes 
to 
know 
as 
well 
how 
to 
play 
the 
part 
of 
a 
lion 
in 
violence, 
and 
the 
fox 
in 
guile, 
as 
of 
the 
man 
in 
virtue 
and 
justice. 
Nevertheless, 
in 
many 
the 
like 
encounters, 
I 
do 
rather 
think 
that 
the 
fable 
was 
first, 
and 
the 
exposition 
devised, 
than 
that 
the 
moral 
was 
first, 
and 
thereupon 
the 
fable 
framed; 
for 
I 
find 
it 
was 
an 
ancient 
vanity 
in 
Chrysippus, 
that 
troubled 
himself 
with 
great 
contention 
to 
fasten 
the 
assertions 
of 
the 
Stoics 
upon 
the 
fictions 
of 
the 
ancient 
poets; 
but 
yet 
that 
all 
the 
fables 
and 
fictions 
of 
the 
poets 
were 
but 
pleasure 
and 
not 
figure, 
I 
interpose 
no 
opinion. 
Surely 
of 
these 
poets 
which 
are 
now 
extant, 
even 
Homer 
himself 
(notwithstanding 
he 
was 
made 
a 
kind 
of 
scripture 
by 
the 
later 
schools 
of 
the 
Grecians), 
yet 
I 
should 
without 
any 
difficulty 
pronounce 
that 
his 
fables 
had 
no 
such 
inwardness 
in 
his 
own 
meaning. 
But 
what 
they 
might 
have 
upon 
a 
more 
original 
tradition 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
affirm, 
for 
he 
was 
not 
the 
inventor 
of 
many 
of 
them. 


(5) 
In 
this 
third 
part 
of 
learning, 
which 
is 
poesy, 
I 
can 
report 
no 
deficience; 
for 
being 
as 
a 
plant 
that 
cometh 
of 
the 
lust 
of 
the 
earth, 
without 
a 
formal 
seed, 
it 
hath 
sprung 
up 
and 
spread 
abroad 
more 
than 
any 
other 
kind. 
But 
to 
ascribe 
unto 
it 
that 
which 
is 
due, 
for 
the 
expressing 
of 
affections, 
passions, 
corruptions, 
and 
customs, 
we 
are 
beholding 
to 
poets 
more 
than 
to 
the 
philosophers’ 
works; 
and 
for 
wit 
and 
eloquence, 
not 
much 
less 
than 
to 
orators’ 
harangues. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
good 
to 
stay 
too 
long 
in 
the 
theatre. 
Let 
us 
now 
pass 
on 
to 
the 
judicial 
place 
or 
palace 
of 
the 
mind, 
which 
we 
are 
to 
approach 
and 
view 
with 
more 
reverence 
and 
attention. 

V 


(1) 
The 
knowledge 
of 
man 
is 
as 
the 
waters, 
some 
descending 
from 
above, 
and 
some 
springing 
from 
beneath: 
the 
one 
informed 
by 
the 
light 
of 
nature, 
the 
other 
inspired 
by 
divine 
revelation. 
The 
light 
of 
nature 
consisteth 
in 
the 
notions 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
the 
reports 
of 
the 
senses; 
for 
as 
for 
knowledge 
which 
man 
receiveth 
by 
teaching, 
it 
is 
cumulative 
and 
not 
original, 
as 
in 
a 
water 
that 
besides 
his 
own 
spring-head 
is 
fed 
with 
other 
springs 
and 
streams. 
So 
then, 
according 
to 
these 
two 
differing 
illuminations 
or 
originals, 
knowledge 
is 
first 
of 
all 
divided 
into 
divinity 
and 
philosophy. 
(2) 
In 
philosophy 
the 
contemplations 
of 
man 
do 
either 
penetrate 
unto 
God, 
or 
are 
circumferred 
to 
nature, 
or 
are 
reflected 
or 
reverted 
upon 
himself. 
Out 
of 
which 
several 
inquiries 
there 
do 
arise 
three 
knowledges 
— 
divine 
philosophy, 
natural 
philosophy, 
and 
human 
philosophy 
or 
humanity. 
For 
all 
things 
are 
marked 
and 
stamped 
with 
this 
triple 
character 
— 
the 
power 
of 
God, 
the 
difference 
of 
nature 
and 
the 
use 
of 
man. 
But 
because 
the 
distributions 
and 
partitions 
of 
knowledge 
are 
not 
like 
several 
lines 
that 
meet 
in 
one 
angle, 
and 
so 
touch 
but 
in 
a 
point, 
but 
are 
like 
branches 
of 
a 
tree 
that 
meet 
in 
a 
stem, 
which 
hath 
a 
dimension 
and 
quantity 
of 
entireness 
and 
continuance 
before 
it 
come 
to 
discontinue 
and 
break 
itself 
into 
arms 
and 
boughs; 
therefore 
it 
is 
good, 
before 
we 
enter 
into 
the 
former 
distribution, 
to 
erect 
and 
constitute 
one 
universal 
science, 
by 
the 
name 
of 
philosophia 
prima, 
primitive 
or 
summary 
philosophy, 
as 
the 
main 
and 
common 
way, 
before 
we 
come 
where 
the 
ways 
part 
and 
divide 
themselves; 
which 
science 
whether 
I 
should 
report 
as 
deficient 
or 
no, 
I 
stand 
doubtful. 
For 
I 
find 
a 
certain 
rhapsody 
of 
natural 
theology, 
and 
of 
divers 
parts 
of 
logic; 
and 
of 
that 
part 
of 
natural 
philosophy 
which 
concerneth 
the 
principles, 
and 
of 
that 
other 
part 
of 
natural 
philosophy 
which 
concerneth 
the 
soul 
or 
spirit 
— 
all 
these 
strangely 
commixed 
and 
confused; 
but 
being 
examined, 
it 
seemeth 
to 
me 
rather 
a 
depredation 
of 
other 
sciences, 
advanced 
and 
exalted 
unto 
some 
height 
of 
terms, 
than 
anything 
solid 
or 
substantive 
of 
itself. 
Nevertheless 
I 
cannot 
be 
ignorant 
of 
the 
distinction 
which 
is 
current, 
that 
the 
same 
things 
are 
handled 
but 
in 
several 
respects. 
As 
for 
example, 
that 
logic 
considereth 
of 
many 
things 
as 
they 
are 
in 
notion, 
and 
this 
philosophy 
as 
they 
are 
in 
nature 
— 
the 
one 
in 

appearance, 
the 
other 
in 
existence; 
but 
I 
find 
this 
difference 
better 
made 
than 
pursued. 
For 
if 
they 
had 
considered 
quantity, 
similitude, 
diversity, 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
those 
extern 
characters 
of 
things, 
as 
philosophers, 
and 
in 
nature, 
their 
inquiries 
must 
of 
force 
have 
been 
of 
a 
far 
other 
kind 
than 
they 
are. 
For 
doth 
any 
of 
them, 
in 
handling 
quantity, 
speak 
of 
the 
force 
of 
union, 
how 
and 
how 
far 
it 
multiplieth 
virtue? 
Doth 
any 
give 
the 
reason 
why 
some 
things 
in 
nature 
are 
so 
common, 
and 
in 
so 
great 
mass, 
and 
others 
so 
rare, 
and 
in 
so 
small 
quantity? 
Doth 
any, 
in 
handling 
similitude 
and 
diversity, 
assign 
the 
cause 
why 
iron 
should 
not 
move 
to 
iron, 
which 
is 
more 
like, 
but 
move 
to 
the 
loadstone, 
which 
is 
less 
like? 
Why 
in 
all 
diversities 
of 
things 
there 
should 
be 
certain 
participles 
in 
nature 
which 
are 
almost 
ambiguous 
to 
which 
kind 
they 
should 
be 
referred? 
But 
there 
is 
a 
mere 
and 
deep 
silence 
touching 
the 
nature 
and 
operation 
of 
those 
common 
adjuncts 
of 
things, 
as 
in 
nature; 
and 
only 
a 
resuming 
and 
repeating 
of 
the 
force 
and 
use 
of 
them 
in 
speech 
or 
argument. 
Therefore, 
because 
in 
a 
writing 
of 
this 
nature 
I 
avoid 
all 
subtlety, 
my 
meaning 
touching 
this 
original 
or 
universal 
philosophy 
is 
thus, 
in 
a 
plain 
and 
gross 
description 
by 
negative: 
“That 
it 
be 
a 
receptacle 
for 
all 
such 
profitable 
observations 
and 
axioms 
as 
fall 
not 
within 
the 
compass 
of 
any 
of 
the 
special 
parts 
of 
philosophy 
or 
sciences, 
but 
are 
more 
common 
and 
of 
a 
higher 
stage.” 


(3) 
Now 
that 
there 
are 
many 
of 
that 
kind 
need 
not 
be 
doubted. 
For 
example: 
Is 
not 
the 
rule, 
Si 
inoequalibus 
aequalia 
addas, 
omnia 
erunt 
inaequalia, 
an 
axiom 
as 
well 
of 
justice 
as 
of 
the 
mathematics? 
and 
is 
there 
not 
a 
true 
coincidence 
between 
commutative 
and 
distributive 
justice, 
and 
arithmetical 
and 
geometrical 
proportion? 
Is 
not 
that 
other 
rule, 
Quae 
in 
eodem 
tertio 
conveniunt, 
et 
inter 
se 
conveniunt, 
a 
rule 
taken 
from 
the 
mathematics, 
but 
so 
potent 
in 
logic 
as 
all 
syllogisms 
are 
built 
upon 
it? 
Is 
not 
the 
observation, 
Omnia 
mutantur, 
nil 
interit, 
a 
contemplation 
in 
philosophy 
thus, 
that 
the 
quantum 
of 
nature 
is 
eternal? 
in 
natural 
theology 
thus, 
that 
it 
requireth 
the 
same 
omnipotency 
to 
make 
somewhat 
nothing, 
which 
at 
the 
first 
made 
nothing 
somewhat? 
according 
to 
the 
Scripture, 
Didici 
quod 
omnia 
opera, 
quoe 
fecit 
Deus, 
perseverent 
in 
perpetuum; 
non 
possumus 
eis 
quicquam 
addere 
nec 
auferre. 
Is 
not 
the 
ground, 
which 
Machiavel 
wisely 
and 
largely 
discourseth 
concerning 
governments, 
that 
the 
way 
to 
establish 
and 
preserve 
them 
is 
to 
reduce 
them 
ad 
principia 
— 
a 
rule 
in 
religion 
and 
nature, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
civil 
administration? 
Was 
not 
the 
Persian 
magic 
a 
reduction 
or 
correspondence 
of 
the 
principles 
and 
architectures 
of 
nature 
to 
the 
rules 
and 
policy 
of 
governments? 
Is 
not 
the 
precept 
of 
a 
musician, 
to 
fall 
from 
a 
discord 

or 
harsh 
accord 
upon 
a 
concord 
or 
sweet 
accord, 
alike 
true 
in 
affection? 
Is 
not 
the 
trope 
of 
music, 
to 
avoid 
or 
slide 
from 
the 
close 
or 
cadence, 
common 
with 
the 
trope 
of 
rhetoric 
of 
deceiving 
expectation? 
Is 
not 
the 
delight 
of 
the 
quavering 
upon 
a 
stop 
in 
music 
the 
same 
with 
the 
playing 
of 
light 
upon 
the 
water? 


“Splendet 
tremulo 
sub 
lumine 
pontus.” 


Are 
not 
the 
organs 
of 
the 
senses 
of 
one 
kind 
with 
the 
organs 
of 
reflection, 
the 
eye 
with 
a 
glass, 
the 
ear 
with 
a 
cave 
or 
strait, 
determined 
and 
bounded? 
Neither 
are 
these 
only 
similitudes, 
as 
men 
of 
narrow 
observation 
may 
conceive 
them 
to 
be, 
but 
the 
same 
footsteps 
of 
nature, 
treading 
or 
printing 
upon 
several 
subjects 
or 
matters. 
This 
science 
therefore 
(as 
I 
understand 
it) 
I 
may 
justly 
report 
as 
deficient; 
for 
I 
see 
sometimes 
the 
profounder 
sort 
of 
wits, 
in 
handling 
some 
particular 
argument, 
will 
now 
and 
then 
draw 
a 
bucket 
of 
water 
out 
of 
this 
well 
for 
their 
present 
use; 
but 
the 
spring-head 
thereof 
seemeth 
to 
me 
not 
to 
have 
been 
visited, 
being 
of 
so 
excellent 
use 
both 
for 
the 
disclosing 
of 
nature 
and 
the 
abridgment 
of 
art. 



VI 


(1) 
This 
science 
being 
therefore 
first 
placed 
as 
a 
common 
parent 
like 
unto 
Berecynthia, 
which 
had 
so 
much 
heavenly 
issue, 
omnes 
coelicolas, 
omnes 
supera 
alta 
tenetes; 
we 
may 
return 
to 
the 
former 
distribution 
of 
the 
three 
philosophies 
— 
divine, 
natural, 
and 
human. 
And 
as 
concerning 
divine 
philosophy 
or 
natural 
theology, 
it 
is 
that 
knowledge 
or 
rudiment 
of 
knowledge 
concerning 
God 
which 
may 
be 
obtained 
by 
the 
contemplation 
of 
His 
creatures; 
which 
knowledge 
may 
be 
truly 
termed 
divine 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
object, 
and 
natural 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
light. 
The 
bounds 
of 
this 
knowledge 
are, 
that 
it 
sufficeth 
to 
convince 
atheism, 
but 
not 
to 
inform 
religion; 
and 
therefore 
there 
was 
never 
miracle 
wrought 
by 
God 
to 
convert 
an 
atheist, 
because 
the 
light 
of 
nature 
might 
have 
led 
him 
to 
confess 
a 
God; 
but 
miracles 
have 
been 
wrought 
to 
convert 
idolaters 
and 
the 
superstitious, 
because 
no 
light 
of 
nature 
extendeth 
to 
declare 
the 
will 
and 
true 
worship 
of 
God. 
For 
as 
all 
works 
do 
show 
forth 
the 
power 
and 
skill 
of 
the 
workman, 
and 
not 
his 
image, 
so 
it 
is 
of 
the 
works 
of 
God, 
which 
do 
show 
the 
omnipotency 
and 
wisdom 
of 
the 
Maker, 
but 
not 
His 
image. 
And 
therefore 
therein 
the 
heathen 
opinion 
differeth 
from 
the 
sacred 
truth: 
for 
they 
supposed 
the 
world 
to 
be 
the 
image 
of 
God, 
and 
man 
to 
be 
an 
extract 
or 
compendious 
image 
of 
the 
world; 
but 
the 
Scriptures 
never 
vouchsafe 
to 
attribute 
to 
the 
world 
that 
honour, 
as 
to 
be 
the 
image 
of 
God, 
but 
only 
THE 
WORK 
OF 
HIS 
HANDS; 
neither 
do 
they 
speak 
of 
any 
other 
image 
of 
God 
but 
man. 
Wherefore 
by 
the 
contemplation 
of 
nature 
to 
induce 
and 
enforce 
the 
acknowledgment 
of 
God, 
and 
to 
demonstrate 
His 
power, 
providence, 
and 
goodness, 
is 
an 
excellent 
argument, 
and 
hath 
been 
excellently 
handled 
by 
divers, 
but 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
out 
of 
the 
contemplation 
of 
nature, 
or 
ground 
of 
human 
knowledges, 
to 
induce 
any 
verity 
or 
persuasion 
concerning 
the 
points 
of 
faith, 
is 
in 
my 
judgment 
not 
safe; 
Da 
fidei 
quae 
fidei 
sunt. 
For 
the 
heathen 
themselves 
conclude 
as 
much 
in 
that 
excellent 
and 
divine 
fable 
of 
the 
golden 
chain, 
“That 
men 
and 
gods 
were 
not 
able 
to 
draw 
Jupiter 
down 
to 
the 
earth; 
but, 
contrariwise, 
Jupiter 
was 
able 
to 
draw 
them 
up 
to 
heaven.” 
So 
as 
we 
ought 
not 
to 
attempt 
to 
draw 
down 
or 
submit 
the 
mysteries 
of 
God 
to 
our 
reason, 
but 
contrariwise 
to 
raise 
and 
advance 
our 
reason 
to 
the 
divine 
truth. 
So 
as 
in 
this 
part 
of 
knowledge, 

touching 
divine 
philosophy, 
I 
am 
so 
far 
from 
noting 
any 
deficience, 
as 
I 
rather 
note 
an 
excess; 
whereunto 
I 
have 
digressed 
because 
of 
the 
extreme 
prejudice 
which 
both 
religion 
and 
philosophy 
hath 
received 
and 
may 
receive 
by 
being 
commixed 
together; 
as 
that 
which 
undoubtedly 
will 
make 
an 
heretical 
religion, 
and 
an 
imaginary 
and 
fabulous 
philosophy. 


(2) 
Otherwise 
it 
is 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
angels 
and 
spirits, 
which 
is 
an 
appendix 
of 
theology, 
both 
divine 
and 
natural, 
and 
is 
neither 
inscrutable 
nor 
interdicted. 
For 
although 
the 
Scripture 
saith, 
“Let 
no 
man 
deceive 
you 
in 
sublime 
discourse 
touching 
the 
worship 
of 
angels, 
pressing 
into 
that 
he 
knoweth 
not,” 
&c., 
yet 
notwithstanding 
if 
you 
observe 
well 
that 
precept, 
it 
may 
appear 
thereby 
that 
there 
be 
two 
things 
only 
forbidden 
— 
adoration 
of 
them, 
and 
opinion 
fantastical 
of 
them, 
either 
to 
extol 
them 
further 
than 
appertaineth 
to 
the 
degree 
of 
a 
creature, 
or 
to 
extol 
a 
man’s 
knowledge 
of 
them 
further 
than 
he 
hath 
ground. 
But 
the 
sober 
and 
grounded 
inquiry, 
which 
may 
arise 
out 
of 
the 
passages 
of 
Holy 
Scriptures, 
or 
out 
of 
the 
gradations 
of 
nature, 
is 
not 
restrained. 
So 
of 
degenerate 
and 
revolted 
spirits, 
the 
conversing 
with 
them 
or 
the 
employment 
of 
them 
is 
prohibited, 
much 
more 
any 
veneration 
towards 
them; 
but 
the 
contemplation 
or 
science 
of 
their 
nature, 
their 
power, 
their 
illusions, 
either 
by 
Scripture 
or 
reason, 
is 
a 
part 
of 
spiritual 
wisdom. 
For 
so 
the 
apostle 
saith, 
“We 
are 
not 
ignorant 
of 
his 
stratagems.” 
And 
it 
is 
no 
more 
unlawful 
to 
inquire 
the 
nature 
of 
evil 
spirits, 
than 
to 
inquire 
the 
force 
of 
poisons 
in 
nature, 
or 
the 
nature 
of 
sin 
and 
vice 
in 
morality. 
But 
this 
part 
touching 
angels 
and 
spirits 
I 
cannot 
note 
as 
deficient, 
for 
many 
have 
occupied 
themselves 
in 
it; 
I 
may 
rather 
challenge 
it, 
in 
many 
of 
the 
writers 
thereof, 
as 
fabulous 
and 
fantastical. 

VII 


(1) 
Leaving 
therefore 
divine 
philosophy 
or 
natural 
theology 
(not 
divinity 
or 
inspired 
theology, 
which 
we 
reserve 
for 
the 
last 
of 
all 
as 
the 
haven 
and 
sabbath 
of 
all 
man’s 
contemplations) 
we 
will 
now 
proceed 
to 
natural 
philosophy. 
If 
then 
it 
be 
true 
that 
Democritus 
said, 
“That 
the 
truth 
of 
nature 
lieth 
hid 
in 
certain 
deep 
mines 
and 
caves;” 
and 
if 
it 
be 
true 
likewise 
that 
the 
alchemists 
do 
so 
much 
inculcate, 
that 
Vulcan 
is 
a 
second 
nature, 
and 
imitateth 
that 
dexterously 
and 
compendiously, 
which 
nature 
worketh 
by 
ambages 
and 
length 
of 
time, 
it 
were 
good 
to 
divide 
natural 
philosophy 
into 
the 
mine 
and 
the 
furnace, 
and 
to 
make 
two 
professions 
or 
occupations 
of 
natural 
philosophers 
— 
some 
to 
be 
pioneers 
and 
some 
smiths; 
some 
to 
dig, 
and 
some 
to 
refine 
and 
hammer. 
And 
surely 
I 
do 
best 
allow 
of 
a 
division 
of 
that 
kind, 
though 
in 
more 
familiar 
and 
scholastical 
terms: 
namely, 
that 
these 
be 
the 
two 
parts 
of 
natural 
philosophy 
— 
the 
inquisition 
of 
causes, 
and 
the 
production 
of 
effects; 
speculative 
and 
operative; 
natural 
science, 
and 
natural 
prudence. 
For 
as 
in 
civil 
matters 
there 
is 
a 
wisdom 
of 
discourse, 
and 
a 
wisdom 
of 
direction; 
so 
is 
it 
in 
natural. 
And 
here 
I 
will 
make 
a 
request, 
that 
for 
the 
latter 
(or 
at 
least 
for 
a 
part 
thereof) 
I 
may 
revive 
and 
reintegrate 
the 
misapplied 
and 
abused 
name 
of 
natural 
magic, 
which 
in 
the 
true 
sense 
is 
but 
natural 
wisdom, 
or 
natural 
prudence; 
taken 
according 
to 
the 
ancient 
acception, 
purged 
from 
vanity 
and 
superstition. 
Now 
although 
it 
be 
true, 
and 
I 
know 
it 
well, 
that 
there 
is 
an 
intercourse 
between 
causes 
and 
effects, 
so 
as 
both 
these 
knowledges, 
speculative 
and 
operative, 
have 
a 
great 
connection 
between 
themselves; 
yet 
because 
all 
true 
and 
fruitful 
natural 
philosophy 
hath 
a 
double 
scale 
or 
ladder, 
ascendent 
and 
descendent, 
ascending 
from 
experiments 
to 
the 
invention 
of 
causes, 
and 
descending 
from 
causes 
to 
the 
invention 
of 
new 
experiments; 
therefore 
I 
judge 
it 
most 
requisite 
that 
these 
two 
parts 
be 
severally 
considered 
and 
handled. 
(2) 
Natural 
science 
or 
theory 
is 
divided 
into 
physic 
and 
metaphysic; 
wherein 
I 
desire 
it 
may 
be 
conceived 
that 
I 
use 
the 
word 
metaphysic 
in 
a 
differing 
sense 
from 
that 
that 
is 
received. 
And 
in 
like 
manner, 
I 
doubt 
not 
but 
it 
will 
easily 
appear 
to 
men 
of 
judgment, 
that 
in 
this 
and 
other 
particulars, 
wheresoever 
my 
conception 
and 
notion 
may 
differ 
from 
the 
ancient, 
yet 
I 
am 

studious 
to 
keep 
the 
ancient 
terms. 
For 
hoping 
well 
to 
deliver 
myself 
from 
mistaking, 
by 
the 
order 
and 
perspicuous 
expressing 
of 
that 
I 
do 
propound, 
I 
am 
otherwise 
zealous 
and 
affectionate 
to 
recede 
as 
little 
from 
antiquity, 
either 
in 
terms 
or 
opinions, 
as 
may 
stand 
with 
truth 
and 
the 
proficience 
of 
knowledge. 
And 
herein 
I 
cannot 
a 
little 
marvel 
at 
the 
philosopher 
Aristotle, 
that 
did 
proceed 
in 
such 
a 
spirit 
of 
difference 
and 
contradiction 
towards 
all 
antiquity; 
undertaking 
not 
only 
to 
frame 
new 
words 
of 
science 
at 
pleasure, 
but 
to 
confound 
and 
extinguish 
all 
ancient 
wisdom; 
insomuch 
as 
he 
never 
nameth 
or 
mentioneth 
an 
ancient 
author 
or 
opinion, 
but 
to 
confute 
and 
reprove; 
wherein 
for 
glory, 
and 
drawing 
followers 
and 
disciples, 
he 
took 
the 
right 
course. 
For 
certainly 
there 
cometh 
to 
pass, 
and 
hath 
place 
in 
human 
truth, 
that 
which 
was 
noted 
and 
pronounced 
in 
the 
highest 
truth:— 
Veni 
in 
nomine 
partis, 
nec 
recipits 
me; 
si 
quis 
venerit 
in 
nomine 
suo 
eum 
recipietis. 
But 
in 
this 
divine 
aphorism 
(considering 
to 
whom 
it 
was 
applied, 
namely, 
to 
antichrist, 
the 
highest 
deceiver), 
we 
may 
discern 
well 
that 
the 
coming 
in 
a 
man’s 
own 
name, 
without 
regard 
of 
antiquity 
or 
paternity, 
is 
no 
good 
sign 
of 
truth, 
although 
it 
be 
joined 
with 
the 
fortune 
and 
success 
of 
an 
eum 
recipietis. 
But 
for 
this 
excellent 
person 
Aristotle, 
I 
will 
think 
of 
him 
that 
he 
learned 
that 
humour 
of 
his 
scholar, 
with 
whom 
it 
seemeth 
he 
did 
emulate; 
the 
one 
to 
conquer 
all 
opinions, 
as 
the 
other 
to 
conquer 
all 
nations. 
Wherein, 
nevertheless, 
it 
may 
be, 
he 
may 
at 
some 
men’s 
hands, 
that 
are 
of 
a 
bitter 
disposition, 
get 
a 
like 
title 
as 
his 
scholar 
did:— 


“Felix 
terrarum 
praedo, 
non 
utile 
mundo 
Editus 
exemplum, 
&c.” 


So, 


“Felix 
doctrinae 
praedo.” 


But 
to 
me, 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
that 
do 
desire 
as 
much 
as 
lieth 
in 
my 
pen 
to 
ground 
a 
sociable 
intercourse 
between 
antiquity 
and 
proficience, 
it 
seemeth 
best 
to 
keep 
way 
with 
antiquity 
usque 
ad 
aras; 
and, 
therefore, 
to 
retain 
the 
ancient 
terms, 
though 
I 
sometimes 
alter 
the 
uses 
and 
definitions, 
according 
to 
the 
moderate 
proceeding 
in 
civil 
government; 
where, 
although 
there 
be 
some 
alteration, 
yet 
that 
holdeth 
which 
Tacitus 
wisely 
noteth, 
eadem 
magistratuum 
vocabula. 


(3) 
To 
return, 
therefore, 
to 
the 
use 
and 
acception 
of 
the 
term 
metaphysic 
as 
I 
do 
now 
understand 
the 
word; 
it 
appeareth, 
by 
that 
which 
hath 
been 
already 
said, 
that 
I 
intend 
philosophia 
prima, 
summary 
philosophy 
and 

metaphysic, 
which 
heretofore 
have 
been 
confounded 
as 
one, 
to 
be 
two 
distinct 
things. 
For 
the 
one 
I 
have 
made 
as 
a 
parent 
or 
common 
ancestor 
to 
all 
knowledge; 
and 
the 
other 
I 
have 
now 
brought 
in 
as 
a 
branch 
or 
descendant 
of 
natural 
science. 
It 
appeareth 
likewise 
that 
I 
have 
assigned 
to 
summary 
philosophy 
the 
common 
principles 
and 
axioms 
which 
are 
promiscuous 
and 
indifferent 
to 
several 
sciences; 
I 
have 
assigned 
unto 
it 
likewise 
the 
inquiry 
touching 
the 
operation 
or 
the 
relative 
and 
adventive 
characters 
of 
essences, 
as 
quantity, 
similitude, 
diversity, 
possibility, 
and 
the 
rest, 
with 
this 
distinction 
and 
provision; 
that 
they 
be 
handled 
as 
they 
have 
efficacy 
in 
nature, 
and 
not 
logically. 
It 
appeareth 
likewise 
that 
natural 
theology, 
which 
heretofore 
hath 
been 
handled 
confusedly 
with 
metaphysic, 
I 
have 
enclosed 
and 
bounded 
by 
itself. 
It 
is 
therefore 
now 
a 
question 
what 
is 
left 
remaining 
for 
metaphysic; 
wherein 
I 
may 
without 
prejudice 
preserve 
thus 
much 
of 
the 
conceit 
of 
antiquity, 
that 
physic 
should 
contemplate 
that 
which 
is 
inherent 
in 
matter, 
and 
therefore 
transitory; 
and 
metaphysic 
that 
which 
is 
abstracted 
and 
fixed. 
And 
again, 
that 
physic 
should 
handle 
that 
which 
supposeth 
in 
nature 
only 
a 
being 
and 
moving; 
and 
metaphysic 
should 
handle 
that 
which 
supposeth 
further 
in 
nature 
a 
reason, 
understanding, 
and 
platform. 
But 
the 
difference, 
perspicuously 
expressed, 
is 
most 
familiar 
and 
sensible. 
For 
as 
we 
divided 
natural 
philosophy 
in 
general 
into 
the 
inquiry 
of 
causes 
and 
productions 
of 
effects, 
so 
that 
part 
which 
concerneth 
the 
inquiry 
of 
causes 
we 
do 
subdivide 
according 
to 
the 
received 
and 
sound 
division 
of 
causes. 
The 
one 
part, 
which 
is 
physic, 
inquireth 
and 
handleth 
the 
material 
and 
efficient 
causes; 
and 
the 
other, 
which 
is 
metaphysic, 
handleth 
the 
formal 
and 
final 
causes. 


(4) 
Physic 
(taking 
it 
according 
to 
the 
derivation, 
and 
not 
according 
to 
our 
idiom 
for 
medicine) 
is 
situate 
in 
a 
middle 
term 
or 
distance 
between 
natural 
history 
and 
metaphysic. 
For 
natural 
history 
describeth 
the 
variety 
of 
things; 
physic 
the 
causes, 
but 
variable 
or 
respective 
causes; 
and 
metaphysic 
the 
fixed 
and 
constant 
causes. 
“Limus 
ut 
hic 
durescit, 
et 
haec 
ut 
cera 
liquescit, 
Uno 
eodemque 
igni.” 


Fire 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
induration, 
but 
respective 
to 
clay; 
fire 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
colliquation, 
but 
respective 
to 
wax. 
But 
fire 
is 
no 
constant 
cause 
either 
of 
induration 
or 
colliquation; 
so 
then 
the 
physical 
causes 
are 
but 
the 
efficient 
and 
the 
matter. 
Physic 
hath 
three 
parts, 
whereof 
two 
respect 
nature 
united 
or 
collected, 
the 
third 
contemplateth 
nature 
diffused 
or 
distributed. 



Nature 
is 
collected 
either 
into 
one 
entire 
total, 
or 
else 
into 
the 
same 
principles 
or 
seeds. 
So 
as 
the 
first 
doctrine 
is 
touching 
the 
contexture 
or 
configuration 
of 
things, 
as 
de 
mundo, 
de 
universitate 
rerum. 
The 
second 
is 
the 
doctrine 
concerning 
the 
principles 
or 
originals 
of 
things. 
The 
third 
is 
the 
doctrine 
concerning 
all 
variety 
and 
particularity 
of 
things; 
whether 
it 
be 
of 
the 
differing 
substances, 
or 
their 
differing 
qualities 
and 
natures; 
whereof 
there 
needeth 
no 
enumeration, 
this 
part 
being 
but 
as 
a 
gloss 
or 
paraphrase 
that 
attendeth 
upon 
the 
text 
of 
natural 
history. 
Of 
these 
three 
I 
cannot 
report 
any 
as 
deficient. 
In 
what 
truth 
or 
perfection 
they 
are 
handled, 
I 
make 
not 
now 
any 
judgment; 
but 
they 
are 
parts 
of 
knowledge 
not 
deserted 
by 
the 
labour 
of 
man. 


(5) 
For 
metaphysic, 
we 
have 
assigned 
unto 
it 
the 
inquiry 
of 
formal 
and 
final 
causes; 
which 
assignation, 
as 
to 
the 
former 
of 
them, 
may 
seem 
to 
be 
nugatory 
and 
void, 
because 
of 
the 
received 
and 
inveterate 
opinion, 
that 
the 
inquisition 
of 
man 
is 
not 
competent 
to 
find 
out 
essential 
forms 
or 
true 
differences; 
of 
which 
opinion 
we 
will 
take 
this 
hold, 
that 
the 
invention 
of 
forms 
is 
of 
all 
other 
parts 
of 
knowledge 
the 
worthiest 
to 
be 
sought, 
if 
it 
be 
possible 
to 
be 
found. 
As 
for 
the 
possibility, 
they 
are 
ill 
discoverers 
that 
think 
there 
is 
no 
land, 
when 
they 
can 
see 
nothing 
but 
sea. 
But 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
Plato, 
in 
his 
opinion 
of 
ideas, 
as 
one 
that 
had 
a 
wit 
of 
elevation 
situate 
as 
upon 
a 
cliff, 
did 
descry 
that 
forms 
were 
the 
true 
object 
of 
knowledge; 
but 
lost 
the 
real 
fruit 
of 
his 
opinion, 
by 
considering 
of 
forms 
as 
absolutely 
abstracted 
from 
matter, 
and 
not 
confined 
and 
determined 
by 
matter; 
and 
so 
turning 
his 
opinion 
upon 
theology, 
wherewith 
all 
his 
natural 
philosophy 
is 
infected. 
But 
if 
any 
man 
shall 
keep 
a 
continual 
watchful 
and 
severe 
eye 
upon 
action, 
operation, 
and 
the 
use 
of 
knowledge, 
he 
may 
advise 
and 
take 
notice 
what 
are 
the 
forms, 
the 
disclosures 
whereof 
are 
fruitful 
and 
important 
to 
the 
state 
of 
man. 
For 
as 
to 
the 
forms 
of 
substances 
(man 
only 
except, 
of 
whom 
it 
is 
said, 
Formavit 
hominem 
de 
limo 
terrae, 
et 
spiravit 
in 
faciem 
ejus 
spiraculum 
vitae, 
and 
not 
as 
of 
all 
other 
creatures, 
Producant 
aquae, 
producat 
terra), 
the 
forms 
of 
substances 
I 
say 
(as 
they 
are 
now 
by 
compounding 
and 
transplanting 
multiplied) 
are 
so 
perplexed, 
as 
they 
are 
not 
to 
be 
inquired; 
no 
more 
than 
it 
were 
either 
possible 
or 
to 
purpose 
to 
seek 
in 
gross 
the 
forms 
of 
those 
sounds 
which 
make 
words, 
which 
by 
composition 
and 
transposition 
of 
letters 
are 
infinite. 
But, 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
to 
inquire 
the 
form 
of 
those 
sounds 
or 
voices 
which 
make 
simple 
letters 
is 
easily 
comprehensible; 
and 
being 
known 
induceth 
and 
manifesteth 
the 
forms 
of 
all 
words, 
which 
consist 
and 
are 
compounded 
of 
them. 
In 
the 
same 
manner 
to 
inquire 
the 
form 
of 
a 
lion, 
of 
an 

oak, 
of 
gold; 
nay, 
of 
water, 
of 
air, 
is 
a 
vain 
pursuit; 
but 
to 
inquire 
the 
forms 
of 
sense, 
of 
voluntary 
motion, 
of 
vegetation, 
of 
colours, 
of 
gravity 
and 
levity, 
of 
density, 
of 
tenuity, 
of 
heat, 
of 
cold, 
and 
all 
other 
natures 
and 
qualities, 
which, 
like 
an 
alphabet, 
are 
not 
many, 
and 
of 
which 
the 
essences 
(upheld 
by 
matter) 
of 
all 
creatures 
do 
consist; 
to 
inquire, 
I 
say, 
the 
true 
forms 
of 
these, 
is 
that 
part 
of 
metaphysic 
which 
we 
now 
define 
of. 
Not 
but 
that 
physic 
doth 
make 
inquiry 
and 
take 
consideration 
of 
the 
same 
natures; 
but 
how? 
Only 
as 
to 
the 
material 
and 
efficient 
causes 
of 
them, 
and 
not 
as 
to 
the 
forms. 
For 
example, 
if 
the 
cause 
of 
whiteness 
in 
snow 
or 
froth 
be 
inquired, 
and 
it 
be 
rendered 
thus, 
that 
the 
subtle 
intermixture 
of 
air 
and 
water 
is 
the 
cause, 
it 
is 
well 
rendered; 
but, 
nevertheless, 
is 
this 
the 
form 
of 
whiteness? 
No; 
but 
it 
is 
the 
efficient, 
which 
is 
ever 
but 
vehiculum 
formae. 
This 
part 
of 
metaphysic 
I 
do 
not 
find 
laboured 
and 
performed; 
whereat 
I 
marvel 
not; 
because 
I 
hold 
it 
not 
possible 
to 
be 
invented 
by 
that 
course 
of 
invention 
which 
hath 
been 
used; 
in 
regard 
that 
men 
(which 
is 
the 
root 
of 
all 
error) 
have 
made 
too 
untimely 
a 
departure, 
and 
too 
remote 
a 
recess 
from 
particulars. 


(6) 
But 
the 
use 
of 
this 
part 
of 
metaphysic, 
which 
I 
report 
as 
deficient, 
is 
of 
the 
rest 
the 
most 
excellent 
in 
two 
respects: 
the 
one, 
because 
it 
is 
the 
duty 
and 
virtue 
of 
all 
knowledge 
to 
abridge 
the 
infinity 
of 
individual 
experience, 
as 
much 
as 
the 
conception 
of 
truth 
will 
permit, 
and 
to 
remedy 
the 
complaint 
of 
vita 
brevis, 
ars 
longa; 
which 
is 
performed 
by 
uniting 
the 
notions 
and 
conceptions 
of 
sciences. 
For 
knowledges 
are 
as 
pyramids, 
whereof 
history 
is 
the 
basis. 
So 
of 
natural 
philosophy, 
the 
basis 
is 
natural 
history; 
the 
stage 
next 
the 
basis 
is 
physic; 
the 
stage 
next 
the 
vertical 
point 
is 
metaphysic. 
As 
for 
the 
vertical 
point, 
opus 
quod 
operatur 
Deus 
a 
principio 
usque 
ad 
finem, 
the 
summary 
law 
of 
nature, 
we 
know 
not 
whether 
man’s 
inquiry 
can 
attain 
unto 
it. 
But 
these 
three 
be 
the 
true 
stages 
of 
knowledge, 
and 
are 
to 
them 
that 
are 
depraved 
no 
better 
than 
the 
giants’ 
hills:— 
“Ter 
sunt 
conati 
imponere 
Pelio 
Ossam, 
Scilicet 
atque 
Ossae 
frondsum 
involvere 
Olympum.” 


But 
to 
those 
which 
refer 
all 
things 
to 
the 
glory 
of 
God, 
they 
are 
as 
the 
three 
acclamations, 
Sante, 
sancte, 
sancte! 
holy 
in 
the 
description 
or 
dilatation 
of 
His 
works; 
holy 
in 
the 
connection 
or 
concatenation 
of 
them; 
and 
holy 
in 
the 
union 
of 
them 
in 
a 
perpetual 
and 
uniform 
law. 
And, 
therefore, 
the 
speculation 
was 
excellent 
in 
Parmenides 
and 
Plato, 
although 
but 
a 
speculation 
in 
them, 
that 
all 
things 
by 
scale 
did 
ascend 
to 
unity. 
So 
then 
always 
that 



knowledge 
is 
worthiest 
which 
is 
charged 
with 
least 
multiplicity, 
which 
appeareth 
to 
be 
metaphysic; 
as 
that 
which 
considereth 
the 
simple 
forms 
or 
differences 
of 
things, 
which 
are 
few 
in 
number, 
and 
the 
degrees 
and 
coordinations 
whereof 
make 
all 
this 
variety. 
The 
second 
respect, 
which 
valueth 
and 
commendeth 
this 
part 
of 
metaphysic, 
is 
that 
it 
doth 
enfranchise 
the 
power 
of 
man 
unto 
the 
greatest 
liberty 
and 
possibility 
of 
works 
and 
effects. 
For 
physic 
carrieth 
men 
in 
narrow 
and 
restrained 
ways, 
subject 
to 
many 
accidents 
and 
impediments, 
imitating 
the 
ordinary 
flexuous 
courses 
of 
nature. 
But 
latae 
undique 
sunt 
sapientibus 
viae; 
to 
sapience 
(which 
was 
anciently 
defined 
to 
be 
rerum 
divinarum 
et 
humanarum 
scientia) 
there 
is 
ever 
a 
choice 
of 
means. 
For 
physical 
causes 
give 
light 
to 
new 
invention 
in 
simili 
materia. 
But 
whosoever 
knoweth 
any 
form, 
knoweth 
the 
utmost 
possibility 
of 
superinducing 
that 
nature 
upon 
any 
variety 
of 
matter; 
and 
so 
is 
less 
restrained 
in 
operation, 
either 
to 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
matter, 
or 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
efficient; 
which 
kind 
of 
knowledge 
Solomon 
likewise, 
though 
in 
a 
more 
divine 
sense, 
elegantly 
describeth: 
non 
arctabuntur 
gressus 
tui, 
et 
currens 
non 
habebis 
offendiculum. 
The 
ways 
of 
sapience 
are 
not 
much 
liable 
either 
to 
particularity 
or 
chance. 


(7) 
The 
second 
part 
of 
metaphysic 
is 
the 
inquiry 
of 
final 
causes, 
which 
I 
am 
moved 
to 
report 
not 
as 
omitted, 
but 
as 
misplaced. 
And 
yet 
if 
it 
were 
but 
a 
fault 
in 
order, 
I 
would 
not 
speak 
of 
it; 
for 
order 
is 
matter 
of 
illustration, 
but 
pertaineth 
not 
to 
the 
substance 
of 
sciences. 
But 
this 
misplacing 
hath 
caused 
a 
deficience, 
or 
at 
least 
a 
great 
improficience 
in 
the 
sciences 
themselves. 
For 
the 
handling 
of 
final 
causes, 
mixed 
with 
the 
rest 
in 
physical 
inquiries, 
hath 
intercepted 
the 
severe 
and 
diligent 
inquiry 
of 
all 
real 
and 
physical 
causes, 
and 
given 
men 
the 
occasion 
to 
stay 
upon 
these 
satisfactory 
and 
specious 
causes, 
to 
the 
great 
arrest 
and 
prejudice 
of 
further 
discovery. 
For 
this 
I 
find 
done 
not 
only 
by 
Plato, 
who 
ever 
anchoreth 
upon 
that 
shore, 
but 
by 
Aristotle, 
Galen, 
and 
others 
which 
do 
usually 
likewise 
fall 
upon 
these 
flats 
of 
discoursing 
causes. 
For 
to 
say 
that 
“the 
hairs 
of 
the 
eyelids 
are 
for 
a 
quickset 
and 
fence 
about 
the 
sight;” 
or 
that 
“the 
firmness 
of 
the 
skins 
and 
hides 
of 
living 
creatures 
is 
to 
defend 
them 
from 
the 
extremities 
of 
heat 
or 
cold;” 
or 
that 
“the 
bones 
are 
for 
the 
columns 
or 
beams, 
whereupon 
the 
frames 
of 
the 
bodies 
of 
living 
creatures 
are 
built;” 
or 
that 
“the 
leaves 
of 
trees 
are 
for 
protecting 
of 
the 
fruit;” 
or 
that 
“the 
clouds 
are 
for 
watering 
of 
the 
earth;” 
or 
that 
“the 
solidness 
of 
the 
earth 
is 
for 
the 
station 
and 
mansion 
of 
living 
creatures;” 
and 
the 
like, 
is 
well 
inquired 
and 
collected 
in 
metaphysic, 
but 
in 
physic 
they 
are 
impertinent. 
Nay, 
they 
are, 
indeed, 
but 
remoras 
and 

hindrances 
to 
stay 
and 
slug 
the 
ship 
from 
further 
sailing; 
and 
have 
brought 
this 
to 
pass, 
that 
the 
search 
of 
the 
physical 
causes 
hath 
been 
neglected 
and 
passed 
in 
silence. 
And, 
therefore, 
the 
natural 
philosophy 
of 
Democritus 
and 
some 
others, 
who 
did 
not 
suppose 
a 
mind 
or 
reason 
in 
the 
frame 
of 
things, 
but 
attributed 
the 
form 
thereof 
able 
to 
maintain 
itself 
to 
infinite 
essays 
or 
proofs 
of 
Nature, 
which 
they 
term 
fortune, 
seemeth 
to 
me 
(as 
far 
as 
I 
can 
judge 
by 
the 
recital 
and 
fragments 
which 
remain 
unto 
us) 
in 
particularities 
of 
physical 
causes 
more 
real 
and 
better 
inquired 
than 
that 
of 
Aristotle 
and 
Plato; 
whereof 
both 
intermingled 
final 
causes, 
the 
one 
as 
a 
part 
of 
theology, 
and 
the 
other 
as 
a 
part 
of 
logic, 
which 
were 
the 
favourite 
studies 
respectively 
of 
both 
those 
persons; 
not 
because 
those 
final 
causes 
are 
not 
true 
and 
worthy 
to 
be 
inquired, 
being 
kept 
within 
their 
own 
province, 
but 
because 
their 
excursions 
into 
the 
limits 
of 
physical 
causes 
hath 
bred 
a 
vastness 
and 
solitude 
in 
that 
tract. 
For 
otherwise, 
keeping 
their 
precincts 
and 
borders, 
men 
are 
extremely 
deceived 
if 
they 
think 
there 
is 
an 
enmity 
or 
repugnancy 
at 
all 
between 
them. 
For 
the 
cause 
rendered, 
that 
“the 
hairs 
about 
the 
eyelids 
are 
for 
the 
safeguard 
of 
the 
sight,” 
doth 
not 
impugn 
the 
cause 
rendered, 
that 
“pilosity 
is 
incident 
to 
orifices 
of 
moisture 
— 
muscosi 
fontes, 
&c.” 
Nor 
the 
cause 
rendered, 
that 
“the 
firmness 
of 
hides 
is 
for 
the 
armour 
of 
the 
body 
against 
extremities 
of 
heat 
or 
cold,” 
doth 
not 
impugn 
the 
cause 
rendered, 
that 
“contraction 
of 
pores 
is 
incident 
to 
the 
outwardest 
parts, 
in 
regard 
of 
their 
adjacence 
to 
foreign 
or 
unlike 
bodies;” 
and 
so 
of 
the 
rest, 
both 
causes 
being 
true 
and 
compatible, 
the 
one 
declaring 
an 
intention, 
the 
other 
a 
consequence 
only. 
Neither 
doth 
this 
call 
in 
question 
or 
derogate 
from 
Divine 
Providence, 
but 
highly 
confirm 
and 
exalt 
it. 
For 
as 
in 
civil 
actions 
he 
is 
the 
greater 
and 
deeper 
politique 
that 
can 
make 
other 
men 
the 
instruments 
of 
his 
will 
and 
ends, 
and 
yet 
never 
acquaint 
them 
with 
his 
purpose, 
so 
as 
they 
shall 
do 
it 
and 
yet 
not 
know 
what 
they 
do, 
than 
he 
that 
imparteth 
his 
meaning 
to 
those 
he 
employeth; 
so 
is 
the 
wisdom 
of 
God 
more 
admirable, 
when 
Nature 
intendeth 
one 
thing 
and 
Providence 
draweth 
forth 
another, 
than 
if 
He 
had 
communicated 
to 
particular 
creatures 
and 
motions 
the 
characters 
and 
impressions 
of 
His 
Providence. 
And 
thus 
much 
for 
metaphysic; 
the 
latter 
part 
whereof 
I 
allow 
as 
extant, 
but 
wish 
it 
confined 
to 
his 
proper 
place. 



VIII 


(1) 
Nevertheless, 
there 
remaineth 
yet 
another 
part 
of 
natural 
philosophy, 
which 
is 
commonly 
made 
a 
principal 
part, 
and 
holdeth 
rank 
with 
physic 
special 
and 
metaphysic, 
which 
is 
mathematic; 
but 
I 
think 
it 
more 
agreeable 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
and 
to 
the 
light 
of 
order, 
to 
place 
it 
as 
a 
branch 
of 
metaphysic. 
For 
the 
subject 
of 
it 
being 
quantity, 
not 
quantity 
indefinite, 
which 
is 
but 
a 
relative, 
and 
belongeth 
to 
philosophia 
prima 
(as 
hath 
been 
said), 
but 
quantity 
determined 
or 
proportionable, 
it 
appeareth 
to 
be 
one 
of 
the 
essential 
forms 
of 
things, 
as 
that 
that 
is 
causative 
in 
Nature 
of 
a 
number 
of 
effects; 
insomuch 
as 
we 
see 
in 
the 
schools 
both 
of 
Democritus 
and 
of 
Pythagoras 
that 
the 
one 
did 
ascribe 
figure 
to 
the 
first 
seeds 
of 
things, 
and 
the 
other 
did 
suppose 
numbers 
to 
be 
the 
principles 
and 
originals 
of 
things. 
And 
it 
is 
true 
also 
that 
of 
all 
other 
forms 
(as 
we 
understand 
forms) 
it 
is 
the 
most 
abstracted 
and 
separable 
from 
matter, 
and 
therefore 
most 
proper 
to 
metaphysic; 
which 
hath 
likewise 
been 
the 
cause 
why 
it 
hath 
been 
better 
laboured 
and 
inquired 
than 
any 
of 
the 
other 
forms, 
which 
are 
more 
immersed 
in 
matter. 
For 
it 
being 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
(to 
the 
extreme 
prejudice 
of 
knowledge) 
to 
delight 
in 
the 
spacious 
liberty 
of 
generalities, 
as 
in 
a 
champaign 
region, 
and 
not 
in 
the 
inclosures 
of 
particularity, 
the 
mathematics 
of 
all 
other 
knowledge 
were 
the 
goodliest 
fields 
to 
satisfy 
that 
appetite. 
But 
for 
the 
placing 
of 
this 
science, 
it 
is 
not 
much 
material: 
only 
we 
have 
endeavoured 
in 
these 
our 
partitions 
to 
observe 
a 
kind 
of 
perspective, 
that 
one 
part 
may 
cast 
light 
upon 
another. 
(2) 
The 
mathematics 
are 
either 
pure 
or 
mixed. 
To 
the 
pure 
mathematics 
are 
those 
sciences 
belonging 
which 
handle 
quantity 
determinate, 
merely 
severed 
from 
any 
axioms 
of 
natural 
philosophy; 
and 
these 
are 
two, 
geometry 
and 
arithmetic, 
the 
one 
handling 
quantity 
continued, 
and 
the 
other 
dissevered. 
Mixed 
hath 
for 
subject 
some 
axioms 
or 
parts 
of 
natural 
philosophy, 
and 
considereth 
quantity 
determined, 
as 
it 
is 
auxiliary 
and 
incident 
unto 
them. 
For 
many 
parts 
of 
Nature 
can 
neither 
be 
invented 
with 
sufficient 
subtlety, 
nor 
demonstrated 
with 
sufficient 
perspicuity, 
nor 
accommodated 
unto 
use 
with 
sufficient 
dexterity, 
without 
the 
aid 
and 
intervening 
of 
the 
mathematics, 
of 
which 
sort 
are 
perspective, 
music, 

astronomy, 
cosmography, 
architecture, 
engineery, 
and 
divers 
others. 
In 
the 
mathematics 
I 
can 
report 
no 
deficience, 
except 
it 
be 
that 
men 
do 
not 
sufficiently 
understand 
this 
excellent 
use 
of 
the 
pure 
mathematics, 
in 
that 
they 
do 
remedy 
and 
cure 
many 
defects 
in 
the 
wit 
and 
faculties 
intellectual. 
For 
if 
the 
wit 
be 
too 
dull, 
they 
sharpen 
it; 
if 
too 
wandering, 
they 
fix 
it; 
if 
too 
inherent 
in 
the 
sense, 
they 
abstract 
it. 
So 
that 
as 
tennis 
is 
a 
game 
of 
no 
use 
in 
itself, 
but 
of 
great 
use 
in 
respect 
it 
maketh 
a 
quick 
eye 
and 
a 
body 
ready 
to 
put 
itself 
into 
all 
postures, 
so 
in 
the 
mathematics 
that 
use 
which 
is 
collateral 
and 
intervenient 
is 
no 
less 
worthy 
than 
that 
which 
is 
principal 
and 
intended. 
And 
as 
for 
the 
mixed 
mathematics, 
I 
may 
only 
make 
this 
prediction, 
that 
there 
cannot 
fail 
to 
be 
more 
kinds 
of 
them 
as 
Nature 
grows 
further 
disclosed. 
Thus 
much 
of 
natural 
science, 
or 
the 
part 
of 
Nature 
speculative. 


(3) 
For 
natural 
prudence, 
or 
the 
part 
operative 
of 
natural 
philosophy, 
we 
will 
divide 
it 
into 
three 
parts 
— 
experimental, 
philosophical, 
and 
magical; 
which 
three 
parts 
active 
have 
a 
correspondence 
and 
analogy 
with 
the 
three 
parts 
speculative, 
natural 
history, 
physic, 
and 
metaphysic. 
For 
many 
operations 
have 
been 
invented, 
sometimes 
by 
a 
casual 
incidence 
and 
occurrence, 
sometimes 
by 
a 
purposed 
experiment; 
and 
of 
those 
which 
have 
been 
found 
by 
an 
intentional 
experiment, 
some 
have 
been 
found 
out 
by 
varying 
or 
extending 
the 
same 
experiment, 
some 
by 
transferring 
and 
compounding 
divers 
experiments 
the 
one 
into 
the 
other, 
which 
kind 
of 
invention 
an 
empiric 
may 
manage. 
Again, 
by 
the 
knowledge 
of 
physical 
causes 
there 
cannot 
fail 
to 
follow 
many 
indications 
and 
designations 
of 
new 
particulars, 
if 
men 
in 
their 
speculation 
will 
keep 
one 
eye 
upon 
use 
and 
practice. 
But 
these 
are 
but 
coastings 
along 
the 
shore, 
premendo 
littus 
iniquum; 
for 
it 
seemeth 
to 
me 
there 
can 
hardly 
be 
discovered 
any 
radical 
or 
fundamental 
alterations 
and 
innovations 
in 
Nature, 
either 
by 
the 
fortune 
and 
essays 
of 
experiments, 
or 
by 
the 
light 
and 
direction 
of 
physical 
causes. 
If, 
therefore, 
we 
have 
reported 
metaphysic 
deficient, 
it 
must 
follow 
that 
we 
do 
the 
like 
of 
natural 
magic, 
which 
hath 
relation 
thereunto. 
For 
as 
for 
the 
natural 
magic 
whereof 
now 
there 
is 
mention 
in 
books, 
containing 
certain 
credulous 
and 
superstitious 
conceits 
and 
observations 
of 
sympathies 
and 
antipathies, 
and 
hidden 
proprieties, 
and 
some 
frivolous 
experiments, 
strange 
rather 
by 
disguisement 
than 
in 
themselves, 
it 
is 
as 
far 
differing 
in 
truth 
of 
Nature 
from 
such 
a 
knowledge 
as 
we 
require 
as 
the 
story 
of 
King 
Arthur 
of 
Britain, 
or 
Hugh 
of 
Bourdeaux, 
differs 
from 
Caesar’s 
Commentaries 
in 
truth 
of 
story; 
for 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
Caesar 
did 
greater 
things 
de 
vero 
than 
those 
imaginary 

heroes 
were 
feigned 
to 
do. 
But 
he 
did 
them 
not 
in 
that 
fabulous 
manner. 
Of 
this 
kind 
of 
learning 
the 
fable 
of 
Ixion 
was 
a 
figure, 
who 
designed 
to 
enjoy 
Juno, 
the 
goddess 
of 
power, 
and 
instead 
of 
her 
had 
copulation 
with 
a 
cloud, 
of 
which 
mixture 
were 
begotten 
centaurs 
and 
chimeras. 
So 
whosoever 
shall 
entertain 
high 
and 
vaporous 
imaginations, 
instead 
of 
a 
laborious 
and 
sober 
inquiry 
of 
truth, 
shall 
beget 
hopes 
and 
beliefs 
of 
strange 
and 
impossible 
shapes. 
And, 
therefore, 
we 
may 
note 
in 
these 
sciences 
which 
hold 
so 
much 
of 
imagination 
and 
belief, 
as 
this 
degenerate 
natural 
magic, 
alchemy, 
astrology, 
and 
the 
like, 
that 
in 
their 
propositions 
the 
description 
of 
the 
means 
is 
ever 
more 
monstrous 
than 
the 
pretence 
or 
end. 
For 
it 
is 
a 
thing 
more 
probable 
that 
he 
that 
knoweth 
well 
the 
natures 
of 
weight, 
of 
colour, 
of 
pliant 
and 
fragile 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
hammer, 
of 
volatile 
and 
fixed 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
fire, 
and 
the 
rest, 
may 
superinduce 
upon 
some 
metal 
the 
nature 
and 
form 
of 
gold 
by 
such 
mechanic 
as 
longeth 
to 
the 
production 
of 
the 
natures 
afore 
rehearsed, 
than 
that 
some 
grains 
of 
the 
medicine 
projected 
should 
in 
a 
few 
moments 
of 
time 
turn 
a 
sea 
of 
quicksilver 
or 
other 
material 
into 
gold. 
So 
it 
is 
more 
probable 
that 
he 
that 
knoweth 
the 
nature 
of 
arefaction, 
the 
nature 
of 
assimilation 
of 
nourishment 
to 
the 
thing 
nourished, 
the 
manner 
of 
increase 
and 
clearing 
of 
spirits, 
the 
manner 
of 
the 
depredations 
which 
spirits 
make 
upon 
the 
humours 
and 
solid 
parts, 
shall 
by 
ambages 
of 
diets, 
bathings, 
anointings, 
medicines, 
motions, 
and 
the 
like, 
prolong 
life, 
or 
restore 
some 
degree 
of 
youth 
or 
vivacity, 
than 
that 
it 
can 
be 
done 
with 
the 
use 
of 
a 
few 
drops 
or 
scruples 
of 
a 
liquor 
or 
receipt. 
To 
conclude, 
therefore, 
the 
true 
natural 
magic, 
which 
is 
that 
great 
liberty 
and 
latitude 
of 
operation 
which 
dependeth 
upon 
the 
knowledge 
of 
forms, 
I 
may 
report 
deficient, 
as 
the 
relative 
thereof 
is. 
To 
which 
part, 
if 
we 
be 
serious 
and 
incline 
not 
to 
vanities 
and 
plausible 
discourse, 
besides 
the 
deriving 
and 
deducing 
the 
operations 
themselves 
from 
metaphysic, 
there 
are 
pertinent 
two 
points 
of 
much 
purpose, 
the 
one 
by 
way 
of 
preparation, 
the 
other 
by 
way 
of 
caution. 
The 
first 
is, 
that 
there 
be 
made 
a 
calendar, 
resembling 
an 
inventory 
of 
the 
estate 
of 
man, 
containing 
all 
the 
inventions 
(being 
the 
works 
or 
fruits 
of 
Nature 
or 
art) 
which 
are 
now 
extant, 
and 
whereof 
man 
is 
already 
possessed; 
out 
of 
which 
doth 
naturally 
result 
a 
note 
what 
things 
are 
yet 
held 
impossible, 
or 
not 
invented, 
which 
calendar 
will 
be 
the 
more 
artificial 
and 
serviceable 
if 
to 
every 
reputed 
impossibility 
you 
add 
what 
thing 
is 
extant 
which 
cometh 
the 
nearest 
in 
degree 
to 
that 
impossibility; 
to 
the 
end 
that 
by 
these 
optatives 
and 
potentials 
man’s 
inquiry 
may 
be 
the 
more 
awake 
in 
deducing 
direction 
of 
works 
from 
the 
speculation 
of 
causes. 



And 
secondly, 
that 
these 
experiments 
be 
not 
only 
esteemed 
which 
have 
an 
immediate 
and 
present 
use, 
but 
those 
principally 
which 
are 
of 
most 
universal 
consequence 
for 
invention 
of 
other 
experiments, 
and 
those 
which 
give 
most 
light 
to 
the 
invention 
of 
causes; 
for 
the 
invention 
of 
the 
mariner’s 
needle, 
which 
giveth 
the 
direction, 
is 
of 
no 
less 
benefit 
for 
navigation 
than 
the 
invention 
of 
the 
sails 
which 
give 
the 
motion. 


(4) 
Thus 
have 
I 
passed 
through 
natural 
philosophy 
and 
the 
deficiences 
thereof; 
wherein 
if 
I 
have 
differed 
from 
the 
ancient 
and 
received 
doctrines, 
and 
thereby 
shall 
move 
contradiction, 
for 
my 
part, 
as 
I 
affect 
not 
to 
dissent, 
so 
I 
purpose 
not 
to 
contend. 
If 
it 
be 
truth, 
“Non 
canimus 
surdis, 
respondent 
omnia 
sylvae,” 


the 
voice 
of 
Nature 
will 
consent, 
whether 
the 
voice 
of 
man 
do 
or 
no. 
And 
as 
Alexander 
Borgia 
was 
wont 
to 
say 
of 
the 
expedition 
of 
the 
French 
for 
Naples, 
that 
they 
came 
with 
chalk 
in 
their 
hands 
to 
mark 
up 
their 
lodgings, 
and 
not 
with 
weapons 
to 
fight; 
so 
I 
like 
better 
that 
entry 
of 
truth 
which 
cometh 
peaceably 
with 
chalk 
to 
mark 
up 
those 
minds 
which 
are 
capable 
to 
lodge 
and 
harbour 
it, 
than 
that 
which 
cometh 
with 
pugnacity 
and 
contention. 


(5) 
But 
there 
remaineth 
a 
division 
of 
natural 
philosophy 
according 
to 
the 
report 
of 
the 
inquiry, 
and 
nothing 
concerning 
the 
matter 
or 
subject: 
and 
that 
is 
positive 
and 
considerative, 
when 
the 
inquiry 
reporteth 
either 
an 
assertion 
or 
a 
doubt. 
These 
doubts 
or 
non 
liquets 
are 
of 
two 
sorts, 
particular 
and 
total. 
For 
the 
first, 
we 
see 
a 
good 
example 
thereof 
in 
Aristotle’s 
Problems 
which 
deserved 
to 
have 
had 
a 
better 
continuance; 
but 
so 
nevertheless 
as 
there 
is 
one 
point 
whereof 
warning 
is 
to 
be 
given 
and 
taken. 
The 
registering 
of 
doubts 
hath 
two 
excellent 
uses: 
the 
one, 
that 
it 
saveth 
philosophy 
from 
errors 
and 
falsehoods; 
when 
that 
which 
is 
not 
fully 
appearing 
is 
not 
collected 
into 
assertion, 
whereby 
error 
might 
draw 
error, 
but 
reserved 
in 
doubt; 
the 
other, 
that 
the 
entry 
of 
doubts 
are 
as 
so 
many 
suckers 
or 
sponges 
to 
draw 
use 
of 
knowledge; 
insomuch 
as 
that 
which 
if 
doubts 
had 
not 
preceded, 
a 
man 
should 
never 
have 
advised, 
but 
passed 
it 
over 
without 
note, 
by 
the 
suggestion 
and 
solicitation 
of 
doubts 
is 
made 
to 
be 
attended 
and 
applied. 
But 
both 
these 
commodities 
do 
scarcely 
countervail 
and 
inconvenience, 
which 
will 
intrude 
itself 
if 
it 
be 
not 
debarred; 
which 
is, 
that 
when 
a 
doubt 
is 
once 
received, 
men 
labour 
rather 
how 
to 
keep 
it 
a 
doubt 
still, 
than 
how 
to 
solve 
it, 
and 
accordingly 
bend 
their 
wits. 
Of 
this 
we 
see 
the 
familiar 
example 
in 
lawyers 

and 
scholars, 
both 
which, 
if 
they 
have 
once 
admitted 
a 
doubt, 
it 
goeth 
ever 
after 
authorised 
for 
a 
doubt. 
But 
that 
use 
of 
wit 
and 
knowledge 
is 
to 
be 
allowed, 
which 
laboureth 
to 
make 
doubtful 
things 
certain, 
and 
not 
those 
which 
labour 
to 
make 
certain 
things 
doubtful. 
Therefore 
these 
calendars 
of 
doubts 
I 
commend 
as 
excellent 
things; 
so 
that 
there 
he 
this 
caution 
used, 
that 
when 
they 
be 
thoroughly 
sifted 
and 
brought 
to 
resolution, 
they 
be 
from 
thenceforth 
omitted, 
discarded, 
and 
not 
continued 
to 
cherish 
and 
encourage 
men 
in 
doubting. 
To 
which 
calendar 
of 
doubts 
or 
problems 
I 
advise 
be 
annexed 
another 
calendar, 
as 
much 
or 
more 
material 
which 
is 
a 
calendar 
of 
popular 
errors: 
I 
mean 
chiefly 
in 
natural 
history, 
such 
as 
pass 
in 
speech 
and 
conceit, 
and 
are 
nevertheless 
apparently 
detected 
and 
convicted 
of 
untruth, 
that 
man’s 
knowledge 
be 
not 
weakened 
nor 
embased 
by 
such 
dross 
and 
vanity. 
As 
for 
the 
doubts 
or 
non 
liquets 
general 
or 
in 
total, 
I 
understand 
those 
differences 
of 
opinions 
touching 
the 
principles 
of 
nature, 
and 
the 
fundamental 
points 
of 
the 
same, 
which 
have 
caused 
the 
diversity 
of 
sects, 
schools, 
and 
philosophies, 
as 
that 
of 
Empedocles, 
Pythagoras, 
Democritus, 
Parmenides, 
and 
the 
rest. 
For 
although 
Aristotle, 
as 
though 
he 
had 
been 
of 
the 
race 
of 
the 
Ottomans, 
thought 
he 
could 
not 
reign 
except 
the 
first 
thing 
he 
did 
he 
killed 
all 
his 
brethren; 
yet 
to 
those 
that 
seek 
truth 
and 
not 
magistrality, 
it 
cannot 
but 
seem 
a 
matter 
of 
great 
profit, 
to 
see 
before 
them 
the 
several 
opinions 
touching 
the 
foundations 
of 
nature. 
Not 
for 
any 
exact 
truth 
that 
can 
be 
expected 
in 
those 
theories; 
for 
as 
the 
same 
phenomena 
in 
astronomy 
are 
satisfied 
by 
this 
received 
astronomy 
of 
the 
diurnal 
motion, 
and 
the 
proper 
motions 
of 
the 
planets, 
with 
their 
eccentrics 
and 
epicycles, 
and 
likewise 
by 
the 
theory 
of 
Copernicus, 
who 
supposed 
the 
earth 
to 
move, 
and 
the 
calculations 
are 
indifferently 
agreeable 
to 
both, 
so 
the 
ordinary 
face 
and 
view 
of 
experience 
is 
many 
times 
satisfied 
by 
several 
theories 
and 
philosophies; 
whereas 
to 
find 
the 
real 
truth 
requireth 
another 
manner 
of 
severity 
and 
attention. 
For 
as 
Aristotle 
saith, 
that 
children 
at 
the 
first 
will 
call 
every 
woman 
mother, 
but 
afterward 
they 
come 
to 
distinguish 
according 
to 
truth, 
so 
experience, 
if 
it 
be 
in 
childhood, 
will 
call 
every 
philosophy 
mother, 
but 
when 
it 
cometh 
to 
ripeness 
it 
will 
discern 
the 
true 
mother. 
So 
as 
in 
the 
meantime 
it 
is 
good 
to 
see 
the 
several 
glosses 
and 
opinions 
upon 
Nature, 
whereof 
it 
may 
be 
everyone 
in 
some 
one 
point 
hath 
seen 
clearer 
than 
his 
fellows, 
therefore 
I 
wish 
some 
collection 
to 
be 
made 
painfully 
and 
understandingly 
de 
antiquis 
philosophiis, 
out 
of 
all 
the 
possible 
light 
which 
remaineth 
to 
us 
of 
them: 
which 
kind 
of 
work 
I 
find 
deficient. 
But 
here 
I 
must 
give 
warning, 
that 
it 
be 
done 
distinctly 



and 
severedly; 
the 
philosophies 
of 
everyone 
throughout 
by 
themselves, 
and 
not 
by 
titles 
packed 
and 
faggoted 
up 
together, 
as 
hath 
been 
done 
by 
Plutarch. 
For 
it 
is 
the 
harmony 
of 
a 
philosophy 
in 
itself, 
which 
giveth 
it 
light 
and 
credence; 
whereas 
if 
it 
be 
singled 
and 
broken, 
it 
will 
seem 
more 
foreign 
and 
dissonant. 
For 
as 
when 
I 
read 
in 
Tacitus 
the 
actions 
of 
Nero 
or 
Claudius, 
with 
circumstances 
of 
times, 
inducements, 
and 
occasions, 
I 
find 
them 
not 
so 
strange; 
but 
when 
I 
read 
them 
in 
Suetonius 
Tranquillus, 
gathered 
into 
titles 
and 
bundles 
and 
not 
in 
order 
of 
time, 
they 
seem 
more 
monstrous 
and 
incredible: 
so 
is 
it 
of 
any 
philosophy 
reported 
entire, 
and 
dismembered 
by 
articles. 
Neither 
do 
I 
exclude 
opinions 
of 
latter 
times 
to 
be 
likewise 
represented 
in 
this 
calendar 
of 
sects 
of 
philosophy, 
as 
that 
of 
Theophrastus 
Paracelsus, 
eloquently 
reduced 
into 
an 
harmony 
by 
the 
pen 
of 
Severinus 
the 
Dane; 
and 
that 
of 
Tilesius, 
and 
his 
scholar 
Donius, 
being 
as 
a 
pastoral 
philosophy, 
full 
of 
sense, 
but 
of 
no 
great 
depth; 
and 
that 
of 
Fracastorius, 
who, 
though 
he 
pretended 
not 
to 
make 
any 
new 
philosophy, 
yet 
did 
use 
the 
absoluteness 
of 
his 
own 
sense 
upon 
the 
old; 
and 
that 
of 
Gilbertus 
our 
countryman, 
who 
revived, 
with 
some 
alterations 
and 
demonstrations, 
the 
opinions 
of 
Xenophanes; 
and 
any 
other 
worthy 
to 
be 
admitted. 


(6) 
Thus 
have 
we 
now 
dealt 
with 
two 
of 
the 
three 
beams 
of 
man’s 
knowledge; 
that 
is 
radius 
directus, 
which 
is 
referred 
to 
nature, 
radius 
refractus, 
which 
is 
referred 
to 
God, 
and 
cannot 
report 
truly 
because 
of 
the 
inequality 
of 
the 
medium. 
There 
resteth 
radius 
reflexus, 
whereby 
man 
beholdeth 
and 
contemplateth 
himself. 

IX 


(1) 
We 
come 
therefore 
now 
to 
that 
knowledge 
whereunto 
the 
ancient 
oracle 
directeth 
us, 
which 
is 
the 
knowledge 
of 
ourselves; 
which 
deserveth 
the 
more 
accurate 
handling, 
by 
how 
much 
it 
toucheth 
us 
more 
nearly. 
This 
knowledge, 
as 
it 
is 
the 
end 
and 
term 
of 
natural 
philosophy 
in 
the 
intention 
of 
man, 
so 
notwithstanding 
it 
is 
but 
a 
portion 
of 
natural 
philosophy 
in 
the 
continent 
of 
Nature. 
And 
generally 
let 
this 
be 
a 
rule, 
that 
all 
partitions 
of 
knowledges 
be 
accepted 
rather 
for 
lines 
and 
veins 
than 
for 
sections 
and 
separations; 
and 
that 
the 
continuance 
and 
entireness 
of 
knowledge 
be 
preserved. 
For 
the 
contrary 
hereof 
hath 
made 
particular 
sciences 
to 
become 
barren, 
shallow, 
and 
erroneous, 
while 
they 
have 
not 
been 
nourished 
and 
maintained 
from 
the 
common 
fountain. 
So 
we 
see 
Cicero, 
the 
orator, 
complained 
of 
Socrates 
and 
his 
school, 
that 
he 
was 
the 
first 
that 
separated 
philosophy 
and 
rhetoric; 
whereupon 
rhetoric 
became 
an 
empty 
and 
verbal 
art. 
So 
we 
may 
see 
that 
the 
opinion 
of 
Copernicus, 
touching 
the 
rotation 
of 
the 
earth, 
which 
astronomy 
itself 
cannot 
correct, 
because 
it 
is 
not 
repugnant 
to 
any 
of 
the 
phenomena, 
yet 
natural 
philosophy 
may 
correct. 
So 
we 
see 
also 
that 
the 
science 
of 
medicine 
if 
it 
be 
destituted 
and 
forsaken 
by 
natural 
philosophy, 
it 
is 
not 
much 
better 
than 
an 
empirical 
practice. 
With 
this 
reservation, 
therefore, 
we 
proceed 
to 
human 
philosophy 
or 
humanity, 
which 
hath 
two 
parts: 
the 
one 
considereth 
man 
segregate 
or 
distributively, 
the 
other 
congregate 
or 
in 
society; 
so 
as 
human 
philosophy 
is 
either 
simple 
and 
particular, 
or 
conjugate 
and 
civil. 
Humanity 
particular 
consisteth 
of 
the 
same 
parts 
whereof 
man 
consisteth: 
that 
is, 
of 
knowledges 
which 
respect 
the 
body, 
and 
of 
knowledges 
that 
respect 
the 
mind. 
But 
before 
we 
distribute 
so 
far, 
it 
is 
good 
to 
constitute. 
For 
I 
do 
take 
the 
consideration 
in 
general, 
and 
at 
large, 
of 
human 
nature 
to 
be 
fit 
to 
be 
emancipate 
and 
made 
a 
knowledge 
by 
itself, 
not 
so 
much 
in 
regard 
of 
those 
delightful 
and 
elegant 
discourses 
which 
have 
been 
made 
of 
the 
dignity 
of 
man, 
of 
his 
miseries, 
of 
his 
state 
and 
life, 
and 
the 
like 
adjuncts 
of 
his 
common 
and 
undivided 
nature; 
but 
chiefly 
in 
regard 
of 
the 
knowledge 
concerning 
the 
sympathies 
and 
concordances 
between 
the 
mind 
and 
body, 
which 
being 
mixed 
cannot 
be 
properly 
assigned 
to 
the 
sciences 
of 
either. 

(2) 
This 
knowledge 
hath 
two 
branches: 
for 
as 
all 
leagues 
and 
amities 
consist 
of 
mutual 
intelligence 
and 
mutual 
offices, 
so 
this 
league 
of 
mind 
and 
body 
hath 
these 
two 
parts: 
how 
the 
one 
discloseth 
the 
other, 
and 
how 
the 
one 
worketh 
upon 
the 
other; 
discovery 
and 
impression. 
The 
former 
of 
these 
hath 
begotten 
two 
arts, 
both 
of 
prediction 
or 
prenotion; 
whereof 
the 
one 
is 
honoured 
with 
the 
inquiry 
of 
Aristotle, 
and 
the 
other 
of 
Hippocrates. 
And 
although 
they 
have 
of 
later 
time 
been 
used 
to 
be 
coupled 
with 
superstitions 
and 
fantastical 
arts, 
yet 
being 
purged 
and 
restored 
to 
their 
true 
state, 
they 
have 
both 
of 
them 
a 
solid 
ground 
in 
Nature, 
and 
a 
profitable 
use 
in 
life. 
The 
first 
is 
physiognomy, 
which 
discovereth 
the 
disposition 
of 
the 
mind 
by 
the 
lineaments 
of 
the 
body. 
The 
second 
is 
the 
exposition 
of 
natural 
dreams, 
which 
discovereth 
the 
state 
of 
the 
body 
by 
the 
imaginations 
of 
the 
mind. 
In 
the 
former 
of 
these 
I 
note 
a 
deficience. 
For 
Aristotle 
hath 
very 
ingeniously 
and 
diligently 
handled 
the 
factures 
of 
the 
body, 
but 
not 
the 
gestures 
of 
the 
body, 
which 
are 
no 
less 
comprehensible 
by 
art, 
and 
of 
greater 
use 
and 
advantage. 
For 
the 
lineaments 
of 
the 
body 
do 
disclose 
the 
disposition 
and 
inclination 
of 
the 
mind 
in 
general; 
but 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
countenance 
and 
parts 
do 
not 
only 
so, 
but 
do 
further 
disclose 
the 
present 
humour 
and 
state 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
will. 
For 
as 
your 
majesty 
saith 
most 
aptly 
and 
elegantly, 
“As 
the 
tongue 
speaketh 
to 
the 
ear 
so 
the 
gesture 
speaketh 
to 
the 
eye.” 
And, 
therefore, 
a 
number 
of 
subtle 
persons, 
whose 
eyes 
do 
dwell 
upon 
the 
faces 
and 
fashions 
of 
men, 
do 
well 
know 
the 
advantage 
of 
this 
observation, 
as 
being 
most 
part 
of 
their 
ability; 
neither 
can 
it 
be 
denied, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
a 
great 
discovery 
of 
dissimulations, 
and 
a 
great 
direction 
in 
business. 
(3) 
The 
latter 
branch, 
touching 
impression, 
hath 
not 
been 
collected 
into 
art, 
but 
hath 
been 
handled 
dispersedly; 
and 
it 
hath 
the 
same 
relation 
or 
antistrophe 
that 
the 
former 
hath. 
For 
the 
consideration 
is 
double 
— 
either 
how 
and 
how 
far 
the 
humours 
and 
affects 
of 
the 
body 
do 
alter 
or 
work 
upon 
the 
mind, 
or, 
again, 
how 
and 
how 
far 
the 
passions 
or 
apprehensions 
of 
the 
mind 
do 
alter 
or 
work 
upon 
the 
body. 
The 
former 
of 
these 
hath 
been 
inquired 
and 
considered 
as 
a 
part 
and 
appendix 
of 
medicine, 
but 
much 
more 
as 
a 
part 
of 
religion 
or 
superstition. 
For 
the 
physician 
prescribeth 
cures 
of 
the 
mind 
in 
frenzies 
and 
melancholy 
passions, 
and 
pretendeth 
also 
to 
exhibit 
medicines 
to 
exhilarate 
the 
mind, 
to 
control 
the 
courage, 
to 
clarify 
the 
wits, 
to 
corroborate 
the 
memory, 
and 
the 
like; 
but 
the 
scruples 
and 
superstitions 
of 
diet 
and 
other 
regiment 
of 
the 
body 
in 
the 
sect 
of 
the 
Pythagoreans, 
in 
the 
heresy 
of 
the 
Manichees, 
and 
in 
the 
law 
of 
Mahomet, 
do 
exceed. 
So 
likewise 
the 

ordinances 
in 
the 
ceremonial 
law, 
interdicting 
the 
eating 
of 
the 
blood 
and 
the 
fat, 
distinguishing 
between 
beasts 
clean 
and 
unclean 
for 
meat, 
are 
many 
and 
strict; 
nay, 
the 
faith 
itself 
being 
clear 
and 
serene 
from 
all 
clouds 
of 
ceremony, 
yet 
retaineth 
the 
use 
of 
fastlings, 
abstinences, 
and 
other 
macerations 
and 
humiliations 
of 
the 
body, 
as 
things 
real, 
and 
not 
figurative. 
The 
root 
and 
life 
of 
all 
which 
prescripts 
is 
(besides 
the 
ceremony) 
the 
consideration 
of 
that 
dependency 
which 
the 
affections 
of 
the 
mind 
are 
submitted 
unto 
upon 
the 
state 
and 
disposition 
of 
the 
body. 
And 
if 
any 
man 
of 
weak 
judgment 
do 
conceive 
that 
this 
suffering 
of 
the 
mind 
from 
the 
body 
doth 
either 
question 
the 
immortality, 
or 
derogate 
from 
the 
sovereignty 
of 
the 
soul, 
he 
may 
be 
taught, 
in 
easy 
instances, 
that 
the 
infant 
in 
the 
mother’s 
womb 
is 
compatible 
with 
the 
mother, 
and 
yet 
separable; 
and 
the 
most 
absolute 
monarch 
is 
sometimes 
led 
by 
his 
servants, 
and 
yet 
without 
subjection. 
As 
for 
the 
reciprocal 
knowledge, 
which 
is 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
conceits 
and 
passions 
of 
the 
mind 
upon 
the 
body, 
we 
see 
all 
wise 
physicians, 
in 
the 
prescriptions 
of 
their 
regiments 
to 
their 
patients, 
do 
ever 
consider 
accidentia 
animi, 
as 
of 
great 
force 
to 
further 
or 
hinder 
remedies 
or 
recoveries: 
and 
more 
specially 
it 
is 
an 
inquiry 
of 
great 
depth 
and 
worth 
concerning 
imagination, 
how 
and 
how 
far 
it 
altereth 
the 
body 
proper 
of 
the 
imaginant; 
for 
although 
it 
hath 
a 
manifest 
power 
to 
hurt, 
it 
followeth 
not 
it 
hath 
the 
same 
degree 
of 
power 
to 
help. 
No 
more 
than 
a 
man 
can 
conclude, 
that 
because 
there 
be 
pestilent 
airs, 
able 
suddenly 
to 
kill 
a 
man 
in 
health, 
therefore 
there 
should 
be 
sovereign 
airs, 
able 
suddenly 
to 
cure 
a 
man 
in 
sickness. 
But 
the 
inquisition 
of 
this 
part 
is 
of 
great 
use, 
though 
it 
needeth, 
as 
Socrates 
said, 
“a 
Delian 
diver,” 
being 
difficult 
and 
profound. 
But 
unto 
all 
this 
knowledge 
de 
communi 
vinculo, 
of 
the 
concordances 
between 
the 
mind 
and 
the 
body, 
that 
part 
of 
inquiry 
is 
most 
necessary 
which 
considereth 
of 
the 
seats 
and 
domiciles 
which 
the 
several 
faculties 
of 
the 
mind 
do 
take 
and 
occupate 
in 
the 
organs 
of 
the 
body; 
which 
knowledge 
hath 
been 
attempted, 
and 
is 
controverted, 
and 
deserveth 
to 
be 
much 
better 
inquired. 
For 
the 
opinion 
of 
Plato, 
who 
placed 
the 
understanding 
in 
the 
brain, 
animosity 
(which 
he 
did 
unfitly 
call 
anger, 
having 
a 
greater 
mixture 
with 
pride) 
in 
the 
heart, 
and 
concupiscence 
or 
sensuality 
in 
the 
liver, 
deserveth 
not 
to 
be 
despised, 
but 
much 
less 
to 
be 
allowed. 
So, 
then, 
we 
have 
constituted 
(as 
in 
our 
own 
wish 
and 
advice) 
the 
inquiry 
touching 
human 
nature 
entire, 
as 
a 
just 
portion 
of 
knowledge 
to 
be 
handled 
apart. 



 
X 


(1) 
The 
knowledge 
that 
concerneth 
man’s 
body 
is 
divided 
as 
the 
good 
of 
man’s 
body 
is 
divided, 
unto 
which 
it 
referreth. 
The 
good 
of 
man’s 
body 
is 
of 
four 
kinds 
— 
health, 
beauty, 
strength, 
and 
pleasure: 
so 
the 
knowledges 
are 
medicine, 
or 
art 
of 
cure; 
art 
of 
decoration, 
which 
is 
called 
cosmetic; 
art 
of 
activity, 
which 
is 
called 
athletic; 
and 
art 
voluptuary, 
which 
Tacitus 
truly 
calleth 
eruditus 
luxus. 
This 
subject 
of 
man’s 
body 
is, 
of 
all 
other 
things 
in 
nature, 
most 
susceptible 
of 
remedy; 
but 
then 
that 
remedy 
is 
most 
susceptible 
of 
error; 
for 
the 
same 
subtlety 
of 
the 
subject 
doth 
cause 
large 
possibility 
and 
easy 
failing, 
and 
therefore 
the 
inquiry 
ought 
to 
be 
the 
more 
exact. 
(2) 
To 
speak, 
therefore, 
of 
medicine, 
and 
to 
resume 
that 
we 
have 
said, 
ascending 
a 
little 
higher: 
the 
ancient 
opinion 
that 
man 
was 
microcosmus 
— 
an 
abstract 
or 
model 
of 
the 
world 
— 
hath 
been 
fantastically 
strained 
by 
Paracelsus 
and 
the 
alchemists, 
as 
if 
there 
were 
to 
be 
found 
in 
man’s 
body 
certain 
correspondences 
and 
parallels, 
which 
should 
have 
respect 
to 
all 
varieties 
of 
things, 
as 
stars, 
planets, 
minerals, 
which 
are 
extant 
in 
the 
great 
world. 
But 
thus 
much 
is 
evidently 
true, 
that 
of 
all 
substances 
which 
nature 
hath 
produced, 
man’s 
body 
is 
the 
most 
extremely 
compounded. 
For 
we 
see 
herbs 
and 
plants 
are 
nourished 
by 
earth 
and 
water; 
beasts 
for 
the 
most 
part 
by 
herbs 
and 
fruits; 
man 
by 
the 
flesh 
of 
beasts, 
birds, 
fishes, 
herbs, 
grains, 
fruits, 
water, 
and 
the 
manifold 
alterations, 
dressings, 
and 
preparations 
of 
these 
several 
bodies 
before 
they 
come 
to 
be 
his 
food 
and 
aliment. 
Add 
hereunto 
that 
beasts 
have 
a 
more 
simple 
order 
of 
life, 
and 
less 
change 
of 
affections 
to 
work 
upon 
their 
bodies, 
whereas 
man 
in 
his 
mansion, 
sleep, 
exercise, 
passions, 
hath 
infinite 
variations: 
and 
it 
cannot 
be 
denied 
but 
that 
the 
body 
of 
man 
of 
all 
other 
things 
is 
of 
the 
most 
compounded 
mass. 
The 
soul, 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
is 
the 
simplest 
of 
substances, 
as 
is 
well 
expressed:— 
“Purumque 
reliquit 
AEthereum 
sensum 
atque 
aurai 
simplicis 
ignem.” 


So 
that 
it 
is 
no 
marvel 
though 
the 
soul 
so 
placed 
enjoy 
no 
rest, 
if 
that 
principle 
be 
true, 
that 
Motus 
rerum 
est 
rapidus 
extra 
locum, 
placidus 
in 
loco. 



But 
to 
the 
purpose. 
This 
variable 
composition 
of 
man’s 
body 
hath 
made 
it 
as 
an 
instrument 
easy 
to 
distemper; 
and, 
therefore, 
the 
poets 
did 
well 
to 
conjoin 
music 
and 
medicine 
in 
Apollo, 
because 
the 
office 
of 
medicine 
is 
but 
to 
tune 
this 
curious 
harp 
of 
man’s 
body 
and 
to 
reduce 
it 
to 
harmony. 
So, 
then, 
the 
subject 
being 
so 
variable 
hath 
made 
the 
art 
by 
consequent 
more 
conjectural; 
and 
the 
art 
being 
conjectural 
hath 
made 
so 
much 
the 
more 
place 
to 
be 
left 
for 
imposture. 
For 
almost 
all 
other 
arts 
and 
sciences 
are 
judged 
by 
acts 
or 
masterpieces, 
as 
I 
may 
term 
them, 
and 
not 
by 
the 
successes 
and 
events. 
The 
lawyer 
is 
judged 
by 
the 
virtue 
of 
his 
pleading, 
and 
not 
by 
the 
issue 
of 
the 
cause; 
this 
master 
in 
this 
ship 
is 
judged 
by 
the 
directing 
his 
course 
aright, 
and 
not 
by 
the 
fortune 
of 
the 
voyage; 
but 
the 
physician, 
and 
perhaps 
this 
politique, 
hath 
no 
particular 
acts 
demonstrative 
of 
his 
ability, 
but 
is 
judged 
most 
by 
the 
event, 
which 
is 
ever 
but 
as 
it 
is 
taken: 
for 
who 
can 
tell, 
if 
a 
patient 
die 
or 
recover, 
or 
if 
a 
state 
be 
preserved 
or 
ruined, 
whether 
it 
be 
art 
or 
accident? 
And 
therefore 
many 
times 
the 
impostor 
is 
prized, 
and 
the 
man 
of 
virtue 
taxed. 
Nay, 
we 
see 
[the] 
weakness 
and 
credulity 
of 
men 
is 
such, 
as 
they 
will 
often 
refer 
a 
mountebank 
or 
witch 
before 
a 
learned 
physician. 
And 
therefore 
the 
poets 
were 
clear-sighted 
in 
discerning 
this 
extreme 
folly 
when 
they 
made 
AEsculapius 
and 
Circe, 
brother 
and 
sister, 
both 
children 
of 
the 
sun, 
as 
in 
the 
verses 
— 


“Ipse 
repertorem 
medicinae 
talis 
et 
artis 
Fulmine 
Phoebigenam 
Stygias 
detrusit 
ad 
undas.” 


And 
again 
— 


“Dives 
inaccessos 
ubi 
Solis 
filia 
lucos,” 
&c. 


For 
in 
all 
times, 
in 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
multitude, 
witches 
and 
old 
women 
and 
impostors, 
have 
had 
a 
competition 
with 
physicians. 
And 
what 
followeth? 
Even 
this, 
that 
physicians 
say 
to 
themselves, 
as 
Solomon 
expresseth 
it 
upon 
a 
higher 
occasion, 
“If 
it 
befall 
to 
me 
as 
befalleth 
to 
the 
fools, 
why 
should 
I 
labour 
to 
be 
more 
wise?” 
And 
therefore 
I 
cannot 
much 
blame 
physicians 
that 
they 
use 
commonly 
to 
intend 
some 
other 
art 
or 
practice, 
which 
they 
fancy 
more 
than 
their 
profession; 
for 
you 
shall 
have 
of 
them 
antiquaries, 
poets, 
humanists, 
statesmen, 
merchants, 
divines, 
and 
in 
every 
of 
these 
better 
seen 
than 
in 
their 
profession; 
and 
no 
doubt 
upon 
this 
ground 
that 
they 
find 
that 
mediocrity 
and 
excellency 
in 
their 
art 
maketh 
no 
difference 
in 
profit 
or 
reputation 
towards 
their 
fortune: 
for 
the 
weakness 
of 



patients, 
and 
sweetness 
of 
life, 
and 
nature 
of 
hope, 
maketh 
men 
depend 
upon 
physicians 
with 
all 
their 
defects. 
But, 
nevertheless, 
these 
things 
which 
we 
have 
spoken 
of 
are 
courses 
begotten 
between 
a 
little 
occasion 
and 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
sloth 
and 
default; 
for 
if 
we 
will 
excite 
and 
awake 
our 
observation, 
we 
shall 
see 
in 
familiar 
instances 
what 
a 
predominant 
faculty 
the 
subtlety 
of 
spirit 
hath 
over 
the 
variety 
of 
matter 
or 
form. 
Nothing 
more 
variable 
than 
faces 
and 
countenances, 
yet 
men 
can 
bear 
in 
memory 
the 
infinite 
distinctions 
of 
them; 
nay, 
a 
painter, 
with 
a 
few 
shells 
of 
colours, 
and 
the 
benefit 
of 
his 
eye, 
and 
habit 
of 
his 
imagination, 
can 
imitate 
them 
all 
that 
ever 
have 
been, 
are, 
or 
may 
be, 
if 
they 
were 
brought 
before 
him. 
Nothing 
more 
variable 
than 
voices, 
yet 
men 
can 
likewise 
discern 
them 
personally: 
nay, 
you 
shall 
have 
a 
buffon 
or 
pantomimus 
will 
express 
as 
many 
as 
he 
pleaseth. 
Nothing 
more 
variable 
than 
the 
differing 
sounds 
of 
words; 
yet 
men 
have 
found 
the 
way 
to 
reduce 
them 
to 
a 
few 
simple 
letters. 
So 
that 
it 
is 
not 
the 
insufficiency 
or 
incapacity 
of 
man’s 
mind, 
but 
it 
is 
the 
remote 
standing 
or 
placing 
thereof 
that 
breedeth 
these 
mazes 
and 
incomprehensions; 
for 
as 
the 
sense 
afar 
off 
is 
full 
of 
mistaking, 
but 
is 
exact 
at 
hand, 
so 
is 
it 
of 
the 
understanding, 
the 
remedy 
whereof 
is, 
not 
to 
quicken 
or 
strengthen 
the 
organ, 
but 
to 
go 
nearer 
to 
the 
object; 
and 
therefore 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
but 
if 
the 
physicians 
will 
learn 
and 
use 
the 
true 
approaches 
and 
avenues 
of 
nature, 
they 
may 
assume 
as 
much 
as 
the 
poet 
saith:— 


“Et 
quoniam 
variant 
morbi, 
variabimus 
artes; 
Mille 
mali 
species, 
mille 
salutis 
erunt.” 


Which 
that 
they 
should 
do, 
the 
nobleness 
of 
their 
art 
doth 
deserve: 
well 
shadowed 
by 
the 
poets, 
in 
that 
they 
made 
AEsculapius 
to 
be 
the 
son 
of 
[the] 
sun, 
the 
one 
being 
the 
fountain 
of 
life, 
the 
other 
as 
the 
second-stream; 
but 
infinitely 
more 
honoured 
by 
the 
example 
of 
our 
Saviour, 
who 
made 
the 
body 
of 
man 
the 
object 
of 
His 
miracles, 
as 
the 
soul 
was 
the 
object 
of 
His 
doctrine. 
For 
we 
read 
not 
that 
ever 
He 
vouchsafed 
to 
do 
any 
miracle 
about 
honour 
or 
money 
(except 
that 
one 
for 
giving 
tribute 
to 
Caesar), 
but 
only 
about 
the 
preserving, 
sustaining, 
and 
healing 
the 
body 
of 
man. 


(3) 
Medicine 
is 
a 
science 
which 
hath 
been 
(as 
we 
have 
said) 
more 
professed 
than 
laboured, 
and 
yet 
more 
laboured 
than 
advanced; 
the 
labour 
having 
been, 
in 
my 
judgment, 
rather 
in 
circle 
than 
in 
progression. 
For 
I 
find 
much 
iteration, 
but 
small 
addition. 
It 
considereth 
causes 
of 
diseases, 
with 
the 
occasions 
or 
impulsions; 
the 
diseases 
themselves, 
with 
the 
accidents; 
and 
the 

cures, 
with 
the 
preservations. 
The 
deficiences 
which 
I 
think 
good 
to 
note, 
being 
a 
few 
of 
many, 
and 
those 
such 
as 
are 
of 
a 
more 
open 
and 
manifest 
nature, 
I 
will 
enumerate 
and 
not 
place. 


(4) 
The 
first 
is 
the 
discontinuance 
of 
the 
ancient 
and 
serious 
diligence 
of 
Hippocrates, 
which 
used 
to 
set 
down 
a 
narrative 
of 
the 
special 
cases 
of 
his 
patients, 
and 
how 
they 
proceeded, 
and 
how 
they 
were 
judged 
by 
recovery 
or 
death. 
Therefore 
having 
an 
example 
proper 
in 
the 
father 
of 
the 
art, 
I 
shall 
not 
need 
to 
allege 
an 
example 
foreign, 
of 
the 
wisdom 
of 
the 
lawyers, 
who 
are 
careful 
to 
report 
new 
cases 
and 
decisions, 
for 
the 
direction 
of 
future 
judgments. 
This 
continuance 
of 
medicinal 
history 
I 
find 
deficient; 
which 
I 
understand 
neither 
to 
be 
so 
infinite 
as 
to 
extend 
to 
every 
common 
case, 
nor 
so 
reserved 
as 
to 
admit 
none 
but 
wonders: 
for 
many 
things 
are 
new 
in 
this 
manner, 
which 
are 
not 
new 
in 
the 
kind; 
and 
if 
men 
will 
intend 
to 
observe, 
they 
shall 
find 
much 
worthy 
to 
observe. 
(5) 
In 
the 
inquiry 
which 
is 
made 
by 
anatomy, 
I 
find 
much 
deficience: 
for 
they 
inquire 
of 
the 
parts, 
and 
their 
substances, 
figures, 
and 
collocations; 
but 
they 
inquire 
not 
of 
the 
diversities 
of 
the 
parts, 
the 
secrecies 
of 
the 
passages, 
and 
the 
seats 
or 
nestling 
of 
the 
humours, 
nor 
much 
of 
the 
footsteps 
and 
impressions 
of 
diseases. 
The 
reason 
of 
which 
omission 
I 
suppose 
to 
be, 
because 
the 
first 
inquiry 
may 
be 
satisfied 
in 
the 
view 
of 
one 
or 
a 
few 
anatomies; 
but 
the 
latter, 
being 
comparative 
and 
casual, 
must 
arise 
from 
the 
view 
of 
many. 
And 
as 
to 
the 
diversity 
of 
parts, 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
but 
the 
facture 
or 
framing 
of 
the 
inward 
parts 
is 
as 
full 
of 
difference 
as 
the 
outward, 
and 
in 
that 
is 
the 
cause 
continent 
of 
many 
diseases; 
which 
not 
being 
observed, 
they 
quarrel 
many 
times 
with 
the 
humours, 
which 
are 
not 
in 
fault; 
the 
fault 
being 
in 
the 
very 
frame 
and 
mechanic 
of 
the 
part, 
which 
cannot 
be 
removed 
by 
medicine 
alterative, 
but 
must 
be 
accommodated 
and 
palliated 
by 
diets 
and 
medicines 
familiar. 
And 
for 
the 
passages 
and 
pores, 
it 
is 
true 
which 
was 
anciently 
noted, 
that 
the 
more 
subtle 
of 
them 
appear 
not 
in 
anatomies, 
because 
they 
are 
shut 
and 
latent 
in 
dead 
bodies, 
though 
they 
be 
open 
and 
manifest 
in 
life: 
which 
being 
supposed, 
though 
the 
inhumanity 
of 
anatomia 
vivorum 
was 
by 
Celsus 
justly 
reproved; 
yet 
in 
regard 
of 
the 
great 
use 
of 
this 
observation, 
the 
inquiry 
needed 
not 
by 
him 
so 
slightly 
to 
have 
been 
relinquished 
altogether, 
or 
referred 
to 
the 
casual 
practices 
of 
surgery; 
but 
might 
have 
been 
well 
diverted 
upon 
the 
dissection 
of 
beasts 
alive, 
which 
notwithstanding 
the 
dissimilitude 
of 
their 
parts 
may 
sufficiently 
satisfy 
this 

inquiry. 
And 
for 
the 
humours, 
they 
are 
commonly 
passed 
over 
in 
anatomies 
as 
purgaments; 
whereas 
it 
is 
most 
necessary 
to 
observe, 
what 
cavities, 
nests, 
and 
receptacles 
the 
humours 
do 
find 
in 
the 
parts, 
with 
the 
differing 
kind 
of 
the 
humour 
so 
lodged 
and 
received. 
And 
as 
for 
the 
footsteps 
of 
diseases, 
and 
their 
devastations 
of 
the 
inward 
parts, 
impostumations, 
exulcerations, 
discontinuations, 
putrefactions, 
consumptions, 
contractions, 
extensions, 
convulsions, 
dislocations, 
obstructions, 
repletions, 
together 
with 
all 
preternatural 
substances, 
as 
stones, 
carnosities, 
excrescences, 
worms, 
and 
the 
like; 
they 
ought 
to 
have 
been 
exactly 
observed 
by 
multitude 
of 
anatomies, 
and 
the 
contribution 
of 
men’s 
several 
experiences, 
and 
carefully 
set 
down 
both 
historically 
according 
to 
the 
appearances, 
and 
artificially 
with 
a 
reference 
to 
the 
diseases 
and 
symptoms 
which 
resulted 
from 
them, 
in 
case 
where 
the 
anatomy 
is 
of 
a 
defunct 
patient; 
whereas 
now 
upon 
opening 
of 
bodies 
they 
are 
passed 
over 
slightly 
and 
in 
silence. 


(6) 
In 
the 
inquiry 
of 
diseases, 
they 
do 
abandon 
the 
cures 
of 
many, 
some 
as 
in 
their 
nature 
incurable, 
and 
others 
as 
past 
the 
period 
of 
cure; 
so 
that 
Sylla 
and 
the 
Triumvirs 
never 
proscribed 
so 
many 
men 
to 
die, 
as 
they 
do 
by 
their 
ignorant 
edicts: 
whereof 
numbers 
do 
escape 
with 
less 
difficulty 
than 
they 
did 
in 
the 
Roman 
prescriptions. 
Therefore 
I 
will 
not 
doubt 
to 
note 
as 
a 
deficience, 
that 
they 
inquire 
not 
the 
perfect 
cures 
of 
many 
diseases, 
or 
extremities 
of 
diseases; 
but 
pronouncing 
them 
incurable 
do 
enact 
a 
law 
of 
neglect, 
and 
exempt 
ignorance 
from 
discredit. 
(7) 
Nay 
further, 
I 
esteem 
it 
the 
office 
of 
a 
physician 
not 
only 
to 
restore 
health, 
but 
to 
mitigate 
pain 
and 
dolors; 
and 
not 
only 
when 
such 
mitigation 
may 
conduce 
to 
recovery, 
but 
when 
it 
may 
serve 
to 
make 
a 
fair 
and 
easy 
passage. 
For 
it 
is 
no 
small 
felicity 
which 
Augustus 
Caesar 
was 
wont 
to 
wish 
to 
himself, 
that 
same 
Euthanasia; 
and 
which 
was 
specially 
noted 
in 
the 
death 
of 
Antoninus 
Pius, 
whose 
death 
was 
after 
the 
fashion, 
and 
semblance 
of 
a 
kindly 
and 
pleasant 
sheep. 
So 
it 
is 
written 
of 
Epicurus, 
that 
after 
his 
disease 
was 
judged 
desperate, 
he 
drowned 
his 
stomach 
and 
senses 
with 
a 
large 
draught 
and 
ingurgitation 
of 
wine; 
whereupon 
the 
epigram 
was 
made, 
Hinc 
Stygias 
ebrius 
hausit 
aquas; 
he 
was 
not 
sober 
enough 
to 
taste 
any 
bitterness 
of 
the 
Stygian 
water. 
But 
the 
physicians 
contrariwise 
do 
make 
a 
kind 
of 
scruple 
and 
religion 
to 
stay 
with 
the 
patient 
after 
the 
disease 
is 
deplored; 
whereas 
in 
my 
judgment 
they 
ought 
both 
to 
inquire 
the 
skill, 
and 
to 
give 
the 
attendances, 
for 
the 
facilitating 
and 
assuaging 
of 
the 
pains 
and 

agonies 
of 
death. 


(5) 
In 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
cures 
of 
diseases, 
I 
find 
a 
deficience 
in 
the 
receipts 
of 
propriety, 
respecting 
the 
particular 
cures 
of 
diseases: 
for 
the 
physicians 
have 
frustrated 
the 
fruit 
of 
tradition 
and 
experience 
by 
their 
magistralities, 
in 
adding 
and 
taking 
out 
and 
changing 
quid 
pro 
qua 
in 
their 
receipts, 
at 
their 
pleasures; 
commanding 
so 
over 
the 
medicine, 
as 
the 
medicine 
cannot 
command 
over 
the 
disease. 
For 
except 
it 
be 
treacle 
and 
mithridatum, 
and 
of 
late 
diascordium, 
and 
a 
few 
more, 
they 
tie 
themselves 
to 
no 
receipts 
severely 
and 
religiously. 
For 
as 
to 
the 
confections 
of 
sale 
which 
are 
in 
the 
shops, 
they 
are 
for 
readiness 
and 
not 
for 
propriety. 
For 
they 
are 
upon 
general 
intentions 
of 
purging, 
opening, 
comforting, 
altering, 
and 
not 
much 
appropriate 
to 
particular 
diseases. 
And 
this 
is 
the 
cause 
why 
empirics 
and 
old 
women 
are 
more 
happy 
many 
times 
in 
their 
cures 
than 
learned 
physicians, 
because 
they 
are 
more 
religious 
in 
holding 
their 
medicines. 
Therefore 
here 
is 
the 
deficience 
which 
I 
find, 
that 
physicians 
have 
not, 
partly 
out 
of 
their 
own 
practice, 
partly 
out 
of 
the 
constant 
probations 
reported 
in 
books, 
and 
partly 
out 
of 
the 
traditions 
of 
empirics, 
set 
down 
and 
delivered 
over 
certain 
experimental 
medicines 
for 
the 
cure 
of 
particular 
diseases, 
besides 
their 
own 
conjectural 
and 
magistral 
descriptions. 
For 
as 
they 
were 
the 
men 
of 
the 
best 
composition 
in 
the 
state 
of 
Rome, 
which 
either 
being 
consuls 
inclined 
to 
the 
people, 
or 
being 
tribunes 
inclined 
to 
the 
senate; 
so 
in 
the 
matter 
we 
now 
handle, 
they 
be 
the 
best 
physicians, 
which 
being 
learned 
incline 
to 
the 
traditions 
of 
experience, 
or 
being 
empirics 
incline 
to 
the 
methods 
of 
learning. 
(9) 
In 
preparation 
of 
medicines 
I 
do 
find 
strange, 
specially 
considering 
how 
mineral 
medicines 
have 
been 
extolled, 
and 
that 
they 
are 
safer 
for 
the 
outward 
than 
inward 
parts, 
that 
no 
man 
hath 
sought 
to 
make 
an 
imitation 
by 
art 
of 
natural 
baths 
and 
medicinable 
fountains: 
which 
nevertheless 
are 
confessed 
to 
receive 
their 
virtues 
from 
minerals; 
and 
not 
so 
only, 
but 
discerned 
and 
distinguished 
from 
what 
particular 
mineral 
they 
receive 
tincture, 
as 
sulphur, 
vitriol, 
steel, 
or 
the 
like; 
which 
nature, 
if 
it 
may 
be 
reduced 
to 
compositions 
of 
art, 
both 
the 
variety 
of 
them 
will 
be 
increased, 
and 
the 
temper 
of 
them 
will 
be 
more 
commanded. 
(10) 
But 
lest 
I 
grow 
to 
be 
more 
particular 
than 
is 
agreeable 
either 
to 
my 
intention 
or 
to 
proportion, 
I 
will 
conclude 
this 
part 
with 
the 
note 
of 
one 
deficience 
more, 
which 
seemeth 
to 
me 
of 
greatest 
consequence: 
which 
is, 
that 

the 
prescripts 
in 
use 
are 
too 
compendious 
to 
attain 
their 
end; 
for, 
to 
my 
understanding, 
it 
is 
a 
vain 
and 
flattering 
opinion 
to 
think 
any 
medicine 
can 
be 
so 
sovereign 
or 
so 
happy, 
as 
that 
the 
receipt 
or 
miss 
of 
it 
can 
work 
any 
great 
effect 
upon 
the 
body 
of 
man. 
It 
were 
a 
strange 
speech 
which 
spoken, 
or 
spoken 
oft, 
should 
reclaim 
a 
man 
from 
a 
vice 
to 
which 
he 
were 
by 
nature 
subject. 
It 
is 
order, 
pursuit, 
sequence, 
and 
interchange 
of 
application, 
which 
is 
mighty 
in 
nature; 
which 
although 
it 
require 
more 
exact 
knowledge 
in 
prescribing, 
and 
more 
precise 
obedience 
in 
observing, 
yet 
is 
recompensed 
with 
the 
magnitude 
of 
effects. 
And 
although 
a 
man 
would 
think, 
by 
the 
daily 
visitations 
of 
the 
physicians, 
that 
there 
were 
a 
pursuance 
in 
the 
cure, 
yet 
let 
a 
man 
look 
into 
their 
prescripts 
and 
ministrations, 
and 
he 
shall 
find 
them 
but 
inconstancies 
and 
every 
day’s 
devices, 
without 
any 
settled 
providence 
or 
project. 
Not 
that 
every 
scrupulous 
or 
superstitious 
prescript 
is 
effectual, 
no 
more 
than 
every 
straight 
way 
is 
the 
way 
to 
heaven; 
but 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
direction 
must 
precede 
severity 
of 
observance. 


(11) 
For 
cosmetic, 
it 
hath 
parts 
civil, 
and 
parts 
effeminate: 
for 
cleanness 
of 
body 
was 
ever 
esteemed 
to 
proceed 
from 
a 
due 
reverence 
to 
God, 
to 
society, 
and 
to 
ourselves. 
As 
for 
artificial 
decoration, 
it 
is 
well 
worthy 
of 
the 
deficiences 
which 
it 
hath; 
being 
neither 
fine 
enough 
to 
deceive, 
nor 
handsome 
to 
use, 
nor 
wholesome 
to 
please. 
(12) 
For 
athletic, 
I 
take 
the 
subject 
of 
it 
largely, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
for 
any 
point 
of 
ability 
whereunto 
the 
body 
of 
man 
may 
be 
brought, 
whether 
it 
be 
of 
activity, 
or 
of 
patience; 
whereof 
activity 
hath 
two 
parts, 
strength 
and 
swiftness; 
and 
patience 
likewise 
hath 
two 
parts, 
hardness 
against 
wants 
and 
extremities, 
and 
endurance 
of 
pain 
or 
torment; 
whereof 
we 
see 
the 
practices 
in 
tumblers, 
in 
savages, 
and 
in 
those 
that 
suffer 
punishment. 
Nay, 
if 
there 
be 
any 
other 
faculty 
which 
falls 
not 
within 
any 
of 
the 
former 
divisions, 
as 
in 
those 
that 
dive, 
that 
obtain 
a 
strange 
power 
of 
containing 
respiration, 
and 
the 
like, 
I 
refer 
it 
to 
this 
part. 
Of 
these 
things 
the 
practices 
are 
known, 
but 
the 
philosophy 
that 
concerneth 
them 
is 
not 
much 
inquired; 
the 
rather, 
I 
think, 
because 
they 
are 
supposed 
to 
be 
obtained, 
either 
by 
an 
aptness 
of 
nature, 
which 
cannot 
be 
taught, 
or 
only 
by 
continual 
custom, 
which 
is 
soon 
prescribed 
which 
though 
it 
be 
not 
true, 
yet 
I 
forbear 
to 
note 
any 
deficiences; 
for 
the 
Olympian 
games 
are 
down 
long 
since, 
and 
the 
mediocrity 
of 
these 
things 
is 
for 
use; 
as 
for 
the 
excellency 
of 
them 
it 
serveth 
for 
the 
most 
part 
but 
for 
mercenary 
ostentation. 

(13) 
For 
arts 
of 
pleasure 
sensual, 
the 
chief 
deficience 
in 
them 
is 
of 
laws 
to 
repress 
them. 
For 
as 
it 
hath 
been 
well 
observed, 
that 
the 
arts 
which 
flourish 
in 
times 
while 
virtue 
is 
in 
growth, 
are 
military; 
and 
while 
virtue 
is 
in 
state, 
are 
liberal; 
and 
while 
virtue 
is 
in 
declination, 
are 
voluptuary: 
so 
I 
doubt 
that 
this 
age 
of 
the 
world 
is 
somewhat 
upon 
the 
descent 
of 
the 
wheel. 
With 
arts 
voluptuary 
I 
couple 
practices 
joculary; 
for 
the 
deceiving 
of 
the 
senses 
is 
one 
of 
the 
pleasures 
of 
the 
senses. 
As 
for 
games 
of 
recreation, 
I 
hold 
them 
to 
belong 
to 
civil 
life 
and 
education. 
And 
thus 
much 
of 
that 
particular 
human 
philosophy 
which 
concerns 
the 
body, 
which 
is 
but 
the 
tabernacle 
of 
the 
mind. 

XI 


(1) 
For 
human 
knowledge 
which 
concerns 
the 
mind, 
it 
hath 
two 
parts; 
the 
one 
that 
inquireth 
of 
the 
substance 
or 
nature 
of 
the 
soul 
or 
mind, 
the 
other 
that 
inquireth 
of 
the 
faculties 
or 
functions 
thereof. 
Unto 
the 
first 
of 
these, 
the 
considerations 
of 
the 
original 
of 
the 
soul, 
whether 
it 
be 
native 
or 
adventive, 
and 
how 
far 
it 
is 
exempted 
from 
laws 
of 
matter, 
and 
of 
the 
immortality 
thereof, 
and 
many 
other 
points, 
do 
appertain: 
which 
have 
been 
not 
more 
laboriously 
inquired 
than 
variously 
reported; 
so 
as 
the 
travail 
therein 
taken 
seemeth 
to 
have 
been 
rather 
in 
a 
maze 
than 
in 
a 
way. 
But 
although 
I 
am 
of 
opinion 
that 
this 
knowledge 
may 
be 
more 
really 
and 
soundly 
inquired, 
even 
in 
nature, 
than 
it 
hath 
been, 
yet 
I 
hold 
that 
in 
the 
end 
it 
must 
be 
hounded 
by 
religion, 
or 
else 
it 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
deceit 
and 
delusion. 
For 
as 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
soul 
in 
the 
creation 
was 
not 
extracted 
out 
of 
the 
mass 
of 
heaven 
and 
earth 
by 
the 
benediction 
of 
a 
producat, 
but 
was 
immediately 
inspired 
from 
God, 
so 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
that 
it 
should 
be 
(otherwise 
than 
by 
accident) 
subject 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
heaven 
and 
earth, 
which 
are 
the 
subject 
of 
philosophy; 
and 
therefore 
the 
true 
knowledge 
of 
the 
nature 
and 
state 
of 
the 
soul 
must 
come 
by 
the 
same 
inspiration 
that 
gave 
the 
substance. 
Unto 
this 
part 
of 
knowledge 
touching 
the 
soul 
there 
be 
two 
appendices; 
which, 
as 
they 
have 
been 
handled, 
have 
rather 
vapoured 
forth 
fables 
than 
kindled 
truth: 
divination 
and 
fascination. 
(2) 
Divination 
hath 
been 
anciently 
and 
fitly 
divided 
into 
artificial 
and 
natural: 
whereof 
artificial 
is, 
when 
the 
mind 
maketh 
a 
prediction 
by 
argument, 
concluding 
upon 
signs 
and 
tokens; 
natural 
is, 
when 
the 
mind 
hath 
a 
presention 
by 
an 
internal 
power, 
without 
the 
inducement 
of 
a 
sign. 
Artificial 
is 
of 
two 
sorts: 
either 
when 
the 
argument 
is 
coupled 
with 
a 
derivation 
of 
causes, 
which 
is 
rational; 
or 
when 
it 
is 
only 
grounded 
upon 
a 
coincidence 
of 
the 
effect, 
which 
is 
experimental: 
whereof 
the 
latter 
for 
the 
most 
part 
is 
superstitious, 
such 
as 
were 
the 
heathen 
observations 
upon 
the 
inspection 
of 
sacrifices, 
the 
flights 
of 
birds, 
the 
swarming 
of 
bees; 
and 
such 
as 
was 
the 
Chaldean 
astrology, 
and 
the 
like. 
For 
artificial 
divination, 
the 
several 
kinds 
thereof 
are 
distributed 
amongst 
particular 
knowledges. 
The 
astronomer 
hath 
his 
predictions, 
as 
of 
conjunctions, 
aspects, 
eclipses, 
and 
the 
like. 
The 

physician 
hath 
his 
predictions, 
of 
death, 
of 
recovery, 
of 
the 
accidents 
and 
issues 
of 
diseases. 
The 
politique 
hath 
his 
predictions; 
O 
urbem 
venalem, 
et 
cito 
perituram, 
si 
emptorem 
invenerit! 
which 
stayed 
not 
long 
to 
be 
performed, 
in 
Sylla 
first, 
and 
after 
in 
Caesar: 
so 
as 
these 
predictions 
are 
now 
impertinent, 
and 
to 
be 
referred 
over. 
But 
the 
divination 
which 
springeth 
from 
the 
internal 
nature 
of 
the 
soul 
is 
that 
which 
we 
now 
speak 
of; 
which 
hath 
been 
made 
to 
be 
of 
two 
sorts, 
primitive 
and 
by 
influxion. 
Primitive 
is 
grounded 
upon 
the 
supposition 
that 
the 
mind, 
when 
it 
is 
withdrawn 
and 
collected 
into 
itself, 
and 
not 
diffused 
into 
the 
organs 
of 
the 
body, 
hath 
some 
extent 
and 
latitude 
of 
prenotion; 
which 
therefore 
appeareth 
most 
in 
sleep, 
in 
ecstasies, 
and 
near 
death, 
and 
more 
rarely 
in 
waking 
apprehensions; 
and 
is 
induced 
and 
furthered 
by 
those 
abstinences 
and 
observances 
which 
make 
the 
mind 
most 
to 
consist 
in 
itself. 
By 
influxion, 
is 
grounded 
upon 
the 
conceit 
that 
the 
mind, 
as 
a 
mirror 
or 
glass, 
should 
take 
illumination 
from 
the 
foreknowledge 
of 
God 
and 
spirits: 
unto 
which 
the 
same 
regiment 
doth 
likewise 
conduce. 
For 
the 
retiring 
of 
the 
mind 
within 
itself 
is 
the 
state 
which 
is 
most 
susceptible 
of 
divine 
influxions; 
save 
that 
it 
is 
accompanied 
in 
this 
case 
with 
a 
fervency 
and 
elevation 
(which 
the 
ancients 
noted 
by 
fury), 
and 
not 
with 
a 
repose 
and 
quiet, 
as 
it 
is 
in 
the 
other. 


(3) 
Fascination 
is 
the 
power 
and 
act 
of 
imagination 
intensive 
upon 
other 
bodies 
than 
the 
body 
of 
the 
imaginant, 
for 
of 
that 
we 
spake 
in 
the 
proper 
place. 
Wherein 
the 
school 
of 
Paracelsus, 
and 
the 
disciples 
of 
pretended 
natural 
magic, 
have 
been 
so 
intemperate, 
as 
they 
have 
exalted 
the 
power 
of 
the 
imagination 
to 
be 
much 
one 
with 
the 
power 
of 
miracle-working 
faith. 
Others, 
that 
draw 
nearer 
to 
probability, 
calling 
to 
their 
view 
the 
secret 
passages 
of 
things, 
and 
specially 
of 
the 
contagion 
that 
passeth 
from 
body 
to 
body, 
do 
conceive 
it 
should 
likewise 
be 
agreeable 
to 
nature 
that 
there 
should 
be 
some 
transmissions 
and 
operations 
from 
spirit 
to 
spirit 
without 
the 
mediation 
of 
the 
senses; 
whence 
the 
conceits 
have 
grown 
(now 
almost 
made 
civil) 
of 
the 
mastering 
spirit, 
and 
the 
force 
of 
confidence, 
and 
the 
like. 
Incident 
unto 
this 
is 
the 
inquiry 
how 
to 
raise 
and 
fortify 
the 
imagination; 
for 
if 
the 
imagination 
fortified 
have 
power, 
then 
it 
is 
material 
to 
know 
how 
to 
fortify 
and 
exalt 
it. 
And 
herein 
comes 
in 
crookedly 
and 
dangerously 
a 
palliation 
of 
a 
great 
part 
of 
ceremonial 
magic. 
For 
it 
may 
be 
pretended 
that 
ceremonies, 
characters, 
and 
charms 
do 
work, 
not 
by 
any 
tacit 
or 
sacramental 
contract 
with 
evil 
spirits, 
but 
serve 
only 
to 
strengthen 
the 
imagination 
of 
him 
that 
useth 
it; 
as 
images 
are 
said 
by 
the 
Roman 
Church 
to 
fix 
the 
cogitations 

and 
raise 
the 
devotions 
of 
them 
that 
pray 
before 
them. 
But 
for 
mine 
own 
judgment, 
if 
it 
be 
admitted 
that 
imagination 
hath 
power, 
and 
that 
ceremonies 
fortify 
imagination, 
and 
that 
they 
be 
used 
sincerely 
and 
intentionally 
for 
that 
purpose; 
yet 
I 
should 
hold 
them 
unlawful, 
as 
opposing 
to 
that 
first 
edict 
which 
God 
gave 
unto 
man, 
In 
sudore 
vultus 
comedes 
panem 
tuum. 
For 
they 
propound 
those 
noble 
effects, 
which 
God 
hath 
set 
forth 
unto 
man 
to 
be 
bought 
at 
the 
price 
of 
labour, 
to 
be 
attained 
by 
a 
few 
easy 
and 
slothful 
observances. 
Deficiences 
in 
these 
knowledges 
I 
will 
report 
none, 
other 
than 
the 
general 
deficience, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
known 
how 
much 
of 
them 
is 
verity, 
and 
how 
much 
vanity. 



XII 


(1) 
The 
knowledge 
which 
respecteth 
the 
faculties 
of 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
is 
of 
two 
kinds 
— 
the 
one 
respecting 
his 
understanding 
and 
reason, 
and 
the 
other 
his 
will, 
appetite, 
and 
affection; 
whereof 
the 
former 
produceth 
position 
or 
decree, 
the 
latter 
action 
or 
execution. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
imagination 
is 
an 
agent 
or 
nuncius 
in 
both 
provinces, 
both 
the 
judicial 
and 
the 
ministerial. 
For 
sense 
sendeth 
over 
to 
imagination 
before 
reason 
have 
judged, 
and 
reason 
sendeth 
over 
to 
imagination 
before 
the 
decree 
can 
be 
acted. 
For 
imagination 
ever 
precedeth 
voluntary 
motion. 
Saving 
that 
this 
Janus 
of 
imagination 
hath 
differing 
faces: 
for 
the 
face 
towards 
reason 
hath 
the 
print 
of 
truth, 
but 
the 
face 
towards 
action 
hath 
the 
print 
of 
good; 
which 
nevertheless 
are 
faces, 
“Quales 
decet 
esse 
sororum.” 


Neither 
is 
the 
imagination 
simply 
and 
only 
a 
messenger; 
but 
is 
invested 
with, 
or 
at 
least 
wise 
usurpeth 
no 
small 
authority 
in 
itself, 
besides 
the 
duty 
of 
the 
message. 
For 
it 
was 
well 
said 
by 
Aristotle, 
“That 
the 
mind 
hath 
over 
the 
body 
that 
commandment, 
which 
the 
lord 
hath 
over 
a 
bondman; 
but 
that 
reason 
hath 
over 
the 
imagination 
that 
commandment 
which 
a 
magistrate 
hath 
over 
a 
free 
citizen,” 
who 
may 
come 
also 
to 
rule 
in 
his 
turn. 
For 
we 
see 
that, 
in 
matters 
of 
faith 
and 
religion, 
we 
raise 
our 
imagination 
above 
our 
reason, 
which 
is 
the 
cause 
why 
religion 
sought 
ever 
access 
to 
the 
mind 
by 
similitudes, 
types, 
parables, 
visions, 
dreams. 
And 
again, 
in 
all 
persuasions 
that 
are 
wrought 
by 
eloquence, 
and 
other 
impressions 
of 
like 
nature, 
which 
do 
paint 
and 
disguise 
the 
true 
appearance 
of 
things, 
the 
chief 
recommendation 
unto 
reason 
is 
from 
the 
imagination. 
Nevertheless, 
because 
I 
find 
not 
any 
science 
that 
doth 
properly 
or 
fitly 
pertain 
to 
the 
imagination, 
I 
see 
no 
cause 
to 
alter 
the 
former 
division. 
For 
as 
for 
poesy, 
it 
is 
rather 
a 
pleasure 
or 
play 
of 
imagination 
than 
a 
work 
or 
duty 
thereof. 
And 
if 
it 
be 
a 
work, 
we 
speak 
not 
now 
of 
such 
parts 
of 
learning 
as 
the 
imagination 
produceth, 
but 
of 
such 
sciences 
as 
handle 
and 
consider 
of 
the 
imagination. 
No 
more 
than 
we 
shall 
speak 
now 
of 
such 
knowledges 
as 
reason 
produceth 
(for 
that 
extendeth 
to 
all 
philosophy), 
but 
of 
such 
knowledges 
as 
do 
handle 
and 
inquire 
of 
the 
faculty 
of 
reason: 
so 
as 
poesy 
had 
his 
true 
place. 
As 
for 
the 



power 
of 
the 
imagination 
in 
nature, 
and 
the 
manner 
of 
fortifying 
the 
same, 
we 
have 
mentioned 
it 
in 
the 
doctrine 
De 
Anima, 
whereunto 
most 
fitly 
it 
belongeth. 
And 
lastly, 
for 
imaginative 
or 
insinuative 
reason, 
which 
is 
the 
subject 
of 
rhetoric, 
we 
think 
it 
best 
to 
refer 
it 
to 
the 
arts 
of 
reason. 
So 
therefore 
we 
content 
ourselves 
with 
the 
former 
division, 
that 
human 
philosophy, 
which 
respecteth 
the 
faculties 
of 
the 
mind 
of 
man, 
hath 
two 
parts, 
rational 
and 
moral. 


(2) 
The 
part 
of 
human 
philosophy 
which 
is 
rational 
is 
of 
all 
knowledges, 
to 
the 
most 
wits, 
the 
least 
delightful, 
and 
seemeth 
but 
a 
net 
of 
subtlety 
and 
spinosity. 
For 
as 
it 
was 
truly 
said, 
that 
knowledge 
is 
pabulum 
animi; 
so 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
men’s 
appetite 
to 
this 
food 
most 
men 
are 
of 
the 
taste 
and 
stomach 
of 
the 
Israelites 
in 
the 
desert, 
that 
would 
fain 
have 
returned 
ad 
ollas 
carnium, 
and 
were 
weary 
of 
manna; 
which, 
though 
it 
were 
celestial, 
yet 
seemed 
less 
nutritive 
and 
comfortable. 
So 
generally 
men 
taste 
well 
knowledges 
that 
are 
drenched 
in 
flesh 
and 
blood, 
civil 
history, 
morality, 
policy, 
about 
the 
which 
men’s 
affections, 
praises, 
fortunes 
do 
turn 
and 
are 
conversant. 
But 
this 
same 
lumen 
siccum 
doth 
parch 
and 
offend 
most 
men’s 
watery 
and 
soft 
natures. 
But 
to 
speak 
truly 
of 
things 
as 
they 
are 
in 
worth, 
rational 
knowledges 
are 
the 
keys 
of 
all 
other 
arts, 
for 
as 
Aristotle 
saith 
aptly 
and 
elegantly, 
“That 
the 
hand 
is 
the 
instrument 
of 
instruments, 
and 
the 
mind 
is 
the 
form 
of 
forms;” 
so 
these 
be 
truly 
said 
to 
be 
the 
art 
of 
arts. 
Neither 
do 
they 
only 
direct, 
but 
likewise 
confirm 
and 
strengthen; 
even 
as 
the 
habit 
of 
shooting 
doth 
not 
only 
enable 
to 
shoot 
a 
nearer 
shoot, 
but 
also 
to 
draw 
a 
stronger 
bow. 
(3) 
The 
arts 
intellectual 
are 
four 
in 
number, 
divided 
according 
to 
the 
ends 
whereunto 
they 
are 
referred 
— 
for 
man’s 
labour 
is 
to 
invent 
that 
which 
is 
sought 
or 
propounded; 
or 
to 
judge 
that 
which 
is 
invented; 
or 
to 
retain 
that 
which 
is 
judged; 
or 
to 
deliver 
over 
that 
which 
is 
retained. 
So 
as 
the 
arts 
must 
be 
four 
— 
art 
of 
inquiry 
or 
invention; 
art 
of 
examination 
or 
judgment; 
art 
of 
custody 
or 
memory; 
and 
art 
of 
elocution 
or 
tradition. 

XIII 


(1) 
Invention 
is 
of 
two 
kinds 
much 
differing 
— 
the 
one 
of 
arts 
and 
sciences, 
and 
the 
other 
of 
speech 
and 
arguments. 
The 
former 
of 
these 
I 
do 
report 
deficient; 
which 
seemeth 
to 
me 
to 
be 
such 
a 
deficience 
as 
if, 
in 
the 
making 
of 
an 
inventory 
touching 
the 
state 
of 
a 
defunct, 
it 
should 
be 
set 
down 
that 
there 
is 
no 
ready 
money. 
For 
as 
money 
will 
fetch 
all 
other 
commodities, 
so 
this 
knowledge 
is 
that 
which 
should 
purchase 
all 
the 
rest. 
And 
like 
as 
the 
West 
Indies 
had 
never 
been 
discovered 
if 
the 
use 
of 
the 
mariner’s 
needle 
had 
not 
been 
first 
discovered, 
though 
the 
one 
be 
vast 
regions, 
and 
the 
other 
a 
small 
motion; 
so 
it 
cannot 
be 
found 
strange 
if 
sciences 
be 
no 
further 
discovered, 
if 
the 
art 
itself 
of 
invention 
and 
discovery 
hath 
been 
passed 
over. 
(2) 
That 
this 
part 
of 
knowledge 
is 
wanting, 
to 
my 
judgment 
standeth 
plainly 
confessed; 
for 
first, 
logic 
doth 
not 
pretend 
to 
invent 
sciences, 
or 
the 
axioms 
of 
sciences, 
but 
passeth 
it 
over 
with 
a 
cuique 
in 
sua 
arte 
credendum. 
And 
Celsus 
acknowledgeth 
it 
gravely, 
speaking 
of 
the 
empirical 
and 
dogmatical 
sects 
of 
physicians, 
“That 
medicines 
and 
cures 
were 
first 
found 
out, 
and 
then 
after 
the 
reasons 
and 
causes 
were 
discoursed; 
and 
not 
the 
causes 
first 
found 
out, 
and 
by 
light 
from 
them 
the 
medicines 
and 
cures 
discovered.” 
And 
Plato 
in 
his 
“Theaetetus” 
noteth 
well, 
“That 
particulars 
are 
infinite, 
and 
the 
higher 
generalities 
give 
no 
sufficient 
direction; 
and 
that 
the 
pith 
of 
all 
sciences, 
which 
maketh 
the 
artsman 
differ 
from 
the 
inexpert, 
is 
in 
the 
middle 
propositions, 
which 
in 
every 
particular 
knowledge 
are 
taken 
from 
tradition 
and 
experience.” 
And 
therefore 
we 
see, 
that 
they 
which 
discourse 
of 
the 
inventions 
and 
originals 
of 
things 
refer 
them 
rather 
to 
chance 
than 
to 
art, 
and 
rather 
to 
beasts, 
birds, 
fishes, 
serpents, 
than 
to 
men. 
“Dictamnum 
genetrix 
Cretaea 
carpit 
ab 
Ida, 
Puberibus 
caulem 
foliis 
et 
flore 
camantem 
Purpureo; 
non 
illa 
feris 
incognita 
capris 
Gramina, 
cum 
tergo 
volucres 
haesere 
sagittae.” 


So 
that 
it 
was 
no 
marvel 
(the 
manner 
of 
antiquity 
being 
to 
consecrate 
inventors) 
that 
the 
Egyptians 
had 
so 
few 
human 
idols 
in 
their 
temples, 
but 
almost 
all 
brute:— 


“Omnigenumque 
Deum 
monstra, 
et 
latrator 
Anubis, 
Contra 



Neptunum, 
et 
Venerem, 
contraque 
Minervam, 
&c.” 


And 
if 
you 
like 
better 
the 
tradition 
of 
the 
Grecians, 
and 
ascribe 
the 
first 
inventions 
to 
men, 
yet 
you 
will 
rather 
believe 
that 
Prometheus 
first 
stroke 
the 
flints, 
and 
marvelled 
at 
the 
spark, 
than 
that 
when 
he 
first 
stroke 
the 
flints 
he 
expected 
the 
spark; 
and 
therefore 
we 
see 
the 
West 
Indian 
Prometheus 
had 
no 
intelligence 
with 
the 
European, 
because 
of 
the 
rareness 
with 
them 
of 
flint, 
that 
gave 
the 
first 
occasion. 
So 
as 
it 
should 
seem, 
that 
hitherto 
men 
are 
rather 
beholden 
to 
a 
wild 
goat 
for 
surgery, 
or 
to 
a 
nightingale 
for 
music, 
or 
to 
the 
ibis 
for 
some 
part 
of 
physic, 
or 
to 
the 
pot-lid 
that 
flew 
open 
for 
artillery, 
or 
generally 
to 
chance 
or 
anything 
else 
than 
to 
logic 
for 
the 
invention 
of 
arts 
and 
sciences. 
Neither 
is 
the 
form 
of 
invention 
which 
Virgil 
describeth 
much 
other:— 


“Ut 
varias 
usus 
meditande 
extunderet 
artes 
Paulatim.” 


For 
if 
you 
observe 
the 
words 
well, 
it 
is 
no 
other 
method 
than 
that 
which 
brute 
beasts 
are 
capable 
of, 
and 
do 
put 
in 
ure; 
which 
is 
a 
perpetual 
intending 
or 
practising 
some 
one 
thing, 
urged 
and 
imposed 
by 
an 
absolute 
necessity 
of 
conservation 
of 
being. 
For 
so 
Cicero 
saith 
very 
truly, 
Usus 
uni 
rei 
deditus 
et 
naturam 
et 
artem 
saepe 
vincit. 
And 
therefore 
if 
it 
be 
said 
of 
men, 


“Labor 
omnia 
vincit 
Improbus, 
et 
duris 
urgens 
in 
rebus 
egestas,” 


it 
is 
likewise 
said 
of 
beasts, 
Quis 
psittaco 
docuit 
suum 
?a??e? 
Who 
taught 
the 
raven 
in 
a 
drought 
to 
throw 
pebbles 
into 
a 
hollow 
tree, 
where 
she 
spied 
water, 
that 
the 
water 
might 
rise 
so 
as 
she 
might 
come 
to 
it? 
Who 
taught 
the 
bee 
to 
sail 
through 
such 
a 
vast 
sea 
or 
air, 
and 
to 
find 
the 
way 
from 
a 
field 
in 
a 
flower 
a 
great 
way 
off 
to 
her 
hive? 
Who 
taught 
the 
ant 
to 
bite 
every 
grain 
of 
corn 
that 
she 
burieth 
in 
her 
hill, 
lest 
it 
should 
take 
root 
and 
grow? 
Add 
then 
the 
word 
extundere, 
which 
importeth 
the 
extreme 
difficulty, 
and 
the 
word 
paulatim, 
which 
importeth 
the 
extreme 
slowness, 
and 
we 
are 
where 
we 
were, 
even 
amongst 
the 
Egyptians’ 
gods; 
there 
being 
little 
left 
to 
the 
faculty 
of 
reason, 
and 
nothing 
to 
the 
duty 
or 
art, 
for 
matter 
of 
invention. 


(3) 
Secondly, 
the 
induction 
which 
the 
logicians 
speak 
of, 
and 
which 
seemeth 
familiar 
with 
Plato, 
whereby 
the 
principles 
of 
sciences 
may 
be 
pretended 
to 
be 
invented, 
and 
so 
the 
middle 
propositions 
by 
derivation 
from 

the 
principles; 
their 
form 
of 
induction, 
I 
say, 
is 
utterly 
vicious 
and 
incompetent; 
wherein 
their 
error 
is 
the 
fouler, 
because 
it 
is 
the 
duty 
of 
art 
to 
perfect 
and 
exalt 
nature; 
but 
they 
contrariwise 
have 
wronged, 
abused, 
and 
traduced 
nature. 
For 
he 
that 
shall 
attentively 
observe 
how 
the 
mind 
doth 
gather 
this 
excellent 
dew 
of 
knowledge, 
like 
unto 
that 
which 
the 
poet 
speaketh 
of, 
Aerei 
mellis 
caelestia 
dona, 
distilling 
and 
contriving 
it 
out 
of 
particulars 
natural 
and 
artificial, 
as 
the 
flowers 
of 
the 
field 
and 
garden, 
shall 
find 
that 
the 
mind 
of 
herself 
by 
nature 
doth 
manage 
and 
act 
an 
induction 
much 
better 
than 
they 
describe 
it. 
For 
to 
conclude 
upon 
an 
enumeration 
of 
particulars, 
without 
instance 
contradictory, 
is 
no 
conclusion, 
but 
a 
conjecture; 
for 
who 
can 
assure 
(in 
many 
subjects) 
upon 
those 
particulars 
which 
appear 
of 
a 
side, 
that 
there 
are 
not 
other 
on 
the 
contrary 
side 
which 
appear 
not? 
As 
if 
Samuel 
should 
have 
rested 
upon 
those 
sons 
of 
Jesse 
which 
were 
brought 
before 
him, 
and 
failed 
of 
David 
which 
was 
in 
the 
field. 
And 
this 
form 
(to 
say 
truth), 
is 
so 
gross, 
as 
it 
had 
not 
been 
possible 
for 
wits 
so 
subtle 
as 
have 
managed 
these 
things 
to 
have 
offered 
it 
to 
the 
world, 
but 
that 
they 
hasted 
to 
their 
theories 
and 
dogmaticals, 
and 
were 
imperious 
and 
scornful 
toward 
particulars; 
which 
their 
manner 
was 
to 
use 
but 
as 
lictores 
and 
viatores, 
for 
sergeants 
and 
whifflers, 
ad 
summovendam 
turbam, 
to 
make 
way 
and 
make 
room 
for 
their 
opinions, 
rather 
than 
in 
their 
true 
use 
and 
service. 
Certainly 
it 
is 
a 
thing 
may 
touch 
a 
man 
with 
a 
religious 
wonder, 
to 
see 
how 
the 
footsteps 
of 
seducement 
are 
the 
very 
same 
in 
divine 
and 
human 
truth; 
for, 
as 
in 
divine 
truth 
man 
cannot 
endure 
to 
become 
as 
a 
child, 
so 
in 
human, 
they 
reputed 
the 
attending 
the 
inductions 
(whereof 
we 
speak), 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
second 
infancy 
or 
childhood. 


(4) 
Thirdly, 
allow 
some 
principles 
or 
axioms 
were 
rightly 
induced, 
yet, 
nevertheless, 
certain 
it 
is 
that 
middle 
propositions 
cannot 
be 
deduced 
from 
them 
in 
subject 
of 
nature 
by 
syllogism 
— 
that 
is, 
by 
touch 
and 
reduction 
of 
them 
to 
principles 
in 
a 
middle 
term. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
in 
sciences 
popular, 
as 
moralities, 
laws, 
and 
the 
like, 
yea, 
and 
divinity 
(because 
it 
pleaseth 
God 
to 
apply 
Himself 
to 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
simplest), 
that 
form 
may 
have 
use; 
and 
in 
natural 
philosophy 
likewise, 
by 
way 
of 
argument 
or 
satisfactory 
reason, 
Quae 
assensum 
parit 
operis 
effaeta 
est; 
but 
the 
subtlety 
of 
nature 
and 
operations 
will 
not 
be 
enchained 
in 
those 
bonds. 
For 
arguments 
consist 
of 
propositions, 
and 
propositions 
of 
words, 
and 
words 
are 
but 
the 
current 
tokens 
or 
marks 
of 
popular 
notions 
of 
things; 
which 
notions, 
if 
they 
be 
grossly 
and 
variably 
collected 
out 
of 
particulars, 
it 
is 
not 
the 
laborious 
examination 
either 
of 

consequences 
of 
arguments, 
or 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
propositions, 
that 
can 
ever 
correct 
that 
error, 
being 
(as 
the 
physicians 
speak) 
in 
the 
first 
digestion. 
And, 
therefore, 
it 
was 
not 
without 
cause, 
that 
so 
many 
excellent 
philosophers 
became 
sceptics 
and 
academics, 
and 
denied 
any 
certainty 
of 
knowledge 
or 
comprehension; 
and 
held 
opinion 
that 
the 
knowledge 
of 
man 
extended 
only 
to 
appearances 
and 
probabilities. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
in 
Socrates 
it 
was 
supposed 
to 
be 
but 
a 
form 
of 
irony, 
Scientiam 
dissimulando 
simulavit; 
for 
he 
used 
to 
disable 
his 
knowledge, 
to 
the 
end 
to 
enhance 
his 
knowledge; 
like 
the 
humour 
of 
Tiberius 
in 
his 
beginnings, 
that 
would 
reign, 
but 
would 
not 
acknowledge 
so 
much. 
And 
in 
the 
later 
academy, 
which 
Cicero 
embraced, 
this 
opinion 
also 
of 
acatalepsia 
(I 
doubt) 
was 
not 
held 
sincerely; 
for 
that 
all 
those 
which 
excelled 
in 
copy 
of 
speech 
seem 
to 
have 
chosen 
that 
sect, 
as 
that 
which 
was 
fittest 
to 
give 
glory 
to 
their 
eloquence 
and 
variable 
discourses; 
being 
rather 
like 
progresses 
of 
pleasure 
than 
journeys 
to 
an 
end. 
But 
assuredly 
many 
scattered 
in 
both 
academies 
did 
hold 
it 
in 
subtlety 
and 
integrity. 
But 
here 
was 
their 
chief 
error: 
they 
charged 
the 
deceit 
upon 
the 
senses; 
which 
in 
my 
judgment 
(notwithstanding 
all 
their 
cavillations) 
are 
very 
sufficient 
to 
certify 
and 
report 
truth, 
though 
not 
always 
immediately, 
yet 
by 
comparison, 
by 
help 
of 
instrument, 
and 
by 
producing 
and 
urging 
such 
things 
as 
are 
too 
subtle 
for 
the 
sense 
to 
some 
effect 
comprehensible 
by 
the 
sense, 
and 
other 
like 
assistance. 
But 
they 
ought 
to 
have 
charged 
the 
deceit 
upon 
the 
weakness 
of 
the 
intellectual 
powers, 
and 
upon 
the 
manner 
of 
collecting 
and 
concluding 
upon 
the 
reports 
of 
the 
senses. 
This 
I 
speak, 
not 
to 
disable 
the 
mind 
of 
man, 
but 
to 
stir 
it 
up 
to 
seek 
help; 
for 
no 
man, 
be 
he 
never 
so 
cunning 
or 
practised, 
can 
make 
a 
straight 
line 
or 
perfect 
circle 
by 
steadiness 
of 
hand, 
which 
may 
be 
easily 
done 
by 
help 
of 
a 
ruler 
or 
compass. 


(5) 
This 
part 
of 
invention, 
concerning 
the 
invention 
of 
sciences, 
I 
purpose 
(if 
God 
give 
me 
leave) 
hereafter 
to 
propound, 
having 
digested 
it 
into 
two 
parts: 
whereof 
the 
one 
I 
term 
experientia 
literata, 
and 
the 
other 
interpretatio 
naturae; 
the 
former 
being 
but 
a 
degree 
and 
rudiment 
of 
the 
latter. 
But 
I 
will 
not 
dwell 
too 
long, 
nor 
speak 
too 
great 
upon 
a 
promise. 
(6) 
The 
invention 
of 
speech 
or 
argument 
is 
not 
properly 
an 
invention; 
for 
to 
invent 
is 
to 
discover 
that 
we 
know 
not, 
and 
not 
to 
recover 
or 
resummon 
that 
which 
we 
already 
know; 
and 
the 
use 
of 
this 
invention 
is 
no 
other 
but, 
out 
of 
the 
knowledge 
whereof 
our 
mind 
is 
already 
possessed 
to 
draw 
forth 
or 
call 
before 
us 
that 
which 
may 
be 
pertinent 
to 
the 
purpose 
which 

we 
take 
into 
our 
consideration. 
So 
as 
to 
speak 
truly, 
it 
is 
no 
invention, 
but 
a 
remembrance 
or 
suggestion, 
with 
an 
application; 
which 
is 
the 
cause 
why 
the 
schools 
do 
place 
it 
after 
judgment, 
as 
subsequent 
and 
not 
precedent. 
Nevertheless, 
because 
we 
do 
account 
it 
a 
chase 
as 
well 
of 
deer 
in 
an 
enclosed 
park 
as 
in 
a 
forest 
at 
large, 
and 
that 
it 
hath 
already 
obtained 
the 
name, 
let 
it 
be 
called 
invention; 
so 
as 
it 
be 
perceived 
and 
discerned, 
that 
the 
scope 
and 
end 
of 
this 
invention 
is 
readiness 
and 
present 
use 
of 
our 
knowledge, 
and 
not 
addition 
or 
amplification 
thereof. 


(7) 
To 
procure 
this 
ready 
use 
of 
knowledge 
there 
are 
two 
courses, 
preparation 
and 
suggestion. 
The 
former 
of 
these 
seemeth 
scarcely 
a 
part 
of 
knowledge, 
consisting 
rather 
of 
diligence 
than 
of 
any 
artificial 
erudition. 
And 
herein 
Aristotle 
wittily, 
but 
hurtfully, 
doth 
deride 
the 
sophists 
near 
his 
time, 
saying, 
“They 
did 
as 
if 
one 
that 
professed 
the 
art 
of 
shoemaking 
should 
not 
teach 
how 
to 
make 
up 
a 
shoe, 
but 
only 
exhibit 
in 
a 
readiness 
a 
number 
of 
shoes 
of 
all 
fashions 
and 
sizes.” 
But 
yet 
a 
man 
might 
reply, 
that 
if 
a 
shoemaker 
should 
have 
no 
shoes 
in 
his 
shop, 
but 
only 
work 
as 
he 
is 
bespoken, 
he 
should 
be 
weakly 
customed. 
But 
our 
Saviour, 
speaking 
of 
divine 
knowledge, 
saith, 
“That 
the 
kingdom 
of 
heaven 
is 
like 
a 
good 
householder, 
that 
bringeth 
forth 
both 
new 
and 
old 
store;” 
and 
we 
see 
the 
ancient 
writers 
of 
rhetoric 
do 
give 
it 
in 
precept, 
that 
pleaders 
should 
have 
the 
places, 
whereof 
they 
have 
most 
continual 
use, 
ready 
handled 
in 
all 
the 
variety 
that 
may 
be; 
as 
that, 
to 
speak 
for 
the 
literal 
interpretation 
of 
the 
law 
against 
equity, 
and 
contrary; 
and 
to 
speak 
for 
presumptions 
and 
inferences 
against 
testimony, 
and 
contrary. 
And 
Cicero 
himself, 
being 
broken 
unto 
it 
by 
great 
experience, 
delivereth 
it 
plainly, 
that 
whatsoever 
a 
man 
shall 
have 
occasion 
to 
speak 
of 
(if 
he 
will 
take 
the 
pains), 
he 
may 
have 
it 
in 
effect 
premeditate 
and 
handled 
in 
thesi. 
So 
that 
when 
he 
cometh 
to 
a 
particular 
he 
shall 
have 
nothing 
to 
do, 
but 
to 
put 
to 
names, 
and 
times, 
and 
places, 
and 
such 
other 
circumstances 
of 
individuals. 
We 
see 
likewise 
the 
exact 
diligence 
of 
Demosthenes; 
who, 
in 
regard 
of 
the 
great 
force 
that 
the 
entrance 
and 
access 
into 
causes 
hath 
to 
make 
a 
good 
impression, 
had 
ready 
framed 
a 
number 
of 
prefaces 
for 
orations 
and 
speeches. 
All 
which 
authorities 
and 
precedents 
may 
overweigh 
Aristotle’s 
opinion, 
that 
would 
have 
us 
change 
a 
rich 
wardrobe 
for 
a 
pair 
of 
shears. 
(8) 
But 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
collection 
of 
this 
provision 
or 
preparatory 
store, 
though 
it 
be 
common 
both 
to 
logic 
and 
rhetoric, 
yet 
having 
made 
an 

entry 
of 
it 
here, 
where 
it 
came 
first 
to 
be 
spoken 
of, 
I 
think 
fit 
to 
refer 
over 
the 
further 
handling 
of 
it 
to 
rhetoric. 


(9) 
The 
other 
part 
of 
invention, 
which 
I 
term 
suggestion, 
doth 
assign 
and 
direct 
us 
to 
certain 
marks, 
or 
places, 
which 
may 
excite 
our 
mind 
to 
return 
and 
produce 
such 
knowledge 
as 
it 
hath 
formerly 
collected, 
to 
the 
end 
we 
may 
make 
use 
thereof. 
Neither 
is 
this 
use 
(truly 
taken) 
only 
to 
furnish 
argument 
to 
dispute, 
probably 
with 
others, 
but 
likewise 
to 
minister 
unto 
our 
judgment 
to 
conclude 
aright 
within 
ourselves. 
Neither 
may 
these 
places 
serve 
only 
to 
apprompt 
our 
invention, 
but 
also 
to 
direct 
our 
inquiry. 
For 
a 
faculty 
of 
wise 
interrogating 
is 
half 
a 
knowledge. 
For 
as 
Plato 
saith, 
“Whosoever 
seeketh, 
knoweth 
that 
which 
he 
seeketh 
for 
in 
a 
general 
notion; 
else 
how 
shall 
he 
know 
it 
when 
he 
hath 
found 
it?” 
And, 
therefore, 
the 
larger 
your 
anticipation 
is, 
the 
more 
direct 
and 
compendious 
is 
your 
search. 
But 
the 
same 
places 
which 
will 
help 
us 
what 
to 
produce 
of 
that 
which 
we 
know 
already, 
will 
also 
help 
us, 
if 
a 
man 
of 
experience 
were 
before 
us, 
what 
questions 
to 
ask; 
or, 
if 
we 
have 
books 
and 
authors 
to 
instruct 
us, 
what 
points 
to 
search 
and 
revolve; 
so 
as 
I 
cannot 
report 
that 
this 
part 
of 
invention, 
which 
is 
that 
which 
the 
schools 
call 
topics, 
is 
deficient. 
(10) 
Nevertheless, 
topics 
are 
of 
two 
sorts, 
general 
and 
special. 
The 
general 
we 
have 
spoken 
to; 
but 
the 
particular 
hath 
been 
touched 
by 
some, 
but 
rejected 
generally 
as 
inartificial 
and 
variable. 
But 
leaving 
the 
humour 
which 
hath 
reigned 
too 
much 
in 
the 
schools 
(which 
is, 
to 
be 
vainly 
subtle 
in 
a 
few 
things 
which 
are 
within 
their 
command, 
and 
to 
reject 
the 
rest), 
I 
do 
receive 
particular 
topics; 
that 
is, 
places 
or 
directions 
of 
invention 
and 
inquiry 
in 
every 
particular 
knowledge, 
as 
things 
of 
great 
use, 
being 
mixtures 
of 
logic 
with 
the 
matter 
of 
sciences. 
For 
in 
these 
it 
holdeth 
ars 
inveniendi 
adolescit 
cum 
inventis; 
for 
as 
in 
going 
of 
a 
way, 
we 
do 
not 
only 
gain 
that 
part 
of 
the 
way 
which 
is 
passed, 
but 
we 
gain 
the 
better 
sight 
of 
that 
part 
of 
the 
way 
which 
remaineth, 
so 
every 
degree 
of 
proceeding 
in 
a 
science 
giveth 
a 
light 
to 
that 
which 
followeth; 
which 
light, 
if 
we 
strengthen 
by 
drawing 
it 
forth 
into 
questions 
or 
places 
of 
inquiry, 
we 
do 
greatly 
advance 
our 
pursuit. 

XIV 


(1) 
Now 
we 
pass 
unto 
the 
arts 
of 
judgment, 
which 
handle 
the 
natures 
of 
proofs 
and 
demonstrations, 
which 
as 
to 
induction 
hath 
a 
coincidence 
with 
invention; 
for 
all 
inductions, 
whether 
in 
good 
or 
vicious 
form, 
the 
same 
action 
of 
the 
mind 
which 
inventeth, 
judgeth 
— 
all 
one 
as 
in 
the 
sense. 
But 
otherwise 
it 
is 
in 
proof 
by 
syllogism, 
for 
the 
proof 
being 
not 
immediate, 
but 
by 
mean, 
the 
invention 
of 
the 
mean 
is 
one 
thing, 
and 
the 
judgment 
of 
the 
consequence 
is 
another; 
the 
one 
exciting 
only, 
the 
other 
examining. 
Therefore, 
for 
the 
real 
and 
exact 
form 
of 
judgment, 
we 
refer 
ourselves 
to 
that 
which 
we 
have 
spoken 
of 
interpretation 
of 
Nature. 
(2) 
For 
the 
other 
judgment 
by 
syllogism, 
as 
it 
is 
a 
thing 
most 
agreeable 
to 
the 
mind 
of 
man, 
so 
it 
hath 
been 
vehemently 
end 
excellently 
laboured. 
For 
the 
nature 
of 
man 
doth 
extremely 
covet 
to 
have 
somewhat 
in 
his 
understanding 
fixed 
and 
unmovable, 
and 
as 
a 
rest 
and 
support 
of 
the 
mind. 
And, 
therefore, 
as 
Aristotle 
endeavoureth 
to 
prove, 
that 
in 
all 
motion 
there 
is 
some 
point 
quiescent; 
and 
as 
he 
elegantly 
expoundeth 
the 
ancient 
fable 
of 
Atlas 
(that 
stood 
fixed, 
and 
bare 
up 
the 
heaven 
from 
falling) 
to 
be 
meant 
of 
the 
poles 
or 
axle-tree 
of 
heaven, 
whereupon 
the 
conversion 
is 
accomplished, 
so 
assuredly 
men 
have 
a 
desire 
to 
have 
an 
Atlas 
or 
axle-tree 
within 
to 
keep 
them 
from 
fluctuation, 
which 
is 
like 
to 
a 
perpetual 
peril 
of 
falling. 
Therefore 
men 
did 
hasten 
to 
set 
down 
some 
principles 
about 
which 
the 
variety 
of 
their 
disputatious 
might 
turn. 
(3) 
So, 
then, 
this 
art 
of 
judgment 
is 
but 
the 
reduction 
of 
propositions 
to 
principles 
in 
a 
middle 
term. 
The 
principles 
to 
be 
agreed 
by 
all 
and 
exempted 
from 
argument; 
the 
middle 
term 
to 
be 
elected 
at 
the 
liberty 
of 
every 
man’s 
invention; 
the 
reduction 
to 
be 
of 
two 
kinds, 
direct 
and 
inverted: 
the 
one 
when 
the 
proposition 
is 
reduced 
to 
the 
principle, 
which 
they 
term 
a 
probation 
ostensive; 
the 
other, 
when 
the 
contradictory 
of 
the 
proposition 
is 
reduced 
to 
the 
contradictory 
of 
the 
principle, 
which 
is 
that 
which 
they 
call 
per 
incommodum, 
or 
pressing 
an 
absurdity; 
the 
number 
of 
middle 
terms 
to 
be 
as 
the 
proposition 
standeth 
degrees 
more 
or 
less 
removed 
from 
the 
principle. 
(4) 
But 
this 
art 
hath 
two 
several 
methods 
of 
doctrine, 
the 
one 
by 
way 

of 
direction, 
the 
other 
by 
way 
of 
caution: 
the 
former 
frameth 
and 
setteth 
down 
a 
true 
form 
of 
consequence, 
by 
the 
variations 
and 
deflections 
from 
which 
errors 
and 
inconsequences 
may 
be 
exactly 
judged. 
Toward 
the 
composition 
and 
structure 
of 
which 
form 
it 
is 
incident 
to 
handle 
the 
parts 
thereof, 
which 
are 
propositions, 
and 
the 
parts 
of 
propositions, 
which 
are 
simple 
words. 
And 
this 
is 
that 
part 
of 
logic 
which 
is 
comprehended 
in 
the 
Analytics. 


(5) 
The 
second 
method 
of 
doctrine 
was 
introduced 
for 
expedite 
use 
and 
assurance 
sake, 
discovering 
the 
more 
subtle 
forms 
of 
sophisms 
and 
illaqueations 
with 
their 
redargutions, 
which 
is 
that 
which 
is 
termed 
elenches. 
For 
although 
in 
the 
more 
gross 
sorts 
of 
fallacies 
it 
happeneth 
(as 
Seneca 
maketh 
the 
comparison 
well) 
as 
in 
juggling 
feats, 
which, 
though 
we 
know 
not 
how 
they 
are 
done, 
yet 
we 
know 
well 
it 
is 
not 
as 
it 
seemeth 
to 
be; 
yet 
the 
more 
subtle 
sort 
of 
them 
doth 
not 
only 
put 
a 
man 
besides 
his 
answer, 
but 
doth 
many 
times 
abuse 
his 
judgment. 
(6) 
This 
part 
concerning 
elenches 
is 
excellently 
handled 
by 
Aristotle 
in 
precept, 
but 
more 
excellently 
by 
Plato 
in 
example; 
not 
only 
in 
the 
persons 
of 
the 
sophists, 
but 
even 
in 
Socrates 
himself, 
who, 
professing 
to 
affirm 
nothing, 
but 
to 
infirm 
that 
which 
was 
affirmed 
by 
another, 
hath 
exactly 
expressed 
all 
the 
forms 
of 
objection, 
fallace, 
and 
redargution. 
And 
although 
we 
have 
said 
that 
the 
use 
of 
this 
doctrine 
is 
for 
redargution, 
yet 
it 
is 
manifest 
the 
degenerate 
and 
corrupt 
use 
is 
for 
caption 
and 
contradiction, 
which 
passeth 
for 
a 
great 
faculty, 
and 
no 
doubt 
is 
of 
very 
great 
advantage, 
though 
the 
difference 
be 
good 
which 
was 
made 
between 
orators 
and 
sophisters, 
that 
the 
one 
is 
as 
the 
greyhound, 
which 
hath 
his 
advantage 
in 
the 
race, 
and 
the 
other 
as 
the 
hare, 
which 
hath 
her 
advantage 
in 
the 
turn, 
so 
as 
it 
is 
the 
advantage 
of 
the 
weaker 
creature. 
(7) 
But 
yet 
further, 
this 
doctrine 
of 
elenches 
hath 
a 
more 
ample 
latitude 
and 
extent 
than 
is 
perceived; 
namely, 
unto 
divers 
parts 
of 
knowledge, 
whereof 
some 
are 
laboured 
and 
other 
omitted. 
For 
first, 
I 
conceive 
(though 
it 
may 
seem 
at 
first 
somewhat 
strange) 
that 
that 
part 
which 
is 
variably 
referred, 
sometimes 
to 
logic, 
sometimes 
to 
metaphysic, 
touching 
the 
common 
adjuncts 
of 
essences, 
is 
but 
an 
elenche; 
for 
the 
great 
sophism 
of 
all 
sophisms 
being 
equivocation 
or 
ambiguity 
of 
words 
and 
phrase, 
specially 
of 
such 
words 
as 
are 
most 
general 
and 
intervene 
in 
every 
inquiry, 
it 
seemeth 
to 
me 
that 
the 
true 
and 
fruitful 
use 
(leaving 
vain 
subtleties 
and 
speculations) 
of 
the 
inquiry 
of 

majority, 
minority, 
priority, 
posteriority, 
identity, 
diversity, 
possibility, 
act, 
totality, 
parts, 
existence, 
privation, 
and 
the 
like, 
are 
but 
wise 
cautions 
against 
ambiguities 
of 
speech. 
So, 
again, 
the 
distribution 
of 
things 
into 
certain 
tribes, 
which 
we 
call 
categories 
or 
predicaments, 
are 
but 
cautions 
against 
the 
confusion 
of 
definitions 
and 
divisions. 


(8) 
Secondly, 
there 
is 
a 
seducement 
that 
worketh 
by 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
impression, 
and 
not 
by 
the 
subtlety 
of 
the 
illaqueation 
— 
not 
so 
much 
perplexing 
the 
reason, 
as 
overruling 
it 
by 
power 
of 
the 
imagination. 
But 
this 
part 
I 
think 
more 
proper 
to 
handle 
when 
I 
shall 
speak 
of 
rhetoric. 
(9) 
But 
lastly, 
there 
is 
yet 
a 
much 
more 
important 
and 
profound 
kind 
of 
fallacies 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
man, 
which 
I 
find 
not 
observed 
or 
inquired 
at 
all, 
and 
think 
good 
to 
place 
here, 
as 
that 
which 
of 
all 
others 
appertaineth 
most 
to 
rectify 
judgment, 
the 
force 
whereof 
is 
such 
as 
it 
doth 
not 
dazzle 
or 
snare 
the 
understanding 
in 
some 
particulars, 
but 
doth 
more 
generally 
and 
inwardly 
infect 
and 
corrupt 
the 
state 
thereof. 
For 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
is 
far 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
clear 
and 
equal 
glass, 
wherein 
the 
beams 
of 
things 
should 
reflect 
according 
to 
their 
true 
incidence; 
nay, 
it 
is 
rather 
like 
an 
enchanted 
glass, 
full 
of 
superstition 
and 
imposture, 
if 
it 
be 
not 
delivered 
and 
reduced. 
For 
this 
purpose, 
let 
us 
consider 
the 
false 
appearances 
that 
are 
imposed 
upon 
us 
by 
the 
general 
nature 
of 
the 
mind, 
beholding 
them 
in 
an 
example 
or 
two; 
as 
first, 
in 
that 
instance 
which 
is 
the 
root 
of 
all 
superstition, 
namely, 
that 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
mind 
of 
all 
men 
it 
is 
consonant 
for 
the 
affirmative 
or 
active 
to 
affect 
more 
than 
the 
negative 
or 
privative. 
So 
that 
a 
few 
times 
hitting 
or 
presence 
countervails 
ofttimes 
failing 
or 
absence, 
as 
was 
well 
answered 
by 
Diagoras 
to 
him 
that 
showed 
him 
in 
Neptune’s 
temple 
the 
great 
number 
of 
pictures 
of 
such 
as 
had 
escaped 
shipwreck, 
and 
had 
paid 
their 
vows 
to 
Neptune, 
saying, 
“Advise 
now, 
you 
that 
think 
it 
folly 
to 
invocate 
Neptune 
in 
tempest.” 
“Yea, 
but,” 
saith 
Diagoras, 
“where 
are 
they 
painted 
that 
are 
drowned?” 
Let 
us 
behold 
it 
in 
another 
instance, 
namely, 
that 
the 
spirit 
of 
man, 
being 
of 
an 
equal 
and 
uniform 
substance, 
doth 
usually 
suppose 
and 
feign 
in 
nature 
a 
greater 
equality 
and 
uniformity 
than 
is 
in 
truth. 
Hence 
it 
cometh 
that 
the 
mathematicians 
cannot 
satisfy 
themselves 
except 
they 
reduce 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
celestial 
bodies 
to 
perfect 
circles, 
rejecting 
spiral 
lines, 
and 
labouring 
to 
be 
discharged 
of 
eccentrics. 
Hence 
it 
cometh 
that 
whereas 
there 
are 
many 
things 
in 
Nature 
as 
it 
were 
monodica, 
sui 
juris, 
yet 
the 
cogitations 
of 
man 
do 
feign 
unto 
them 
relatives, 
parallels, 
and 
conjugates, 
whereas 
no 
such 
thing 
is; 

as 
they 
have 
feigned 
an 
element 
of 
fire 
to 
keep 
square 
with 
earth, 
water, 
and 
air, 
and 
the 
like. 
Nay, 
it 
is 
not 
credible, 
till 
it 
be 
opened, 
what 
a 
number 
of 
fictions 
and 
fantasies 
the 
similitude 
of 
human 
actions 
and 
arts, 
together 
with 
the 
making 
of 
man 
communis 
mensura, 
have 
brought 
into 
natural 
philosophy; 
not 
much 
better 
than 
the 
heresy 
of 
the 
Anthropomorphites, 
bred 
in 
the 
cells 
of 
gross 
and 
solitary 
monks, 
and 
the 
opinion 
of 
Epicurus, 
answerable 
to 
the 
same 
in 
heathenism, 
who 
supposed 
the 
gods 
to 
be 
of 
human 
shape. 
And, 
therefore, 
Velleius 
the 
Epicurean 
needed 
not 
to 
have 
asked 
why 
God 
should 
have 
adorned 
the 
heavens 
with 
stars, 
as 
if 
He 
had 
been 
an 
aedilis, 
one 
that 
should 
have 
set 
forth 
some 
magnificent 
shows 
or 
plays. 
For 
if 
that 
great 
Work-master 
had 
been 
of 
a 
human 
disposition, 
He 
would 
have 
cast 
the 
stars 
into 
some 
pleasant 
and 
beautiful 
works 
and 
orders 
like 
the 
frets 
in 
the 
roofs 
of 
houses; 
whereas 
one 
can 
scarce 
find 
a 
posture 
in 
square, 
or 
triangle, 
or 
straight 
line, 
amongst 
such 
an 
infinite 
number, 
so 
differing 
a 
harmony 
there 
is 
between 
the 
spirit 
of 
man 
and 
the 
spirit 
of 
Nature. 


(10) 
Let 
us 
consider 
again 
the 
false 
appearances 
imposed 
upon 
us 
by 
every 
man’s 
own 
individual 
nature 
and 
custom 
in 
that 
feigned 
supposition 
that 
Plato 
maketh 
of 
the 
cave; 
for 
certainly 
if 
a 
child 
were 
continued 
in 
a 
grot 
or 
cave 
under 
the 
earth 
until 
maturity 
of 
age, 
and 
came 
suddenly 
abroad, 
he 
would 
have 
strange 
and 
absurd 
imaginations. 
So, 
in 
like 
manner, 
although 
our 
persons 
live 
in 
the 
view 
of 
heaven, 
yet 
our 
spirits 
are 
included 
in 
the 
caves 
of 
our 
own 
complexions 
and 
customs, 
which 
minister 
unto 
us 
infinite 
errors 
and 
vain 
opinions 
if 
they 
be 
not 
recalled 
to 
examination. 
But 
hereof 
we 
have 
given 
many 
examples 
in 
one 
of 
the 
errors, 
or 
peccant 
humours, 
which 
we 
ran 
briefly 
over 
in 
our 
first 
book. 
(11) 
And 
lastly, 
let 
us 
consider 
the 
false 
appearances 
that 
are 
imposed 
upon 
us 
by 
words, 
which 
are 
framed 
and 
applied 
according 
to 
the 
conceit 
and 
capacities 
of 
the 
vulgar 
sort; 
and 
although 
we 
think 
we 
govern 
our 
words, 
and 
prescribe 
it 
well 
loquendum 
ut 
vulgus 
sentiendum 
ut 
sapientes, 
yet 
certain 
it 
is 
that 
words, 
as 
a 
Tartar’s 
bow, 
do 
shoot 
back 
upon 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
wisest, 
and 
mightily 
entangle 
and 
pervert 
the 
judgment. 
So 
as 
it 
is 
almost 
necessary 
in 
all 
controversies 
and 
disputations 
to 
imitate 
the 
wisdom 
of 
the 
mathematicians, 
in 
setting 
down 
in 
the 
very 
beginning 
the 
definitions 
of 
our 
words 
and 
terms, 
that 
others 
may 
know 
how 
we 
accept 
and 
understand 
them, 
and 
whether 
they 
concur 
with 
us 
or 
no. 
For 
it 
cometh 
to 
pass, 
for 
want 
of 
this, 
that 
we 
are 
sure 
to 
end 
there 
where 
we 
ought 

to 
have 
begun, 
which 
is, 
in 
questions 
and 
differences 
about 
words. 
To 
conclude, 
therefore, 
it 
must 
be 
confessed 
that 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
divorce 
ourselves 
from 
these 
fallacies 
and 
false 
appearances 
because 
they 
are 
inseparable 
from 
our 
nature 
and 
condition 
of 
life; 
so 
yet, 
nevertheless, 
the 
caution 
of 
them 
(for 
all 
elenches, 
as 
was 
said, 
are 
but 
cautions) 
doth 
extremely 
import 
the 
true 
conduct 
of 
human 
judgment. 
The 
particular 
elenches 
or 
cautions 
against 
these 
three 
false 
appearances 
I 
find 
altogether 
deficient. 


(12) 
There 
remaineth 
one 
part 
of 
judgment 
of 
great 
excellency 
which 
to 
mine 
understanding 
is 
so 
slightly 
touched, 
as 
I 
may 
report 
that 
also 
deficient; 
which 
is 
the 
application 
of 
the 
differing 
kinds 
of 
proofs 
to 
the 
differing 
kinds 
of 
subjects. 
For 
there 
being 
but 
four 
kinds 
of 
demonstrations, 
that 
is, 
by 
the 
immediate 
consent 
of 
the 
mind 
or 
sense, 
by 
induction, 
by 
syllogism, 
and 
by 
congruity, 
which 
is 
that 
which 
Aristotle 
calleth 
demonstration 
in 
orb 
or 
circle, 
and 
not 
a 
notioribus, 
every 
of 
these 
hath 
certain 
subjects 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
sciences, 
in 
which 
respectively 
they 
have 
chiefest 
use; 
and 
certain 
others, 
from 
which 
respectively 
they 
ought 
to 
be 
excluded; 
and 
the 
rigour 
and 
curiosity 
in 
requiring 
the 
more 
severe 
proofs 
in 
some 
things, 
and 
chiefly 
the 
facility 
in 
contenting 
ourselves 
with 
the 
more 
remiss 
proofs 
in 
others, 
hath 
been 
amongst 
the 
greatest 
causes 
of 
detriment 
and 
hindrance 
to 
knowledge. 
The 
distributions 
and 
assignations 
of 
demonstrations 
according 
to 
the 
analogy 
of 
sciences 
I 
note 
as 
deficient. 

XV 


(1) 
The 
custody 
or 
retaining 
of 
knowledge 
is 
either 
in 
writing 
or 
memory; 
whereof 
writing 
hath 
two 
parts, 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
character 
and 
the 
order 
of 
the 
entry. 
For 
the 
art 
of 
characters, 
or 
other 
visible 
notes 
of 
words 
or 
things, 
it 
hath 
nearest 
conjugation 
with 
grammar, 
and, 
therefore, 
I 
refer 
it 
to 
the 
due 
place; 
for 
the 
disposition 
and 
collocation 
of 
that 
knowledge 
which 
we 
preserve 
in 
writing, 
it 
consisteth 
in 
a 
good 
digest 
of 
common-places, 
wherein 
I 
am 
not 
ignorant 
of 
the 
prejudice 
imputed 
to 
the 
use 
of 
common-place 
books, 
as 
causing 
a 
retardation 
of 
reading, 
and 
some 
sloth 
or 
relaxation 
of 
memory. 
But 
because 
it 
is 
but 
a 
counterfeit 
thing 
in 
knowledges 
to 
be 
forward 
and 
pregnant, 
except 
a 
man 
be 
deep 
and 
full, 
I 
hold 
the 
entry 
of 
common-places 
to 
be 
a 
matter 
of 
great 
use 
and 
essence 
in 
studying, 
as 
that 
which 
assureth 
copy 
of 
invention, 
and 
contracteth 
judgment 
to 
a 
strength. 
But 
this 
is 
true, 
that 
of 
the 
methods 
of 
common-places 
that 
I 
have 
seen, 
there 
is 
none 
of 
any 
sufficient 
worth, 
all 
of 
them 
carrying 
merely 
the 
face 
of 
a 
school 
and 
not 
of 
a 
world; 
and 
referring 
to 
vulgar 
matters 
and 
pedantical 
divisions, 
without 
all 
life 
or 
respect 
to 
action. 
(2) 
For 
the 
other 
principal 
part 
of 
the 
custody 
of 
knowledge, 
which 
is 
memory, 
I 
find 
that 
faculty 
in 
my 
judgment 
weakly 
inquired 
of. 
An 
art 
there 
is 
extant 
of 
it; 
but 
it 
seemeth 
to 
me 
that 
there 
are 
better 
precepts 
than 
that 
art, 
and 
better 
practices 
of 
that 
art 
than 
those 
received. 
It 
is 
certain 
the 
art 
(as 
it 
is) 
may 
be 
raised 
to 
points 
of 
ostentation 
prodigious; 
but 
in 
use 
(as 
is 
now 
managed) 
it 
is 
barren, 
not 
burdensome, 
nor 
dangerous 
to 
natural 
memory, 
as 
is 
imagined, 
but 
barren, 
that 
is, 
not 
dexterous 
to 
be 
applied 
to 
the 
serious 
use 
of 
business 
and 
occasions. 
And, 
therefore, 
I 
make 
no 
more 
estimation 
of 
repeating 
a 
great 
number 
of 
names 
or 
words 
upon 
once 
hearing, 
or 
the 
pouring 
forth 
of 
a 
number 
of 
verses 
or 
rhymes 
extempore, 
or 
the 
making 
of 
a 
satirical 
simile 
of 
everything, 
or 
the 
turning 
of 
everything 
to 
a 
jest, 
or 
the 
falsifying 
or 
contradicting 
of 
everything 
by 
cavil, 
or 
the 
like 
(whereof 
in 
the 
faculties 
of 
the 
mind 
there 
is 
great 
copy, 
and 
such 
as 
by 
device 
and 
practice 
may 
be 
exalted 
to 
an 
extreme 
degree 
of 
wonder), 
than 
I 
do 
of 
the 
tricks 
of 
tumblers, 
funambuloes, 
baladines; 
the 
one 
being 
the 
same 
in 
the 
mind 
that 
the 
other 
is 
in 
the 
body, 
matters 
of 
strangeness 
without 
worthiness. 

(3) 
This 
art 
of 
memory 
is 
but 
built 
upon 
two 
intentions; 
the 
one 
prenotion, 
the 
other 
emblem. 
Prenotion 
dischargeth 
the 
indefinite 
seeking 
of 
that 
we 
would 
remember, 
and 
directeth 
us 
to 
seek 
in 
a 
narrow 
compass, 
that 
is, 
somewhat 
that 
hath 
congruity 
with 
our 
place 
of 
memory. 
Emblem 
reduceth 
conceits 
intellectual 
to 
images 
sensible, 
which 
strike 
the 
memory 
more; 
out 
of 
which 
axioms 
may 
be 
drawn 
much 
better 
practice 
than 
that 
in 
use; 
and 
besides 
which 
axioms, 
there 
are 
divers 
more 
touching 
help 
of 
memory 
not 
inferior 
to 
them. 
But 
I 
did 
in 
the 
beginning 
distinguish, 
not 
to 
report 
those 
things 
deficient, 
which 
are 
but 
only 
ill 
managed. 
XVI 


(1) 
There 
remaineth 
the 
fourth 
kind 
of 
rational 
knowledge, 
which 
is 
transitive, 
concerning 
the 
expressing 
or 
transferring 
our 
knowledge 
to 
others, 
which 
I 
will 
term 
by 
the 
general 
name 
of 
tradition 
or 
delivery. 
Tradition 
hath 
three 
parts: 
the 
first 
concerning 
the 
organ 
of 
tradition; 
the 
second 
concerning 
the 
method 
of 
tradition; 
and 
the 
third 
concerning 
the 
illustration 
of 
tradition. 
(2) 
For 
the 
organ 
of 
tradition, 
it 
is 
either 
speech 
or 
writing; 
for 
Aristotle 
saith 
well, 
“Words 
are 
the 
images 
of 
cogitations, 
and 
letters 
are 
the 
images 
of 
words.” 
But 
yet 
it 
is 
not 
of 
necessity 
that 
cogitations 
be 
expressed 
by 
the 
medium 
of 
words. 
For 
whatsoever 
is 
capable 
of 
sufficient 
differences, 
and 
those 
perceptible 
by 
the 
sense, 
is 
in 
nature 
competent 
to 
express 
cogitations. 
And, 
therefore, 
we 
see 
in 
the 
commerce 
of 
barbarous 
people 
that 
understand 
not 
one 
another’s 
language, 
and 
in 
the 
practice 
of 
divers 
that 
are 
dumb 
and 
deaf, 
that 
men’s 
minds 
are 
expressed 
in 
gestures, 
though 
not 
exactly, 
yet 
to 
serve 
the 
turn. 
And 
we 
understand 
further, 
that 
it 
is 
the 
use 
of 
China 
and 
the 
kingdoms 
of 
the 
High 
Levant 
to 
write 
in 
characters 
real, 
which 
express 
neither 
letters 
nor 
words 
in 
gross, 
but 
things 
or 
notions; 
insomuch 
as 
countries 
and 
provinces 
which 
understand 
not 
one 
another’s 
language 
can 
nevertheless 
read 
one 
another’s 
writings, 
because 
the 
characters 
are 
accepted 
more 
generally 
than 
the 
languages 
do 
extend; 
and, 
therefore, 
they 
have 
a 
vast 
multitude 
of 
characters, 
as 
many, 
I 
suppose, 
as 
radical 
words. 

(3) 
These 
notes 
of 
cogitations 
are 
of 
two 
sorts: 
the 
one 
when 
the 
note 
hath 
some 
similitude 
or 
congruity 
with 
the 
notion; 
the 
other 
ad 
placitum, 
having 
force 
only 
by 
contract 
or 
acceptation. 
Of 
the 
former 
sort 
are 
hieroglyphics 
and 
gestures. 
For 
as 
to 
hieroglyphics 
(things 
of 
ancient 
use 
and 
embraced 
chiefly 
by 
the 
Egyptians, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
ancient 
nations), 
they 
are 
but 
as 
continued 
impresses 
and 
emblems. 
And 
as 
for 
gestures, 
they 
are 
as 
transitory 
hieroglyphics, 
and 
are 
to 
hieroglyphics 
as 
words 
spoken 
are 
to 
words 
written, 
in 
that 
they 
abide 
not; 
but 
they 
have 
evermore, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
other, 
an 
affinity 
with 
the 
things 
signified. 
As 
Periander, 
being 
consulted 
with 
how 
to 
preserve 
a 
tyranny 
newly 
usurped, 
bid 
the 
messenger 
attend 
and 
report 
what 
he 
saw 
him 
do; 
and 
went 
into 
his 
garden 
and 
topped 
all 
the 
highest 
flowers, 
signifying 
that 
it 
consisted 
in 
the 
cutting 
off 
and 
keeping 
low 
of 
the 
nobility 
and 
grandees. 
Ad 
placitum, 
are 
the 
characters 
real 
before 
mentioned, 
and 
words: 
although 
some 
have 
been 
willing 
by 
curious 
inquiry, 
or 
rather 
by 
apt 
feigning, 
to 
have 
derived 
imposition 
of 
names 
from 
reason 
and 
intendment; 
a 
speculation 
elegant, 
and, 
by 
reason 
it 
searcheth 
into 
antiquity, 
reverent, 
but 
sparingly 
mixed 
with 
truth, 
and 
of 
small 
fruit. 
This 
portion 
of 
knowledge 
touching 
the 
notes 
of 
things 
and 
cogitations 
in 
general, 
I 
find 
not 
inquired, 
but 
deficient. 
And 
although 
it 
may 
seem 
of 
no 
great 
use, 
considering 
that 
words 
and 
writings 
by 
letters 
do 
far 
excel 
all 
the 
other 
ways; 
yet 
because 
this 
part 
concerneth, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 
mint 
of 
knowledge 
(for 
words 
are 
the 
tokens 
current 
and 
accepted 
for 
conceits, 
as 
moneys 
are 
for 
values, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
fit 
men 
be 
not 
ignorant 
that 
moneys 
may 
be 
of 
another 
kind 
than 
gold 
and 
silver), 
I 
thought 
good 
to 
propound 
it 
to 
better 
inquiry. 
(4) 
Concerning 
speech 
and 
words, 
the 
consideration 
of 
them 
hath 
produced 
the 
science 
of 
grammar. 
For 
man 
still 
striveth 
to 
reintegrate 
himself 
in 
those 
benedictions, 
from 
which 
by 
his 
fault 
he 
hath 
been 
deprived; 
and 
as 
he 
hath 
striven 
against 
the 
first 
general 
curse 
by 
the 
invention 
of 
all 
other 
arts, 
so 
hath 
he 
sought 
to 
come 
forth 
of 
the 
second 
general 
curse 
(which 
was 
the 
confusion 
of 
tongues) 
by 
the 
art 
of 
grammar; 
whereof 
the 
use 
in 
a 
mother 
tongue 
is 
small, 
in 
a 
foreign 
tongue 
more; 
but 
most 
in 
such 
foreign 
tongues 
as 
have 
ceased 
to 
be 
vulgar 
tongues, 
and 
are 
turned 
only 
to 
learned 
tongues. 
The 
duty 
of 
it 
is 
of 
two 
natures: 
the 
one 
popular, 
which 
is 
for 
the 
speedy 
and 
perfect 
attaining 
languages, 
as 
well 
for 
intercourse 
of 
speech 
as 
for 
understanding 
of 
authors; 
the 
other 
philosophical, 
examining 
the 
power 
and 
nature 
of 
words, 
as 
they 
are 
the 
footsteps 
and 
prints 
of 
reason: 
which 
kind 
of 
analogy 
between 
words 
and 
reason 
is 
handled 
sparsim, 
brokenly 
though 
not 

entirely; 
and, 
therefore, 
I 
cannot 
report 
it 
deficient, 
though 
I 
think 
it 
very 
worthy 
to 
be 
reduced 
into 
a 
science 
by 
itself. 


(5) 
Unto 
grammar 
also 
belongeth, 
as 
an 
appendix, 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
accidents 
of 
words; 
which 
are 
measure, 
sound, 
and 
elevation 
or 
accent, 
and 
the 
sweetness 
and 
harshness 
of 
them: 
whence 
hath 
issued 
some 
curious 
observations 
in 
rhetoric, 
but 
chiefly 
poesy, 
as 
we 
consider 
it, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
verse 
and 
not 
of 
the 
argument. 
Wherein 
though 
men 
in 
learned 
tongues 
do 
tie 
themselves 
to 
the 
ancient 
measures, 
yet 
in 
modern 
languages 
it 
seemeth 
to 
me 
as 
free 
to 
make 
new 
measures 
of 
verses 
as 
of 
dances; 
for 
a 
dance 
is 
a 
measured 
pace, 
as 
a 
verse 
is 
a 
measured 
speech. 
In 
these 
things 
this 
sense 
is 
better 
judge 
than 
the 
art:— 
“Coenae 
fercula 
nostrae 
Mallem 
convivis 
quam 
placuisse 
cocis.” 


And 
of 
the 
servile 
expressing 
antiquity 
in 
an 
unlike 
and 
an 
unfit 
subject, 
it 
is 
well 
said, 
“Quod 
tempore 
antiquum 
videtur, 
id 
incongruitate 
est 
maxime 
novum.” 


(6) 
For 
ciphers, 
they 
are 
commonly 
in 
letters 
or 
alphabets, 
but 
may 
be 
in 
words. 
The 
kinds 
of 
ciphers 
(besides 
the 
simple 
ciphers, 
with 
changes, 
and 
intermixtures 
of 
nulls 
and 
non-significants) 
are 
many, 
according 
to 
the 
nature 
or 
rule 
of 
the 
infolding, 
wheel-ciphers, 
key-ciphers, 
doubles, 
&c. 
But 
the 
virtues 
of 
them, 
whereby 
they 
are 
to 
be 
preferred, 
are 
three; 
that 
they 
be 
not 
laborious 
to 
write 
and 
read; 
that 
they 
be 
impossible 
to 
decipher; 
and, 
in 
some 
cases, 
that 
they 
be 
without 
suspicion. 
The 
highest 
degree 
whereof 
is 
to 
write 
omnia 
per 
omnia; 
which 
is 
undoubtedly 
possible, 
with 
a 
proportion 
quintuple 
at 
most 
of 
the 
writing 
infolding 
to 
the 
writing 
infolded, 
and 
no 
other 
restraint 
whatsoever. 
This 
art 
of 
ciphering 
hath 
for 
relative 
an 
art 
of 
deciphering, 
by 
supposition 
unprofitable, 
but, 
as 
things 
are, 
of 
great 
use. 
For 
suppose 
that 
ciphers 
were 
well 
managed, 
there 
be 
multitudes 
of 
them 
which 
exclude 
the 
decipherer. 
But 
in 
regard 
of 
the 
rawness 
and 
unskilfulness 
of 
the 
hands 
through 
which 
they 
pass, 
the 
greatest 
matters 
are 
many 
times 
carried 
in 
the 
weakest 
ciphers. 
(7) 
In 
the 
enumeration 
of 
these 
private 
and 
retired 
arts 
it 
may 
be 
thought 
I 
seek 
to 
make 
a 
great 
muster-roll 
of 
sciences, 
naming 
them 
for 
show 
and 
ostentation, 
and 
to 
little 
other 
purpose. 
But 
let 
those, 
which 
are 
skilful 
in 
them, 
judge 
whether 
I 
bring 
them 
in 
only 
for 
appearance, 
or 
whether 
in 
that 

which 
I 
speak 
of 
them 
(though 
in 
few 
words) 
there 
be 
not 
some 
seed 
of 
proficience. 
And 
this 
must 
be 
remembered, 
that 
as 
there 
be 
many 
of 
great 
account 
in 
their 
countries 
and 
provinces, 
which, 
when 
they 
come 
up 
to 
the 
seat 
of 
the 
estate, 
are 
but 
of 
mean 
rank 
and 
scarcely 
regarded; 
so 
these 
arts, 
being 
here 
placed 
with 
the 
principal 
and 
supreme 
sciences, 
seem 
petty 
things: 
yet 
to 
such 
as 
have 
chosen 
them 
to 
spend 
their 
labours 
and 
studies 
in 
them, 
they 
seem 
great 
matters. 



XVII 


(1) 
For 
the 
method 
of 
tradition, 
I 
see 
it 
hath 
moved 
a 
controversy 
in 
our 
time. 
But 
as 
in 
civil 
business, 
if 
there 
be 
a 
meeting, 
and 
men 
fall 
at 
words, 
there 
is 
commonly 
an 
end 
of 
the 
matter 
for 
that 
time, 
and 
no 
proceeding 
at 
all; 
so 
in 
learning, 
where 
there 
is 
much 
controversy, 
there 
is 
many 
times 
little 
inquiry. 
For 
this 
part 
of 
knowledge 
of 
method 
seemeth 
to 
me 
so 
weakly 
inquired 
as 
I 
shall 
report 
it 
deficient. 
(2) 
Method 
hath 
been 
placed, 
and 
that 
not 
amiss, 
in 
logic, 
as 
a 
part 
of 
judgment. 
For 
as 
the 
doctrine 
of 
syllogisms 
comprehendeth 
the 
rules 
of 
judgment 
upon 
that 
which 
is 
invented, 
so 
the 
doctrine 
of 
method 
containeth 
the 
rules 
of 
judgment 
upon 
that 
which 
is 
to 
be 
delivered; 
for 
judgment 
precedeth 
delivery, 
as 
it 
followeth 
invention. 
Neither 
is 
the 
method 
or 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
tradition 
material 
only 
to 
the 
use 
of 
knowledge, 
but 
likewise 
to 
the 
progression 
of 
knowledge: 
for 
since 
the 
labour 
and 
life 
of 
one 
man 
cannot 
attain 
to 
perfection 
of 
knowledge, 
the 
wisdom 
of 
the 
tradition 
is 
that 
which 
inspireth 
the 
felicity 
of 
continuance 
and 
proceeding. 
And 
therefore 
the 
most 
real 
diversity 
of 
method 
is 
of 
method 
referred 
to 
use, 
and 
method 
referred 
to 
progression: 
whereof 
the 
one 
may 
be 
termed 
magistral, 
and 
the 
other 
of 
probation. 
(3) 
The 
latter 
whereof 
seemeth 
to 
be 
via 
deserta 
et 
interclusa. 
For 
as 
knowledges 
are 
now 
delivered, 
there 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
contract 
of 
error 
between 
the 
deliverer 
and 
the 
receiver. 
For 
he 
that 
delivereth 
knowledge 
desireth 
to 
deliver 
it 
in 
such 
form 
as 
may 
be 
best 
believed, 
and 
not 
as 
may 
be 
best 
examined; 
and 
he 
that 
receiveth 
knowledge 
desireth 
rather 
present 
satisfaction 
than 
expectant 
inquiry; 
and 
so 
rather 
not 
to 
doubt, 
than 
not 
to 
err: 
glory 
making 
the 
author 
not 
to 
lay 
open 
his 
weakness, 
and 
sloth 
making 
the 
disciple 
not 
to 
know 
his 
strength. 
(4) 
But 
knowledge 
that 
is 
delivered 
as 
a 
thread 
to 
be 
spun 
on 
ought 
to 
be 
delivered 
and 
intimated, 
if 
it 
were 
possible, 
in 
the 
same 
method 
wherein 
it 
was 
invented: 
and 
so 
is 
it 
possible 
of 
knowledge 
induced. 
But 
in 
this 
same 
anticipated 
and 
prevented 
knowledge, 
no 
man 
knoweth 
how 
he 
came 
to 
the 
knowledge 
which 
he 
hath 
obtained. 
But 
yet, 
nevertheless, 
secundum 
majus 
et 

minus, 
a 
man 
may 
revisit 
and 
descend 
unto 
the 
foundations 
of 
his 
knowledge 
and 
consent; 
and 
so 
transplant 
it 
into 
another, 
as 
it 
grew 
in 
his 
own 
mind. 
For 
it 
is 
in 
knowledges 
as 
it 
is 
in 
plants: 
if 
you 
mean 
to 
use 
the 
plant, 
it 
is 
no 
matter 
for 
the 
roots 
— 
but 
if 
you 
mean 
to 
remove 
it 
to 
grow, 
then 
it 
is 
more 
assured 
to 
rest 
upon 
roots 
than 
slips: 
so 
the 
delivery 
of 
knowledges 
(as 
it 
is 
now 
used) 
is 
as 
of 
fair 
bodies 
of 
trees 
without 
the 
roots; 
good 
for 
the 
carpenter, 
but 
not 
for 
the 
planter. 
But 
if 
you 
will 
have 
sciences 
grow, 
it 
is 
less 
matter 
for 
the 
shaft 
or 
body 
of 
the 
tree, 
so 
you 
look 
well 
to 
the 
taking 
up 
of 
the 
roots. 
Of 
which 
kind 
of 
delivery 
the 
method 
of 
the 
mathematics, 
in 
that 
subject, 
hath 
some 
shadow: 
but 
generally 
I 
see 
it 
neither 
put 
in 
use 
nor 
put 
in 
inquisition, 
and 
therefore 
note 
it 
for 
deficient. 


(5) 
Another 
diversity 
of 
method 
there 
is, 
which 
hath 
some 
affinity 
with 
the 
former, 
used 
in 
some 
cases 
by 
the 
discretion 
of 
the 
ancients, 
but 
disgraced 
since 
by 
the 
impostures 
of 
many 
vain 
persons, 
who 
have 
made 
it 
as 
a 
false 
light 
for 
their 
counterfeit 
merchandises; 
and 
that 
is 
enigmatical 
and 
disclosed. 
The 
pretence 
whereof 
is, 
to 
remove 
the 
vulgar 
capacities 
from 
being 
admitted 
to 
the 
secrets 
of 
knowledges, 
and 
to 
reserve 
them 
to 
selected 
auditors, 
or 
wits 
of 
such 
sharpness 
as 
can 
pierce 
the 
veil. 
(6) 
Another 
diversity 
of 
method, 
whereof 
the 
consequence 
is 
great, 
is 
the 
delivery 
of 
knowledge 
in 
aphorisms, 
or 
in 
methods; 
wherein 
we 
may 
observe 
that 
it 
hath 
been 
too 
much 
taken 
into 
custom, 
out 
of 
a 
few 
axioms 
or 
observations 
upon 
any 
subject, 
to 
make 
a 
solemn 
and 
formal 
art, 
filling 
it 
with 
some 
discourses, 
and 
illustrating 
it 
with 
examples, 
and 
digesting 
it 
into 
a 
sensible 
method. 
But 
the 
writing 
in 
aphorisms 
hath 
many 
excellent 
virtues, 
whereto 
the 
writing 
in 
method 
doth 
not 
approach. 
(7) 
For 
first, 
it 
trieth 
the 
writer, 
whether 
he 
be 
superficial 
or 
solid: 
for 
aphorisms, 
except 
they 
should 
be 
ridiculous, 
cannot 
be 
made 
but 
of 
the 
pith 
and 
heart 
of 
sciences; 
for 
discourse 
of 
illustration 
is 
cut 
off; 
recitals 
of 
examples 
are 
cut 
off; 
discourse 
of 
connection 
and 
order 
is 
cut 
off; 
descriptions 
of 
practice 
are 
cut 
off. 
So 
there 
remaineth 
nothing 
to 
fill 
the 
aphorisms 
but 
some 
good 
quantity 
of 
observation; 
and 
therefore 
no 
man 
can 
suffice, 
nor 
in 
reason 
will 
attempt, 
to 
write 
aphorisms, 
but 
he 
that 
is 
sound 
and 
grounded. 
But 
in 
methods, 
“Tantum 
series 
juncturaque 
pollet, 
Tantum 
de 
medio 
sumptis 
accedit 
honoris,” 



as 
a 
man 
shall 
make 
a 
great 
show 
of 
an 
art, 
which, 
if 
it 
were 
disjointed, 
would 
come 
to 
little. 
Secondly, 
methods 
are 
more 
fit 
to 
win 
consent 
or 
belief, 
but 
less 
fit 
to 
point 
to 
action; 
for 
they 
carry 
a 
kind 
of 
demonstration 
in 
orb 
or 
circle, 
one 
part 
illuminating 
another, 
and 
therefore 
satisfy. 
But 
particulars 
being 
dispersed 
do 
best 
agree 
with 
dispersed 
directions. 
And 
lastly, 
aphorisms, 
representing 
a 
knowledge 
broken, 
do 
invite 
men 
to 
inquire 
further; 
whereas 
methods, 
carrying 
the 
show 
of 
a 
total, 
do 
secure 
men, 
as 
if 
they 
were 
at 
furthest. 


(8) 
Another 
diversity 
of 
method, 
which 
is 
likewise 
of 
great 
weight, 
is 
the 
handling 
of 
knowledge 
by 
assertions 
and 
their 
proofs, 
or 
by 
questions 
and 
their 
determinations. 
The 
latter 
kind 
whereof, 
if 
it 
be 
immoderately 
followed, 
is 
as 
prejudicial 
to 
the 
proceeding 
of 
learning 
as 
it 
is 
to 
the 
proceeding 
of 
an 
army 
to 
go 
about 
to 
besiege 
every 
little 
fort 
or 
hold. 
For 
if 
the 
field 
be 
kept, 
and 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
enterprise 
pursued, 
those 
smaller 
things 
will 
come 
in 
of 
themselves: 
indeed 
a 
man 
would 
not 
leave 
some 
important 
piece 
enemy 
at 
his 
back. 
In 
like 
manner, 
the 
use 
of 
confutation 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
sciences 
ought 
to 
be 
very 
sparing; 
and 
to 
serve 
to 
remove 
strong 
preoccupations 
and 
prejudgments, 
and 
not 
to 
minister 
and 
excite 
disputatious 
and 
doubts. 
(9) 
Another 
diversity 
of 
method 
is, 
according 
to 
the 
subject 
or 
matter 
which 
is 
handled. 
For 
there 
is 
a 
great 
difference 
in 
delivery 
of 
the 
mathematics, 
which 
are 
the 
most 
abstracted 
of 
knowledges, 
and 
policy, 
which 
is 
the 
most 
immersed. 
And 
howsoever 
contention 
hath 
been 
moved, 
touching 
a 
uniformity 
of 
method 
in 
multiformity 
of 
matter, 
yet 
we 
see 
how 
that 
opinion, 
besides 
the 
weakness 
of 
it, 
hath 
been 
of 
ill 
desert 
towards 
learning, 
as 
that 
which 
taketh 
the 
way 
to 
reduce 
learning 
to 
certain 
empty 
and 
barren 
generalities; 
being 
but 
the 
very 
husks 
and 
shells 
of 
sciences, 
all 
the 
kernel 
being 
forced 
out 
and 
expulsed 
with 
the 
torture 
and 
press 
of 
the 
method. 
And, 
therefore, 
as 
I 
did 
allow 
well 
of 
particular 
topics 
for 
invention, 
so 
I 
do 
allow 
likewise 
of 
particular 
methods 
of 
tradition. 
(10) 
Another 
diversity 
of 
judgment 
in 
the 
delivery 
and 
teaching 
of 
knowledge 
is, 
according 
unto 
the 
light 
and 
presuppositions 
of 
that 
which 
is 
delivered. 
For 
that 
knowledge 
which 
is 
new, 
and 
foreign 
from 
opinions 
received, 
is 
to 
be 
delivered 
in 
another 
form 
than 
that 
that 
is 
agreeable 
and 
familiar; 
and 
therefore 
Aristotle, 
when 
he 
thinks 
to 
tax 
Democritus, 
doth 
in 
truth 
commend 
him, 
where 
he 
saith 
“If 
we 
shall 
indeed 
dispute, 
and 
not 
follow 
after 
similitudes,” 
&c. 
For 
those 
whose 
conceits 
are 
seated 
in 
popular 

opinions 
need 
only 
but 
to 
prove 
or 
dispute; 
but 
those 
whose 
conceits 
are 
beyond 
popular 
opinions, 
have 
a 
double 
labour; 
the 
one 
to 
make 
themselves 
conceived, 
and 
the 
other 
to 
prove 
and 
demonstrate. 
So 
that 
it 
is 
of 
necessity 
with 
them 
to 
have 
recourse 
to 
similitudes 
and 
translations 
to 
express 
themselves. 
And 
therefore 
in 
the 
infancy 
of 
learning, 
and 
in 
rude 
times 
when 
those 
conceits 
which 
are 
now 
trivial 
were 
then 
new, 
the 
world 
was 
full 
of 
parables 
and 
similitudes; 
for 
else 
would 
men 
either 
have 
passed 
over 
without 
mark, 
or 
else 
rejected 
for 
paradoxes 
that 
which 
was 
offered, 
before 
they 
had 
understood 
or 
judged. 
So 
in 
divine 
learning, 
we 
see 
how 
frequent 
parables 
and 
tropes 
are, 
for 
it 
is 
a 
rule, 
that 
whatsoever 
science 
is 
not 
consonant 
to 
presuppositions 
must 
pray 
in 
aid 
of 
similitudes. 


(11) 
There 
be 
also 
other 
diversities 
of 
methods 
vulgar 
and 
received: 
as 
that 
of 
resolution 
or 
analysis, 
of 
constitution 
or 
systasis, 
of 
concealment 
or 
cryptic, 
&c., 
which 
I 
do 
allow 
well 
of, 
though 
I 
have 
stood 
upon 
those 
which 
are 
least 
handled 
and 
observed. 
All 
which 
I 
have 
remembered 
to 
this 
purpose, 
because 
I 
would 
erect 
and 
constitute 
one 
general 
inquiry 
(which 
seems 
to 
me 
deficient) 
touching 
the 
wisdom 
of 
tradition. 
(12) 
But 
unto 
this 
part 
of 
knowledge, 
concerning 
method, 
doth 
further 
belong 
not 
only 
the 
architecture 
of 
the 
whole 
frame 
of 
a 
work, 
but 
also 
the 
several 
beams 
and 
columns 
thereof; 
not 
as 
to 
their 
stuff, 
but 
as 
to 
their 
quantity 
and 
figure. 
And 
therefore 
method 
considereth 
not 
only 
the 
disposition 
of 
the 
argument 
or 
subject, 
but 
likewise 
the 
propositions: 
not 
as 
to 
their 
truth 
or 
matter, 
but 
as 
to 
their 
limitation 
and 
manner. 
For 
herein 
Ramus 
merited 
better 
a 
great 
deal 
in 
reviving 
the 
good 
rules 
of 
propositions 
—? 
a????? 
p??t??, 
??ta 
pa?t?? 
&c.— 
than 
he 
did 
in 
introducing 
the 
canker 
of 
epitomes; 
and 
yet 
(as 
it 
is 
the 
condition 
of 
human 
things 
that, 
according 
to 
the 
ancient 
fables, 
“the 
most 
precious 
things 
have 
the 
most 
pernicious 
keepers”) 
it 
was 
so, 
that 
the 
attempt 
of 
the 
one 
made 
him 
fall 
upon 
the 
other. 
For 
he 
had 
need 
be 
well 
conducted 
that 
should 
design 
to 
make 
axioms 
convertible, 
if 
he 
make 
them 
not 
withal 
circular, 
and 
non-promovent, 
or 
incurring 
into 
themselves; 
but 
yet 
the 
intention 
was 
excellent. 
(13) 
The 
other 
considerations 
of 
method, 
concerning 
propositions, 
are 
chiefly 
touching 
the 
utmost 
propositions, 
which 
limit 
the 
dimensions 
of 
sciences: 
for 
every 
knowledge 
may 
be 
fitly 
said, 
besides 
the 
profundity 
(which 
is 
the 
truth 
and 
substance 
of 
it, 
that 
makes 
it 
solid), 
to 
have 
a 
longitude 
and 
a 
latitude; 
accounting 
the 
latitude 
towards 
other 
sciences, 
and 

the 
longitude 
towards 
action; 
that 
is, 
from 
the 
greatest 
generality 
to 
the 
most 
particular 
precept. 
The 
one 
giveth 
rule 
how 
far 
one 
knowledge 
ought 
to 
intermeddle 
within 
the 
province 
of 
another, 
which 
is 
the 
rule 
they 
call 
?a?a? 
t?; 
the 
other 
giveth 
rule 
unto 
what 
degree 
of 
particularity 
a 
knowledge 
should 
descend: 
which 
latter 
I 
find 
passed 
over 
in 
silence, 
being 
in 
my 
judgment 
the 
more 
material. 
For 
certainty 
there 
must 
be 
somewhat 
left 
to 
practice; 
but 
how 
much 
is 
worthy 
the 
inquiry? 
We 
see 
remote 
and 
superficial 
generalities 
do 
but 
offer 
knowledge 
to 
scorn 
of 
practical 
men; 
and 
are 
no 
more 
aiding 
to 
practice 
than 
an 
Ortelius’ 
universal 
map 
is 
to 
direct 
the 
way 
between 
London 
and 
York. 
The 
better 
sort 
of 
rules 
have 
been 
not 
unfitly 
compared 
to 
glasses 
of 
steel 
unpolished, 
where 
you 
may 
see 
the 
images 
of 
things, 
but 
first 
they 
must 
be 
filed: 
so 
the 
rules 
will 
help 
if 
they 
be 
laboured 
and 
polished 
by 
practice. 
But 
how 
crystalline 
they 
may 
be 
made 
at 
the 
first, 
and 
how 
far 
forth 
they 
may 
be 
polished 
aforehand, 
is 
the 
question, 
the 
inquiry 
whereof 
seemeth 
to 
me 
deficient. 


(14) 
There 
hath 
been 
also 
laboured 
and 
put 
in 
practice 
a 
method, 
which 
is 
not 
a 
lawful 
method, 
but 
a 
method 
of 
imposture: 
which 
is, 
to 
deliver 
knowledges 
in 
such 
manner 
as 
men 
may 
speedily 
come 
to 
make 
a 
show 
of 
learning, 
who 
have 
it 
not. 
Such 
was 
the 
travail 
of 
Raymundus 
Lullius 
in 
making 
that 
art 
which 
bears 
his 
name; 
not 
unlike 
to 
some 
books 
of 
typocosmy, 
which 
have 
been 
made 
since; 
being 
nothing 
but 
a 
mass 
of 
words 
of 
all 
arts, 
to 
give 
men 
countenance, 
that 
those 
which 
use 
the 
terms 
might 
be 
thought 
to 
understand 
the 
art; 
which 
collections 
are 
much 
like 
a 
fripper’s 
or 
broker’s 
shop, 
that 
hath 
ends 
of 
everything, 
but 
nothing 
of 
worth. 

XVIII 


(1) 
Now 
we 
descend 
to 
that 
part 
which 
concerneth 
the 
illustration 
of 
tradition, 
comprehended 
in 
that 
science 
which 
we 
call 
rhetoric, 
or 
art 
of 
eloquence, 
a 
science 
excellent, 
and 
excellently 
well 
laboured. 
For 
although 
in 
true 
value 
it 
is 
inferior 
to 
wisdom 
(as 
it 
is 
said 
by 
God 
to 
Moses, 
when 
he 
disabled 
himself 
for 
want 
of 
this 
faculty, 
“Aaron 
shall 
be 
thy 
speaker, 
and 
thou 
shalt 
be 
to 
him 
as 
God”), 
yet 
with 
people 
it 
is 
the 
more 
mighty; 
for 
so 
Solomon 
saith, 
Sapiens 
corde 
appellabitur 
prudens, 
sed 
dulcis 
eloquio 
majora 
reperiet, 
signifying 
that 
profoundness 
of 
wisdom 
will 
help 
a 
man 
to 
a 
name 
or 
admiration, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
eloquence 
that 
prevaileth 
in 
an 
active 
life. 
And 
as 
to 
the 
labouring 
of 
it, 
the 
emulation 
of 
Aristotle 
with 
the 
rhetoricians 
of 
his 
time, 
and 
the 
experience 
of 
Cicero, 
hath 
made 
them 
in 
their 
works 
of 
rhetoric 
exceed 
themselves. 
Again, 
the 
excellency 
of 
examples 
of 
eloquence 
in 
the 
orations 
of 
Demosthenes 
and 
Cicero, 
added 
to 
the 
perfection 
of 
the 
precepts 
of 
eloquence, 
hath 
doubled 
the 
progression 
in 
this 
art; 
and 
therefore 
the 
deficiences 
which 
I 
shall 
note 
will 
rather 
be 
in 
some 
collections, 
which 
may 
as 
handmaids 
attend 
the 
art, 
than 
in 
the 
rules 
or 
use 
of 
the 
art 
itself. 
(2) 
Notwithstanding, 
to 
stir 
the 
earth 
a 
little 
about 
the 
roots 
of 
this 
science, 
as 
we 
have 
done 
of 
the 
rest, 
the 
duty 
and 
office 
of 
rhetoric 
is 
to 
apply 
reason 
to 
imagination 
for 
the 
better 
moving 
of 
the 
will. 
For 
we 
see 
reason 
is 
disturbed 
in 
the 
administration 
thereof 
by 
three 
means 
— 
by 
illaqueation 
or 
sophism, 
which 
pertains 
to 
logic; 
by 
imagination 
or 
impression, 
which 
pertains 
to 
rhetoric; 
and 
by 
passion 
or 
affection, 
which 
pertains 
to 
morality. 
And 
as 
in 
negotiation 
with 
others, 
men 
are 
wrought 
by 
cunning, 
by 
importunity, 
and 
by 
vehemency; 
so 
in 
this 
negotiation 
within 
ourselves, 
men 
are 
undermined 
by 
inconsequences, 
solicited 
and 
importuned 
by 
impressions 
or 
observations, 
and 
transported 
by 
passions. 
Neither 
is 
the 
nature 
of 
man 
so 
unfortunately 
built, 
as 
that 
those 
powers 
and 
arts 
should 
have 
force 
to 
disturb 
reason, 
and 
not 
to 
establish 
and 
advance 
it. 
For 
the 
end 
of 
logic 
is 
to 
teach 
a 
form 
of 
argument 
to 
secure 
reason, 
and 
not 
to 
entrap 
it; 
the 
end 
of 
morality 
is 
to 
procure 
the 
affections 
to 
obey 
reason, 
and 
not 
to 
invade 
it; 
the 
end 
of 
rhetoric 
is 
to 
fill 
the 
imagination 
to 
second 
reason, 
and 
not 
to 
oppress 
it; 
for 
these 
abuses 
of 
arts 
come 
in 
but 
ex 
oblique, 
for 
caution. 

(3) 
And 
therefore 
it 
was 
great 
injustice 
in 
Plato, 
though 
springing 
out 
of 
a 
just 
hatred 
to 
the 
rhetoricians 
of 
his 
time, 
to 
esteem 
of 
rhetoric 
but 
as 
a 
voluptuary 
art, 
resembling 
it 
to 
cookery, 
that 
did 
mar 
wholesome 
meats, 
and 
help 
unwholesome 
by 
variety 
of 
sauces 
to 
the 
pleasure 
of 
the 
taste. 
For 
we 
see 
that 
speech 
is 
much 
more 
conversant 
in 
adorning 
that 
which 
is 
good 
than 
in 
colouring 
that 
which 
is 
evil; 
for 
there 
is 
no 
man 
but 
speaketh 
more 
honestly 
than 
he 
can 
do 
or 
think; 
and 
it 
was 
excellently 
noted 
by 
Thucydides, 
in 
Cleon, 
that 
because 
he 
used 
to 
hold 
on 
the 
bad 
side 
in 
causes 
of 
estate, 
therefore 
he 
was 
ever 
inveighing 
against 
eloquence 
and 
good 
speech, 
knowing 
that 
no 
man 
can 
speak 
fair 
of 
courses 
sordid 
and 
base. 
And 
therefore, 
as 
Plato 
said 
elegantly, 
“That 
virtue, 
if 
she 
could 
be 
seen, 
would 
move 
great 
love 
and 
affection;” 
so 
seeing 
that 
she 
cannot 
be 
showed 
to 
the 
sense 
by 
corporal 
shape, 
the 
next 
degree 
is 
to 
show 
her 
to 
the 
imagination 
in 
lively 
representation; 
for 
to 
show 
her 
to 
reason 
only 
in 
subtlety 
of 
argument 
was 
a 
thing 
ever 
derided 
in 
Chrysippus 
and 
many 
of 
the 
Stoics, 
who 
thought 
to 
thrust 
virtue 
upon 
men 
by 
sharp 
disputations 
and 
conclusions, 
which 
have 
no 
sympathy 
with 
the 
will 
of 
man. 
(4) 
Again, 
if 
the 
affections 
in 
themselves 
were 
pliant 
and 
obedient 
to 
reason, 
it 
were 
true 
there 
should 
be 
no 
great 
use 
of 
persuasions 
and 
insinuations 
to 
the 
will, 
more 
than 
of 
naked 
proposition 
and 
proofs; 
but 
in 
regard 
of 
the 
continual 
mutinies 
and 
seditious 
of 
the 
affections 
— 
“Video 
meliora, 
proboque, 
Deteriora 
sequor,” 


reason 
would 
become 
captive 
and 
servile, 
if 
eloquence 
of 
persuasions 
did 
not 
practise 
and 
win 
the 
imagination 
from 
the 
affections’ 
part, 
and 
contract 
a 
confederacy 
between 
the 
reason 
and 
imagination 
against 
the 
affections; 
for 
the 
affections 
themselves 
carry 
ever 
an 
appetite 
to 
good, 
as 
reason 
doth. 
The 
difference 
is, 
that 
the 
affection 
beholdeth 
merely 
the 
present; 
reason 
beholdeth 
the 
future 
and 
sum 
of 
time. 
And, 
therefore, 
the 
present 
filling 
the 
imagination 
more, 
reason 
is 
commonly 
vanquished; 
but 
after 
that 
force 
of 
eloquence 
and 
persuasion 
hath 
made 
things 
future 
and 
remote 
appear 
as 
present, 
then 
upon 
the 
revolt 
of 
the 
imagination 
reason 
prevaileth. 


(5) 
We 
conclude, 
therefore, 
that 
rhetoric 
can 
be 
no 
more 
charged 
with 
the 
colouring 
of 
the 
worst 
part, 
than 
logic 
with 
sophistry, 
or 
morality 

with 
vice; 
for 
we 
know 
the 
doctrines 
of 
contraries 
are 
the 
same, 
though 
the 
use 
be 
opposite. 
It 
appeareth 
also 
that 
logic 
differeth 
from 
rhetoric, 
not 
only 
as 
the 
fist 
from 
the 
palm 
— 
the 
one 
close, 
the 
other 
at 
large 
— 
but 
much 
more 
in 
this, 
that 
logic 
handleth 
reason 
exact 
and 
in 
truth, 
and 
rhetoric 
handleth 
it 
as 
it 
is 
planted 
in 
popular 
opinions 
and 
manners. 
And 
therefore 
Aristotle 
doth 
wisely 
place 
rhetoric 
as 
between 
logic 
on 
the 
one 
side, 
and 
moral 
or 
civil 
knowledge 
on 
the 
other, 
as 
participating 
of 
both; 
for 
the 
proofs 
and 
demonstrations 
of 
logic 
are 
toward 
all 
men 
indifferent 
and 
the 
same, 
but 
the 
proofs 
and 
persuasions 
of 
rhetoric 
ought 
to 
differ 
according 
to 
the 
auditors:— 


“Orpheus 
in 
sylvis, 
inter 
delphinas 
Arion.” 


Which 
application 
in 
perfection 
of 
idea 
ought 
to 
extend 
so 
far 
that 
if 
a 
man 
should 
speak 
of 
the 
same 
thing 
to 
several 
persons, 
he 
should 
speak 
to 
them 
all 
respectively 
and 
several 
ways; 
though 
this 
politic 
part 
of 
eloquence 
in 
private 
speech 
it 
is 
easy 
for 
the 
greatest 
orators 
to 
want: 
whilst, 
by 
the 
observing 
their 
well-graced 
forms 
of 
speech, 
they 
leese 
the 
volubility 
of 
application; 
and 
therefore 
it 
shall 
not 
be 
amiss 
to 
recommend 
this 
to 
better 
inquiry, 
not 
being 
curious 
whether 
we 
place 
it 
here 
or 
in 
that 
part 
which 
concerneth 
policy. 


(6) 
Now 
therefore 
will 
I 
descend 
to 
the 
deficiences, 
which, 
as 
I 
said, 
are 
but 
attendances; 
and 
first, 
I 
do 
not 
find 
the 
wisdom 
and 
diligence 
of 
Aristotle 
well 
pursued, 
who 
began 
to 
make 
a 
collection 
of 
the 
popular 
signs 
and 
colours 
of 
good 
and 
evil, 
both 
simple 
and 
comparative, 
which 
are 
as 
the 
sophisms 
of 
rhetoric 
(as 
I 
touched 
before). 
For 
example 
— 
“Sophisma. 
Quod 
laudatur, 
bonum: 
quod 
vituperatur, 
malum. 
Redargutio. 
Laudat 
venales 
qui 
vult 
extrudere 
merces.” 


Malum 
est, 
malum 
est 
(inquit 
emptor): 
sed 
cum 
recesserit, 
tum 
gloriabitur! 
The 
defects 
in 
the 
labour 
of 
Aristotle 
are 
three 
— 
one, 
that 
there 
be 
but 
a 
few 
of 
many; 
another, 
that 
there 
elenches 
are 
not 
annexed; 
and 
the 
third, 
that 
he 
conceived 
but 
a 
part 
of 
the 
use 
of 
them: 
for 
their 
use 
is 
not 
only 
in 
probation, 
but 
much 
more 
in 
impression. 
For 
many 
forms 
are 
equal 
in 
signification 
which 
are 
differing 
in 
impression, 
as 
the 
difference 
is 
great 
in 
the 
piercing 
of 
that 
which 
is 
sharp 
and 
that 
which 
is 
flat, 
though 
the 
strength 



of 
the 
percussion 
be 
the 
same. 
For 
there 
is 
no 
man 
but 
will 
be 
a 
little 
more 
raised 
by 
hearing 
it 
said, 
“Your 
enemies 
will 
be 
glad 
of 
this” 
— 


“Hoc 
Ithacus 
velit, 
et 
magno 
mercentur 
Atridae.” 


than 
by 
hearing 
it 
said 
only, 
“This 
is 
evil 
for 
you.” 


(7) 
Secondly, 
I 
do 
resume 
also 
that 
which 
I 
mentioned 
before, 
touching 
provision 
or 
preparatory 
store 
for 
the 
furniture 
of 
speech 
and 
readiness 
of 
invention, 
which 
appeareth 
to 
be 
of 
two 
sorts: 
the 
one 
in 
resemblance 
to 
a 
shop 
of 
pieces 
unmade 
up, 
the 
other 
to 
a 
shop 
of 
things 
ready 
made 
up; 
both 
to 
be 
applied 
to 
that 
which 
is 
frequent 
and 
most 
in 
request. 
The 
former 
of 
these 
I 
will 
call 
antitheta, 
and 
the 
latter 
formulae. 
(8) 
Antitheta 
are 
theses 
argued 
pro 
et 
contra, 
wherein 
men 
may 
be 
more 
large 
and 
laborious; 
but 
(in 
such 
as 
are 
able 
to 
do 
it) 
to 
avoid 
prolixity 
of 
entry, 
I 
wish 
the 
seeds 
of 
the 
several 
arguments 
to 
be 
cast 
up 
into 
some 
brief 
and 
acute 
sentences, 
not 
to 
be 
cited, 
but 
to 
be 
as 
skeins 
or 
bottoms 
of 
thread, 
to 
be 
unwinded 
at 
large 
when 
they 
come 
to 
be 
used; 
supplying 
authorities 
and 
examples 
by 
reference. 
“Pro 
verbis 
legis. 
Non 
est 
interpretatio, 
sed 
divinatio, 
quae 
recedit 
a 
litera:— 
Cum 
receditur 
a 
litera, 
judex 
transit 
in 
legislatorem. 


Pro 
sententia 
legis. 
Ex 
omnibus 
verbis 
est 
eliciendus 
sensus 
qui 
interpretatur 
singula.” 


(9) 
Formulae 
are 
but 
decent 
and 
apt 
passages 
or 
conveyances 
of 
speech, 
which 
may 
serve 
indifferently 
for 
differing 
subjects; 
as 
of 
preface, 
conclusion, 
digression, 
transition, 
excusation, 
&c. 
For 
as 
in 
buildings 
there 
is 
great 
pleasure 
and 
use 
in 
the 
well 
casting 
of 
the 
staircases, 
entries, 
doors, 
windows, 
and 
the 
like; 
so 
in 
speech, 
the 
conveyances 
and 
passages 
are 
of 
special 
ornament 
and 
effect. 
“A 
conclusion 
in 
a 
deliberative. 
So 
may 
we 
redeem 
the 
faults 
passed, 
and 
prevent 
the 
inconveniences 
future.” 



XIX 


(1) 
There 
remain 
two 
appendices 
touching 
the 
tradition 
of 
knowledge, 
the 
one 
critical, 
the 
other 
pedantical. 
For 
all 
knowledge 
is 
either 
delivered 
by 
teachers, 
or 
attained 
by 
men’s 
proper 
endeavours: 
and 
therefore 
as 
the 
principal 
part 
of 
tradition 
of 
knowledge 
concerneth 
chiefly 
writing 
of 
books, 
so 
the 
relative 
part 
thereof 
concerneth 
reading 
of 
books; 
whereunto 
appertain 
incidently 
these 
considerations. 
The 
first 
is 
concerning 
the 
true 
correction 
and 
edition 
of 
authors; 
wherein 
nevertheless 
rash 
diligence 
hath 
done 
great 
prejudice. 
For 
these 
critics 
have 
often 
presumed 
that 
that 
which 
they 
understand 
not 
is 
false 
set 
down: 
as 
the 
priest 
that, 
where 
he 
found 
it 
written 
of 
St. 
Paul 
Demissus 
est 
per 
sportam, 
mended 
his 
book, 
and 
made 
it 
Demissus 
est 
per 
portam; 
because 
sporta 
was 
a 
hard 
word, 
and 
out 
of 
his 
reading: 
and 
surely 
their 
errors, 
though 
they 
be 
not 
so 
palpable 
and 
ridiculous, 
yet 
are 
of 
the 
same 
kind. 
And 
therefore, 
as 
it 
hath 
been 
wisely 
noted, 
the 
most 
corrected 
copies 
are 
commonly 
the 
least 
correct. 
The 
second 
is 
concerning 
the 
exposition 
and 
explication 
of 
authors, 
which 
resteth 
in 
annotations 
and 
commentaries: 
wherein 
it 
is 
over 
usual 
to 
blanch 
the 
obscure 
places 
and 
discourse 
upon 
the 
plain. 


The 
third 
is 
concerning 
the 
times, 
which 
in 
many 
cases 
give 
great 
light 
to 
true 
interpretations. 


The 
fourth 
is 
concerning 
some 
brief 
censure 
and 
judgment 
of 
the 
authors; 
that 
men 
thereby 
may 
make 
some 
election 
unto 
themselves 
what 
books 
to 
read. 


And 
the 
fifth 
is 
concerning 
the 
syntax 
and 
disposition 
of 
studies; 
that 
men 
may 
know 
in 
what 
order 
or 
pursuit 
to 
read. 


(2) 
For 
pedantical 
knowledge, 
it 
containeth 
that 
difference 
of 
tradition 
which 
is 
proper 
for 
youth; 
whereunto 
appertain 
divers 
considerations 
of 
great 
fruit. 
As 
first, 
the 
timing 
and 
seasoning 
of 
knowledges; 
as 
with 
what 
to 
initiate 
them, 
and 
from 
what 
for 
a 
time 
to 
refrain 
them. 



Secondly, 
the 
consideration 
where 
to 
begin 
with 
the 
easiest, 
and 
so 
proceed 
to 
the 
more 
difficult; 
and 
in 
what 
courses 
to 
press 
the 
more 
difficult, 
and 
then 
to 
turn 
them 
to 
the 
more 
easy; 
for 
it 
is 
one 
method 
to 
practise 
swimming 
with 
bladders, 
and 
another 
to 
practise 
dancing 
with 
heavy 
shoes. 


A 
third 
is 
the 
application 
of 
learning 
according 
unto 
the 
propriety 
of 
the 
wits; 
for 
there 
is 
no 
defect 
in 
the 
faculties 
intellectual, 
but 
seemeth 
to 
have 
a 
proper 
cure 
contained 
in 
some 
studies: 
as, 
for 
example, 
if 
a 
child 
be 
bird-witted, 
that 
is, 
hath 
not 
the 
faculty 
of 
attention, 
the 
mathematics 
giveth 
a 
remedy 
thereunto; 
for 
in 
them, 
if 
the 
wit 
be 
caught 
away 
but 
a 
moment, 
one 
is 
new 
to 
begin. 
And 
as 
sciences 
have 
a 
propriety 
towards 
faculties 
for 
cure 
and 
help, 
so 
faculties 
or 
powers 
have 
a 
sympathy 
towards 
sciences 
for 
excellency 
or 
speedy 
profiting: 
and 
therefore 
it 
is 
an 
inquiry 
of 
great 
wisdom, 
what 
kinds 
of 
wits 
and 
natures 
are 
most 
apt 
and 
proper 
for 
what 
sciences. 


Fourthly, 
the 
ordering 
of 
exercises 
is 
matter 
of 
great 
consequence 
to 
hurt 
or 
help: 
for, 
as 
is 
well 
observed 
by 
Cicero, 
men 
in 
exercising 
their 
faculties, 
if 
they 
be 
not 
well 
advised, 
do 
exercise 
their 
faults 
and 
get 
ill 
habits 
as 
well 
as 
good; 
so 
as 
there 
is 
a 
great 
judgment 
to 
be 
had 
in 
the 
continuance 
and 
intermission 
of 
exercises. 
It 
were 
too 
long 
to 
particularise 
a 
number 
of 
other 
considerations 
of 
this 
nature, 
things 
but 
of 
mean 
appearance, 
but 
of 
singular 
efficacy. 
For 
as 
the 
wronging 
or 
cherishing 
of 
seeds 
or 
young 
plants 
is 
that 
that 
is 
most 
important 
to 
their 
thriving, 
and 
as 
it 
was 
noted 
that 
the 
first 
six 
kings 
being 
in 
truth 
as 
tutors 
of 
the 
state 
of 
Rome 
in 
the 
infancy 
thereof 
was 
the 
principal 
cause 
of 
the 
immense 
greatness 
of 
that 
state 
which 
followed, 
so 
the 
culture 
and 
manurance 
of 
minds 
in 
youth 
hath 
such 
a 
forcible 
(though 
unseen) 
operation, 
as 
hardly 
any 
length 
of 
time 
or 
contention 
of 
labour 
can 
countervail 
it 
afterwards. 
And 
it 
is 
not 
amiss 
to 
observe 
also 
how 
small 
and 
mean 
faculties 
gotten 
by 
education, 
yet 
when 
they 
fall 
into 
great 
men 
or 
great 
matters, 
do 
work 
great 
and 
important 
effects: 
whereof 
we 
see 
a 
notable 
example 
in 
Tacitus 
of 
two 
stage 
players, 
Percennius 
and 
Vibulenus, 
who 
by 
their 
faculty 
of 
playing 
put 
the 
Pannonian 
armies 
into 
an 
extreme 
tumult 
and 
combustion. 
For 
there 
arising 
a 
mutiny 
amongst 
them 
upon 
the 
death 
of 
Augustus 
Caesar, 
Blaesus 
the 
lieutenant 
had 
committed 
some 
of 
the 
mutineers, 
which 
were 
suddenly 
rescued; 
whereupon 
Vibulenus 
got 
to 
be 
heard 
speak, 
which 
he 
did 
in 
this 
manner:— 
“These 
poor 
innocent 
wretches 
appointed 
to 
cruel 
death, 
you 
have 
restored 
to 
behold 
the 
light; 
but 
who 
shall 
restore 
my 
brother 
to 
me, 
or 
life 
unto 
my 
brother, 
that 
was 
sent 



hither 
in 
message 
from 
the 
legions 
of 
Germany, 
to 
treat 
of 
the 
common 
cause? 
and 
he 
hath 
murdered 
him 
this 
last 
night 
by 
some 
of 
his 
fencers 
and 
ruffians, 
that 
he 
hath 
about 
him 
for 
his 
executioners 
upon 
soldiers. 
Answer, 
Blaesus, 
what 
is 
done 
with 
his 
body? 
The 
mortalest 
enemies 
do 
not 
deny 
burial. 
When 
I 
have 
performed 
my 
last 
duties 
to 
the 
corpse 
with 
kisses, 
with 
tears, 
command 
me 
to 
be 
slain 
besides 
him; 
so 
that 
these 
my 
fellows, 
for 
our 
good 
meaning 
and 
our 
true 
hearts 
to 
the 
legions, 
may 
have 
leave 
to 
bury 
us.” 
With 
which 
speech 
he 
put 
the 
army 
into 
an 
infinite 
fury 
and 
uproar: 
whereas 
truth 
was 
he 
had 
no 
brother, 
neither 
was 
there 
any 
such 
matter; 
but 
he 
played 
it 
merely 
as 
if 
he 
had 
been 
upon 
the 
stage. 


(3) 
But 
to 
return: 
we 
are 
now 
come 
to 
a 
period 
of 
rational 
knowledges; 
wherein 
if 
I 
have 
made 
the 
divisions 
other 
than 
those 
that 
are 
received, 
yet 
would 
I 
not 
be 
thought 
to 
disallow 
all 
those 
divisions 
which 
I 
do 
not 
use. 
For 
there 
is 
a 
double 
necessity 
imposed 
upon 
me 
of 
altering 
the 
divisions. 
The 
one, 
because 
it 
differeth 
in 
end 
and 
purpose, 
to 
sort 
together 
those 
things 
which 
are 
next 
in 
nature, 
and 
those 
things 
which 
are 
next 
in 
use. 
For 
if 
a 
secretary 
of 
estate 
should 
sort 
his 
papers, 
it 
is 
like 
in 
his 
study 
or 
general 
cabinet 
he 
would 
sort 
together 
things 
of 
a 
nature, 
as 
treaties, 
instructions, 
&c. 
But 
in 
his 
boxes 
or 
particular 
cabinet 
he 
would 
sort 
together 
those 
that 
he 
were 
like 
to 
use 
together, 
though 
of 
several 
natures. 
So 
in 
this 
general 
cabinet 
of 
knowledge 
it 
was 
necessary 
for 
me 
to 
follow 
the 
divisions 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
things; 
whereas 
if 
myself 
had 
been 
to 
handle 
any 
particular 
knowledge, 
I 
would 
have 
respected 
the 
divisions 
fittest 
for 
use. 
The 
other, 
because 
the 
bringing 
in 
of 
the 
deficiences 
did 
by 
consequence 
alter 
the 
partitions 
of 
the 
rest. 
For 
let 
the 
knowledge 
extant 
(for 
demonstration 
sake) 
be 
fifteen. 
Let 
the 
knowledge 
with 
the 
deficiences 
be 
twenty; 
the 
parts 
of 
fifteen 
are 
not 
the 
parts 
of 
twenty; 
for 
the 
parts 
of 
fifteen 
are 
three 
and 
five; 
the 
parts 
of 
twenty 
are 
two, 
four, 
five, 
and 
ten. 
So 
as 
these 
things 
are 
without 
contradiction, 
and 
could 
not 
otherwise 
be. 

XX 


(1) 
We 
proceed 
now 
to 
that 
knowledge 
which 
considereth 
of 
the 
appetite 
and 
will 
of 
man: 
whereof 
Solomon 
saith, 
Ante 
omnia, 
fili, 
custodi 
cor 
tuum: 
nam 
inde 
procedunt 
actiones 
vitae. 
In 
the 
handling 
of 
this 
science, 
those 
which 
have 
written 
seem 
to 
me 
to 
have 
done 
as 
if 
a 
man, 
that 
professed 
to 
teach 
to 
write, 
did 
only 
exhibit 
fair 
copies 
of 
alphabets 
and 
letters 
joined, 
without 
giving 
any 
precepts 
or 
directions 
for 
the 
carriage 
of 
the 
hand 
and 
framing 
of 
the 
letters. 
So 
have 
they 
made 
good 
and 
fair 
exemplars 
and 
copies, 
carrying 
the 
draughts 
and 
portraitures 
of 
good, 
virtue, 
duty, 
felicity; 
propounding 
them 
well 
described 
as 
the 
true 
objects 
and 
scopes 
of 
man’s 
will 
and 
desires. 
But 
how 
to 
attain 
these 
excellent 
marks, 
and 
how 
to 
frame 
and 
subdue 
the 
will 
of 
man 
to 
become 
true 
and 
conformable 
to 
these 
pursuits, 
they 
pass 
it 
over 
altogether, 
or 
slightly 
and 
unprofitably. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
the 
disputing 
that 
moral 
virtues 
are 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
by 
habit 
and 
not 
by 
nature, 
or 
the 
distinguishing 
that 
generous 
spirits 
are 
won 
by 
doctrines 
and 
persuasions, 
and 
the 
vulgar 
sort 
by 
reward 
and 
punishment, 
and 
the 
like 
scattered 
glances 
and 
touches, 
that 
can 
excuse 
the 
absence 
of 
this 
part. 
(2) 
The 
reason 
of 
this 
omission 
I 
suppose 
to 
be 
that 
hidden 
rock 
whereupon 
both 
this 
and 
many 
other 
barks 
of 
knowledge 
have 
been 
cast 
away; 
which 
is, 
that 
men 
have 
despised 
to 
be 
conversant 
in 
ordinary 
and 
common 
matters, 
the 
judicious 
direction 
whereof 
nevertheless 
is 
the 
wisest 
doctrine 
(for 
life 
consisteth 
not 
in 
novelties 
nor 
subtleties), 
but 
contrariwise 
they 
have 
compounded 
sciences 
chiefly 
of 
a 
certain 
resplendent 
or 
lustrous 
mass 
of 
matter, 
chosen 
to 
give 
glory 
either 
to 
the 
subtlety 
of 
disputatious, 
or 
to 
the 
eloquence 
of 
discourses. 
But 
Seneca 
giveth 
an 
excellent 
check 
to 
eloquence, 
Nocet 
illis 
eloquentia, 
quibus 
non 
rerum 
cupiditatem 
facit, 
sed 
sui. 
Doctrine 
should 
be 
such 
as 
should 
make 
men 
in 
love 
with 
the 
lesson, 
and 
not 
with 
the 
teacher; 
being 
directed 
to 
the 
auditor’s 
benefit, 
and 
not 
to 
the 
author’s 
commendation. 
And 
therefore 
those 
are 
of 
the 
right 
kind 
which 
may 
be 
concluded 
as 
Demosthenes 
concludes 
his 
counsel, 
Quae 
si 
feceritis, 
non 
oratorem 
dumtaxat 
in 
praesentia 
laudabitis, 
sed 
vosmetipsos 
etiam 
non 
ita 
multo 
post 
statu 
rerum 
vestraram 
meliore. 

(3) 
Neither 
needed 
men 
of 
so 
excellent 
parts 
to 
have 
despaired 
of 
a 
fortune, 
which 
the 
poet 
Virgil 
promised 
himself, 
and 
indeed 
obtained, 
who 
got 
as 
much 
glory 
of 
eloquence, 
wit, 
and 
learning 
in 
the 
expressing 
of 
the 
observations 
of 
husbandry, 
as 
of 
the 
heroical 
acts 
of 
AEneas:— 
“Nec 
sum 
animi 
dubius, 
verbis 
ea 
vincere 
magnum 
Quam 
sit, 
et 
angustis 
his 
addere 
rebus 
honorem.” 


And 
surely, 
if 
the 
purpose 
be 
in 
good 
earnest, 
not 
to 
write 
at 
leisure 
that 
which 
men 
may 
read 
at 
leisure, 
but 
really 
to 
instruct 
and 
suborn 
action 
and 
active 
life, 
these 
Georgics 
of 
the 
mind, 
concerning 
the 
husbandry 
and 
tillage 
thereof, 
are 
no 
less 
worthy 
than 
the 
heroical 
descriptions 
of 
virtue, 
duty, 
and 
felicity. 
Wherefore 
the 
main 
and 
primitive 
division 
of 
moral 
knowledge 
seemeth 
to 
be 
into 
the 
exemplar 
or 
platform 
of 
good, 
and 
the 
regiment 
or 
culture 
of 
the 
mind: 
the 
one 
describing 
the 
nature 
of 
good, 
the 
other 
prescribing 
rules 
how 
to 
subdue, 
apply, 
and 
accommodate 
the 
will 
of 
man 
thereunto. 


(4) 
The 
doctrine 
touching 
the 
platform 
or 
nature 
of 
good 
considereth 
it 
either 
simple 
or 
compared; 
either 
the 
kinds 
of 
good, 
or 
the 
degrees 
of 
good; 
in 
the 
latter 
whereof 
those 
infinite 
disputatious 
which 
were 
touching 
the 
supreme 
degree 
thereof, 
which 
they 
term 
felicity, 
beatitude, 
or 
the 
highest 
good, 
the 
doctrines 
concerning 
which 
were 
as 
the 
heathen 
divinity, 
are 
by 
the 
Christian 
faith 
discharged. 
And 
as 
Aristotle 
saith, 
“That 
young 
men 
may 
be 
happy, 
but 
not 
otherwise 
but 
by 
hope;” 
so 
we 
must 
all 
acknowledge 
our 
minority, 
and 
embrace 
the 
felicity 
which 
is 
by 
hope 
of 
the 
future 
world. 
(5) 
Freed 
therefore 
and 
delivered 
from 
this 
doctrine 
of 
the 
philosopher’s 
heaven, 
whereby 
they 
feigned 
a 
higher 
elevation 
of 
man’s 
nature 
than 
was 
(for 
we 
see 
in 
what 
height 
of 
style 
Seneca 
writeth, 
Vere 
magnum, 
habere 
fragilitatem 
hominis, 
securitatem 
Dei), 
we 
may 
with 
more 
sobriety 
and 
truth 
receive 
the 
rest 
of 
their 
inquiries 
and 
labours. 
Wherein 
for 
the 
nature 
of 
good 
positive 
or 
simple, 
they 
have 
set 
it 
down 
excellently 
in 
describing 
the 
forms 
of 
virtue 
and 
duty, 
with 
their 
situations 
and 
postures; 
in 
distributing 
them 
into 
their 
kinds, 
parts, 
provinces, 
actions, 
and 
administrations, 
and 
the 
like: 
nay 
further, 
they 
have 
commended 
them 
to 
man’s 
nature 
and 
spirit 
with 
great 
quickness 
of 
argument 
and 
beauty 
of 
persuasions; 
yea, 
and 
fortified 
and 
entrenched 
them 
(as 
much 
as 
discourse 
can 
do) 
against 
corrupt 
and 
popular 
opinions. 
Again, 
for 
the 
degrees 
and 

comparative 
nature 
of 
good, 
they 
have 
also 
excellently 
handled 
it 
in 
their 
triplicity 
of 
good, 
in 
the 
comparisons 
between 
a 
contemplative 
and 
an 
active 
life, 
in 
the 
distinction 
between 
virtue 
with 
reluctation 
and 
virtue 
secured, 
in 
their 
encounters 
between 
honesty 
and 
profit, 
in 
their 
balancing 
of 
virtue 
with 
virtue, 
and 
the 
like; 
so 
as 
this 
part 
deserveth 
to 
be 
reported 
for 
excellently 
laboured. 


(6) 
Notwithstanding, 
if 
before 
they 
had 
come 
to 
the 
popular 
and 
received 
notions 
of 
virtue 
and 
vice, 
pleasure 
and 
pain, 
and 
the 
rest, 
they 
had 
stayed 
a 
little 
longer 
upon 
the 
inquiry 
concerning 
the 
roots 
of 
good 
and 
evil, 
and 
the 
strings 
of 
those 
roots, 
they 
had 
given, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
a 
great 
light 
to 
that 
which 
followed; 
and 
specially 
if 
they 
had 
consulted 
with 
nature, 
they 
had 
made 
their 
doctrines 
less 
prolix 
and 
more 
profound: 
which 
being 
by 
them 
in 
part 
omitted 
and 
in 
part 
handled 
with 
much 
confusion, 
we 
will 
endeavour 
to 
resume 
and 
open 
in 
a 
more 
clear 
manner. 
(7) 
There 
is 
formed 
in 
everything 
a 
double 
nature 
of 
good 
— 
the 
one, 
as 
everything 
is 
a 
total 
or 
substantive 
in 
itself; 
the 
other, 
as 
it 
is 
a 
part 
or 
member 
of 
a 
greater 
body; 
whereof 
the 
latter 
is 
in 
degree 
the 
greater 
and 
the 
worthier, 
because 
it 
tendeth 
to 
the 
conservation 
of 
a 
more 
general 
form. 
Therefore 
we 
see 
the 
iron 
in 
particular 
sympathy 
moveth 
to 
the 
loadstone; 
but 
yet 
if 
it 
exceed 
a 
certain 
quantity, 
it 
forsaketh 
the 
affection 
to 
the 
loadstone, 
and 
like 
a 
good 
patriot 
moveth 
to 
the 
earth, 
which 
is 
the 
region 
and 
country 
of 
massy 
bodies; 
so 
may 
we 
go 
forward, 
and 
see 
that 
water 
and 
massy 
bodies 
move 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
earth; 
but 
rather 
than 
to 
suffer 
a 
divulsion 
in 
the 
continuance 
of 
nature, 
they 
will 
move 
upwards 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
earth, 
forsaking 
their 
duty 
to 
the 
earth 
in 
regard 
of 
their 
duty 
to 
the 
world. 
This 
double 
nature 
of 
good, 
and 
the 
comparative 
thereof, 
is 
much 
more 
engraven 
upon 
man, 
if 
he 
degenerate 
not, 
unto 
whom 
the 
conservation 
of 
duty 
to 
the 
public 
ought 
to 
be 
much 
more 
precious 
than 
the 
conservation 
of 
life 
and 
being; 
according 
to 
that 
memorable 
speech 
of 
Pompeius 
Magnus, 
when 
being 
in 
commission 
of 
purveyance 
for 
a 
famine 
at 
Rome, 
and 
being 
dissuaded 
with 
great 
vehemency 
and 
instance 
by 
his 
friends 
about 
him, 
that 
he 
should 
not 
hazard 
himself 
to 
sea 
in 
an 
extremity 
of 
weather, 
he 
said 
only 
to 
them, 
Necesse 
est 
ut 
eam, 
non 
ut 
vivam. 
But 
it 
may 
be 
truly 
affirmed 
that 
there 
was 
never 
any 
philosophy, 
religion, 
or 
other 
discipline, 
which 
did 
so 
plainly 
and 
highly 
exalt 
the 
good 
which 
is 
communicative, 
and 
depress 
the 
good 
which 
is 
private 
and 
particular, 
as 
the 
Holy 
Faith; 
well 
declaring 
that 
it 
was 
the 
same 

God 
that 
gave 
the 
Christian 
law 
to 
men, 
who 
gave 
those 
laws 
of 
nature 
to 
inanimate 
creatures 
that 
we 
spake 
of 
before; 
for 
we 
read 
that 
the 
elected 
saints 
of 
God 
have 
wished 
themselves 
anathematised 
and 
razed 
out 
of 
the 
book 
of 
life, 
in 
an 
ecstasy 
of 
charity 
and 
infinite 
feeling 
of 
communion. 


(8) 
This 
being 
set 
down 
and 
strongly 
planted, 
doth 
judge 
and 
determine 
most 
of 
the 
controversies 
wherein 
moral 
philosophy 
is 
conversant. 
For 
first, 
it 
decideth 
the 
question 
touching 
the 
preferment 
of 
the 
contemplative 
or 
active 
life, 
and 
decideth 
it 
against 
Aristotle. 
For 
all 
the 
reasons 
which 
he 
bringeth 
for 
the 
contemplative 
are 
private, 
and 
respecting 
the 
pleasure 
and 
dignity 
of 
a 
man’s 
self 
(in 
which 
respects 
no 
question 
the 
contemplative 
life 
hath 
the 
pre-eminence), 
not 
much 
unlike 
to 
that 
comparison 
which 
Pythagoras 
made 
for 
the 
gracing 
and 
magnifying 
of 
philosophy 
and 
contemplation, 
who 
being 
asked 
what 
he 
was, 
answered, 
“That 
if 
Hiero 
were 
ever 
at 
the 
Olympian 
games, 
he 
knew 
the 
manner, 
that 
some 
came 
to 
try 
their 
fortune 
for 
the 
prizes, 
and 
some 
came 
as 
merchants 
to 
utter 
their 
commodities, 
and 
some 
came 
to 
make 
good 
cheer 
and 
meet 
their 
friends, 
and 
some 
came 
to 
look 
on; 
and 
that 
he 
was 
one 
of 
them 
that 
came 
to 
look 
on.” 
But 
men 
must 
know, 
that 
in 
this 
theatre 
of 
man’s 
life 
it 
is 
reserved 
only 
for 
God 
and 
angels 
to 
be 
lookers 
on. 
Neither 
could 
the 
like 
question 
ever 
have 
been 
received 
in 
the 
Church, 
notwithstanding 
their 
Pretiosa 
in 
oculis 
Domini 
mors 
sanctorum 
ejus, 
by 
which 
place 
they 
would 
exalt 
their 
civil 
death 
and 
regular 
professions, 
but 
upon 
this 
defence, 
that 
the 
monastical 
life 
is 
not 
simple 
contemplative, 
but 
performeth 
the 
duty 
either 
of 
incessant 
prayers 
and 
supplications, 
which 
hath 
been 
truly 
esteemed 
as 
an 
office 
in 
the 
Church, 
or 
else 
of 
writing 
or 
taking 
instructions 
for 
writing 
concerning 
the 
law 
of 
God, 
as 
Moses 
did 
when 
he 
abode 
so 
long 
in 
the 
mount. 
And 
so 
we 
see 
Enoch, 
the 
seventh 
from 
Adam, 
who 
was 
the 
first 
contemplative 
and 
walked 
with 
God, 
yet 
did 
also 
endow 
the 
Church 
with 
prophecy, 
which 
Saint 
Jude 
citeth. 
But 
for 
contemplation 
which 
should 
be 
finished 
in 
itself, 
without 
casting 
beams 
upon 
society, 
assuredly 
divinity 
knoweth 
it 
not. 
(9) 
It 
decideth 
also 
the 
controversies 
between 
Zeno 
and 
Socrates, 
and 
their 
schools 
and 
successions, 
on 
the 
one 
side, 
who 
placed 
felicity 
in 
virtue 
simply 
or 
attended, 
the 
actions 
and 
exercises 
whereof 
do 
chiefly 
embrace 
and 
concern 
society; 
and 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
the 
Cyrenaics 
and 
Epicureans, 
who 
placed 
it 
in 
pleasure, 
and 
made 
virtue 
(as 
it 
is 
used 
in 
some 
comedies 
of 
errors, 
wherein 
the 
mistress 
and 
the 
maid 
change 
habits) 
to 
be 

but 
as 
a 
servant, 
without 
which 
pleasure 
cannot 
be 
served 
and 
attended; 
and 
the 
reformed 
school 
of 
the 
Epicureans, 
which 
placed 
it 
in 
serenity 
of 
mind 
and 
freedom 
from 
perturbation; 
as 
if 
they 
would 
have 
deposed 
Jupiter 
again, 
and 
restored 
Saturn 
and 
the 
first 
age, 
when 
there 
was 
no 
summer 
nor 
winter, 
spring 
nor 
autumn, 
but 
all 
after 
one 
air 
and 
season; 
and 
Herillus, 
which 
placed 
felicity 
in 
extinguishment 
of 
the 
disputes 
of 
the 
mind, 
making 
no 
fixed 
nature 
of 
good 
and 
evil, 
esteeming 
things 
according 
to 
the 
clearness 
of 
the 
desires, 
or 
the 
reluctation; 
which 
opinion 
was 
revived 
in 
the 
heresy 
of 
the 
Anabaptists, 
measuring 
things 
according 
to 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
spirit, 
and 
the 
constancy 
or 
wavering 
of 
belief; 
all 
which 
are 
manifest 
to 
tend 
to 
private 
repose 
and 
contentment, 
and 
not 
to 
point 
of 
society. 


(10) 
It 
censureth 
also 
the 
philosophy 
of 
Epictetus, 
which 
presupposeth 
that 
felicity 
must 
be 
placed 
in 
those 
things 
which 
are 
in 
our 
power, 
lest 
we 
be 
liable 
to 
fortune 
and 
disturbance; 
as 
if 
it 
were 
not 
a 
thing 
much 
more 
happy 
to 
fail 
in 
good 
and 
virtuous 
ends 
for 
the 
public, 
than 
to 
obtain 
all 
that 
we 
can 
wish 
to 
ourselves 
in 
our 
proper 
fortune: 
as 
Consalvo 
said 
to 
his 
soldiers, 
showing 
them 
Naples, 
and 
protesting 
he 
had 
rather 
die 
one 
foot 
forwards, 
than 
to 
have 
his 
life 
secured 
for 
long 
by 
one 
foot 
of 
retreat. 
Whereunto 
the 
wisdom 
of 
that 
heavenly 
leader 
hath 
signed, 
who 
hath 
affirmed 
that 
“a 
good 
conscience 
is 
a 
continual 
feast;” 
showing 
plainly 
that 
the 
conscience 
of 
good 
intentions, 
howsoever 
succeeding, 
is 
a 
more 
continual 
joy 
to 
nature 
than 
all 
the 
provision 
which 
can 
be 
made 
for 
security 
and 
repose. 
(11) 
It 
censureth 
likewise 
that 
abuse 
of 
philosophy 
which 
grew 
general 
about 
the 
time 
of 
Epictetus, 
in 
converting 
it 
into 
an 
occupation 
or 
profession; 
as 
if 
the 
purpose 
had 
been, 
not 
to 
resist 
and 
extinguish 
perturbations, 
but 
to 
fly 
and 
avoid 
the 
causes 
of 
them, 
and 
to 
shape 
a 
particular 
kind 
and 
course 
of 
life 
to 
that 
end; 
introducing 
such 
a 
health 
of 
mind, 
as 
was 
that 
health 
of 
body 
of 
which 
Aristotle 
speaketh 
of 
Herodicus, 
who 
did 
nothing 
all 
his 
life 
long 
but 
intend 
his 
health; 
whereas 
if 
men 
refer 
themselves 
to 
duties 
of 
society, 
as 
that 
health 
of 
body 
is 
best 
which 
is 
ablest 
to 
endure 
all 
alterations 
and 
extremities, 
so 
likewise 
that 
health 
of 
mind 
is 
most 
proper 
which 
can 
go 
through 
the 
greatest 
temptations 
and 
perturbations. 
So 
as 
Diogenes’ 
opinion 
is 
to 
be 
accepted, 
who 
commended 
not 
them 
which 
abstained, 
but 
them 
which 
sustained, 
and 
could 
refrain 
their 
mind 
in 
praecipitio, 
and 
could 
give 
unto 
the 
mind 
(as 
is 
used 
in 
horsemanship) 
the 

shortest 
stop 
or 
turn. 


(12) 
Lastly, 
it 
censureth 
the 
tenderness 
and 
want 
of 
application 
in 
some 
of 
the 
most 
ancient 
and 
reverend 
philosophers 
and 
philosophical 
men, 
that 
did 
retire 
too 
easily 
from 
civil 
business, 
for 
avoiding 
of 
indignities 
and 
perturbations; 
whereas 
the 
resolution 
of 
men 
truly 
moral 
ought 
to 
be 
such 
as 
the 
same 
Consalvo 
said 
the 
honour 
of 
a 
soldier 
should 
be, 
e 
tela 
crassiore, 
and 
not 
so 
fine 
as 
that 
everything 
should 
catch 
in 
it 
and 
endanger 
it. 
XXI 


(1) 
To 
resume 
private 
or 
particular 
good, 
it 
falleth 
into 
the 
division 
of 
good 
active 
and 
passive; 
for 
this 
difference 
of 
good 
(not 
unlike 
to 
that 
which 
amongst 
the 
Romans 
was 
expressed 
in 
the 
familiar 
or 
household 
terms 
of 
promus 
and 
condus) 
is 
formed 
also 
in 
all 
things, 
and 
is 
best 
disclosed 
in 
the 
two 
several 
appetites 
in 
creatures; 
the 
one 
to 
preserve 
or 
continue 
themselves, 
and 
the 
other 
to 
dilate 
or 
multiply 
themselves, 
whereof 
the 
latter 
seemeth 
to 
be 
the 
worthier; 
for 
in 
nature 
the 
heavens, 
which 
are 
the 
more 
worthy, 
are 
the 
agent, 
and 
the 
earth, 
which 
is 
the 
less 
worthy, 
is 
the 
patient. 
In 
the 
pleasures 
of 
living 
creatures, 
that 
of 
generation 
is 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
food. 
In 
divine 
doctrine, 
beatius 
est 
dare 
quam 
accipere. 
And 
in 
life, 
there 
is 
no 
man’s 
spirit 
so 
soft, 
but 
esteemeth 
the 
effecting 
of 
somewhat 
that 
he 
hath 
fixed 
in 
his 
desire, 
more 
than 
sensuality, 
which 
priority 
of 
the 
active 
good 
is 
much 
upheld 
by 
the 
consideration 
of 
our 
estate 
to 
be 
mortal 
and 
exposed 
to 
fortune. 
For 
if 
we 
might 
have 
a 
perpetuity 
and 
certainty 
in 
our 
pleasures, 
the 
state 
of 
them 
would 
advance 
their 
price. 
But 
when 
we 
see 
it 
is 
but 
magni 
aestimamus 
mori 
tardius, 
and 
ne 
glorieris 
de 
crastino, 
nescis 
partum 
diei, 
it 
maketh 
us 
to 
desire 
to 
have 
somewhat 
secured 
and 
exempted 
from 
time, 
which 
are 
only 
our 
deeds 
and 
works; 
as 
it 
is 
said, 
Opera 
eorum 
sequuntur 
eos. 
The 
pre-eminence 
likewise 
of 
this 
active 
good 
is 
upheld 
by 
the 
affection 
which 
is 
natural 
in 
man 
towards 
variety 
and 
proceeding, 
which 
in 
the 
pleasures 
of 
the 
sense, 
which 
is 
the 
principal 
part 
of 
passive 
good, 
can 
have 
no 
great 
latitude. 
Cogita 
quamdiu 
eadem 
feceris; 
cibus, 
somnus, 
ludus 
per 
hunc 
circulum 
curritur; 
mori 
velle 
non 
tantum 
fortis, 
aut 
miser, 
aut 
prudens, 
sed 
etiam 
fastidiosus 
potest. 
But 
in 
enterprises, 
pursuits, 
and 
purposes 
of 
life, 

there 
is 
much 
variety; 
whereof 
men 
are 
sensible 
with 
pleasure 
in 
their 
inceptions, 
progressions, 
recoils, 
reintegrations, 
approaches 
and 
attainings 
to 
their 
ends. 
So 
as 
it 
was 
well 
said, 
Vita 
sine 
proposito 
languida 
et 
vaga 
est. 
Neither 
hath 
this 
active 
good 
an 
identity 
with 
the 
good 
of 
society, 
though 
in 
some 
cases 
it 
hath 
an 
incidence 
into 
it. 
For 
although 
it 
do 
many 
times 
bring 
forth 
acts 
of 
beneficence, 
yet 
it 
is 
with 
a 
respect 
private 
to 
a 
man’s 
own 
power, 
glory, 
amplification, 
continuance; 
as 
appeareth 
plainly, 
when 
it 
findeth 
a 
contrary 
subject. 
For 
that 
gigantine 
state 
of 
mind 
which 
possesseth 
the 
troublers 
of 
the 
world, 
such 
as 
was 
Lucius 
Sylla 
and 
infinite 
other 
in 
smaller 
model, 
who 
would 
have 
all 
men 
happy 
or 
unhappy 
as 
they 
were 
their 
friends 
or 
enemies, 
and 
would 
give 
form 
to 
the 
world, 
according 
to 
their 
own 
humours 
(which 
is 
the 
true 
theomachy), 
pretendeth 
and 
aspireth 
to 
active 
good, 
though 
it 
recedeth 
furthest 
from 
good 
of 
society, 
which 
we 
have 
determined 
to 
be 
the 
greater. 


(2) 
To 
resume 
passive 
good, 
it 
receiveth 
a 
subdivision 
of 
conservative 
and 
effective. 
For 
let 
us 
take 
a 
brief 
review 
of 
that 
which 
we 
have 
said: 
we 
have 
spoken 
first 
of 
the 
good 
of 
society, 
the 
intention 
whereof 
embraceth 
the 
form 
of 
human 
nature, 
whereof 
we 
are 
members 
and 
portions, 
and 
not 
our 
own 
proper 
and 
individual 
form; 
we 
have 
spoken 
of 
active 
good, 
and 
supposed 
it 
as 
a 
part 
of 
private 
and 
particular 
good. 
And 
rightly, 
for 
there 
is 
impressed 
upon 
all 
things 
a 
triple 
desire 
or 
appetite 
proceeding 
from 
love 
to 
themselves: 
one 
of 
preserving 
and 
continuing 
their 
form; 
another 
of 
advancing 
and 
perfecting 
their 
form; 
and 
a 
third 
of 
multiplying 
and 
extending 
their 
form 
upon 
other 
things: 
whereof 
the 
multiplying, 
or 
signature 
of 
it 
upon 
other 
things, 
is 
that 
which 
we 
handled 
by 
the 
name 
of 
active 
good. 
So 
as 
there 
remaineth 
the 
conserving 
of 
it, 
and 
perfecting 
or 
raising 
of 
it, 
which 
latter 
is 
the 
highest 
degree 
of 
passive 
good. 
For 
to 
preserve 
in 
state 
is 
the 
less, 
to 
preserve 
with 
advancement 
is 
the 
greater. 
So 
in 
man, 
“Igneus 
est 
ollis 
vigor, 
et 
caelestis 
origo.” 


His 
approach 
or 
assumption 
to 
divine 
or 
angelical 
nature 
is 
the 
perfection 
of 
his 
form; 
the 
error 
or 
false 
imitation 
of 
which 
good 
is 
that 
which 
is 
the 
tempest 
of 
human 
life; 
while 
man, 
upon 
the 
instinct 
of 
an 
advancement, 
formal 
and 
essential, 
is 
carried 
to 
seek 
an 
advancement 
local. 
For 
as 
those 
which 
are 
sick, 
and 
find 
no 
remedy, 
do 
tumble 
up 
and 
down 
and 
change 
place, 
as 
if 
by 
a 
remove 
local 
they 
could 
obtain 
a 
remove 
internal, 
so 
is 
it 
with 
men 
in 
ambition, 
when 
failing 
of 
the 
mean 
to 
exalt 
their 
nature, 
they 
are 



in 
a 
perpetual 
estuation 
to 
exalt 
their 
place. 
So 
then 
passive 
good 
is, 
as 
was 
said, 
either 
conservative 
or 
perfective. 


(3) 
To 
resume 
the 
good 
of 
conservation 
or 
comfort, 
which 
consisteth 
in 
the 
fruition 
of 
that 
which 
is 
agreeable 
to 
our 
natures; 
it 
seemeth 
to 
be 
most 
pure 
and 
natural 
of 
pleasures, 
but 
yet 
the 
softest 
and 
lowest. 
And 
this 
also 
receiveth 
a 
difference, 
which 
hath 
neither 
been 
well 
judged 
of, 
nor 
well 
inquired; 
for 
the 
good 
of 
fruition 
or 
contentment 
is 
placed 
either 
in 
the 
sincereness 
of 
the 
fruition, 
or 
in 
the 
quickness 
and 
vigour 
of 
it; 
the 
one 
superinduced 
by 
equality, 
the 
other 
by 
vicissitude; 
the 
one 
having 
less 
mixture 
of 
evil, 
the 
other 
more 
impression 
of 
good. 
Whether 
of 
these 
is 
the 
greater 
good 
is 
a 
question 
controverted; 
but 
whether 
man’s 
nature 
may 
not 
be 
capable 
of 
both 
is 
a 
question 
not 
inquired. 
(4) 
The 
former 
question 
being 
debated 
between 
Socrates 
and 
a 
sophist, 
Socrates 
placing 
felicity 
in 
an 
equal 
and 
constant 
peace 
of 
mind, 
and 
the 
sophist 
in 
much 
desiring 
and 
much 
enjoying, 
they 
fell 
from 
argument 
to 
ill 
words: 
the 
sophist 
saying 
that 
Socrates’ 
felicity 
was 
the 
felicity 
of 
a 
block 
or 
stone; 
and 
Socrates 
saying 
that 
the 
sophist’s 
felicity 
was 
the 
felicity 
of 
one 
that 
had 
the 
itch, 
who 
did 
nothing 
but 
itch 
and 
scratch. 
And 
both 
these 
opinions 
do 
not 
want 
their 
supports. 
For 
the 
opinion 
of 
Socrates 
is 
much 
upheld 
by 
the 
general 
consent 
even 
of 
the 
epicures 
themselves, 
that 
virtue 
beareth 
a 
great 
part 
in 
felicity; 
and 
if 
so, 
certain 
it 
is, 
that 
virtue 
hath 
more 
use 
in 
clearing 
perturbations 
then 
in 
compassing 
desires. 
The 
sophist’s 
opinion 
is 
much 
favoured 
by 
the 
assertion 
we 
last 
spake 
of, 
that 
good 
of 
advancement 
is 
greater 
than 
good 
of 
simple 
preservation; 
because 
every 
obtaining 
a 
desire 
hath 
a 
show 
of 
advancement, 
as 
motion 
though 
in 
a 
circle 
hath 
a 
show 
of 
progression. 
(5) 
But 
the 
second 
question, 
decided 
the 
true 
way, 
maketh 
the 
former 
superfluous. 
For 
can 
it 
be 
doubted, 
but 
that 
there 
are 
some 
who 
take 
more 
pleasure 
in 
enjoying 
pleasures 
than 
some 
other, 
and 
yet, 
nevertheless, 
are 
less 
troubled 
with 
the 
loss 
or 
leaving 
of 
them? 
So 
as 
this 
same, 
Non 
uti 
ut 
non 
appetas, 
non 
appetere 
ut 
non 
metuas, 
sunt 
animi 
pusilli 
et 
diffidentis. 
And 
it 
seemeth 
to 
me 
that 
most 
of 
the 
doctrines 
of 
the 
philosophers 
are 
more 
fearful 
and 
cautious 
than 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
requireth. 
So 
have 
they 
increased 
the 
fear 
of 
death 
in 
offering 
to 
cure 
it. 
For 
when 
they 
would 
have 
a 
man’s 
whole 
life 
to 
be 
but 
a 
discipline 
or 
preparation 
to 
die, 
they 
must 
needs 
make 
men 
think 
that 
it 
is 
a 
terrible 
enemy, 
against 
whom 
there 
is 
no 
end 
of 
preparing. 

Better 
saith 
the 
poet:— 


“Qui 
finem 
vitae 
extremum 
inter 
munera 
ponat 
Naturae.” 


So 
have 
they 
sought 
to 
make 
men’s 
minds 
too 
uniform 
and 
harmonical, 
by 
not 
breaking 
them 
sufficiently 
to 
contrary 
motions; 
the 
reasons 
whereof 
I 
suppose 
to 
be, 
because 
they 
themselves 
were 
men 
dedicated 
to 
a 
private, 
free, 
and 
unapplied 
course 
of 
life. 
For 
as 
we 
see, 
upon 
the 
lute 
or 
like 
instrument, 
a 
ground, 
though 
it 
be 
sweet 
and 
have 
show 
of 
many 
changes, 
yet 
breaketh 
not 
the 
hand 
to 
such 
strange 
and 
hard 
stops 
and 
passages, 
as 
a 
set 
song 
or 
voluntary; 
much 
after 
the 
same 
manner 
was 
the 
diversity 
between 
a 
philosophical 
and 
civil 
life. 
And, 
therefore, 
men 
are 
to 
imitate 
the 
wisdom 
of 
jewellers: 
who, 
if 
there 
be 
a 
grain, 
or 
a 
cloud, 
or 
an 
ice 
which 
may 
be 
ground 
forth 
without 
taking 
too 
much 
of 
the 
stone, 
they 
help 
it; 
but 
if 
it 
should 
lessen 
and 
abate 
the 
stone 
too 
much, 
they 
will 
not 
meddle 
with 
it: 
so 
ought 
men 
so 
to 
procure 
serenity 
as 
they 
destroy 
not 
magnanimity. 


(6) 
Having 
therefore 
deduced 
the 
good 
of 
man 
which 
is 
private 
and 
particular, 
as 
far 
as 
seemeth 
fit, 
we 
will 
now 
return 
to 
that 
good 
of 
man 
which 
respecteth 
and 
beholdeth 
society, 
which 
we 
may 
term 
duty; 
because 
the 
term 
of 
duty 
is 
more 
proper 
to 
a 
mind 
well 
framed 
and 
disposed 
towards 
others, 
as 
the 
term 
of 
virtue 
is 
applied 
to 
a 
mind 
well 
formed 
and 
composed 
in 
itself; 
though 
neither 
can 
a 
man 
understand 
virtue 
without 
some 
relation 
to 
society, 
nor 
duty 
without 
an 
inward 
disposition. 
This 
part 
may 
seem 
at 
first 
to 
pertain 
to 
science 
civil 
and 
politic; 
but 
not 
if 
it 
be 
well 
observed. 
For 
it 
concerneth 
the 
regiment 
and 
government 
of 
every 
man 
over 
himself, 
and 
not 
over 
others. 
And 
as 
in 
architecture 
the 
direction 
of 
framing 
the 
posts, 
beams, 
and 
other 
parts 
of 
building, 
is 
not 
the 
same 
with 
the 
manner 
of 
joining 
them 
and 
erecting 
the 
building; 
and 
in 
mechanicals, 
the 
direction 
how 
to 
frame 
an 
instrument 
or 
engine 
is 
not 
the 
same 
with 
the 
manner 
of 
setting 
it 
on 
work 
and 
employing 
it; 
and 
yet, 
nevertheless, 
in 
expressing 
of 
the 
one 
you 
incidently 
express 
the 
aptness 
towards 
the 
other; 
so 
the 
doctrine 
of 
conjugation 
of 
men 
in 
society 
differeth 
from 
that 
of 
their 
conformity 
thereunto. 
(7) 
This 
part 
of 
duty 
is 
subdivided 
into 
two 
parts: 
the 
common 
duty 
of 
every 
man, 
as 
a 
man 
or 
member 
of 
a 
state; 
the 
other, 
the 
respective 
or 
special 
duty 
of 
every 
man 
in 
his 
profession, 
vocation, 
and 
place. 
The 
first 
of 
these 
is 
extant 
and 
well 
laboured, 
as 
hath 
been 
said. 
The 
second 
likewise 
I 

may 
report 
rather 
dispersed 
than 
deficient; 
which 
manner 
of 
dispersed 
writing 
in 
this 
kind 
of 
argument 
I 
acknowledge 
to 
be 
best. 
For 
who 
can 
take 
upon 
him 
to 
write 
of 
the 
proper 
duty, 
virtue, 
challenge, 
and 
right 
of 
every 
several 
vocation, 
profession, 
and 
place? 
For 
although 
sometimes 
a 
looker 
on 
may 
see 
more 
than 
a 
gamester, 
and 
there 
be 
a 
proverb 
more 
arrogant 
than 
sound, 
“That 
the 
vale 
best 
discovereth 
the 
hill;” 
yet 
there 
is 
small 
doubt 
but 
that 
men 
can 
write 
best 
and 
most 
really 
and 
materially 
in 
their 
own 
professions; 
and 
that 
the 
writing 
of 
speculative 
men 
of 
active 
matter 
for 
the 
most 
part 
doth 
seem 
to 
men 
of 
experience, 
as 
Phormio’s 
argument 
of 
the 
wars 
seemed 
to 
Hannibal, 
to 
be 
but 
dreams 
and 
dotage. 
Only 
there 
is 
one 
vice 
which 
accompanieth 
them 
that 
write 
in 
their 
own 
professions, 
that 
they 
magnify 
them 
in 
excess. 
But 
generally 
it 
were 
to 
be 
wished 
(as 
that 
which 
would 
make 
learning 
indeed 
solid 
and 
fruitful) 
that 
active 
men 
would 
or 
could 
become 
writers. 


(8) 
In 
which 
kind 
I 
cannot 
but 
mention, 
honoris 
causa, 
your 
Majesty’s 
excellent 
book 
touching 
the 
duty 
of 
a 
king; 
a 
work 
richly 
compounded 
of 
divinity, 
morality, 
and 
policy, 
with 
great 
aspersion 
of 
all 
other 
arts; 
and 
being 
in 
some 
opinion 
one 
of 
the 
most 
sound 
and 
healthful 
writings 
that 
I 
have 
read: 
not 
distempered 
in 
the 
heat 
of 
invention, 
nor 
in 
the 
coldness 
of 
negligence; 
not 
sick 
of 
dizziness, 
as 
those 
are 
who 
leese 
themselves 
in 
their 
order, 
nor 
of 
convulsions, 
as 
those 
which 
cramp 
in 
matters 
impertinent; 
not 
savouring 
of 
perfumes 
and 
paintings, 
as 
those 
do 
who 
seek 
to 
please 
the 
reader 
more 
than 
nature 
beareth; 
and 
chiefly 
well 
disposed 
in 
the 
spirits 
thereof, 
being 
agreeable 
to 
truth 
and 
apt 
for 
action; 
and 
far 
removed 
from 
that 
natural 
infirmity, 
whereunto 
I 
noted 
those 
that 
write 
in 
their 
own 
professions 
to 
be 
subject 
— 
which 
is, 
that 
they 
exalt 
it 
above 
measure. 
For 
your 
Majesty 
hath 
truly 
described, 
not 
a 
king 
of 
Assyria 
or 
Persia 
in 
their 
extern 
glory, 
but 
a 
Moses 
or 
a 
David, 
pastors 
of 
their 
people. 
Neither 
can 
I 
ever 
leese 
out 
of 
my 
remembrance 
what 
I 
heard 
your 
Majesty 
in 
the 
same 
sacred 
spirit 
of 
government 
deliver 
in 
a 
great 
cause 
of 
judicature, 
which 
was, 
“That 
kings 
ruled 
by 
their 
laws, 
as 
God 
did 
by 
the 
laws 
of 
nature; 
and 
ought 
as 
rarely 
to 
put 
in 
use 
their 
supreme 
prerogative 
as 
God 
doth 
His 
power 
of 
working 
miracles.” 
And 
yet 
notwithstanding 
in 
your 
book 
of 
a 
free 
monarchy, 
you 
do 
well 
give 
men 
to 
understand, 
that 
you 
know 
the 
plenitude 
of 
the 
power 
and 
right 
of 
a 
king, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
circle 
of 
his 
office 
and 
duty. 
Thus 
have 
I 
presumed 
to 
allege 
this 
excellent 
writing 
of 
your 
Majesty, 
as 
a 
prime 
or 
eminent 
example 
of 
tractates 
concerning 
special 
and 
respective 

duties; 
wherein 
I 
should 
have 
said 
as 
much, 
if 
it 
had 
been 
written 
a 
thousand 
years 
since. 
Neither 
am 
I 
moved 
with 
certain 
courtly 
decencies, 
which 
esteem 
it 
flattery 
to 
praise 
in 
presence. 
No, 
it 
is 
flattery 
to 
praise 
in 
absence 
— 
that 
is, 
when 
either 
the 
virtue 
is 
absent, 
or 
the 
occasion 
is 
absent; 
and 
so 
the 
praise 
is 
not 
natural, 
but 
forced, 
either 
in 
truth 
or 
in 
time. 
But 
let 
Cicero 
be 
read 
in 
his 
oration 
pro 
Marcello, 
which 
is 
nothing 
but 
an 
excellent 
table 
of 
Caesar’s 
virtue, 
and 
made 
to 
his 
face; 
besides 
the 
example 
of 
many 
other 
excellent 
persons, 
wiser 
a 
great 
deal 
than 
such 
observers; 
and 
we 
will 
never 
doubt, 
upon 
a 
full 
occasion, 
to 
give 
just 
praises 
to 
present 
or 
absent. 


(9) 
But 
to 
return; 
there 
belongeth 
further 
to 
the 
handling 
of 
this 
part, 
touching 
the 
duties 
of 
professions 
and 
vocations, 
a 
relative 
or 
opposite, 
touching 
the 
frauds, 
cautels, 
impostures, 
and 
vices 
of 
every 
profession, 
which 
hath 
been 
likewise 
handled; 
but 
how? 
rather 
in 
a 
satire 
and 
cynically, 
than 
seriously 
and 
wisely; 
for 
men 
have 
rather 
sought 
by 
wit 
to 
deride 
and 
traduce 
much 
of 
that 
which 
is 
good 
in 
professions, 
than 
with 
judgment 
to 
discover 
and 
sever 
that 
which 
is 
corrupt. 
For, 
as 
Solomon 
saith, 
he 
that 
cometh 
to 
seek 
after 
knowledge 
with 
a 
mind 
to 
scorn 
and 
censure 
shall 
be 
sure 
to 
find 
matter 
for 
his 
humour, 
but 
no 
matter 
for 
his 
instruction: 
Quaerenti 
derisori 
scientiam 
ipsa 
se 
abscondit; 
sed 
studioso 
fit 
obviam. 
But 
the 
managing 
of 
this 
argument 
with 
integrity 
and 
truth, 
which 
I 
note 
as 
deficient, 
seemeth 
to 
me 
to 
be 
one 
of 
the 
best 
fortifications 
for 
honesty 
and 
virtue 
that 
can 
be 
planted. 
For, 
as 
the 
fable 
goeth 
of 
the 
basilisk 
— 
that 
if 
he 
see 
you 
first, 
you 
die 
for 
it; 
but 
if 
you 
see 
him 
first, 
he 
dieth 
— 
so 
is 
it 
with 
deceits 
and 
evil 
arts, 
which, 
if 
they 
be 
first 
espied 
they 
leese 
their 
life; 
but 
if 
they 
prevent, 
they 
endanger. 
So 
that 
we 
are 
much 
beholden 
to 
Machiavel 
and 
others, 
that 
write 
what 
men 
do, 
and 
not 
what 
they 
ought 
to 
do. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
join 
serpentine 
wisdom 
with 
the 
columbine 
innocency, 
except 
men 
know 
exactly 
all 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
serpent; 
his 
baseness 
and 
going 
upon 
his 
belly, 
his 
volubility 
and 
lubricity, 
his 
envy 
and 
sting, 
and 
the 
rest 
— 
that 
is, 
all 
forms 
and 
natures 
of 
evil. 
For 
without 
this, 
virtue 
lieth 
open 
and 
unfenced. 
Nay, 
an 
honest 
man 
can 
do 
no 
good 
upon 
those 
that 
are 
wicked, 
to 
reclaim 
them, 
without 
the 
help 
of 
the 
knowledge 
of 
evil. 
For 
men 
of 
corrupted 
minds 
presuppose 
that 
honesty 
groweth 
out 
of 
simplicity 
of 
manners, 
and 
believing 
of 
preachers, 
schoolmasters, 
and 
men’s 
exterior 
language. 
So 
as, 
except 
you 
can 
make 
them 
perceive 
that 
you 
know 
the 
utmost 
reaches 
of 
their 
own 
corrupt 
opinions, 
they 
despise 
all 
morality. 
Non 
recipit 
stultus 
verba 
prudentiae, 
nisi 
ea 
dixeris 
quae, 
versantur 
in 
corde 
ejus. 

(10) 
Unto 
this 
part, 
touching 
respective 
duty, 
doth 
also 
appertain 
the 
duties 
between 
husband 
and 
wife, 
parent 
and 
child, 
master 
and 
servant. 
So 
likewise 
the 
laws 
of 
friendship 
and 
gratitude, 
the 
civil 
bond 
of 
companies, 
colleges, 
and 
politic 
bodies, 
of 
neighbourhood, 
and 
all 
other 
proportionate 
duties; 
not 
as 
they 
are 
parts 
of 
government 
and 
society, 
but 
as 
to 
the 
framing 
of 
the 
mind 
of 
particular 
persons. 
(11) 
The 
knowledge 
concerning 
good 
respecting 
society 
doth 
handle 
it 
also, 
not 
simply 
alone, 
but 
comparatively; 
whereunto 
belongeth 
the 
weighing 
of 
duties 
between 
person 
and 
person, 
case 
and 
case, 
particular 
and 
public. 
As 
we 
see 
in 
the 
proceeding 
of 
Lucius 
Brutus 
against 
his 
own 
sons, 
which 
was 
so 
much 
extolled, 
yet 
what 
was 
said? 
“Infelix, 
utcunque 
ferent 
ea 
fata 
minores.” 


So 
the 
case 
was 
doubtful, 
and 
had 
opinion 
on 
both 
sides. 
Again, 
we 
see 
when 
M. 
Brutus 
and 
Cassius 
invited 
to 
a 
supper 
certain 
whose 
opinions 
they 
meant 
to 
feel, 
whether 
they 
were 
fit 
to 
be 
made 
their 
associates, 
and 
cast 
forth 
the 
question 
touching 
the 
killing 
of 
a 
tyrant 
being 
a 
usurper, 
they 
were 
divided 
in 
opinion; 
some 
holding 
that 
servitude 
was 
the 
extreme 
of 
evils, 
and 
others 
that 
tyranny 
was 
better 
than 
a 
civil 
war: 
and 
a 
number 
of 
the 
like 
cases 
there 
are 
of 
comparative 
duty. 
Amongst 
which 
that 
of 
all 
others 
is 
the 
most 
frequent, 
where 
the 
question 
is 
of 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
good 
to 
ensue 
of 
a 
small 
injustice. 
Which 
Jason 
of 
Thessalia 
determined 
against 
the 
truth: 
Aliqua 
sunt 
injuste 
facienda, 
ut 
multa 
juste 
fieri 
possint. 
But 
the 
reply 
is 
good: 
Auctorem 
praesentis 
justitiae 
habes, 
sponsorem 
futurae 
non 
habes. 
Men 
must 
pursue 
things 
which 
are 
just 
in 
present, 
and 
leave 
the 
future 
to 
the 
Divine 
Providence. 
So 
then 
we 
pass 
on 
from 
this 
general 
part 
touching 
the 
exemplar 
and 
description 
of 
good. 


XXII 


(1) 
Now, 
therefore, 
that 
we 
have 
spoken 
of 
this 
fruit 
of 
life, 
it 
remaineth 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
husbandry 
that 
belongeth 
thereunto, 
without 
which 
part 
the 
former 
seemeth 
to 
be 
no 
better 
than 
a 
fair 
image 
or 
statue, 
which 
is 
beautiful 
to 
contemplate, 
but 
is 
without 
life 
and 
motion; 
whereunto 
Aristotle 

himself 
subscribeth 
in 
these 
words: 
Necesse 
est 
scilicet 
de 
virtute 
dicere, 
et 
quid 
sit, 
et 
ex 
quibus 
gignatur. 
Inutile 
enum 
fere 
fuerit 
virtutem 
quidem 
nosse, 
acquirendae 
autem 
ejus 
modos 
et 
vias 
ignorare. 
Non 
enum 
de 
virtute 
tantum, 
qua 
specie 
sit, 
quaerendum 
est, 
sed 
et 
quomodo 
sui 
copiam 
faciat: 
utrumque 
enum 
volumeus, 
et 
rem 
ipsam 
nosse, 
et 
ejus 
compotes 
fieri: 
hoc 
autem 
ex 
voto 
non 
succedet, 
nisi 
sciamus 
et 
ex 
quibus 
et 
quomodo. 
In 
such 
full 
words 
and 
with 
such 
iteration 
doth 
he 
inculcate 
this 
part. 
So 
saith 
Cicero 
in 
great 
commendation 
of 
Cato 
the 
second, 
that 
he 
had 
applied 
himself 
to 
philosophy, 
Non 
ita 
disputandi 
causa, 
sed 
ita 
vivendi. 
And 
although 
the 
neglect 
of 
our 
times, 
wherein 
few 
men 
do 
hold 
any 
consultations 
touching 
the 
reformation 
of 
their 
life 
(as 
Seneca 
excellently 
saith, 
De 
partibus 
vitae 
quisque 
deliberat, 
de 
summa 
nemo), 
may 
make 
this 
part 
seem 
superfluous; 
yet 
I 
must 
conclude 
with 
that 
aphorism 
of 
Hippocrates, 
Qui 
gravi 
morbo 
correpti 
dolores 
non 
sentiunt, 
iis 
mens 
aegrotat. 
They 
need 
medicine, 
not 
only 
to 
assuage 
the 
disease, 
but 
to 
awake 
the 
sense. 
And 
if 
it 
be 
said 
that 
the 
cure 
of 
men’s 
minds 
belongeth 
to 
sacred 
divinity, 
it 
is 
most 
true; 
but 
yet 
moral 
philosophy 
may 
be 
preferred 
unto 
her 
as 
a 
wise 
servant 
and 
humble 
handmaid. 
For 
as 
the 
Psalm 
saith, 
“That 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
handmaid 
look 
perpetually 
towards 
the 
mistress,” 
and 
yet 
no 
doubt 
many 
things 
are 
left 
to 
the 
discretion 
of 
the 
handmaid 
to 
discern 
of 
the 
mistress’ 
will; 
so 
ought 
moral 
philosophy 
to 
give 
a 
constant 
attention 
to 
the 
doctrines 
of 
divinity, 
and 
yet 
so 
as 
it 
may 
yield 
of 
herself 
(within 
due 
limits) 
many 
sound 
and 
profitable 
directions. 


(2) 
This 
part, 
therefore, 
because 
of 
the 
excellency 
thereof, 
I 
cannot 
but 
find 
exceeding 
strange 
that 
it 
is 
not 
reduced 
to 
written 
inquiry; 
the 
rather, 
because 
it 
consisteth 
of 
much 
matter, 
wherein 
both 
speech 
and 
action 
is 
often 
conversant; 
and 
such 
wherein 
the 
common 
talk 
of 
men 
(which 
is 
rare, 
but 
yet 
cometh 
sometimes 
to 
pass) 
is 
wiser 
than 
their 
books. 
It 
is 
reasonable, 
therefore, 
that 
we 
propound 
it 
in 
the 
more 
particularity, 
both 
for 
the 
worthiness, 
and 
because 
we 
may 
acquit 
ourselves 
for 
reporting 
it 
deficient, 
which 
seemeth 
almost 
incredible, 
and 
is 
otherwise 
conceived 
and 
presupposed 
by 
those 
themselves 
that 
have 
written. 
We 
will, 
therefore, 
enumerate 
some 
heads 
or 
points 
thereof, 
that 
it 
may 
appear 
the 
better 
what 
it 
is, 
and 
whether 
it 
be 
extant. 
(3) 
First, 
therefore, 
in 
this, 
as 
in 
all 
things 
which 
are 
practical 
we 
ought 
to 
cast 
up 
our 
account, 
what 
is 
in 
our 
power, 
and 
what 
not; 
for 
the 
one 

may 
be 
dealt 
with 
by 
way 
of 
alteration, 
but 
the 
other 
by 
way 
of 
application 
only. 
The 
husbandman 
cannot 
command 
neither 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
earth 
nor 
the 
seasons 
of 
the 
weather; 
no 
more 
can 
the 
physician 
the 
constitution 
of 
the 
patient 
nor 
the 
variety 
of 
accidents. 
So 
in 
the 
culture 
and 
cure 
of 
the 
mind 
of 
man, 
two 
things 
are 
without 
our 
command: 
points 
of 
Nature, 
and 
points 
of 
fortune. 
For 
to 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
one, 
and 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
other, 
our 
work 
is 
limited 
and 
tied. 
In 
these 
things, 
therefore, 
it 
is 
left 
unto 
us 
to 
proceed 
by 
application 


“Vincenda 
est 
omnis 
fertuna 
ferendo:” 


and 
so 
likewise, 


“Vincenda 
est 
omnis 
Natura 
ferendo.” 


But 
when 
that 
we 
speak 
of 
suffering, 
we 
do 
not 
speak 
of 
a 
dull 
and 
neglected 
suffering, 
but 
of 
a 
wise 
and 
industrious 
suffering, 
which 
draweth 
and 
contriveth 
use 
and 
advantage 
out 
of 
that 
which 
seemeth 
adverse 
and 
contrary; 
which 
is 
that 
properly 
which 
we 
call 
accommodating 
or 
applying. 
Now 
the 
wisdom 
of 
application 
resteth 
principally 
in 
the 
exact 
and 
distinct 
knowledge 
of 
the 
precedent 
state 
or 
disposition, 
unto 
which 
we 
do 
apply; 
for 
we 
cannot 
fit 
a 
garment 
except 
we 
first 
take 
measure 
of 
the 
body. 


(4) 
So, 
then, 
the 
first 
article 
of 
this 
knowledge 
is 
to 
set 
down 
sound 
and 
true 
distributions 
and 
descriptions 
of 
the 
several 
characters 
and 
tempers 
of 
men’s 
natures 
and 
dispositions, 
specially 
having 
regard 
to 
those 
differences 
which 
are 
most 
radical 
in 
being 
the 
fountains 
and 
causes 
of 
the 
rest, 
or 
most 
frequent 
in 
concurrence 
or 
commixture; 
wherein 
it 
is 
not 
the 
handling 
of 
a 
few 
of 
them 
in 
passage, 
the 
better 
to 
describe 
the 
mediocrities 
of 
virtues, 
that 
can 
satisfy 
this 
intention. 
For 
if 
it 
deserve 
to 
be 
considered, 
that 
there 
are 
minds 
which 
are 
proportioned 
to 
great 
matters, 
and 
others 
to 
small 
(which 
Aristotle 
handleth, 
or 
ought 
to 
have 
bandied, 
by 
the 
name 
of 
magnanimity), 
doth 
it 
not 
deserve 
as 
well 
to 
be 
considered 
that 
there 
are 
minds 
proportioned 
to 
intend 
many 
matters, 
and 
others 
to 
few? 
So 
that 
some 
can 
divide 
themselves: 
others 
can 
perchance 
do 
exactly 
well, 
but 
it 
must 
be 
but 
in 
few 
things 
at 
once; 
and 
so 
there 
cometh 
to 
be 
a 
narrowness 
of 
mind, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
pusillanimity. 
And 
again, 
that 
some 
minds 
are 
proportioned 
to 
that 
which 
may 
be 
dispatched 
at 
once, 
or 
within 
a 
short 
return 
of 
time; 
others 
to 
that 
which 
begins 
afar 
off, 
and 
is 
to 
be 
won 
with 
length 
of 
pursuit:— 

“Jam 
tum 
tenditqus 
fovetque.” 


So 
that 
there 
may 
be 
fitly 
said 
to 
be 
a 
longanimity, 
which 
is 
commonly 
also 
ascribed 
to 
God 
as 
a 
magnanimity. 
So 
further 
deserved 
it 
to 
be 
considered 
by 
Aristotle, 
“That 
there 
is 
a 
disposition 
in 
conversation 
(supposing 
it 
in 
things 
which 
do 
in 
no 
sort 
touch 
or 
concern 
a 
man’s 
self) 
to 
soothe 
and 
please, 
and 
a 
disposition 
contrary 
to 
contradict 
and 
cross;” 
and 
deserveth 
it 
not 
much 
better 
to 
be 
considered. 
“That 
there 
is 
a 
disposition, 
not 
in 
conversation 
or 
talk, 
but 
in 
matter 
of 
more 
serious 
nature 
(and 
supposing 
it 
still 
in 
things 
merely 
indifferent), 
to 
take 
pleasure 
in 
the 
good 
of 
another; 
and 
a 
disposition 
contrariwise, 
to 
take 
distaste 
at 
the 
good 
of 
another?” 
which 
is 
that 
properly 
which 
we 
call 
good 
nature 
or 
ill 
nature, 
benignity 
or 
malignity; 
and, 
therefore, 
I 
cannot 
sufficiently 
marvel 
that 
this 
part 
of 
knowledge, 
touching 
the 
several 
characters 
of 
natures 
and 
dispositions, 
should 
be 
omitted 
both 
in 
morality 
and 
policy, 
considering 
it 
is 
of 
so 
great 
ministry 
and 
suppeditation 
to 
them 
both. 
A 
man 
shall 
find 
in 
the 
traditions 
of 
astrology 
some 
pretty 
and 
apt 
divisions 
of 
men’s 
natures, 
according 
to 
the 
predominances 
of 
the 
planets: 
lovers 
of 
quiet, 
lovers 
of 
action, 
lovers 
of 
victory, 
lovers 
of 
honour, 
lovers 
of 
pleasure, 
lovers 
of 
arts, 
lovers 
of 
change, 
and 
so 
forth. 
A 
man 
shall 
find 
in 
the 
wisest 
sort 
of 
these 
relations 
which 
the 
Italians 
make 
touching 
conclaves, 
the 
natures 
of 
the 
several 
cardinals 
handsomely 
and 
lively 
painted 
forth. 
A 
man 
shall 
meet 
with 
in 
every 
day’s 
conference 
the 
denominations 
of 
sensitive, 
dry, 
formal, 
real, 
humorous, 
certain, 
huomo 
di 
prima 
impressione, 
huomo 
di 
ultima 
impressione, 
and 
the 
like; 
and 
yet, 
nevertheless, 
this 
kind 
of 
observations 
wandereth 
in 
words, 
but 
is 
not 
fixed 
in 
inquiry. 
For 
the 
distinctions 
are 
found 
(many 
of 
them), 
but 
we 
conclude 
no 
precepts 
upon 
them: 
wherein 
our 
fault 
is 
the 
greater, 
because 
both 
history, 
poesy, 
and 
daily 
experience 
are 
as 
goodly 
fields 
where 
these 
observations 
grow; 
whereof 
we 
make 
a 
few 
posies 
to 
hold 
in 
our 
hands, 
but 
no 
man 
bringeth 
them 
to 
the 
confectionary 
that 
receipts 
might 
be 
made 
of 
them 
for 
use 
of 
life. 


(5) 
Of 
much 
like 
kind 
are 
those 
impressions 
of 
Nature, 
which 
are 
imposed 
upon 
the 
mind 
by 
the 
sex, 
by 
the 
age, 
by 
the 
region, 
by 
health 
and 
sickness, 
by 
beauty 
and 
deformity, 
and 
the 
like, 
which 
are 
inherent 
and 
not 
extern; 
and 
again, 
those 
which 
are 
caused 
by 
extern 
fortune, 
as 
sovereignty, 
nobility, 
obscure 
birth, 
riches, 
want, 
magistracy, 
privateness, 
prosperity, 
adversity, 
constant 
fortune, 
variable 
fortune, 
rising 
per 
saltum, 
per 
gradus, 

and 
the 
like. 
And, 
therefore, 
we 
see 
that 
Plautus 
maketh 
it 
a 
wonder 
to 
see 
an 
old 
man 
beneficent, 
benignitas 
hujis 
ut 
adolescentuli 
est. 
Saint 
Paul 
concludeth 
that 
severity 
of 
discipline 
was 
to 
be 
used 
to 
the 
Cretans, 
increpa 
eos 
dure, 
upon 
the 
disposition 
of 
their 
country, 
Cretensus 
semper 
mendaces, 
malae 
bestiae, 
ventres. 
Sallust 
noteth 
that 
it 
is 
usual 
with 
kings 
to 
desire 
contradictories: 
Sed 
plerumque 
regiae 
voluntates, 
ut 
vehementes 
sunt, 
sic 
mobiles, 
saepeque 
ipsae 
sibi 
advers. 
Tacitus 
observeth 
how 
rarely 
raising 
of 
the 
fortune 
mendeth 
the 
disposition: 
solus 
Vespasianus 
mutatus 
in 
melius. 
Pindarus 
maketh 
an 
observation, 
that 
great 
and 
sudden 
fortune 
for 
the 
most 
part 
defeateth 
men 
qui 
magnam 
felicitatem 
concoquere 
non 
possunt. 
So 
the 
Psalm 
showeth 
it 
is 
more 
easy 
to 
keep 
a 
measure 
in 
the 
enjoying 
of 
fortune, 
than 
in 
the 
increase 
of 
fortune; 
Divitiae 
si 
affluant, 
nolite 
cor 
apponere. 
These 
observations 
and 
the 
like 
I 
deny 
not 
but 
are 
touched 
a 
little 
by 
Aristotle 
as 
in 
passage 
in 
his 
Rhetorics, 
and 
are 
handled 
in 
some 
scattered 
discourses; 
but 
they 
were 
never 
incorporate 
into 
moral 
philosophy, 
to 
which 
they 
do 
essentially 
appertain; 
as 
the 
knowledge 
of 
this 
diversity 
of 
grounds 
and 
moulds 
doth 
to 
agriculture, 
and 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
diversity 
of 
complexions 
and 
constitutions 
doth 
to 
the 
physician, 
except 
we 
mean 
to 
follow 
the 
indiscretion 
of 
empirics, 
which 
minister 
the 
same 
medicines 
to 
all 
patients. 


(6) 
Another 
article 
of 
this 
knowledge 
is 
the 
inquiry 
touching 
the 
affections; 
for 
as 
in 
medicining 
of 
the 
body, 
it 
is 
in 
order 
first 
to 
know 
the 
divers 
complexions 
and 
constitutions; 
secondly, 
the 
diseases; 
and 
lastly, 
the 
cures: 
so 
in 
medicining 
of 
the 
mind, 
after 
knowledge 
of 
the 
divers 
characters 
of 
men’s 
natures, 
it 
followeth 
in 
order 
to 
know 
the 
diseases 
and 
infirmities 
of 
the 
mind, 
which 
are 
no 
other 
than 
the 
perturbations 
and 
distempars 
of 
the 
affections. 
For 
as 
the 
ancient 
politiques 
in 
popular 
estates 
were 
wont 
to 
compare 
the 
people 
to 
the 
sea, 
and 
the 
orators 
to 
the 
winds; 
because 
as 
the 
sea 
would 
of 
itself 
be 
calm 
and 
quiet, 
if 
the 
winds 
did 
not 
move 
and 
trouble 
it; 
so 
the 
people 
would 
be 
peaceable 
and 
tractable 
if 
the 
seditious 
orators 
did 
not 
set 
them 
in 
working 
and 
agitation: 
so 
it 
may 
be 
fitly 
said, 
that 
the 
mind 
in 
the 
nature 
thereof 
would 
be 
temperate 
and 
stayed, 
if 
the 
affections, 
as 
winds, 
did 
not 
put 
it 
into 
tumult 
and 
perturbation. 
And 
here 
again 
I 
find 
strange, 
as 
before, 
that 
Aristotle 
should 
have 
written 
divers 
volumes 
of 
Ethics, 
and 
never 
handled 
the 
affections 
which 
is 
the 
principal 
subject 
thereof; 
and 
yet 
in 
his 
Rhetorics, 
where 
they 
are 
considered 
but 
collaterally 
and 
in 
a 
second 
degree 
(as 
they 
may 
be 
moved 
by 
speech), 
he 
findeth 
place 
for 
them, 
and 
handleth 

them 
well 
for 
the 
quantity; 
but 
where 
their 
true 
place 
is 
he 
pretermitteth 
them. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
his 
disputations 
about 
pleasure 
and 
pain 
that 
can 
satisfy 
this 
inquiry, 
no 
more 
than 
he 
that 
should 
generally 
handle 
the 
nature 
of 
light 
can 
be 
said 
to 
handle 
the 
nature 
of 
colours; 
for 
pleasure 
and 
pain 
are 
to 
the 
particular 
affections 
as 
light 
is 
to 
particular 
colours. 
Better 
travails, 
I 
suppose, 
had 
the 
Stoics 
taken 
in 
this 
argument, 
as 
far 
as 
I 
can 
gather 
by 
that 
which 
we 
have 
at 
second 
hand. 
But 
yet 
it 
is 
like 
it 
was 
after 
their 
manner, 
rather 
in 
subtlety 
of 
definitions 
(which 
in 
a 
subject 
of 
this 
nature 
are 
but 
curiosities), 
than 
in 
active 
and 
ample 
descriptions 
and 
observations. 
So 
likewise 
I 
find 
some 
particular 
writings 
of 
an 
elegant 
nature, 
touching 
some 
of 
the 
affections: 
as 
of 
anger, 
of 
comfort 
upon 
adverse 
accidents, 
of 
tenderness 
of 
countenance, 
and 
other. 
But 
the 
poets 
and 
writers 
of 
histories 
are 
the 
best 
doctors 
of 
this 
knowledge; 
where 
we 
may 
find 
painted 
forth, 
with 
great 
life, 
how 
affections 
are 
kindled 
and 
incited; 
and 
how 
pacified 
and 
refrained; 
and 
how 
again 
contained 
from 
act 
and 
further 
degree; 
how 
they 
disclose 
themselves; 
how 
they 
work; 
how 
they 
vary; 
how 
they 
gather 
and 
fortify: 
how 
they 
are 
enwrapped 
one 
within 
another; 
and 
how 
they 
do 
fight 
and 
encounter 
one 
with 
another; 
and 
other 
the 
like 
particularities. 
Amongst 
the 
which 
this 
last 
is 
of 
special 
use 
in 
moral 
and 
civil 
matters; 
how, 
I 
say, 
to 
set 
affection 
against 
affection, 
and 
to 
master 
one 
by 
another; 
even 
as 
we 
used 
to 
hunt 
beast 
with 
beast, 
and 
fly 
bird 
with 
bird, 
which 
otherwise 
percase 
we 
could 
not 
so 
easily 
recover: 
upon 
which 
foundation 
is 
erected 
that 
excellent 
use 
of 
praemium 
and 
paena, 
whereby 
civil 
states 
consist: 
employing 
the 
predominant 
affections 
of 
fear 
and 
hope, 
for 
the 
suppressing 
and 
bridling 
the 
rest. 
For 
as 
in 
the 
government 
of 
states 
it 
is 
sometimes 
necessary 
to 
bridle 
one 
faction 
with 
another, 
so 
it 
is 
in 
the 
government 
within. 


(7) 
Now 
come 
we 
to 
those 
points 
which 
are 
within 
our 
own 
command, 
and 
have 
force 
and 
operation 
upon 
the 
mind, 
to 
affect 
the 
will 
and 
appetite, 
and 
to 
alter 
manners: 
wherein 
they 
ought 
to 
have 
handled 
custom, 
exercise, 
habit, 
education, 
example, 
imitation, 
emulation, 
company, 
friends, 
praise, 
reproof, 
exhortation, 
fame, 
laws, 
books, 
studies: 
these 
as 
they 
have 
determinate 
use 
in 
moralities, 
from 
these 
the 
mind 
suffereth, 
and 
of 
these 
are 
such 
receipts 
and 
regiments 
compounded 
and 
described, 
as 
may 
serve 
to 
recover 
or 
preserve 
the 
health 
and 
good 
estate 
of 
the 
mind, 
as 
far 
as 
pertaineth 
to 
human 
medicine: 
of 
which 
number 
we 
will 
insist 
upon 
some 
one 
or 
two, 
as 
an 
example 
of 
the 
rest, 
because 
it 
were 
too 
long 
to 
prosecute 
all; 
and 
therefore 
we 
do 
resume 
custom 
and 
habit 
to 
speak 
of. 

(8) 
The 
opinion 
of 
Aristotle 
seemeth 
to 
me 
a 
negligent 
opinion, 
that 
of 
those 
things 
which 
consist 
by 
Nature, 
nothing 
can 
be 
changed 
by 
custom; 
using 
for 
example, 
that 
if 
a 
stone 
be 
thrown 
ten 
thousand 
times 
up 
it 
will 
not 
learn 
to 
ascend; 
and 
that 
by 
often 
seeing 
or 
hearing 
we 
do 
not 
learn 
to 
see 
or 
hear 
the 
better. 
For 
though 
this 
principle 
be 
true 
in 
things 
wherein 
Nature 
is 
peremptory 
(the 
reason 
whereof 
we 
cannot 
now 
stand 
to 
discuss), 
yet 
it 
is 
otherwise 
in 
things 
wherein 
Nature 
admitteth 
a 
latitude. 
For 
he 
might 
see 
that 
a 
strait 
glove 
will 
come 
more 
easily 
on 
with 
use; 
and 
that 
a 
wand 
will 
by 
use 
bend 
otherwise 
than 
it 
grew; 
and 
that 
by 
use 
of 
the 
voice 
we 
speak 
louder 
and 
stronger; 
and 
that 
by 
use 
of 
enduring 
heat 
or 
cold 
we 
endure 
it 
the 
better, 
and 
the 
like: 
which 
latter 
sort 
have 
a 
nearer 
resemblance 
unto 
that 
subject 
of 
manners 
he 
handleth, 
than 
those 
instances 
which 
he 
allegeth. 
But 
allowing 
his 
conclusion, 
that 
virtues 
and 
vices 
consist 
in 
habit, 
he 
ought 
so 
much 
the 
more 
to 
have 
taught 
the 
manner 
of 
superinducing 
that 
habit: 
for 
there 
be 
many 
precepts 
of 
the 
wise 
ordering 
the 
exercises 
of 
the 
mind, 
as 
there 
is 
of 
ordering 
the 
exercises 
of 
the 
body, 
whereof 
we 
will 
recite 
a 
few. 
(9) 
The 
first 
shall 
be, 
that 
we 
beware 
we 
take 
not 
at 
the 
first 
either 
too 
high 
a 
strain 
or 
too 
weak: 
for 
if 
too 
high, 
in 
a 
diffident 
nature 
you 
discourage, 
in 
a 
confident 
nature 
you 
breed 
an 
opinion 
of 
facility, 
and 
so 
a 
sloth; 
and 
in 
all 
natures 
you 
breed 
a 
further 
expectation 
than 
can 
hold 
out, 
and 
so 
an 
insatisfaction 
in 
the 
end: 
if 
too 
weak, 
of 
the 
other 
side, 
you 
may 
not 
look 
to 
perform 
and 
overcome 
any 
great 
task. 
(10) 
Another 
precept 
is 
to 
practise 
all 
things 
chiefly 
at 
two 
several 
times, 
the 
one 
when 
the 
mind 
is 
best 
disposed, 
the 
other 
when 
it 
is 
worst 
disposed; 
that 
by 
the 
one 
you 
may 
gain 
a 
great 
step, 
by 
the 
other 
you 
may 
work 
out 
the 
knots 
and 
stonds 
of 
the 
mind, 
and 
make 
the 
middle 
times 
the 
more 
easy 
and 
pleasant. 
(11) 
Another 
precept 
is 
that 
which 
Aristotle 
mentioneth 
by 
the 
way, 
which 
is 
to 
bear 
ever 
towards 
the 
contrary 
extreme 
of 
that 
whereunto 
we 
are 
by 
nature 
inclined; 
like 
unto 
the 
rowing 
against 
the 
stream, 
or 
making 
a 
wand 
straight 
by 
bending 
him 
contrary 
to 
his 
natural 
crookedness. 
(12) 
Another 
precept 
is 
that 
the 
mind 
is 
brought 
to 
anything 
better, 
and 
with 
more 
sweetness 
and 
happiness, 
if 
that 
whereunto 
you 
pretend 
be 
not 
first 
in 
the 
intention, 
but 
tanquam 
aliud 
agendo, 
because 
of 
the 
natural 
hatred 
of 
the 
mind 
against 
necessity 
and 
constraint. 
Many 
other 
axioms 
there 
are 

touching 
the 
managing 
of 
exercise 
and 
custom, 
which 
being 
so 
conducted 
doth 
prove 
indeed 
another 
nature; 
but, 
being 
governed 
by 
chance, 
doth 
commonly 
prove 
but 
an 
ape 
of 
Nature, 
and 
bringeth 
forth 
that 
which 
is 
lame 
and 
counterfeit. 


(13) 
So 
if 
we 
should 
handle 
books 
and 
studies, 
and 
what 
influence 
and 
operation 
they 
have 
upon 
manners, 
are 
there 
not 
divers 
precepts 
of 
great 
caution 
and 
direction 
appertaining 
thereunto? 
Did 
not 
one 
of 
the 
fathers 
in 
great 
indignation 
call 
poesy 
vinum 
daemonum, 
because 
it 
increaseth 
temptations, 
perturbations, 
and 
vain 
opinions? 
Is 
not 
the 
opinion 
of 
Aristotle 
worthy 
to 
be 
regarded, 
wherein 
he 
saith, 
“That 
young 
men 
are 
no 
fit 
auditors 
of 
moral 
philosophy, 
because 
they 
are 
not 
settled 
from 
the 
boiling 
heat 
of 
their 
affections, 
nor 
attempered 
with 
time 
and 
experience”? 
And 
doth 
it 
not 
hereof 
come, 
that 
those 
excellent 
books 
and 
discourses 
of 
the 
ancient 
writers 
(whereby 
they 
have 
persuaded 
unto 
virtue 
most 
effectually, 
by 
representing 
her 
in 
state 
and 
majesty, 
and 
popular 
opinions 
against 
virtue 
in 
their 
parasites’ 
coats 
fit 
to 
be 
scorned 
and 
derided), 
are 
of 
so 
little 
effect 
towards 
honesty 
of 
life, 
because 
they 
are 
not 
read 
and 
revolved 
by 
men 
in 
their 
mature 
and 
settled 
years, 
but 
confined 
almost 
to 
boys 
and 
beginners? 
But 
is 
it 
not 
true 
also, 
that 
much 
less 
young 
men 
are 
fit 
auditors 
of 
matters 
of 
policy, 
till 
they 
have 
been 
thoroughly 
seasoned 
in 
religion 
and 
morality; 
lest 
their 
judgments 
be 
corrupted, 
and 
made 
apt 
to 
think 
that 
there 
are 
no 
true 
differences 
of 
things, 
but 
according 
to 
utility 
and 
fortune, 
as 
the 
verse 
describes 
it, 
Prosperum 
et 
felix 
scelus 
virtus 
vocatur; 
and 
again, 
Ille 
crucem 
pretium 
sceleris 
tulit, 
hic 
diadema: 
which 
the 
poets 
do 
speak 
satirically 
and 
in 
indignation 
on 
virtue’s 
behalf; 
but 
books 
of 
policy 
do 
speak 
it 
seriously 
and 
positively; 
for 
so 
it 
pleaseth 
Machiavel 
to 
say, 
“That 
if 
Caesar 
had 
been 
overthrown, 
he 
would 
have 
been 
more 
odious 
than 
ever 
was 
Catiline;” 
as 
if 
there 
had 
been 
no 
difference, 
but 
in 
fortune, 
between 
a 
very 
fury 
of 
lust 
and 
blood, 
and 
the 
most 
excellent 
spirit 
(his 
ambition 
reserved) 
of 
the 
world? 
Again, 
is 
there 
not 
a 
caution 
likewise 
to 
be 
given 
of 
the 
doctrines 
of 
moralities 
themselves 
(some 
kinds 
of 
them), 
lest 
they 
make 
men 
too 
precise, 
arrogant, 
incompatible; 
as 
Cicero 
saith 
of 
Cato, 
In 
Marco 
Catone 
haec 
bona 
quae 
videmus 
divina 
et 
egregia, 
ipsius 
scitote 
esse 
propria; 
quae 
nonunquam 
requirimus 
ea 
sunt 
omnia 
non 
a 
natura, 
sed 
a 
magistro? 
Many 
other 
axioms 
and 
advices 
there 
are 
touching 
those 
proprieties 
and 
effects, 
which 
studies 
do 
infuse 
and 
instil 
into 
manners. 
And 
so, 
likewise, 
is 
there 
touching 
the 
use 
of 
all 
those 
other 
points, 
of 
company, 
fame, 
laws, 
and 
the 
rest, 
which 
we 
recited 

in 
the 
beginning 
in 
the 
doctrine 
of 
morality. 


(14) 
But 
there 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
culture 
of 
the 
mind 
that 
seemeth 
yet 
more 
accurate 
and 
elaborate 
than 
the 
rest, 
and 
is 
built 
upon 
this 
ground; 
that 
the 
minds 
of 
all 
men 
are 
at 
some 
times 
in 
a 
state 
more 
perfect, 
and 
at 
other 
times 
in 
a 
state 
more 
depraved. 
The 
purpose, 
therefore, 
of 
this 
practice 
is 
to 
fix 
and 
cherish 
the 
good 
hours 
of 
the 
mind, 
and 
to 
obliterate 
and 
take 
forth 
the 
evil. 
The 
fixing 
of 
the 
good 
hath 
been 
practised 
by 
two 
means, 
vows 
or 
constant 
resolutions, 
and 
observances 
or 
exercises; 
which 
are 
not 
to 
be 
regarded 
so 
much 
in 
themselves, 
as 
because 
they 
keep 
the 
mind 
in 
continual 
obedience. 
The 
obliteration 
of 
the 
evil 
hath 
been 
practised 
by 
two 
means, 
some 
kind 
of 
redemption 
or 
expiation 
of 
that 
which 
is 
past, 
and 
an 
inception 
or 
account 
de 
novo 
for 
the 
time 
to 
come. 
But 
this 
part 
seemeth 
sacred 
and 
religious, 
and 
justly; 
for 
all 
good 
moral 
philosophy 
(as 
was 
said) 
is 
but 
a 
handmaid 
to 
religion. 
(15) 
Wherefore 
we 
will 
conclude 
with 
that 
last 
point, 
which 
is 
of 
all 
other 
means 
the 
most 
compendious 
and 
summary, 
and 
again, 
the 
most 
noble 
and 
effectual 
to 
the 
reducing 
of 
the 
mind 
unto 
virtue 
and 
good 
estate; 
which 
is, 
the 
electing 
and 
propounding 
unto 
a 
man’s 
self 
good 
and 
virtuous 
ends 
of 
his 
life, 
such 
as 
may 
be 
in 
a 
reasonable 
sort 
within 
his 
compass 
to 
attain. 
For 
if 
these 
two 
things 
be 
supposed, 
that 
a 
man 
set 
before 
him 
honest 
and 
good 
ends, 
and 
again, 
that 
he 
be 
resolute, 
constant, 
and 
true 
unto 
them; 
it 
will 
follow 
that 
he 
shall 
mould 
himself 
into 
all 
virtue 
at 
once. 
And 
this 
indeed 
is 
like 
the 
work 
of 
nature; 
whereas 
the 
other 
course 
is 
like 
the 
work 
of 
the 
hand. 
For 
as 
when 
a 
carver 
makes 
an 
image, 
he 
shapes 
only 
that 
part 
whereupon 
he 
worketh; 
as 
if 
he 
be 
upon 
the 
face, 
that 
part 
which 
shall 
be 
the 
body 
is 
but 
a 
rude 
stone 
still, 
till 
such 
times 
as 
he 
comes 
to 
it. 
But 
contrariwise 
when 
nature 
makes 
a 
flower 
or 
living 
creature, 
she 
formeth 
rudiments 
of 
all 
the 
parts 
at 
one 
time. 
So 
in 
obtaining 
virtue 
by 
habit, 
while 
a 
man 
practiseth 
temperance, 
he 
doth 
not 
profit 
much 
to 
fortitude, 
nor 
the 
like 
but 
when 
he 
dedicateth 
and 
applieth 
himself 
to 
good 
ends, 
look, 
what 
virtue 
soever 
the 
pursuit 
and 
passage 
towards 
those 
ends 
doth 
commend 
unto 
him, 
he 
is 
invested 
of 
a 
precedent 
disposition 
to 
conform 
himself 
thereunto. 
Which 
state 
of 
mind 
Aristotle 
doth 
excellently 
express 
himself, 
that 
it 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
called 
virtuous, 
but 
divine. 
His 
words 
are 
these: 
Immanitati 
autem 
consentaneum 
est 
opponere 
eam, 
quae 
supra 
humanitatem 
est, 
heroicam 
sive 
divinam 
virtutem; 
and 
a 
little 
after, 
Nam 
ut 
ferae 
neque 
vitium 
neque 
virtus 

est, 
swic 
neque 
Dei: 
sed 
hic 
quidem 
status 
altius 
quiddam 
virtute 
est, 
ille 
aluid 
quiddam 
a 
vitio. 
And 
therefore 
we 
may 
see 
what 
celsitude 
of 
honour 
Plinius 
Secundus 
attributeth 
to 
Trajan 
in 
his 
funeral 
oration, 
where 
he 
said, 
“That 
men 
needed 
to 
make 
no 
other 
prayers 
to 
the 
gods, 
but 
that 
they 
would 
continue 
as 
good 
lords 
to 
them 
as 
Trajan 
had 
been;” 
as 
if 
he 
had 
not 
been 
only 
an 
imitation 
of 
divine 
nature, 
but 
a 
pattern 
of 
it. 
But 
these 
be 
heathen 
and 
profane 
passages, 
having 
but 
a 
shadow 
of 
that 
divine 
state 
of 
mind, 
which 
religion 
and 
the 
holy 
faith 
doth 
conduct 
men 
unto, 
by 
imprinting 
upon 
their 
souls 
charity, 
which 
is 
excellently 
called 
the 
bond 
of 
perfection, 
because 
it 
comprehendeth 
and 
fasteneth 
all 
virtues 
together. 
And 
as 
it 
is 
elegantly 
said 
by 
Menander 
of 
vain 
love, 
which 
is 
but 
a 
false 
imitation 
of 
divine 
love, 
Amor 
melior 
Sophista 
loevo 
ad 
humanam 
vitam 
— 
that 
love 
teacheth 
a 
man 
to 
carry 
himself 
better 
than 
the 
sophist 
or 
preceptor; 
which 
he 
calleth 
left-
handed, 
because, 
with 
all 
his 
rules 
and 
preceptions, 
he 
cannot 
form 
a 
man 
so 
dexterously, 
nor 
with 
that 
facility 
to 
prize 
himself 
and 
govern 
himself, 
as 
love 
can 
do: 
so 
certainly, 
if 
a 
man’s 
mind 
be 
truly 
inflamed 
with 
charity, 
it 
doth 
work 
him 
suddenly 
into 
greater 
perfection 
than 
all 
the 
doctrine 
of 
morality 
can 
do, 
which 
is 
but 
a 
sophist 
in 
comparison 
of 
the 
other. 
Nay, 
further, 
as 
Xenophon 
observed 
truly, 
that 
all 
other 
affections, 
though 
they 
raise 
the 
mind, 
yet 
they 
do 
it 
by 
distorting 
and 
uncomeliness 
of 
ecstasies 
or 
excesses; 
but 
only 
love 
doth 
exalt 
the 
mind, 
and 
nevertheless 
at 
the 
same 
instant 
doth 
settle 
and 
compose 
it: 
so 
in 
all 
other 
excellences, 
though 
they 
advance 
nature, 
yet 
they 
are 
subject 
to 
excess. 
Only 
charity 
admitteth 
no 
excess. 
For 
so 
we 
see, 
aspiring 
to 
be 
like 
God 
in 
power, 
the 
angels 
transgressed 
and 
fell; 
Ascendam, 
et 
ero 
similis 
altissimo: 
by 
aspiring 
to 
be 
like 
God 
in 
knowledge, 
man 
transgressed 
and 
fell; 
Eritis 
sicut 
Dii, 
scientes 
bonum 
et 
malum: 
but 
by 
aspiring 
to 
a 
similitude 
of 
God 
in 
goodness 
or 
love, 
neither 
man 
nor 
angel 
ever 
transgressed, 
or 
shall 
transgress. 
For 
unto 
that 
imitation 
we 
are 
called: 
Diligite 
inimicos 
vestros, 
benefacite 
eis 
qui 
oderunt 
vos, 
et 
orate 
pro 
persequentibus 
et 
calumniantibus 
vos, 
ut 
sitis 
filii 
Patris 
vestri 
qui 
in 
coelis 
est, 
qui 
solem 
suum 
oriri 
facit 
super 
bonos 
et 
malos, 
et 
pluit 
super 
justos 
et 
injustos. 
So 
in 
the 
first 
platform 
of 
the 
divine 
nature 
itself, 
the 
heathen 
religion 
speaketh 
thus, 
Optimus 
Maximus: 
and 
the 
sacred 
Scriptures 
thus, 
Miscericordia 
ejus 
super 
omnia 
opera 
ejus. 


(16) 
Wherefore 
I 
do 
conclude 
this 
part 
of 
moral 
knowledge, 
concerning 
the 
culture 
and 
regiment 
of 
the 
mind; 
wherein 
if 
any 
man, 
considering 
the 
arts 
thereof 
which 
I 
have 
enumerated, 
do 
judge 
that 
my 

labour 
is 
but 
to 
collect 
into 
an 
art 
or 
science 
that 
which 
hath 
been 
pretermitted 
by 
others, 
as 
matter 
of 
common 
sense 
and 
experience, 
he 
judgeth 
well. 
But 
as 
Philocrates 
sported 
with 
Demosthenes, 
“You 
may 
not 
marvel 
(Athenians) 
that 
Demosthenes 
and 
I 
do 
differ; 
for 
he 
drinketh 
water, 
and 
I 
drink 
wine;” 
and 
like 
as 
we 
read 
of 
an 
ancient 
parable 
of 
the 
two 
gates 
of 
sleep 
— 


“Sunt 
geminae 
somni 
portae: 
quarum 
altera 
fertur 
Cornea, 
qua 
veris 
facilis 
datur 
exitus 
umbris: 
Altera 
candenti 
perfecta 
nitens 
elephanto, 
Sed 
falsa 
ad 
coelum 
mittunt 
insomnia 
manes:” 


so 
if 
we 
put 
on 
sobriety 
and 
attention, 
we 
shall 
find 
it 
a 
sure 
maxim 
in 
knowledge, 
that 
the 
more 
pleasant 
liquor 
(“of 
wine”) 
is 
the 
more 
vaporous, 
and 
the 
braver 
gate 
(“of 
ivory”) 
sendeth 
forth 
the 
falser 
dreams. 


(17) 
But 
we 
have 
now 
concluded 
that 
general 
part 
of 
human 
philosophy, 
which 
contemplateth 
man 
segregate, 
and 
as 
he 
consisteth 
of 
body 
and 
spirit. 
Wherein 
we 
may 
further 
note, 
that 
there 
seemeth 
to 
be 
a 
relation 
or 
conformity 
between 
the 
good 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
the 
good 
of 
the 
body. 
For 
as 
we 
divided 
the 
good 
of 
the 
body 
into 
health, 
beauty, 
strength, 
and 
pleasure, 
so 
the 
good 
of 
the 
mind, 
inquired 
in 
rational 
and 
moral 
knowledges, 
tendeth 
to 
this, 
to 
make 
the 
mind 
sound, 
and 
without 
perturbation; 
beautiful, 
and 
graced 
with 
decency; 
and 
strong 
and 
agile 
for 
all 
duties 
of 
life. 
These 
three, 
as 
in 
the 
body, 
so 
in 
the 
mind, 
seldom 
meet, 
and 
commonly 
sever. 
For 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
observe, 
that 
many 
have 
strength 
of 
wit 
and 
courage, 
but 
have 
neither 
health 
from 
perturbations, 
nor 
any 
beauty 
or 
decency 
in 
their 
doings; 
some 
again 
have 
an 
elegancy 
and 
fineness 
of 
carriage 
which 
have 
neither 
soundness 
of 
honesty 
nor 
substance 
of 
sufficiency; 
and 
some 
again 
have 
honest 
and 
reformed 
minds, 
that 
can 
neither 
become 
themselves 
nor 
manage 
business; 
and 
sometimes 
two 
of 
them 
meet, 
and 
rarely 
all 
three. 
As 
for 
pleasure, 
we 
have 
likewise 
determined 
that 
the 
mind 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
reduced 
to 
stupid, 
but 
to 
retain 
pleasure; 
confined 
rather 
in 
the 
subject 
of 
it, 
than 
in 
the 
strength 
and 
vigour 
of 
it. 

XXIII 


(1) 
Civil 
knowledge 
is 
conversant 
about 
a 
subject 
which 
of 
all 
others 
is 
most 
immersed 
in 
matter, 
and 
hardliest 
reduced 
to 
axiom. 
Nevertheless, 
as 
Cato 
the 
Censor 
said, 
“That 
the 
Romans 
were 
like 
sheep, 
for 
that 
a 
man 
were 
better 
drive 
a 
flock 
of 
them, 
than 
one 
of 
them; 
for 
in 
a 
flock, 
if 
you 
could 
get 
but 
some 
few 
go 
right, 
the 
rest 
would 
follow:” 
so 
in 
that 
respect 
moral 
philosophy 
is 
more 
difficile 
than 
policy. 
Again, 
moral 
philosophy 
propoundeth 
to 
itself 
the 
framing 
of 
internal 
goodness; 
but 
civil 
knowledge 
requireth 
only 
an 
external 
goodness; 
for 
that 
as 
to 
society 
sufficeth. 
And 
therefore 
it 
cometh 
oft 
to 
pass 
that 
there 
be 
evil 
times 
in 
good 
governments: 
for 
so 
we 
find 
in 
the 
Holy 
story, 
when 
the 
kings 
were 
good, 
yet 
it 
is 
added, 
Sed 
adhuc 
poulus 
non 
direxerat 
cor 
suum 
ad 
Dominum 
Deum 
patrum 
suorum. 
Again, 
states, 
as 
great 
engines, 
move 
slowly, 
and 
are 
not 
so 
soon 
put 
out 
of 
frame: 
for 
as 
in 
Egypt 
the 
seven 
good 
years 
sustained 
the 
seven 
bad, 
so 
governments 
for 
a 
time 
well 
grounded 
do 
bear 
out 
errors 
following; 
but 
the 
resolution 
of 
particular 
persons 
is 
more 
suddenly 
subverted. 
These 
respects 
do 
somewhat 
qualify 
the 
extreme 
difficulty 
of 
civil 
knowledge. 
(2) 
This 
knowledge 
hath 
three 
parts, 
according 
to 
the 
three 
summary 
actions 
of 
society; 
which 
are 
conversation, 
negotiation, 
and 
government. 
For 
man 
seeketh 
in 
society 
comfort, 
use, 
and 
protection; 
and 
they 
be 
three 
wisdoms 
of 
divers 
natures 
which 
do 
often 
sever 
— 
wisdom 
of 
the 
behaviour, 
wisdom 
of 
business, 
and 
wisdom 
of 
state. 
(3) 
The 
wisdom 
of 
conversation 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
over 
much 
affected, 
but 
much 
less 
despised; 
for 
it 
hath 
not 
only 
an 
honour 
in 
itself, 
but 
an 
influence 
also 
into 
business 
and 
government. 
The 
poet 
saith, 
Nec 
vultu 
destrue 
verba 
tuo: 
a 
man 
may 
destroy 
the 
force 
of 
his 
words 
with 
his 
countenance; 
so 
may 
he 
of 
his 
deeds, 
saith 
Cicero, 
recommending 
to 
his 
brother 
affability 
and 
easy 
access; 
Nil 
interest 
habere 
ostium 
apertum, 
vultum 
clausum: 
it 
is 
nothing 
won 
to 
admit 
men 
with 
an 
open 
door, 
and 
to 
receive 
them 
with 
a 
shut 
and 
reserved 
countenance. 
So 
we 
see 
Atticus, 
before 
the 
first 
interview 
between 
Caesar 
and 
Cicero, 
the 
war 
depending, 
did 
seriously 
advise 
Cicero 
touching 
the 
composing 
and 
ordering 
of 
his 
countenance 
and 

gesture. 
And 
if 
the 
government 
of 
the 
countenance 
be 
of 
such 
effect, 
much 
more 
is 
that 
of 
the 
speech, 
and 
other 
carriage 
appertaining 
to 
conversation; 
the 
true 
model 
whereof 
seemeth 
to 
me 
well 
expressed 
by 
Livy, 
though 
not 
meant 
for 
this 
purpose: 
Ne 
aut 
arrogans 
videar, 
aut 
obnoxius; 
quorum 
alterum 
est 
alienae 
libertatis 
obliti, 
alterum 
suae: 
the 
sum 
of 
behaviour 
is 
to 
retain 
a 
man’s 
own 
dignity, 
without 
intruding 
upon 
the 
liberty 
of 
others. 
On 
the 
other 
side, 
if 
behaviour 
and 
outward 
carriage 
be 
intended 
too 
much, 
first 
it 
may 
pass 
into 
affectation, 
and 
then 
Quid 
deformius 
quam 
scenam 
in 
vitam 
transferre 
— 
to 
act 
a 
man’s 
life? 
But 
although 
it 
proceed 
not 
to 
that 
extreme, 
yet 
it 
consumeth 
time, 
and 
employeth 
the 
mind 
too 
much. 
And 
therefore 
as 
we 
use 
to 
advise 
young 
students 
from 
company 
keeping, 
by 
saying, 
Amici 
fures 
temporis: 
so 
certainly 
the 
intending 
of 
the 
discretion 
of 
behaviour 
is 
a 
great 
thief 
of 
meditation. 
Again, 
such 
as 
are 
accomplished 
in 
that 
form 
of 
urbanity 
please 
themselves 
in 
it, 
and 
seldom 
aspire 
to 
higher 
virtue; 
whereas 
those 
that 
have 
defect 
in 
it 
do 
seek 
comeliness 
by 
reputation; 
for 
where 
reputation 
is, 
almost 
everything 
becometh; 
but 
where 
that 
is 
not, 
it 
must 
be 
supplied 
by 
puntos 
and 
compliments. 
Again, 
there 
is 
no 
greater 
impediment 
of 
action 
than 
an 
over-curious 
observance 
of 
decency, 
and 
the 
guide 
of 
decency, 
which 
is 
time 
and 
season. 
For 
as 
Solomon 
saith, 
Qui 
respicit 
ad 
ventos, 
non 
seminat; 
et 
qui 
respicit 
ad 
nubes, 
non 
metet: 
a 
man 
must 
make 
his 
opportunity, 
as 
oft 
as 
find 
it. 
To 
conclude, 
behaviour 
seemeth 
to 
me 
as 
a 
garment 
of 
the 
mind, 
and 
to 
have 
the 
conditions 
of 
a 
garment. 
For 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
made 
in 
fashion; 
it 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
too 
curious; 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
shaped 
so 
as 
to 
set 
forth 
any 
good 
making 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
hide 
any 
deformity; 
and 
above 
all, 
it 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
too 
strait 
or 
restrained 
for 
exercise 
or 
motion. 
But 
this 
part 
of 
civil 
knowledge 
hath 
been 
elegantly 
handled, 
and 
therefore 
I 
cannot 
report 
it 
for 
deficient. 


(4) 
The 
wisdom 
touching 
negotiation 
or 
business 
hath 
not 
been 
hitherto 
collected 
into 
writing, 
to 
the 
great 
derogation 
of 
learning 
and 
the 
professors 
of 
learning. 
For 
from 
this 
root 
springeth 
chiefly 
that 
note 
or 
opinion, 
which 
by 
us 
is 
expressed 
in 
adage 
to 
this 
effect, 
that 
there 
is 
no 
great 
concurrence 
between 
learning 
and 
wisdom. 
For 
of 
the 
three 
wisdoms 
which 
we 
have 
set 
down 
to 
pertain 
to 
civil 
life, 
for 
wisdom 
of 
behaviour, 
it 
is 
by 
learned 
men 
for 
the 
most 
part 
despised, 
as 
an 
inferior 
to 
virtue 
and 
an 
enemy 
to 
meditation; 
for 
wisdom 
of 
government, 
they 
acquit 
themselves 
well 
when 
they 
are 
called 
to 
it, 
but 
that 
happeneth 
to 
few; 
but 
for 
the 
wisdom 
of 
business, 
wherein 
man’s 
life 
is 
most 
conversant, 
there 
be 
no 
books 
of 
it, 

except 
some 
few 
scattered 
advertisements, 
that 
have 
no 
proportion 
to 
the 
magnitude 
of 
this 
subject. 
For 
if 
books 
were 
written 
of 
this 
as 
the 
other, 
I 
doubt 
not 
but 
learned 
men 
with 
mean 
experience 
would 
far 
excel 
men 
of 
long 
experience 
without 
learning, 
and 
outshoot 
them 
in 
their 
own 
bow. 


(5) 
Neither 
needeth 
it 
at 
all 
to 
be 
doubted, 
that 
this 
knowledge 
should 
be 
so 
variable 
as 
it 
falleth 
not 
under 
precept; 
for 
it 
is 
much 
less 
infinite 
than 
science 
of 
government, 
which 
we 
see 
is 
laboured 
and 
in 
some 
part 
reduced. 
Of 
this 
wisdom 
it 
seemeth 
some 
of 
the 
ancient 
Romans 
in 
the 
saddest 
and 
wisest 
times 
were 
professors; 
for 
Cicero 
reporteth, 
that 
it 
was 
then 
in 
use 
for 
senators 
that 
had 
name 
and 
opinion 
for 
general 
wise 
men, 
as 
Coruncanius, 
Curius, 
Laelius, 
and 
many 
others, 
to 
walk 
at 
certain 
hours 
in 
the 
Place, 
and 
to 
give 
audience 
to 
those 
that 
would 
use 
their 
advice; 
and 
that 
the 
particular 
citizens 
would 
resort 
unto 
them, 
and 
consult 
with 
them 
of 
the 
marriage 
of 
a 
daughter, 
or 
of 
the 
employing 
of 
a 
son, 
or 
of 
a 
purchase 
or 
bargain, 
or 
of 
an 
accusation, 
and 
every 
other 
occasion 
incident 
to 
man’s 
life. 
So 
as 
there 
is 
a 
wisdom 
of 
counsel 
and 
advice 
even 
in 
private 
causes, 
arising 
out 
of 
a 
universal 
insight 
into 
the 
affairs 
of 
the 
world; 
which 
is 
used 
indeed 
upon 
particular 
causes 
propounded, 
but 
is 
gathered 
by 
general 
observation 
of 
causes 
of 
like 
nature. 
For 
so 
we 
see 
in 
the 
book 
which 
Q. 
Cicero 
writeth 
to 
his 
brother, 
De 
petitione 
consulatus 
(being 
the 
only 
book 
of 
business 
that 
I 
know 
written 
by 
the 
ancients), 
although 
it 
concerned 
a 
particular 
action 
then 
on 
foot, 
yet 
the 
substance 
thereof 
consisteth 
of 
many 
wise 
and 
politic 
axioms, 
which 
contain 
not 
a 
temporary, 
but 
a 
perpetual 
direction 
in 
the 
case 
of 
popular 
elections. 
But 
chiefly 
we 
may 
see 
in 
those 
aphorisms 
which 
have 
place 
amongst 
divine 
writings, 
composed 
by 
Solomon 
the 
king, 
of 
whom 
the 
Scriptures 
testify 
that 
his 
heart 
was 
as 
the 
sands 
of 
the 
sea, 
encompassing 
the 
world 
and 
all 
worldly 
matters, 
we 
see, 
I 
say, 
not 
a 
few 
profound 
and 
excellent 
cautions, 
precepts, 
positions, 
extending 
to 
much 
variety 
of 
occasions; 
whereupon 
we 
will 
stay 
a 
while, 
offering 
to 
consideration 
some 
number 
of 
examples. 
(6) 
Sed 
et 
cunctis 
sermonibus 
qui 
dicuntur 
ne 
accommodes 
aurem 
tuam, 
ne 
forte 
audias 
servum 
tuum 
maledicentem 
tibi. 
Here 
is 
commended 
the 
provident 
stay 
of 
inquiry 
of 
that 
which 
we 
would 
be 
loth 
to 
find: 
as 
it 
was 
judged 
great 
wisdom 
in 
Pompeius 
Magnus 
that 
he 
burned 
Sertorius’ 
papers 
unperused. 
Vir 
sapiens, 
si 
cum 
stulto 
contenderit, 
sive 
irascatur, 
sive 
rideat, 
non 



inveniet 
requiem. 
Here 
is 
described 
the 
great 
disadvantage 
which 
a 
wise 
man 
hath 
in 
undertaking 
a 
lighter 
person 
than 
himself; 
which 
is 
such 
an 
engagement 
as, 
whether 
a 
man 
turn 
the 
matter 
to 
jest, 
or 
turn 
it 
to 
heat, 
or 
howsoever 
he 
change 
copy, 
he 
can 
no 
ways 
quit 
himself 
well 
of 
it. 


Qui 
delicate 
a 
pueritia 
nutrit 
servum 
suum, 
postea 
sentiet 
eum 
contumacem. 
Here 
is 
signified, 
that 
if 
a 
man 
begin 
too 
high 
a 
pitch 
in 
his 
favours, 
it 
doth 
commonly 
end 
in 
unkindness 
and 
unthankfulness. 


Vidisti 
virum 
velocem 
in 
opere 
suo? 
coram 
regibus 
stabit, 
nec 
erit 
inter 
ignobiles. 
Here 
is 
observed, 
that 
of 
all 
virtues 
for 
rising 
to 
honour, 
quickness 
of 
despatch 
is 
the 
best; 
for 
superiors 
many 
times 
love 
not 
to 
have 
those 
they 
employ 
too 
deep 
or 
too 
sufficient, 
but 
ready 
and 
diligent. 


Vidi 
cunctos 
viventes 
qui 
ambulant 
sub 
sole, 
cum 
adolescente 
secundo 
qui 
consurgit 
pro 
eo. 
Here 
is 
expressed 
that 
which 
was 
noted 
by 
Sylla 
first, 
and 
after 
him 
by 
Tiberius. 
Plures 
adorant 
solem 
orientem 
quam 
occidentem 
vel 
meridianum. 


Si 
spiritus 
potestatem 
habentis 
ascenderit 
super 
te, 
locum 
tuum 
ne 
demiseris; 
quia 
curatio 
faciet 
cessare 
peccata 
maxima. 
Here 
caution 
is 
given, 
that 
upon 
displeasure, 
retiring 
is 
of 
all 
courses 
the 
unfittest; 
for 
a 
man 
leaveth 
things 
at 
worst, 
and 
depriveth 
himself 
of 
means 
to 
make 
them 
better. 


Erat 
civitas 
parva, 
et 
pauci 
in 
ea 
viri: 
venit 
contra 
eam 
rex 
magnus, 
et 
vallavit 
eam, 
instruxitque 
munitones 
per 
gyrum, 
et 
perfecta 
est 
obsidio; 
inventusque 
est 
in 
ea 
vir 
pauper 
et 
sapiens, 
et 
liberavit 
eam 
per 
sapientiam 
suam; 
et 
nullus 
deinceps 
recordatus 
est 
huminis 
illius 
pauperis. 
Here 
the 
corruption 
of 
states 
is 
set 
forth, 
that 
esteem 
not 
virtue 
or 
merit 
longer 
than 
they 
have 
use 
of 
it. 


Millis 
responsio 
frangit 
iram. 
Here 
is 
noted 
that 
silence 
or 
rough 
answer 
exasperateth; 
but 
an 
answer 
present 
and 
temperate 
pacifieth. 


Iter 
pigrorum 
quasi 
sepes 
spinarum. 
Here 
is 
lively 
represented 
how 
laborious 
sloth 
proveth 
in 
the 
end; 
for 
when 
things 
are 
deferred 
till 
the 
last 
instant, 
and 
nothing 
prepared 
beforehand, 
every 
step 
findeth 
a 
briar 
or 
impediment, 
which 
catcheth 
or 
stoppeth. 


Melior 
est 
finis 
orationis 
quam 
principium. 
Here 
is 
taxed 
the 
vanity 
of 
formal 
speakers, 
that 
study 
more 
about 
prefaces 
and 
inducements, 
than 
upon 
the 
conclusions 
and 
issues 
of 
speech. 



Qui 
cognoscit 
in 
judicio 
faciem, 
non 
bene 
facit; 
iste 
et 
pro 
buccella 
panis 
deseret 
veritatem. 
Here 
is 
noted, 
that 
a 
judge 
were 
better 
be 
a 
briber 
than 
a 
respecter 
of 
persons; 
for 
a 
corrupt 
judge 
offendeth 
not 
so 
lightly 
as 
a 
facile. 


Vir 
pauper 
calumnians 
pauperes 
simils 
est 
imbri 
vehementi, 
in 
quo 
paratur 
fames. 
Here 
is 
expressed 
the 
extremity 
of 
necessitous 
extortions, 
figured 
in 
the 
ancient 
fable 
of 
the 
full 
and 
the 
hungry 
horseleech. 


Fons 
turbatus 
pede, 
et 
vena 
corrupta, 
est 
justus 
cadens 
coram 
impio. 
Here 
is 
noted, 
that 
one 
judicial 
and 
exemplar 
iniquity 
in 
the 
face 
of 
the 
world 
doth 
trouble 
the 
fountains 
of 
justice 
more 
than 
many 
particular 
injuries 
passed 
over 
by 
connivance. 


Qui 
subtrahit 
aliquid 
a 
patre 
et 
a 
matre, 
et 
dicit 
hoc 
non 
esse 
peccatum, 
particeps 
est 
homicidii. 
Here 
is 
noted 
that, 
whereas 
men 
in 
wronging 
their 
best 
friends 
use 
to 
extenuate 
their 
fault, 
as 
if 
they 
might 
presume 
or 
be 
bold 
upon 
them, 
it 
doth 
contrariwise 
indeed 
aggravate 
their 
fault, 
and 
turneth 
it 
from 
injury 
to 
impiety. 


Noli 
esse 
amicus 
homini 
iracundo, 
nec 
ambulato 
cum 
homine 
furioso. 
Here 
caution 
is 
given, 
that 
in 
the 
election 
of 
our 
friends 
we 
do 
principally 
avoid 
those 
which 
are 
impatient, 
as 
those 
that 
will 
espouse 
us 
to 
many 
factions 
and 
quarrels. 


Qui 
conturbat 
domum 
suam, 
possidebit 
ventum. 
Here 
is 
noted, 
that 
in 
domestical 
separations 
and 
breaches 
men 
do 
promise 
to 
themselves 
quieting 
of 
their 
mind 
and 
contentment; 
but 
still 
they 
are 
deceived 
of 
their 
expectation, 
and 
it 
turneth 
to 
wind. 


Filius 
sapiens 
laetificat 
patrem: 
filius 
vero 
stultus 
maestitia 
est 
matri 
suae. 
Here 
is 
distinguished, 
that 
fathers 
have 
most 
comfort 
of 
the 
good 
proof 
of 
their 
sons; 
but 
mothers 
have 
most 
discomfort 
of 
their 
ill 
proof, 
because 
women 
have 
little 
discerning 
of 
virtue, 
but 
of 
fortune. 


Qui 
celat 
delictum, 
quaerit 
amicitiam; 
sed 
qui 
altero 
sermone 
repetit, 
separat 
faederatos. 
Here 
caution 
is 
given, 
that 
reconcilement 
is 
better 
managed 
by 
an 
amnesty, 
and 
passing 
over 
that 
which 
is 
past, 
than 
by 
apologies 
and 
excuses. 


In 
omni 
opere 
bono 
erit 
abundantia; 
ubi 
autem 
verba 
sunt 
plurima, 
ibi 
frequenter 
egestas. 
Here 
is 
noted, 
that 
words 
and 
discourse 
aboundeth 



most 
where 
there 
is 
idleness 
and 
want. 


Primus 
in 
sua 
causa 
justus: 
sed 
venit 
altera 
pars, 
et 
inquiret 
in 
eum. 
Here 
is 
observed, 
that 
in 
all 
causes 
the 
first 
tale 
possesseth 
much; 
in 
sort, 
that 
the 
prejudice 
thereby 
wrought 
will 
be 
hardly 
removed, 
except 
some 
abuse 
or 
falsity 
in 
the 
information 
be 
detected. 


Verba 
bilinguis 
quasi 
simplicia, 
et 
ipsa 
perveniunt 
ad 
interiora 
ventris. 
Here 
is 
distinguished, 
that 
flattery 
and 
insinuation, 
which 
seemeth 
set 
and 
artificial, 
sinketh 
not 
far; 
but 
that 
entereth 
deep 
which 
hath 
show 
of 
nature, 
liberty, 
and 
simplicity. 


Qui 
erudit 
derisorem, 
ipse 
sibi 
injuriam 
facit; 
et 
qui 
arguit 
impium, 
sibi 
maculam 
generat. 
Here 
caution 
is 
given 
how 
we 
tender 
reprehension 
to 
arrogant 
and 
scornful 
natures, 
whose 
manner 
is 
to 
esteem 
it 
for 
contumely, 
and 
accordingly 
to 
return 
it. 


Da 
sapienti 
occasionem, 
et 
addetur 
ei 
sapientia. 
Here 
is 
distinguished 
the 
wisdom 
brought 
into 
habit, 
and 
that 
which 
is 
but 
verbal 
and 
swimming 
only 
in 
conceit; 
for 
the 
one 
upon 
the 
occasion 
presented 
is 
quickened 
and 
redoubled, 
the 
other 
is 
amazed 
and 
confused. 


Quomodo 
in 
aquis 
resplendent 
vultus 
prospicientium, 
sic 
corda 
hominum 
manifesta 
sunt 
prudentibus. 
Here 
the 
mind 
of 
a 
wise 
man 
is 
compared 
to 
a 
glass, 
wherein 
the 
images 
of 
all 
diversity 
of 
natures 
and 
customs 
are 
represented; 
from 
which 
representation 
proceedeth 
that 
application, 


“Qui 
sapit, 
innumeris 
moribus 
aptus 
erit.” 


(7) 
Thus 
have 
I 
stayed 
somewhat 
longer 
upon 
these 
sentences 
politic 
of 
Solomon 
than 
is 
agreeable 
to 
the 
proportion 
of 
an 
example; 
led 
with 
a 
desire 
to 
give 
authority 
to 
this 
part 
of 
knowledge, 
which 
I 
noted 
as 
deficient, 
by 
so 
excellent 
a 
precedent; 
and 
have 
also 
attended 
them 
with 
brief 
observations, 
such 
as 
to 
my 
understanding 
offer 
no 
violence 
to 
the 
sense, 
though 
I 
know 
they 
may 
be 
applied 
to 
a 
more 
divine 
use: 
but 
it 
is 
allowed, 
even 
in 
divinity, 
that 
some 
interpretations, 
yea, 
and 
some 
writings, 
have 
more 
of 
the 
eagle 
than 
others; 
but 
taking 
them 
as 
instructions 
for 
life, 
they 
might 
have 
received 
large 
discourse, 
if 
I 
would 
have 
broken 
them 
and 
illustrated 
them 
by 
deducements 
and 
examples. 
(8) 
Neither 
was 
this 
in 
use 
only 
with 
the 
Hebrews, 
but 
it 
is 
generally 

to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
wisdom 
of 
the 
more 
ancient 
times; 
that 
as 
men 
found 
out 
any 
observation 
that 
they 
thought 
was 
good 
for 
life, 
they 
would 
gather 
it 
and 
express 
it 
in 
parable 
or 
aphorism 
or 
fable. 
But 
for 
fables, 
they 
were 
vicegerents 
and 
supplies 
where 
examples 
failed: 
now 
that 
the 
times 
abound 
with 
history, 
the 
aim 
is 
better 
when 
the 
mark 
is 
alive. 
And 
therefore 
the 
form 
of 
writing 
which 
of 
all 
others 
is 
fittest 
for 
this 
variable 
argument 
of 
negotiation 
and 
occasions 
is 
that 
which 
Machiavel 
chose 
wisely 
and 
aptly 
for 
government; 
namely, 
discourse 
upon 
histories 
or 
examples. 
For 
knowledge 
drawn 
freshly 
and 
in 
our 
view 
out 
of 
particulars, 
knoweth 
the 
way 
best 
to 
particulars 
again. 
And 
it 
hath 
much 
greater 
life 
for 
practice 
when 
the 
discourse 
attendeth 
upon 
the 
example, 
than 
when 
the 
example 
attendeth 
upon 
the 
discourse. 
For 
this 
is 
no 
point 
of 
order, 
as 
it 
seemeth 
at 
first, 
but 
of 
substance. 
For 
when 
the 
example 
is 
the 
ground, 
being 
set 
down 
in 
a 
history 
at 
large, 
it 
is 
set 
down 
with 
all 
circumstances, 
which 
may 
sometimes 
control 
the 
discourse 
thereupon 
made, 
and 
sometimes 
supply 
it, 
as 
a 
very 
pattern 
for 
action; 
whereas 
the 
examples 
alleged 
for 
the 
discourse’s 
sake 
are 
cited 
succinctly, 
and 
without 
particularity, 
and 
carry 
a 
servile 
aspect 
towards 
the 
discourse 
which 
they 
are 
brought 
in 
to 
make 
good. 


(9) 
But 
this 
difference 
is 
not 
amiss 
to 
be 
remembered, 
that 
as 
history 
of 
times 
is 
the 
best 
ground 
for 
discourse 
of 
government, 
such 
as 
Machiavel 
handleth, 
so 
histories 
of 
lives 
is 
the 
most 
popular 
for 
discourse 
of 
business, 
because 
it 
is 
more 
conversant 
in 
private 
actions. 
Nay, 
there 
is 
a 
ground 
of 
discourse 
for 
this 
purpose 
fitter 
than 
them 
both, 
which 
is 
discourse 
upon 
letters, 
such 
as 
are 
wise 
and 
weighty, 
as 
many 
are 
of 
Cicero 
ad 
Atticum, 
and 
others. 
For 
letters 
have 
a 
great 
and 
more 
particular 
representation 
of 
business 
than 
either 
chronicles 
or 
lives. 
Thus 
have 
we 
spoken 
both 
of 
the 
matter 
and 
form 
of 
this 
part 
of 
civil 
knowledge, 
touching 
negotiation, 
which 
we 
note 
to 
be 
deficient. 
(10) 
But 
yet 
there 
is 
another 
part 
of 
this 
part, 
which 
differeth 
as 
much 
from 
that 
whereof 
we 
have 
spoken 
as 
sapere 
and 
sibi 
sapere, 
the 
one 
moving 
as 
it 
were 
to 
the 
circumference, 
the 
other 
to 
the 
centre. 
For 
there 
is 
a 
wisdom 
of 
counsel, 
and 
again 
there 
is 
a 
wisdom 
of 
pressing 
a 
man’s 
own 
fortune; 
and 
they 
do 
sometimes 
meet, 
and 
often 
sever. 
For 
many 
are 
wise 
in 
their 
own 
ways 
that 
are 
weak 
for 
government 
or 
counsel; 
like 
ants, 
which 
is 
a 
wise 
creature 
for 
itself, 
but 
very 
hurtful 
for 
the 
garden. 
This 
wisdom 
the 
Romans 
did 
take 
much 
knowledge 
of: 
Nam 
pol 
sapiens 
(saith 
the 
comical 

poet) 
fingit 
fortunam 
sibi; 
and 
it 
grew 
to 
an 
adage, 
Faber 
quisque 
fortunae 
propriae; 
and 
Livy 
attributed 
it 
to 
Cato 
the 
first, 
In 
hoc 
viro 
tanta 
vis 
animi 
et 
ingenii 
inerat, 
ut 
quocunque 
loco 
natus 
esset 
sibi 
ipse 
fortunam 
facturus 
videretur. 


(11) 
This 
conceit 
or 
position, 
if 
it 
be 
too 
much 
declared 
and 
professed, 
hath 
been 
thought 
a 
thing 
impolitic 
and 
unlucky, 
as 
was 
observed 
in 
Timotheus 
the 
Athenian, 
who, 
having 
done 
many 
great 
services 
to 
the 
state 
in 
his 
government, 
and 
giving 
an 
account 
thereof 
to 
the 
people 
as 
the 
manner 
was, 
did 
conclude 
every 
particular 
with 
this 
clause, 
“And 
in 
this 
fortune 
had 
no 
part.” 
And 
it 
came 
so 
to 
pass, 
that 
he 
never 
prospered 
in 
anything 
he 
took 
in 
hand 
afterwards. 
For 
this 
is 
too 
high 
and 
too 
arrogant, 
savouring 
of 
that 
which 
Ezekiel 
saith 
of 
Pharaoh, 
Dicis, 
Fluvius 
est 
neus 
et 
ego 
feci 
memet 
ipsum; 
or 
of 
that 
which 
another 
prophet 
speaketh, 
that 
men 
offer 
sacrifices 
to 
their 
nets 
and 
snares; 
and 
that 
which 
the 
poet 
expresseth, 
“Dextra 
mihi 
Deus, 
et 
telum 
quod 
missile 
libro, 
Nunc 
adsint!” 


For 
these 
confidences 
were 
ever 
unhallowed, 
and 
unblessed; 
and, 
therefore, 
those 
that 
were 
great 
politiques 
indeed 
ever 
ascribed 
their 
successes 
to 
their 
felicity 
and 
not 
to 
their 
skill 
or 
virtue. 
For 
so 
Sylla 
surnamed 
himself 
Felix, 
not 
Magnus. 
So 
Caesar 
said 
to 
the 
master 
of 
the 
ship, 
Caesarem 
portas 
et 
fortunam 
ejus. 


(12) 
But 
yet, 
nevertheless, 
these 
positions, 
Faber 
quisque 
fortunae 
suae: 
Sapiens 
dominabitur 
astris: 
Invia 
virtuti 
null 
est 
via, 
and 
the 
like, 
being 
taken 
and 
used 
as 
spurs 
to 
industry, 
and 
not 
as 
stirrups 
to 
insolency, 
rather 
for 
resolution 
than 
for 
the 
presumption 
or 
outward 
declaration, 
have 
been 
ever 
thought 
sound 
and 
good; 
and 
are 
no 
question 
imprinted 
in 
the 
greatest 
minds, 
who 
are 
so 
sensible 
of 
this 
opinion 
as 
they 
can 
scarce 
contain 
it 
within. 
As 
we 
see 
in 
Augustus 
Caesar 
(who 
was 
rather 
diverse 
from 
his 
uncle 
than 
inferior 
in 
virtue), 
how 
when 
he 
died 
he 
desired 
his 
friends 
about 
him 
to 
give 
him 
a 
plaudite, 
as 
if 
he 
were 
conscious 
to 
himself 
that 
he 
had 
played 
his 
part 
well 
upon 
the 
stage. 
This 
part 
of 
knowledge 
we 
do 
report 
also 
as 
deficient; 
not 
but 
that 
it 
is 
practised 
too 
much, 
but 
it 
hath 
not 
been 
reduced 
to 
writing. 
And, 
therefore, 
lest 
it 
should 
seem 
to 
any 
that 
it 
is 
not 
comprehensible 
by 
axiom, 
it 
is 
requisite, 
as 
we 
did 
in 
the 
former, 
that 
we 
set 
down 
some 
heads 
or 
passages 
of 
it. 
(13) 
Wherein 
it 
may 
appear 
at 
the 
first 
a 
new 
and 
unwonted 

argument 
to 
teach 
men 
how 
to 
raise 
and 
make 
their 
fortune; 
a 
doctrine 
wherein 
every 
man 
perchance 
will 
be 
ready 
to 
yield 
himself 
a 
disciple, 
till 
he 
see 
the 
difficulty: 
for 
fortune 
layeth 
as 
heavy 
impositions 
as 
virtue; 
and 
it 
is 
as 
hard 
and 
severe 
a 
thing 
to 
be 
a 
true 
politique, 
as 
to 
be 
truly 
moral. 
But 
the 
handling 
hereof 
concerneth 
learning 
greatly, 
both 
in 
honour 
and 
in 
substance. 
In 
honour, 
because 
pragmatical 
men 
may 
not 
go 
away 
with 
an 
opinion 
that 
learning 
is 
like 
a 
lark, 
that 
can 
mount 
and 
sing, 
and 
please 
herself, 
and 
nothing 
else; 
but 
may 
know 
that 
she 
holdeth 
as 
well 
of 
the 
hawk, 
that 
can 
soar 
aloft, 
and 
can 
also 
descend 
and 
strike 
upon 
the 
prey. 
In 
substance, 
because 
it 
is 
the 
perfect 
law 
of 
inquiry 
of 
truth, 
that 
nothing 
be 
in 
the 
globe 
of 
matter, 
which 
should 
not 
be 
likewise 
in 
the 
globe 
of 
crystal 
or 
form; 
that 
is, 
that 
there 
be 
not 
anything 
in 
being 
and 
action 
which 
should 
not 
be 
drawn 
and 
collected 
into 
contemplation 
and 
doctrine. 
Neither 
doth 
learning 
admire 
or 
esteem 
of 
this 
architecture 
of 
fortune 
otherwise 
than 
as 
of 
an 
inferior 
work, 
for 
no 
man’s 
fortune 
can 
be 
an 
end 
worthy 
of 
his 
being, 
and 
many 
times 
the 
worthiest 
men 
do 
abandon 
their 
fortune 
willingly 
for 
better 
respects: 
but 
nevertheless 
fortune 
as 
an 
organ 
of 
virtue 
and 
merit 
deserveth 
the 
consideration. 


(14) 
First, 
therefore, 
the 
precept 
which 
I 
conceive 
to 
be 
most 
summary 
towards 
the 
prevailing 
in 
fortune, 
is 
to 
obtain 
that 
window 
which 
Momus 
did 
require; 
who 
seeing 
in 
the 
frame 
of 
man’s 
heart 
such 
angles 
and 
recesses, 
found 
fault 
there 
was 
not 
a 
window 
to 
look 
into 
them; 
that 
is, 
to 
procure 
good 
informations 
of 
particulars 
touching 
persons, 
their 
natures, 
their 
desires 
and 
ends, 
their 
customs 
and 
fashions, 
their 
helps 
and 
advantages, 
and 
whereby 
they 
chiefly 
stand, 
so 
again 
their 
weaknesses 
and 
disadvantages, 
and 
where 
they 
lie 
most 
open 
and 
obnoxious, 
their 
friends, 
factions, 
dependences; 
and 
again 
their 
opposites, 
enviers, 
competitors, 
their 
moods 
and 
times, 
Sola 
viri 
molles 
aditus 
et 
tempora 
noras; 
their 
principles, 
rules, 
and 
observations, 
and 
the 
like: 
and 
this 
not 
only 
of 
persons 
but 
of 
actions; 
what 
are 
on 
foot 
from 
time 
to 
time, 
and 
how 
they 
are 
conducted, 
favoured, 
opposed, 
and 
how 
they 
import, 
and 
the 
like. 
For 
the 
knowledge 
of 
present 
actions 
is 
not 
only 
material 
in 
itself, 
but 
without 
it 
also 
the 
knowledge 
of 
persons 
is 
very 
erroneous: 
for 
men 
change 
with 
the 
actions; 
and 
whilst 
they 
are 
in 
pursuit 
they 
are 
one, 
and 
when 
they 
return 
to 
their 
nature 
they 
are 
another. 
These 
informations 
of 
particulars, 
touching 
persons 
and 
actions, 
are 
as 
the 
minor 
propositions 
in 
every 
active 
syllogism; 
for 
no 
excellency 
of 
observations 
(which 
are 
as 
the 
major 
propositions) 
can 
suffice 
to 
ground 
a 
conclusion, 
if 

there 
be 
error 
and 
mistaking 
in 
the 
minors. 


(15) 
That 
this 
knowledge 
is 
possible, 
Solomon 
is 
our 
surety, 
who 
saith, 
Consilium 
in 
corde 
viri 
tanquam 
aqua 
profunda; 
sed 
vir 
prudens 
exhauriet 
illud. 
And 
although 
the 
knowledge 
itself 
falleth 
not 
under 
precept 
because 
it 
is 
of 
individuals, 
yet 
the 
instructions 
for 
the 
obtaining 
of 
it 
may. 
(16) 
We 
will 
begin, 
therefore, 
with 
this 
precept, 
according 
to 
the 
ancient 
opinion, 
that 
the 
sinews 
of 
wisdom 
are 
slowness 
of 
belief 
and 
distrust; 
that 
more 
trust 
be 
given 
to 
countenances 
and 
deeds 
than 
to 
words; 
and 
in 
words 
rather 
to 
sudden 
passages 
and 
surprised 
words 
than 
to 
set 
and 
purposed 
words. 
Neither 
let 
that 
be 
feared 
which 
is 
said, 
Fronti 
nulla 
fides, 
which 
is 
meant 
of 
a 
general 
outward 
behaviour, 
and 
not 
of 
the 
private 
and 
subtle 
motions 
and 
labours 
of 
the 
countenance 
and 
gesture; 
which, 
as 
Q. 
Cicero 
elegantly 
saith, 
is 
Animi 
janua, 
“the 
gate 
of 
the 
mind.” 
None 
more 
close 
than 
Tiberius, 
and 
yet 
Tacitus 
saith 
of 
Gallus, 
Etenim 
vultu 
offensionem 
conjectaverat. 
So 
again, 
noting 
the 
differing 
character 
and 
manner 
of 
his 
commending 
Germanicus 
and 
Drusus 
in 
the 
Senate, 
he 
saith, 
touching 
his 
fashion 
wherein 
he 
carried 
his 
speech 
of 
Germanicus, 
thus: 
Magis 
in 
speciem 
adornatis 
verbis, 
quam 
ut 
penitus 
sentire 
crederetur; 
but 
of 
Drusus 
thus: 
Paucioribus 
sed 
intentior, 
et 
fida 
oratione; 
and 
in 
another 
place, 
speaking 
of 
his 
character 
of 
speech 
when 
he 
did 
anything 
that 
was 
gracious 
and 
popular, 
he 
saith, 
“That 
in 
other 
things 
he 
was 
velut 
eluctantium 
verborum;” 
but 
then 
again, 
solutius 
loquebatur 
quando 
subveniret. 
So 
that 
there 
is 
no 
such 
artificer 
of 
dissimulation, 
nor 
no 
such 
commanded 
countenance 
(vultus 
jussus), 
that 
can 
sever 
from 
a 
feigned 
tale 
some 
of 
these 
fashions, 
either 
a 
more 
slight 
and 
careless 
fashion, 
or 
more 
set 
and 
formal, 
or 
more 
tedious 
and 
wandering, 
or 
coming 
from 
a 
man 
more 
drily 
and 
hardly. 
(17) 
Neither 
are 
deeds 
such 
assured 
pledges 
as 
that 
they 
may 
be 
trusted 
without 
a 
judicious 
consideration 
of 
their 
magnitude 
and 
nature: 
Fraus 
sibi 
in 
parvis 
fidem 
praestruit 
ut 
majore 
emolumento 
fallat; 
and 
the 
Italian 
thinketh 
himself 
upon 
the 
point 
to 
be 
bought 
and 
sold, 
when 
he 
is 
better 
used 
than 
he 
was 
wont 
to 
be 
without 
manifest 
cause. 
For 
small 
favours, 
they 
do 
but 
lull 
men 
to 
sleep, 
both 
as 
to 
caution 
and 
as 
to 
industry; 
and 
are, 
as 
Demosthenes 
calleth 
them, 
Alimenta 
socordiae. 
So 
again 
we 
see 
how 
false 
the 
nature 
of 
some 
deeds 
are, 
in 
that 
particular 
which 
Mutianus 
practised 
upon 
Antonius 
Primus, 
upon 
that 
hollow 
and 
unfaithful 
reconcilement 
which 
was 
made 
between 
them; 
whereupon 
Mutianus 
advanced 
many 
of 
the 
friends 

of 
Antonius, 
Simul 
amicis 
ejus 
praefecturas 
et 
tribunatus 
largitur: 
wherein, 
under 
pretence 
to 
strengthen 
him, 
he 
did 
desolate 
him, 
and 
won 
from 
him 
his 
dependents. 


(18) 
As 
for 
words, 
though 
they 
be 
like 
waters 
to 
physicians, 
full 
of 
flattery 
and 
uncertainty, 
yet 
they 
are 
not 
to 
be 
despised 
specially 
with 
the 
advantage 
of 
passion 
and 
affection. 
For 
so 
we 
see 
Tiberius, 
upon 
a 
stinging 
and 
incensing 
speech 
of 
Agrippina, 
came 
a 
step 
forth 
of 
his 
dissimulation 
when 
he 
said, 
“You 
are 
hurt 
because 
you 
do 
not 
reign;” 
of 
which 
Tacitus 
saith, 
Audita 
haec 
raram 
occulti 
pectoris 
vocem 
elicuere: 
correptamque 
Graeco 
versu 
admonuit, 
ideo 
laedi 
quia 
non 
regnaret. 
And, 
therefore, 
the 
poet 
doth 
elegantly 
call 
passions 
tortures 
that 
urge 
men 
to 
confess 
their 
secrets:— 
“Vino 
torus 
et 
ira.” 


And 
experience 
showeth 
there 
are 
few 
men 
so 
true 
to 
themselves 
and 
so 
settled 
but 
that, 
sometimes 
upon 
heat, 
sometimes 
upon 
bravery, 
sometimes 
upon 
kindness, 
sometimes 
upon 
trouble 
of 
mind 
and 
weakness, 
they 
open 
themselves; 
specially 
if 
they 
be 
put 
to 
it 
with 
a 
counter-dissimulation, 
according 
to 
the 
proverb 
of 
Spain, 
Di 
mentira, 
y 
sacar 
as 
verdad: 
“Tell 
a 
lie 
and 
find 
a 
truth.” 


(19) 
As 
for 
the 
knowing 
of 
men 
which 
is 
at 
second 
hand 
from 
reports: 
men’s 
weaknesses 
and 
faults 
are 
best 
known 
from 
their 
enemies, 
their 
virtues 
and 
abilities 
from 
their 
friends, 
their 
customs 
and 
times 
from 
their 
servants, 
their 
conceits 
and 
opinions 
from 
their 
familiar 
friends, 
with 
whom 
they 
discourse 
most. 
General 
fame 
is 
light, 
and 
the 
opinions 
conceived 
by 
superiors 
or 
equals 
are 
deceitful; 
for 
to 
such 
men 
are 
more 
masked: 
Verior 
fama 
e 
domesticis 
emanat. 
(20) 
But 
the 
soundest 
disclosing 
and 
expounding 
of 
men 
is 
by 
their 
natures 
and 
ends, 
wherein 
the 
weakest 
sort 
of 
men 
are 
best 
interpreted 
by 
their 
natures, 
and 
the 
wisest 
by 
their 
ends. 
For 
it 
was 
both 
pleasantly 
and 
wisely 
said 
(though 
I 
think 
very 
untruly) 
by 
a 
nuncio 
of 
the 
Pope, 
returning 
from 
a 
certain 
nation 
where 
he 
served 
as 
lidger; 
whose 
opinion 
being 
asked 
touching 
the 
appointment 
of 
one 
to 
go 
in 
his 
place, 
he 
wished 
that 
in 
any 
case 
they 
did 
not 
send 
one 
that 
was 
too 
wise; 
because 
no 
very 
wise 
man 
would 
ever 
imagine 
what 
they 
in 
that 
country 
were 
like 
to 
do. 
And 
certainly 
it 
is 
an 
error 
frequent 
for 
men 
to 
shoot 
over, 
and 
to 
suppose 
deeper 
ends 
and 
more 
compass 
reaches 
than 
are: 
the 
Italian 
proverb 
being 
elegant, 
and 
for 
the 
most 

part 
true:— 


“Di 
danari, 
di 
senno, 
e 
di 
fede, 
C’e 
ne 
manco 
che 
non 
credi.” 


“There 
is 
commonly 
less 
money, 
less 
wisdom, 
and 
less 
good 
faith 
than 
men 
do 
account 
upon.” 


(21) 
But 
princes, 
upon 
a 
far 
other 
reason, 
are 
best 
interpreted 
by 
their 
natures, 
and 
private 
persons 
by 
their 
ends. 
For 
princes 
being 
at 
the 
top 
of 
human 
desires, 
they 
have 
for 
the 
most 
part 
no 
particular 
ends 
whereto 
they 
aspire, 
by 
distance 
from 
which 
a 
man 
might 
take 
measure 
and 
scale 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
their 
actions 
and 
desires; 
which 
is 
one 
of 
the 
causes 
that 
maketh 
their 
hearts 
more 
inscrutable. 
Neither 
is 
it 
sufficient 
to 
inform 
ourselves 
in 
men’s 
ends 
and 
natures 
of 
the 
variety 
of 
them 
only, 
but 
also 
of 
the 
predominancy, 
what 
humour 
reigneth 
most, 
and 
what 
end 
is 
principally 
sought. 
For 
so 
we 
see, 
when 
Tigellinus 
saw 
himself 
outstripped 
by 
Petronius 
Turpilianus 
in 
Nero’s 
humours 
of 
pleasures, 
metus 
ejus 
rimatur, 
he 
wrought 
upon 
Nero’s 
fears, 
whereby 
he 
broke 
the 
other’s 
neck. 
(22) 
But 
to 
all 
this 
part 
of 
inquiry 
the 
most 
compendious 
way 
resteth 
in 
three 
things; 
the 
first, 
to 
have 
general 
acquaintance 
and 
inwardness 
with 
those 
which 
have 
general 
acquaintance 
and 
look 
most 
into 
the 
world; 
and 
specially 
according 
to 
the 
diversity 
of 
business, 
and 
the 
diversity 
of 
persons, 
to 
have 
privacy 
and 
conversation 
with 
some 
one 
friend 
at 
least 
which 
is 
perfect 
and 
well-intelligenced 
in 
every 
several 
kind. 
The 
second 
is 
to 
keep 
a 
good 
mediocrity 
in 
liberty 
of 
speech 
and 
secrecy; 
in 
most 
things 
liberty; 
secrecy 
where 
it 
importeth; 
for 
liberty 
of 
speech 
inviteth 
and 
provoketh 
liberty 
to 
be 
used 
again, 
and 
so 
bringeth 
much 
to 
a 
man’s 
knowledge; 
and 
secrecy 
on 
the 
other 
side 
induceth 
trust 
and 
inwardness. 
The 
last 
is 
the 
reducing 
of 
a 
man’s 
self 
to 
this 
watchful 
and 
serene 
habit, 
as 
to 
make 
account 
and 
purpose, 
in 
every 
conference 
and 
action, 
as 
well 
to 
observe 
as 
to 
act. 
For 
as 
Epictetus 
would 
have 
a 
philosopher 
in 
every 
particular 
action 
to 
say 
to 
himself, 
Et 
hoc 
volo, 
et 
etiam 
institutum 
servare; 
so 
a 
politic 
man 
in 
everything 
should 
say 
to 
himself, 
Et 
hoc 
volo, 
ac 
etiam 
aliquid 
addiscere. 
I 
have 
stayed 
the 
longer 
upon 
this 
precept 
of 
obtaining 
good 
information 
because 
it 
is 
a 
main 
part 
by 
itself, 
which 
answereth 
to 
all 
the 
rest. 
But, 
above 
all 
things, 
caution 
must 
be 
taken 
that 
men 
have 
a 
good 
stay 
and 
hold 
of 
themselves, 
and 
that 
this 
much 
knowing 
do 
not 
draw 
on 
much 
meddling; 
for 
nothing 
is 
more 
unfortunate 
than 
light 
and 
rash 
intermeddling 
in 
many 

matters. 
So 
that 
this 
variety 
of 
knowledge 
tendeth 
in 
conclusion 
but 
only 
to 
this, 
to 
make 
a 
better 
and 
freer 
choice 
of 
those 
actions 
which 
may 
concern 
us, 
and 
to 
conduct 
them 
with 
the 
less 
error 
and 
the 
more 
dexterity. 


(23) 
The 
second 
precept 
concerning 
this 
knowledge 
is, 
for 
men 
to 
take 
good 
information 
touching 
their 
own 
person, 
and 
well 
to 
understand 
themselves; 
knowing 
that, 
as 
St. 
James 
saith, 
though 
men 
look 
oft 
in 
a 
glass, 
yet 
they 
do 
suddenly 
forget 
themselves; 
wherein 
as 
the 
divine 
glass 
is 
the 
Word 
of 
God, 
so 
the 
politic 
glass 
is 
the 
state 
of 
the 
world, 
or 
times 
wherein 
we 
live, 
in 
the 
which 
we 
are 
to 
behold 
ourselves. 
(24) 
For 
men 
ought 
to 
take 
an 
impartial 
view 
of 
their 
own 
abilities 
and 
virtues; 
and 
again 
of 
their 
wants 
and 
impediments; 
accounting 
these 
with 
the 
most, 
and 
those 
other 
with 
the 
least; 
and 
from 
this 
view 
and 
examination 
to 
frame 
the 
considerations 
following. 
(25) 
First, 
to 
consider 
how 
the 
constitution 
of 
their 
nature 
sorteth 
with 
the 
general 
state 
of 
the 
times; 
which 
if 
they 
find 
agreeable 
and 
fit, 
then 
in 
all 
things 
to 
give 
themselves 
more 
scope 
and 
liberty; 
but 
if 
differing 
and 
dissonant, 
then 
in 
the 
whole 
course 
of 
their 
life 
to 
be 
more 
close 
retired, 
and 
reserved; 
as 
we 
see 
in 
Tiberius, 
who 
was 
never 
seen 
at 
a 
play, 
and 
came 
not 
into 
the 
senate 
in 
twelve 
of 
his 
last 
years; 
whereas 
Augustus 
Caesar 
lived 
ever 
in 
men’s 
eyes, 
which 
Tacitus 
observeth, 
alia 
Tiberio 
morum 
via. 
(26) 
Secondly, 
to 
consider 
how 
their 
nature 
sorteth 
with 
professions 
and 
courses 
of 
life, 
and 
accordingly 
to 
make 
election, 
if 
they 
be 
free; 
and, 
if 
engaged, 
to 
make 
the 
departure 
at 
the 
first 
opportunity; 
as 
we 
see 
was 
done 
by 
Duke 
Valentine, 
that 
was 
designed 
by 
his 
father 
to 
a 
sacerdotal 
profession, 
but 
quitted 
it 
soon 
after 
in 
regard 
of 
his 
parts 
and 
inclination; 
being 
such, 
nevertheless, 
as 
a 
man 
cannot 
tell 
well 
whether 
they 
were 
worse 
for 
a 
prince 
or 
for 
a 
priest. 
(27) 
Thirdly, 
to 
consider 
how 
they 
sort 
with 
those 
whom 
they 
are 
like 
to 
have 
competitors 
and 
concurrents; 
and 
to 
take 
that 
course 
wherein 
there 
is 
most 
solitude, 
and 
themselves 
like 
to 
be 
most 
eminent; 
as 
Caesar 
Julius 
did, 
who 
at 
first 
was 
an 
orator 
or 
pleader; 
but 
when 
he 
saw 
the 
excellency 
of 
Cicero, 
Hortensius, 
Catulus, 
and 
others 
for 
eloquence, 
and 
saw 
there 
was 
no 
man 
of 
reputation 
for 
the 
wars 
but 
Pompeius, 
upon 
whom 
the 
state 
was 
forced 
to 
rely, 
he 
forsook 
his 
course 
begun 
towards 
a 
civil 
and 
popular 
greatness, 
and 
transferred 
his 
designs 
to 
a 
martial 
greatness. 

(28) 
Fourthly, 
in 
the 
choice 
of 
their 
friends 
and 
dependents, 
to 
proceed 
according 
to 
the 
composition 
of 
their 
own 
nature; 
as 
we 
may 
see 
in 
Caesar, 
all 
whose 
friends 
and 
followers 
were 
men 
active 
and 
effectual, 
but 
not 
solemn, 
or 
of 
reputation. 
(29) 
Fifthly, 
to 
take 
special 
heed 
how 
they 
guide 
themselves 
by 
examples, 
in 
thinking 
they 
can 
do 
as 
they 
see 
others 
do; 
whereas 
perhaps 
their 
natures 
and 
carriages 
are 
far 
differing. 
In 
which 
error 
it 
seemeth 
Pompey 
was, 
of 
whom 
Cicero 
saith 
that 
he 
was 
wont 
often 
to 
say, 
Sylla 
potuit, 
ego 
non 
potero? 
Wherein 
he 
was 
much 
abused, 
the 
natures 
and 
proceedings 
of 
himself 
and 
his 
example 
being 
the 
unlikest 
in 
the 
world; 
the 
one 
being 
fierce, 
violent, 
and 
pressing 
the 
fact; 
the 
other 
solemn, 
and 
full 
of 
majesty 
and 
circumstance, 
and 
therefore 
the 
less 
effectual. 
But 
this 
precept 
touching 
the 
politic 
knowledge 
of 
ourselves 
hath 
many 
other 
branches, 
whereupon 
we 
cannot 
insist. 


(30) 
Next 
to 
the 
well 
understanding 
and 
discerning 
of 
a 
man’s 
self, 
there 
followeth 
the 
well 
opening 
and 
revealing 
a 
man’s 
self; 
wherein 
we 
see 
nothing 
more 
usual 
than 
for 
the 
more 
able 
man 
to 
make 
the 
less 
show. 
For 
there 
is 
a 
great 
advantage 
in 
the 
well 
setting 
forth 
of 
a 
man’s 
virtues, 
fortunes, 
merits; 
and 
again, 
in 
the 
artificial 
covering 
of 
a 
man’s 
weaknesses, 
defects, 
disgraces; 
staying 
upon 
the 
one, 
sliding 
from 
the 
other; 
cherishing 
the 
one 
by 
circumstances, 
gracing 
the 
other 
by 
exposition, 
and 
the 
like. 
Wherein 
we 
see 
what 
Tacitus 
saith 
of 
Mutianus, 
who 
was 
the 
greatest 
politique 
of 
his 
time, 
Omnium 
quae 
dixerat 
feceratque 
arte 
quadam 
ostentator, 
which 
requireth 
indeed 
some 
art, 
lest 
it 
turn 
tedious 
and 
arrogant; 
but 
yet 
so, 
as 
ostentation 
(though 
it 
be 
to 
the 
first 
degree 
of 
vanity) 
seemeth 
to 
me 
rather 
a 
vice 
in 
manners 
than 
in 
policy; 
for 
as 
it 
is 
said, 
Audacter 
calumniare, 
semper 
aliquid 
haeret; 
so, 
except 
it 
be 
in 
a 
ridiculous 
degree 
of 
deformity, 
Audacter 
te 
vendita, 
semper 
aluquid 
haeret. 
For 
it 
will 
stick 
with 
the 
more 
ignorant 
and 
inferior 
sort 
of 
men, 
though 
men 
of 
wisdom 
and 
rank 
do 
smile 
at 
it 
and 
despise 
it; 
and 
yet 
the 
authority 
won 
with 
many 
doth 
countervail 
the 
disdain 
of 
a 
few. 
But 
if 
it 
be 
carried 
with 
decency 
and 
government, 
as 
with 
a 
natural, 
pleasant, 
and 
ingenious 
fashion; 
or 
at 
times 
when 
it 
is 
mixed 
with 
some 
peril 
and 
unsafety 
(as 
in 
military 
persons); 
or 
at 
times 
when 
others 
are 
most 
envied; 
or 
with 
easy 
and 
careless 
passage 
to 
it 
and 
from 
it, 
without 
dwelling 
too 
long, 
or 
being 
too 
serious; 
or 
with 
an 
equal 
freedom 
of 
taxing 
a 
man’s 
self, 
as 
well 
as 
gracing 
himself; 
or 
by 
occasion 
of 
repelling 
or 
putting 
down 

others’ 
injury 
or 
insolency; 
it 
doth 
greatly 
add 
to 
reputation: 
and 
surely 
not 
a 
few 
solid 
natures, 
that 
want 
this 
ventosity 
and 
cannot 
sail 
in 
the 
height 
of 
the 
winds, 
are 
not 
without 
some 
prejudice 
and 
disadvantage 
by 
their 
moderation. 


(31) 
But 
for 
these 
flourishes 
and 
enhancements 
of 
virtue, 
as 
they 
are 
not 
perchance 
unnecessary, 
so 
it 
is 
at 
least 
necessary 
that 
virtue 
be 
not 
disvalued 
and 
embased 
under 
the 
just 
price, 
which 
is 
done 
in 
three 
manners 
— 
by 
offering 
and 
obtruding 
a 
man’s 
self, 
wherein 
men 
think 
he 
is 
rewarded 
when 
he 
is 
accepted; 
by 
doing 
too 
much, 
which 
will 
not 
give 
that 
which 
is 
well 
done 
leave 
to 
settle, 
and 
in 
the 
end 
induceth 
satiety; 
and 
by 
finding 
too 
soon 
the 
fruit 
of 
a 
man’s 
virtue, 
in 
commendation, 
applause, 
honour, 
favour; 
wherein 
if 
a 
man 
be 
pleased 
with 
a 
little, 
let 
him 
hear 
what 
is 
truly 
said: 
Cave 
ne 
insuetus 
rebus 
majoribus 
videaris, 
si 
haec 
te 
res 
parva 
sicuti 
magna 
delectat. 
(32) 
But 
the 
covering 
of 
defects 
is 
of 
no 
less 
importance 
than 
the 
valuing 
of 
good 
parts; 
which 
may 
be 
done 
likewise 
in 
three 
manners 
— 
by 
caution, 
by 
colour, 
and 
by 
confidence. 
Caution 
is 
when 
men 
do 
ingeniously 
and 
discreetly 
avoid 
to 
be 
put 
into 
those 
things 
for 
which 
they 
are 
not 
proper; 
whereas 
contrariwise 
bold 
and 
unquiet 
spirits 
will 
thrust 
themselves 
into 
matters 
without 
difference, 
and 
so 
publish 
and 
proclaim 
all 
their 
wants. 
Colour 
is 
when 
men 
make 
a 
way 
for 
themselves 
to 
have 
a 
construction 
made 
of 
their 
faults 
or 
wants, 
as 
proceeding 
from 
a 
better 
cause 
or 
intended 
for 
some 
other 
purpose. 
For 
of 
the 
one 
it 
is 
well 
said, 
“Saepe 
latet 
vitium 
proximitate 
boni,” 


and 
therefore 
whatsoever 
want 
a 
man 
hath, 
he 
must 
see 
that 
he 
pretend 
the 
virtue 
that 
shadoweth 
it; 
as 
if 
he 
be 
dull, 
he 
must 
affect 
gravity; 
if 
a 
coward, 
mildness; 
and 
so 
the 
rest. 
For 
the 
second, 
a 
man 
must 
frame 
some 
probable 
cause 
why 
he 
should 
not 
do 
his 
best, 
and 
why 
he 
should 
dissemble 
his 
abilities; 
and 
for 
that 
purpose 
must 
use 
to 
dissemble 
those 
abilities 
which 
are 
notorious 
in 
him, 
to 
give 
colour 
that 
his 
true 
wants 
are 
but 
industries 
and 
dissimulations. 
For 
confidence, 
it 
is 
the 
last 
but 
the 
surest 
remedy 
— 
namely, 
to 
depress 
and 
seem 
to 
despise 
whatsoever 
a 
man 
cannot 
attain; 
observing 
the 
good 
principle 
of 
the 
merchants, 
who 
endeavour 
to 
raise 
the 
price 
of 
their 
own 
commodities, 
and 
to 
beat 
down 
the 
price 
of 
others. 
But 
there 
is 
a 
confidence 
that 
passeth 
this 
other, 
which 
is 
to 
face 
out 
a 
man’s 
own 
defects, 
in 
seeming 
to 
conceive 
that 
he 
is 
best 
in 
those 
things 
wherein 
he 
is 
failing; 



and, 
to 
help 
that 
again, 
to 
seem 
on 
the 
other 
side 
that 
he 
hath 
least 
opinion 
of 
himself 
in 
those 
things 
wherein 
he 
is 
best: 
like 
as 
we 
shall 
see 
it 
commonly 
in 
poets, 
that 
if 
they 
show 
their 
verses, 
and 
you 
except 
to 
any, 
they 
will 
say, 
“That 
that 
line 
cost 
them 
more 
labour 
than 
any 
of 
the 
rest;” 
and 
presently 
will 
seem 
to 
disable 
and 
suspect 
rather 
some 
other 
line, 
which 
they 
know 
well 
enough 
to 
be 
the 
best 
in 
the 
number. 
But 
above 
all, 
in 
this 
righting 
and 
helping 
of 
a 
man’s 
self 
in 
his 
own 
carriage, 
he 
must 
take 
heed 
he 
show 
not 
himself 
dismantled 
and 
exposed 
to 
scorn 
and 
injury, 
by 
too 
much 
dulceness, 
goodness, 
and 
facility 
of 
nature; 
but 
show 
some 
sparkles 
of 
liberty, 
spirit, 
and 
edge. 
Which 
kind 
of 
fortified 
carriage, 
with 
a 
ready 
rescussing 
of 
a 
man’s 
self 
from 
scorns, 
is 
sometimes 
of 
necessity 
imposed 
upon 
men 
by 
somewhat 
in 
their 
person 
or 
fortune; 
but 
it 
ever 
succeedeth 
with 
good 
felicity. 


(33) 
Another 
precept 
of 
this 
knowledge 
is 
by 
all 
possible 
endeavour 
to 
frame 
the 
mind 
to 
be 
pliant 
and 
obedient 
to 
occasion; 
for 
nothing 
hindereth 
men’s 
fortunes 
so 
much 
as 
this: 
Idem 
manebat, 
neque 
idem 
decebat 
— 
men 
are 
where 
they 
were, 
when 
occasions 
turn: 
and 
therefore 
to 
Cato, 
whom 
Livy 
maketh 
such 
an 
architect 
of 
fortune, 
he 
addeth 
that 
he 
had 
versatile 
ingenium. 
And 
thereof 
it 
cometh 
that 
these 
grave 
solemn 
wits, 
which 
must 
be 
like 
themselves 
and 
cannot 
make 
departures, 
have 
more 
dignity 
than 
felicity. 
But 
in 
some 
it 
is 
nature 
to 
be 
somewhat 
vicious 
and 
enwrapped, 
and 
not 
easy 
to 
turn. 
In 
some 
it 
is 
a 
conceit 
that 
is 
almost 
a 
nature, 
which 
is, 
that 
men 
can 
hardly 
make 
themselves 
believe 
that 
they 
ought 
to 
change 
their 
course, 
when 
they 
have 
found 
good 
by 
it 
in 
former 
experience. 
For 
Machiavel 
noted 
wisely 
how 
Fabius 
Maximus 
would 
have 
been 
temporising 
still, 
according 
to 
his 
old 
bias, 
when 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
war 
was 
altered 
and 
required 
hot 
pursuit. 
In 
some 
other 
it 
is 
want 
of 
point 
and 
penetration 
in 
their 
judgment, 
that 
they 
do 
not 
discern 
when 
things 
have 
a 
period, 
but 
come 
in 
too 
late 
after 
the 
occasion; 
as 
Demosthenes 
compareth 
the 
people 
of 
Athens 
to 
country 
fellows, 
when 
they 
play 
in 
a 
fence 
school, 
that 
if 
they 
have 
a 
blow, 
then 
they 
remove 
their 
weapon 
to 
that 
ward, 
and 
not 
before. 
In 
some 
other 
it 
is 
a 
lothness 
to 
lose 
labours 
passed, 
and 
a 
conceit 
that 
they 
can 
bring 
about 
occasions 
to 
their 
ply; 
and 
yet 
in 
the 
end, 
when 
they 
see 
no 
other 
remedy, 
then 
they 
come 
to 
it 
with 
disadvantage; 
as 
Tarquinius, 
that 
gave 
for 
the 
third 
part 
of 
Sibylla’s 
books 
the 
treble 
price, 
when 
he 
might 
at 
first 
have 
had 
all 
three 
for 
the 
simple. 
But 
from 
whatsoever 
root 
or 
cause 
this 
restiveness 
of 
mind 
proceedeth, 
it 
is 
a 
thing 
most 
prejudicial; 
and 
nothing 
is 
more 
politic 
than 
to 
make 
the 
wheels 
of 
our 
mind 
concentric 
and 
voluble 
with 
the 
wheels 
of 
fortune. 

(34) 
Another 
precept 
of 
this 
knowledge, 
which 
hath 
some 
affinity 
with 
that 
we 
last 
spoke 
of, 
but 
with 
difference, 
is 
that 
which 
is 
well 
expressed, 
Fatis 
accede 
deisque, 
that 
men 
do 
not 
only 
turn 
with 
the 
occasions, 
but 
also 
run 
with 
the 
occasions, 
and 
not 
strain 
their 
credit 
or 
strength 
to 
over-
hard 
or 
extreme 
points; 
but 
choose 
in 
their 
actions 
that 
which 
is 
most 
passable: 
for 
this 
will 
preserve 
men 
from 
foil, 
not 
occupy 
them 
too 
much 
about 
one 
matter, 
win 
opinion 
of 
moderation, 
please 
the 
most, 
and 
make 
a 
show 
of 
a 
perpetual 
felicity 
in 
all 
they 
undertake: 
which 
cannot 
but 
mightily 
increase 
reputation. 
(35) 
Another 
part 
of 
this 
knowledge 
seemeth 
to 
have 
some 
repugnancy 
with 
the 
former 
two, 
but 
not 
as 
I 
understand 
it; 
and 
it 
is 
that 
which 
Demosthenes 
uttereth 
in 
high 
terms: 
Et 
quemadmodum 
receptum 
est, 
ut 
exercitum 
ducat 
imperator, 
sic 
et 
a 
cordatis 
viris 
res 
ipsae 
ducendae; 
ut 
quaeipsis 
videntur, 
ea 
gerantur, 
et 
non 
ipsi 
eventus 
persequi 
cogantur. 
For 
if 
we 
observe 
we 
shall 
find 
two 
differing 
kinds 
of 
sufficiency 
in 
managing 
of 
business: 
some 
can 
make 
use 
of 
occasions 
aptly 
and 
dexterously, 
but 
plot 
little; 
some 
can 
urge 
and 
pursue 
their 
own 
plots 
well, 
but 
cannot 
accommodate 
nor 
take 
in; 
either 
of 
which 
is 
very 
imperfect 
without 
the 
other. 
(36) 
Another 
part 
of 
this 
knowledge 
is 
the 
observing 
a 
good 
mediocrity 
in 
the 
declaring 
or 
not 
declaring 
a 
man’s 
self: 
for 
although 
depth 
of 
secrecy, 
and 
making 
way 
(qualis 
est 
via 
navis 
in 
mari, 
which 
the 
French 
calleth 
sourdes 
menees, 
when 
men 
set 
things 
in 
work 
without 
opening 
themselves 
at 
all), 
be 
sometimes 
both 
prosperous 
and 
admirable; 
yet 
many 
times 
dissimulatio 
errores 
parit, 
qui 
dissimulatorem 
ipsum 
illaqueant. 
And 
therefore 
we 
see 
the 
greatest 
politiques 
have 
in 
a 
natural 
and 
free 
manner 
professed 
their 
desires, 
rather 
than 
been 
reserved 
and 
disguised 
in 
them. 
For 
so 
we 
see 
that 
Lucius 
Sylla 
made 
a 
kind 
of 
profession, 
“that 
he 
wished 
all 
men 
happy 
or 
unhappy, 
as 
they 
stood 
his 
friends 
or 
enemies.” 
So 
Caesar, 
when 
he 
went 
first 
into 
Gaul, 
made 
no 
scruple 
to 
profess 
“that 
he 
had 
rather 
be 
first 
in 
a 
village 
than 
second 
at 
Rome.” 
So 
again, 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
had 
begun 
the 
war, 
we 
see 
what 
Cicero 
saith 
of 
him, 
Alter 
(meaning 
of 
Caesar) 
non 
recusat, 
sed 
quodammodo 
postulat, 
ut 
(ut 
est) 
sic 
appelletur 
tyrannus. 
So 
we 
may 
see 
in 
a 
letter 
of 
Cicero 
to 
Atticus, 
that 
Augustus 
Caesar, 
in 
his 
very 
entrance 
into 
affairs, 
when 
he 
was 
a 
darling 
of 
the 
senate, 
yet 
in 
his 
harangues 
to 
the 
people 
would 
swear, 
Ita 
parentis 
honores 
consequi 
liceat 
(which 
was 
no 
less 
than 
the 
tyranny), 
save 
that, 
to 
help 
it, 
he 
would 
stretch 

forth 
his 
hand 
towards 
a 
statue 
of 
Caesar’s 
that 
was 
erected 
in 
the 
place: 
and 
men 
laughed 
and 
wondered, 
and 
said, 
“Is 
it 
possible?” 
or, 
“Did 
you 
ever 
hear 
the 
like?” 
and 
yet 
thought 
he 
meant 
no 
hurt; 
he 
did 
it 
so 
handsomely 
and 
ingenuously. 
And 
all 
these 
were 
prosperous: 
whereas 
Pompey, 
who 
tended 
to 
the 
same 
ends, 
but 
in 
a 
more 
dark 
and 
dissembling 
manner 
as 
Tacitus 
saith 
of 
him, 
Occultior 
non 
melior, 
wherein 
Sallust 
concurreth, 
Ore 
probo, 
animo 
inverecundo, 
made 
it 
his 
design, 
by 
infinite 
secret 
engines, 
to 
cast 
the 
state 
into 
an 
absolute 
anarchy 
and 
confusion, 
that 
the 
state 
might 
cast 
itself 
into 
his 
arms 
for 
necessity 
and 
protection, 
and 
so 
the 
sovereign 
power 
be 
put 
upon 
him, 
and 
he 
never 
seen 
in 
it: 
and 
when 
he 
had 
brought 
it 
(as 
he 
thought) 
to 
that 
point 
when 
he 
was 
chosen 
consul 
alone, 
as 
never 
any 
was, 
yet 
he 
could 
make 
no 
great 
matter 
of 
it, 
because 
men 
understood 
him 
not; 
but 
was 
fain 
in 
the 
end 
to 
go 
the 
beaten 
track 
of 
getting 
arms 
into 
his 
hands, 
by 
colour 
of 
the 
doubt 
of 
Caesar’s 
designs: 
so 
tedious, 
casual, 
and 
unfortunate 
are 
these 
deep 
dissimulations: 
whereof 
it 
seemeth 
Tacitus 
made 
this 
judgment, 
that 
they 
were 
a 
cunning 
of 
an 
inferior 
form 
in 
regard 
of 
true 
policy; 
attributing 
the 
one 
to 
Augustus, 
the 
other 
to 
Tiberius; 
where, 
speaking 
of 
Livia, 
he 
saith, 
Et 
cum 
artibus 
mariti 
simulatione 
filii 
bene 
compostia: 
for 
surely 
the 
continual 
habit 
of 
dissimulation 
is 
but 
a 
weak 
and 
sluggish 
cunning, 
and 
not 
greatly 
politic. 


(37) 
Another 
precept 
of 
this 
architecture 
of 
fortune 
is 
to 
accustom 
our 
minds 
to 
judge 
of 
the 
proportion 
or 
value 
of 
things, 
as 
they 
conduce 
and 
are 
material 
to 
our 
particular 
ends; 
and 
that 
to 
do 
substantially 
and 
not 
superficially. 
For 
we 
shall 
find 
the 
logical 
part 
(as 
I 
may 
term 
it) 
of 
some 
men’s 
minds 
good, 
but 
the 
mathematical 
part 
erroneous; 
that 
is, 
they 
can 
well 
judge 
of 
consequences, 
but 
not 
of 
proportions 
and 
comparison, 
preferring 
things 
of 
show 
and 
sense 
before 
things 
of 
substance 
and 
effect. 
So 
some 
fall 
in 
love 
with 
access 
to 
princes, 
others 
with 
popular 
fame 
and 
applause, 
supposing 
they 
are 
things 
of 
great 
purchase, 
when 
in 
many 
cases 
they 
are 
but 
matters 
of 
envy, 
peril, 
and 
impediment. 
So 
some 
measure 
things 
according 
to 
the 
labour 
and 
difficulty 
or 
assiduity 
which 
are 
spent 
about 
them; 
and 
think, 
if 
they 
be 
ever 
moving, 
that 
they 
must 
needs 
advance 
and 
proceed; 
as 
Caesar 
saith 
in 
a 
despising 
manner 
of 
Cato 
the 
second, 
when 
he 
describeth 
how 
laborious 
and 
indefatigable 
he 
was 
to 
no 
great 
purpose, 
Haec 
omnia 
magno 
studio 
agebat. 
So 
in 
most 
things 
men 
are 
ready 
to 
abuse 
themselves 
in 
thinking 
the 
greatest 
means 
to 
be 
best, 
when 
it 
should 
be 
the 
fittest. 
(38) 
As 
for 
the 
true 
marshalling 
of 
men’s 
pursuits 
towards 
their 

fortune, 
as 
they 
are 
more 
or 
less 
material, 
I 
hold 
them 
to 
stand 
thus. 
First 
the 
amendment 
of 
their 
own 
minds. 
For 
the 
removal 
of 
the 
impediments 
of 
the 
mind 
will 
sooner 
clear 
the 
passages 
of 
fortune 
than 
the 
obtaining 
fortune 
will 
remove 
the 
impediments 
of 
the 
mind. 
In 
the 
second 
place 
I 
set 
down 
wealth 
and 
means; 
which 
I 
know 
most 
men 
would 
have 
placed 
first, 
because 
of 
the 
general 
use 
which 
it 
beareth 
towards 
all 
variety 
of 
occasions. 
But 
that 
opinion 
I 
may 
condemn 
with 
like 
reason 
as 
Machiavel 
doth 
that 
other, 
that 
moneys 
were 
the 
sinews 
of 
the 
wars; 
whereas 
(saith 
he) 
the 
true 
sinews 
of 
the 
wars 
are 
the 
sinews 
of 
men’s 
arms, 
that 
is, 
a 
valiant, 
populous, 
and 
military 
nation: 
and 
he 
voucheth 
aptly 
the 
authority 
of 
Solon, 
who, 
when 
Croesus 
showed 
him 
his 
treasury 
of 
gold, 
said 
to 
him, 
that 
if 
another 
came 
that 
had 
better 
iron, 
he 
would 
be 
master 
of 
his 
gold. 
In 
like 
manner 
it 
may 
be 
truly 
affirmed 
that 
it 
is 
not 
moneys 
that 
are 
the 
sinews 
of 
fortune, 
but 
it 
is 
the 
sinews 
and 
steel 
of 
men’s 
minds, 
wit, 
courage, 
audacity, 
resolution, 
temper, 
industry, 
and 
the 
like. 
In 
the 
third 
place 
I 
set 
down 
reputation, 
because 
of 
the 
peremptory 
tides 
and 
currents 
it 
hath; 
which, 
if 
they 
be 
not 
taken 
in 
their 
due 
time, 
are 
seldom 
recovered, 
it 
being 
extreme 
hard 
to 
play 
an 
after-game 
of 
reputation. 
And 
lastly 
I 
place 
honour, 
which 
is 
more 
easily 
won 
by 
any 
of 
the 
other 
three, 
much 
more 
by 
all, 
than 
any 
of 
them 
can 
be 
purchased 
by 
honour. 
To 
conclude 
this 
precept, 
as 
there 
is 
order 
and 
priority 
in 
matter, 
so 
is 
there 
in 
time, 
the 
preposterous 
placing 
whereof 
is 
one 
of 
the 
commonest 
errors: 
while 
men 
fly 
to 
their 
ends 
when 
they 
should 
intend 
their 
beginnings, 
and 
do 
not 
take 
things 
in 
order 
of 
time 
as 
they 
come 
on, 
but 
marshal 
them 
according 
to 
greatness 
and 
not 
according 
to 
instance; 
not 
observing 
the 
good 
precept, 
Quod 
nunc 
instat 
agamus. 


(39) 
Another 
precept 
of 
this 
knowledge 
is 
not 
to 
embrace 
any 
matters 
which 
do 
occupy 
too 
great 
a 
quantity 
of 
time, 
but 
to 
have 
that 
sounding 
in 
a 
man’s 
ears, 
Sed 
fugit 
interea 
fugit 
irreparabile 
tempus: 
and 
that 
is 
the 
cause 
why 
those 
which 
take 
their 
course 
of 
rising 
by 
professions 
of 
burden, 
as 
lawyers, 
orators, 
painful 
divines, 
and 
the 
like, 
are 
not 
commonly 
so 
politic 
for 
their 
own 
fortune, 
otherwise 
than 
in 
their 
ordinary 
way, 
because 
they 
want 
time 
to 
learn 
particulars, 
to 
wait 
occasions, 
and 
to 
devise 
plots. 
(40) 
Another 
precept 
of 
this 
knowledge 
is 
to 
imitate 
nature, 
which 
doth 
nothing 
in 
vain; 
which 
surely 
a 
man 
may 
do 
if 
he 
do 
well 
interlace 
his 
business, 
and 
bend 
not 
his 
mind 
too 
much 
upon 
that 
which 
he 
principally 
intendeth. 
For 
a 
man 
ought 
in 
every 
particular 
action 
so 
to 
carry 
the 
motions 

of 
his 
mind, 
and 
so 
to 
have 
one 
thing 
under 
another, 
as 
if 
he 
cannot 
have 
that 
he 
seeketh 
in 
the 
best 
degree, 
yet 
to 
have 
it 
in 
a 
second, 
or 
so 
in 
a 
third; 
and 
if 
he 
can 
have 
no 
part 
of 
that 
which 
he 
purposed, 
yet 
to 
turn 
the 
use 
of 
it 
to 
somewhat 
else; 
and 
if 
he 
cannot 
make 
anything 
of 
it 
for 
the 
present, 
yet 
to 
make 
it 
as 
a 
seed 
of 
somewhat 
in 
time 
to 
come; 
and 
if 
he 
can 
contrive 
no 
effect 
or 
substance 
from 
it, 
yet 
to 
win 
some 
good 
opinion 
by 
it, 
or 
the 
like. 
So 
that 
he 
should 
exact 
an 
account 
of 
himself 
of 
every 
action, 
to 
reap 
somewhat, 
and 
not 
to 
stand 
amazed 
and 
confused 
if 
he 
fail 
of 
that 
he 
chiefly 
meant: 
for 
nothing 
is 
more 
impolitic 
than 
to 
mind 
actions 
wholly 
one 
by 
one. 
For 
he 
that 
doth 
so 
loseth 
infinite 
occasions 
which 
intervene, 
and 
are 
many 
times 
more 
proper 
and 
propitious 
for 
somewhat 
that 
he 
shall 
need 
afterwards, 
than 
for 
that 
which 
he 
urgeth 
for 
the 
present; 
and 
therefore 
men 
must 
be 
perfect 
in 
that 
rule, 
Haec 
oportet 
facere, 
et 
illa 
non 
imittere. 


(41) 
Another 
precept 
of 
this 
knowledge 
is, 
not 
to 
engage 
a 
man’s 
self 
peremptorily 
in 
anything, 
though 
it 
seem 
not 
liable 
to 
accident; 
but 
ever 
to 
have 
a 
window 
to 
fly 
out 
at, 
or 
a 
way 
to 
retire: 
following 
the 
wisdom 
in 
the 
ancient 
fable 
of 
the 
two 
frogs, 
which 
consulted 
when 
their 
plash 
was 
dry 
whither 
they 
should 
go; 
and 
the 
one 
moved 
to 
go 
down 
into 
a 
pit, 
because 
it 
was 
not 
likely 
the 
water 
would 
dry 
there; 
but 
the 
other 
answered, 
“True, 
but 
if 
it 
do, 
how 
shall 
we 
get 
out 
again?” 
(42) 
Another 
precept 
of 
this 
knowledge 
is 
that 
ancient 
precept 
of 
Bias, 
construed 
not 
to 
any 
point 
of 
perfidiousness, 
but 
to 
caution 
and 
moderation, 
Et 
ama 
tanquam 
inimicus 
futurus 
et 
odi 
tanquam 
amaturus. 
For 
it 
utterly 
betrayeth 
all 
utility 
for 
men 
to 
embark 
themselves 
too 
far 
into 
unfortunate 
friendships, 
troublesome 
spleens, 
and 
childish 
and 
humorous 
envies 
or 
emulations. 
(43) 
But 
I 
continue 
this 
beyond 
the 
measure 
of 
an 
example; 
led, 
because 
I 
would 
not 
have 
such 
knowledges, 
which 
I 
note 
as 
deficient, 
to 
be 
thought 
things 
imaginative 
or 
in 
the 
air, 
or 
an 
observation 
or 
two 
much 
made 
of, 
but 
things 
of 
bulk 
and 
mass, 
whereof 
an 
end 
is 
more 
hardly 
made 
than 
a 
beginning. 
It 
must 
be 
likewise 
conceived, 
that 
in 
these 
points 
which 
I 
mention 
and 
set 
down, 
they 
are 
far 
from 
complete 
tractates 
of 
them, 
but 
only 
as 
small 
pieces 
for 
patterns. 
And 
lastly, 
no 
man 
I 
suppose 
will 
think 
that 
I 
mean 
fortunes 
are 
not 
obtained 
without 
all 
this 
ado; 
for 
I 
know 
they 
come 
tumbling 
into 
some 
men’s 
laps; 
and 
a 
number 
obtain 
good 
fortunes 
by 
diligence 
in 
a 
plain 
way, 
little 
intermeddling, 
and 
keeping 
themselves 
from 

gross 
errors. 


(44) 
But 
as 
Cicero, 
when 
he 
setteth 
down 
an 
idea 
of 
a 
perfect 
orator, 
doth 
not 
mean 
that 
every 
pleader 
should 
be 
such; 
and 
so 
likewise, 
when 
a 
prince 
or 
a 
courtier 
hath 
been 
described 
by 
such 
as 
have 
handled 
those 
subjects, 
the 
mould 
hath 
used 
to 
be 
made 
according 
to 
the 
perfection 
of 
the 
art, 
and 
not 
according 
to 
common 
practice: 
so 
I 
understand 
it, 
that 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
done 
in 
the 
description 
of 
a 
politic 
man, 
I 
mean 
politic 
for 
his 
own 
fortune. 
(45) 
But 
it 
must 
be 
remembered 
all 
this 
while, 
that 
the 
precepts 
which 
we 
have 
set 
down 
are 
of 
that 
kind 
which 
may 
be 
counted 
and 
called 
Bonae 
Artes. 
As 
for 
evil 
arts, 
if 
a 
man 
would 
set 
down 
for 
himself 
that 
principle 
of 
Machiavel, 
“That 
a 
man 
seek 
not 
to 
attain 
virtue 
itself, 
but 
the 
appearance 
only 
thereof; 
because 
the 
credit 
of 
virtue 
is 
a 
help, 
but 
the 
use 
of 
it 
is 
cumber:” 
or 
that 
other 
of 
his 
principles, 
“That 
he 
presuppose 
that 
men 
are 
not 
fitly 
to 
be 
wrought 
otherwise 
but 
by 
fear; 
and 
therefore 
that 
he 
seek 
to 
have 
every 
man 
obnoxious, 
low, 
and 
in 
straits,” 
which 
the 
Italians 
call 
seminar 
spine, 
to 
sow 
thorns: 
or 
that 
other 
principle, 
contained 
in 
the 
verse 
which 
Cicero 
citeth, 
Cadant 
amici, 
dummodo 
inimici 
intercidant, 
as 
the 
triumvirs, 
which 
sold 
every 
one 
to 
other 
the 
lives 
of 
their 
friends 
for 
the 
deaths 
of 
their 
enemies: 
or 
that 
other 
protestation 
of 
L. 
Catilina, 
to 
set 
on 
fire 
and 
trouble 
states, 
to 
the 
end 
to 
fish 
in 
droumy 
waters, 
and 
to 
unwrap 
their 
fortunes, 
Ego 
si 
quid 
in 
fortunis 
meis 
excitatum 
sit 
incendium, 
id 
non 
aqua 
sed 
ruina 
restinguam: 
or 
that 
other 
principle 
of 
Lysander, 
“That 
children 
are 
to 
be 
deceived 
with 
comfits, 
and 
men 
with 
oaths:” 
and 
the 
like 
evil 
and 
corrupt 
positions, 
whereof 
(as 
in 
all 
things) 
there 
are 
more 
in 
number 
than 
of 
the 
good: 
certainly 
with 
these 
dispensations 
from 
the 
laws 
of 
charity 
and 
integrity, 
the 
pressing 
of 
a 
man’s 
fortune 
may 
be 
more 
hasty 
and 
compendious. 
But 
it 
is 
in 
life 
as 
it 
is 
in 
ways, 
the 
shortest 
way 
is 
commonly 
the 
foulest, 
and 
surely 
the 
fairer 
way 
is 
not 
much 
about. 
(46) 
But 
men, 
if 
they 
be 
in 
their 
own 
power, 
and 
do 
bear 
and 
sustain 
themselves, 
and 
be 
not 
carried 
away 
with 
a 
whirlwind 
or 
tempest 
of 
ambition, 
ought 
in 
the 
pursuit 
of 
their 
own 
fortune 
to 
set 
before 
their 
eyes 
not 
only 
that 
general 
map 
of 
the 
world, 
“That 
all 
things 
are 
vanity 
and 
vexation 
of 
spirit,” 
but 
many 
other 
more 
particular 
cards 
and 
directions: 
chiefly 
that, 
that 
being 
without 
well-being 
is 
a 
curse, 
and 
the 
greater 
being 
the 
greater 
curse; 
and 
that 
all 
virtue 
is 
most 
rewarded 
and 
all 
wickedness 
most 
punished 
in 
itself: 
according 
as 
the 
poet 
saith 
excellently:— 

“Quae 
vobis, 
quae 
digna, 
viri 
pro 
laudibus 
istis 
Praemia 
posse 
rear 
solvi? 
pulcherrima 
primum 
Dii 
moresque 
dabunt 
vestri.” 


And 
so 
of 
the 
contrary. 
And 
secondly 
they 
ought 
to 
look 
up 
to 
the 
Eternal 
Providence 
and 
Divine 
Judgment, 
which 
often 
subverteth 
the 
wisdom 
of 
evil 
plots 
and 
imaginations, 
according 
to 
that 
scripture, 
“He 
hath 
conceived 
mischief, 
and 
shall 
bring 
forth 
a 
vain 
thing.” 
And 
although 
men 
should 
refrain 
themselves 
from 
injury 
and 
evil 
arts, 
yet 
this 
incessant 
and 
Sabbathless 
pursuit 
of 
a 
man’s 
fortune 
leaveth 
not 
tribute 
which 
we 
owe 
to 
God 
of 
our 
time; 
who 
(we 
see) 
demandeth 
a 
tenth 
of 
our 
substance, 
and 
a 
seventh, 
which 
is 
more 
strict, 
of 
our 
time: 
and 
it 
is 
to 
small 
purpose 
to 
have 
an 
erected 
face 
towards 
heaven, 
and 
a 
perpetual 
grovelling 
spirit 
upon 
earth, 
eating 
dust 
as 
doth 
the 
serpent, 
Atque 
affigit 
humo 
divinae 
particulam 
aurae. 
And 
if 
any 
man 
flatter 
himself 
that 
he 
will 
employ 
his 
fortune 
well, 
though 
he 
should 
obtain 
it 
ill, 
as 
was 
said 
concerning 
Augustus 
Caesar, 
and 
after 
of 
Septimius 
Severus, 
“That 
either 
they 
should 
never 
have 
been 
born, 
or 
else 
they 
should 
never 
have 
died,” 
they 
did 
so 
much 
mischief 
in 
the 
pursuit 
and 
ascent 
of 
their 
greatness, 
and 
so 
much 
good 
when 
they 
were 
established; 
yet 
these 
compensations 
and 
satisfactions 
are 
good 
to 
be 
used, 
but 
never 
good 
to 
be 
purposed. 
And 
lastly, 
it 
is 
not 
amiss 
for 
men, 
in 
their 
race 
towards 
their 
fortune, 
to 
cool 
themselves 
a 
little 
with 
that 
conceit 
which 
is 
elegantly 
expressed 
by 
the 
Emperor 
Charles 
V., 
in 
his 
instructions 
to 
the 
king 
his 
son, 
“That 
fortune 
hath 
somewhat 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
woman, 
that 
if 
she 
he 
too 
much 
wooed 
she 
is 
the 
farther 
off.” 
But 
this 
last 
is 
but 
a 
remedy 
for 
those 
whose 
tastes 
are 
corrupted: 
let 
men 
rather 
build 
upon 
that 
foundation 
which 
is 
as 
a 
corner-stone 
of 
divinity 
and 
philosophy, 
wherein 
they 
join 
close, 
namely 
that 
same 
Primum 
quaerite. 
For 
divinity 
saith, 
Primum 
quaerite 
regnum 
Dei, 
et 
ista 
omnia 
adjicientur 
vobis: 
and 
philosophy 
saith, 
Primum 
quaerite 
bona 
animi; 
caetera 
aut 
aderunt, 
aut 
non 
oberunt. 
And 
although 
the 
human 
foundation 
hath 
somewhat 
of 
the 
sands, 
as 
we 
see 
in 
M. 
Brutus, 
when 
he 
broke 
forth 
into 
that 
speech, 


“Te 
colui 
(Virtus) 
ut 
rem; 
ast 
tu 
nomen 
inane 
es;” 


yet 
the 
divine 
foundation 
is 
upon 
the 
rock. 
But 
this 
may 
serve 
for 
a 
taste 
of 
that 
knowledge 
which 
I 
noted 
as 
deficient. 


(47) 
Concerning 
government, 
it 
is 
a 
part 
of 
knowledge 
secret 
and 
retired 
in 
both 
these 
respects 
in 
which 
things 
are 
deemed 
secret; 
for 
some 

things 
are 
secret 
because 
they 
are 
hard 
to 
know, 
and 
some 
because 
they 
are 
not 
fit 
to 
utter. 
We 
see 
all 
governments 
are 
obscure 
and 
invisible:— 


“Totamque 
infusa 
per 
artus 
Mens 
agitat 
molem, 
et 
magno 
se 
corpore 
miscet.” 


Such 
is 
the 
description 
of 
governments. 
We 
see 
the 
government 
of 
God 
over 
the 
world 
is 
hidden, 
insomuch 
as 
it 
seemeth 
to 
participate 
of 
much 
irregularity 
and 
confusion. 
The 
government 
of 
the 
soul 
in 
moving 
the 
body 
is 
inward 
and 
profound, 
and 
the 
passages 
thereof 
hardly 
to 
be 
reduced 
to 
demonstration. 
Again, 
the 
wisdom 
of 
antiquity 
(the 
shadows 
whereof 
are 
in 
the 
poets) 
in 
the 
description 
of 
torments 
and 
pains, 
next 
unto 
the 
crime 
of 
rebellion, 
which 
was 
the 
giants’ 
offence, 
doth 
detest 
the 
offence 
of 
futility, 
as 
in 
Sisyphus 
and 
Tantalus. 
But 
this 
was 
meant 
of 
particulars: 
nevertheless 
even 
unto 
the 
general 
rules 
and 
discourses 
of 
policy 
and 
government 
there 
is 
due 
a 
reverent 
and 
reserved 
handling. 


(48) 
But 
contrariwise 
in 
the 
governors 
towards 
the 
governed, 
all 
things 
ought 
as 
far 
as 
the 
frailty 
of 
man 
permitteth 
to 
be 
manifest 
and 
revealed. 
For 
so 
it 
is 
expressed 
in 
the 
Scriptures 
touching 
the 
government 
of 
God, 
that 
this 
globe, 
which 
seemeth 
to 
us 
a 
dark 
and 
shady 
body, 
is 
in 
the 
view 
of 
God 
as 
crystal: 
Et 
in 
conspectu 
sedis 
tanquam 
mare 
vitreum 
simile 
crystallo. 
So 
unto 
princes 
and 
states, 
and 
specially 
towards 
wise 
senates 
and 
councils, 
the 
natures 
and 
dispositions 
of 
the 
people, 
their 
conditions 
and 
necessities, 
their 
factions 
and 
combinations, 
their 
animosities 
and 
discontents, 
ought 
to 
be, 
in 
regard 
of 
the 
variety 
of 
their 
intelligences, 
the 
wisdom 
of 
their 
observations, 
and 
the 
height 
of 
their 
station 
where 
they 
keep 
sentinel, 
in 
great 
part 
clear 
and 
transparent. 
Wherefore, 
considering 
that 
I 
write 
to 
a 
king 
that 
is 
a 
master 
of 
this 
science, 
and 
is 
so 
well 
assisted, 
I 
think 
it 
decent 
to 
pass 
over 
this 
part 
in 
silence, 
as 
willing 
to 
obtain 
the 
certificate 
which 
one 
of 
the 
ancient 
philosophers 
aspired 
unto; 
who 
being 
silent, 
when 
others 
contended 
to 
make 
demonstration 
of 
their 
abilities 
by 
speech, 
desired 
it 
might 
be 
certified 
for 
his 
part, 
“That 
there 
was 
one 
that 
knew 
how 
to 
hold 
his 
peace.” 
(49) 
Notwithstanding, 
for 
the 
more 
public 
part 
of 
government, 
which 
is 
laws, 
I 
think 
good 
to 
note 
only 
one 
deficiency; 
which 
is, 
that 
all 
those 
which 
have 
written 
of 
laws 
have 
written 
either 
as 
philosophers 
or 
as 
lawyers, 
and 
none 
as 
statesmen. 
As 
for 
the 
philosophers, 
they 
make 
imaginary 
laws 
for 
imaginary 
commonwealths, 
and 
their 
discourses 
are 
as 
the 
stars, 
which 

give 
little 
light 
because 
they 
are 
so 
high. 
For 
the 
lawyers, 
they 
write 
according 
to 
the 
states 
where 
they 
live 
what 
is 
received 
law, 
and 
not 
what 
ought 
to 
be 
law; 
for 
the 
wisdom 
of 
a 
law-maker 
is 
one, 
and 
of 
a 
lawyer 
is 
another. 
For 
there 
are 
in 
nature 
certain 
fountains 
of 
justice 
whence 
all 
civil 
laws 
are 
derived 
but 
as 
streams; 
and 
like 
as 
waters 
do 
take 
tinctures 
and 
tastes 
from 
the 
soils 
through 
which 
they 
run, 
so 
do 
civil 
laws 
vary 
according 
to 
the 
regions 
and 
governments 
where 
they 
are 
planted, 
though 
they 
proceed 
from 
the 
same 
fountains. 
Again, 
the 
wisdom 
of 
a 
law-maker 
consisteth 
not 
only 
in 
a 
platform 
of 
justice, 
but 
in 
the 
application 
thereof; 
taking 
into 
consideration 
by 
what 
means 
laws 
may 
be 
made 
certain, 
and 
what 
are 
the 
causes 
and 
remedies 
of 
the 
doubtfulness 
and 
uncertainty 
of 
law; 
by 
what 
means 
laws 
may 
be 
made 
apt 
and 
easy 
to 
be 
executed, 
and 
what 
are 
the 
impediments 
and 
remedies 
in 
the 
execution 
of 
laws; 
what 
influence 
laws 
touching 
private 
right 
of 
meum 
and 
tuum 
have 
into 
the 
public 
state, 
and 
how 
they 
may 
be 
made 
apt 
and 
agreeable; 
how 
laws 
are 
to 
be 
penned 
and 
delivered, 
whether 
in 
texts 
or 
in 
Acts, 
brief 
or 
large, 
with 
preambles 
or 
without; 
how 
they 
are 
to 
be 
pruned 
and 
reformed 
from 
time 
to 
time, 
and 
what 
is 
the 
best 
means 
to 
keep 
them 
from 
being 
too 
vast 
in 
volume, 
or 
too 
full 
of 
multiplicity 
and 
crossness; 
how 
they 
are 
to 
be 
expounded, 
when 
upon 
causes 
emergent 
and 
judicially 
discussed, 
and 
when 
upon 
responses 
and 
conferences 
touching 
general 
points 
or 
questions; 
how 
they 
are 
to 
be 
pressed, 
rigorously 
or 
tenderly; 
how 
they 
are 
to 
be 
mitigated 
by 
equity 
and 
good 
conscience, 
and 
whether 
discretion 
and 
strict 
law 
are 
to 
be 
mingled 
in 
the 
same 
courts, 
or 
kept 
apart 
in 
several 
courts; 
again, 
how 
the 
practice, 
profession, 
and 
erudition 
of 
law 
is 
to 
be 
censured 
and 
governed; 
and 
many 
other 
points 
touching 
the 
administration 
and 
(as 
I 
may 
term 
it) 
animation 
of 
laws. 
Upon 
which 
I 
insist 
the 
less, 
because 
I 
purpose 
(if 
God 
give 
me 
leave), 
having 
begun 
a 
work 
of 
this 
nature 
in 
aphorisms, 
to 
propound 
it 
hereafter, 
noting 
it 
in 
the 
meantime 
for 
deficient. 


(50) 
And 
for 
your 
Majesty’s 
laws 
of 
England, 
I 
could 
say 
much 
of 
their 
dignity, 
and 
somewhat 
of 
their 
defect; 
but 
they 
cannot 
but 
excel 
the 
civil 
laws 
in 
fitness 
for 
the 
government, 
for 
the 
civil 
law 
was 
nonhos 
quaesitum 
munus 
in 
usus; 
it 
was 
not 
made 
for 
the 
countries 
which 
it 
governeth. 
Hereof 
I 
cease 
to 
speak 
because 
I 
will 
not 
intermingle 
matter 
of 
action 
with 
matter 
of 
general 
learning. 

 
XXIV 


Thus 
have 
I 
concluded 
this 
portion 
of 
learning 
touching 
civil 
knowledge; 
and 
with 
civil 
knowledge 
have 
concluded 
human 
philosophy; 
and 
with 
human 
philosophy, 
philosophy 
in 
general. 
And 
being 
now 
at 
some 
pause, 
looking 
back 
into 
that 
I 
have 
passed 
through, 
this 
writing 
seemeth 
to 
me 
(si 
nunquam 
fallit 
imago), 
as 
far 
as 
a 
man 
can 
judge 
of 
his 
own 
work, 
not 
much 
better 
than 
that 
noise 
or 
sound 
which 
musicians 
make 
while 
they 
are 
in 
tuning 
their 
instruments, 
which 
is 
nothing 
pleasant 
to 
hear, 
but 
yet 
is 
a 
cause 
why 
the 
music 
is 
sweeter 
afterwards. 
So 
have 
I 
been 
content 
to 
tune 
the 
instruments 
of 
the 
Muses, 
that 
they 
may 
play 
that 
have 
better 
hands. 
And 
surely, 
when 
I 
set 
before 
me 
the 
condition 
of 
these 
times, 
in 
which 
learning 
hath 
made 
her 
third 
visitation 
or 
circuit 
in 
all 
the 
qualities 
thereof; 
as 
the 
excellency 
and 
vivacity 
of 
the 
wits 
of 
this 
age; 
the 
noble 
helps 
and 
lights 
which 
we 
have 
by 
the 
travails 
of 
ancient 
writers; 
the 
art 
of 
printing, 
which 
communicateth 
books 
to 
men 
of 
all 
fortunes; 
the 
openness 
of 
the 
world 
by 
navigation, 
which 
hath 
disclosed 
multitudes 
of 
experiments, 
and 
a 
mass 
of 
natural 
history; 
the 
leisure 
wherewith 
these 
times 
abound, 
not 
employing 
men 
so 
generally 
in 
civil 
business, 
as 
the 
states 
of 
Graecia 
did, 
in 
respect 
of 
their 
popularity, 
and 
the 
state 
of 
Rome, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
greatness 
of 
their 
monarchy; 
the 
present 
disposition 
of 
these 
times 
at 
this 
instant 
to 
peace; 
the 
consumption 
of 
all 
that 
ever 
can 
be 
said 
in 
controversies 
of 
religion, 
which 
have 
so 
much 
diverted 
men 
from 
other 
sciences; 
the 
perfection 
of 
your 
Majesty’s 
learning, 
which 
as 
a 
phoenix 
may 
call 
whole 
volleys 
of 
wits 
to 
follow 
you; 
and 
the 
inseparable 
propriety 
of 
time, 
which 
is 
ever 
more 
and 
more 
to 
disclose 
truth; 
I 
cannot 
but 
be 
raised 
to 
this 
persuasion, 
that 
this 
third 
period 
of 
time 
will 
far 
surpass 
that 
of 
the 
Grecian 
and 
Roman 
learning; 
only 
if 
men 
will 
know 
their 
own 
strength 
and 
their 
own 
weakness 
both; 
and 
take, 
one 
from 
the 
other, 
light 
of 
invention, 
and 
not 
fire 
of 
contradiction; 
and 
esteem 
of 
the 
inquisition 
of 
truth 
as 
of 
an 
enterprise, 
and 
not 
as 
of 
a 
quality 
or 
ornament; 
and 
employ 
wit 
and 
magnificence 
to 
things 
of 
worth 
and 
excellency, 
and 
not 
to 
things 
vulgar 
and 
of 
popular 
estimation. 
As 
for 
my 
labours, 
if 
any 
man 
shall 
please 
himself 
or 
others 
in 
the 
reprehension 
of 
them, 
they 
shall 
make 
that 
ancient 
and 
patient 
request, 
Verbera, 
sed 
audi: 
let 
men 



reprehend 
them, 
so 
they 
observe 
and 
weigh 
them. 
For 
the 
appeal 
is 
lawful 
(though 
it 
may 
be 
it 
shall 
not 
be 
needful) 
from 
the 
first 
cogitations 
of 
men 
to 
their 
second, 
and 
from 
the 
nearer 
times 
to 
the 
times 
further 
off. 
Now 
let 
us 
come 
to 
that 
learning, 
which 
both 
the 
former 
times 
were 
not 
so 
blessed 
as 
to 
know, 
sacred 
and 
inspired 
divinity, 
the 
Sabbath 
and 
port 
of 
all 
men’s 
labours 
and 
peregrinations. 



XXV 


(1) 
The 
prerogative 
of 
God 
extendeth 
as 
well 
to 
the 
reason 
as 
to 
the 
will 
of 
man: 
so 
that 
as 
we 
are 
to 
obey 
His 
law, 
though 
we 
find 
a 
reluctation 
in 
our 
will, 
so 
we 
are 
to 
believe 
His 
word, 
though 
we 
find 
a 
reluctation 
in 
our 
reason. 
For 
if 
we 
believe 
only 
that 
which 
is 
agreeable 
to 
our 
sense 
we 
give 
consent 
to 
the 
matter, 
and 
not 
to 
the 
author; 
which 
is 
no 
more 
than 
we 
would 
do 
towards 
a 
suspected 
and 
discredited 
witness; 
but 
that 
faith 
which 
was 
accounted 
to 
Abraham 
for 
righteousness 
was 
of 
such 
a 
point 
as 
whereat 
Sarah 
laughed, 
who 
therein 
was 
an 
image 
of 
natural 
reason. 
(2) 
Howbeit 
(if 
we 
will 
truly 
consider 
of 
it) 
more 
worthy 
it 
is 
to 
believe 
than 
to 
know 
as 
we 
now 
know. 
For 
in 
knowledge 
man’s 
mind 
suffereth 
from 
sense: 
but 
in 
belief 
it 
suffereth 
from 
spirit, 
such 
one 
as 
it 
holdeth 
for 
more 
authorised 
than 
itself 
and 
so 
suffereth 
from 
the 
worthier 
agent. 
Otherwise 
it 
is 
of 
the 
state 
of 
man 
glorified; 
for 
then 
faith 
shall 
cease, 
and 
we 
shall 
know 
as 
we 
are 
known. 
(3) 
Wherefore 
we 
conclude 
that 
sacred 
theology 
(which 
in 
our 
idiom 
we 
call 
divinity) 
is 
grounded 
only 
upon 
the 
word 
and 
oracle 
of 
God, 
and 
not 
upon 
the 
light 
of 
nature: 
for 
it 
is 
written, 
Caeli 
enarrant 
gloriam 
Dei; 
but 
it 
is 
not 
written, 
Caeli 
enarrant 
voluntatem 
Dei: 
but 
of 
that 
it 
is 
said, 
Ad 
legem 
et 
testimonium: 
si 
non 
fecerint 
secundum 
verbum 
istud, 
&c. 
This 
holdeth 
not 
only 
in 
those 
points 
of 
faith 
which 
concern 
the 
great 
mysteries 
of 
the 
Deity, 
of 
the 
creation, 
of 
the 
redemption, 
but 
likewise 
those 
which 
concern 
the 
law 
moral, 
truly 
interpreted: 
“Love 
your 
enemies: 
do 
good 
to 
them 
that 
hate 
you; 
be 
like 
to 
your 
heavenly 
Father, 
that 
suffereth 
His 
rain 
to 
fall 
upon 
the 
just 
and 
unjust.” 
To 
this 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
applauded, 
Nec 
vox 
hominem 
sonat: 
it 
is 
a 
voice 
beyond 
the 
light 
of 
nature. 
So 
we 
see 
the 
heathen 
poets, 
when 
they 
fall 
upon 
a 
libertine 
passion, 
do 
still 
expostulate 
with 
laws 
and 
moralities, 
as 
if 
they 
were 
opposite 
and 
malignant 
to 
nature: 
Et 
quod 
natura 
remittit, 
invida 
jura 
negant. 
So 
said 
Dendamis 
the 
Indian 
unto 
Alexander’s 
messengers, 
that 
he 
had 
heard 
somewhat 
of 
Pythagoras, 
and 
some 
other 
of 
the 
wise 
men 
of 
Graecia, 
and 
that 
he 
held 
them 
for 
excellent 
men: 
but 
that 
they 
had 
a 
fault, 
which 
was 
that 
they 
had 
in 
too 
great 
reverence 
and 
veneration 
a 
thing 
they 

called 
law 
and 
manners. 
So 
it 
must 
be 
confessed 
that 
a 
great 
part 
of 
the 
law 
moral 
is 
of 
that 
perfection 
whereunto 
the 
light 
of 
nature 
cannot 
aspire: 
how 
then 
is 
it 
that 
man 
is 
said 
to 
have, 
by 
the 
light 
and 
law 
of 
nature, 
some 
notions 
and 
conceits 
of 
virtue 
and 
vice, 
justice 
and 
wrong, 
good 
and 
evil? 
Thus, 
because 
the 
light 
of 
nature 
is 
used 
in 
two 
several 
senses: 
the 
one, 
that 
which 
springeth 
from 
reason, 
sense, 
induction, 
argument, 
according 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
heaven 
and 
earth; 
the 
other, 
that 
which 
is 
imprinted 
upon 
the 
spirit 
of 
man 
by 
an 
inward 
instinct, 
according 
to 
the 
law 
of 
conscience, 
which 
is 
a 
sparkle 
of 
the 
purity 
of 
his 
first 
estate: 
in 
which 
latter 
sense 
only 
he 
is 
participant 
of 
some 
light 
and 
discerning 
touching 
the 
perfection 
of 
the 
moral 
law; 
but 
how? 
sufficient 
to 
check 
the 
vice 
but 
not 
to 
inform 
the 
duty. 
So 
then 
the 
doctrine 
of 
religion, 
as 
well 
moral 
as 
mystical, 
is 
not 
to 
be 
attained 
but 
by 
inspiration 
and 
revelation 
from 
God. 


(4) 
The 
use 
notwithstanding 
of 
reason 
in 
spiritual 
things, 
and 
the 
latitude 
thereof, 
is 
very 
great 
and 
general: 
for 
it 
is 
not 
for 
nothing 
that 
the 
apostle 
calleth 
religion 
“our 
reasonable 
service 
of 
God;” 
insomuch 
as 
the 
very 
ceremonies 
and 
figures 
of 
the 
old 
law 
were 
full 
of 
reason 
and 
signification, 
much 
more 
than 
the 
ceremonies 
of 
idolatry 
and 
magic, 
that 
are 
full 
of 
non-significants 
and 
surd 
characters. 
But 
most 
specially 
the 
Christian 
faith, 
as 
in 
all 
things 
so 
in 
this, 
deserveth 
to 
be 
highly 
magnified; 
holding 
and 
preserving 
the 
golden 
mediocrity 
in 
this 
point 
between 
the 
law 
of 
the 
heathen 
and 
the 
law 
of 
Mahomet, 
which 
have 
embraced 
the 
two 
extremes. 
For 
the 
religion 
of 
the 
heathen 
had 
no 
constant 
belief 
or 
confession, 
but 
left 
all 
to 
the 
liberty 
of 
agent; 
and 
the 
religion 
of 
Mahomet 
on 
the 
other 
side 
interdicteth 
argument 
altogether: 
the 
one 
having 
the 
very 
face 
of 
error, 
and 
the 
other 
of 
imposture; 
whereas 
the 
Faith 
doth 
both 
admit 
and 
reject 
disputation 
with 
difference. 
(5) 
The 
use 
of 
human 
reason 
in 
religion 
is 
of 
two 
sorts: 
the 
former, 
in 
the 
conception 
and 
apprehension 
of 
the 
mysteries 
of 
God 
to 
us 
revealed; 
the 
other, 
in 
the 
inferring 
and 
deriving 
of 
doctrine 
and 
direction 
thereupon. 
The 
former 
extendeth 
to 
the 
mysteries 
themselves; 
but 
how? 
by 
way 
of 
illustration, 
and 
not 
by 
way 
of 
argument. 
The 
latter 
consisteth 
indeed 
of 
probation 
and 
argument. 
In 
the 
former 
we 
see 
God 
vouchsafeth 
to 
descend 
to 
our 
capacity, 
in 
the 
expressing 
of 
His 
mysteries 
in 
sort 
as 
may 
be 
sensible 
unto 
us; 
and 
doth 
graft 
His 
revelations 
and 
holy 
doctrine 
upon 
the 
notions 
of 
our 
reason, 
and 
applieth 
His 
inspirations 
to 
open 
our 
understanding, 
as 
the 

form 
of 
the 
key 
to 
the 
ward 
of 
the 
lock. 
For 
the 
latter 
there 
is 
allowed 
us 
a 
use 
of 
reason 
and 
argument, 
secondary 
and 
respective, 
although 
not 
original 
and 
absolute. 
For 
after 
the 
articles 
and 
principles 
of 
religion 
are 
placed 
and 
exempted 
from 
examination 
of 
reason, 
it 
is 
then 
permitted 
unto 
us 
to 
make 
derivations 
and 
inferences 
from 
and 
according 
to 
the 
analogy 
of 
them, 
for 
our 
better 
direction. 
In 
nature 
this 
holdeth 
not; 
for 
both 
the 
principles 
are 
examinable 
by 
induction, 
though 
not 
by 
a 
medium 
or 
syllogism; 
and 
besides, 
those 
principles 
or 
first 
positions 
have 
no 
discordance 
with 
that 
reason 
which 
draweth 
down 
and 
deduceth 
the 
inferior 
positions. 
But 
yet 
it 
holdeth 
not 
in 
religion 
alone, 
but 
in 
many 
knowledges, 
both 
of 
greater 
and 
smaller 
nature, 
namely, 
wherein 
there 
are 
not 
only 
posita 
but 
placita; 
for 
in 
such 
there 
can 
be 
no 
use 
of 
absolute 
reason. 
We 
see 
it 
familiarly 
in 
games 
of 
wit, 
as 
chess, 
or 
the 
like. 
The 
draughts 
and 
first 
laws 
of 
the 
game 
are 
positive, 
but 
how? 
merely 
ad 
placitum, 
and 
not 
examinable 
by 
reason; 
but 
then 
how 
to 
direct 
our 
play 
thereupon 
with 
best 
advantage 
to 
win 
the 
game 
is 
artificial 
and 
rational. 
So 
in 
human 
laws 
there 
be 
many 
grounds 
and 
maxims 
which 
are 
placita 
juris, 
positive 
upon 
authority, 
and 
not 
upon 
reason, 
and 
therefore 
not 
to 
be 
disputed: 
but 
what 
is 
most 
just, 
not 
absolutely 
but 
relatively, 
and 
according 
to 
those 
maxims, 
that 
affordeth 
a 
long 
field 
of 
disputation. 
Such 
therefore 
is 
that 
secondary 
reason, 
which 
hath 
place 
in 
divinity, 
which 
is 
grounded 
upon 
the 
placets 
of 
God. 


(6) 
Here 
therefore 
I 
note 
this 
deficiency, 
that 
there 
hath 
not 
been, 
to 
my 
understanding, 
sufficiently 
inquired 
and 
handled 
the 
true 
limits 
and 
use 
of 
reason 
in 
spiritual 
things, 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
divine 
dialectic: 
which 
for 
that 
it 
is 
not 
done, 
it 
seemeth 
to 
me 
a 
thing 
usual, 
by 
pretext 
of 
true 
conceiving 
that 
which 
is 
revealed, 
to 
search 
and 
mine 
into 
that 
which 
is 
not 
revealed; 
and 
by 
pretext 
of 
enucleating 
inferences 
and 
contradictories, 
to 
examine 
that 
which 
is 
positive. 
The 
one 
sort 
falling 
into 
the 
error 
of 
Nicodemus, 
demanding 
to 
have 
things 
made 
more 
sensible 
than 
it 
pleaseth 
God 
to 
reveal 
them, 
Quomodo 
possit 
homo 
nasci 
cum 
sit 
senex? 
The 
other 
sort 
into 
the 
error 
of 
the 
disciples, 
which 
were 
scandalised 
at 
a 
show 
of 
contradiction, 
Quid 
est 
hoc 
quod 
dicit 
nobis? 
Modicum 
et 
non 
videbitis 
me; 
et 
iterum, 
modicum, 
et 
videbitis 
me, 
&c. 
(7) 
Upon 
this 
I 
have 
insisted 
the 
more, 
in 
regard 
of 
the 
great 
and 
blessed 
use 
thereof; 
for 
this 
point 
well 
laboured 
and 
defined 
of 
would 
in 
my 
judgment 
be 
an 
opiate 
to 
stay 
and 
bridle 
not 
only 
the 
vanity 
of 
curious 

speculations, 
wherewith 
the 
schools 
labour, 
but 
the 
fury 
of 
controversies, 
wherewith 
the 
Church 
laboureth. 
For 
it 
cannot 
but 
open 
men’s 
eyes 
to 
see 
that 
many 
controversies 
do 
merely 
pertain 
to 
that 
which 
is 
either 
not 
revealed 
or 
positive; 
and 
that 
many 
others 
do 
grow 
upon 
weak 
and 
obscure 
inferences 
or 
derivations: 
which 
latter 
sort, 
if 
men 
would 
revive 
the 
blessed 
style 
of 
that 
great 
doctor 
of 
the 
Gentiles, 
would 
be 
carried 
thus, 
ego, 
non 
dominus; 
and 
again, 
secundum 
consilium 
meum, 
in 
opinions 
and 
counsels, 
and 
not 
in 
positions 
and 
oppositions. 
But 
men 
are 
now 
over-ready 
to 
usurp 
the 
style, 
non 
ego, 
sed 
dominus; 
and 
not 
so 
only, 
but 
to 
bind 
it 
with 
the 
thunder 
and 
denunciation 
of 
curses 
and 
anathemas, 
to 
the 
terror 
of 
those 
which 
have 
not 
sufficiently 
learned 
out 
of 
Solomon 
that 
“The 
causeless 
curse 
shall 
not 
come.” 


(8) 
Divinity 
hath 
two 
principal 
parts: 
the 
matter 
informed 
or 
revealed, 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
information 
or 
revelation; 
and 
with 
the 
latter 
we 
will 
begin, 
because 
it 
hath 
most 
coherence 
with 
that 
which 
we 
have 
now 
last 
handled. 
The 
nature 
of 
the 
information 
consisteth 
of 
three 
branches: 
the 
limits 
of 
the 
information, 
the 
sufficiency 
of 
the 
information, 
and 
the 
acquiring 
or 
obtaining 
the 
information. 
Unto 
the 
limits 
of 
the 
information 
belong 
these 
considerations: 
how 
far 
forth 
particular 
persons 
continue 
to 
be 
inspired; 
how 
far 
forth 
the 
Church 
is 
inspired; 
and 
how 
far 
forth 
reason 
may 
be 
used; 
the 
last 
point 
whereof 
I 
have 
noted 
as 
deficient. 
Unto 
the 
sufficiency 
of 
the 
information 
belong 
two 
considerations: 
what 
points 
of 
religion 
are 
fundamental, 
and 
what 
perfective, 
being 
matter 
of 
further 
building 
and 
perfection 
upon 
one 
and 
the 
same 
foundation; 
and 
again, 
how 
the 
gradations 
of 
light 
according 
to 
the 
dispensation 
of 
times 
are 
material 
to 
the 
sufficiency 
of 
belief. 
(9) 
Here 
again 
I 
may 
rather 
give 
it 
in 
advice 
than 
note 
it 
as 
deficient, 
that 
the 
points 
fundamental, 
and 
the 
points 
of 
further 
perfection 
only, 
ought 
to 
be 
with 
piety 
and 
wisdom 
distinguished; 
a 
subject 
tending 
to 
much 
like 
end 
as 
that 
I 
noted 
before; 
for 
as 
that 
other 
were 
likely 
to 
abate 
the 
number 
of 
controversies, 
so 
this 
is 
likely 
to 
abate 
the 
heat 
of 
many 
of 
them. 
We 
see 
Moses 
when 
he 
saw 
the 
Israelite 
and 
the 
Egyptian 
fight, 
he 
did 
not 
say, 
“Why 
strive 
you?” 
but 
drew 
his 
sword 
and 
slew 
the 
Egyptian; 
but 
when 
he 
saw 
the 
two 
Israelites 
fight, 
he 
said, 
“You 
are 
brethren, 
why 
strive 
you?” 
If 
the 
point 
of 
doctrine 
be 
an 
Egyptian, 
it 
must 
be 
slain 
by 
the 
sword 
of 
the 
Spirit, 
and 
not 
reconciled; 
but 
if 
it 
be 
an 
Israelite, 
though 
in 
the 
wrong, 
then, 
“Why 
strive 

you?” 
We 
see 
of 
the 
fundamental 
points, 
our 
Saviour 
penneth 
the 
league 
thus, 
“He 
that 
is 
not 
with 
us 
is 
against 
us;” 
but 
of 
points 
not 
fundamental, 
thus, 
“He 
that 
is 
not 
against 
us 
is 
with 
us.” 
So 
we 
see 
the 
coat 
of 
our 
Saviour 
was 
entire 
without 
seam, 
and 
so 
is 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
Scriptures 
in 
itself; 
but 
the 
garment 
of 
the 
Church 
was 
of 
divers 
colours 
and 
yet 
not 
divided. 
We 
see 
the 
chaff 
may 
and 
ought 
to 
be 
severed 
from 
the 
corn 
in 
the 
ear, 
but 
the 
tares 
may 
not 
be 
pulled 
up 
from 
the 
corn 
in 
the 
field. 
So 
as 
it 
is 
a 
thing 
of 
great 
use 
well 
to 
define 
what, 
and 
of 
what 
latitude, 
those 
points 
are 
which 
do 
make 
men 
mere 
aliens 
and 
disincorporate 
from 
the 
Church 
of 
God. 


(10) 
For 
the 
obtaining 
of 
the 
information, 
it 
resteth 
upon 
the 
true 
and 
sound 
interpretation 
of 
the 
Scriptures, 
which 
are 
the 
fountains 
of 
the 
water 
of 
life. 
The 
interpretations 
of 
the 
Scriptures 
are 
of 
two 
sorts: 
methodical, 
and 
solute 
or 
at 
large. 
For 
this 
divine 
water, 
which 
excelleth 
so 
much 
that 
of 
Jacob’s 
well, 
is 
drawn 
forth 
much 
in 
the 
same 
kind 
as 
natural 
water 
useth 
to 
be 
out 
of 
wells 
and 
fountains; 
either 
it 
is 
first 
forced 
up 
into 
a 
cistern, 
and 
from 
thence 
fetched 
and 
derived 
for 
use; 
or 
else 
it 
is 
drawn 
and 
received 
in 
buckets 
and 
vessels 
immediately 
where 
it 
springeth. 
The 
former 
sort 
whereof, 
though 
it 
seem 
to 
be 
the 
more 
ready, 
yet 
in 
my 
judgment 
is 
more 
subject 
to 
corrupt. 
This 
is 
that 
method 
which 
hath 
exhibited 
unto 
us 
the 
scholastical 
divinity; 
whereby 
divinity 
hath 
been 
reduced 
into 
an 
art, 
as 
into 
a 
cistern, 
and 
the 
streams 
of 
doctrine 
or 
positions 
fetched 
and 
derived 
from 
thence. 
(11) 
In 
this 
men 
have 
sought 
three 
things, 
a 
summary 
brevity, 
a 
compacted 
strength, 
and 
a 
complete 
perfection; 
whereof 
the 
two 
first 
they 
fail 
to 
find, 
and 
the 
last 
they 
ought 
not 
to 
seek. 
For 
as 
to 
brevity, 
we 
see 
in 
all 
summary 
methods, 
while 
men 
purpose 
to 
abridge, 
they 
give 
cause 
to 
dilate. 
For 
the 
sum 
or 
abridgment 
by 
contraction 
becometh 
obscure; 
the 
obscurity 
requireth 
exposition, 
and 
the 
exposition 
is 
deduced 
into 
large 
commentaries, 
or 
into 
commonplaces 
and 
titles, 
which 
grow 
to 
be 
more 
vast 
than 
the 
original 
writings, 
whence 
the 
sum 
was 
at 
first 
extracted. 
So 
we 
see 
the 
volumes 
of 
the 
schoolmen 
are 
greater 
much 
than 
the 
first 
writings 
of 
the 
fathers, 
whence 
the 
master 
of 
the 
sentences 
made 
his 
sum 
or 
collection. 
So 
in 
like 
manner 
the 
volumes 
of 
the 
modern 
doctors 
of 
the 
civil 
law 
exceed 
those 
of 
the 
ancient 
jurisconsults, 
of 
which 
Tribonian 
compiled 
the 
digest. 
So 
as 
this 
course 
of 
sums 
and 
commentaries 
is 
that 
which 
doth 
infallibly 
make 
the 
body 
of 
sciences 
more 
immense 
in 
quantity, 
and 
more 
base 
in 
substance. 
(12) 
And 
for 
strength, 
it 
is 
true 
that 
knowledges 
reduced 
into 
exact 

methods 
have 
a 
show 
of 
strength, 
in 
that 
each 
part 
seemeth 
to 
support 
and 
sustain 
the 
other; 
but 
this 
is 
more 
satisfactory 
than 
substantial, 
like 
unto 
buildings 
which 
stand 
by 
architecture 
and 
compaction, 
which 
are 
more 
subject 
to 
ruin 
than 
those 
that 
are 
built 
more 
strong 
in 
their 
several 
parts, 
though 
less 
compacted. 
But 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
the 
more 
you 
recede 
from 
your 
grounds, 
the 
weaker 
do 
you 
conclude; 
and 
as 
in 
nature, 
the 
more 
you 
remove 
yourself 
from 
particulars, 
the 
greater 
peril 
of 
error 
you 
do 
incur; 
so 
much 
more 
in 
divinity, 
the 
more 
you 
recede 
from 
the 
Scriptures 
by 
inferences 
and 
consequences, 
the 
more 
weak 
and 
dilute 
are 
your 
positions. 


(13) 
And 
as 
for 
perfection 
or 
completeness 
in 
divinity, 
it 
is 
not 
to 
be 
sought, 
which 
makes 
this 
course 
of 
artificial 
divinity 
the 
more 
suspect. 
For 
he 
that 
will 
reduce 
a 
knowledge 
into 
an 
art 
will 
make 
it 
round 
and 
uniform; 
but 
in 
divinity 
many 
things 
must 
be 
left 
abrupt, 
and 
concluded 
with 
this: 
O 
altitudo 
sapientiae 
et 
scientiae 
Dei! 
quam 
incomprehensibilia 
sunt 
juducua 
ejus, 
et 
non 
investigabiles 
viae 
ejus. 
So 
again 
the 
apostle 
saith, 
Ex 
parte 
scimus: 
and 
to 
have 
the 
form 
of 
a 
total, 
where 
there 
is 
but 
matter 
for 
a 
part, 
cannot 
be 
without 
supplies 
by 
supposition 
and 
presumption. 
And 
therefore 
I 
conclude 
that 
the 
true 
use 
of 
these 
sums 
and 
methods 
hath 
place 
in 
institutions 
or 
introductions 
preparatory 
unto 
knowledge; 
but 
in 
them, 
or 
by 
deducement 
from 
them, 
to 
handle 
the 
main 
body 
and 
substance 
of 
a 
knowledge 
is 
in 
all 
sciences 
prejudicial, 
and 
in 
divinity 
dangerous. 
(14) 
As 
to 
the 
interpretation 
of 
the 
Scriptures 
solute 
and 
at 
large, 
there 
have 
been 
divers 
kinds 
introduced 
and 
devised; 
some 
of 
them 
rather 
curious 
and 
unsafe 
than 
sober 
and 
warranted. 
Notwithstanding, 
thus 
much 
must 
be 
confessed, 
that 
the 
Scriptures, 
being 
given 
by 
inspiration 
and 
not 
by 
human 
reason, 
do 
differ 
from 
all 
other 
books 
in 
the 
Author, 
which 
by 
consequence 
doth 
draw 
on 
some 
difference 
to 
be 
used 
by 
the 
expositor. 
For 
the 
Inditer 
of 
them 
did 
know 
four 
things 
which 
no 
man 
attains 
to 
know; 
which 
are 
— 
the 
mysteries 
of 
the 
kingdom 
of 
glory, 
the 
perfection 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
nature, 
the 
secrets 
of 
the 
heart 
of 
man, 
and 
the 
future 
succession 
of 
all 
ages. 
For 
as 
to 
the 
first 
it 
is 
said, 
“He 
that 
presseth 
into 
the 
light 
shall 
be 
oppressed 
of 
the 
glory.” 
And 
again, 
“No 
man 
shall 
see 
My 
face 
and 
live.” 
To 
the 
second, 
“When 
He 
prepared 
the 
heavens 
I 
was 
present, 
when 
by 
law 
and 
compass 
He 
enclosed 
the 
deep.” 
To 
the 
third, 
“Neither 
was 
it 
needful 
that 
any 
should 
bear 
witness 
to 
Him 
of 
man, 
for 
He 
knew 
well 
what 
was 
in 
man.” 
And 
to 
the 
last, 
“From 
the 
beginning 
are 
known 
to 
the 
Lord 
all 
His 
works.” 

(15) 
From 
the 
former 
two 
of 
these 
have 
been 
drawn 
certain 
senses 
and 
expositions 
of 
Scriptures, 
which 
had 
need 
be 
contained 
within 
the 
bounds 
of 
sobriety 
— 
the 
one 
anagogical, 
and 
the 
other 
philosophical. 
But 
as 
to 
the 
former, 
man 
is 
not 
to 
prevent 
his 
time: 
Videmus 
nunc 
per 
speculum 
in 
aenigmate, 
tunc 
autem 
facie 
ad 
faciem; 
wherein 
nevertheless 
there 
seemeth 
to 
be 
a 
liberty 
granted, 
as 
far 
forth 
as 
the 
polishing 
of 
this 
glass, 
or 
some 
moderate 
explication 
of 
this 
enigma. 
But 
to 
press 
too 
far 
into 
it 
cannot 
but 
cause 
a 
dissolution 
and 
overthrow 
of 
the 
spirit 
of 
man. 
For 
in 
the 
body 
there 
are 
three 
degrees 
of 
that 
we 
receive 
into 
it 
— 
aliment, 
medicine, 
and 
poison; 
whereof 
aliment 
is 
that 
which 
the 
nature 
of 
man 
can 
perfectly 
alter 
and 
overcome; 
medicine 
is 
that 
which 
is 
partly 
converted 
by 
nature, 
and 
partly 
converteth 
nature; 
and 
poison 
is 
that 
which 
worketh 
wholly 
upon 
nature, 
without 
that 
nature 
can 
in 
any 
part 
work 
upon 
it. 
So 
in 
the 
mind, 
whatsoever 
knowledge 
reason 
cannot 
at 
all 
work 
upon 
and 
convert 
is 
a 
mere 
intoxication, 
and 
endangereth 
a 
dissolution 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
understanding. 
(16) 
But 
for 
the 
latter, 
it 
hath 
been 
extremely 
set 
on 
foot 
of 
late 
time 
by 
the 
school 
of 
Paracelsus, 
and 
some 
others, 
that 
have 
pretended 
to 
find 
the 
truth 
of 
all 
natural 
philosophy 
in 
the 
Scriptures; 
scandalising 
and 
traducing 
all 
other 
philosophy 
as 
heathenish 
and 
profane. 
But 
there 
is 
no 
such 
enmity 
between 
God’s 
Word 
and 
His 
works; 
neither 
do 
they 
give 
honour 
to 
the 
Scriptures, 
as 
they 
suppose, 
but 
much 
embase 
them. 
For 
to 
seek 
heaven 
and 
earth 
in 
the 
Word 
of 
God, 
whereof 
it 
is 
said, 
“Heaven 
and 
earth 
shall 
pass, 
but 
My 
word 
shall 
not 
pass,” 
is 
to 
seek 
temporary 
things 
amongst 
eternal: 
and 
as 
to 
seek 
divinity 
in 
philosophy 
is 
to 
seek 
the 
living 
amongst 
the 
dead, 
so 
to 
seek 
philosophy 
in 
divinity 
is 
to 
seek 
the 
dead 
amongst 
the 
living: 
neither 
are 
the 
pots 
or 
lavers, 
whose 
place 
was 
in 
the 
outward 
part 
of 
the 
temple, 
to 
be 
sought 
in 
the 
holiest 
place 
of 
all 
where 
the 
ark 
of 
the 
testimony 
was 
seated. 
And 
again, 
the 
scope 
or 
purpose 
of 
the 
Spirit 
of 
God 
is 
not 
to 
express 
matters 
of 
nature 
in 
the 
Scriptures, 
otherwise 
than 
in 
passage, 
and 
for 
application 
to 
man’s 
capacity 
and 
to 
matters 
moral 
or 
divine. 
And 
it 
is 
a 
true 
rule, 
Auctoris 
aliud 
agentis 
parva 
auctoritas. 
For 
it 
were 
a 
strange 
conclusion, 
if 
a 
man 
should 
use 
a 
similitude 
for 
ornament 
or 
illustration 
sake, 
borrowed 
from 
nature 
or 
history 
according 
to 
vulgar 
conceit, 
as 
of 
a 
basilisk, 
a 
unicorn, 
a 
centaur, 
a 
Briareus, 
a 
hydra, 
or 
the 
like, 
that 
therefore 
he 
must 
needs 
be 
thought 
to 
affirm 
the 
matter 
thereof 
positively 
to 
be 
true. 
To 
conclude 
therefore 
these 
two 
interpretations, 
the 
one 
by 
reduction 
or 
enigmatical, 
the 
other 
philosophical 
or 
physical, 
which 
have 
been 
received 
and 
pursued 
in 

imitation 
of 
the 
rabbins 
and 
cabalists, 
are 
to 
be 
confined 
with 
a 
a 
noli 
akryn 
sapere, 
sed 
time. 


(17) 
But 
the 
two 
latter 
points, 
known 
to 
God 
and 
unknown 
to 
man, 
touching 
the 
secrets 
of 
the 
heart 
and 
the 
successions 
of 
time, 
doth 
make 
a 
just 
and 
sound 
difference 
between 
the 
manner 
of 
the 
exposition 
of 
the 
Scriptures 
and 
all 
other 
books. 
For 
it 
is 
an 
excellent 
observation 
which 
hath 
been 
made 
upon 
the 
answers 
of 
our 
Saviour 
Christ 
to 
many 
of 
the 
questions 
which 
were 
propounded 
to 
Him, 
how 
that 
they 
are 
impertinent 
to 
the 
state 
of 
the 
question 
demanded: 
the 
reason 
whereof 
is, 
because 
not 
being 
like 
man, 
which 
knows 
man’s 
thoughts 
by 
his 
words, 
but 
knowing 
man’s 
thoughts 
immediately, 
He 
never 
answered 
their 
words, 
but 
their 
thoughts. 
Much 
in 
the 
like 
manner 
it 
is 
with 
the 
Scriptures, 
which 
being 
written 
to 
the 
thoughts 
of 
men, 
and 
to 
the 
succession 
of 
all 
ages, 
with 
a 
foresight 
of 
all 
heresies, 
contradictions, 
differing 
estates 
of 
the 
Church, 
yea, 
and 
particularly 
of 
the 
elect, 
are 
not 
to 
be 
interpreted 
only 
according 
to 
the 
latitude 
of 
the 
proper 
sense 
of 
the 
place, 
and 
respectively 
towards 
that 
present 
occasion 
whereupon 
the 
words 
were 
uttered, 
or 
in 
precise 
congruity 
or 
contexture 
with 
the 
words 
before 
or 
after, 
or 
in 
contemplation 
of 
the 
principal 
scope 
of 
the 
place; 
but 
have 
in 
themselves, 
not 
only 
totally 
or 
collectively, 
but 
distributively 
in 
clauses 
and 
words, 
infinite 
springs 
and 
streams 
of 
doctrine 
to 
water 
the 
Church 
in 
every 
part. 
And 
therefore 
as 
the 
literal 
sense 
is, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 
main 
stream 
or 
river, 
so 
the 
moral 
sense 
chiefly, 
and 
sometimes 
the 
allegorical 
or 
typical, 
are 
they 
whereof 
the 
Church 
hath 
most 
use; 
not 
that 
I 
wish 
men 
to 
be 
bold 
in 
allegories, 
or 
indulgent 
or 
light 
in 
allusions: 
but 
that 
I 
do 
much 
condemn 
that 
interpretation 
of 
the 
Scripture 
which 
is 
only 
after 
the 
manner 
as 
men 
use 
to 
interpret 
a 
profane 
book. 
(18) 
In 
this 
part 
touching 
the 
exposition 
of 
the 
Scriptures, 
I 
can 
report 
no 
deficiency; 
but 
by 
way 
of 
remembrance 
this 
I 
will 
add. 
In 
perusing 
books 
of 
divinity 
I 
find 
many 
books 
of 
controversies, 
and 
many 
of 
commonplaces 
and 
treatises, 
a 
mass 
of 
positive 
divinity, 
as 
it 
is 
made 
an 
art: 
a 
number 
of 
sermons 
and 
lectures, 
and 
many 
prolix 
commentaries 
upon 
the 
Scriptures, 
with 
harmonies 
and 
concordances. 
But 
that 
form 
of 
writing 
in 
divinity 
which 
in 
my 
judgment 
is 
of 
all 
others 
most 
rich 
and 
precious 
is 
positive 
divinity, 
collected 
upon 
particular 
texts 
of 
Scriptures 
in 
brief 
observations; 
not 
dilated 
into 
commonplaces, 
not 
chasing 
after 
controversies, 
not 
reduced 
into 
method 
of 
art; 
a 
thing 
abounding 
in 
sermons, 
which 
will 

vanish, 
but 
defective 
in 
books 
which 
will 
remain, 
and 
a 
thing 
wherein 
this 
age 
excelleth. 
For 
I 
am 
persuaded, 
and 
I 
may 
speak 
it 
with 
an 
absit 
invidia 
verbo, 
and 
nowise 
in 
derogation 
of 
antiquity, 
but 
as 
in 
a 
good 
emulation 
between 
the 
vine 
and 
the 
olive, 
that 
if 
the 
choice 
and 
best 
of 
those 
observations 
upon 
texts 
of 
Scriptures 
which 
have 
been 
made 
dispersedly 
in 
sermons 
within 
this 
your 
Majesty’s 
Island 
of 
Brittany 
by 
the 
space 
of 
these 
forty 
years 
and 
more 
(leaving 
out 
the 
largeness 
of 
exhortations 
and 
applications 
thereupon) 
had 
been 
set 
down 
in 
a 
continuance, 
it 
had 
been 
the 
best 
work 
in 
divinity 
which 
had 
been 
written 
since 
the 
Apostles’ 
times. 


(19) 
The 
matter 
informed 
by 
divinity 
is 
of 
two 
kinds: 
matter 
of 
belief 
and 
truth 
of 
opinion, 
and 
matter 
of 
service 
and 
adoration; 
which 
is 
also 
judged 
and 
directed 
by 
the 
former 
— 
the 
one 
being 
as 
the 
internal 
soul 
of 
religion, 
and 
the 
other 
as 
the 
external 
body 
thereof. 
And, 
therefore, 
the 
heathen 
religion 
was 
not 
only 
a 
worship 
of 
idols, 
but 
the 
whole 
religion 
was 
an 
idol 
in 
itself; 
for 
it 
had 
no 
soul; 
that 
is, 
no 
certainty 
of 
belief 
or 
confession: 
as 
a 
man 
may 
well 
think, 
considering 
the 
chief 
doctors 
of 
their 
church 
were 
the 
poets; 
and 
the 
reason 
was 
because 
the 
heathen 
gods 
were 
no 
jealous 
gods, 
but 
were 
glad 
to 
be 
admitted 
into 
part, 
as 
they 
had 
reason. 
Neither 
did 
they 
respect 
the 
pureness 
of 
heart, 
so 
they 
might 
have 
external 
honour 
and 
rites. 
(20) 
But 
out 
of 
these 
two 
do 
result 
and 
issue 
four 
main 
branches 
of 
divinity: 
faith, 
manners, 
liturgy, 
and 
government. 
Faith 
containeth 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
God, 
of 
the 
attributes 
of 
God, 
and 
of 
the 
works 
of 
God. 
The 
nature 
of 
God 
consisteth 
of 
three 
persons 
in 
unity 
of 
Godhead. 
The 
attributes 
of 
God 
are 
either 
common 
to 
the 
Deity, 
or 
respective 
to 
the 
persons. 
The 
works 
of 
God 
summary 
are 
two, 
that 
of 
the 
creation 
and 
that 
of 
the 
redemption; 
and 
both 
these 
works, 
as 
in 
total 
they 
appertain 
to 
the 
unity 
of 
the 
Godhead, 
so 
in 
their 
parts 
they 
refer 
to 
the 
three 
persons: 
that 
of 
the 
creation, 
in 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
matter, 
to 
the 
Father; 
in 
the 
disposition 
of 
the 
form, 
to 
the 
Son; 
and 
in 
the 
continuance 
and 
conservation 
of 
the 
being, 
to 
the 
Holy 
Spirit. 
So 
that 
of 
the 
redemption, 
in 
the 
election 
and 
counsel, 
to 
the 
Father; 
in 
the 
whole 
act 
and 
consummation, 
to 
the 
Son; 
and 
in 
the 
application, 
to 
the 
Holy 
Spirit; 
for 
by 
the 
Holy 
Ghost 
was 
Christ 
conceived 
in 
flesh, 
and 
by 
the 
Holy 
Ghost 
are 
the 
elect 
regenerate 
in 
spirit. 
This 
work 
likewise 
we 
consider 
either 
effectually, 
in 
the 
elect; 
or 
privately, 
in 
the 
reprobate; 
or 
according 
to 
appearance, 
in 
the 
visible 
Church. 
(21) 
For 
manners, 
the 
doctrine 
thereof 
is 
contained 
in 
the 
law, 
which 

discloseth 
sin. 
The 
law 
itself 
is 
divided, 
according 
to 
the 
edition 
thereof, 
into 
the 
law 
of 
nature, 
the 
law 
moral, 
and 
the 
law 
positive; 
and 
according 
to 
the 
style, 
into 
negative 
and 
affirmative, 
prohibitions 
and 
commandments. 
Sin, 
in 
the 
matter 
and 
subject 
thereof, 
is 
divided 
according 
to 
the 
commandments; 
in 
the 
form 
thereof 
it 
referreth 
to 
the 
three 
persons 
in 
Deity: 
sins 
of 
infirmity 
against 
the 
Father, 
whose 
more 
special 
attribute 
is 
power; 
sins 
of 
ignorance 
against 
the 
Son, 
whose 
attribute 
is 
wisdom; 
and 
sins 
of 
malice 
against 
the 
Holy 
Ghost, 
whose 
attribute 
is 
grace 
or 
love. 
In 
the 
motions 
of 
it, 
it 
either 
moveth 
to 
the 
right 
hand 
or 
to 
the 
left; 
either 
to 
blind 
devotion 
or 
to 
profane 
and 
libertine 
transgression; 
either 
in 
imposing 
restraint 
where 
God 
granteth 
liberty, 
or 
in 
taking 
liberty 
where 
God 
imposeth 
restraint. 
In 
the 
degrees 
and 
progress 
of 
it, 
it 
divideth 
itself 
into 
thought, 
word, 
or 
act. 
And 
in 
this 
part 
I 
commend 
much 
the 
deducing 
of 
the 
law 
of 
God 
to 
cases 
of 
conscience; 
for 
that 
I 
take 
indeed 
to 
be 
a 
breaking, 
and 
not 
exhibiting 
whole 
of 
the 
bread 
of 
life. 
But 
that 
which 
quickeneth 
both 
these 
doctrines 
of 
faith 
and 
manners 
is 
the 
elevation 
and 
consent 
of 
the 
heart; 
whereunto 
appertain 
books 
of 
exhortation, 
holy 
meditation, 
Christian 
resolution, 
and 
the 
like. 


(22) 
For 
the 
liturgy 
or 
service, 
it 
consisteth 
of 
the 
reciprocal 
acts 
between 
God 
and 
man; 
which, 
on 
the 
part 
of 
God, 
are 
the 
preaching 
of 
the 
word, 
and 
the 
sacraments, 
which 
are 
seals 
to 
the 
covenant, 
or 
as 
the 
visible 
word; 
and 
on 
the 
part 
of 
man, 
invocation 
of 
the 
name 
of 
God; 
and 
under 
the 
law, 
sacrifices; 
which 
were 
as 
visible 
prayers 
or 
confessions: 
but 
now 
the 
adoration 
being 
in 
spiritu 
et 
veritate, 
there 
remaineth 
only 
vituli 
labiorum; 
although 
the 
use 
of 
holy 
vows 
of 
thankfulness 
and 
retribution 
may 
be 
accounted 
also 
as 
sealed 
petitions. 
(23) 
And 
for 
the 
government 
of 
the 
Church, 
it 
consisteth 
of 
the 
patrimony 
of 
the 
Church, 
the 
franchises 
of 
the 
Church, 
and 
the 
offices 
and 
jurisdictions 
of 
the 
Church, 
and 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
Church 
directing 
the 
whole; 
all 
which 
have 
two 
considerations, 
the 
one 
in 
themselves, 
the 
other 
how 
they 
stand 
compatible 
and 
agreeable 
to 
the 
civil 
estate. 
(24) 
This 
matter 
of 
divinity 
is 
handled 
either 
in 
form 
of 
instruction 
of 
truth, 
or 
in 
form 
of 
confutation 
of 
falsehood. 
The 
declinations 
from 
religion, 
besides 
the 
privative, 
which 
is 
atheism 
and 
the 
branches 
thereof, 
are 
three 
— 
heresies, 
idolatry, 
and 
witchcraft: 
heresies, 
when 
we 
serve 
the 
true 
God 
with 
a 
false 
worship; 
idolatry, 
when 
we 
worship 
false 
gods, 
supposing 
them 
to 
be 
true; 
and 
witchcraft, 
when 
we 
adore 
false 
gods, 
knowing 
them 
to 

be 
wicked 
and 
false. 
For 
so 
your 
Majesty 
doth 
excellently 
well 
observe, 
that 
witchcraft 
is 
the 
height 
of 
idolatry. 
And 
yet 
we 
see 
though 
these 
be 
true 
degrees, 
Samuel 
teacheth 
us 
that 
they 
are 
all 
of 
a 
nature, 
when 
there 
is 
once 
a 
receding 
from 
the 
Word 
of 
God; 
for 
so 
he 
saith, 
Quasi 
peccatum 
ariolandi 
est 
repugnare, 
et 
quasi 
scelus 
idololatriae 
nolle 
acquiescere. 


(25) 
These 
things 
I 
have 
passed 
over 
so 
briefly 
because 
I 
can 
report 
no 
deficiency 
concerning 
them: 
for 
I 
can 
find 
no 
space 
or 
ground 
that 
lieth 
vacant 
and 
unsown 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
divinity, 
so 
diligent 
have 
men 
been 
either 
in 
sowing 
of 
good 
seed, 
or 
in 
sowing 
of 
tares. 
Thus 
have 
I 
made 
as 
it 
were 
a 
small 
globe 
of 
the 
intellectual 
world, 
as 
truly 
and 
faithfully 
as 
I 
could 
discover; 
with 
a 
note 
and 
description 
of 
those 
parts 
which 
seem 
to 
me 
not 
constantly 
occupate, 
or 
not 
well 
converted 
by 
the 
labour 
of 
man. 
In 
which, 
if 
I 
have 
in 
any 
point 
receded 
from 
that 
which 
is 
commonly 
received, 
it 
hath 
been 
with 
a 
purpose 
of 
proceeding 
in 
melius, 
and 
not 
in 
aliud; 
a 
mind 
of 
amendment 
and 
proficiency, 
and 
not 
of 
change 
and 
difference. 
For 
I 
could 
not 
be 
true 
and 
constant 
to 
the 
argument 
I 
handle 
if 
I 
were 
not 
willing 
to 
go 
beyond 
others; 
but 
yet 
not 
more 
willing 
than 
to 
have 
others 
go 
beyond 
me 
again: 
which 
may 
the 
better 
appear 
by 
this, 
that 
I 
have 
propounded 
my 
opinions 
naked 
and 
unarmed, 
not 
seeking 
to 
preoccupate 
the 
liberty 
of 
men’s 
judgments 
by 
confutations. 
For 
in 
anything 
which 
is 
well 
set 
down, 
I 
am 
in 
good 
hope 
that 
if 
the 
first 
reading 
move 
an 
objection, 
the 
second 
reading 
will 
make 
an 
answer. 
And 
in 
those 
things 
wherein 
I 
have 
erred, 
I 
am 
sure 
I 
have 
not 
prejudiced 
the 
right 
by 
litigious 
arguments; 
which 
certainly 
have 
this 
contrary 
effect 
and 
operation, 
that 
they 
add 
authority 
to 
error, 
and 
destroy 
the 
authority 
of 
that 
which 
is 
well 
invented. 
For 
question 
is 
an 
honour 
and 
preferment 
to 
falsehood, 
as 
on 
the 
other 
side 
it 
is 
a 
repulse 
to 
truth. 
But 
the 
errors 
I 
claim 
and 
challenge 
to 
myself 
as 
mine 
own. 
The 
good, 
it 
any 
be, 
is 
due 
tanquam 
adeps 
sacrificii, 
to 
be 
incensed 
to 
the 
honour, 
first 
of 
the 
Divine 
Majesty, 
and 
next 
of 
your 
Majesty, 
to 
whom 
on 
earth 
I 
am 
most 
bounden.

Author's 
Preface 


Those 
who 
have 
taken 
upon 
them 
to 
lay 
down 
the 
law 
of 
nature 
as 
a 
thing 
already 
searched 
out 
and 
understood, 
whether 
they 
have 
spoken 
in 
simple 
assurance 
or 
professional 
affectation, 
have 
therein 
done 
philosophy 
and 
the 
sciences 
great 
injury. 
For 
as 
they 
have 
been 
successful 
in 
inducing 
belief, 
so 
they 
have 
been 
effective 
in 
quenching 
and 
stopping 
inquiry; 
and 
have 
done 
more 
harm 
by 
spoiling 
and 
putting 
an 
end 
to 
other 
men's 
efforts 
than 
good 
by 
their 
own. 
Those 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
who 
have 
taken 
a 
contrary 
course, 
and 
asserted 
that 
absolutely 
nothing 
can 
be 
known 
— 
whether 
it 
were 
from 
hatred 
of 
the 
ancient 
sophists, 
or 
from 
uncertainty 
and 
fluctuation 
of 
mind, 
or 
even 
from 
a 
kind 
of 
fullness 
of 
learning, 
that 
they 
fell 
upon 
this 
opinion 
— 
have 
certainly 
advanced 
reasons 
for 
it 
that 
are 
not 
to 
be 
despised; 
but 
yet 
they 
have 
neither 
started 
from 
true 
principles 
nor 
rested 
in 
the 
just 
conclusion, 
zeal 
and 
affectation 
having 
carried 
them 
much 
too 
far. 
The 
more 
ancient 
of 
the 
Greeks 
(whose 
writings 
are 
lost) 
took 
up 
with 
better 
judgment 
a 
position 
between 
these 
two 
extremes 
— 
between 
the 
presumption 
of 
pronouncing 
on 
everything, 
and 
the 
despair 
of 
comprehending 
anything; 
and 
though 
frequently 
and 
bitterly 
complaining 
of 
the 
difficulty 
of 
inquiry 
and 
the 
obscurity 
of 
things, 
and 
like 
impatient 
horses 
champing 
at 
the 
bit, 
they 
did 
not 
the 
less 
follow 
up 
their 
object 
and 
engage 
with 
nature, 
thinking 
(it 
seems) 
that 
this 
very 
question 
— 
viz., 
whether 
or 
not 
anything 
can 
be 
known 
— 
was 
to 
be 
settled 
not 
by 
arguing, 
but 
by 
trying. 
And 
yet 
they 
too, 
trusting 
entirely 
to 
the 
force 
of 
their 
understanding, 
applied 
no 
rule, 
but 
made 
everything 
turn 
upon 
hard 
thinking 
and 
perpetual 
working 
and 
exercise 
of 
the 
mind. 


Now 
my 
method, 
though 
hard 
to 
practice, 
is 
easy 
to 
explain; 
and 
it 
is 
this. 
I 
propose 
to 
establish 
progressive 
stages 
of 
certainty. 
The 
evidence 
of 
the 
sense, 
helped 
and 
guarded 
by 
a 
certain 
process 
of 
correction, 
I 
retain. 
But 
the 
mental 
operation 
which 
follows 
the 
act 
of 
sense 
I 
for 
the 
most 
part 
reject; 
and 
instead 
of 
it 
I 
open 
and 
lay 
out 
a 
new 
and 
certain 
path 
for 
the 
mind 
to 
proceed 
in, 
starting 
directly 
from 
the 
simple 
sensuous 
perception. 
The 
necessity 
of 
this 
was 
felt, 
no 
doubt, 
by 
those 
who 
attributed 
so 
much 
importance 
to 
logic, 
showing 
thereby 
that 
they 
were 
in 
search 
of 
helps 
for 
the 
understanding, 
and 
had 
no 
confidence 
in 
the 
native 
and 
spontaneous 
process 
of 
the 
mind. 
But 
this 
remedy 
comes 
too 
late 
to 
do 
any 
good, 
when 
the 
mind 
is 



already, 
through 
the 
daily 
intercourse 
and 
conversation 
of 
life, 
occupied 
with 
unsound 
doctrines 
and 
beset 
on 
all 
sides 
by 
vain 
imaginations. 
And 
therefore 
that 
art 
of 
logic, 
coming 
(as 
I 
said) 
too 
late 
to 
the 
rescue, 
and 
no 
way 
able 
to 
set 
matters 
right 
again, 
has 
had 
the 
effect 
of 
fixing 
errors 
rather 
than 
disclosing 
truth. 
There 
remains 
but 
one 
course 
for 
the 
recovery 
of 
a 
sound 
and 
healthy 
condition 
— 
namely, 
that 
the 
entire 
work 
of 
the 
understanding 
be 
commenced 
afresh, 
and 
the 
mind 
itself 
be 
from 
the 
very 
outset 
not 
left 
to 
take 
its 
own 
course, 
but 
guided 
at 
every 
step; 
and 
the 
business 
be 
done 
as 
if 
by 
machinery. 
Certainly 
if 
in 
things 
mechanical 
men 
had 
set 
to 
work 
with 
their 
naked 
hands, 
without 
help 
or 
force 
of 
instruments, 
just 
as 
in 
things 
intellectual 
they 
have 
set 
to 
work 
with 
little 
else 
than 
the 
naked 
forces 
of 
the 
understanding, 
very 
small 
would 
the 
matters 
have 
been 
which, 
even 
with 
their 
best 
efforts 
applied 
in 
conjunction, 
they 
could 
have 
attempted 
or 
accomplished. 
Now 
(to 
pause 
a 
while 
upon 
this 
example 
and 
look 
in 
it 
as 
in 
a 
glass) 
let 
us 
suppose 
that 
some 
vast 
obelisk 
were 
(for 
the 
decoration 
of 
a 
triumph 
or 
some 
such 
magnificence) 
to 
be 
removed 
from 
its 
place, 
and 
that 
men 
should 
set 
to 
work 
upon 
it 
with 
their 
naked 
hands, 
would 
not 
any 
sober 
spectator 
think 
them 
mad? 
And 
if 
they 
should 
then 
send 
for 
more 
people, 
thinking 
that 
in 
that 
way 
they 
might 
manage 
it, 
would 
he 
not 
think 
them 
all 
the 
madder? 
And 
if 
they 
then 
proceeded 
to 
make 
a 
selection, 
putting 
away 
the 
weaker 
hands, 
and 
using 
only 
the 
strong 
and 
vigorous, 
would 
he 
not 
think 
them 
madder 
than 
ever? 
And 
if 
lastly, 
not 
content 
with 
this, 
they 
resolved 
to 
call 
in 
aid 
the 
art 
of 
athletics, 
and 
required 
all 
their 
men 
to 
come 
with 
hands, 
arms, 
and 
sinews 
well 
anointed 
and 
medicated 
according 
to 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
art, 
would 
he 
not 
cry 
out 
that 
they 
were 
only 
taking 
pains 
to 
show 
a 
kind 
of 
method 
and 
discretion 
in 
their 
madness? 
Yet 
just 
so 
it 
is 
that 
men 
proceed 
in 
matters 
intellectual 
— 
with 
just 
the 
same 
kind 
of 
mad 
effort 
and 
useless 
combination 
of 
forces 
— 
when 
they 
hope 
great 
things 
either 
from 
the 
number 
and 
cooperation 
or 
from 
the 
excellency 
and 
acuteness 
of 
individual 
wits; 
yea, 
and 
when 
they 
endeavor 
by 
logic 
(which 
may 
be 
considered 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
athletic 
art) 
to 
strengthen 
the 
sinews 
of 
the 
understanding, 
and 
yet 
with 
all 
this 
study 
and 
endeavor 
it 
is 
apparent 
to 
any 
true 
judgment 
that 
they 
are 
but 
applying 
the 
naked 
intellect 
all 
the 
time; 
whereas 
in 
every 
great 
work 
to 
be 
done 
by 
the 
hand 
of 
man 
it 
is 
manifestly 
impossible, 
without 
instruments 
and 
machinery, 
either 
for 
the 
strength 
of 
each 
to 
be 
exerted 
or 
the 
strength 
of 
all 
to 
be 
united. 


Upon 
these 
premises 
two 
things 
occur 
to 
me 
of 
which, 
that 
they 
may 



not 
be 
overlooked, 
I 
would 
have 
men 
reminded. 
First, 
it 
falls 
out 
fortunately 
as 
I 
think 
for 
the 
allaying 
of 
contradictions 
and 
heartburnings, 
that 
the 
honor 
and 
reverence 
due 
to 
the 
ancients 
remains 
untouched 
and 
undiminished, 
while 
I 
may 
carry 
out 
my 
designs 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
reap 
the 
fruit 
of 
my 
modesty. 
For 
if 
I 
should 
profess 
that 
I, 
going 
the 
same 
road 
as 
the 
ancients, 
have 
something 
better 
to 
produce, 
there 
must 
needs 
have 
been 
some 
comparison 
or 
rivalry 
between 
us 
(not 
to 
be 
avoided 
by 
any 
art 
of 
words) 
in 
respect 
of 
excellency 
or 
ability 
of 
wit; 
and 
though 
in 
this 
there 
would 
be 
nothing 
unlawful 
or 
new 
(for 
if 
there 
be 
anything 
misapprehended 
by 
them, 
or 
falsely 
laid 
down, 
why 
may 
not 
I, 
using 
a 
liberty 
common 
to 
all, 
take 
exception 
to 
it?) 
yet 
the 
contest, 
however 
just 
and 
allowable, 
would 
have 
been 
an 
unequal 
one 
perhaps, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
measure 
of 
my 
own 
powers. 
As 
it 
is, 
however 
(my 
object 
being 
to 
open 
a 
new 
way 
for 
the 
understanding, 
a 
way 
by 
them 
untried 
and 
unknown), 
the 
case 
is 
altered: 
party 
zeal 
and 
emulation 
are 
at 
an 
end, 
and 
I 
appear 
merely 
as 
a 
guide 
to 
point 
out 
the 
road 


— 
an 
office 
of 
small 
authority, 
and 
depending 
more 
upon 
a 
kind 
of 
luck 
than 
upon 
any 
ability 
or 
excellency. 
And 
thus 
much 
relates 
to 
the 
persons 
only. 
The 
other 
point 
of 
which 
I 
would 
have 
men 
reminded 
relates 
to 
the 
matter 
itself. 
Be 
it 
remembered 
then 
that 
I 
am 
far 
from 
wishing 
to 
interfere 
with 
the 
philosophy 
which 
now 
flourishes, 
or 
with 
any 
other 
philosophy 
more 
correct 
and 
complete 
than 
this 
which 
has 
been 
or 
may 
hereafter 
be 
propounded. 
For 
I 
do 
not 
object 
to 
the 
use 
of 
this 
received 
philosophy, 
or 
others 
like 
it, 
for 
supplying 
matter 
for 
disputations 
or 
ornaments 
for 
discourse 


— 
for 
the 
professor's 
lecture 
and 
for 
the 
business 
of 
life. 
Nay, 
more, 
I 
declare 
openly 
that 
for 
these 
uses 
the 
philosophy 
which 
I 
bring 
forward 
will 
not 
be 
much 
available. 
It 
does 
not 
lie 
in 
the 
way. 
It 
cannot 
be 
caught 
up 
in 
passage. 
It 
does 
not 
flatter 
the 
understanding 
by 
conformity 
with 
preconceived 
notions. 
Nor 
will 
it 
come 
down 
to 
the 
apprehension 
of 
the 
vulgar 
except 
by 
its 
utility 
and 
effects. 
Let 
there 
be 
therefore 
(and 
may 
it 
be 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
both) 
two 
streams 
and 
two 
dispensations 
of 
knowledge, 
and 
in 
like 
manner 
two 
tribes 
or 
kindreds 
of 
students 
in 
philosophy 
— 
tribes 
not 
hostile 
or 
alien 
to 
each 
other, 
but 
bound 
together 
by 
mutual 
services; 
let 
there 
in 
short 
be 
one 
method 
for 
the 
cultivation, 
another 
for 
the 
invention, 
of 
knowledge. 


And 
for 
those 
who 
prefer 
the 
former, 
either 
from 
hurry 
or 
from 



considerations 
of 
business 
or 
for 
want 
of 
mental 
power 
to 
take 
in 
and 
embrace 
the 
other 
(which 
must 
needs 
be 
most 
men's 
case), 
I 
wish 
that 
they 
may 
succeed 
to 
their 
desire 
in 
what 
they 
are 
about, 
and 
obtain 
what 
they 
are 
pursuing. 
But 
if 
there 
be 
any 
man 
who, 
not 
content 
to 
rest 
in 
and 
use 
the 
knowledge 
which 
has 
already 
been 
discovered, 
aspires 
to 
penetrate 
further; 
to 
overcome, 
not 
an 
adversary 
in 
argument, 
but 
nature 
in 
action; 
to 
seek, 
not 
pretty 
and 
probable 
conjectures, 
but 
certain 
and 
demonstrable 
knowledge 
— 
I 
invite 
all 
such 
to 
join 
themselves, 
as 
true 
sons 
of 
knowledge, 
with 
me, 
that 
passing 
by 
the 
outer 
courts 
of 
nature, 
which 
numbers 
have 
trodden, 
we 
may 
find 
a 
way 
at 
length 
into 
her 
inner 
chambers. 
And 
to 
make 
my 
meaning 
clearer 
and 
to 
familiarize 
the 
thing 
by 
giving 
it 
a 
name, 
I 
have 
chosen 
to 
call 
one 
of 
these 
methods 
or 
ways 
Anticipation 
of 
the 
Mind 
, 
the 
other 
Interpretation 
of 
Nature 
. 


Moreover, 
I 
have 
one 
request 
to 
make. 
I 
have 
on 
my 
own 
part 
made 
it 
my 
care 
and 
study 
that 
the 
things 
which 
I 
shall 
propound 
should 
not 
only 
be 
true, 
but 
should 
also 
be 
presented 
to 
men's 
minds, 
how 
strangely 
soever 
preoccupied 
and 
obstructed, 
in 
a 
manner 
not 
harsh 
or 
unpleasant. 
It 
is 
but 
reasonable, 
however 
(especially 
in 
so 
great 
a 
restoration 
of 
learning 
and 
knowledge), 
that 
I 
should 
claim 
of 
men 
one 
favor 
in 
return, 
which 
is 
this: 
if 
anyone 
would 
form 
an 
opinion 
or 
judgment 
either 
out 
of 
his 
own 
observation, 
or 
out 
of 
the 
crowd 
of 
authorities, 
or 
out 
of 
the 
forms 
of 
demonstration 
(which 
have 
now 
acquired 
a 
sanction 
like 
that 
of 
judicial 
laws), 
concerning 
these 
speculations 
of 
mine, 
let 
him 
not 
hope 
that 
he 
can 
do 
it 
in 
passage 
or 
by 
the 
by; 
but 
let 
him 
examine 
the 
thing 
thoroughly; 
let 
him 
make 
some 
little 
trial 
for 
himself 
of 
the 
way 
which 
I 
describe 
and 
lay 
out; 
let 
him 
familiarize 
his 
thoughts 
with 
that 
subtlety 
of 
nature 
to 
which 
experience 
bears 
witness; 
let 
him 
correct 
by 
seasonable 
patience 
and 
due 
delay 
the 
depraved 
and 
deep-
rooted 
habits 
of 
his 
mind; 
and 
when 
all 
this 
is 
done 
and 
he 
has 
begun 
to 
be 
his 
own 
master, 
let 
him 
(if 
he 
will) 
use 
his 
own 
judgment. 



Aphorisms 


[Book 
One] 


I 


Man, 
being 
the 
servant 
and 
interpreter 
of 
Nature, 
can 
do 
and 
understand 
so 
much 
and 
so 
much 
only 
as 
he 
has 
observed 
in 
fact 
or 
in 
thought 
of 
the 
course 
of 
nature. 
Beyond 
this 
he 
neither 
knows 
anything 
nor 
can 
do 
anything. 


II 


Neither 
the 
naked 
hand 
nor 
the 
understanding 
left 
to 
itself 
can 
effect 
much. 
It 
is 
by 
instruments 
and 
helps 
that 
the 
work 
is 
done, 
which 
are 
as 
much 
wanted 
for 
the 
understanding 
as 
for 
the 
hand. 
And 
as 
the 
instruments 
of 
the 
hand 
either 
give 
motion 
or 
guide 
it, 
so 
the 
instruments 
of 
the 
mind 
supply 
either 
suggestions 
for 
the 
understanding 
or 
cautions. 


III 


Human 
knowledge 
and 
human 
power 
meet 
in 
one; 
for 
where 
the 
cause 
is 
not 
known 
the 
effect 
cannot 
be 
produced. 
Nature 
to 
be 
commanded 
must 
be 
obeyed; 
and 
that 
which 
in 
contemplation 
is 
as 
the 
cause 
is 
in 
operation 
as 
the 
rule. 


IV 


Toward 
the 
effecting 
of 
works, 
all 
that 
man 
can 
do 
is 
to 
put 
together 
or 
put 
asunder 
natural 
bodies. 
The 
rest 
is 
done 
by 
nature 
working 
within. 


V 



The 
study 
of 
nature 
with 
a 
view 
to 
works 
is 
engaged 
in 
by 
the 
mechanic, 
the 
mathematician, 
the 
physician, 
the 
alchemist, 
and 
the 
magician; 
but 
by 
all 
(as 
things 
now 
are) 
with 
slight 
endeavor 
and 
scanty 
success. 


VI 


It 
would 
be 
an 
unsound 
fancy 
and 
self-contradictory 
to 
expect 
that 
things 
which 
have 
never 
yet 
been 
done 
can 
be 
done 
except 
by 
means 
which 
have 
never 
yet 
been 
tried. 


VII 


The 
productions 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
hand 
seem 
very 
numerous 
in 
books 
and 
manufactures. 
But 
all 
this 
variety 
lies 
in 
an 
exquisite 
subtlety 
and 
derivations 
from 
a 
few 
things 
already 
known, 
not 
in 
the 
number 
of 
axioms. 


VIII 


Moreover, 
the 
works 
already 
known 
are 
due 
to 
chance 
and 
experiment 
rather 
than 
to 
sciences; 
for 
the 
sciences 
we 
now 
possess 
are 
merely 
systems 
for 
the 
nice 
ordering 
and 
setting 
forth 
of 
things 
already 
invented, 
not 
methods 
of 
invention 
or 
directions 
for 
new 
works. 


IX 


The 
cause 
and 
root 
of 
nearly 
all 
evils 
in 
the 
sciences 
is 
this 
— 
that 
while 
we 
falsely 
admire 
and 
extol 
the 
powers 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
we 
neglect 
to 
seek 
for 
its 
true 
helps. 


X 


The 
subtlety 
of 
nature 
is 
greater 
many 
times 
over 
than 
the 
subtlety 
of 
the 
senses 
and 
understanding; 
so 
that 
all 
those 
specious 
meditations, 
speculations, 
and 
glosses 
in 
which 
men 
indulge 
are 
quite 
from 
the 
purpose, 
only 
there 
is 
no 
one 
by 
to 
observe 
it. 



XI 


As 
the 
sciences 
which 
we 
now 
have 
do 
not 
help 
us 
in 
finding 
out 
new 
works, 
so 
neither 
does 
the 
logic 
which 
we 
now 
have 
help 
us 
in 
finding 
out 
new 
sciences. 


XII 


The 
logic 
now 
in 
use 
serves 
rather 
to 
fix 
and 
give 
stability 
to 
the 
errors 
which 
have 
their 
foundation 
in 
commonly 
received 
notions 
than 
to 
help 
the 
search 
after 
truth. 
So 
it 
does 
more 
harm 
than 
good. 


XIII 


The 
syllogism 
is 
not 
applied 
to 
the 
first 
principles 
of 
sciences, 
and 
is 
applied 
in 
vain 
to 
intermediate 
axioms, 
being 
no 
match 
for 
the 
subtlety 
of 
nature. 
It 
commands 
assent 
therefore 
to 
the 
proposition, 
but 
does 
not 
take 
hold 
of 
the 
thing. 


XIV 


The 
syllogism 
consists 
of 
propositions, 
propositions 
consist 
of 
words, 
words 
are 
symbols 
of 
notions. 
Therefore 
if 
the 
notions 
themselves 
(which 
is 
the 
root 
of 
the 
matter) 
are 
confused 
and 
overhastily 
abstracted 
from 
the 
facts, 
there 
can 
be 
no 
firmness 
in 
the 
superstructure. 
Our 
only 
hope 
therefore 
lies 
in 
a 
true 
induction. 


XV 


There 
is 
no 
soundness 
in 
our 
notions, 
whether 
logical 
or 
physical. 
Substance, 
Quality, 
Action, 
Passion, 
Essence 
itself, 
are 
not 
sound 
notions; 
much 
less 
are 
Heavy, 
Light, 
Dense, 
Rare, 
Moist, 
Dry, 
Generation, 
Corruption, 
Attraction, 
Repulsion, 
Element, 
Matter, 
Form, 
and 
the 
like; 
but 
all 
are 
fantastical 
and 
ill 
defined. 



XVI 


Our 
notions 
of 
less 
general 
species, 
as 
Man, 
Dog, 
Dove, 
and 
of 
the 
immediate 
perceptions 
of 
the 
sense, 
as 
Hot, 
Cold, 
Black, 
White, 
do 
not 
materially 
mislead 
us; 
yet 
even 
these 
are 
sometimes 
confused 
by 
the 
flux 
and 
alteration 
of 
matter 
and 
the 
mixing 
of 
one 
thing 
with 
another. 
All 
the 
others 
which 
men 
have 
hitherto 
adopted 
are 
but 
wanderings, 
not 
being 
abstracted 
and 
formed 
from 
things 
by 
proper 
methods. 


XVII 


Nor 
is 
there 
less 
of 
willfulness 
and 
wandering 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
axioms 
than 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
notions, 
not 
excepting 
even 
those 
very 
principles 
which 
are 
obtained 
by 
common 
induction; 
but 
much 
more 
in 
the 
axioms 
and 
lower 
propositions 
educed 
by 
the 
syllogism. 


XVIII 


The 
discoveries 
which 
have 
hitherto 
been 
made 
in 
the 
sciences 
are 
such 
as 
lie 
close 
to 
vulgar 
notions, 
scarcely 
beneath 
the 
surface. 
In 
order 
to 
penetrate 
into 
the 
inner 
and 
further 
recesses 
of 
nature, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
both 
notions 
and 
axioms 
be 
derived 
from 
things 
by 
a 
more 
sure 
and 
guarded 
way, 
and 
that 
a 
method 
of 
intellectual 
operation 
be 
introduced 
altogether 
better 
and 
more 
certain. 


XIX 


There 
are 
and 
can 
be 
only 
two 
ways 
of 
searching 
into 
and 
discovering 
truth. 
The 
one 
flies 
from 
the 
senses 
and 
particulars 
to 
the 
most 
general 
axioms, 
and 
from 
these 
principles, 
the 
truth 
of 
which 
it 
takes 
for 
settled 
and 
immovable, 
proceeds 
to 
judgment 
and 
to 
the 
discovery 
of 
middle 
axioms. 
And 
this 
way 
is 
now 
in 
fashion. 
The 
other 
derives 
axioms 
from 
the 
senses 
and 
particulars, 
rising 
by 
a 
gradual 
and 
unbroken 
ascent, 
so 
that 
it 
arrives 
at 
the 
most 
general 
axioms 
last 
of 
all. 
This 
is 
the 
true 
way, 
but 
as 
yet 
untried. 



XX 


The 
understanding 
left 
to 
itself 
takes 
the 
same 
course 
(namely, 
the 
former) 
which 
it 
takes 
in 
accordance 
with 
logical 
order. 
For 
the 
mind 
longs 
to 
spring 
up 
to 
positions 
of 
higher 
generality, 
that 
it 
may 
find 
rest 
there, 
and 
so 
after 
a 
little 
while 
wearies 
of 
experiment. 
But 
this 
evil 
is 
increased 
by 
logic, 
because 
of 
the 
order 
and 
solemnity 
of 
its 
disputations. 


XXI 


The 
understanding 
left 
to 
itself, 
in 
a 
sober, 
patient, 
and 
grave 
mind, 
especially 
if 
it 
be 
not 
hindered 
by 
received 
doctrines, 
tries 
a 
little 
that 
other 
way, 
which 
is 
the 
right 
one, 
but 
with 
little 
progress, 
since 
the 
understanding, 
unless 
directed 
and 
assisted, 
is 
a 
thing 
unequal, 
and 
quite 
unfit 
to 
contend 
with 
the 
obscurity 
of 
things. 


XXII 


Both 
ways 
set 
out 
from 
the 
senses 
and 
particulars, 
and 
rest 
in 
the 
highest 
generalities; 
but 
the 
difference 
between 
them 
is 
infinite. 
For 
the 
one 
just 
glances 
at 
experiment 
and 
particulars 
in 
passing, 
the 
other 
dwells 
duly 
and 
orderly 
among 
them. 


The 
one, 
again, 
begins 
at 
once 
by 
establishing 
certain 
abstract 
and 
useless 
generalities, 
the 
other 
rises 
by 
gradual 
steps 
to 
that 
which 
is 
prior 
and 
better 
known 
in 
the 
order 
of 
nature. 


XXIII 


There 
is 
a 
great 
difference 
between 
the 
Idols 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
and 
the 
Ideas 
of 
the 
divine. 
That 
is 
to 
say, 
between 
certain 
empty 
dogmas, 
and 
the 
true 
signatures 
and 
marks 
set 
upon 
the 
works 
of 
creation 
as 
they 
are 
found 
in 
nature. 


XXIV 



It 
cannot 
be 
that 
axioms 
established 
by 
argumentation 
should 
avail 
for 
the 
discovery 
of 
new 
works, 
since 
the 
subtlety 
of 
nature 
is 
greater 
many 
times 
over 
than 
the 
subtlety 
of 
argument. 
But 
axioms 
duly 
and 
orderly 
formed 
from 
particulars 
easily 
discover 
the 
way 
to 
new 
particulars, 
and 
thus 
render 
sciences 
active. 


XXV 


The 
axioms 
now 
in 
use, 
having 
been 
suggested 
by 
a 
scanty 
and 
manipular 
experience 
and 
a 
few 
particulars 
of 
most 
general 
occurrence, 
are 
made 
for 
the 
most 
part 
just 
large 
enough 
to 
fit 
and 
take 
these 
in; 
and 
therefore 
it 
is 
no 
wonder 
if 
they 
do 
not 
lead 
to 
new 
particulars. 
And 
if 
some 
opposite 
instance, 
not 
observed 
or 
not 
known 
before, 
chance 
to 
come 
in 
the 
way, 
the 
axiom 
is 
rescued 
and 
preserved 
by 
some 
frivolous 
distinction; 
whereas 
the 
truer 
course 
would 
be 
to 
correct 
the 
axiom 
itself. 


XXVI 


The 
conclusions 
of 
human 
reason 
as 
ordinarily 
applied 
in 
matters 
of 
nature, 
I 
call 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
distinction 
Anticipations 
of 
Nature 
(as 
a 
thing 
rash 
or 
premature). 
That 
reason 
which 
is 
elicited 
from 
facts 
by 
a 
just 
and 
methodical 
process, 
I 
call 
Interpretation 
of 
Nature 
. 


XXVII 


Anticipations 
are 
a 
ground 
sufficiently 
firm 
for 
consent, 
for 
even 
if 
men 
went 
mad 
all 
after 
the 
same 
fashion, 
they 
might 
agree 
one 
with 
another 
well 
enough. 


XXVIII 


For 
the 
winning 
of 
assent, 
indeed, 
anticipations 
are 
far 
more 
powerful 
than 
interpretations, 
because 
being 
collected 
from 
a 
few 
instances, 
and 
those 
for 
the 
most 
part 
of 
familiar 
occurrence, 
they 
straightway 
touch 
the 



understanding 
and 
fill 
the 
imagination; 
whereas 
interpretations, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
being 
gathered 
here 
and 
there 
from 
very 
various 
and 
widely 
dispersed 
facts, 
cannot 
suddenly 
strike 
the 
understanding; 
and 
therefore 
they 
must 
needs, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
opinions 
of 
the 
time, 
seem 
harsh 
and 
out 
of 
tune, 
much 
as 
the 
mysteries 
of 
faith 
do. 


XXIX 


In 
sciences 
founded 
on 
opinions 
and 
dogmas, 
the 
use 
of 
anticipations 
and 
logic 
is 
good; 
for 
in 
them 
the 
object 
is 
to 
command 
assent 
to 
the 
proposition, 
not 
to 
master 
the 
thing. 


XXX 


Though 
all 
the 
wits 
of 
all 
the 
ages 
should 
meet 
together 
and 
combine 
and 
transmit 
their 
labors, 
yet 
will 
no 
great 
progress 
ever 
be 
made 
in 
science 
by 
means 
of 
anticipations; 
because 
radical 
errors 
in 
the 
first 
concoction 
of 
the 
mind 
are 
not 
to 
be 
cured 
by 
the 
excellence 
of 
functions 
and 
subsequent 
remedies. 


XXXI 


It 
is 
idle 
to 
expect 
any 
great 
advancement 
in 
science 
from 
the 
superinducing 
and 
engrafting 
of 
new 
things 
upon 
old. 
We 
must 
begin 
anew 
from 
the 
very 
foundations, 
unless 
we 
would 
revolve 
forever 
in 
a 
circle 
with 
mean 
and 
contemptible 
progress. 


XXXII 


The 
honor 
of 
the 
ancient 
authors, 
and 
indeed 
of 
all, 
remains 
untouched, 
since 
the 
comparison 
I 
challenge 
is 
not 
of 
wits 
or 
faculties, 
but 
of 
ways 
and 
methods, 
and 
the 
part 
I 
take 
upon 
myself 
is 
not 
that 
of 
a 
judge, 
but 
of 
a 
guide. 


XXXIII 



This 
must 
be 
plainly 
avowed: 
no 
judgment 
can 
be 
rightly 
formed 
either 
of 
my 
method 
or 
of 
the 
discoveries 
to 
which 
it 
leads, 
by 
means 
of 
anticipations 
(that 
is 
to 
say, 
of 
the 
reasoning 
which 
is 
now 
in 
use); 
since 
I 
cannot 
be 
called 
on 
to 
abide 
by 
the 
sentence 
of 
a 
tribunal 
which 
is 
itself 
on 
trial. 


XXXIV 


Even 
to 
deliver 
and 
explain 
what 
I 
bring 
forward 
is 
no 
easy 
matter, 
for 
things 
in 
themselves 
new 
will 
yet 
be 
apprehended 
with 
reference 
to 
what 
is 
old. 


XXXV 


It 
was 
said 
by 
Borgia 
of 
the 
expedition 
of 
the 
French 
into 
Italy, 
that 
they 
came 
with 
chalk 
in 
their 
hands 
to 
mark 
out 
their 
lodgings, 
not 
with 
arms 
to 
force 
their 
way 
in. 
I 
in 
like 
manner 
would 
have 
my 
doctrine 
enter 
quietly 
into 
the 
minds 
that 
are 
fit 
and 
capable 
of 
receiving 
it; 
for 
confutations 
cannot 
be 
employed 
when 
the 
difference 
is 
upon 
first 
principles 
and 
very 
notions, 
and 
even 
upon 
forms 
of 
demonstration. 


XXXVI 


One 
method 
of 
delivery 
alone 
remains 
to 
us 
which 
is 
simply 
this: 
we 
must 
lead 
men 
to 
the 
particulars 
themselves, 
and 
their 
series 
and 
order; 
while 
men 
on 
their 
side 
must 
force 
themselves 
for 
a 
while 
to 
lay 
their 
notions 
by 
and 
begin 
to 
familiarize 
themselves 
with 
facts. 


XXXVII 


The 
doctrine 
of 
those 
who 
have 
denied 
that 
certainty 
could 
be 
attained 
at 
all 
has 
some 
agreement 
with 
my 
way 
of 
proceeding 
at 
the 
first 
setting 
out; 
but 
they 
end 
in 
being 
infinitely 
separated 
and 
opposed. 
For 
the 
holders 
of 
that 
doctrine 
assert 
simply 
that 
nothing 
can 
be 
known. 
I 
also 
assert 



that 
not 
much 
can 
be 
known 
in 
nature 
by 
the 
way 
which 
is 
now 
in 
use. 
But 
then 
they 
go 
on 
to 
destroy 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
senses 
and 
understanding; 
whereas 
I 
proceed 
to 
devise 
and 
supply 
helps 
for 
the 
same. 


XXXVIII 


The 
idols 
and 
false 
notions 
which 
are 
now 
in 
possession 
of 
the 
human 
understanding, 
and 
have 
taken 
deep 
root 
therein, 
not 
only 
so 
beset 
men's 
minds 
that 
truth 
can 
hardly 
find 
entrance, 
but 
even 
after 
entrance 
is 
obtained, 
they 
will 
again 
in 
the 
very 
instauration 
of 
the 
sciences 
meet 
and 
trouble 
us, 
unless 
men 
being 
forewarned 
of 
the 
danger 
fortify 
themselves 
as 
far 
as 
may 
be 
against 
their 
assaults. 


XXXIX 


There 
are 
four 
classes 
of 
Idols 
which 
beset 
men's 
minds. 
To 
these 
for 
distinction's 
sake 
I 
have 
assigned 
names, 
calling 
the 
first 
class 
Idols 
of 
the 
Tribe; 
the 
second, 
Idols 
of 
the 
Cave; 
the 
third, 
Idols 
of 
the 
Market 
Place 
; 
the 
fourth, 
Idols 
of 
the 
Theater 
. 


XL 


The 
formation 
of 
ideas 
and 
axioms 
by 
true 
induction 
is 
no 
doubt 
the 
proper 
remedy 
to 
be 
applied 
for 
the 
keeping 
off 
and 
clearing 
away 
of 
idols. 
To 
point 
them 
out, 
however, 
is 
of 
great 
use; 
for 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Idols 
is 
to 
the 
interpretation 
of 
nature 
what 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
refutation 
of 
sophisms 
is 
to 
common 
logic. 


XLI 


The 
Idols 
of 
the 
Tribe 
have 
their 
foundation 
in 
human 
nature 
itself, 
and 
in 
the 
tribe 
or 
race 
of 
men. 
For 
it 
is 
a 
false 
assertion 
that 
the 
sense 
of 
man 
is 
the 
measure 
of 
things. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
all 
perceptions 
as 
well 
of 
the 
sense 
as 
of 
the 
mind 
are 
according 
to 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
individual 
and 
not 
according 
to 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
universe. 
And 
the 
human 
understanding 
is 



like 
a 
false 
mirror, 
which, 
receiving 
rays 
irregularly, 
distorts 
and 
discolors 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
by 
mingling 
its 
own 
nature 
with 
it. 


XLII 


The 
Idols 
of 
the 
Cave 
are 
the 
idols 
of 
the 
individual 
man. 
For 
everyone 
(besides 
the 
errors 
common 
to 
human 
nature 
in 
general) 
has 
a 
cave 
or 
den 
of 
his 
own, 
which 
refracts 
and 
discolors 
the 
light 
of 
nature, 
owing 
either 
to 
his 
own 
proper 
and 
peculiar 
nature; 
or 
to 
his 
education 
and 
conversation 
with 
others; 
or 
to 
the 
reading 
of 
books, 
and 
the 
authority 
of 
those 
whom 
he 
esteems 
and 
admires; 
or 
to 
the 
differences 
of 
impressions, 
accordingly 
as 
they 
take 
place 
in 
a 
mind 
preoccupied 
and 
predisposed 
or 
in 
a 
mind 
indifferent 
and 
settled; 
or 
the 
like. 
So 
that 
the 
spirit 
of 
man 
(according 
as 
it 
is 
meted 
out 
to 
different 
individuals) 
is 
in 
fact 
a 
thing 
variable 
and 
full 
of 
perturbation, 
and 
governed 
as 
it 
were 
by 
chance. 
Whence 
it 
was 
well 
observed 
by 
Heraclitus 
that 
men 
look 
for 
sciences 
in 
their 
own 
lesser 
worlds, 
and 
not 
in 
the 
greater 
or 
common 
world. 


XLIII 


There 
are 
also 
Idols 
formed 
by 
the 
intercourse 
and 
association 
of 
men 
with 
each 
other, 
which 
I 
call 
Idols 
of 
the 
Market 
Place, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
commerce 
and 
consort 
of 
men 
there. 
For 
it 
is 
by 
discourse 
that 
men 
associate, 
and 
words 
are 
imposed 
according 
to 
the 
apprehension 
of 
the 
vulgar. 
And 
therefore 
the 
ill 
and 
unfit 
choice 
of 
words 
wonderfully 
obstructs 
the 
understanding. 
Nor 
do 
the 
definitions 
or 
explanations 
wherewith 
in 
some 
things 
learned 
men 
are 
wont 
to 
guard 
and 
defend 
themselves, 
by 
any 
means 
set 
the 
matter 
right. 
But 
words 
plainly 
force 
and 
overrule 
the 
understanding, 
and 
throw 
all 
into 
confusion, 
and 
lead 
men 
away 
into 
numberless 
empty 
controversies 
and 
idle 
fancies. 


XLIV 


Lastly, 
there 
are 
Idols 
which 
have 
immigrated 
into 
men's 
minds 
from 
the 
various 
dogmas 
of 
philosophies, 
and 
also 
from 
wrong 
laws 
of 
demonstration. 
These 
I 
call 
Idols 
of 
the 
Theater, 
because 
in 
my 
judgment 
all 



the 
received 
systems 
are 
but 
so 
many 
stage 
plays, 
representing 
worlds 
of 
their 
own 
creation 
after 
an 
unreal 
and 
scenic 
fashion. 
Nor 
is 
it 
only 
of 
the 
systems 
now 
in 
vogue, 
or 
only 
of 
the 
ancient 
sects 
and 
philosophies, 
that 
I 
speak; 
for 
many 
more 
plays 
of 
the 
same 
kind 
may 
yet 
be 
composed 
and 
in 
like 
artificial 
manner 
set 
forth; 
seeing 
that 
errors 
the 
most 
widely 
different 
have 
nevertheless 
causes 
for 
the 
most 
part 
alike. 
Neither 
again 
do 
I 
mean 
this 
only 
of 
entire 
systems, 
but 
also 
of 
many 
principles 
and 
axioms 
in 
science, 
which 
by 
tradition, 
credulity, 
and 
negligence 
have 
come 
to 
be 
received. 


But 
of 
these 
several 
kinds 
of 
Idols 
I 
must 
speak 
more 
largely 
and 
exactly, 
that 
the 
understanding 
may 
be 
duly 
cautioned. 


XLV 


The 
human 
understanding 
is 
of 
its 
own 
nature 
prone 
to 
suppose 
the 
existence 
of 
more 
order 
and 
regularity 
in 
the 
world 
than 
it 
finds. 
And 
though 
there 
be 
many 
things 
in 
nature 
which 
are 
singular 
and 
unmatched, 
yet 
it 
devises 
for 
them 
parallels 
and 
conjugates 
and 
relatives 
which 
do 
not 
exist. 
Hence 
the 
fiction 
that 
all 
celestial 
bodies 
move 
in 
perfect 
circles, 
spirals 
and 
dragons 
being 
(except 
in 
name) 
utterly 
rejected. 
Hence 
too 
the 
element 
of 
fire 
with 
its 
orb 
is 
brought 
in, 
to 
make 
up 
the 
square 
with 
the 
other 
three 
which 
the 
sense 
perceives. 
Hence 
also 
the 
ratio 
of 
density 
of 
the 
so-called 
elements 
is 
arbitrarily 
fixed 
at 
ten 
to 
one. 
And 
so 
on 
of 
other 
dreams. 
And 
these 
fancies 
affect 
not 
dogmas 
only, 
but 
simple 
notions 
also. 


XLVI 


The 
human 
understanding 
when 
it 
has 
once 
adopted 
an 
opinion 
(either 
as 
being 
the 
received 
opinion 
or 
as 
being 
agreeable 
to 
itself) 
draws 
all 
things 
else 
to 
support 
and 
agree 
with 
it. 
And 
though 
there 
be 
a 
greater 
number 
and 
weight 
of 
instances 
to 
be 
found 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
yet 
these 
it 
either 
neglects 
and 
despises, 
or 
else 
by 
some 
distinction 
sets 
aside 
and 
rejects, 
in 
order 
that 
by 
this 
great 
and 
pernicious 
predetermination 
the 
authority 
of 
its 
former 
conclusions 
may 
remain 
inviolate. 
And 
therefore 
it 
was 
a 
good 
answer 
that 
was 
made 
by 
one 
who, 
when 
they 
showed 
him 
hanging 
in 
a 
temple 
a 
picture 
of 
those 
who 
had 
paid 
their 
vows 
as 
having 
escaped 
shipwreck, 
and 
would 
have 
him 
say 
whether 
he 
did 
not 
now 
acknowledge 
the 
power 
of 
the 



gods 
— 
"Aye," 
asked 
he 
again, 
"but 
where 
are 
they 
painted 
that 
were 
drowned 
after 
their 
vows?" 
And 
such 
is 
the 
way 
of 
all 
superstition, 
whether 
in 
astrology, 
dreams, 
omens, 
divine 
judgments, 
or 
the 
like; 
wherein 
men, 
having 
a 
delight 
in 
such 
vanities, 
mark 
the 
events 
where 
they 
are 
fulfilled, 
but 
where 
they 
fail, 
though 
this 
happen 
much 
oftener, 
neglect 
and 
pass 
them 
by. 
But 
with 
far 
more 
subtlety 
does 
this 
mischief 
insinuate 
itself 
into 
philosophy 
and 
the 
sciences; 
in 
which 
the 
first 
conclusion 
colors 
and 
brings 
into 
conformity 
with 
itself 
all 
that 
come 
after, 
though 
far 
sounder 
and 
better. 
Besides, 
independently 
of 
that 
delight 
and 
vanity 
which 
I 
have 
described, 
it 
is 
the 
peculiar 
and 
perpetual 
error 
of 
the 
human 
intellect 
to 
be 
more 
moved 
and 
excited 
by 
affirmatives 
than 
by 
negatives; 
whereas 
it 
ought 
properly 
to 
hold 
itself 
indifferently 
disposed 
toward 
both 
alike. 
Indeed, 
in 
the 
establishment 
of 
any 
true 
axiom, 
the 
negative 
instance 
is 
the 
more 
forcible 
of 
the 
two. 


XLVII 


The 
human 
understanding 
is 
moved 
by 
those 
things 
most 
which 
strike 
and 
enter 
the 
mind 
simultaneously 
and 
suddenly, 
and 
so 
fill 
the 
imagination; 
and 
then 
it 
feigns 
and 
supposes 
all 
other 
things 
to 
be 
somehow, 
though 
it 
cannot 
see 
how, 
similar 
to 
those 
few 
things 
by 
which 
it 
is 
surrounded. 
But 
for 
that 
going 
to 
and 
fro 
to 
remote 
and 
heterogeneous 
instances 
by 
which 
axioms 
are 
tried 
as 
in 
the 
fire, 
the 
intellect 
is 
altogether 
slow 
and 
unfit, 
unless 
it 
be 
forced 
thereto 
by 
severe 
laws 
and 
overruling 
authority. 


XLVIII 


The 
human 
understanding 
is 
unquiet; 
it 
cannot 
stop 
or 
rest, 
and 
still 
presses 
onward, 
but 
in 
vain. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
that 
we 
cannot 
conceive 
of 
any 
end 
or 
limit 
to 
the 
world, 
but 
always 
as 
of 
necessity 
it 
occurs 
to 
us 
that 
there 
is 
something 
beyond. 
Neither, 
again, 
can 
it 
be 
conceived 
how 
eternity 
has 
flowed 
down 
to 
the 
present 
day, 
for 
that 
distinction 
which 
is 
commonly 
received 
of 
infinity 
in 
time 
past 
and 
in 
time 
to 
come 
can 
by 
no 
means 
hold; 
for 
it 
would 
thence 
follow 
that 
one 
infinity 
is 
greater 
than 
another, 
and 
that 
infinity 
is 
wasting 
away 
and 
tending 
to 
become 
finite. 
The 
like 
subtlety 
arises 
touching 
the 
infinite 
divisibility 
of 
lines, 
from 
the 
same 
inability 
of 
thought 
to 



stop. 
But 
this 
inability 
interferes 
more 
mischievously 
in 
the 
discovery 
of 
causes; 
for 
although 
the 
most 
general 
principles 
in 
nature 
ought 
to 
be 
held 
merely 
positive, 
as 
they 
are 
discovered, 
and 
cannot 
with 
truth 
be 
referred 
to 
a 
cause, 
nevertheless 
the 
human 
understanding 
being 
unable 
to 
rest 
still 
seeks 
something 
prior 
in 
the 
order 
of 
nature. 
And 
then 
it 
is 
that 
in 
struggling 
toward 
that 
which 
is 
further 
off 
it 
falls 
back 
upon 
that 
which 
is 
nearer 
at 
hand, 
namely, 
on 
final 
causes, 
which 
have 
relation 
clearly 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
man 
rather 
than 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
universe; 
and 
from 
this 
source 
have 
strangely 
defiled 
philosophy. 
But 
he 
is 
no 
less 
an 
unskilled 
and 
shallow 
philosopher 
who 
seeks 
causes 
of 
that 
which 
is 
most 
general, 
than 
he 
who 
in 
things 
subordinate 
and 
subaltern 
omits 
to 
do 
so. 


XLIX 


The 
human 
understanding 
is 
no 
dry 
light, 
but 
receives 
an 
infusion 
from 
the 
will 
and 
affections; 
whence 
proceed 
sciences 
which 
may 
be 
called 
"sciences 
as 
one 
would." 
For 
what 
a 
man 
had 
rather 
were 
true 
he 
more 
readily 
believes. 
Therefore 
he 
rejects 
difficult 
things 
from 
impatience 
of 
research; 
sober 
things, 
because 
they 
narrow 
hope; 
the 
deeper 
things 
of 
nature, 
from 
superstition; 
the 
light 
of 
experience, 
from 
arrogance 
and 
pride, 
lest 
his 
mind 
should 
seem 
to 
be 
occupied 
with 
things 
mean 
and 
transitory; 
things 
not 
commonly 
believed, 
out 
of 
deference 
to 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
vulgar. 
Numberless, 
in 
short, 
are 
the 
ways, 
and 
sometimes 
imperceptible, 
in 
which 
the 
affections 
color 
and 
infect 
the 
understanding. 


L 


But 
by 
far 
the 
greatest 
hindrance 
and 
aberration 
of 
the 
human 
understanding 
proceeds 
from 
the 
dullness, 
incompetency, 
and 
deceptions 
of 
the 
senses; 
in 
that 
things 
which 
strike 
the 
sense 
outweigh 
things 
which 
do 
not 
immediately 
strike 
it, 
though 
they 
be 
more 
important. 
Hence 
it 
is 
that 
speculation 
commonly 
ceases 
where 
sight 
ceases; 
insomuch 
that 
of 
things 
invisible 
there 
is 
little 
or 
no 
observation. 
Hence 
all 
the 
working 
of 
the 
spirits 
enclosed 
in 
tangible 
bodies 
lies 
hid 
and 
unobserved 
of 
men. 
So 
also 
all 
the 
more 
subtle 
changes 
of 
form 
in 
the 
parts 
of 
coarser 
substances 
(which 
they 
commonly 
call 
alteration, 
though 
it 
is 
in 
truth 
local 
motion 
through 



exceedingly 
small 
spaces) 
is 
in 
like 
manner 
unobserved. 
And 
yet 
unless 
these 
two 
things 
just 
mentioned 
be 
searched 
out 
and 
brought 
to 
light, 
nothing 
great 
can 
be 
achieved 
in 
nature, 
as 
far 
as 
the 
production 
of 
works 
is 
concerned. 
So 
again 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
our 
common 
air, 
and 
of 
all 
bodies 
less 
dense 
than 
air 
(which 
are 
very 
many), 
is 
almost 
unknown. 
For 
the 
sense 
by 
itself 
is 
a 
thing 
infirm 
and 
erring; 
neither 
can 
instruments 
for 
enlarging 
or 
sharpening 
the 
senses 
do 
much; 
but 
all 
the 
truer 
kind 
of 
interpretation 
of 
nature 
is 
effected 
by 
instances 
and 
experiments 
fit 
and 
apposite; 
wherein 
the 
sense 
decides 
touching 
the 
experiment 
only, 
and 
the 
experiment 
touching 
the 
point 
in 
nature 
and 
the 
thing 
itself. 


LI 


The 
human 
understanding 
is 
of 
its 
own 
nature 
prone 
to 
abstractions 
and 
gives 
a 
substance 
and 
reality 
to 
things 
which 
are 
fleeting. 
But 
to 
resolve 
nature 
into 
abstractions 
is 
less 
to 
our 
purpose 
than 
to 
dissect 
her 
into 
parts; 
as 
did 
the 
school 
of 
Democritus, 
which 
went 
further 
into 
nature 
than 
the 
rest. 
Matter 
rather 
than 
forms 
should 
be 
the 
object 
of 
our 
attention, 
its 
configurations 
and 
changes 
of 
configuration, 
and 
simple 
action, 
and 
law 
of 
action 
or 
motion; 
for 
forms 
are 
figments 
of 
the 
human 
mind, 
unless 
you 
will 
call 
those 
laws 
of 
action 
forms. 


LII 


Such 
then 
are 
the 
idols 
which 
I 
call 
Idols 
of 
the 
Tribe 
, 
and 
which 
take 
their 
rise 
either 
from 
the 
homogeneity 
of 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
human 
spirit, 
or 
from 
its 
preoccupation, 
or 
from 
its 
narrowness, 
or 
from 
its 
restless 
motion, 
or 
from 
an 
infusion 
of 
the 
affections, 
or 
from 
the 
incompetency 
of 
the 
senses, 
or 
from 
the 
mode 
of 
impression. 


LIII 


The 
Idols 
of 
the 
Cave 
take 
their 
rise 
in 
the 
peculiar 
constitution, 
mental 
or 
bodily, 
of 
each 
individual; 
and 
also 
in 
education, 
habit, 
and 
accident. 
Of 
this 
kind 
there 
is 
a 
great 
number 
and 
variety. 
But 
I 
will 
instance 
those 
the 
pointing 
out 
of 
which 
contains 
the 
most 
important 
caution, 
and 



which 
have 
most 
effect 
in 
disturbing 
the 
clearness 
of 
the 
understanding. 


LIV 


Men 
become 
attached 
to 
certain 
particular 
sciences 
and 
speculations, 
either 
because 
they 
fancy 
themselves 
the 
authors 
and 
inventors 
thereof, 
or 
because 
they 
have 
bestowed 
the 
greatest 
pains 
upon 
them 
and 
become 
most 
habituated 
to 
them. 
But 
men 
of 
this 
kind, 
if 
they 
betake 
themselves 
to 
philosophy 
and 
contemplation 
of 
a 
general 
character, 
distort 
and 
color 
them 
in 
obedience 
to 
their 
former 
fancies; 
a 
thing 
especially 
to 
be 
noticed 
in 
Aristotle, 
who 
made 
his 
natural 
philosophy 
a 
mere 
bond 
servant 
to 
his 
logic, 
thereby 
rendering 
it 
contentious 
and 
well-nigh 
useless. 
The 
race 
of 
chemists, 
again 
out 
of 
a 
few 
experiments 
of 
the 
furnace, 
have 
built 
up 
a 
fantastic 
philosophy, 
framed 
with 
reference 
to 
a 
few 
things; 
and 
Gilbert 
also, 
after 
he 
had 
employed 
himself 
most 
laboriously 
in 
the 
study 
and 
observation 
of 
the 
loadstone, 
proceeded 
at 
once 
to 
construct 
an 
entire 
system 
in 
accordance 
with 
his 
favorite 
subject. 


LV 


There 
is 
one 
principal 
and 
as 
it 
were 
radical 
distinction 
between 
different 
minds, 
in 
respect 
of 
philosophy 
and 
the 
sciences, 
which 
is 
this: 
that 
some 
minds 
are 
stronger 
and 
apter 
to 
mark 
the 
differences 
of 
things, 
others 
to 
mark 
their 
resemblances. 
The 
steady 
and 
acute 
mind 
can 
fix 
its 
contemplations 
and 
dwell 
and 
fasten 
on 
the 
subtlest 
distinctions; 
the 
lofty 
and 
discursive 
mind 
recognizes 
and 
puts 
together 
the 
finest 
and 
most 
general 
resemblances. 
Both 
kinds, 
however, 
easily 
err 
in 
excess, 
by 
catching 
the 
one 
at 
gradations, 
the 
other 
at 
shadows. 


LVI 


There 
are 
found 
some 
minds 
given 
to 
an 
extreme 
admiration 
of 
antiquity, 
others 
to 
an 
extreme 
love 
and 
appetite 
for 
novelty; 
but 
few 
so 
duly 
tempered 
that 
they 
can 
hold 
the 
mean, 
neither 
carping 
at 
what 
has 
been 
well 
laid 
down 
by 
the 
ancients, 
nor 
despising 
what 
is 
well 
introduced 
by 
the 
moderns. 
This, 
however, 
turns 
to 
the 
great 
injury 
of 
the 
sciences 
and 



philosophy, 
since 
these 
affectations 
of 
antiquity 
and 
novelty 
are 
the 
humors 
of 
partisans 
rather 
than 
judgments; 
and 
truth 
is 
to 
be 
sought 
for 
not 
in 
the 
felicity 
of 
any 
age, 
which 
is 
an 
unstable 
thing, 
but 
in 
the 
light 
of 
nature 
and 
experience, 
which 
is 
eternal. 
These 
factions 
therefore 
must 
be 
abjured, 
and 
care 
must 
be 
taken 
that 
the 
intellect 
be 
not 
hurried 
by 
them 
into 
assent. 


LVII 


Contemplations 
of 
nature 
and 
of 
bodies 
in 
their 
simple 
form 
break 
up 
and 
distract 
the 
understanding, 
while 
contemplations 
of 
nature 
and 
bodies 
in 
their 
composition 
and 
configuration 
overpower 
and 
dissolve 
the 
understanding, 
a 
distinction 
well 
seen 
in 
the 
school 
of 
Leucippus 
and 
Democritus 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
other 
philosophies. 
For 
that 
school 
is 
so 
busied 
with 
the 
particles 
that 
it 
hardly 
attends 
to 
the 
structure, 
while 
the 
others 
are 
so 
lost 
in 
admiration 
of 
the 
structure 
that 
they 
do 
not 
penetrate 
to 
the 
simplicity 
of 
nature. 
These 
kinds 
of 
contemplation 
should 
therefore 
be 
alternated 
and 
taken 
by 
turns, 
so 
that 
the 
understanding 
may 
be 
rendered 
at 
once 
penetrating 
and 
comprehensive, 
and 
the 
inconveniences 
above 
mentioned, 
with 
the 
idols 
which 
proceed 
from 
them, 
may 
be 
avoided. 


LVIII 


Let 
such 
then 
be 
our 
provision 
and 
contemplative 
prudence 
for 
keeping 
off 
and 
dislodging 
the 
Idols 
of 
the 
Cave 
, 
which 
grow 
for 
the 
most 
part 
either 
out 
of 
the 
predominance 
of 
a 
favorite 
subject, 
or 
out 
of 
an 
excessive 
tendency 
to 
compare 
or 
to 
distinguish, 
or 
out 
of 
partiality 
for 
particular 
ages, 
or 
out 
of 
the 
largeness 
or 
minuteness 
of 
the 
objects 
contemplated. 
And 
generally 
let 
every 
student 
of 
nature 
take 
this 
as 
a 
rule: 
that 
whatever 
his 
mind 
seizes 
and 
dwells 
upon 
with 
peculiar 
satisfaction 
is 
to 
be 
held 
in 
suspicion, 
and 
that 
so 
much 
the 
more 
care 
is 
to 
be 
taken 
in 
dealing 
with 
such 
questions 
to 
keep 
the 
understanding 
even 
and 
clear. 


LIX 


But 
the 
Idols 
of 
the 
Market 
Place 
are 
the 
most 
troublesome 
of 
all 
— 
idols 
which 
have 
crept 
into 
the 
understanding 
through 
the 
alliances 
of 
words 



and 
names. 
For 
men 
believe 
that 
their 
reason 
governs 
words; 
but 
it 
is 
also 
true 
that 
words 
react 
on 
the 
understanding; 
and 
this 
it 
is 
that 
has 
rendered 
philosophy 
and 
the 
sciences 
sophistical 
and 
inactive. 
Now 
words, 
being 
commonly 
framed 
and 
applied 
according 
to 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
vulgar, 
follow 
those 
lines 
of 
division 
which 
are 
most 
obvious 
to 
the 
vulgar 
understanding. 
And 
whenever 
an 
understanding 
of 
greater 
acuteness 
or 
a 
more 
diligent 
observation 
would 
alter 
those 
lines 
to 
suit 
the 
true 
divisions 
of 
nature, 
words 
stand 
in 
the 
way 
and 
resist 
the 
change. 
Whence 
it 
comes 
to 
pass 
that 
the 
high 
and 
formal 
discussions 
of 
learned 
men 
end 
oftentimes 
in 
disputes 
about 
words 
and 
names; 
with 
which 
(according 
to 
the 
use 
and 
wisdom 
of 
the 
mathematicians) 
it 
would 
be 
more 
prudent 
to 
begin, 
and 
so 
by 
means 
of 
definitions 
reduce 
them 
to 
order. 
Yet 
even 
definitions 
cannot 
cure 
this 
evil 
in 
dealing 
with 
natural 
and 
material 
things, 
since 
the 
definitions 
themselves 
consist 
of 
words, 
and 
those 
words 
beget 
others. 
So 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
recur 
to 
individual 
instances, 
and 
those 
in 
due 
series 
and 
order, 
as 
I 
shall 
say 
presently 
when 
I 
come 
to 
the 
method 
and 
scheme 
for 
the 
formation 
of 
notions 
and 
axioms. 


LX 


The 
idols 
imposed 
by 
words 
on 
the 
understanding 
are 
of 
two 
kinds. 
They 
are 
either 
names 
of 
things 
which 
do 
not 
exist 
(for 
as 
there 
are 
things 
left 
unnamed 
through 
lack 
of 
observation, 
so 
likewise 
are 
there 
names 
which 
result 
from 
fantastic 
suppositions 
and 
to 
which 
nothing 
in 
reality 
corresponds), 
or 
they 
are 
names 
of 
things 
which 
exist, 
but 
yet 
confused 
and 
ill-defined, 
and 
hastily 
and 
irregularly 
derived 
from 
realities. 
Of 
the 
former 
kind 
are 
Fortune, 
the 
Prime 
Mover, 
Planetary 
Orbits, 
Element 
of 
Fire, 
and 
like 
fictions 
which 
owe 
their 
origin 
to 
false 
and 
idle 
theories. 
And 
this 
class 
of 
idols 
is 
more 
easily 
expelled, 
because 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
them 
it 
is 
only 
necessary 
that 
all 
theories 
should 
be 
steadily 
rejected 
and 
dismissed 
as 
obsolete. 


But 
the 
other 
class, 
which 
springs 
out 
of 
a 
faulty 
and 
unskillful 
abstraction, 
is 
intricate 
and 
deeply 
rooted. 
Let 
us 
take 
for 
example 
such 
a 
word 
as 
humid 
and 
see 
how 
far 
the 
several 
things 
which 
the 
word 
is 
used 
to 
signify 
agree 
with 
each 
other, 
and 
we 
shall 
find 
the 
word 
humid 
to 
be 
nothing 
else 
than 
a 
mark 
loosely 
and 
confusedly 
applied 
to 
denote 
a 
variety 
of 
actions 



which 
will 
not 
bear 
to 
be 
reduced 
to 
any 
constant 
meaning. 
For 
it 
both 
signifies 
that 
which 
easily 
spreads 
itself 
round 
any 
other 
body; 
and 
that 
which 
in 
itself 
is 
indeterminate 
and 
cannot 
solidize; 
and 
that 
which 
readily 
yields 
in 
every 
direction; 
and 
that 
which 
easily 
divides 
and 
scatters 
itself; 
and 
that 
which 
easily 
unites 
and 
collects 
itself; 
and 
that 
which 
readily 
flows 
and 
is 
put 
in 
motion; 
and 
that 
which 
readily 
clings 
to 
another 
body 
and 
wets 
it; 
and 
that 
which 
is 
easily 
reduced 
to 
a 
liquid, 
or 
being 
solid 
easily 
melts. 
Accordingly, 
when 
you 
come 
to 
apply 
the 
word, 
if 
you 
take 
it 
in 
one 
sense, 
flame 
is 
humid; 
if 
in 
another, 
air 
is 
not 
humid; 
if 
in 
another, 
fine 
dust 
is 
humid; 
if 
in 
another, 
glass 
is 
humid. 
So 
that 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
see 
that 
the 
notion 
is 
taken 
by 
abstraction 
only 
from 
water 
and 
common 
and 
ordinary 
liquids, 
without 
any 
due 
verification. 


There 
are, 
however, 
in 
words 
certain 
degrees 
of 
distortion 
and 
error. 
One 
of 
the 
least 
faulty 
kinds 
is 
that 
of 
names 
of 
substances, 
especially 
of 
lowest 
species 
and 
well-deduced 
(for 
the 
notion 
of 
chalk 
and 
of 
mud 
is 
good, 
of 
earth 
bad); 
a 
more 
faulty 
kind 
is 
that 
of 
actions, 
as 
to 
generate, 
to 
corrupt, 
to 
alter 
; 
the 
most 
faulty 
is 
of 
qualities 
(except 
such 
as 
are 
the 
immediate 
objects 
of 
the 
sense) 
as 
heavy, 
light, 
rare, 
dense 
, 
and 
the 
like. 
Yet 
in 
all 
these 
cases 
some 
notions 
are 
of 
necessity 
a 
little 
better 
than 
others, 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
greater 
variety 
of 
subjects 
that 
fall 
within 
the 
range 
of 
the 
human 
sense. 


LXI 


But 
the 
Idols 
of 
the 
Theater 
are 
not 
innate, 
nor 
do 
they 
steal 
into 
the 
understanding 
secretly, 
but 
are 
plainly 
impressed 
and 
received 
into 
the 
mind 
from 
the 
playbooks 
of 
philosophical 
systems 
and 
the 
perverted 
rules 
of 
demonstration. 
To 
attempt 
refutations 
in 
this 
case 
would 
be 
merely 
inconsistent 
with 
what 
I 
have 
already 
said, 
for 
since 
we 
agree 
neither 
upon 
principles 
nor 
upon 
demonstrations 
there 
is 
no 
place 
for 
argument. 
And 
this 
is 
so 
far 
well, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
leaves 
the 
honor 
of 
the 
ancients 
untouched. 
For 
they 
are 
no 
wise 
disparaged 
— 
the 
question 
between 
them 
and 
me 
being 
only 
as 
to 
the 
way. 
For 
as 
the 
saying 
is, 
the 
lame 
man 
who 
keeps 
the 
right 
road 
outstrips 
the 
runner 
who 
takes 
a 
wrong 
one. 
Nay, 
it 
is 
obvious 
that 
when 
a 
man 
runs 
the 
wrong 
way, 
the 
more 
active 
and 
swift 
he 
is, 
the 
further 
he 
will 
go 
astray. 


But 
the 
course 
I 
propose 
for 
the 
discovery 
of 
sciences 
is 
such 
as 



leaves 
but 
little 
to 
the 
acuteness 
and 
strength 
of 
wits, 
but 
places 
all 
wits 
and 
understandings 
nearly 
on 
a 
level. 
For 
as 
in 
the 
drawing 
of 
a 
straight 
line 
or 
a 
perfect 
circle, 
much 
depends 
on 
the 
steadiness 
and 
practice 
of 
the 
hand, 
if 
it 
be 
done 
by 
aim 
of 
hand 
only, 
but 
if 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
rule 
or 
compass, 
little 
or 
nothing; 
so 
is 
it 
exactly 
with 
my 
plan. 
But 
though 
particular 
confutations 
would 
be 
of 
no 
avail, 
yet 
touching 
the 
sects 
and 
general 
divisions 
of 
such 
systems 
I 
must 
say 
something; 
something 
also 
touching 
the 
external 
signs 
which 
show 
that 
they 
are 
unsound; 
and 
finally 
something 
touching 
the 
causes 
of 
such 
great 
infelicity 
and 
of 
such 
lasting 
and 
general 
agreement 
in 
error; 
that 
so 
the 
access 
to 
truth 
may 
be 
made 
less 
difficult, 
and 
the 
human 
understanding 
may 
the 
more 
willingly 
submit 
to 
its 
purgation 
and 
dismiss 
its 
idols. 


LXII 


Idols 
of 
the 
Theater, 
or 
of 
Systems, 
are 
many, 
and 
there 
can 
be 
and 
perhaps 
will 
be 
yet 
many 
more. 
For 
were 
it 
not 
that 
now 
for 
many 
ages 
men's 
minds 
have 
been 
busied 
with 
religion 
and 
theology; 
and 
were 
it 
not 
that 
civil 
governments, 
especially 
monarchies, 
have 
been 
averse 
to 
such 
novelties, 
even 
in 
matters 
speculative; 
so 
that 
men 
labor 
therein 
to 
the 
peril 
and 
harming 
of 
their 
fortunes 
— 
not 
only 
unrewarded, 
but 
exposed 
also 
to 
contempt 
and 
envy 
— 
doubtless 
there 
would 
have 
arisen 
many 
other 
philosophical 
sects 
like 
those 
which 
in 
great 
variety 
flourished 
once 
among 
the 
Greeks. 
For 
as 
on 
the 
phenomena 
of 
the 
heavens 
many 
hypotheses 
may 
be 
constructed, 
so 
likewise 
(and 
more 
also) 
many 
various 
dogmas 
may 
be 
set 
up 
and 
established 
on 
the 
phenomena 
of 
philosophy. 
And 
in 
the 
plays 
of 
this 
philosophical 
theater 
you 
may 
observe 
the 
same 
thing 
which 
is 
found 
in 
the 
theater 
of 
the 
poets, 
that 
stories 
invented 
for 
the 
stage 
are 
more 
compact 
and 
elegant, 
and 
more 
as 
one 
would 
wish 
them 
to 
be, 
than 
true 
stories 
out 
of 
history. 


In 
general, 
however, 
there 
is 
taken 
for 
the 
material 
of 
philosophy 
either 
a 
great 
deal 
out 
of 
a 
few 
things, 
or 
a 
very 
little 
out 
of 
many 
things; 
so 
that 
on 
both 
sides 
philosophy 
is 
based 
on 
too 
narrow 
a 
foundation 
of 
experiment 
and 
natural 
history, 
and 
decides 
on 
the 
authority 
of 
too 
few 
cases. 
For 
the 
Rational 
School 
of 
philosophers 
snatches 
from 
experience 
a 
variety 
of 
common 
instances, 
neither 
duly 
ascertained 
nor 
diligently 
examined 
and 
weighed, 
and 
leaves 
all 
the 
rest 
to 
meditation 
and 
agitation 
of 
wit. 



There 
is 
also 
another 
class 
of 
philosophers 
who, 
having 
bestowed 
much 
diligent 
and 
careful 
labor 
on 
a 
few 
experiments, 
have 
thence 
made 
bold 
to 
educe 
and 
construct 
systems, 
wresting 
all 
other 
facts 
in 
a 
strange 
fashion 
to 
conformity 
therewith. 


And 
there 
is 
yet 
a 
third 
class, 
consisting 
of 
those 
who 
out 
of 
faith 
and 
veneration 
mix 
their 
philosophy 
with 
theology 
and 
traditions; 
among 
whom 
the 
vanity 
of 
some 
has 
gone 
so 
far 
aside 
as 
to 
seek 
the 
origin 
of 
sciences 
among 
spirits 
and 
genii. 
So 
that 
this 
parent 
stock 
of 
errors 
— 
this 
false 
philosophy 
— 
is 
of 
three 
kinds: 
the 
Sophistical, 
the 
Empirical, 
and 
the 
Superstitious. 


LXIII 


The 
most 
conspicuous 
example 
of 
the 
first 
class 
was 
Aristotle, 
who 
corrupted 
natural 
philosophy 
by 
his 
logic: 
fashioning 
the 
world 
out 
of 
categories; 
assigning 
to 
the 
human 
soul, 
the 
noblest 
of 
substances, 
a 
genus 
from 
words 
of 
the 
second 
intention; 
doing 
the 
business 
of 
density 
and 
rarity 
(which 
is 
to 
make 
bodies 
of 
greater 
or 
less 
dimensions, 
that 
is, 
occupy 
greater 
or 
less 
spaces), 
by 
the 
frigid 
distinction 
of 
act 
and 
power; 
asserting 
that 
single 
bodies 
have 
each 
a 
single 
and 
proper 
motion, 
and 
that 
if 
they 
participate 
in 
any 
other, 
then 
this 
results 
from 
an 
external 
cause; 
and 
imposing 
countless 
other 
arbitrary 
restrictions 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
things; 
being 
always 
more 
solicitous 
to 
provide 
an 
answer 
to 
the 
question 
and 
affirm 
something 
positive 
in 
words, 
than 
about 
the 
inner 
truth 
of 
things; 
a 
failing 
best 
shown 
when 
his 
philosophy 
is 
compared 
with 
other 
systems 
of 
note 
among 
the 
Greeks. 
For 
the 
homoeomera 
of 
Anaxagoras; 
the 
Atoms 
of 
Leucippus 
and 
Democritus; 
the 
Heaven 
and 
Earth 
of 
Parmenides; 
the 
Strife 
and 
Friendship 
of 
Empedocles; 
Heraclitus' 
doctrine 
how 
bodies 
are 
resolved 
into 
the 
indifferent 
nature 
of 
fire, 
and 
remolded 
into 
solids, 
have 
all 
of 
them 
some 
taste 
of 
the 
natural 
philosopher 
— 
some 
savor 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
and 
experience, 
and 
bodies; 
whereas 
in 
the 
physics 
of 
Aristotle 
you 
hear 
hardly 
anything 
but 
the 
words 
of 
logic, 
which 
in 
his 
metaphysics 
also, 
under 
a 
more 
imposing 
name, 
and 
more 
forsooth 
as 
a 
realist 
than 
a 
nominalist, 
he 
has 
handled 
over 
again. 
Nor 
let 
any 
weight 
be 
given 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
his 
books 
on 
animals 
and 
his 
problems, 
and 
other 
of 
his 
treatises, 
there 
is 
frequent 
dealing 
with 
experiments. 
For 
he 
had 
come 
to 
his 
conclusion 
before; 
he 
did 
not 
consult 



experience, 
as 
he 
should 
have 
done, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
framing 
his 
decisions 
and 
axioms, 
but 
having 
first 
determined 
the 
question 
according 
to 
his 
will, 
he 
then 
resorts 
to 
experience, 
and 
bending 
her 
into 
conformity 
with 
his 
placets, 
leads 
her 
about 
like 
a 
captive 
in 
a 
procession. 
So 
that 
even 
on 
this 
count 
he 
is 
more 
guilty 
than 
his 
modern 
followers, 
the 
schoolmen, 
who 
have 
abandoned 
experience 
altogether. 


LXIV 


But 
the 
Empirical 
school 
of 
philosophy 
gives 
birth 
to 
dogmas 
more 
deformed 
and 
monstrous 
than 
the 
Sophistical 
or 
Rational 
school. 
For 
it 
has 
its 
foundations 
not 
in 
the 
light 
of 
common 
notions 
(which 
though 
it 
be 
a 
faint 
and 
superficial 
light, 
is 
yet 
in 
a 
manner 
universal, 
and 
has 
reference 
to 
many 
things), 
but 
in 
the 
narrowness 
and 
darkness 
of 
a 
few 
experiments. 
To 
those 
therefore 
who 
are 
daily 
busied 
with 
these 
experiments 
and 
have 
infected 
their 
imagination 
with 
them, 
such 
a 
philosophy 
seems 
probable 
and 
all 
but 
certain; 
to 
all 
men 
else 
incredible 
and 
vain. 
Of 
this 
there 
is 
a 
notable 
instance 
in 
the 
alchemists 
and 
their 
dogmas, 
though 
it 
is 
hardly 
to 
be 
found 
elsewhere 
in 
these 
times, 
except 
perhaps 
in 
the 
philosophy 
of 
Gilbert. 
Nevertheless, 
with 
regard 
to 
philosophies 
of 
this 
kind 
there 
is 
one 
caution 
not 
to 
be 
omitted; 
for 
I 
foresee 
that 
if 
ever 
men 
are 
roused 
by 
my 
admonitions 
to 
betake 
themselves 
seriously 
to 
experiment 
and 
bid 
farewell 
to 
sophistical 
doctrines, 
then 
indeed 
through 
the 
premature 
hurry 
of 
the 
understanding 
to 
leap 
or 
fly 
to 
universals 
and 
principles 
of 
things, 
great 
danger 
may 
be 
apprehended 
from 
philosophies 
of 
this 
kind, 
against 
which 
evil 
we 
ought 
even 
now 
to 
prepare. 


LXV 


But 
the 
corruption 
of 
philosophy 
by 
superstition 
and 
an 
admixture 
of 
theology 
is 
far 
more 
widely 
spread, 
and 
does 
the 
greatest 
harm, 
whether 
to 
entire 
systems 
or 
to 
their 
parts. 
For 
the 
human 
understanding 
is 
obnoxious 
to 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
imagination 
no 
less 
than 
to 
the 
influence 
of 
common 
notions. 
For 
the 
contentious 
and 
sophistical 
kind 
of 
philosophy 
ensnares 
the 
understanding; 
but 
this 
kind, 
being 
fanciful 
and 
tumid 
and 
half 
poetical, 
misleads 
it 
more 
by 
flattery. 
For 
there 
is 
in 
man 
an 
ambition 
of 
the 
understanding, 
no 
less 
than 
of 
the 
will, 
especially 
in 
high 
and 
lofty 
spirits. 



Of 
this 
kind 
we 
have 
among 
the 
Greeks 
a 
striking 
example 
in 


Pythagoras, 
though 
he 
united 
with 
it 
a 
coarser 
and 
more 
cumbrous 


superstition; 
another 
in 
Plato 
and 
his 
school, 
more 
dangerous 
and 
subtle. 
It 
shows 
itself 
likewise 
in 
parts 
of 
other 
philosophies, 
in 
the 
introduction 
of 
abstract 
forms 
and 
final 
causes 
and 
first 
causes, 
with 
the 
omission 
in 
most 
cases 
of 
causes 
intermediate, 
and 
the 
like. 
Upon 
this 
point 
the 
greatest 
caution 
should 
be 
used. 
For 
nothing 
is 
so 
mischievous 
as 
the 
apotheosis 
of 
error; 
and 
it 
is 
a 
very 
plague 
of 
the 
understanding 
for 
vanity 
to 
become 
the 
object 
of 
veneration. 
Yet 
in 
this 
vanity 
some 
of 
the 
moderns 
have 
with 
extreme 
levity 
indulged 
so 
far 
as 
to 
attempt 
to 
found 
a 
system 
of 
natural 
philosophy 
on 
the 
first 
chapter 
of 
Genesis, 
on 
the 
book 
of 
Job, 
and 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
sacred 
writings, 
seeking 
for 
the 
dead 
among 
the 
living; 
which 
also 
makes 
the 
inhibition 
and 
repression 
of 
it 
the 
more 
important, 
because 
from 
this 
unwholesome 
mixture 
of 
things 
human 
and 
divine 
there 
arises 
not 
only 
a 
fantastic 
philosophy 
but 
also 
a 
heretical 
religion. 
Very 
meet 
it 
is 
therefore 
that 
we 
be 
sober-minded, 
and 
give 
to 
faith 
that 
only 
which 
is 
faith's. 


LXVI 


So 
much, 
then, 
for 
the 
mischievous 
authorities 
of 
systems, 
which 
are 
founded 
either 
on 
common 
notions, 
or 
on 
a 
few 
experiments, 
or 
on 
superstition. 
It 
remains 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
faulty 
subject 
matter 
of 
contemplations, 
especially 
in 
natural 
philosophy. 
Now 
the 
human 
understanding 
is 
infected 
by 
the 
sight 
of 
what 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
mechanical 
arts, 
in 
which 
the 
alteration 
of 
bodies 
proceeds 
chiefly 
by 
composition 
or 
separation, 
and 
so 
imagines 
that 
something 
similar 
goes 
on 
in 
the 
universal 
nature 
of 
things. 
From 
this 
source 
has 
flowed 
the 
fiction 
of 
elements, 
and 
of 
their 
concourse 
for 
the 
formation 
of 
natural 
bodies. 
Again, 
when 
man 
contemplates 
nature 
working 
freely, 
he 
meets 
with 
different 
species 
of 
things, 
of 
animals, 
of 
plants, 
of 
minerals; 
whence 
he 
readily 
passes 
into 
the 
opinion 
that 
there 
are 
in 
nature 
certain 
primary 
forms 
which 
nature 
intends 
to 
educe, 
and 
that 
the 
remaining 
variety 
proceeds 
from 
hindrances 
and 
aberrations 
of 
nature 
in 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
her 
work, 
or 
from 
the 
collision 
of 
different 
species 
and 
the 
transplanting 
of 
one 
into 
another. 
To 
the 
first 
of 
these 
speculations 
we 
owe 
our 
primary 
qualities 
of 
the 
elements; 
to 
the 
other 
our 
occult 
properties 
and 
specific 
virtues; 
and 
both 
of 
them 
belong 
to 
those 
empty 
compendia 
of 
thought 
wherein 
the 
mind 
rests, 
and 
whereby 
it 
is 
diverted 
from 
more 
solid 



pursuits. 
It 
is 
to 
better 
purpose 
that 
the 
physicians 
bestow 
their 
labor 
on 
the 
secondary 
qualities 
of 
matter, 
and 
the 
operations 
of 
attraction, 
repulsion, 
attenuation, 
conspissation,1 
dilatation, 
astriction, 
dissipation, 
maturation, 
and 
the 
like; 
and 
were 
it 
not 
that 
by 
those 
two 
compendia 
which 
I 
have 
mentioned 
(elementary 
qualities, 
to 
wit, 
and 
specific 
virtues) 
they 
corrupted 
their 
correct 
observations 
in 
these 
other 
matters 
— 
either 
reducing 
them 
to 
first 
qualities 
and 
their 
subtle 
and 
incommensurable 
mixtures, 
or 
not 
following 
them 
out 
with 
greater 
and 
more 
diligent 
observations 
to 
third 
and 
fourth 
qualities, 
but 
breaking 
off 
the 
scrutiny 
prematurely 
— 
they 
would 
have 
made 
much 
greater 
progress. 
Nor 
are 
powers 
of 
this 
kind 
(I 
do 
not 
say 
the 
same, 
but 
similar) 
to 
be 
sought 
for 
only 
in 
the 
medicines 
of 
the 
human 
body, 
but 
also 
in 
the 
changes 
of 
all 
other 
bodies. 


But 
it 
is 
a 
far 
greater 
evil 
that 
they 
make 
the 
quiescent 
principles, 
wherefrom 
, 
and 
not 
the 
moving 
principles, 
whereby 
, 
things 
are 
produced, 
the 
object 
of 
their 
contemplation 
and 
inquiry. 
For 
the 
former 
tend 
to 
discourse, 
the 
latter 
to 
works. 
Nor 
is 
there 
any 
value 
in 
those 
vulgar 
distinctions 
of 
motion 
which 
are 
observed 
in 
the 
received 
system 
of 
natural 
philosophy, 
as 
generation, 
corruption, 
augmentation, 
diminution, 
alteration, 
and 
local 
motion. 
What 
they 
mean 
no 
doubt 
is 
this: 
if 
a 
body 
in 
other 
respects 
not 
changed 
be 
moved 
from 
its 
place, 
this 
is 
local 
motion 
; 
if 
without 
change 
of 
place 
or 
essence, 
it 
be 
changed 
in 
quality, 
this 
is 
alteration 
; 
if 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
change 
the 
mass 
and 
quantity 
of 
the 
body 
do 
not 
remain 
the 
same, 
this 
is 
augmentation 
or 
diminution 
; 
if 
they 
be 
changed 
to 
such 
a 
degree 
that 
they 
change 
their 
very 
essence 
and 
substance 
and 
turn 
to 
something 
else, 
this 
is 
generation 
and 
corruption 
. 
But 
all 
this 
is 
merely 
popular, 
and 
does 
not 
at 
all 
go 
deep 
into 
nature; 
for 
these 
are 
only 
measures 
and 
limits, 
not 
kinds 
of 
motion. 
What 
they 
intimate 
is 
how 
far 
, 
not 
by 
what 
means 
, 
or 
from 
what 
source 
. 
For 
they 
do 
not 
suggest 
anything 
with 
regard 
either 
to 
the 
desires 
of 
bodies 
or 
to 
the 
development 
of 
their 
parts. 
It 
is 
only 
when 
that 
motion 
presents 
the 
thing 
grossly 
and 
palpably 
to 
the 
sense 
as 
different 
from 
what 
it 
was 
that 
they 
begin 
to 
mark 
the 
division. 
Even 
when 
they 
wish 
to 
suggest 
something 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
causes 
of 
motion, 
and 
to 
establish 
a 
division 
with 
reference 
to 
them, 
they 
introduce 
with 
the 
greatest 
negligence 
a 
distinction 
between 
motion 
natural 
and 
violent, 
a 
distinction 
which 
is 
itself 
drawn 
entirely 
from 
a 
vulgar 
notion, 
since 
all 
violent 
motion 
is 
also 
in 
fact 
natural; 
the 
external 
efficient 
simply 
setting 
nature 
working 
otherwise 
than 
it 
was 
before. 
But 
if, 
leaving 
all 
this, 
anyone 
shall 
observe 
(for 
instance) 
that 



there 
is 
in 
bodies 
a 
desire 
of 
mutual 
contact, 
so 
as 
not 
to 
suffer 
the 
unity 
of 
nature 
to 
be 
quite 
separated 
or 
broken 
and 
a 
vacuum 
thus 
made; 
or 
if 
anyone 
say 
that 
there 
is 
in 
bodies 
a 
desire 
of 
resuming 
their 
natural 
dimensions 
or 
tension, 
so 
that 
if 
compressed 
within 
or 
extended 
beyond 
them, 
they 
immediately 
strive 
to 
recover 
themselves, 
and 
fall 
back 
to 
their 
old 
volume 
and 
extent; 
or 
if 
anyone 
say 
that 
there 
is 
in 
bodies 
a 
desire 
of 
congregating 
toward 
masses 
of 
kindred 
nature 
— 
of 
dense 
bodies, 
for 
instance, 
toward 
the 
globe 
of 
the 
earth, 
of 
thin 
and 
rare 
bodies 
toward 
the 
compass 
of 
the 
sky; 
all 
these 
and 
the 
like 
are 
truly 
physical 
kinds 
of 
motion 
— 
but 
those 
others 
are 
entirely 
logical 
and 
scholastic, 
as 
is 
abundantly 
manifest 
from 
this 
comparison. 


Nor 
again 
is 
it 
a 
lesser 
evil 
that 
in 
their 
philosophies 
and 
contemplations 
their 
labor 
is 
spent 
in 
investigating 
and 
handling 
the 
first 
principles 
of 
things 
and 
the 
highest 
generalities 
of 
nature; 
whereas 
utility 
and 
the 
means 
of 
working 
result 
entirely 
from 
things 
intermediate. 
Hence 
it 
is 
that 
men 
cease 
not 
from 
abstracting 
nature 
till 
they 
come 
to 
potential 
and 
uninformed 
matter, 
nor 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
from 
dissecting 
nature 
till 
they 
reach 
the 
atom; 
things 
which, 
even 
if 
true, 
can 
do 
but 
little 
for 
the 
welfare 
of 
mankind. 


1[Conspissatio.

LXVII 


A 
caution 
must 
also 
be 
given 
to 
the 
understanding 
against 
the 
intemperance 
which 
systems 
of 
philosophy 
manifest 
in 
giving 
or 
withholding 
assent, 
because 
intemperance 
of 
this 
kind 
seems 
to 
establish 
idols 
and 
in 
some 
sort 
to 
perpetuate 
them, 
leaving 
no 
way 
open 
to 
reach 
and 
dislodge 
them. 


This 
excess 
is 
of 
two 
kinds: 
the 
first 
being 
manifest 
in 
those 
who 
are 
ready 
in 
deciding, 
and 
render 
sciences 
dogmatic 
and 
magisterial; 
the 
other 
in 
those 
who 
deny 
that 
we 
can 
know 
anything, 
and 
so 
introduce 
a 
wandering 
kind 
of 
inquiry 
that 
leads 
to 
nothing; 
of 
which 
kinds 
the 
former 
subdues, 
the 
latter 
weakens 
the 
understanding. 
For 
the 
philosophy 
of 
Aristotle, 
after 
having 
by 
hostile 
confutations 
destroyed 
all 
the 
rest 
(as 
the 
Ottomans 
serve 
their 
brothers), 
has 
laid 
down 
the 
law 
on 
all 
points; 
which 
done, 
he 
proceeds 



himself 
to 
raise 
new 
questions 
of 
his 
own 
suggestion, 
and 
dispose 
of 
them 
likewise, 
so 
that 
nothing 
may 
remain 
that 
is 
not 
certain 
and 
decided; 
a 
practice 
which 
holds 
and 
is 
in 
use 
among 
his 
successors. 


The 
school 
of 
Plato, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
introduced 
Acatalepsia 
, 
at 
first 
in 
jest 
and 
irony, 
and 
in 
disdain 
of 
the 
older 
sophists, 
Protagoras, 
Hippias, 
and 
the 
rest, 
who 
were 
of 
nothing 
else 
so 
much 
ashamed 
as 
of 
seeming 
to 
doubt 
about 
anything. 
But 
the 
New 
Academy 
made 
a 
dogma 
of 
it, 
and 
held 
it 
as 
a 
tenet. 
And 
though 
theirs 
is 
a 
fairer 
seeming 
way 
than 
arbitrary 
decisions, 
since 
they 
say 
that 
they 
by 
no 
means 
destroy 
all 
investigation, 
like 
Pyrrho 
and 
his 
Refrainers, 
but 
allow 
of 
some 
things 
to 
be 
followed 
as 
probable, 
though 
of 
none 
to 
be 
maintained 
as 
true; 
yet 
still 
when 
the 
human 
mind 
has 
once 
despaired 
of 
finding 
truth, 
its 
interest 
in 
all 
things 
grows 
fainter, 
and 
the 
result 
is 
that 
men 
turn 
aside 
to 
pleasant 
disputations 
and 
discourses 
and 
roam 
as 
it 
were 
from 
object 
to 
object, 
rather 
than 
keep 
on 
a 
course 
of 
severe 
inquisition. 
But, 
as 
I 
said 
at 
the 
beginning 
and 
am 
ever 
urging, 
the 
human 
senses 
and 
understanding, 
weak 
as 
they 
are, 
are 
not 
to 
be 
deprived 
of 
their 
authority, 
but 
to 
be 
supplied 
with 
helps. 


LXVIII 


So 
much 
concerning 
the 
several 
classes 
of 
Idols 
and 
their 
equipage; 
all 
of 
which 
must 
be 
renounced 
and 
put 
away 
with 
a 
fixed 
and 
solemn 
determination, 
and 
the 
understanding 
thoroughly 
freed 
and 
cleansed; 
the 
entrance 
into 
the 
kingdom 
of 
man, 
founded 
on 
the 
sciences, 
being 
not 
much 
other 
than 
the 
entrance 
into 
the 
kingdom 
of 
heaven, 
whereinto 
none 
may 
enter 
except 
as 
a 
little 
child. 


LXIX 


But 
vicious 
demonstrations 
are 
as 
the 
strongholds 
and 
defenses 
of 
idols; 
and 
those 
we 
have 
in 
logic 
do 
little 
else 
than 
make 
the 
world 
the 
bondslave 
of 
human 
thought, 
and 
human 
thought 
the 
bondslave 
of 
words. 
Demonstrations 
truly 
are 
in 
effect 
the 
philosophies 
themselves 
and 
the 
sciences. 
For 
such 
as 
they 
are, 
well 
or 
ill 
established, 
such 
are 
the 
systems 
of 
philosophy 
and 
the 
contemplations 
which 
follow. 
Now 
in 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
process 
which 
leads 
from 
the 
sense 
and 
objects 
to 
axioms 
and 
conclusions, 



the 
demonstrations 
which 
we 
use 
are 
deceptive 
and 
incompetent. 
This 
process 
consists 
of 
four 
parts, 
and 
has 
as 
many 
faults. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
the 
impressions 
of 
the 
sense 
itself 
are 
faulty; 
for 
the 
sense 
both 
fails 
us 
and 
deceives 
us. 
But 
its 
shortcomings 
are 
to 
be 
supplied, 
and 
its 
deceptions 
to 
be 
corrected. 
Secondly, 
notions 
are 
ill-drawn 
from 
the 
impressions 
of 
the 
senses, 
and 
are 
indefinite 
and 
confused, 
whereas 
they 
should 
be 
definite 
and 
distinctly 
bounded. 
Thirdly, 
the 
induction 
is 
amiss 
which 
infers 
the 
principles 
of 
sciences 
by 
simple 
enumeration, 
and 
does 
not, 
as 
it 
ought, 
employ 
exclusions 
and 
solutions 
(or 
separations) 
of 
nature. 
Lastly, 
that 
method 
of 
discovery 
and 
proof 
according 
to 
which 
the 
most 
general 
principles 
are 
first 
established, 
and 
then 
intermediate 
axioms 
are 
tried 
and 
proved 
by 
them, 
is 
the 
parent 
of 
error 
and 
the 
curse 
of 
all 
science. 
Of 
these 
things, 
however, 
which 
now 
I 
do 
but 
touch 
upon, 
I 
will 
speak 
more 
largely 
when, 
having 
performed 
these 
expiations 
and 
purgings 
of 
the 
mind, 
I 
come 
to 
set 
forth 
the 
true 
way 
for 
the 
interpretation 
of 
nature. 


LXX 


But 
the 
best 
demonstration 
by 
far 
is 
experience, 
if 
it 
go 
not 
beyond 
the 
actual 
experiment. 
For 
if 
it 
be 
transferred 
to 
other 
cases 
which 
are 
deemed 
similar, 
unless 
such 
transfer 
be 
made 
by 
a 
just 
and 
orderly 
process, 
it 
is 
a 
fallacious 
thing. 
But 
the 
manner 
of 
making 
experiments 
which 
men 
now 
use 
is 
blind 
and 
stupid. 
And 
therefore, 
wandering 
and 
straying 
as 
they 
do 
with 
no 
settled 
course, 
and 
taking 
counsel 
only 
from 
things 
as 
they 
fall 
out, 
they 
fetch 
a 
wide 
circuit 
and 
meet 
with 
many 
matters, 
but 
make 
little 
progress; 
and 
sometimes 
are 
full 
of 
hope, 
sometimes 
are 
distracted; 
and 
always 
find 
that 
there 
is 
something 
beyond 
to 
be 
sought. 
For 
it 
generally 
happens 
that 
men 
make 
their 
trials 
carelessly, 
and 
as 
it 
were 
in 
play; 
slightly 
varying 
experiments 
already 
known, 
and, 
if 
the 
thing 
does 
not 
answer, 
growing 
weary 
and 
abandoning 
the 
attempt. 
And 
even 
if 
they 
apply 
themselves 
to 
experiments 
more 
seriously 
and 
earnestly 
and 
laboriously, 
still 
they 
spend 
their 
labor 
in 
working 
out 
some 
one 
experiment, 
as 
Gilbert 
with 
the 
magnet, 
and 
the 
chemists 
with 
gold; 
a 
course 
of 
proceeding 
not 
less 
unskillful 
in 
the 
design 
than 
small 
in 
the 
attempt. 
For 
no 
one 
successfully 
investigates 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
thing 
in 
the 
thing 
itself; 
the 
inquiry 
must 
be 
enlarged 
so 
as 
to 
become 
more 
general. 



And 
even 
when 
they 
seek 
to 
educe 
some 
science 
or 
theory 
from 
their 
experiments, 
they 
nevertheless 
almost 
always 
turn 
aside 
with 
overhasty 
and 
unseasonable 
eagerness 
to 
practice; 
not 
only 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
the 
uses 
and 
fruits 
of 
the 
practice, 
but 
from 
impatience 
to 
obtain 
in 
the 
shape 
of 
some 
new 
work 
an 
assurance 
for 
themselves 
that 
it 
is 
worth 
their 
while 
to 
go 
on; 
and 
also 
to 
show 
themselves 
off 
to 
the 
world, 
and 
so 
raise 
the 
credit 
of 
the 
business 
in 
which 
they 
are 
engaged. 
Thus, 
like 
Atalanta, 
they 
go 
aside 
to 
pick 
up 
the 
golden 
apple, 
but 
meanwhile 
they 
interrupt 
their 
course, 
and 
let 
the 
victory 
escape 
them. 
But 
in 
the 
true 
course 
of 
experience, 
and 
in 
carrying 
it 
on 
to 
the 
effecting 
of 
new 
works, 
the 
divine 
wisdom 
and 
order 
must 
be 
our 
pattern. 
Now 
God 
on 
the 
first 
day 
of 
creation 
created 
light 
only, 
giving 
to 
that 
work 
an 
entire 
day, 
in 
which 
no 
material 
substance 
was 
created. 
So 
must 
we 
likewise 
from 
experience 
of 
every 
kind 
first 
endeavor 
to 
discover 
true 
causes 
and 
axioms; 
and 
seek 
for 
experiments 
of 
Light, 
not 
for 
experiments 
of 
Fruit. 
For 
axioms 
rightly 
discovered 
and 
established 
supply 
practice 
with 
its 
instruments, 
not 
one 
by 
one, 
but 
in 
clusters, 
and 
draw 
after 
them 
trains 
and 
troops 
of 
works. 
Of 
the 
paths, 
however, 
of 
experience, 
which 
no 
less 
than 
the 
paths 
of 
judgment 
are 
impeded 
and 
beset, 
I 
will 
speak 
hereafter; 
here 
I 
have 
only 
mentioned 
ordinary 
experimental 
research 
as 
a 
bad 
kind 
of 
demonstration. 
But 
now 
the 
order 
of 
the 
matter 
in 
hand 
leads 
me 
to 
add 
something 
both 
as 
to 
those 
signs 
which 
I 
lately 
mentioned 
(signs 
that 
the 
systems 
of 
philosophy 
and 
contemplation 
in 
use 
are 
in 
a 
bad 
condition), 
and 
also 
as 
to 
the 
causes 
of 
what 
seems 
at 
first 
so 
strange 
and 
incredible. 
For 
a 
knowledge 
of 
the 
signs 
prepares 
assent; 
an 
explanation 
of 
the 
causes 
removes 
the 
marvel 
— 
which 
two 
things 
will 
do 
much 
to 
render 
the 
extirpation 
of 
idols 
from 
the 
understanding 
more 
easy 
and 
gentle. 


LXXI 


The 
sciences 
which 
we 
possess 
come 
for 
the 
most 
part 
from 
the 
Greeks. 
For 
what 
has 
been 
added 
by 
Roman, 
Arabic, 
or 
later 
writers 
is 
not 
much 
nor 
of 
much 
importance; 
and 
whatever 
it 
is, 
it 
is 
built 
on 
the 
foundation 
of 
Greek 
discoveries. 
Now 
the 
wisdom 
of 
the 
Greeks 
was 
professorial 
and 
much 
given 
to 
disputations, 
a 
kind 
of 
wisdom 
most 
adverse 
to 
the 
inquisition 
of 
truth. 
Thus 
that 
name 
of 
Sophists, 
which 
by 
those 
who 
would 
be 
thought 
philosophers 
was 
in 
contempt 
cast 
back 
upon 
and 
so 
transferred 
to 
the 
ancient 
rhetoricians, 
Gorgias, 
Protagoras, 
Hippias, 
Polus, 
does 
indeed 
suit 
the 
entire 



class: 
Plato, 
Aristotle, 
Zeno, 
Epicurus, 
Theophrastus, 
and 
their 
successors 
Chrysippus, 
Carneades, 
and 
the 
rest. 
There 
was 
this 
difference 
only, 
that 
the 
former 
class 
was 
wandering 
and 
mercenary, 
going 
about 
from 
town 
to 
town, 
putting 
up 
their 
wisdom 
to 
sale, 
and 
taking 
a 
price 
for 
it, 
while 
the 
latter 
was 
more 
pompous 
and 
dignified, 
as 
composed 
of 
men 
who 
had 
fixed 
abodes, 
and 
who 
opened 
schools 
and 
taught 
their 
philosophy 
without 
reward. 
Still 
both 
sorts, 
though 
in 
other 
respects 
unequal, 
were 
professorial; 
both 
turned 
the 
matter 
into 
disputations, 
and 
set 
up 
and 
battled 
for 
philosophical 
sects 
and 
heresies; 
so 
that 
their 
doctrines 
were 
for 
the 
most 
part 
(as 
Dionysius 
not 
unaptly 
rallied 
Plato) 
"the 
talk 
of 
idle 
old 
men 
to 
ignorant 
youths." 
But 
the 
elder 
of 
the 
Greek 
philosophers, 
Empedocles, 
Anaxagoras, 
Leucippus, 
Democritus, 
Parmenides, 
Heraclitus, 
Xenophanes, 
Philolaus, 
and 
the 
rest 
(I 
omit 
Pythagoras 
as 
a 
mystic), 
did 
not, 
so 
far 
as 
we 
know, 
open 
schools; 
but 
more 
silently 
and 
severely 
and 
simply 
— 
that 
is, 
with 
less 
affectation 
and 
parade 
— 
betook 
themselves 
to 
the 
inquisition 
of 
truth. 
And 
therefore 
they 
were 
in 
my 
judgment 
more 
successful; 
only 
that 
their 
works 
were 
in 
the 
course 
of 
time 
obscured 
by 
those 
slighter 
persons 
who 
had 
more 
which 
suits 
and 
pleases 
the 
capacity 
and 
tastes 
of 
the 
vulgar; 
time, 
like 
a 
river, 
bringing 
down 
to 
us 
things 
which 
are 
light 
and 
puffed 
up, 
but 
letting 
weighty 
matters 
sink. 
Still 
even 
they 
were 
not 
altogether 
free 
from 
the 
failing 
of 
their 
nation, 
but 
leaned 
too 
much 
to 
the 
ambition 
and 
vanity 
of 
founding 
a 
sect 
and 
catching 
popular 
applause. 
But 
the 
inquisition 
of 
truth 
must 
be 
despaired 
of 
when 
it 
turns 
aside 
to 
trifles 
of 
this 
kind. 
Nor 
should 
we 
omit 
that 
judgment, 
or 
rather 
divination, 
which 
was 
given 
concerning 
the 
Greeks 
by 
the 
Egyptian 
priest 
— 
that 
"they 
were 
always 
boys, 
without 
antiquity 
of 
knowledge 
or 
knowledge 
of 
antiquity." 
Assuredly 
they 
have 
that 
which 
is 
characteristic 
of 
boys: 
they 
are 
prompt 
to 
prattle, 
but 
cannot 
generate; 
for 
their 
wisdom 
abounds 
in 
words 
but 
is 
barren 
of 
works. 
And 
therefore 
the 
signs 
which 
are 
taken 
from 
the 
origin 
and 
birthplace 
of 
the 
received 
philosophy 
are 
not 
good. 


LXXII 


Nor 
does 
the 
character 
of 
the 
time 
and 
age 
yield 
much 
better 
signs 
than 
the 
character 
of 
the 
country 
and 
nation. 
For 
at 
that 
period 
there 
was 
but 
a 
narrow 
and 
meager 
knowledge 
either 
of 
time 
or 
place, 
which 
is 
the 
worst 
thing 
that 
can 
be, 
especially 
for 
those 
who 
rest 
all 
on 
experience. 
For 
they 
had 
no 
history 
worthy 
to 
be 
called 
history 
that 
went 
back 
a 
thousand 
years 
— 



but 
only 
fables 
and 
rumors 
of 
antiquity. 
And 
of 
the 
regions 
and 
districts 
of 
the 
world 
they 
knew 
but 
a 
small 
portion, 
giving 
indiscriminately 
the 
name 
of 
Scythians 
to 
all 
in 
the 
North, 
of 
Celts 
to 
all 
in 
the 
West; 
knowing 
nothing 
of 
Africa 
beyond 
the 
hither 
side 
of 
Ethiopia, 
of 
Asia 
beyond 
the 
Ganges. 
Much 
less 
were 
they 
acquainted 
with 
the 
provinces 
of 
the 
New 
World, 
even 
by 
hearsay 
or 
any 
well-founded 
rumor; 
nay, 
a 
multitude 
of 
climates 
and 
zones, 
wherein 
innumerable 
nations 
breathe 
and 
live, 
were 
pronounced 
by 
them 
to 
be 
uninhabitable; 
and 
the 
travels 
of 
Democritus, 
Plato, 
and 
Pythagoras, 
which 
were 
rather 
suburban 
excursions 
than 
distant 
journeys, 
were 
talked 
of 
as 
something 
great. 
In 
our 
times, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
both 
many 
parts 
of 
the 
New 
World 
and 
the 
limits 
on 
every 
side 
of 
the 
Old 
World 
are 
known, 
and 
our 
stock 
of 
experience 
has 
increased 
to 
an 
infinite 
amount. 
Wherefore 
if 
(like 
astrologers) 
we 
draw 
signs 
from 
the 
season 
of 
their 
nativity 
or 
birth, 
nothing 
great 
can 
be 
predicted 
of 
those 
systems 
of 
philosophy. 


LXXIII 


Of 
all 
signs 
there 
is 
none 
more 
certain 
or 
more 
noble 
than 
that 
taken 
from 
fruits. 
For 
fruits 
and 
works 
are 
as 
it 
were 
sponsors 
and 
sureties 
for 
the 
truth 
of 
philosophies. 
Now, 
from 
all 
these 
systems 
of 
the 
Greeks, 
and 
their 
ramifications 
through 
particular 
sciences, 
there 
can 
hardly 
after 
the 
lapse 
of 
so 
many 
years 
be 
adduced 
a 
single 
experiment 
which 
tends 
to 
relieve 
and 
benefit 
the 
condition 
of 
man, 
and 
which 
can 
with 
truth 
be 
referred 
to 
the 
speculations 
and 
theories 
of 
philosophy. 
And 
Celsus 
ingenuously 
and 
wisely 
owns 
as 
much 
when 
he 
tells 
us 
that 
the 
experimental 
part 
of 
medicine 
was 
first 
discovered, 
and 
that 
afterwards 
men 
philosophized 
about 
it, 
and 
hunted 
for 
and 
assigned 
causes; 
and 
not 
by 
an 
inverse 
process 
that 
philosophy 
and 
the 
knowledge 
of 
causes 
led 
to 
the 
discovery 
and 
development 
of 
the 
experimental 
part. 
And 
therefore 
it 
was 
not 
strange 
that 
among 
the 
Egyptians, 
who 
rewarded 
inventors 
with 
divine 
honors 
and 
sacred 
rites, 
there 
were 
more 
images 
of 
brutes 
than 
of 
men; 
inasmuch 
as 
brutes 
by 
their 
natural 
instinct 
have 
produced 
many 
discoveries, 
whereas 
men 
by 
discussion 
and 
the 
conclusions 
of 
reason 
have 
given 
birth 
to 
few 
or 
none. 


Some 
little 
has 
indeed 
been 
produced 
by 
the 
industry 
of 
chemists; 
but 
it 
has 
been 
produced 
accidentally 
and 
in 
passing, 
or 
else 
by 
a 
kind 
of 
variation 
of 
experiments, 
such 
as 
mechanics 
use, 
and 
not 
by 
any 
art 
or 
theory. 



For 
the 
theory 
which 
they 
have 
devised 
rather 
confuses 
the 
experiments 
than 
aids 
them. 
They, 
too, 
who 
have 
busied 
themselves 
with 
natural 
magic, 
as 
they 
call 
it, 
have 
but 
few 
discoveries 
to 
show, 
and 
those 
trifling 
and 
imposture-
like. 
Wherefore, 
as 
in 
religion 
we 
are 
warned 
to 
show 
our 
faith 
by 
works, 
so 
in 
philosophy 
by 
the 
same 
rule 
the 
system 
should 
be 
judged 
of 
by 
its 
fruits, 
and 
pronounced 
frivolous 
if 
it 
be 
barren, 
more 
especially 
if, 
in 
place 
of 
fruits 
of 
grape 
and 
olive, 
it 
bear 
thorns 
and 
briers 
of 
dispute 
and 
contention. 


LXXIV 


Signs 
also 
are 
to 
be 
drawn 
from 
the 
increase 
and 
progress 
of 
systems 
and 
sciences. 
For 
what 
is 
founded 
on 
nature 
grows 
and 
increases, 
while 
what 
is 
founded 
on 
opinion 
varies 
but 
increases 
not. 
If 
therefore 
those 
doctrines 
had 
not 
plainly 
been 
like 
a 
plant 
torn 
up 
from 
its 
roots, 
but 
had 
remained 
attached 
to 
the 
womb 
of 
nature 
and 
continued 
to 
draw 
nourishment 
from 
her, 
that 
could 
never 
have 
come 
to 
pass 
which 
we 
have 
seen 
now 
for 
twice 
a 
thousand 
years; 
namely, 
that 
the 
sciences 
stand 
where 
they 
did 
and 
remain 
almost 
in 
the 
same 
condition, 
receiving 
no 
noticeable 
increase, 
but 
on 
the 
contrary, 
thriving 
most 
under 
their 
first 
founder, 
and 
then 
declining. 
Whereas 
in 
the 
mechanical 
arts, 
which 
are 
founded 
on 
nature 
and 
the 
light 
of 
experience, 
we 
see 
the 
contrary 
happen, 
for 
these 
(as 
long 
as 
they 
are 
popular) 
are 
continually 
thriving 
and 
growing, 
as 
having 
in 
them 
a 
breath 
of 
life, 
at 
the 
first 
rude, 
then 
convenient, 
afterwards 
adorned, 
and 
at 
all 
times 
advancing. 


LXXV 


There 
is 
still 
another 
sign 
remaining 
(if 
sign 
it 
can 
be 
called, 
when 
it 
is 
rather 
testimony, 
nay, 
of 
all 
testimony 
the 
most 
valid). 
I 
mean 
the 
confession 
of 
the 
very 
authorities 
whom 
men 
now 
follow. 
For 
even 
they 
who 
lay 
down 
the 
law 
on 
all 
things 
so 
confidently, 
do 
still 
in 
their 
more 
sober 
moods 
fall 
to 
complaints 
of 
the 
subtlety 
of 
nature, 
the 
obscurity 
of 
things, 
and 
the 
weakness 
of 
the 
human 
mind. 
Now 
if 
this 
were 
all 
they 
did, 
some 
perhaps 
of 
a 
timid 
disposition 
might 
be 
deterred 
from 
further 
search, 
while 
others 
of 
a 
more 
ardent 
and 
hopeful 
spirit 
might 
be 
whetted 
and 
incited 
to 
go 
on 
farther. 
But 
not 
content 
to 
speak 
for 
themselves, 
whatever 
is 
beyond 
their 
own 
or 



their 
master's 
knowledge 
or 
reach 
they 
set 
down 
as 
beyond 
the 
bounds 
of 
possibility, 
and 
pronounce, 
as 
if 
on 
the 
authority 
of 
their 
art, 
that 
it 
cannot 
be 
known 
or 
done; 
thus 
most 
presumptuously 
and 
invidiously 
turning 
the 
weakness 
of 
their 
own 
discoveries 
into 
a 
calumny 
of 
nature 
herself, 
and 
the 
despair 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
world. 
Hence 
the 
school 
of 
the 
New 
Academy, 
which 
held 
Acatalepsia 
as 
a 
tenet 
and 
doomed 
men 
to 
perpetual 
darkness. 
Hence 
the 
opinion 
that 
forms 
or 
true 
differences 
of 
things 
(which 
are 
in 
fact 
laws 
of 
pure 
act) 
are 
past 
finding 
out 
and 
beyond 
the 
reach 
of 
man. 
Hence, 
too, 
those 
opinions 
in 
the 
department 
of 
action 
and 
operation; 
as, 
that 
the 
heat 
of 
the 
sun 
and 
of 
fire 
are 
quite 
different 
in 
kind 
— 
lest 
men 
should 
imagine 
that 
by 
the 
operations 
of 
fire 
anything 
like 
the 
works 
of 
nature 
can 
be 
educed 
and 
formed. 
Hence 
the 
notion 
that 
composition 
only 
is 
the 
work 
of 
man, 
and 
mixture 
of 
none 
but 
nature 
— 
lest 
men 
should 
expect 
from 
art 
some 
power 
of 
generating 
or 
transforming 
natural 
bodies. 
By 
this 
sign, 
therefore, 
men 
will 
easily 
take 
warning 
not 
to 
mix 
up 
their 
fortunes 
and 
labors 
with 
dogmas 
not 
only 
despaired 
of 
but 
dedicated 
to 
despair. 


LXXVI 


Neither 
is 
this 
other 
sign 
to 
be 
omitted: 
that 
formerly 
there 
existed 
among 
philosophers 
such 
great 
disagreement, 
and 
such 
diversities 
in 
the 
schools 
themselves, 
a 
fact 
which 
sufficiently 
shows 
that 
the 
road 
from 
the 
senses 
to 
the 
understanding 
was 
not 
skillfully 
laid 
out, 
when 
the 
same 
groundwork 
of 
philosophy 
(the 
nature 
of 
things 
to 
wit) 
was 
torn 
and 
split 
up 
into 
such 
vague 
and 
multifarious 
errors. 
And 
although 
in 
these 
times 
disagreements 
and 
diversities 
of 
opinion 
on 
first 
principles 
and 
entire 
systems 
are 
for 
the 
most 
part 
extinguished, 
still 
on 
parts 
of 
philosophy 
there 
remain 
innumerable 
questions 
and 
disputes, 
so 
that 
it 
plainly 
appears 
that 
neither 
in 
the 
systems 
themselves 
nor 
in 
the 
modes 
of 
demonstration 
is 
there 
anything 
certain 
or 
sound. 


LXXVII 


And 
as 
for 
the 
general 
opinion 
that 
in 
the 
philosophy 
of 
Aristotle, 
at 
any 
rate, 
there 
is 
great 
agreement, 
since 
after 
its 
publication 
the 
systems 
of 
older 
philosophers 
died 
away, 
while 
in 
the 
times 
which 
followed 
nothing 



better 
was 
found, 
so 
that 
it 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
so 
well 
laid 
and 
established 
as 
to 
have 
drawn 
both 
ages 
in 
its 
train 
— 
I 
answer 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
that 
the 
common 
notion 
of 
the 
falling 
off 
of 
the 
old 
systems 
upon 
the 
publication 
of 
Aristotle's 
works 
is 
a 
false 
one; 
for 
long 
afterwards, 
down 
even 
to 
the 
times 
of 
Cicero 
and 
subsequent 
ages, 
the 
works 
of 
the 
old 
philosophers 
still 
remained. 
But 
in 
the 
times 
which 
followed, 
when 
on 
the 
inundation 
of 
barbarians 
into 
the 
Roman 
empire 
human 
learning 
had 
suffered 
shipwreck, 
then 
the 
systems 
of 
Aristotle 
and 
Plato, 
like 
planks 
of 
lighter 
and 
less 
solid 
material, 
floated 
on 
the 
waves 
of 
time 
and 
were 
preserved. 
Upon 
the 
point 
of 
consent 
also 
men 
are 
deceived, 
if 
the 
matter 
be 
looked 
into 
more 
keenly. 
For 
true 
consent 
is 
that 
which 
consists 
in 
the 
coincidence 
of 
free 
judgments, 
after 
due 
examination. 
But 
far 
the 
greater 
number 
of 
those 
who 
have 
assented 
to 
the 
philosophy 
of 
Aristotle 
have 
addicted 
themselves 
thereto 
from 
prejudgment 
and 
upon 
the 
authority 
of 
others; 
so 
that 
it 
is 
a 
following 
and 
going 
along 
together, 
rather 
than 
consent. 
But 
even 
if 
it 
had 
been 
a 
real 
and 
widespread 
consent, 
still 
so 
little 
ought 
consent 
to 
be 
deemed 
a 
sure 
and 
solid 
confirmation, 
that 
it 
is 
in 
fact 
a 
strong 
presumption 
the 
other 
way. 
For 
the 
worst 
of 
all 
auguries 
is 
from 
consent 
in 
matters 
intellectual 
(divinity 
excepted, 
and 
politics 
where 
there 
is 
right 
of 
vote). 
For 
nothing 
pleases 
the 
many 
unless 
it 
strikes 
the 
imagination, 
or 
binds 
the 
understanding 
with 
the 
bands 
of 
common 
notions, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
said. 
We 
may 
very 
well 
transfer, 
therefore, 
from 
moral 
to 
intellectual 
matters 
the 
saying 
of 
Phocion, 
that 
if 
the 
multitude 
assent 
and 
applaud, 
men 
ought 
immediately 
to 
examine 
themselves 
as 
to 
what 
blunder 
or 
fault 
they 
may 
have 
committed. 
This 
sign, 
therefore, 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
unfavorable. 
And 
so 
much 
for 
this 
point; 
namely, 
that 
the 
signs 
of 
truth 
and 
soundness 
in 
the 
received 
systems 
and 
sciences 
are 
not 
good, 
whether 
they 
be 
drawn 
from 
their 
origin, 
or 
from 
their 
fruits, 
or 
from 
their 
progress, 
or 
from 
the 
confessions 
of 
their 
founders, 
or 
from 
general 
consent. 


LXXVIII 


I 
now 
come 
to 
the 
causes 
of 
these 
errors, 
and 
of 
so 
long 
a 
continuance 
in 
them 
through 
so 
many 
ages, 
which 
are 
very 
many 
and 
very 
potent; 
that 
all 
wonder 
how 
these 
considerations 
which 
I 
bring 
forward 
should 
have 
escaped 
men's 
notice 
till 
now 
may 
cease, 
and 
the 
only 
wonder 
be 
how 
now 
at 
last 
they 
should 
have 
entered 
into 
any 
man's 
head 
and 
become 



the 
subject 
of 
his 
thoughts 
— 
which 
truly 
I 
myself 
esteem 
as 
the 
result 
of 
some 
happy 
accident, 
rather 
than 
of 
any 
excellence 
of 
faculty 
in 
me 
— 
a 
birth 
of 
Time 
rather 
than 
a 
birth 
of 
Wit. 
Now, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
those 
so 
many 
ages, 
if 
you 
weigh 
the 
case 
truly, 
shrink 
into 
a 
very 
small 
compass. 
For 
out 
of 
the 
five 
and 
twenty 
centuries 
over 
which 
the 
memory 
and 
learning 
of 
men 
extends, 
you 
can 
hardly 
pick 
out 
six 
that 
were 
fertile 
in 
sciences 
or 
favorable 
to 
their 
development. 
In 
times 
no 
less 
than 
in 
regions 
there 
are 
wastes 
and 
deserts. 
For 
only 
three 
revolutions 
and 
periods 
of 
learning 
can 
properly 
be 
reckoned: 
one 
among 
the 
Greeks, 
the 
second 
among 
the 
Romans, 
and 
the 
last 
among 
us, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
nations 
of 
Western 
Europe. 
And 
to 
each 
of 
these 
hardly 
two 
centuries 
can 
justly 
be 
assigned. 
The 
intervening 
ages 
of 
the 
world, 
in 
respect 
of 
any 
rich 
or 
flourishing 
growth 
of 
the 
sciences, 
were 
unprosperous. 
For 
neither 
the 
Arabians 
nor 
the 
Schoolmen 
need 
be 
mentioned, 
who 
in 
the 
intermediate 
times 
rather 
crushed 
the 
sciences 
with 
a 
multitude 
of 
treatises, 
than 
increased 
their 
weight. 
And 
therefore 
the 
first 
cause 
of 
so 
meager 
a 
progress 
in 
the 
sciences 
is 
duly 
and 
orderly 
referred 
to 
the 
narrow 
limits 
of 
the 
time 
that 
has 
been 
favorable 
to 
them. 


LXXIX 


In 
the 
second 
place 
there 
presents 
itself 
a 
cause 
of 
great 
weight 
in 
all 
ways, 
namely, 
that 
during 
those 
very 
ages 
in 
which 
the 
wits 
and 
learning 
of 
men 
have 
flourished 
most, 
or 
indeed 
flourished 
at 
all, 
the 
least 
part 
of 
their 
diligence 
was 
given 
to 
natural 
philosophy. 
Yet 
this 
very 
philosophy 
it 
is 
that 
ought 
to 
be 
esteemed 
the 
great 
mother 
of 
the 
sciences. 
For 
all 
arts 
and 
all 
sciences, 
if 
torn 
from 
this 
root, 
though 
they 
may 
be 
polished 
and 
shaped 
and 
made 
fit 
for 
use, 
yet 
they 
will 
hardly 
grow. 
Now 
it 
is 
well 
known 
that 
after 
the 
Christian 
religion 
was 
received 
and 
grew 
strong, 
by 
far 
the 
greater 
number 
of 
the 
best 
wits 
applied 
themselves 
to 
theology; 
that 
to 
this 
both 
the 
highest 
rewards 
were 
offered, 
and 
helps 
of 
all 
kinds 
most 
abundantly 
supplied; 
and 
that 
this 
devotion 
to 
theology 
chiefly 
occupied 
that 
third 
portion 
or 
epoch 
of 
time 
among 
us 
Europeans 
of 
the 
West, 
and 
the 
more 
so 
because 
about 
the 
same 
time 
both 
literature 
began 
to 
flourish 
and 
religious 
controversies 
to 
spring 
up. 
In 
the 
age 
before, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
during 
the 
continuance 
of 
the 
second 
period 
among 
the 
Romans, 
the 
meditations 
and 
labors 
of 
philosophers 
were 
principally 
employed 
and 
consumed 
on 
moral 
philosophy, 
which 
to 
the 
heathen 
was 
as 
theology 
to 
us. 
Moreover, 
in 
those 



times 
the 
greatest 
wits 
applied 
themselves 
very 
generally 
to 
public 
affairs, 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
Roman 
empire 
requiring 
the 
services 
of 
a 
great 
number 
of 
persons. 
Again, 
the 
age 
in 
which 
natural 
philosophy 
was 
seen 
to 
flourish 
most 
among 
the 
Greeks 
was 
but 
a 
brief 
particle 
of 
time; 
for 
in 
early 
ages 
the 
Seven 
Wise 
Men, 
as 
they 
were 
called 
(all 
except 
Thales), 
applied 
themselves 
to 
morals 
and 
politics; 
and 
in 
later 
times, 
when 
Socrates 
had 
drawn 
down 
philosophy 
from 
heaven 
to 
earth, 
moral 
philosophy 
became 
more 
fashionable 
than 
ever, 
and 
diverted 
the 
minds 
of 
men 
from 
the 
philosophy 
of 
nature. 


Nay, 
the 
very 
period 
itself 
in 
which 
inquiries 
concerning 
nature 
flourished, 
was 
by 
controversies 
and 
the 
ambitious 
display 
of 
new 
opinions 
corrupted 
and 
made 
useless. 
Seeing 
therefore 
that 
during 
those 
three 
periods 
natural 
philosophy 
was 
in 
a 
great 
degree 
either 
neglected 
or 
hindered, 
it 
is 
no 
wonder 
if 
men 
made 
but 
small 
advance 
in 
that 
to 
which 
they 
were 
not 
attending. 


LXXX 


To 
this 
it 
may 
be 
added 
that 
natural 
philosophy, 
even 
among 
those 
who 
have 
attended 
to 
it, 
has 
scarcely 
ever 
possessed, 
especially 
in 
these 
later 
times, 
a 
disengaged 
and 
whole 
man 
(unless 
it 
were 
some 
monk 
studying 
in 
his 
cell, 
or 
some 
gentleman 
in 
his 
country 
house), 
but 
that 
it 
has 
been 
made 
merely 
a 
passage 
and 
bridge 
to 
something 
else. 
And 
so 
this 
great 
mother 
of 
the 
sciences 
has 
with 
strange 
indignity 
been 
degraded 
to 
the 
offices 
of 
a 
servant, 
having 
to 
attend 
on 
the 
business 
of 
medicine 
or 
mathematics, 
and 
likewise 
to 
wash 
and 
imbue 
youthful 
and 
unripe 
wits 
with 
a 
sort 
of 
first 
dye, 
in 
order 
that 
they 
may 
be 
the 
fitter 
to 
receive 
another 
afterwards. 
Meanwhile 
let 
no 
man 
look 
for 
much 
progress 
in 
the 
sciences 
— 
especially 
in 
the 
practical 
part 
of 
them 
— 
unless 
natural 
philosophy 
be 
carried 
on 
and 
applied 
to 
particular 
sciences, 
and 
particular 
sciences 
be 
carried 
back 
again 
to 
natural 
philosophy. 
For 
want 
of 
this, 
astronomy, 
optics, 
music, 
a 
number 
of 
mechanical 
arts, 
medicine 
itself 
— 
nay, 
what 
one 
might 
more 
wonder 
at, 
moral 
and 
political 
philosophy, 
and 
the 
logical 
sciences 
— 
altogether 
lack 
profoundness, 
and 
merely 
glide 
along 
the 
surface 
and 
variety 
of 
things. 
Because 
after 
these 
particular 
sciences 
have 
been 
once 
distributed 
and 
established, 
they 
are 
no 
more 
nourished 
by 
natural 
philosophy, 
which 
might 
have 
drawn 
out 
of 
the 
true 
contemplation 
of 
motions, 
rays, 
sounds, 
texture 



and 
configuration 
of 
bodies, 
affections, 
and 
intellectual 
perceptions, 
the 
means 
of 
imparting 
to 
them 
fresh 
strength 
and 
growth. 
And 
therefore 
it 
is 
nothing 
strange 
if 
the 
sciences 
grow 
not, 
seeing 
they 
are 
parted 
from 
their 
roots. 


LXXXI 


Again 
there 
is 
another 
great 
and 
powerful 
cause 
why 
the 
sciences 
have 
made 
but 
little 
progress, 
which 
is 
this. 
It 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
run 
a 
course 
aright 
when 
the 
goal 
itself 
has 
not 
been 
rightly 
placed. 
Now 
the 
true 
and 
lawful 
goal 
of 
the 
sciences 
is 
none 
other 
than 
this: 
that 
human 
life 
be 
endowed 
with 
new 
discoveries 
and 
powers. 
But 
of 
this 
the 
great 
majority 
have 
no 
feeling, 
but 
are 
merely 
hireling 
and 
professorial; 
except 
when 
it 
occasionally 
happens 
that 
some 
workman 
of 
acuter 
wit 
and 
covetous 
of 
honor 
applies 
himself 
to 
a 
new 
invention, 
which 
he 
mostly 
does 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
his 
fortunes. 
But 
in 
general, 
so 
far 
are 
men 
from 
proposing 
to 
themselves 
to 
augment 
the 
mass 
of 
arts 
and 
sciences, 
that 
from 
the 
mass 
already 
at 
hand 
they 
neither 
take 
nor 
look 
for 
anything 
more 
than 
what 
they 
may 
turn 
to 
use 
in 
their 
lectures, 
or 
to 
gain, 
or 
to 
reputation, 
or 
to 
some 
similar 
advantage. 
And 
if 
any 
one 
out 
of 
all 
the 
multitude 
court 
science 
with 
honest 
affection 
and 
for 
her 
own 
sake, 
yet 
even 
with 
him 
the 
object 
will 
be 
found 
to 
be 
rather 
the 
variety 
of 
contemplations 
and 
doctrines 
than 
the 
severe 
and 
rigid 
search 
after 
truth. 
And 
if 
by 
chance 
there 
be 
one 
who 
seeks 
after 
truth 
in 
earnest, 
yet 
even 
he 
will 
propose 
to 
himself 
such 
a 
kind 
of 
truth 
as 
shall 
yield 
satisfaction 
to 
the 
mind 
and 
understanding 
in 
rendering 
causes 
for 
things 
long 
since 
discovered, 
and 
not 
the 
truth 
which 
shall 
lead 
to 
new 
assurance 
of 
works 
and 
new 
light 
of 
axioms. 
If 
then 
the 
end 
of 
the 
sciences 
has 
not 
as 
yet 
been 
well 
placed, 
it 
is 
not 
strange 
that 
men 
have 
erred 
as 
to 
the 
means. 


LXXXII 


And 
as 
men 
have 
misplaced 
the 
end 
and 
goal 
of 
the 
sciences, 
so 
again, 
even 
if 
they 
had 
placed 
it 
right, 
yet 
they 
have 
chosen 
a 
way 
to 
it 
which 
is 
altogether 
erroneous 
and 
impassable. 
And 
an 
astonishing 
thing 
it 
is 
to 
one 
who 
rightly 
considers 
the 
matter, 
that 
no 
mortal 
should 
have 
seriously 
applied 
himself 
to 
the 
opening 
and 
laying 
out 
of 
a 
road 
for 
the 
human 
understanding 



direct 
from 
the 
sense, 
by 
a 
course 
of 
experiment 
orderly 
conducted 
and 
well 
built 
up, 
but 
that 
all 
has 
been 
left 
either 
to 
the 
mist 
of 
tradition, 
or 
the 
whirl 
and 
eddy 
of 
argument, 
or 
the 
fluctuations 
and 
mazes 
of 
chance 
and 
of 
vague 
and 
ill-digested 
experience. 
Now 
let 
any 
man 
soberly 
and 
diligently 
consider 
what 
the 
way 
is 
by 
which 
men 
have 
been 
accustomed 
to 
proceed 
in 
the 
investigation 
and 
discovery 
of 
things, 
and 
in 
the 
first 
place 
he 
will 
no 
doubt 
remark 
a 
method 
of 
discovery 
very 
simple 
and 
inartificial, 
which 
is 
the 
most 
ordinary 
method, 
and 
is 
no 
more 
than 
this. 
When 
a 
man 
addresses 
himself 
to 
discover 
something, 
he 
first 
seeks 
out 
and 
sets 
before 
him 
all 
that 
has 
been 
said 
about 
it 
by 
others; 
then 
he 
begins 
to 
meditate 
for 
himself; 
and 
so 
by 
much 
agitation 
and 
working 
of 
the 
wit 
solicits 
and 
as 
it 
were 
evokes 
his 
own 
spirit 
to 
give 
him 
oracles; 
which 
method 
has 
no 
foundation 
at 
all, 
but 
rests 
only 
upon 
opinions 
and 
is 
carried 
about 
with 
them. 


Another 
may 
perhaps 
call 
in 
logic 
to 
discover 
it 
for 
him, 
but 
that 
has 
no 
relation 
to 
the 
matter 
except 
in 
name. 
For 
logical 
invention 
does 
not 
discover 
principles 
and 
chief 
axioms, 
of 
which 
arts 
are 
composed, 
but 
only 
such 
things 
as 
appear 
to 
be 
consistent 
with 
them. 
For 
if 
you 
grow 
more 
curious 
and 
importunate 
and 
busy, 
and 
question 
her 
of 
probations 
and 
invention 
of 
principles 
or 
primary 
axioms, 
her 
answer 
is 
well 
known; 
she 
refers 
you 
to 
the 
faith 
you 
are 
bound 
to 
give 
to 
the 
principles 
of 
each 
separate 
art. 


There 
remains 
simple 
experience 
which, 
if 
taken 
as 
it 
comes, 
is 
called 
accident; 
if 
sought 
for, 
experiment. 
But 
this 
kind 
of 
experience 
is 
no 
better 
than 
a 
broom 
without 
its 
band, 
as 
the 
saying 
is 
— 
a 
mere 
groping, 
as 
of 
men 
in 
the 
dark, 
that 
feel 
all 
round 
them 
for 
the 
chance 
of 
finding 
their 
way, 
when 
they 
had 
much 
better 
wait 
for 
daylight, 
or 
light 
a 
candle, 
and 
then 
go. 
But 
the 
true 
method 
of 
experience, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
first 
lights 
the 
candle, 
and 
then 
by 
means 
of 
the 
candle 
shows 
the 
way; 
commencing 
as 
it 
does 
with 
experience 
duly 
ordered 
and 
digested, 
not 
bungling 
or 
erratic, 
and 
from 
it 
educing 
axioms, 
and 
from 
established 
axioms 
again 
new 
experiments; 
even 
as 
it 
was 
not 
without 
order 
and 
method 
that 
the 
divine 
word 
operated 
on 
the 
created 
mass. 
Let 
men 
therefore 
cease 
to 
wonder 
that 
the 
course 
of 
science 
is 
not 
yet 
wholly 
run, 
seeing 
that 
they 
have 
gone 
altogether 
astray, 
either 
leaving 
and 
abandoning 
experience 
entirely, 
or 
losing 
their 
way 
in 
it 
and 
wandering 
round 
and 
round 
as 
in 
a 
labyrinth. 
Whereas 
a 
method 
rightly 
ordered 
leads 
by 
an 
unbroken 
route 
through 
the 
woods 
of 
experience 
to 
the 



open 
ground 
of 
axioms. 


LXXXIII 


This 
evil, 
however, 
has 
been 
strangely 
increased 
by 
an 
opinion 
or 
conceit, 
which 
though 
of 
long 
standing 
is 
vain 
and 
hurtful, 
namely, 
that 
the 
dignity 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
is 
impaired 
by 
long 
and 
close 
intercourse 
with 
experiments 
and 
particulars, 
subject 
to 
sense 
and 
bound 
in 
matter; 
especially 
as 
they 
are 
laborious 
to 
search, 
ignoble 
to 
meditate, 
harsh 
to 
deliver, 
illiberal 
to 
practice, 
infinite 
in 
number, 
and 
minute 
in 
subtlety. 
So 
that 
it 
has 
come 
at 
length 
to 
this, 
that 
the 
true 
way 
is 
not 
merely 
deserted, 
but 
shut 
out 
and 
stopped 
up; 
experience 
being, 
I 
do 
not 
say 
abandoned 
or 
badly 
managed, 
but 
rejected 
with 
disdain. 


LXXXIV 


Again, 
men 
have 
been 
kept 
back 
as 
by 
a 
kind 
of 
enchantment 
from 
progress 
in 
the 
sciences 
by 
reverence 
for 
antiquity, 
by 
the 
authority 
of 
men 
accounted 
great 
in 
philosophy, 
and 
then 
by 
general 
consent. 
Of 
the 
last 
I 
have 
spoken 
above. 


As 
for 
antiquity, 
the 
opinion 
touching 
it 
which 
men 
entertain 
is 
quite 
a 
negligent 
one 
and 
scarcely 
consonant 
with 
the 
word 
itself. 
For 
the 
old 
age 
of 
the 
world 
is 
to 
be 
accounted 
the 
true 
antiquity; 
and 
this 
is 
the 
attribute 
of 
our 
own 
times, 
not 
of 
that 
earlier 
age 
of 
the 
world 
in 
which 
the 
ancients 
lived, 
and 
which, 
though 
in 
respect 
of 
us 
it 
was 
the 
elder, 
yet 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
world 
it 
was 
the 
younger. 
And 
truly 
as 
we 
look 
for 
greater 
knowledge 
of 
human 
things 
and 
a 
riper 
judgment 
in 
the 
old 
man 
than 
in 
the 
young, 
because 
of 
his 
experience 
and 
of 
the 
number 
and 
variety 
of 
the 
things 
which 
he 
has 
seen 
and 
heard 
and 
thought 
of, 
so 
in 
like 
manner 
from 
our 
age, 
if 
it 
but 
knew 
its 
own 
strength 
and 
chose 
to 
essay 
and 
exert 
it, 
much 
more 
might 
fairly 
be 
expected 
than 
from 
the 
ancient 
times, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
is 
a 
more 
advanced 
age 
of 
the 
world, 
and 
stored 
and 
stocked 
with 
infinite 
experiments 
and 
observations. 


Nor 
must 
it 
go 
for 
nothing 
that 
by 
the 
distant 
voyages 
and 
travels 
which 
have 
become 
frequent 
in 
our 
times 
many 
things 
in 
nature 
have 
been 
laid 
open 
and 
discovered 
which 
may 
let 
in 
new 
light 
upon 
philosophy. 
And 



surely 
it 
would 
be 
disgraceful 
if, 
while 
the 
regions 
of 
the 
material 
globe 
— 
that 
is, 
of 
the 
earth, 
of 
the 
sea, 
and 
of 
the 
stars 
— 
have 
been 
in 
our 
times 
laid 
widely 
open 
and 
revealed, 
the 
intellectual 
globe 
should 
remain 
shut 
up 
within 
the 
narrow 
limits 
of 
old 
discoveries. 


And 
with 
regard 
to 
authority, 
it 
shows 
a 
feeble 
mind 
to 
grant 
so 
much 
to 
authors 
and 
yet 
deny 
time 
his 
rights, 
who 
is 
the 
author 
of 
authors, 
nay, 
rather 
of 
all 
authority. 
For 
rightly 
is 
truth 
called 
the 
daughter 
of 
time, 
not 
of 
authority. 
It 
is 
no 
wonder 
therefore 
if 
those 
enchantments 
of 
antiquity 
and 
authority 
and 
consent 
have 
so 
bound 
up 
men's 
powers 
that 
they 
have 
been 
made 
impotent 
(like 
persons 
bewitched) 
to 
accompany 
with 
the 
nature 
of 
things. 


LXXXV 


Nor 
is 
it 
only 
the 
admiration 
of 
antiquity, 
authority, 
and 
consent, 
that 
has 
forced 
the 
industry 
of 
man 
to 
rest 
satisfied 
with 
the 
discoveries 
already 
made, 
but 
also 
an 
admiration 
for 
the 
works 
themselves 
of 
which 
the 
human 
race 
has 
long 
been 
in 
possession. 
For 
when 
a 
man 
looks 
at 
the 
variety 
and 
the 
beauty 
of 
the 
provision 
which 
the 
mechanical 
arts 
have 
brought 
together 
for 
men's 
use, 
he 
will 
certainly 
be 
more 
inclined 
to 
admire 
the 
wealth 
of 
man 
than 
to 
feel 
his 
wants; 
not 
considering 
that 
the 
original 
observations 
and 
operations 
of 
nature 
(which 
are 
the 
life 
and 
moving 
principle 
of 
all 
that 
variety) 
are 
not 
many 
nor 
deeply 
fetched, 
and 
that 
the 
rest 
is 
but 
patience, 
and 
the 
subtle 
and 
ruled 
motion 
of 
the 
hand 
and 
instruments 
— 
as 
the 
making 
of 
clocks 
(for 
instance) 
is 
certainly 
a 
subtle 
and 
exact 
work: 
their 
wheels 
seem 
to 
imitate 
the 
celestial 
orbs, 
and 
their 
alternating 
and 
orderly 
motion, 
the 
pulse 
of 
animals; 
and 
yet 
all 
this 
depends 
on 
one 
or 
two 
axioms 
of 
nature. 


Again, 
if 
you 
observe 
the 
refinement 
of 
the 
liberal 
arts, 
or 
even 
that 
which 
relates 
to 
the 
mechanical 
preparation 
of 
natural 
substances, 
and 
take 
notice 
of 
such 
things 
as 
the 
discovery 
in 
astronomy 
of 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
heavens, 
of 
harmony 
in 
music, 
of 
the 
letters 
of 
the 
alphabet 
(to 
this 
day 
not 
in 
use 
among 
the 
Chinese) 
in 
grammar; 
or 
again 
in 
things 
mechanical, 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
works 
of 
Bacchus 
and 
Ceres 
— 
that 
is, 
of 
the 
arts 
of 
preparing 
wine 
and 
beer, 
and 
of 
making 
bread; 
the 
discovery 
once 
more 
of 
the 
delicacies 
of 
the 
table, 
of 
distillations 
and 
the 
like; 
and 
if 
you 
likewise 
bear 
in 
mind 
the 
long 
periods 
which 
it 
has 
taken 
to 
bring 
these 
things 
to 
their 



present 
degree 
of 
perfection 
(for 
they 
are 
all 
ancient 
except 
distillation), 
and 
again 
(as 
has 
been 
said 
of 
clocks) 
how 
little 
they 
owe 
to 
observations 
and 
axioms 
of 
nature, 
and 
how 
easily 
and 
obviously 
and 
as 
it 
were 
by 
casual 
suggestion 
they 
may 
have 
been 
discovered; 
you 
will 
easily 
cease 
from 
wondering, 
and 
on 
the 
contrary 
will 
pity 
the 
condition 
of 
mankind, 
seeing 
that 
in 
a 
course 
of 
so 
many 
ages 
there 
has 
been 
so 
great 
a 
dearth 
and 
barrenness 
of 
arts 
and 
inventions. 
And 
yet 
these 
very 
discoveries 
which 
we 
have 
just 
mentioned 
are 
older 
than 
philosophy 
and 
intellectual 
arts. 
So 
that, 
if 
the 
truth 
must 
be 
spoken, 
when 
the 
rational 
and 
dogmatical 
sciences 
began, 
the 
discovery 
of 
useful 
works 
came 
to 
an 
end. 


And 
again, 
if 
a 
man 
turn 
from 
the 
workshop 
to 
the 
library, 
and 
wonder 
at 
the 
immense 
variety 
of 
books 
he 
sees 
there, 
let 
him 
but 
examine 
and 
diligently 
inspect 
their 
matter 
and 
contents, 
and 
his 
wonder 
will 
assuredly 
be 
turned 
the 
other 
way. 
For 
after 
observing 
their 
endless 
repetitions, 
and 
how 
men 
are 
ever 
saying 
and 
doing 
what 
has 
been 
said 
and 
done 
before, 
he 
will 
pass 
from 
admiration 
of 
the 
variety 
to 
astonishment 
at 
the 
poverty 
and 
scantiness 
of 
the 
subjects 
which 
till 
now 
have 
occupied 
and 
possessed 
the 
minds 
of 
men. 


And 
if 
again 
he 
descend 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
those 
arts 
which 
are 
deemed 
curious 
rather 
than 
safe, 
and 
look 
more 
closely 
into 
the 
works 
of 
the 
alchemists 
or 
the 
magicians, 
he 
will 
be 
in 
doubt 
perhaps 
whether 
he 
ought 
rather 
to 
laugh 
over 
them 
or 
to 
weep. 
For 
the 
alchemist 
nurses 
eternal 
hope 
and 
when 
the 
thing 
fails, 
lays 
the 
blame 
upon 
some 
error 
of 
his 
own; 
fearing 
either 
that 
he 
has 
not 
sufficiently 
understood 
the 
words 
of 
his 
art 
or 
of 
his 
authors 
(whereupon 
he 
turns 
to 
tradition 
and 
auricular 
whispers), 
or 
else 
that 
in 
his 
manipulations 
he 
has 
made 
some 
slip 
of 
a 
scruple 
in 
weight 
or 
a 
moment 
in 
time 
(whereupon 
he 
repeats 
his 
trials 
to 
infinity). 
And 
when, 
meanwhile, 
among 
the 
chances 
of 
experiment 
he 
lights 
upon 
some 
conclusions 
either 
in 
aspect 
new 
or 
for 
utility 
not 
contemptible, 
he 
takes 
these 
for 
earnest 
of 
what 
is 
to 
come, 
and 
feeds 
his 
mind 
upon 
them, 
and 
magnifies 
them 
to 
the 
most, 
and 
supplies 
the 
rest 
in 
hope. 
Not 
but 
that 
the 
alchemists 
have 
made 
a 
good 
many 
discoveries 
and 
presented 
men 
with 
useful 
inventions. 
But 
their 
case 
may 
be 
well 
compared 
to 
the 
fable 
of 
the 
old 
man 
who 
bequeathed 
to 
his 
sons 
gold 
buried 
in 
a 
vineyard, 
pretending 
not 
to 
know 
the 
exact 
spot; 
whereupon 
the 
sons 
applied 
themselves 
diligently 
to 
the 
digging 
of 
the 
vineyard, 
and 
though 
no 
gold 
was 
found 
there, 
yet 
the 
vintage 



by 
that 
digging 
was 
made 
more 
plentiful. 


Again 
the 
students 
of 
natural 
magic, 
who 
explain 
everything 
by 
sympathies 
and 
antipathies, 
have 
in 
their 
idle 
and 
most 
slothful 
conjectures 
ascribed 
to 
substances 
wonderful 
virtues 
and 
operations; 
and 
if 
ever 
they 
have 
produced 
works, 
they 
have 
been 
such 
as 
aim 
rather 
at 
admiration 
and 
novelty 
than 
at 
utility 
and 
fruit. 


In 
superstitious 
magic 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
(if 
of 
this 
also 
we 
must 
speak), 
it 
is 
especially 
to 
be 
observed 
that 
they 
are 
but 
subjects 
of 
a 
certain 
and 
definite 
kind 
wherein 
the 
curious 
and 
superstitious 
arts, 
in 
all 
nations 
and 
ages, 
and 
religions 
also, 
have 
worked 
or 
played. 
These 
therefore 
we 
may 
pass. 
Meanwhile 
if 
is 
nowise 
strange 
if 
opinion 
of 
plenty 
has 
been 
the 
cause 
of 
want. 


LXXXVI 


Further, 
this 
admiration 
of 
men 
for 
knowledges 
and 
arts 
— 
an 
admiration 
in 
itself 
weak 
enough, 
and 
well-nigh 
childish 
— 
has 
been 
increased 
by 
the 
craft 
and 
artifices 
of 
those 
who 
have 
handled 
and 
transmitted 
sciences. 
For 
they 
set 
them 
forth 
with 
such 
ambition 
and 
parade, 
and 
bring 
them 
into 
the 
view 
of 
the 
world 
so 
fashioned 
and 
masked 
as 
if 
they 
were 
complete 
in 
all 
parts 
and 
finished. 
For 
if 
you 
look 
at 
the 
method 
of 
them 
and 
the 
divisions, 
they 
seem 
to 
embrace 
and 
comprise 
everything 
which 
can 
belong 
to 
the 
subject. 
And 
although 
these 
divisions 
are 
ill 
filled 
out 
and 
are 
but 
as 
empty 
cases, 
still 
to 
the 
common 
mind 
they 
present 
the 
form 
and 
plan 
of 
a 
perfect 
science. 
But 
the 
first 
and 
most 
ancient 
seekers 
after 
truth 
were 
wont, 
with 
better 
faith 
and 
better 
fortune, 
too, 
to 
throw 
the 
knowledge 
which 
they 
gathered 
from 
the 
contemplation 
of 
things, 
and 
which 
they 
meant 
to 
store 
up 
for 
use, 
into 
aphorisms; 
that 
is, 
into 
short 
and 
scattered 
sentences, 
not 
linked 
together 
by 
an 
artificial 
method; 
and 
did 
not 
pretend 
or 
profess 
to 
embrace 
the 
entire 
art. 
But 
as 
the 
matter 
now 
is, 
it 
is 
nothing 
strange 
if 
men 
do 
not 
seek 
to 
advance 
in 
things 
delivered 
to 
them 
as 
long 
since 
perfect 
and 
complete. 


LXXXVII 



Moreover, 
the 
ancient 
systems 
have 
received 
no 
slight 
accession 
of 
reputation 
and 
credit 
from 
the 
vanity 
and 
levity 
of 
those 
who 
have 
propounded 
new 
ones, 
especially 
in 
the 
active 
and 
practical 
department 
of 
natural 
philosophy. 
For 
there 
have 
not 
been 
wanting 
talkers 
and 
dreamers 
who, 
partly 
from 
credulity, 
partly 
in 
imposture, 
have 
loaded 
mankind 
with 
promises, 
offering 
and 
announcing 
the 
prolongation 
of 
life, 
the 
retardation 
of 
age, 
the 
alleviation 
of 
pain, 
the 
repairing 
of 
natural 
defects, 
the 
deceiving 
of 
the 
senses; 
arts 
of 
binding 
and 
inciting 
the 
affections, 
of 
illuminating 
and 
exalting 
the 
intellectual 
faculties, 
of 
transmuting 
substances, 
of 
strengthening 
and 
multiplying 
motions 
at 
will, 
of 
making 
impressions 
and 
alterations 
in 
the 
air, 
of 
bringing 
down 
and 
procuring 
celestial 
influences; 
arts 
of 
divining 
things 
future, 
and 
bringing 
things 
distant 
near, 
and 
revealing 
things 
secret; 
and 
many 
more. 
But 
with 
regard 
to 
these 
lavish 
promisers, 
this 
judgment 
would 
not 
be 
far 
amiss: 
that 
there 
is 
as 
much 
difference 
in 
philosophy 
between 
their 
vanities 
and 
true 
arts 
as 
there 
is 
in 
history 
between 
the 
exploits 
of 
Julius 
Caesar 
or 
Alexander 
the 
Great, 
and 
the 
exploits 
of 
Amadis 
of 
Gaul 
or 
Arthur 
of 
Britain. 
For 
it 
is 
true 
that 
those 
illustrious 
generals 
really 
did 
greater 
things 
than 
these 
shadowy 
heroes 
are 
even 
feigned 
to 
have 
done; 
but 
they 
did 
them 
by 
means 
and 
ways 
of 
action 
not 
fabulous 
or 
monstrous. 
Yet 
surely 
it 
is 
not 
fair 
that 
the 
credit 
of 
true 
history 
should 
be 
lessened 
because 
it 
has 
sometimes 
been 
injured 
and 
wronged 
by 
fables. 
Meanwhile 
it 
is 
not 
to 
be 
wondered 
at 
if 
a 
great 
prejudice 
is 
raised 
against 
new 
propositions, 
especially 
when 
works 
are 
also 
mentioned, 
because 
of 
those 
impostors 
who 
have 
attempted 
the 
like; 
since 
their 
excess 
of 
vanity, 
and 
the 
disgust 
it 
has 
bred, 
have 
their 
effect 
still 
in 
the 
destruction 
of 
all 
greatness 
of 
mind 
in 
enterprises 
of 
this 
kind. 


LXXXVIII 


Far 
more, 
however, 
has 
knowledge 
suffered 
from 
littleness 
of 
spirit 
and 
the 
smallness 
and 
slightness 
of 
the 
tasks 
which 
human 
industry 
has 
proposed 
to 
itself. 
And 
what 
is 
worst 
of 
all, 
this 
very 
littleness 
of 
spirit 
comes 
with 
a 
certain 
air 
of 
arrogance 
and 
superiority. 


For 
in 
the 
first 
place 
there 
is 
found 
in 
all 
arts 
one 
general 
device, 
which 
has 
now 
become 
familiar 
— 
that 
the 
author 
lays 
the 
weakness 
of 
his 
art 
to 
the 
charge 
of 
nature: 
whatever 
his 
art 
cannot 
attain 
he 
sets 
down 
on 
the 



authority 
of 
the 
same 
art 
to 
be 
in 
nature 
impossible. 
And 
truly 
no 
art 
can 
be 
condemned 
if 
it 
be 
judge 
itself. 
Moreover, 
the 
philosophy 
which 
is 
now 
in 
vogue 
embraces 
and 
cherishes 
certain 
tenets, 
the 
purpose 
of 
which 
(if 
it 
be 
diligently 
examined) 
is 
to 
persuade 
men 
that 
nothing 
difficult, 
nothing 
by 
which 
nature 
may 
be 
commanded 
and 
subdued, 
can 
be 
expected 
from 
art 
or 
human 
labor; 
as 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
doctrine 
that 
the 
heat 
of 
the 
sun 
and 
of 
fire 
differ 
in 
kind, 
and 
to 
that 
other 
concerning 
mixture, 
has 
been 
already 
observed. 
Which 
things, 
if 
they 
be 
noted 
accurately, 
tend 
wholly 
to 
the 
unfair 
circumscription 
of 
human 
power, 
and 
to 
a 
deliberate 
and 
factitious 
despair, 
which 
not 
only 
disturbs 
the 
auguries 
of 
hope, 
but 
also 
cuts 
the 
sinews 
and 
spur 
of 
industry, 
and 
throws 
away 
the 
chances 
of 
experience 
itself. 
And 
all 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
having 
their 
art 
thought 
perfect, 
and 
for 
the 
miserable 
vainglory 
of 
making 
it 
believed 
that 
whatever 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
discovered 
and 
comprehended 
can 
never 
be 
discovered 
or 
comprehended 
hereafter. 


And 
even 
if 
a 
man 
apply 
himself 
fairly 
to 
facts, 
and 
endeavor 
to 
find 
out 
something 
new, 
yet 
he 
will 
confine 
his 
aim 
and 
intention 
to 
the 
investigation 
and 
working 
out 
of 
some 
one 
discovery 
and 
no 
more; 
such 
as 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
magnet, 
the 
ebb 
and 
flow 
of 
the 
sea, 
the 
system 
of 
the 
heavens, 
and 
things 
of 
this 
kind, 
which 
seem 
to 
be 
in 
some 
measure 
secret, 
and 
have 
hitherto 
been 
handled 
without 
much 
success. 
Whereas 
it 
is 
most 
unskillful 
to 
investigate 
the 
nature 
of 
anything 
in 
the 
thing 
itself, 
seeing 
that 
the 
same 
nature 
which 
appears 
in 
some 
things 
to 
be 
latent 
and 
hidden 
is 
in 
others 
manifest 
and 
palpable; 
wherefore 
in 
the 
former 
it 
produces 
wonder, 
in 
the 
latter 
excites 
no 
attention; 
as 
we 
find 
it 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
consistency, 
which 
in 
wood 
or 
stone 
is 
not 
observed, 
but 
is 
passed 
over 
under 
the 
appellation 
of 
solidity 
without 
further 
inquiry 
as 
to 
why 
separation 
or 
solution 
of 
continuity 
is 
avoided; 
while 
in 
the 
case 
of 
bubbles, 
which 
form 
themselves 
into 
certain 
pellicles, 
curiously 
shaped 
into 
hemispheres, 
so 
that 
the 
solution 
of 
continuity 
is 
avoided 
for 
a 
moment, 
it 
is 
thought 
a 
subtle 
matter. 
In 
fact, 
what 
in 
some 
things 
is 
accounted 
a 
secret 
has 
in 
others 
a 
manifest 
and 
well-known 
nature, 
which 
will 
never 
be 
recognized 
as 
long 
as 
the 
experiments 
and 
thoughts 
of 
men 
are 
engaged 
on 
the 
former 
only. 


But 
generally 
speaking, 
in 
mechanics 
old 
discoveries 
pass 
for 
new 
if 
a 
man 
does 
but 
refine 
or 
embellish 
them, 
or 
unite 
several 
in 
one, 
or 
couple 
them 
better 
with 
their 
use, 
or 
make 
the 
work 
in 
greater 
or 
less 
volume 
than 
it 
was 
before, 
or 
the 
like. 



Thus, 
then, 
it 
is 
no 
wonder 
if 
inventions 
noble 
and 
worthy 
of 
mankind 
have 
not 
been 
brought 
to 
light, 
when 
men 
have 
been 
contented 
and 
delighted 
with 
such 
trifling 
and 
puerile 
tasks, 
and 
have 
even 
fancied 
that 
in 
them 
they 
have 
been 
endeavoring 
after, 
if 
not 
accomplishing, 
some 
great 
matter. 


LXXXIX 


Neither 
is 
it 
to 
be 
forgotten 
that 
in 
every 
age 
natural 
philosophy 
has 
had 
a 
troublesome 
and 
hard 
to 
deal 
with 
adversary 
— 
namely, 
superstition, 
and 
the 
blind 
and 
immoderate 
zeal 
of 
religion. 
For 
we 
see 
among 
the 
Greeks 
that 
those 
who 
first 
proposed 
to 
men's 
then 
uninitiated 
ears 
the 
natural 
causes 
for 
thunder 
and 
for 
storms 
were 
thereupon 
found 
guilty 
of 
impiety. 
Nor 
was 
much 
more 
forbearance 
shown 
by 
some 
of 
the 
ancient 
fathers 
of 
the 
Christian 
church 
to 
those 
who 
on 
most 
convincing 
grounds 
(such 
as 
no 
one 
in 
his 
senses 
would 
now 
think 
of 
contradicting) 
maintained 
that 
the 
earth 
was 
round, 
and 
of 
consequence 
asserted 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
antipodes. 


Moreover, 
as 
things 
now 
are, 
to 
discourse 
of 
nature 
is 
made 
harder 
and 
more 
perilous 
by 
the 
summaries 
and 
systems 
of 
the 
schoolmen 
who, 
having 
reduced 
theology 
into 
regular 
order 
as 
well 
as 
they 
were 
able, 
and 
fashioned 
it 
into 
the 
shape 
of 
an 
art, 
ended 
in 
incorporating 
the 
contentious 
and 
thorny 
philosophy 
of 
Aristotle, 
more 
than 
was 
fit, 
with 
the 
body 
of 
religion. 


To 
the 
same 
result, 
though 
in 
a 
different 
way, 
tend 
the 
speculations 
of 
those 
who 
have 
taken 
upon 
them 
to 
deduce 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
Christian 
religion 
from 
the 
principles 
of 
philosophers, 
and 
to 
confirm 
it 
by 
their 
authority, 
pompously 
solemnizing 
this 
union 
of 
the 
sense 
and 
faith 
as 
a 
lawful 
marriage, 
and 
entertaining 
men's 
minds 
with 
a 
pleasing 
variety 
of 
matter, 
but 
all 
the 
while 
disparaging 
things 
divine 
by 
mingling 
them 
with 
things 
human. 
Now 
in 
such 
mixtures 
of 
theology 
with 
philosophy 
only 
the 
received 
doctrines 
of 
philosophy 
are 
included; 
while 
new 
ones, 
albeit 
changes 
for 
the 
better, 
are 
all 
but 
expelled 
and 
exterminated. 


Lastly, 
you 
will 
find 
that 
by 
the 
simpleness 
of 
certain 
divines, 
access 
to 
any 
philosophy, 
however 
pure, 
is 
well-nigh 
closed. 
Some 
are 
weakly 
afraid 
lest 
a 
deeper 
search 
into 
nature 
should 
transgress 
the 
permitted 
limits 
of 



sober-mindedness, 
wrongfully 
wresting 
and 
transferring 
what 
is 
said 
in 
Holy 
Writ 
against 
those 
who 
pry 
into 
sacred 
mysteries, 
to 
the 
hidden 
things 
of 
nature, 
which 
are 
barred 
by 
no 
prohibition. 
Others 
with 
more 
subtlety 
surmise 
and 
reflect 
that 
if 
second 
causes 
are 
unknown 
everything 
can 
more 
readily 
be 
referred 
to 
the 
divine 
hand 
and 
rod, 
a 
point 
in 
which 
they 
think 
religion 
greatly 
concerned 
— 
which 
is 
in 
fact 
nothing 
else 
but 
to 
seek 
to 
gratify 
God 
with 
a 
lie. 
Others 
fear 
from 
past 
example 
that 
movements 
and 
changes 
in 
philosophy 
will 
end 
in 
assaults 
on 
religion. 
And 
others 
again 
appear 
apprehensive 
that 
in 
the 
investigation 
of 
nature 
something 
may 
be 
found 
to 
subvert 
or 
at 
least 
shake 
the 
authority 
of 
religion, 
especially 
with 
the 
unlearned. 
But 
these 
two 
last 
fears 
seem 
to 
me 
to 
savor 
utterly 
of 
carnal 
wisdom; 
as 
if 
men 
in 
the 
recesses 
and 
secret 
thought 
of 
their 
hearts 
doubted 
and 
distrusted 
the 
strength 
of 
religion 
and 
the 
empire 
of 
faith 
over 
the 
sense, 
and 
therefore 
feared 
that 
the 
investigation 
of 
truth 
in 
nature 
might 
be 
dangerous 
to 
them. 
But 
if 
the 
matter 
be 
truly 
considered, 
natural 
philosophy 
is, 
after 
the 
word 
of 
God, 
at 
once 
the 
surest 
medicine 
against 
superstition 
and 
the 
most 
approved 
nourishment 
for 
faith, 
and 
therefore 
she 
is 
rightly 
given 
to 
religion 
as 
her 
most 
faithful 
handmaid, 
since 
the 
one 
displays 
the 
will 
of 
God, 
the 
other 
his 
power. 
For 
he 
did 
not 
err 
who 
said, 
"Ye 
err 
in 
that 
ye 
know 
not 
the 
Scriptures 
and 
the 
power 
of 
God," 
thus 
coupling 
and 
blending 
in 
an 
indissoluble 
bond 
information 
concerning 
his 
will 
and 
meditation 
concerning 
his 
power. 
Meanwhile 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
if 
the 
growth 
of 
natural 
philosophy 
is 
checked 
when 
religion, 
the 
thing 
which 
has 
most 
power 
over 
men's 
minds, 
has 
by 
the 
simpleness 
and 
incautious 
zeal 
of 
certain 
persons 
been 
drawn 
to 
take 
part 
against 
her. 


XC 


Again, 
in 
the 
customs 
and 
institutions 
of 
schools, 
academies, 
colleges, 
and 
similar 
bodies 
destined 
for 
the 
abode 
of 
learned 
men 
and 
the 
cultivation 
of 
learning, 
everything 
is 
found 
adverse 
to 
the 
progress 
of 
science. 
For 
the 
lectures 
and 
exercises 
there 
are 
so 
ordered 
that 
to 
think 
or 
speculate 
on 
anything 
out 
of 
the 
common 
way 
can 
hardly 
occur 
to 
any 
man. 
And 
if 
one 
or 
two 
have 
the 
boldness 
to 
use 
any 
liberty 
of 
judgment, 
they 
must 
undertake 
the 
task 
all 
by 
themselves; 
they 
can 
have 
no 
advantage 
from 
the 
company 
of 
others. 
And 
if 
they 
can 
endure 
this 
also, 
they 
will 
find 
their 
industry 
and 
largeness 
of 
mind 
no 
slight 
hindrance 
to 
their 
fortune. 
For 
the 
studies 
of 
men 



in 
these 
places 
are 
confined 
and 
as 
it 
were 
imprisoned 
in 
the 
writings 
of 
certain 
authors, 
from 
whom 
if 
any 
man 
dissent 
he 
is 
straightway 
arraigned 
as 
a 
turbulent 
person 
and 
an 
innovator. 
But 
surely 
there 
is 
a 
great 
distinction 
between 
matters 
of 
state 
and 
the 
arts; 
for 
the 
danger 
from 
new 
motion 
and 
from 
new 
light 
is 
not 
the 
same. 
In 
matters 
of 
state 
a 
change 
even 
for 
the 
better 
is 
distrusted, 
because 
it 
unsettles 
what 
is 
established; 
these 
things 
resting 
on 
authority, 
consent, 
fame 
and 
opinion, 
not 
on 
demonstration. 
But 
arts 
and 
sciences 
should 
be 
like 
mines, 
where 
the 
noise 
of 
new 
works 
and 
further 
advances 
is 
heard 
on 
every 
side. 
But 
though 
the 
matter 
be 
so 
according 
to 
right 
reason, 
it 
is 
not 
so 
acted 
on 
in 
practice; 
and 
the 
points 
above 
mentioned 
in 
the 
administration 
and 
government 
of 
learning 
put 
a 
severe 
restraint 
upon 
the 
advancement 
of 
the 
sciences. 


XCI 


Nay, 
even 
if 
that 
jealousy 
were 
to 
cease, 
still 
it 
is 
enough 
to 
check 
the 
growth 
of 
science 
that 
efforts 
and 
labors 
in 
this 
field 
go 
unrewarded. 
For 
it 
does 
not 
rest 
with 
the 
same 
persons 
to 
cultivate 
sciences 
and 
to 
reward 
them. 
The 
growth 
of 
them 
comes 
from 
great 
wits; 
the 
prizes 
and 
rewards 
of 
them 
are 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
people, 
or 
of 
great 
persons, 
who 
are 
but 
in 
very 
few 
cases 
even 
moderately 
learned. 
Moreover, 
this 
kind 
of 
progress 
is 
not 
only 
unrewarded 
with 
prizes 
and 
substantial 
benefits; 
it 
has 
not 
even 
the 
advantage 
of 
popular 
applause. 
For 
it 
is 
a 
greater 
matter 
than 
the 
generality 
of 
men 
can 
take 
in, 
and 
is 
apt 
to 
be 
overwhelmed 
and 
extinguished 
by 
the 
gales 
of 
popular 
opinions. 
And 
it 
is 
nothing 
strange 
if 
a 
thing 
not 
held 
in 
honor 
does 
not 
prosper. 


XCII 


But 
by 
far 
the 
greatest 
obstacle 
to 
the 
progress 
of 
science 
and 
to 
the 
undertaking 
of 
new 
tasks 
and 
provinces 
therein 
is 
found 
in 
this 
— 
that 
men 
despair 
and 
think 
things 
impossible. 
For 
wise 
and 
serious 
men 
are 
wont 
in 
these 
matters 
to 
be 
altogether 
distrustful, 
considering 
with 
themselves 
the 
obscurity 
of 
nature, 
the 
shortness 
of 
life, 
the 
deceitfulness 
of 
the 
senses, 
the 
weakness 
of 
the 
judgment, 
the 
difficulty 
of 
experiment, 
and 
the 
like; 
and 
so 
supposing 
that 
in 
the 
revolution 
of 
time 
and 
of 
the 
ages 
of 
the 
world 
the 



sciences 
have 
their 
ebbs 
and 
flows; 
that 
at 
one 
season 
they 
grow 
and 
flourish, 
at 
another 
wither 
and 
decay, 
yet 
in 
such 
sort 
that 
when 
they 
have 
reached 
a 
certain 
point 
and 
condition 
they 
can 
advance 
no 
further. 
If 
therefore 
anyone 
believes 
or 
promises 
more, 
they 
think 
this 
comes 
of 
an 
ungoverned 
and 
unripened 
mind, 
and 
that 
such 
attempts 
have 
prosperous 
beginnings, 
become 
difficult 
as 
they 
go 
on, 
and 
end 
in 
confusion. 
Now 
since 
these 
are 
thoughts 
which 
naturally 
present 
themselves 
to 
men 
grave 
and 
of 
great 
judgment, 
we 
must 
take 
good 
heed 
that 
we 
be 
not 
led 
away 
by 
our 
love 
for 
a 
most 
fair 
and 
excellent 
object 
to 
relax 
or 
diminish 
the 
severity 
of 
our 
judgment. 
We 
must 
observe 
diligently 
what 
encouragement 
dawns 
upon 
us 
and 
from 
what 
quarter, 
and, 
putting 
aside 
the 
lighter 
breezes 
of 
hope, 
we 
must 
thoroughly 
sift 
and 
examine 
those 
which 
promise 
greater 
steadiness 
and 
constancy. 
Nay, 
and 
we 
must 
take 
state 
prudence 
too 
into 
our 
counsels, 
whose 
rule 
is 
to 
distrust, 
and 
to 
take 
the 
less 
favorable 
view 
of 
human 
affairs. 
I 
am 
now 
therefore 
to 
speak 
touching 
hope, 
especially 
as 
I 
am 
not 
a 
dealer 
in 
promises, 
and 
wish 
neither 
to 
force 
nor 
to 
ensnare 
men's 
judgments, 
but 
to 
lead 
them 
by 
the 
hand 
with 
their 
good 
will. 
And 
though 
the 
strongest 
means 
of 
inspiring 
hope 
will 
be 
to 
bring 
men 
to 
particulars, 
especially 
to 
particulars 
digested 
and 
arranged 
in 
my 
Tables 
of 
Discovery 
(the 
subject 
partly 
of 
the 
second, 
but 
much 
more 
of 
the 
fourth 
part 
of 
my 
Instauration), 
since 
this 
is 
not 
merely 
the 
promise 
of 
the 
thing 
but 
the 
thing 
itself; 
nevertheless, 
that 
everything 
may 
be 
done 
with 
gentleness, 
I 
will 
proceed 
with 
my 
plan 
of 
preparing 
men's 
minds, 
of 
which 
preparation 
to 
give 
hope 
is 
no 
unimportant 
part. 
For 
without 
it 
the 
rest 
tends 
rather 
to 
make 
men 
sad 
(by 
giving 
them 
a 
worse 
and 
meaner 
opinion 
of 
things 
as 
they 
are 
than 
they 
now 
have, 
and 
making 
them 
more 
fully 
to 
feel 
and 
know 
the 
unhappiness 
of 
their 
own 
condition) 
than 
to 
induce 
any 
alacrity 
or 
to 
whet 
their 
industry 
in 
making 
trial. 
And 
therefore 
it 
is 
fit 
that 
I 
publish 
and 
set 
forth 
those 
conjectures 
of 
mine 
which 
make 
hope 
in 
this 
matter 
reasonable, 
just 
as 
Columbus 
did, 
before 
that 
wonderful 
voyage 
of 
his 
across 
the 
Atlantic, 
when 
he 
gave 
the 
reasons 
for 
his 
conviction 
that 
new 
lands 
and 
continents 
might 
be 
discovered 
besides 
those 
which 
were 
known 
before; 
which 
reasons, 
though 
rejected 
at 
first, 
were 
afterwards 
made 
good 
by 
experience, 
and 
were 
the 
causes 
and 
beginnings 
of 
great 
events. 


XCIII 


The 
beginning 
is 
from 
God: 
for 
the 
business 
which 
is 
in 
hand, 



having 
the 
character 
of 
good 
so 
strongly 
impressed 
upon 
it, 
appears 
manifestly 
to 
proceed 
from 
God, 
who 
is 
the 
author 
of 
good, 
and 
the 
Father 
of 
Lights. 
Now 
in 
divine 
operations 
even 
the 
smallest 
beginnings 
lead 
of 
a 
certainty 
to 
their 
end. 
And 
as 
it 
was 
said 
of 
spiritual 
things, 
"The 
kingdom 
of 
God 
cometh 
not 
with 
observation," 
so 
is 
it 
in 
all 
the 
greater 
works 
of 
Divine 
Providence; 
everything 
glides 
on 
smoothly 
and 
noiselessly, 
and 
the 
work 
is 
fairly 
going 
on 
before 
men 
are 
aware 
that 
it 
has 
begun. 
Nor 
should 
the 
prophecy 
of 
Daniel 
be 
forgotten 
touching 
the 
last 
ages 
of 
the 
world: 
"Many 
shall 
go 
to 
and 
fro, 
and 
knowledge 
shall 
be 
increased"; 
clearly 
intimating 
that 
the 
thorough 
passage 
of 
the 
world 
(which 
now 
by 
so 
many 
distant 
voyages 
seems 
to 
be 
accomplished, 
or 
in 
course 
of 
accomplishment), 
and 
the 
advancement 
of 
the 
sciences, 
are 
destined 
by 
fate, 
that 
is, 
by 
Divine 
Providence, 
to 
meet 
in 
the 
same 
age. 


XCIV 


Next 
comes 
a 
consideration 
of 
the 
greatest 
importance 
as 
an 
argument 
of 
hope; 
I 
mean 
that 
drawn 
from 
the 
errors 
of 
past 
time, 
and 
of 
the 
ways 
hitherto 
trodden. 
For 
most 
excellent 
was 
the 
censure 
once 
passed 
upon 
a 
government 
that 
had 
been 
unwisely 
administered. 
"That 
which 
is 
the 
worst 
thing 
in 
reference 
to 
the 
past, 
ought 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
best 
for 
the 
future. 
For 
if 
you 
had 
done 
all 
that 
your 
duty 
demanded, 
and 
yet 
your 
affairs 
were 
no 
better, 
you 
would 
not 
have 
even 
a 
hope 
left 
you 
that 
further 
improvement 
is 
possible. 
But 
now, 
when 
your 
misfortunes 
are 
owing, 
not 
to 
the 
force 
of 
circumstances, 
but 
to 
your 
own 
errors, 
you 
may 
hope 
that 
by 
dismissing 
or 
correcting 
these 
errors, 
a 
great 
change 
may 
be 
made 
for 
the 
better." 
In 
like 
manner, 
if 
during 
so 
long 
a 
course 
of 
years 
men 
had 
kept 
the 
true 
road 
for 
discovering 
and 
cultivating 
sciences, 
and 
had 
yet 
been 
unable 
to 
make 
further 
progress 
therein, 
bold 
doubtless 
and 
rash 
would 
be 
the 
opinion 
that 
further 
progress 
is 
possible. 
But 
if 
the 
road 
itself 
has 
been 
mistaken, 
and 
men's 
labor 
spent 
on 
unfit 
objects, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
difficulty 
has 
its 
rise 
not 
in 
things 
themselves, 
which 
are 
not 
in 
our 
power, 
but 
in 
the 
human 
understanding, 
and 
the 
use 
and 
application 
thereof, 
which 
admits 
of 
remedy 
and 
medicine. 
It 
will 
be 
of 
great 
use 
therefore 
to 
set 
forth 
what 
these 
errors 
are. 
For 
as 
many 
impediments 
as 
there 
have 
been 
in 
times 
past 
from 
this 
cause, 
so 
many 
arguments 
are 
there 
of 
hope 
for 
the 
time 
to 
come. 
And 
although 
they 
have 
been 
partly 
touched 
before, 
I 
think 
fit 
here 
also, 
in 
plain 
and 
simple 
words, 
to 



represent 
them. 


XCV 


Those 
who 
have 
handled 
sciences 
have 
been 
either 
men 
of 
experiment 
or 
men 
of 
dogmas. 
The 
men 
of 
experiment 
are 
like 
the 
ant, 
they 
only 
collect 
and 
use; 
the 
reasoners 
resemble 
spiders, 
who 
make 
cobwebs 
out 
of 
their 
own 
substance. 
But 
the 
bee 
takes 
a 
middle 
course: 
it 
gathers 
its 
material 
from 
the 
flowers 
of 
the 
garden 
and 
of 
the 
field, 
but 
transforms 
and 
digests 
it 
by 
a 
power 
of 
its 
own. 
Not 
unlike 
this 
is 
the 
true 
business 
of 
philosophy; 
for 
it 
neither 
relies 
solely 
or 
chiefly 
on 
the 
powers 
of 
the 
mind, 
nor 
does 
it 
take 
the 
matter 
which 
it 
gathers 
from 
natural 
history 
and 
mechanical 
experiments 
and 
lay 
it 
up 
in 
the 
memory 
whole, 
as 
it 
finds 
it, 
but 
lays 
it 
up 
in 
the 
understanding 
altered 
and 
digested. 
Therefore 
from 
a 
closer 
and 
purer 
league 
between 
these 
two 
faculties, 
the 
experimental 
and 
the 
rational 
(such 
as 
has 
never 
yet 
been 
made), 
much 
may 
be 
hoped. 


XCVI 


We 
have 
as 
yet 
no 
natural 
philosophy 
that 
is 
pure; 
all 
is 
tainted 
and 
corrupted: 
in 
Aristotle's 
school 
by 
logic; 
in 
Plato's 
by 
natural 
theology; 
in 
the 
second 
school 
of 
Platonists, 
such 
as 
Proclus 
and 
others, 
by 
mathematics, 
which 
ought 
only 
to 
give 
definiteness 
to 
natural 
philosophy, 
not 
to 
generate 
or 
give 
it 
birth. 
From 
a 
natural 
philosophy 
pure 
and 
unmixed, 
better 
things 
are 
to 
be 
expected. 


XCVII 


No 
one 
has 
yet 
been 
found 
so 
firm 
of 
mind 
and 
purpose 
as 
resolutely 
to 
compel 
himself 
to 
sweep 
away 
all 
theories 
and 
common 
notions, 
and 
to 
apply 
the 
understanding, 
thus 
made 
fair 
and 
even, 
to 
a 
fresh 
examination 
of 
particulars. 
Thus 
it 
happens 
that 
human 
knowledge, 
as 
we 
have 
it, 
is 
a 
mere 
medley 
and 
ill-digested 
mass, 
made 
up 
of 
much 
credulity 
and 
much 
accident, 
and 
also 
of 
the 
childish 
notions 
which 
we 
at 
first 
imbibed. 


Now 
if 
anyone 
of 
ripe 
age, 
unimpaired 
senses, 
and 
well-purged 



mind, 
apply 
himself 
anew 
to 
experience 
and 
particulars, 
better 
hopes 
may 
be 
entertained 
of 
that 
man. 
In 
which 
point 
I 
promise 
to 
myself 
a 
like 
fortune 
to 
that 
of 
Alexander 
the 
Great, 
and 
let 
no 
man 
tax 
me 
with 
vanity 
till 
he 
have 
heard 
the 
end; 
for 
the 
thing 
which 
I 
mean 
tends 
to 
the 
putting 
off 
of 
all 
vanity. 
For 
of 
Alexander 
and 
his 
deeds 
Aeschines 
spoke 
thus: 
"Assuredly 
we 
do 
not 
live 
the 
life 
of 
mortal 
men; 
but 
to 
this 
end 
were 
we 
born, 
that 
in 
after 
ages 
wonders 
might 
be 
told 
of 
us," 
as 
if 
what 
Alexander 
had 
done 
seemed 
to 
him 
miraculous. 
But 
in 
the 
next 
age 
Titus 
Livius 
took 
a 
better 
and 
a 
deeper 
view 
of 
the 
matter, 
saying 
in 
effect 
that 
Alexander 
"had 
done 
no 
more 
than 
take 
courage 
to 
despise 
vain 
apprehensions." 
And 
a 
like 
judgment 
I 
suppose 
may 
be 
passed 
on 
myself 
in 
future 
ages: 
that 
I 
did 
no 
great 
things, 
but 
simply 
made 
less 
account 
of 
things 
that 
were 
accounted 
great. 
In 
the 
meanwhile, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
said, 
there 
is 
no 
hope 
except 
in 
a 
new 
birth 
of 
science; 
that 
is, 
in 
raising 
it 
regularly 
up 
from 
experience 
and 
building 
it 
afresh, 
which 
no 
one 
(I 
think) 
will 
say 
has 
yet 
been 
done 
or 
thought 
of. 


XCVIII 


Now 
for 
grounds 
of 
experience 
— 
since 
to 
experience 
we 
must 
come 


— 
we 
have 
as 
yet 
had 
either 
none 
or 
very 
weak 
ones; 
no 
search 
has 
been 
made 
to 
collect 
a 
store 
of 
particular 
observations 
sufficient 
either 
in 
number, 
or 
in 
kind, 
or 
in 
certainty, 
to 
inform 
the 
understanding, 
or 
in 
any 
way 
adequate. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
men 
of 
learning, 
but 
easy 
withal 
and 
idle, 
have 
taken 
for 
the 
construction 
or 
for 
the 
confirmation 
of 
their 
philosophy 
certain 
rumors 
and 
vague 
fames 
or 
airs 
of 
experience, 
and 
allowed 
to 
these 
the 
weight 
of 
lawful 
evidence. 
And 
just 
as 
if 
some 
kingdom 
or 
state 
were 
to 
direct 
its 
counsels 
and 
affairs 
not 
by 
letters 
and 
reports 
from 
ambassadors 
and 
trustworthy 
messengers, 
but 
by 
the 
gossip 
of 
the 
streets; 
such 
exactly 
is 
the 
system 
of 
management 
introduced 
into 
philosophy 
with 
relation 
to 
experience. 
Nothing 
duly 
investigated, 
nothing 
verified, 
nothing 
counted, 
weighed, 
or 
measured, 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
natural 
history; 
and 
what 
in 
observation 
is 
loose 
and 
vague, 
is 
in 
information 
deceptive 
and 
treacherous. 
And 
if 
anyone 
thinks 
that 
this 
is 
a 
strange 
thing 
to 
say, 
and 
something 
like 
an 
unjust 
complaint, 
seeing 
that 
Aristotle, 
himself 
so 
great 
a 
man, 
and 
supported 
by 
the 
wealth 
of 
so 
great 
a 
king, 
has 
composed 
so 
accurate 
a 
history 
of 
animals; 
and 
that 
others 
with 
greater 
diligence, 
though 
less 
pretense, 
have 
made 
many 
additions; 
while 
others, 
again, 
have 
compiled 
copious 
histories 

and 
descriptions 
of 
metals, 
plants, 
and 
fossils; 
it 
seems 
that 
he 
does 
not 
rightly 
apprehend 
what 
it 
is 
that 
we 
are 
now 
about. 
For 
a 
natural 
history 
which 
is 
composed 
for 
its 
own 
sake 
is 
not 
like 
one 
that 
is 
collected 
to 
supply 
the 
understanding 
with 
information 
for 
the 
building 
up 
of 
philosophy. 
They 
differ 
in 
many 
ways, 
but 
especially 
in 
this: 
that 
the 
former 
contains 
the 
variety 
of 
natural 
species 
only, 
and 
not 
experiments 
of 
the 
mechanical 
arts. 
For 
even 
as 
in 
the 
business 
of 
life 
a 
man's 
disposition 
and 
the 
secret 
workings 
of 
his 
mind 
and 
affections 
are 
better 
discovered 
when 
he 
is 
in 
trouble 
than 
at 
other 
times, 
so 
likewise 
the 
secrets 
of 
nature 
reveal 
themselves 
more 
readily 
under 
the 
vexations 
of 
art 
than 
when 
they 
go 
their 
own 
way. 
Good 
hopes 
may 
therefore 
be 
conceived 
of 
natural 
philosophy, 
when 
natural 
history, 
which 
is 
the 
basis 
and 
foundation 
of 
it, 
has 
been 
drawn 
up 
on 
a 
better 
plan; 
but 
not 
till 
then. 


XCIX 


Again, 
even 
in 
the 
great 
plenty 
of 
mechanical 
experiments, 
there 
is 
yet 
a 
great 
scarcity 
of 
those 
which 
are 
of 
most 
use 
for 
the 
information 
of 
the 
understanding. 
For 
the 
mechanic, 
not 
troubling 
himself 
with 
the 
investigation 
of 
truth, 
confines 
his 
attention 
to 
those 
things 
which 
bear 
upon 
his 
particular 
work, 
and 
will 
not 
either 
raise 
his 
mind 
or 
stretch 
out 
his 
hand 
for 
anything 
else. 
But 
then 
only 
will 
there 
be 
good 
ground 
of 
hope 
for 
the 
further 
advance 
of 
knowledge 
when 
there 
shall 
be 
received 
and 
gathered 
together 
into 
natural 
history 
a 
variety 
of 
experiments 
which 
are 
of 
no 
use 
in 
themselves 
but 
simply 
serve 
to 
discover 
causes 
and 
axioms, 
which 
I 
call 
Experimenta 
lucifera 
, 
experiments 
of 
light 
, 
to 
distinguish 
them 
from 
those 
which 
I 
call 
fructifera 
, 
experiments 
of 
fruit 
. 


Now 
experiments 
of 
this 
kind 
have 
one 
admirable 
property 
and 
condition: 
they 
never 
miss 
or 
fail. 
For 
since 
they 
are 
applied, 
not 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
producing 
any 
particular 
effect, 
but 
only 
of 
discovering 
the 
natural 
cause 
of 
some 
effect, 
they 
answer 
the 
end 
equally 
well 
whichever 
way 
they 
turn 
out; 
for 
they 
settle 
the 
question. 


C 


But 
not 
only 
is 
a 
greater 
abundance 
of 
experiments 
to 
be 
sought 
for 



and 
procured, 
and 
that 
too 
of 
a 
different 
kind 
from 
those 
hitherto 
tried; 
an 
entirely 
different 
method, 
order, 
and 
process 
for 
carrying 
on 
and 
advancing 
experience 
must 
also 
be 
introduced. 
For 
experience, 
when 
it 
wanders 
in 
its 
own 
track, 
is, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
remarked, 
mere 
groping 
in 
the 
dark, 
and 
confounds 
men 
rather 
than 
instructs 
them. 
But 
when 
it 
shall 
proceed 
in 
accordance 
with 
a 
fixed 
law, 
in 
regular 
order, 
and 
without 
interruption, 
then 
may 
better 
things 
be 
hoped 
of 
knowledge. 


CI 


But 
even 
after 
such 
a 
store 
of 
natural 
history 
and 
experience 
as 
is 
required 
for 
the 
work 
of 
the 
understanding, 
or 
of 
philosophy, 
shall 
be 
ready 
at 
hand, 
still 
the 
understanding 
is 
by 
no 
means 
competent 
to 
deal 
with 
it 
offhand 
and 
by 
memory 
alone; 
no 
more 
than 
if 
a 
man 
should 
hope 
by 
force 
of 
memory 
to 
retain 
and 
make 
himself 
master 
of 
the 
computation 
of 
an 
ephemeris. 
And 
yet 
hitherto 
more 
has 
been 
done 
in 
matter 
of 
invention 
by 
thinking 
than 
by 
writing; 
and 
experience 
has 
not 
yet 
learned 
her 
letters. 
Now 
no 
course 
of 
invention 
can 
be 
satisfactory 
unless 
it 
be 
carried 
on 
in 
writing. 
But 
when 
this 
is 
brought 
into 
use, 
and 
experience 
has 
been 
taught 
to 
read 
and 
write, 
better 
things 
may 
be 
hoped. 


CII 


Moreover, 
since 
there 
is 
so 
great 
a 
number 
and 
army 
of 
particulars, 
and 
that 
army 
so 
scattered 
and 
dispersed 
as 
to 
distract 
and 
confound 
the 
understanding, 
little 
is 
to 
be 
hoped 
for 
from 
the 
skirmishings 
and 
slight 
attacks 
and 
desultory 
movements 
of 
the 
intellect, 
unless 
all 
the 
particulars 
which 
pertain 
to 
the 
subject 
of 
inquiry 
shall, 
by 
means 
of 
Tables 
of 
Discovery, 
apt, 
well 
arranged, 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
animate, 
be 
drawn 
up 
and 
marshaled; 
and 
the 
mind 
be 
set 
to 
work 
upon 
the 
helps 
duly 
prepared 
and 
digested 
which 
these 
tables 
supply. 


CIII 


But 
after 
this 
store 
of 
particulars 
has 
been 
set 
out 
duly 
and 
in 
order 
before 
our 
eyes, 
we 
are 
not 
to 
pass 
at 
once 
to 
the 
investigation 
and 
discovery 



of 
new 
particulars 
or 
works; 
or 
at 
any 
rate 
if 
we 
do 
so 
we 
must 
not 
stop 
there. 
For 
although 
I 
do 
not 
deny 
that 
when 
all 
the 
experiments 
of 
all 
the 
arts 
shall 
have 
been 
collected 
and 
digested, 
and 
brought 
within 
one 
man's 
knowledge 
and 
judgment, 
the 
mere 
transferring 
of 
the 
experiments 
of 
one 
art 
to 
others 
may 
lead, 
by 
means 
of 
that 
experience 
which 
I 
term 
literate, 
to 
the 
discovery 
of 
many 
new 
things 
of 
service 
to 
the 
life 
and 
state 
of 
man, 
yet 
it 
is 
no 
great 
matter 
that 
can 
be 
hoped 
from 
that; 
but 
from 
the 
new 
light 
of 
axioms, 
which 
having 
been 
educed 
from 
those 
particulars 
by 
a 
certain 
method 
and 
rule, 
shall 
in 
their 
turn 
point 
out 
the 
way 
again 
to 
new 
particulars, 
greater 
things 
may 
be 
looked 
for. 
For 
our 
road 
does 
not 
lie 
on 
a 
level, 
but 
ascends 
and 
descends; 
first 
ascending 
to 
axioms, 
then 
descending 
to 
works. 


CIV 


The 
understanding 
must 
not, 
however, 
be 
allowed 
to 
jump 
and 
fly 
from 
particulars 
to 
axioms 
remote 
and 
of 
almost 
the 
highest 
generality 
(such 
as 
the 
first 
principles, 
as 
they 
are 
called, 
of 
arts 
and 
things), 
and 
taking 
stand 
upon 
them 
as 
truths 
that 
cannot 
be 
shaken, 
proceed 
to 
prove 
and 
frame 
the 
middle 
axioms 
by 
reference 
to 
them; 
which 
has 
been 
the 
practice 
hitherto, 
the 
understanding 
being 
not 
only 
carried 
that 
way 
by 
a 
natural 
impulse, 
but 
also 
by 
the 
use 
of 
syllogistic 
demonstration 
trained 
and 
inured 
to 
it. 
But 
then, 
and 
then 
only, 
may 
we 
hope 
well 
of 
the 
sciences 
when 
in 
a 
just 
scale 
of 
ascent, 
and 
by 
successive 
steps 
not 
interrupted 
or 
broken, 
we 
rise 
from 
particulars 
to 
lesser 
axioms; 
and 
then 
to 
middle 
axioms, 
one 
above 
the 
other; 
and 
last 
of 
all 
to 
the 
most 
general. 
For 
the 
lowest 
axioms 
differ 
but 
slightly 
from 
bare 
experience, 
while 
the 
highest 
and 
most 
general 
(which 
we 
now 
have) 
are 
notional 
and 
abstract 
and 
without 
solidity. 
But 
the 
middle 
are 
the 
true 
and 
solid 
and 
living 
axioms, 
on 
which 
depend 
the 
affairs 
and 
fortunes 
of 
men; 
and 
above 
them 
again, 
last 
of 
all, 
those 
which 
are 
indeed 
the 
most 
general; 
such, 
I 
mean, 
as 
are 
not 
abstract, 
but 
of 
which 
those 
intermediate 
axioms 
are 
really 
limitations. 


The 
understanding 
must 
not 
therefore 
be 
supplied 
with 
wings, 
but 
rather 
hung 
with 
weights, 
to 
keep 
it 
from 
leaping 
and 
flying. 
Now 
this 
has 
never 
yet 
been 
done; 
when 
it 
is 
done, 
we 
may 
entertain 
better 
hopes 
of 
the 
sciences.

Aphorisms 


[Book 
Two] 


I 


On 
a 
given 
body, 
to 
generate 
and 
superinduce 
a 
new 
nature 
or 
new 
natures 
is 
the 
work 
and 
aim 
of 
human 
power. 
Of 
a 
given 
nature 
to 
discover 
the 
form, 
or 
true 
specific 
difference, 
or 
nature-engendering 
nature, 
or 
source 
of 
emanation 
(for 
these 
are 
the 
terms 
which 
come 
nearest 
to 
a 
description 
of 
the 
thing), 
is 
the 
work 
and 
aim 
of 
human 
knowledge. 
Subordinate 
to 
these 
primary 
works 
are 
two 
others 
that 
are 
secondary 
and 
of 
inferior 
mark: 
to 
the 
former, 
the 
transformation 
of 
concrete 
bodies, 
so 
far 
as 
this 
is 
possible; 
to 
the 
latter, 
the 
discovery, 
in 
every 
case 
of 
generation 
and 
motion, 
of 
the 
latent 
process 
carried 
on 
from 
the 
manifest 
efficient 
and 
the 
manifest 
material 
to 
the 
form 
which 
is 
engendered; 
and 
in 
like 
manner 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
latent 
configuration 
of 
bodies 
at 
rest 
and 
not 
in 
motion. 


II 


In 
what 
an 
ill 
condition 
human 
knowledge 
is 
at 
the 
present 
time 
is 
apparent 
even 
from 
the 
commonly 
received 
maxims. 
It 
is 
a 
correct 
position 
that 
"true 
knowledge 
is 
knowledge 
by 
causes." 
And 
causes 
again 
are 
not 
improperly 
distributed 
into 
four 
kinds: 
the 
material, 
the 
formal, 
the 
efficient, 
and 
the 
final. 
But 
of 
these 
the 
final 
cause 
rather 
corrupts 
than 
advances 
the 
sciences, 
except 
such 
as 
have 
to 
do 
with 
human 
action. 
The 
discovery 
of 
the 
formal 
is 
despaired 
of. 
The 
efficient 
and 
the 
material 
(as 
they 
are 
investigated 
and 
received, 
that 
is, 
as 
remote 
causes, 
without 
reference 
to 
the 
latent 
process 
leading 
to 
the 
form) 
are 
but 
slight 
and 
superficial, 
and 
contribute 
little, 
if 
anything, 
to 
true 
and 
active 
science. 
Nor 
have 
I 
forgotten 
that 
in 
a 
former 
passage 
I 
noted 
and 
corrected 
as 
an 
error 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
the 
opinion 
that 
forms 
give 
existence. 
For 
though 
in 
nature 
nothing 
really 
exists 
besides 
individual 
bodies, 
performing 
pure 
individual 
acts 
according 
to 
a 
fixed 
law, 



yet 
in 
philosophy 
this 
very 
law, 
and 
the 
investigation, 
discovery, 
and 
explanation 
of 
it, 
is 
the 
foundation 
as 
well 
of 
knowledge 
as 
of 
operation. 
And 
it 
is 
this 
law 
with 
its 
clauses 
that 
I 
mean 
when 
I 
speak 
of 
forms 
, 
a 
name 
which 
I 
the 
rather 
adopt 
because 
it 
has 
grown 
into 
use 
and 
become 
familiar. 


III 


If 
a 
man 
be 
acquainted 
with 
the 
cause 
of 
any 
nature 
(as 
whiteness 
or 
heat) 
in 
certain 
subjects 
only, 
his 
knowledge 
is 
imperfect; 
and 
if 
he 
be 
able 
to 
superinduce 
an 
effect 
on 
certain 
substances 
only 
(of 
those 
susceptible 
of 
such 
effect), 
his 
power 
is 
in 
like 
manner 
imperfect. 
Now 
if 
a 
man's 
knowledge 
be 
confined 
to 
the 
efficient 
and 
material 
causes 
(which 
are 
unstable 
causes, 
and 
merely 
vehicles, 
or 
causes 
which 
convey 
the 
form 
in 
certain 
cases) 
he 
may 
arrive 
at 
new 
discoveries 
in 
reference 
to 
substances 
in 
some 
degree 
similar 
to 
one 
another, 
and 
selected 
beforehand; 
but 
he 
does 
not 
touch 
the 
deeper 
boundaries 
of 
things. 
But 
whosoever 
is 
acquainted 
with 
forms 
embraces 
the 
unity 
of 
nature 
in 
substances 
the 
most 
unlike, 
and 
is 
able 
therefore 
to 
detect 
and 
bring 
to 
light 
things 
never 
yet 
done, 
and 
such 
as 
neither 
the 
vicissitudes 
of 
nature, 
nor 
industry 
in 
experimenting, 
nor 
accident 
itself, 
would 
ever 
have 
brought 
into 
act, 
and 
which 
would 
never 
have 
occurred 
to 
the 
thought 
of 
man. 
From 
the 
discovery 
of 
forms 
therefore 
results 
truth 
in 
speculation 
and 
freedom 
in 
operation. 


IV 


Although 
the 
roads 
to 
human 
power 
and 
to 
human 
knowledge 
lie 
close 
together 
and 
are 
nearly 
the 
same, 
nevertheless, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
pernicious 
and 
inveterate 
habit 
of 
dwelling 
on 
abstractions 
it 
is 
safer 
to 
begin 
and 
raise 
the 
sciences 
from 
those 
foundations 
which 
have 
relation 
to 
practice, 
and 
to 
let 
the 
active 
part 
itself 
be 
as 
the 
seal 
which 
prints 
and 
determines 
the 
contemplative 
counterpart. 
We 
must 
therefore 
consider, 
if 
a 
man 
wanted 
to 
generate 
and 
superinduce 
any 
nature 
upon 
a 
given 
body, 
what 
kind 
of 
rule 
or 
direction 
or 
guidance 
he 
would 
most 
wish 
for, 
and 
express 
the 
same 
in 
the 
simplest 
and 
least 
abstruse 
language. 
For 
instance, 
if 
a 
man 
wishes 
to 
superinduce 
upon 
silver 
that 
yellow 
color 
of 
gold 
or 
an 
increase 
of 
weight 
(observing 
the 
laws 
of 
matter), 
or 
transparency 
on 
an 
opaque 
stone, 
or 



tenacity 
on 
glass, 
or 
vegetation 
on 
some 
substance 
that 
is 
not 
vegetable 
— 
we 
must 
consider, 
I 
say, 
what 
kind 
of 
rule 
or 
guidance 
he 
would 
most 
desire. 
And 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
he 
will 
undoubtedly 
wish 
to 
be 
directed 
to 
something 
which 
will 
not 
deceive 
him 
in 
the 
result 
nor 
fail 
him 
in 
the 
trial. 
Secondly, 
he 
will 
wish 
for 
such 
a 
rule 
as 
shall 
not 
tie 
him 
down 
to 
certain 
means 
and 
particular 
modes 
of 
operation. 
For 
perhaps 
he 
may 
not 
have 
those 
means, 
nor 
be 
able 
conveniently 
to 
procure 
them. 
And 
if 
there 
be 
other 
means 
and 
other 
methods 
for 
producing 
the 
required 
nature 
(besides 
the 
one 
prescribed) 
these 
may 
perhaps 
be 
within 
his 
reach; 
and 
yet 
he 
shall 
be 
excluded 
by 
the 
narrowness 
of 
the 
rule, 
and 
get 
no 
good 
from 
them. 
Thirdly, 
he 
will 
desire 
something 
to 
be 
shown 
him, 
which 
is 
not 
as 
difficult 
as 
the 
thing 
proposed 
to 
be 
done, 
but 
comes 
nearer 
to 
practice. 


For 
a 
true 
and 
perfect 
rule 
of 
operation, 
then, 
the 
direction 
will 
be 
that 
it 
be 
certain, 
free, 
and 
disposing 
or 
leading 
to 
action 
. 
And 
this 
is 
the 
same 
thing 
with 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
true 
form. 
For 
the 
form 
of 
a 
nature 
is 
such, 
that 
given 
the 
form, 
the 
nature 
infallibly 
follows. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
always 
present 
when 
the 
nature 
is 
present, 
and 
universally 
implies 
it, 
and 
is 
constantly 
inherent 
in 
it. 
Again, 
the 
form 
is 
such 
that 
if 
it 
be 
taken 
away 
the 
nature 
infallibly 
vanishes. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
always 
absent 
when 
the 
nature 
is 
absent, 
and 
implies 
its 
absence, 
and 
inheres 
in 
nothing 
else. 
Lastly, 
the 
true 
form 
is 
such 
that 
it 
deduces 
the 
given 
nature 
from 
some 
source 
of 
being 
which 
is 
inherent 
in 
more 
natures, 
and 
which 
is 
better 
known 
in 
the 
natural 
order 
of 
things 
than 
the 
form 
itself. 
For 
a 
true 
and 
perfect 
axiom 
of 
knowledge, 
then, 
the 
direction 
and 
precept 
will 
be, 
that 
another 
nature 
be 
discovered 
which 
is 
convertible 
with 
the 
given 
nature 
and 
yet 
is 
a 
limitation 
of 
a 
more 
general 
nature, 
as 
of 
a 
true 
and 
real 
genus 
. 
Now 
these 
two 
directions, 
the 
one 
active 
the 
other 
contemplative, 
are 
one 
and 
the 
same 
thing; 
and 
what 
in 
operation 
is 
most 
useful, 
that 
in 
knowledge 
is 
most 
true. 


V 


The 
rule 
or 
axiom 
for 
the 
transformation 
of 
bodies 
is 
of 
two 
kinds. 
The 
first 
regards 
a 
body 
as 
a 
troop 
or 
collection 
of 
simple 
natures. 
In 
gold, 
for 
example, 
the 
following 
properties 
meet. 
It 
is 
yellow 
in 
color, 
heavy 
up 
to 
a 
certain 
weight, 
malleable 
or 
ductile 
to 
a 
certain 
degree 
of 
extension; 
it 
is 
not 
volatile 
and 
loses 
none 
of 
its 
substance 
by 
the 
action 
of 
fire; 
it 
turns 
into 
a 



liquid 
with 
a 
certain 
degree 
of 
fluidity; 
it 
is 
separated 
and 
dissolved 
by 
particular 
means; 
and 
so 
on 
for 
the 
other 
natures 
which 
meet 
in 
gold. 
This 
kind 
of 
axiom, 
therefore, 
deduces 
the 
thing 
from 
the 
forms 
of 
simple 
natures. 
For 
he 
who 
knows 
the 
forms 
of 
yellow, 
weight, 
ductility, 
fixity, 
fluidity, 
solution, 
and 
so 
on, 
and 
the 
methods 
for 
superinducing 
them 
and 
their 
gradations 
and 
modes, 
will 
make 
it 
his 
care 
to 
have 
them 
joined 
together 
in 
some 
body, 
whence 
may 
follow 
the 
transformation 
of 
that 
body 
into 
gold. 
And 
this 
kind 
of 
operation 
pertains 
to 
the 
first 
kind 
of 
action. 
For 
the 
principle 
of 
generating 
some 
one 
simple 
nature 
is 
the 
same 
as 
that 
of 
generating 
many; 
only 
that 
a 
man 
is 
more 
fettered 
and 
tied 
down 
in 
operation, 
if 
more 
are 
required, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
difficulty 
of 
combining 
into 
one 
so 
many 
natures 
which 
do 
not 
readily 
meet, 
except 
in 
the 
beaten 
and 
ordinary 
paths 
of 
nature. 
It 
must 
be 
said, 
however, 
that 
this 
mode 
of 
operation 
(which 
looks 
to 
simple 
natures 
though 
in 
a 
compound 
body) 
proceeds 
from 
what 
in 
nature 
is 
constant 
and 
eternal 
and 
universal, 
and 
opens 
broad 
roads 
to 
human 
power, 
such 
as 
(in 
the 
present 
state 
of 
things) 
human 
thought 
can 
scarcely 
comprehend 
or 
anticipate. 


The 
second 
kind 
of 
axiom, 
which 
is 
concerned 
with 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
latent 
process 
, 
proceeds 
not 
by 
simple 
natures, 
but 
by 
compound 
bodies, 
as 
they 
are 
found 
in 
nature 
in 
its 
ordinary 
course. 
As, 
for 
instance, 
when 
inquiry 
is 
made 
from 
what 
beginnings, 
and 
by 
what 
method 
and 
by 
what 
process, 
gold 
or 
any 
other 
metal 
or 
stone 
is 
generated, 
from 
its 
first 
menstrua 
and 
rudiments 
up 
to 
the 
perfect 
mineral; 
or 
in 
like 
manner, 
by 
what 
process 
herbs 
are 
generated, 
from 
the 
first 
concretion 
of 
juices 
in 
the 
ground 
or 
from 
seeds 
up 
to 
the 
formed 
plant, 
with 
all 
the 
successive 
motions 
and 
diverse 
and 
continued 
efforts 
of 
nature. 
So 
also 
in 
the 
inquiry 
concerning 
the 
process 
of 
development 
in 
the 
generation 
of 
animals, 
from 
coition 
to 
birth; 
and 
in 
like 
manner 
of 
other 
bodies. 


It 
is 
not 
however 
only 
to 
the 
generations 
of 
bodies 
that 
this 
investigation 
extends, 
but 
also 
to 
other 
motions 
and 
operations 
of 
nature. 
As, 
for 
instance, 
when 
inquiry 
is 
made 
concerning 
the 
whole 
course 
and 
continued 
action 
of 
nutrition, 
from 
the 
first 
reception 
of 
the 
food 
to 
its 
complete 
assimilation; 
or 
again, 
concerning 
the 
voluntary 
motion 
of 
animals 
from 
the 
first 
impression 
on 
the 
imagination 
and 
the 
continued 
efforts 
of 
the 
spirit 
up 
to 
the 
bendings 
and 
movements 
of 
the 
limbs; 
or 
concerning 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
tongue 
and 
lips 
and 
other 
instruments, 
and 
the 
changes 
through 



which 
it 
passes 
till 
it 
comes 
to 
the 
utterance 
of 
articulate 
sounds. 
For 
these 
inquiries 
also 
relate 
to 
natures 
concrete 
or 
combined 
into 
one 
structure, 
and 
have 
regard 
to 
what 
may 
be 
called 
particular 
and 
special 
habits 
of 
nature, 
not 
to 
her 
fundamental 
and 
universal 
laws 
which 
constitute 
forms. 
And 
yet 
it 
must 
be 
confessed 
that 
this 
plan 
appears 
to 
be 
readier 
and 
to 
lie 
nearer 
at 
hand 
and 
to 
give 
more 
ground 
for 
hope 
than 
the 
primary 
one. 


In 
like 
manner 
the 
operative 
which 
answers 
to 
this 
speculative 
part, 
starting 
from 
the 
ordinary 
incidents 
of 
nature, 
extends 
its 
operation 
to 
things 
immediately 
adjoining, 
or 
at 
least 
not 
far 
removed. 
But 
as 
for 
any 
profound 
and 
radical 
operations 
on 
nature, 
they 
depend 
entirely 
on 
the 
primary 
axioms. 
And 
in 
those 
things 
too 
where 
man 
has 
no 
means 
of 
operating, 
but 
only 
of 
knowing, 
as 
in 
the 
heavenly 
bodies 
(for 
these 
he 
cannot 
operate 
upon 
or 
change 
or 
transform), 
the 
investigation 
of 
the 
fact 
itself 
or 
truth 
of 
the 
thing, 
no 
less 
than 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
causes 
and 
consents, 
must 
come 
from 
those 
primary 
and 
catholic 
axioms 
concerning 
simple 
natures, 
such 
as 
the 
nature 
of 
spontaneous 
rotation, 
of 
attraction 
or 
magnetism, 
and 
of 
many 
others 
which 
are 
of 
a 
more 
general 
form 
than 
the 
heavenly 
bodies 
themselves. 
For 
let 
no 
one 
hope 
to 
decide 
the 
question 
whether 
it 
is 
the 
earth 
or 
heaven 
that 
really 
revolves 
in 
the 
diurnal 
motion 
until 
he 
has 
first 
comprehended 
the 
nature 
of 
spontaneous 
rotation. 


VI 


But 
this 
latent 
process 
of 
which 
I 
speak 
is 
quite 
another 
thing 
than 
men, 
preoccupied 
as 
their 
minds 
now 
are, 
will 
easily 
conceive. 
For 
what 
I 
understand 
by 
it 
is 
not 
certain 
measures 
or 
signs 
or 
successive 
steps 
of 
process 
in 
bodies, 
which 
can 
be 
seen; 
but 
a 
process 
perfectly 
continuous, 
which 
for 
the 
most 
part 
escapes 
the 
sense. 


For 
instance: 
in 
all 
generation 
and 
transformation 
of 
bodies, 
we 
must 
inquire 
what 
is 
lost 
and 
escapes; 
what 
remains, 
what 
is 
added; 
what 
is 
expanded, 
what 
contracted; 
what 
is 
united, 
what 
separated; 
what 
is 
continued, 
what 
cut 
off; 
what 
propels, 
what 
hinders; 
what 
predominates, 
what 
yields; 
and 
a 
variety 
of 
other 
particulars. 


Again, 
not 
only 
in 
the 
generation 
or 
transformation 
of 
bodies 
are 
these 
points 
to 
be 
ascertained, 
but 
also 
in 
all 
other 
alterations 
and 
motions 
it 



should 
in 
like 
manner 
be 
inquired 
what 
goes 
before, 
what 
comes 
after; 
what 
is 
quicker, 
what 
more 
tardy; 
what 
produces, 
what 
governs 
motion; 
and 
like 
points; 
all 
which 
nevertheless 
in 
the 
present 
state 
of 
the 
sciences 
(the 
texture 
of 
which 
is 
as 
rude 
as 
possible 
and 
good 
for 
nothing) 
are 
unknown 
and 
unhandled. 
For 
seeing 
that 
every 
natural 
action 
depends 
on 
things 
infinitely 
small, 
or 
at 
least 
too 
small 
to 
strike 
the 
sense, 
no 
one 
can 
hope 
to 
govern 
or 
change 
nature 
until 
he 
has 
duly 
comprehended 
and 
observed 
them. 


VII 


In 
like 
manner 
the 
investigation 
and 
discovery 
of 
the 
latent 
configuration 
in 
bodies 
is 
a 
new 
thing, 
no 
less 
than 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
latent 
process 
and 
of 
the 
form. 
For 
as 
yet 
we 
are 
but 
lingering 
in 
the 
outer 
courts 
of 
nature, 
nor 
are 
we 
preparing 
ourselves 
a 
way 
into 
her 
inner 
chambers. 
Yet 
no 
one 
can 
endow 
a 
given 
body 
with 
a 
new 
nature, 
or 
successfully 
and 
aptly 
transmute 
it 
into 
a 
new 
body, 
unless 
he 
has 
attained 
a 
competent 
knowledge 
of 
the 
body 
so 
to 
be 
altered 
or 
transformed. 
Otherwise 
he 
will 
run 
into 
methods 
which, 
if 
not 
useless, 
are 
at 
any 
rate 
difficult 
and 
perverse 
and 
unsuitable 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
body 
on 
which 
he 
is 
operating. 
It 
is 
clear 
therefore 
that 
to 
this 
also 
a 
way 
must 
be 
opened 
and 
laid 
out. 


And 
it 
is 
true 
that 
upon 
the 
anatomy 
of 
organized 
bodies 
(as 
of 
man 
and 
animals) 
some 
pains 
have 
been 
well 
bestowed 
and 
with 
good 
effect; 
and 
a 
subtle 
thing 
it 
seems 
to 
be, 
and 
a 
good 
scrutiny 
of 
nature. 
Yet 
this 
kind 
of 
anatomy 
is 
subject 
to 
sight 
and 
sense, 
and 
has 
place 
only 
in 
organized 
bodies. 
And 
besides 
it 
is 
a 
thing 
obvious 
and 
easy, 
when 
compared 
with 
the 
true 
anatomy 
of 
the 
latent 
configuration 
in 
bodies 
which 
are 
thought 
to 
be 
of 
uniform 
structure, 
especially 
in 
things 
and 
their 
parts 
that 
have 
a 
specific 
character, 
as 
iron, 
stone; 
and 
again 
in 
parts 
of 
uniform 
structure 
in 
plants 
and 
animals, 
as 
the 
root, 
the 
leaf, 
the 
flower, 
flesh, 
blood, 
and 
bones. 
But 
even 
in 
this 
kind, 
human 
industry 
has 
not 
been 
altogether 
wanting; 
for 
this 
is 
the 
very 
thing 
aimed 
at 
in 
the 
separation 
of 
bodies 
of 
uniform 
structure 
by 
means 
of 
distillations 
and 
other 
modes 
of 
analysis; 
that 
the 
complex 
structure 
of 
the 
compound 
may 
be 
made 
apparent 
by 
bringing 
together 
its 
several 
homogeneous 
parts. 
And 
this 
is 
of 
use 
too, 
and 
conduces 
to 
the 
object 
we 
are 
seeking, 
although 
too 
often 
fallacious 
in 
its 
results, 
because 
many 
natures 
which 
are 
in 
fact 
newly 
brought 
out 
and 
superinduced 
by 
fire 
and 
heat 
and 



other 
modes 
of 
solution 
are 
taken 
to 
be 
the 
effect 
of 
separation 
merely, 
and 
to 
have 
subsisted 
in 
the 
compound 
before. 
And 
after 
all, 
this 
is 
but 
a 
small 
part 
of 
the 
work 
of 
discovering 
the 
true 
configuration 
in 
the 
compound 
body; 
which 
configuration 
is 
a 
thing 
far 
more 
subtle 
and 
exact, 
and 
such 
as 
the 
operation 
of 
fire 
rather 
confounds 
than 
brings 
out 
and 
makes 
distinct. 


Therefore 
a 
separation 
and 
solution 
of 
bodies 
must 
be 
effected, 
not 
by 
fire 
indeed, 
but 
by 
reasoning 
and 
true 
induction, 
with 
experiments 
to 
aid; 
and 
by 
a 
comparison 
with 
other 
bodies, 
and 
a 
reduction 
to 
simple 
natures 
and 
their 
forms, 
which 
meet 
and 
mix 
in 
the 
compound. 
In 
a 
word, 
we 
must 
pass 
from 
Vulcan 
to 
Minerva 
if 
we 
intend 
to 
bring 
to 
light 
the 
true 
textures 
and 
configurations 
of 
bodies 
on 
which 
all 
the 
occult 
and, 
as 
they 
are 
called, 
specific 
properties 
and 
virtues 
in 
things 
depend, 
and 
from 
which, 
too, 
the 
rule 
of 
every 
powerful 
alteration 
and 
transformation 
is 
derived. 


For 
example, 
we 
must 
inquire 
what 
amount 
of 
spirit 
there 
is 
in 
every 
body, 
what 
of 
tangible 
essence; 
and 
of 
the 
spirit, 
whether 
it 
be 
copious 
and 
turgid, 
or 
meager 
and 
scarce; 
whether 
it 
be 
fine 
or 
coarse, 
akin 
to 
air 
or 
to 
fire, 
brisk 
or 
sluggish, 
weak 
or 
strong, 
progressive 
or 
retrograde, 
interrupted 
or 
continuous, 
agreeing 
with 
external 
and 
surrounding 
objects 
or 
disagreeing, 
etc. 
In 
like 
manner 
we 
must 
inquire 
into 
the 
tangible 
essence 
(which 
admits 
of 
no 
fewer 
differences 
than 
the 
spirit), 
into 
its 
coats, 
its 
fibers, 
its 
kinds 
of 
texture. 
Moreover, 
the 
disposition 
of 
the 
spirit 
throughout 
the 
corporeal 
frame, 
with 
its 
pores, 
passages, 
veins 
and 
cells, 
and 
the 
rudiments 
or 
first 
essays 
of 
the 
organized 
body, 
falls 
under 
the 
same 
investigation. 
But 
on 
these 
inquiries 
also, 
and 
I 
may 
say 
on 
all 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
latent 
configuration, 
a 
true 
and 
clear 
light 
is 
shed 
by 
the 
primary 
axioms 
which 
entirely 
dispels 
darkness 
and 
subtlety. 


VIII 


Nor 
shall 
we 
thus 
be 
led 
to 
the 
doctrine 
of 
atoms, 
which 
implies 
the 
hypothesis 
of 
a 
vacuum 
and 
that 
of 
the 
unchangeableness 
of 
matter 
(both 
false 
assumptions); 
we 
shall 
be 
led 
only 
to 
real 
particles, 
such 
as 
really 
exist. 
Nor 
again 
is 
there 
any 
reason 
to 
be 
alarmed 
at 
the 
subtlety 
of 
the 
investigation, 
as 
if 
it 
could 
not 
be 
disentangled. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
nearer 
it 
approaches 
to 
simple 
natures, 
the 
easier 
and 
plainer 
will 
everything 
become, 
the 
business 
being 
transferred 
from 
the 
complicated 
to 
the 
simple; 
from 
the 



incommensurable 
to 
the 
commensurable; 
from 
surds 
to 
rational 
quantities; 
from 
the 
infinite 
and 
vague 
to 
the 
finite 
and 
certain; 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
letters 
of 
the 
alphabet 
and 
the 
notes 
of 
music. 
And 
inquiries 
into 
nature 
have 
the 
best 
result 
when 
they 
begin 
with 
physics 
and 
end 
in 
mathematics. 
Again, 
let 
no 
one 
be 
afraid 
of 
high 
numbers 
or 
minute 
fractions. 
For 
in 
dealing 
with 
numbers 
it 
is 
as 
easy 
to 
set 
down 
or 
conceive 
a 
thousand 
as 
one, 
or 
the 
thousandth 
part 
of 
an 
integer 
as 
an 
integer 
itself. 


IX 


From 
the 
two 
kinds 
of 
axioms 
which 
have 
been 
spoken 
of 
arises 
a 
just 
division 
of 
philosophy 
and 
the 
sciences, 
taking 
the 
received 
terms 
(which 
come 
nearest 
to 
express 
the 
thing) 
in 
a 
sense 
agreeable 
to 
my 
own 
views. 
Thus, 
let 
the 
investigation 
of 
forms, 
which 
are 
(in 
the 
eye 
of 
reason 
at 
least, 
and 
in 
their 
essential 
law) 
eternal 
and 
immutable, 
constitute 
Metaphysics 
; 
and 
let 
the 
investigation 
of 
the 
efficient 
cause, 
and 
of 
matter, 
and 
of 
the 
latent 
process, 
and 
the 
latent 
configuration 
(all 
of 
which 
have 
reference 
to 
the 
common 
and 
ordinary 
course 
of 
nature, 
not 
to 
her 
eternal 
and 
fundamental 
laws) 
constitute 
Physics 
. 
And 
to 
these 
let 
there 
be 
subordinate 
two 
practical 
divisions: 
to 
Physics, 
Mechanics 
; 
to 
Metaphysics, 
what 
(in 
a 
purer 
sense 
of 
the 
word) 
I 
call 
Magic 
, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
broadness 
of 
the 
ways 
it 
moves 
in, 
and 
its 
greater 
command 
over 
nature. 


X 


Having 
thus 
set 
up 
the 
mark 
of 
knowledge, 
we 
must 
go 
on 
to 
precepts, 
and 
that 
in 
the 
most 
direct 
and 
obvious 
order. 
Now 
my 
directions 
for 
the 
interpretation 
of 
nature 
embrace 
two 
generic 
divisions: 
the 
one 
how 
to 
educe 
and 
form 
axioms 
from 
experience; 
the 
other 
how 
to 
deduce 
and 
derive 
new 
experiments 
from 
axioms. 
The 
former 
again 
is 
divided 
into 
three 
ministrations: 
a 
ministration 
to 
the 
sense, 
a 
ministration 
to 
the 
memory, 
and 
a 
ministration 
to 
the 
mind 
or 
reason. 


For 
first 
of 
all 
we 
must 
prepare 
a 
natural 
and 
experimental 
history, 
sufficient 
and 
good; 
and 
this 
is 
the 
foundation 
of 
all, 
for 
we 
are 
not 
to 
imagine 
or 
suppose, 
but 
to 
discover, 
what 
nature 
does 
or 
may 
be 
made 
to 
do. 



But 
natural 
and 
experimental 
history 
is 
so 
various 
and 
diffuse 
that 
it 
confounds 
and 
distracts 
the 
understanding, 
unless 
it 
be 
ranged 
and 
presented 
to 
view 
in 
a 
suitable 
order. 
We 
must 
therefore 
form 
tables 
and 
arrangements 
of 
instances, 
in 
such 
a 
method 
and 
order 
that 
the 
understanding 
may 
be 
able 
to 
deal 
with 
them. 


And 
even 
when 
this 
is 
done, 
still 
the 
understanding, 
if 
left 
to 
itself 
and 
its 
own 
spontaneous 
movements, 
is 
incompetent 
and 
unfit 
to 
form 
axioms, 
unless 
it 
be 
directed 
and 
guarded. 
Therefore 
in 
the 
third 
place 
we 
must 
use 
induction, 
true 
and 
legitimate 
induction, 
which 
is 
the 
very 
key 
of 
interpretation. 
But 
of 
this, 
which 
is 
the 
last, 
I 
must 
speak 
first, 
and 
then 
go 
back 
to 
the 
other 
ministrations. 


XI 


The 
investigation 
of 
forms 
proceeds 
thus: 
a 
nature 
being 
given, 
we 
must 
first 
of 
all 
have 
a 
muster 
or 
presentation 
before 
the 
understanding 
of 
all 
known 
instances 
which 
agree 
in 
the 
same 
nature, 
though 
in 
substances 
the 
most 
unlike. 
And 
such 
collection 
must 
be 
made 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
a 
history, 
without 
premature 
speculation, 
or 
any 
great 
amount 
of 
subtlety. 
For 
example, 
let 
the 
investigation 
be 
into 
the 
form 
of 
heat. 


Instances 
Agreeing 
in 
the 
Nature 
of 
Heat 


1. 
The 
rays 
of 
the 
sun, 
especially 
in 
summer 
and 
at 
noon. 
2. 
The 
rays 
of 
the 
sun 
reflected 
and 
condensed, 
as 
between 
mountains, 
or 
on 
walls, 
and 
most 
of 
all 
in 
burning 
glasses 
and 
mirrors. 
3. 
Fiery 
meteors. 
4. 
Burning 
thunderbolts. 
5. 
Eruptions 
of 
flame 
from 
the 
cavities 
of 
mountains. 
6. 
All 
flame. 
7. 
Ignited 
solids. 
8. 
Natural 
warm 
baths. 
9. 
Liquids 
boiling 
or 
heated. 

10. 
Hot 
vapors 
and 
fumes, 
and 
the 
air 
itself, 
which 
conceives 
the 
most 
powerful 
and 
glowing 
heat 
if 
confined, 
as 
in 
reverbatory 
furnaces. 
11. 
Certain 
seasons 
that 
are 
fine 
and 
cloudless 
by 
the 
constitution 
of 
the 
air 
itself, 
without 
regard 
to 
the 
time 
of 
year. 
12. 
Air 
confined 
and 
underground 
in 
some 
caverns, 
especially 
in 
winter. 
13. 
All 
villous 
substances, 
as 
wool, 
skins 
of 
animals, 
and 
down 
of 
birds, 
have 
heat. 
14. 
All 
bodies, 
whether 
solid 
or 
liquid, 
whether 
dense 
or 
rare 
(as 
the 
air 
itself 
is), 
held 
for 
a 
time 
near 
the 
fire. 
15. 
Sparks 
struck 
from 
flint 
and 
steel 
by 
strong 
percussion. 
16. 
All 
bodies 
rubbed 
violently, 
as 
stone, 
wood, 
cloth, 
etc., 
insomuch 
that 
poles 
and 
axles 
of 
wheels 
sometimes 
catch 
fire; 
and 
the 
way 
they 
kindled 
fire 
in 
the 
West 
Indies 
was 
by 
attrition. 
17. 
Green 
and 
moist 
vegetables 
confined 
and 
bruised 
together, 
as 
roses 
packed 
in 
baskets; 
insomuch 
that 
hay, 
if 
damp, 
when 
stacked, 
often 
catches 
fire. 
18. 
Quicklime 
sprinkled 
with 
water. 
19. 
Iron, 
when 
first 
dissolved 
by 
strong 
waters 
in 
glass, 
and 
that 
without 
being 
put 
near 
the 
fire. 
And 
in 
like 
manner 
tin, 
etc., 
but 
not 
with 
equal 
intensity. 
20. 
Animals, 
especially 
and 
at 
all 
times 
internally; 
though 
in 
insects 
the 
heat 
is 
not 
perceptible 
to 
the 
touch 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
smallness 
of 
their 
size. 
21. 
Horse 
dung 
and 
like 
excrements 
of 
animals, 
when 
fresh. 
22. 
Strong 
oil 
of 
sulphur 
and 
of 
vitriol 
has 
the 
effect 
of 
heat 
in 
burning 
linen. 
23. 
Oil 
of 
marjoram 
and 
similar 
oils 
have 
the 
effect 
of 
heat 
in 
burning 
the 
bones 
of 
the 
teeth. 
24. 
Strong 
and 
well 
rectified 
spirit 
of 
wine 
has 
the 
effect 
of 
heat, 
insomuch 
that 
the 
white 
of 
an 
egg 
being 
put 
into 
it 
hardens 
and 
whitens 

almost 
as 
if 
it 
were 
boiled, 
and 
bread 
thrown 
in 
becomes 
dry 
and 
crusted 
like 
toast. 


25. 
Aromatic 
and 
hot 
herbs, 
as 
dracunculus, 
nasturtium 
vetus 
, 
etc., 
although 
not 
warm 
to 
the 
hand 
(either 
whole 
or 
in 
powder), 
yet 
to 
the 
tongue 
and 
palate, 
being 
a 
little 
masticated, 
they 
feel 
hot 
and 
burning. 
26. 
Strong 
vinegar, 
and 
all 
acids, 
on 
all 
parts 
of 
the 
body 
where 
there 
is 
no 
epidermis, 
as 
the 
eye, 
tongue, 
or 
on 
any 
part 
when 
wounded 
and 
laid 
bare 
of 
the 
skin, 
produce 
a 
pain 
but 
little 
differing 
from 
that 
which 
is 
created 
by 
heat. 
27. 
Even 
keen 
and 
intense 
cold 
produces 
a 
kind 
of 
sensation 
of 
burning: 
"Nec 
Boreæ 
penetrabile 
frigus 
adurit." 
1 
28. 
Other 
instances. 
This 
table 
I 
call 
the 
Table 
of 
Essence 
and 
Presence 
. 


l 
Nor 
burns 
the 
sharp 
cold 
of 
the 
northern 
blast. 


XII 


Secondly, 
we 
must 
make 
a 
presentation 
to 
the 
understanding 
of 
instances 
in 
which 
the 
given 
nature 
is 
wanting; 
because 
the 
form, 
as 
stated 
above, 
ought 
no 
less 
to 
be 
absent 
when 
the 
given 
nature 
is 
absent, 
than 
present 
when 
it 
is 
present. 
But 
to 
note 
all 
these 
would 
be 
endless. 


The 
negatives 
should 
therefore 
be 
subjoined 
to 
the 
affirmatives,

the 
absence 
of 
the

nature 
inquired 
of 
in 
those 
subjects 
only 
that 
are 
most 
akin 
to 
the 
others 
in 
which 
it 
is 
present 
and 
forthcoming. 
This 
I 
call 
the 
Table 
of 
Deviation, 
or 
of 
Absence 
in 
Proximity 
. 


Instances 
in 
Proximity 
where 
the 
Nature 
of 
Heat 
is 
Absent 


Answering 
to 
the 
first 
affirmative 
instance 
. 


1. 
The 
rays 
of 
the 
moon 
and 
of 
stars 
and 
comets 
are 
not 
found 
to 
be 
hot 
to 
the 
touch; 
indeed 
the 
severest 
colds 
are 
observed 
to 
be 
at 
the 
full 
moons. 
The 
larger 
fixed 
stars, 
however, 
when 
passed 
or 
approached 
by 
the 
sun, 
are 
supposed 
to 
increase 
and 
give 
intensity 
to 
the 
heat 
of 
the 
sun, 
as 
is 



the 
case 
when 
the 
sun 
is 
in 
the 
sign 
Leo, 
and 
in 
the 
dog 
days. 


To 
the 
2nd 
. 


2. 
The 
rays 
of 
the 
sun 
in 
what 
is 
called 
the 
middle 
region 
of 
the 
air 
do 
not 
give 
heat; 
for 
which 
there 
is 
commonly 
assigned 
not 
a 
bad 
reason, 
viz., 
that 
that 
region 
is 
neither 
near 
enough 
to 
the 
body 
of 
the 
sun 
from 
which 
the 
rays 
emanate, 
nor 
to 
the 
earth 
from 
which 
they 
are 
reflected. 
And 
this 
appears 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
on 
the 
tops 
of 
mountains, 
unless 
they 
are 
very 
high, 
there 
is 
perpetual 
snow. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
has 
been 
observed 
that 
on 
the 
Peak 
of 
Tenerife, 
and 
among 
the 
Andes 
of 
Peru, 
the 
very 
tops 
of 
the 
mountains 
are 
free 
from 
snow, 
which 
lies 
only 
somewhat 
lower 
down. 
Moreover, 
the 
air 
itself 
at 
the 
very 
top 
is 
found 
to 
be 
by 
no 
means 
cold, 
but 
only 
rare 
and 
keen; 
insomuch 
that 
on 
the 
Andes 
it 
pricks 
and 
hurts 
the 
eyes 
by 
its 
excessive 
keenness, 
and 
also 
irritates 
the 
mouth 
of 
the 
stomach, 
producing 
vomiting. 
And 
it 
was 
observed 
by 
the 
ancients 
that 
on 
the 
top 
of 
Olympus 
the 
rarity 
of 
the 
air 
was 
such 
that 
those 
who 
ascended 
it 
had 
to 
carry 
sponges 
with 
them 
dipped 
in 
vinegar 
and 
water, 
and 
to 
apply 
them 
from 
time 
to 
time 
to 
the 
mouth 
and 
nose, 
the 
air 
being 
from 
its 
rarity 
not 
sufficient 
to 
support 
respiration; 
and 
it 
was 
further 
stated 
that 
on 
this 
summit 
the 
air 
was 
so 
serene, 
and 
so 
free 
from 
rain 
and 
snow 
and 
wind, 
that 
letters 
traced 
by 
the 
finger 
in 
the 
ashes 
of 
the 
sacrifices 
on 
the 
altar 
of 
Jupiter 
remained 
there 
still 
the 
next 
year 
without 
being 
at 
all 
disturbed. 
And 
at 
this 
day 
travelers 
ascending 
to 
the 
top 
of 
the 
Peak 
of 
Tenerife 
make 
the 
ascent 
by 
night 
and 
not 
by 
day, 
and 
soon 
after 
the 
rising 
of 
the 
sun 
are 
warned 
and 
urged 
by 
their 
guides 
to 
come 
down 
without 
delay, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
danger 
they 
run 
lest 
the 
animal 
spirits 
should 
swoon 
and 
be 
suffocated 
by 
the 
tenuity 
of 
the 
air. 
To 
the 
2nd 
.

The 
reflection 
of 
the 
rays 
of 
the 
sun 
in 
regions 
near 
the 
polar 
circles 
is 
found 
to 
be 
very 
weak 
and 
ineffective 
in 
producing 
heat, 
insomuch 
that 
the 
Dutch 
who 
wintered 
in 
Nova 
Zembla 
and 
expected 
their 
ship 
to 
be 
freed 
from 
the 
obstructions 
of 
the 
mass 
of 
ice 
which 
hemmed 
her 
in 
by 
the 
beginning 
of 
July, 
were 
disappointed 
in 
their 
expectation 
and 
obliged 
to 
take 
to 
their 
boat. 
Thus 
the 
direct 
rays 
of 
the 
sun 
seem 
to 
have 
but 
little 
power, 
even 
on 
the 
level 
ground; 
nor 
have 
the 
reflex 
much, 
unless 
they 
are 
multiplied 
and 
combined, 
which 
is 
the 
case 
when 
the 
sun 
tends 
more 
to 
the 
perpendicular, 
for 
then 
the 
incident 
rays 
make 
acuter 
angles, 
so 
that 
the 
lines 

of 
the 
rays 
are 
nearer 
each 
other; 
whereas 
on 
the 
contrary, 
when 
the 
sun 
shines 
very 
obliquely, 
the 
angles 
are 
very 
obtuse, 
and 
thus 
the 
lines 
of 
rays 
are 
at 
a 
greater 
distance 
from 
each 
other. 
Meanwhile, 
it 
should 
be 
observed 
that 
there 
may 
be 
many 
operations 
of 
the 
sun, 
and 
those 
too 
depending 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
heat, 
which 
are 
not 
proportioned 
to 
our 
touch, 
so 
that 
in 
respect 
to 
us 
their 
action 
does 
not 
go 
so 
far 
as 
to 
produce 
sensible 
warmth, 
but 
in 
respect 
to 
some 
other 
bodies 
they 
have 
the 
effect 
of 
heat. 


4. 
Try 
the 
following 
experiment. 
Take 
a 
glass 
fashioned 
in 
a 
contrary 
manner 
to 
a 
common 
burning 
glass 
and, 
placing 
it 
between 
your 
hand 
and 
the 
rays 
of 
the 
sun, 
observe 
whether 
it 
diminishes 
the 
heat 
of 
the 
sun, 
as 
a 
burning 
glass 
increases 
and 
strengthens 
it. 
For 
it 
is 
evident 
in 
the 
case 
of 
optical 
rays 
that 
according 
as 
the 
glass 
is 
made 
thicker 
or 
thinner 
in 
the 
middle 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
sides, 
so 
do 
the 
objects 
seen 
through 
it 
appear 
more 
spread 
or 
more 
contracted. 
Observe 
therefore 
whether 
the 
same 
is 
the 
case 
with 
heat. 
To 
the 
2nd 


5. 
Let 
the 
experiment 
be 
carefully 
tried, 
whether 
by 
means 
of 
the 
most 
powerful 
and 
best 
constructed 
burning 
glasses, 
the 
rays 
of 
the 
moon 
can 
be 
so 
caught 
and 
collected 
as 
to 
produce 
even 
the 
last 
degree 
of 
warmth. 
But 
should 
this 
degree 
of 
warmth 
prove 
too 
subtle 
and 
weak 
to 
be 
perceived 
and 
apprehended 
by 
the 
touch, 
recourse 
must 
be 
had 
to 
those 
glasses 
which 
indicate 
the 
state 
of 
the 
atmosphere 
in 
respect 
to 
heat 
and 
cold. 
Thus, 
let 
the 
rays 
of 
the 
moon 
fall 
through 
a 
burning 
glass 
on 
the 
top 
of 
a 
glass 
of 
this 
kind, 
and 
then 
observe 
whether 
there 
ensues 
a 
sinking 
of 
the 
water 
through 
warmth. 
To 
the 
2nd 
. 


6. 
Let 
a 
burning 
glass 
also 
be 
tried 
with 
a 
heat 
that 
does 
not 
emit 
rays 
or 
light, 
as 
that 
of 
iron 
or 
stone 
heated 
but 
not 
ignited, 
boiling 
water, 
and 
the 
like; 
and 
observe 
whether 
there 
ensue 
an 
increase 
of 
the 
heat, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
sun's 
rays. 
To 
the 
2nd 
. 


7. 
Let 
a 
burning 
glass 
also 
be 
tried 
with 
common 
flame. 
To 
the 
2nd 
.

Comets 
(if 
we 
are 
to 
reckon 
these 
too 
among 
meteors) 
are 
not 
found 
to 
exert 
a 
constant 
or 
manifest 
effect 
in 
increasing 
the 
heat 
of 
the 
season, 
though 
it 
is 
observed 
that 
they 
are 
often 
followed 
by 
droughts. 
Moreover 
bright 
beams 
and 
pillars 
and 
openings 
in 
the 
heavens 
appear 
more 
frequently 
in 
winter 
than 
in 
summertime, 
and 
chiefly 
during 
the 
intensest 
cold, 
but 
always 
accompanied 
by 
dry 
weather. 
Lightning, 
however, 
and 
coruscations 
and 
thunder 
seldom 
occur 
in 
the 
winter, 
but 
about 
the 
time 
of 
great 
heat. 
Falling 
stars, 
as 
they 
are 
called, 
are 
commonly 
supposed 
to 
consist 
rather 
of 
some 
bright 
and 
lighted 
viscous 
substance, 
than 
to 
be 
of 
any 
strong 
fiery 
nature. 
But 
on 
this 
point 
let 
further 
inquiry 
be 
made. 
To 
the 
3rd 
. 


9. 
There 
are 
certain 
coruscations 
which 
give 
light 
but 
do 
not 
burn. 
And 
these 
always 
come 
without 
thunder. 
To 
the 
4th 
.

Eructations 
and 
eruptions 
of 
flame 
are 
found 
no 
less 
in 
cold 
than 
in 
warm 
countries, 
as 
in 
Iceland 
and 
Greenland. 
In 
cold 
countries, 
too, 
the 
trees 
are 
in 
many 
cases 
more 
inflammable 
and 
more 
pitchy 
and 
resinous 
than 
in 
warm; 
as 
the 
fir, 
pine, 
and 
others. 
The 
situations 
however 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
soil 
in 
which 
eruptions 
of 
this 
kind 
usually 
occur 
have 
not 
been 
carefully 
enough 
ascertained 
to 
enable 
us 
to 
subjoin 
a 
negative 
to 
this 
affirmative 
instance. 
To 
the 
5th 
. 


11. 
All 
flame 
is 
in 
all 
cases 
more 
or 
less 
warm; 
nor 
is 
there 
any 
negative 
to 
be 
subjoined. 
And 
yet 
they 
say 
that 
the 
ignis 
fatuus 
(as 
it 
is 
called), 
which 
sometimes 
even 
settles 
on 
a 
wall, 
has 
not 
much 
heat, 
perhaps 
as 
much 
as 
the 
flame 
of 
spirit 
of 
wine, 
which 
is 
mild 
and 
soft. 
But 
still 
milder 
must 
that 
flame 
be 
which, 
according 
to 
certain 
grave 
and 
trustworthy 
histories 
has 
been 
seen 
shining 
about 
the 
head 
and 
locks 
of 
boys 
and 
girls, 
without 
at 
all 
burning 
the 
hair, 
but 
softly 
playing 
round 
it. 
It 
is 
also 
most 
certain 
that 
about 
a 
horse, 
when 
sweating 
on 
the 
road, 
there 
is 
sometimes 
seen 
at 
night, 
and 
in 
clear 
weather, 
a 
sort 
of 
luminous 
appearance 
without 
any 
manifest 
heat. 
And 
it 
is 
a 
well-known 
fact, 
and 
looked 
upon 
as 
a 
sort 
of 
miracle, 
that 
a 
few 
years 
ago 
a 
girl's 
stomacher, 
on 
being 
slightly 
shaken 
or 
rubbed, 
emitted 
sparks, 
which 
was 
caused 
perhaps 
by 
some 
alum 
or 
salts 

used 
in 
the 
dye, 
that 
stood 
somewhat 
thick 
and 
formed 
a 
crust, 
and 
were 
broken 
by 
the 
friction. 
It 
is 
also 
most 
certain 
that 
all 
sugar, 
whether 
refined 
or 
raw, 
provided 
only 
it 
be 
somewhat 
hard, 
sparkles 
when 
broken 
or 
scraped 
with 
a 
knife 
in 
the 
dark. 
In 
like 
manner 
sea 
and 
salt 
water 
is 
sometimes 
found 
to 
sparkle 
by 
night 
when 
struck 
violently 
by 
oars. 
And 
in 
storms, 
too, 
at 
nighttime, 
the 
foam 
of 
the 
sea 
when 
violently 
agitated 
emits 
sparks, 
and 
this 
sparkling 
the 
Spaniards 
call 
Sea 
Lung 
. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
heat 
of 
the 
flame 
which 
was 
called 
by 
ancient 
sailors 
Castor 
and 
Pollux, 
and 
by 
moderns 
St. 
Elmo's 
Fire, 
no 
sufficient 
investigation 
thereof 
has 
been 
made. 


To 
the 
6th 
. 


12. 
Every 
body 
ignited 
so 
as 
to 
turn 
to 
a 
fiery 
red, 
even 
if 
unaccompanied 
by 
flame, 
is 
always 
hot; 
neither 
is 
there 
any 
negative 
to 
be 
subjoined 
to 
this 
affirmative. 
But 
that 
which 
comes 
nearest 
seems 
to 
be 
rotten 
wood, 
which 
shines 
by 
night 
and 
yet 
is 
not 
found 
to 
be 
hot; 
and 
the 
putrefying 
scales 
of 
fish, 
which 
also 
shine 
in 
the 
dark 
and 
yet 
are 
not 
warm 
to 
the 
touch; 
nor, 
again, 
is 
the 
body 
of 
the 
glowworm, 
or 
of 
the 
fly 
called 
Luciola 
, 
found 
to 
be 
warm 
to 
the 
touch. 
To 
the 
7th 
. 


13. 
In 
what 
situation 
and 
kind 
of 
soil 
warm 
baths 
usually 
spring 
has 
not 
been 
sufficiently 
examined; 
and 
therefore 
no 
negative 
is 
subjoined. 
To 
the 
8th 
. 


14. 
To 
warm 
liquids 
I 
subjoin 
the 
negative 
instance 
of 
liquid 
itself 
in 
its 
natural 
state. 
For 
we 
find 
no 
tangible 
liquid 
which 
is 
warm 
in 
its 
own 
nature 
and 
remains 
so 
constantly; 
but 
the 
warmth 
is 
of 
an 
adventitious 
nature, 
superinduced 
only 
for 
the 
time 
being, 
so 
that 
the 
liquids 
which 
in 
power 
and 
operation 
are 
hottest, 
as 
spirit 
of 
wine, 
chemical 
oil 
of 
spices, 
oil 
of 
vitriol 
and 
sulphur, 
and 
the 
like, 
which 
burn 
after 
a 
while, 
are 
at 
first 
cold 
to 
the 
touch. 
The 
water 
of 
natural 
warm 
baths, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
if 
received 
into 
a 
vessel 
and 
separated 
from 
its 
springs, 
cools 
just 
like 
water 
that 
has 
been 
heated 
on 
a 
fire. 
But 
it 
is 
true 
that 
oily 
substances 
are 
less 
cold 
to 
the 
touch 
than 
watery, 
oil 
being 
less 
cold 
than 
water, 
and 
silk 
than 
linen. 
But 
this 
belongs 
to 
the 
Table 
of 
Degrees 
of 
Cold. 
To 
the 
9th 
. 


15. 
In 
like 
manner 
to 
hot 
vapor 
I 
subjoin 
as 
a 
negative 
the 
nature 
of 

vapor 
itself, 
such 
as 
we 
find 
it 
with 
us. 
For 
exhalations 
from 
oily 
substances, 
though 
easily 
inflammable, 
are 
yet 
not 
found 
to 
be 
warm 
unless 
newly 
exhaled 
from 
the 
warm 
body. 


To 
the 
10th 
. 


16. 
In 
like 
manner 
I 
subjoin 
as 
a 
negative 
to 
hot 
air 
the 
nature 
of 
air 
itself. 
For 
we 
do 
not 
find 
here 
any 
air 
that 
is 
warm, 
unless 
it 
has 
either 
been 
confined, 
or 
compressed, 
or 
manifestly 
warmed 
by 
the 
sun, 
fire, 
or 
some 
other 
warm 
substance. 
To 
the 
11th 
. 


17. 
I 
here 
subjoin 
the 
negative 
of 
colder 
weather 
than 
is 
suitable 
to 
the 
season 
of 
the 
year, 
which 
we 
find 
occurs 
during 
east 
and 
north 
winds; 
just 
as 
we 
have 
weather 
of 
the 
opposite 
kind 
with 
the 
south 
and 
west 
winds. 
So 
a 
tendency 
to 
rain, 
especially 
in 
wintertime, 
accompanies 
warm 
weather; 
while 
frost 
accompanies 
cold. 
To 
the 
12th 
.

Here 
I 
subjoin 
the 
negative 
of 
air 
confined 
in 
caverns 
during 
the 
summer. 
But 
the 
subject 
of 
air 
in 
confinement 
should 
by 
all 
means 
be 
more 
diligently 
examined. 
For 
in 
the 
first 
place 
it 
may 
well 
be 
a 
matter 
of 
doubt 
what 
is 
the 
nature 
of 
air 
in 
itself 
with 
regard 
to 
heat 
and 
cold. 
For 
air 
manifestly 
receives 
warmth 
from 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
heavenly 
bodies, 
and 
cold 
perhaps 
from 
the 
exhalations 
of 
the 
earth; 
and, 
again, 
in 
the 
middle 
region 
of 
air, 
as 
it 
is 
called, 
from 
cold 
vapors 
and 
snow. 
So 
that 
no 
opinion 
can 
be 
formed 
as 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
air 
from 
the 
examination 
of 
air 
that 
is 
at 
large 
and 
exposed, 
but 
a 
truer 
judgment 
might 
be 
made 
by 
examining 
it 
when 
confined. 
It 
is, 
however, 
necessary 
for 
the 
air 
to 
be 
confined 
in 
a 
vessel 
of 
such 
material 
as 
will 
not 
itself 
communicate 
warmth 
or 
cold 
to 
the 
air 
by 
its 
own 
nature, 
nor 
readily 
admit 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
outer 
atmosphere. 
Let 
the 
experiment 
therefore 
be 
made 
in 
an 
earthen 
jar 
wrapped 
round 
with 
many 
folds 
of 
leather 
to 
protect 
it 
from 
the 
outward 
air, 
and 
let 
the 
vessel 
remain 
tightly 
closed 
for 
three 
or 
four 
days; 
then 
open 
the 
vessel 
and 
test 
the 
degree 
of 
heat 
or 
cold 
by 
applying 
either 
the 
hand 
or 
a 
graduated 
glass. 
To 
the 
13th 
. 


19. 
In 
like 
manner 
a 
doubt 
suggests 
itself 
whether 
the 
warmth 
in 
wool, 
skins, 
feathers, 
and 
the 
like, 
proceeds 
from 
a 
faint 
degree 
of 
heat 

inherent 
in 
them, 
as 
being 
excretions 
from 
animals; 
or 
from 
a 
certain 
fat 
and 
oiliness, 
which 
is 
of 
a 
nature 
akin 
to 
warmth; 
or 
simply, 
as 
surmised 
in 
the 
preceding 
article, 
from 
the 
confinement 
and 
separation 
of 
the 
air. 
For 
all 
air 
that 
is 
cut 
off 
from 
connection 
with 
the 
outer 
air 
seems 
to 
have 
some 
warmth. 
Try 
the 
experiment 
therefore 
with 
fibrous 
substances 
made 
of 
linen; 
not 
of 
wool, 
feathers, 
or 
silk, 
which 
are 
excretions 
from 
animals. 
It 
should 
also 
be 
observed 
that 
all 
powders 
(in 
which 
there 
is 
manifestly 
air 
enclosed) 
are 
less 
cold 
than 
the 
whole 
substances 
they 
are 
made 
from; 
as 
likewise 
I 
suppose 
that 
all 
froth 
(as 
that 
which 
contains 
air) 
is 
less 
cold 
than 
the 
liquor 
it 
comes 
from. 


To 
the 
14th 
. 


20. 
To 
this 
no 
negative 
is 
subjoined. 
For 
there 
is 
nothing 
found 
among 
us, 
either 
tangible 
or 
spirituous, 
which 
does 
not 
contract 
warmth 
when 
put 
near 
fire. 
There 
is 
this 
difference 
however, 
that 
some 
substances 
contract 
warmth 
more 
quickly, 
as 
air, 
oil, 
and 
water; 
others 
more 
slowly, 
as 
stone 
and 
metal. 
But 
this 
belongs 
to 
the 
Table 
of 
Degrees. 
To 
the 
15th 
. 


21. 
To 
this 
instance 
I 
subjoin 
no 
negative, 
except 
that 
I 
would 
have 
it 
well 
observed 
that 
sparks 
are 
produced 
from 
flint 
and 
steel, 
or 
any 
other 
hard 
substance, 
only 
when 
certain 
minute 
particles 
are 
struck 
off 
from 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
stone 
or 
metal; 
and 
that 
the 
attrition 
of 
the 
air 
does 
not 
of 
itself 
ever 
produce 
sparks, 
as 
is 
commonly 
supposed. 
And 
the 
sparks 
themselves, 
too, 
owing 
to 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
ignited 
body, 
tend 
rather 
downwards 
than 
upwards; 
and 
on 
going 
out 
become 
a 
tangible 
sooty 
substance. 
To 
the 
16th 
. 


22. 
There 
is 
no 
negative, 
I 
think, 
to 
be 
subjoined 
to 
this 
instance. 
For 
we 
find 
among 
us 
no 
tangible 
body 
which 
does 
not 
manifestly 
gain 
warmth 
by 
attrition; 
insomuch 
that 
the 
ancients 
fancied 
that 
the 
heavenly 
bodies 
had 
no 
other 
means 
or 
power 
of 
producing 
warmth 
than 
by 
the 
attrition 
of 
the 
air 
in 
their 
rapid 
and 
hurried 
revolution. 
But 
on 
this 
subject 
we 
must 
further 
inquire 
whether 
bodies 
discharged 
from 
engines, 
as 
balls 
from 
cannon, 
do 
not 
acquire 
some 
degree 
of 
heat 
from 
the 
very 
percussion, 
so 
as 
to 
be 
found 
somewhat 
warm 
when 
they 
fall. 
Air 
in 
motion, 
however, 
rather 
chills 
than 
warms, 
as 
appears 
from 
wind, 
bellows, 
and 
blowing 
with 
the 
mouth 

contracted. 
But 
motion 
of 
this 
kind 
is 
not 
so 
rapid 
as 
to 
excite 
heat, 
and 
is 
the 
motion 
of 
a 
mass, 
and 
not 
of 
particles; 
so 
that 
it 
is 
no 
wonder 
if 
it 
does 
not 
generate 
heat. 


To 
the 
17th 
. 


23. 
On 
this 
instance 
should 
be 
made 
more 
diligent 
inquiry. 
For 
herbs 
and 
vegetables, 
when 
green 
and 
moist 
seem 
to 
contain 
some 
latent 
heat, 
though 
so 
slight 
that 
it 
is 
not 
perceptible 
to 
the 
touch 
when 
they 
are 
single, 
but 
only 
when 
they 
are 
collected 
and 
shut 
up 
together, 
so 
that 
their 
spirits 
may 
not 
breathe 
out 
into 
the 
air, 
but 
may 
mutually 
cherish 
each 
other; 
whereupon 
there 
arises 
a 
palpable 
heat, 
and 
sometimes 
flame 
in 
suitable 
matter. 
To 
the 
18th 
. 


24. 
On 
this 
instance 
too 
should 
be 
made 
more 
diligent 
inquiry. 
For 
quicklime 
sprinkled 
with 
water 
seems 
to 
contract 
heat 
either 
by 
the 
concentration 
of 
heat 
before 
dispersed, 
as 
in 
the 
above-mentioned 
case 
of 
confined 
herbs, 
or 
because 
the 
igneous 
spirit 
is 
irritated 
and 
exasperated 
by 
the 
water 
so 
as 
to 
cause 
a 
conflict 
and 
reaction. 
Which 
of 
these 
two 
is 
the 
real 
cause 
will 
more 
readily 
appear 
if 
oil 
be 
poured 
on 
instead 
of 
water, 
for 
oil 
will 
serve 
equally 
well 
with 
water 
to 
concentrate 
the 
enclosed 
spirit, 
but 
not 
to 
irritate 
it. 
We 
should 
also 
extend 
the 
experiment 
both 
by 
employing 
the 
ashes 
and 
rusts 
of 
different 
bodies, 
and 
by 
pouring 
in 
different 
liquids. 
To 
the 
19th 
. 


25. 
To 
this 
instance 
is 
subjoined 
the 
negative 
of 
other 
metals 
which 
are 
softer 
and 
more 
fusible. 
For 
gold 
leaf 
dissolved 
by 
aqua 
regia 
gives 
no 
heat 
to 
the 
touch; 
no 
more 
does 
lead 
dissolved 
in 
aqua 
fortis 
; 
neither 
again 
does 
quicksilver 
(as 
I 
remember); 
but 
silver 
itself 
does, 
and 
copper 
too 
(as 
I 
remember); 
tin 
still 
more 
manifestly; 
and 
most 
of 
all 
iron 
and 
steel, 
which 
not 
only 
excite 
a 
strong 
heat 
in 
dissolution 
but 
also 
a 
violent 
ebullition. 
It 
appears 
therefore 
that 
the 
heat 
is 
produced 
by 
conflict, 
the 
strong 
waters 
penetrating, 
digging 
into, 
and 
tearing 
asunder 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
substance, 
while 
the 
substance 
itself 
resists. 
But 
where 
the 
substances 
yield 
more 
easily, 
there 
is 
hardly 
any 
heat 
excited. 
To 
the 
20th 
. 


26. 
To 
the 
heat 
of 
animals 
no 
negative 
is 
subjoined, 
except 
that 
of 

insects 
(as 
above-mentioned) 
on 
account 
of 
their 
small 
size. 
For 
in 
fishes, 
as 
compared 
with 
land 
animals, 
it 
is 
rather 
a 
low 
degree 
than 
an 
absence 
of 
heat 
that 
is 
noted. 
But 
in 
vegetables 
and 
plants 
there 
is 
no 
degree 
of 
heat 
perceptible 
to 
the 
touch, 
either 
in 
their 
exudations 
or 
in 
their 
pith 
when 
freshly 
exposed. 
In 
animals, 
however, 
is 
found 
a 
great 
diversity 
of 
heat, 
both 
in 
their 
parts 
(there 
being 
different 
degrees 
of 
heat 
about 
the 
heart, 
in 
the 
brain, 
and 
on 
the 
skin) 
and 
in 
their 
accidents, 
as 
violent 
exercise 
and 
fevers. 


To 
the 
21st 
. 


27. 
To 
this 
instance 
it 
is 
hard 
to 
subjoin 
a 
negative. 
Indeed 
the 
excrements 
of 
animals 
when 
no 
longer 
fresh 
have 
manifestly 
a 
potential 
heat, 
as 
is 
seen 
in 
the 
enriching 
of 
soil. 
To 
the 
24th 
. 


28. 
Liquids, 
whether 
waters 
or 
oils, 
which 
possess 
a 
great 
and 
intense 
acridity, 
act 
like 
heat 
in 
tearing 
asunder 
bodies 
and 
burning 
them 
after 
some 
time; 
yet 
to 
the 
touch 
they 
are 
not 
hot 
at 
first. 
But 
their 
operation 
is 
relative 
and 
according 
to 
the 
porosity 
of 
the 
body 
to 
which 
they 
are 
applied. 
For 
aqua 
regia 
dissolves 
gold 
but 
not 
silver; 
aqua 
fortis 
, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
dissolves 
silver, 
but 
not 
gold; 
neither 
dissolves 
glass, 
and 
so 
on 
with 
others. 
To 
the 
22nd 
and 
23rd 
. 


29. 
Let 
trial 
be 
made 
of 
spirit 
of 
wine 
on 
wood, 
and 
also 
on 
butter, 
wax, 
or 
pitch; 
and 
observe 
whether 
by 
its 
heat 
it 
in 
any 
degree 
melts 
them. 
For 
the 
twenty-fourth 
instance 
exhibits 
a 
power 
in 
it 
that 
resembles 
heat 
in 
producing 
incrustation. 
In 
like 
manner 
therefore 
try 
its 
power 
in 
producing 
liquefaction. 
Let 
trial 
also 
be 
made 
with 
a 
graduated 
or 
calendar 
glass, 
hollow 
at 
the 
top; 
pour 
into 
the 
hollow 
spirit 
of 
wine 
well 
rectified, 
cover 
it 
up 
that 
the 
spirit 
may 
better 
retain 
its 
heat, 
and 
observe 
whether 
by 
its 
heat 
it 
makes 
the 
water 
sink. 
To 
the 
25th

Spices 
and 
acrid 
herbs 
strike 
hot 
on 
the 
palate, 
and 
much 
hotter 
on 
the 
stomach. 
Observe 
therefore 
on 
what 
other 
substances 
they 
produce 
the 
effects 
of 
heat. 
Sailors 
tell 
us 
that 
when 
large 
parcels 
and 
masses 
of 
spices 
are, 
after 
being 
long 
kept 
close, 
suddenly 
opened, 
those 
who 
first 
stir 
and 
take 
them 
out 
run 
the 
risk 
of 
fever 
and 
inflammation. 
It 
can 
also 
be 
tried 
whether 
such 
spices 
and 
herbs 
when 
pounded 
would 
not 
dry 
bacon 
and 
meat 
hung 

over 
them, 
as 
smoke 
does. 


To 
the 
26th 
. 


31. 
There 
is 
an 
acridity 
or 
pungency 
both 
in 
cold 
things, 
as 
vinegar 
and 
oil 
of 
vitriol, 
and 
in 
hot, 
as 
oil 
of 
marjoram 
and 
the 
like. 
Both 
alike 
therefore 
cause 
pain 
in 
animate 
substances, 
and 
tear 
asunder 
and 
consume 
the 
parts 
in 
such 
as 
are 
inanimate. 
To 
this 
instance 
again 
there 
is 
no 
negative 
subjoined. 
Moreover 
we 
find 
no 
pain 
in 
animals, 
save 
with 
a 
certain 
sensation 
of 
heat. 
To 
the 
27th 
. 


32. 
There 
are 
many 
actions 
common 
both 
to 
heat 
and 
cold, 
though 
in 
a 
very 
different 
manner. 
For 
boys 
find 
that 
snow 
after 
a 
while 
seems 
to 
burn 
their 
hands; 
and 
cold 
preserves 
meat 
from 
putrefaction, 
no 
less 
than 
fire; 
and 
heat 
contracts 
bodies, 
which 
cold 
does 
also. 
But 
these 
and 
similar 
instances 
may 
more 
conveniently 
be 
referred 
to 
the 
inquiry 
concerning 
cold. 
XIII 


Thirdly, 
we 
must 
make 
a 
presentation 
to 
the 
understanding 
of 
instances 
in 
which 
the 
nature 
under 
inquiry 
is 
found 
in 
different 
degrees, 
more 
or 
less; 
which 
must 
be 
done 
by 
making 
a 
comparison 
either 
of 
its 
increase 
and 
decrease 
in 
the 
same 
subject, 
or 
of 
its 
amount 
in 
different 
subjects, 
as 
compared 
one 
with 
another. 
For 
since 
the 
form 
of 
a 
thing 
is 
the 
very 
thing 
itself, 
and 
the 
thing 
differs 
from 
the 
form 
no 
otherwise 
than 
as 
the 
apparent 
differs 
from 
the 
real, 
or 
the 
external 
from 
the 
internal, 
or 
the 
thing 
in 
reference 
to 
man 
from 
the 
thing 
in 
reference 
to 
the 
universe, 
it 
necessarily 
follows 
that 
no 
nature 
can 
be 
taken 
as 
the 
true 
form, 
unless 
it 
always 
decrease 
when 
the 
nature 
in 
question 
decreases, 
and 
in 
like 
manner 
always 
increase 
when 
the 
nature 
in 
question 
increases. 
This 
Table 
therefore 
I 
call 
the 
Table 
of 
Degrees 
or 
the 
Table 
of 
Comparison 
. 


Table 
of 
Degrees 
or 
Comparison 
in 
Heat 


I 
will 
therefore 
first 
speak 
of 
those 
substances 
which 
contain 
no 
degree 
at 
all 
of 
heat 
perceptible 
to 
the 
touch, 
but 
seem 
to 
have 
a 
certain 
potential 
heat 
only, 
or 
disposition 
and 
preparation 
for 
hotness. 
After 
that 
I 
shall 
proceed 
to 
substances 
which 
are 
hot 
actually, 
and 
to 
the 
touch, 
and 
to 



their 
intensities 
and 
degrees. 


1. 
In 
solid 
and 
tangible 
bodies 
we 
find 
nothing 
which 
is 
in 
its 
nature 
originally 
hot. 
For 
no 
stone, 
metal, 
sulphur, 
fossil, 
wood, 
water, 
or 
carcass 
of 
animal 
is 
found 
to 
be 
hot. 
And 
the 
hot 
water 
in 
baths 
seems 
to 
be 
heated 
by 
external 
causes; 
whether 
it 
be 
by 
flame 
or 
subterraneous 
fire, 
such 
as 
is 
thrown 
up 
from 
Etna 
and 
many 
other 
mountains, 
or 
by 
the 
conflict 
of 
bodies, 
as 
heat 
is 
caused 
in 
the 
dissolution 
of 
iron 
and 
tin. 
There 
is 
therefore 
no 
degree 
of 
heat 
palpable 
to 
the 
touch 
in 
animate 
substances; 
but 
they 
differ 
in 
degree 
of 
cold, 
wood 
not 
being 
equally 
cold 
with 
metal. 
But 
this 
belongs 
to 
the 
Table 
of 
Degrees 
in 
Cold. 
2. 
As 
far, 
however, 
as 
potential 
heat 
and 
aptitude 
for 
flame 
is 
concerned, 
there 
are 
many 
inanimate 
substances 
found 
strongly 
disposed 
thereto, 
as 
sulphur, 
naphtha, 
rock 
oil. 
3. 
Substances 
once 
hot, 
as 
horse 
dung 
from 
animal 
heat, 
and 
lime 
or 
perhaps 
ashes 
and 
soot 
from 
fire, 
retain 
some 
latent 
remains 
of 
their 
former 
heat. 
Hence 
certain 
distillations 
and 
resolutions 
of 
bodies 
are 
made 
by 
burying 
them 
in 
horse 
dung, 
and 
heat 
is 
excited 
in 
lime 
by 
sprinkling 
it 
with 
water, 
as 
already 
mentioned. 
4. 
In 
the 
vegetable 
creation 
we 
find 
no 
plant 
or 
part 
of 
plant 
(as 
gum 
or 
pitch) 
which 
is 
warm 
to 
the 
human 
touch. 
But 
yet, 
as 
stated 
above, 
green 
herbs 
gain 
warmth 
by 
being 
shut 
up; 
and 
to 
the 
internal 
touch, 
as 
the 
palate 
or 
stomach, 
and 
even 
to 
external 
parts, 
after 
a 
little 
time, 
as 
in 
plasters 
and 
ointments, 
some 
vegetables 
are 
perceptibly 
warm 
and 
others 
cold. 
5. 
In 
the 
parts 
of 
animals 
after 
death 
or 
separation 
from 
the 
body, 
we 
find 
nothing 
warm 
to 
the 
human 
touch. 
Not 
even 
horse 
dung, 
unless 
enclosed 
and 
buried, 
retains 
its 
heat. 
But 
yet 
all 
dung 
seems 
to 
have 
a 
potential 
heat, 
as 
is 
seen 
in 
the 
fattening 
of 
the 
land. 
In 
like 
manner 
carcasses 
of 
animals 
have 
some 
such 
latent 
and 
potential 
heat, 
insomuch 
that 
in 
burying 
grounds, 
where 
burials 
take 
place 
daily, 
the 
earth 
collects 
a 
certain 
hidden 
heat 
which 
consumes 
a 
body 
newly 
laid 
in 
it 
much 
more 
speedily 
than 
pure 
earth. 
We 
are 
told 
too 
that 
in 
the 
East 
there 
is 
discovered 
a 
fine 
soft 
texture, 
made 
of 
the 
down 
of 
birds, 
which 
by 
an 
innate 
force 
dissolves 
and 
melts 
butter 
when 
lightly 
wrapped 
in 
it. 
6. 
Substances 
which 
fatten 
the 
soil, 
as 
dung 
of 
all 
kinds, 
chalk, 
sea 

sand, 
salt, 
and 
the 
like, 
have 
some 
disposition 
to 
heat. 


7. 
All 
putrefaction 
contains 
in 
itself 
certain 
elements 
of 
a 
slight 
heat, 
though 
not 
so 
much 
as 
to 
be 
perceived 
by 
the 
touch. 
For 
not 
even 
those 
substances 
which 
on 
putrefaction 
turn 
to 
animalculae, 
as 
flesh, 
cheese, 
etc., 
feel 
warm 
to 
the 
touch; 
no 
more 
does 
rotten 
wood, 
which 
shines 
in 
the 
dark. 
Heat, 
however, 
in 
putrid 
substances 
sometimes 
betrays 
itself 
by 
foul 
and 
powerful 
odors. 
8. 
The 
first 
degree 
of 
heat 
therefore 
among 
those 
substances 
which 
feel 
hot 
to 
the 
touch, 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
heat 
of 
animals, 
which 
has 
a 
pretty 
great 
extent 
in 
its 
degrees. 
For 
the 
lowest, 
as 
in 
insects, 
is 
hardly 
perceptible 
to 
the 
touch, 
but 
the 
highest 
scarcely 
equals 
the 
sun's 
heat 
in 
the 
hottest 
countries 
and 
seasons, 
nor 
is 
it 
too 
great 
to 
be 
borne 
by 
the 
hand. 
It 
is 
said, 
however, 
of 
Constantius, 
and 
some 
others 
of 
a 
very 
dry 
constitution 
and 
habit 
of 
body, 
that 
in 
violent 
fevers 
they 
became 
so 
hot 
as 
somewhat 
to 
burn 
the 
hand 
that 
touched 
them. 
9. 
Animals 
increase 
in 
heat 
by 
motion 
and 
exercise, 
wine, 
feasting, 
venus, 
burning 
fevers, 
and 
pain. 
10. 
When 
attacked 
by 
intermittent 
fevers, 
animals 
are 
at 
first 
seized 
with 
cold 
and 
shivering, 
but 
soon 
after 
they 
become 
exceedingly 
hot, 
which 
is 
their 
condition 
from 
the 
first 
in 
burning 
and 
pestilential 
fevers. 
11. 
Let 
further 
inquiry 
be 
made 
into 
the 
different 
degrees 
of 
heat 
in 
different 
animals, 
as 
in 
fishes, 
quadrupeds, 
serpents, 
birds; 
and 
also 
according 
to 
their 
species, 
as 
in 
the 
lion, 
the 
kite, 
the 
man; 
for 
in 
common 
opinion 
fish 
are 
the 
least 
hot 
internally, 
and 
birds 
the 
hottest, 
especially 
doves, 
hawks, 
and 
sparrows. 
12. 
Let 
further 
inquiry 
be 
made 
into 
the 
different 
degrees 
of 
heat 
in 
the 
different 
parts 
and 
limbs 
of 
the 
same 
animal. 
For 
milk, 
blood, 
seed, 
eggs, 
are 
found 
to 
be 
hot 
only 
in 
a 
moderate 
degree, 
and 
less 
hot 
than 
the 
outer 
flesh 
of 
the 
animal 
when 
in 
motion 
or 
agitated. 
But 
what 
the 
degree 
of 
heat 
is 
in 
the 
brain, 
stomach, 
heart, 
etc., 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
in 
like 
manner 
inquired. 
13. 
All 
animals 
in 
winter 
and 
cold 
weather 
are 
cold 
externally, 
but 
internally 
they 
are 
thought 
to 
be 
even 
hotter. 
14. 
The 
heat 
of 
the 
heavenly 
bodies, 
even 
in 
the 
hottest 
countries, 
and 
at 
the 
hottest 
times 
of 
the 
year 
and 
day, 
is 
never 
sufficiently 
strong 
to 
set 

on 
fire 
or 
burn 
the 
driest 
wood 
or 
straw, 
or 
even 
tinder, 
unless 
strengthened 
by 
burning 
glasses 
or 
mirrors. 
It 
is, 
however, 
able 
to 
extract 
vapor 
from 
moist 
substances. 


15. 
By 
the 
tradition 
of 
astronomers 
some 
stars 
are 
hotter 
than 
others. 
Of 
planets, 
Mars 
is 
accounted 
the 
hottest 
after 
the 
sun; 
then 
comes 
Jupiter, 
and 
then 
Venus. 
Others, 
again, 
are 
set 
down 
as 
cold: 
the 
moon, 
for 
instance, 
and 
above 
all 
Saturn. 
Of 
fixed 
stars, 
Sirius 
is 
said 
to 
be 
the 
hottest, 
then 
Cor 
Leonis 
or 
Regulus, 
then 
Canicula, 
and 
so 
on. 
16. 
The 
sun 
gives 
greater 
heat 
the 
nearer 
he 
approaches 
to 
the 
perpendicular 
or 
zenith; 
and 
this 
is 
probably 
true 
of 
the 
other 
planets 
also, 
according 
to 
the 
proportion 
of 
their 
heat. 
Jupiter, 
for 
instance, 
is 
hotter, 
probably, 
to 
us 
when 
under 
Cancer 
or 
Leo 
than 
under 
Capricorn 
or 
Aquarius. 
17. 
We 
must 
also 
believe 
that 
the 
sun 
and 
other 
planets 
give 
more 
heat 
in 
perigee, 
from 
their 
proximity 
to 
the 
earth, 
than 
they 
do 
in 
apogee. 
But 
if 
it 
happens 
that 
in 
some 
region 
the 
sun 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
in 
perigee 
and 
near 
the 
perpendicular, 
his 
heat 
must 
of 
necessity 
be 
greater 
than 
in 
a 
region 
where 
he 
is 
also 
in 
perigee, 
but 
shining 
more 
obliquely. 
And 
therefore 
the 
altitude 
of 
the 
planets 
in 
their 
exaltation 
in 
different 
regions 
ought 
to 
be 
noted, 
with 
respect 
to 
perpendicularity 
or 
obliquity. 
18. 
The 
sun 
and 
other 
planets 
are 
supposed 
to 
give 
greater 
heat 
when 
nearer 
to 
the 
larger 
fixed 
stars. 
Thus 
when 
the 
sun 
is 
in 
Leo 
he 
is 
nearer 
Cor 
Leonis, 
Cauda 
Leonis, 
Spica 
Virginis, 
Sirius 
and 
Canicula, 
than 
when 
he 
is 
in 
Cancer, 
in 
which 
sign, 
however, 
he 
is 
nearer 
to 
the 
perpendicular. 
And 
it 
must 
be 
supposed 
that 
those 
parts 
of 
the 
heavens 
shed 
the 
greatest 
heat 
(though 
it 
be 
not 
at 
all 
perceptible 
to 
the 
touch) 
which 
are 
the 
most 
adorned 
with 
stars, 
especially 
of 
a 
larger 
size. 
19. 
Altogether, 
the 
heat 
of 
the 
heavenly 
bodies 
is 
increased 
in 
three 
ways: 
first, 
by 
perpendicularity; 
secondly, 
by 
proximity 
or 
perigee; 
thirdly, 
by 
the 
conjunction 
or 
combination 
of 
stars. 
20. 
The 
heat 
of 
animals, 
and 
of 
the 
rays 
of 
the 
heavenly 
bodies 
also 
(as 
they 
reach 
us), 
is 
found 
to 
differ 
by 
a 
wide 
interval 
from 
flame, 
though 
of 
the 
mildest 
kind, 
and 
from 
all 
ignited 
bodies; 
and 
from 
liquids 
also, 
and 
air 
itself 
when 
highly 
heated 
by 
fire. 
For 
the 
flame 
of 
spirit 
of 
wine, 
though 
scattered 
and 
not 
condensed, 
is 
yet 
sufficient 
to 
set 
paper, 
straw, 
or 
linen 
on 

fire, 
which 
the 
heat 
of 
animals 
will 
never 
do, 
or 
of 
the 
sun 
without 
a 
burning 
glass 
or 
mirror. 


21. 
There 
are, 
however, 
many 
degrees 
of 
strength 
and 
weakness 
in 
the 
heat 
of 
flame 
and 
ignited 
bodies. 
But 
as 
they 
have 
never 
been 
diligently 
inquired 
into, 
we 
must 
pass 
them 
lightly 
over. 
It 
appears, 
however, 
that 
of 
all 
flame 
that 
of 
spirit 
of 
wine 
is 
the 
softest, 
unless 
perhaps 
ignis 
fatuus 
be 
softer, 
and 
the 
flames 
or 
sparklings 
arising 
from 
the 
sweat 
of 
animals. 
Next 
to 
this, 
as 
I 
suppose, 
comes 
flame 
from 
light 
and 
porous 
vegetable 
matter, 
as 
straw, 
reeds, 
and 
dried 
leaves, 
from 
which 
the 
flame 
from 
hairs 
or 
feathers 
does 
not 
much 
differ. 
Next 
perhaps 
comes 
flame 
from 
wood, 
especially 
such 
as 
contains 
but 
little 
rosin 
or 
pitch; 
with 
this 
distinction, 
however, 
that 
the 
flame 
from 
small 
pieces 
of 
wood 
(such 
as 
are 
commonly 
tied 
up 
in 
fagots) 
is 
milder 
than 
the 
flame 
from 
trunks 
and 
roots 
of 
trees. 
And 
this 
you 
may 
try 
any 
day 
in 
furnaces 
for 
smelting 
iron, 
in 
which 
a 
fire 
made 
with 
fagots 
and 
boughs 
of 
trees 
is 
of 
no 
great 
use. 
After 
this 
I 
think 
comes 
flame 
from 
oil, 
tallow, 
wax, 
and 
such 
like 
fat 
and 
oily 
substances, 
which 
have 
no 
great 
acrimony. 
But 
the 
most 
violent 
heat 
is 
found 
in 
pitch 
and 
rosin; 
and 
yet 
more 
in 
sulphur, 
camphor, 
naphtha, 
rock 
oil, 
and 
salts 
(after 
the 
crude 
matter 
is 
discharged), 
and 
in 
their 
compounds, 
as 
gunpowder, 
Greek 
fire 
(commonly 
called 
wildfire), 
and 
its 
different 
kinds, 
which 
have 
so 
stubborn 
a 
heat 
that 
they 
are 
not 
easily 
extinguished 
by 
water. 
22. 
I 
think 
also 
that 
the 
flame 
which 
results 
from 
some 
imperfect 
metals 
is 
very 
strong 
and 
eager. 
But 
on 
these 
points 
let 
further 
inquiry 
be 
made. 
23. 
The 
flame 
of 
powerful 
lightning 
seems 
to 
exceed 
in 
strength 
all 
the 
former, 
for 
it 
has 
even 
been 
known 
to 
melt 
wrought 
iron 
into 
drops, 
which 
those 
other 
flames 
cannot 
do. 
24. 
In 
ignited 
bodies 
too 
there 
are 
different 
degrees 
of 
heat, 
though 
these 
again 
have 
not 
yet 
been 
diligently 
examined. 
The 
weakest 
heat 
of 
all, 
I 
think, 
is 
that 
from 
tinder, 
such 
as 
we 
use 
to 
kindle 
flame 
with; 
and 
in 
like 
manner 
that 
of 
touchwood 
or 
tow, 
which 
is 
used 
in 
firing 
cannon. 
After 
this 
comes 
ignited 
wood 
or 
coal, 
and 
also 
bricks 
and 
the 
like 
heated 
to 
ignition. 
But 
of 
all 
ignited 
substances, 
the 
hottest, 
as 
I 
take 
it, 
are 
ignited 
metals, 
as 
iron, 
copper, 
etc. 
But 
these 
require 
further 
investigation. 
25. 
Some 
ignited 
bodies 
are 
found 
to 
be 
much 
hotter 
than 
some 

flames. 
Ignited 
iron, 
for 
instance, 
is 
much 
hotter 
and 
more 
consuming 
than 
flame 
of 
spirit 
of 
wine. 


26. 
Of 
substances 
also 
which 
are 
not 
ignited 
but 
only 
heated 
by 
fire, 
as 
boiling 
water 
and 
air 
confined 
in 
furnaces, 
some 
are 
found 
to 
exceed 
in 
heat 
many 
flames 
and 
ignited 
substances. 
27. 
Motion 
increases 
heat, 
as 
you 
may 
see 
in 
bellows 
and 
by 
blowing; 
insomuch 
that 
the 
harder 
metals 
are 
not 
dissolved 
or 
melted 
by 
a 
dead 
or 
quiet 
fire, 
till 
it 
be 
made 
intense 
by 
blowing. 
28. 
Let 
trial 
be 
made 
with 
burning 
glasses, 
which 
(as 
I 
remember) 
act 
thus. 
If 
you 
place 
a 
burning 
glass 
at 
the 
distance 
of 
(say) 
a 
span 
from 
a 
combustible 
body, 
it 
will 
not 
burn 
or 
consume 
it 
so 
easily 
as 
if 
it 
were 
first 
placed 
at 
the 
distance 
of 
(say) 
half 
a 
span, 
and 
then 
moved 
gradually 
and 
slowly 
to 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
whole 
span. 
And 
yet 
the 
cone 
and 
union 
of 
rays 
are 
the 
same; 
but 
the 
motion 
itself 
increases 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
heat. 
29. 
Fires 
which 
break 
out 
during 
a 
strong 
wind 
are 
thought 
to 
make 
greater 
progress 
against 
than 
with 
it; 
because 
the 
flame 
recoils 
more 
violently 
when 
the 
wind 
gives 
way 
than 
it 
advances 
while 
the 
wind 
is 
driving 
it 
on. 
30. 
Flame 
does 
not 
burst 
out, 
nor 
is 
it 
generated, 
unless 
some 
hollow 
space 
be 
allowed 
it 
to 
move 
and 
play 
in; 
except 
the 
explosive 
flame 
of 
gunpowder 
and 
the 
like, 
where 
compression 
and 
imprisonment 
increase 
its 
fury. 
31. 
An 
anvil 
grows 
very 
hot 
under 
the 
hammer, 
insomuch 
that 
if 
it 
were 
made 
of 
a 
thin 
plate 
it 
might, 
I 
suppose, 
with 
strong 
and 
continuous 
blows 
of 
the 
hammer, 
grow 
red 
like 
ignited 
iron. 
But 
let 
this 
be 
tried 
by 
experiment. 
32. 
But 
in 
ignited 
substances 
which 
are 
porous, 
so 
as 
to 
give 
the 
fire 
room 
to 
move, 
if 
this 
motion 
be 
checked 
by 
strong 
compression, 
the 
fire 
is 
immediately 
extinguished. 
For 
instance, 
when 
tinder, 
or 
the 
burning 
wick 
of 
a 
candle 
or 
lamp, 
or 
even 
live 
charcoal 
or 
coal, 
is 
pressed 
down 
with 
an 
extinguisher, 
or 
with 
the 
foot, 
or 
any 
similar 
instrument, 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
fire 
instantly 
ceases. 
33. 
Approximation 
to 
a 
hot 
body 
increases 
heat 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
degree 
of 
approximation. 
And 
this 
is 
the 
case 
also 
with 
light; 
for 
the 
nearer 
an 
object 
is 
brought 
to 
the 
light, 
the 
more 
visible 
it 
becomes. 

34. 
The 
union 
of 
different 
heats 
increases 
heat, 
unless 
the 
hot 
substances 
be 
mixed 
together. 
For 
a 
large 
fire 
and 
a 
small 
fire 
in 
the 
same 
room 
increase 
one 
another's 
heat; 
but 
warm 
water 
plunged 
into 
boiling 
water 
cools 
it. 
35. 
The 
continued 
application 
of 
a 
hot 
body 
increases 
heat, 
because 
heat 
perpetually 
passing 
and 
emanating 
from 
it 
mingles 
with 
the 
previously 
existing 
heat, 
and 
so 
multiplies 
the 
heat. 
For 
a 
fire 
does 
not 
warm 
a 
room 
as 
well 
in 
half 
an 
hour 
as 
it 
does 
if 
continued 
through 
the 
whole 
hour. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
the 
case 
with 
light; 
for 
a 
lamp 
or 
candle 
gives 
no 
more 
light 
after 
it 
has 
been 
long 
lighted 
than 
it 
did 
at 
first. 
36. 
Irritation 
by 
surrounding 
cold 
increases 
heat, 
as 
you 
may 
see 
in 
fires 
during 
a 
sharp 
frost. 
And 
this 
I 
think 
is 
owing 
not 
merely 
to 
the 
confinement 
and 
contraction 
of 
the 
heat, 
which 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
union, 
but 
also 
to 
irritation. 
Thus, 
when 
air 
or 
a 
stick 
is 
violently 
compressed 
or 
bent, 
it 
recoils 
not 
merely 
to 
the 
point 
it 
was 
forced 
from, 
but 
beyond 
it 
on 
the 
other 
side. 
Let 
trial 
therefore 
be 
carefully 
made 
by 
putting 
a 
stick 
or 
some 
such 
thing 
into 
flame, 
and 
observing 
whether 
it 
is 
not 
burnt 
more 
quickly 
at 
the 
sides 
than 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
flame. 
37. 
There 
are 
many 
degrees 
in 
susceptibility 
of 
heat. 
And 
first 
of 
all 
it 
is 
to 
be 
observed 
how 
slight 
and 
faint 
a 
heat 
changes 
and 
somewhat 
warms 
even 
those 
bodies 
which 
are 
least 
of 
all 
susceptible 
of 
heat. 
Even 
the 
heat 
of 
the 
hand 
communicates 
some 
heat 
to 
a 
ball 
of 
lead 
or 
any 
metal, 
if 
held 
in 
it 
a 
little 
while. 
So 
readily 
and 
so 
universally 
is 
heat 
transmitted 
and 
excited, 
the 
body 
remaining 
to 
all 
appearance 
unchanged. 
38. 
Of 
all 
substances 
that 
we 
are 
acquainted 
with, 
the 
one 
which 
most 
readily 
receives 
and 
loses 
heat 
is 
air; 
as 
is 
best 
seen 
in 
calendar 
glasses 
[air 
thermoscopes], 
which 
are 
made 
thus. 
Take 
a 
glass 
with 
a 
hollow 
belly, 
a 
thin 
and 
oblong 
neck; 
turn 
it 
upside 
down 
and 
lower 
it, 
with 
the 
mouth 
downwards 
and 
the 
belly 
upwards, 
into 
another 
glass 
vessel 
containing 
water; 
and 
let 
the 
mouth 
of 
the 
inserted 
vessel 
touch 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
receiving 
vessel 
and 
its 
neck 
lean 
slightly 
against 
the 
mouth 
of 
the 
other, 
so 
that 
it 
can 
stand. 
And 
that 
this 
may 
be 
done 
more 
conveniently, 
apply 
a 
little 
wax 
to 
the 
mouth 
of 
the 
receiving 
glass, 
but 
not 
so 
as 
to 
seal 
its 
mouth 
quite 
up, 
in 
order 
that 
the 
motion, 
of 
which 
we 
are 
going 
to 
speak, 
and 
which 
is 
very 
facile 
and 
delicate, 
may 
not 
be 
impeded 
by 
want 
of 
a 
supply 
of 
air. 

The 
lowered 
glass, 
before 
being 
inserted 
into 
the 
other, 
must 
be 
heated 
before 
a 
fire 
in 
its 
upper 
part, 
that 
is 
its 
belly. 
Now 
when 
it 
is 
placed 
in 
the 
position 
I 
have 
described, 
the 
air 
which 
was 
dilated 
by 
the 
heat 
will, 
after 
a 
lapse 
of 
time 
sufficient 
to 
allow 
for 
the 
extinction 
of 
that 
adventitious 
heat, 
withdraw 
and 
contract 
itself 
to 
the 
same 
extension 
or 
dimension 
as 
that 
of 
the 
surrounding 
air 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
immersion 
of 
the 
glass, 
and 
will 
draw 
the 
water 
upwards 
to 
a 
corresponding 
height. 
To 
the 
side 
of 
the 
glass 
there 
should 
be 
affixed 
a 
strip 
of 
paper, 
narrow 
and 
oblong, 
and 
marked 
with 
as 
many 
degrees 
as 
you 
choose. 
You 
will 
then 
see, 
according 
as 
the 
day 
is 
warm 
or 
cold, 
that 
the 
air 
contracts 
under 
the 
action 
of 
cold, 
and 
expands 
under 
the 
action 
of 
heat; 
as 
will 
be 
seen 
by 
the 
water 
rising 
when 
the 
air 
contracts, 
and 
sinking 
when 
it 
dilates. 
But 
the 
air's 
sense 
of 
heat 
and 
cold 
is 
so 
subtle 
and 
exquisite 
as 
far 
to 
exceed 
the 
perception 
of 
the 
human 
touch, 
insomuch 
that 
a 
ray 
of 
sunshine, 
or 
the 
heat 
of 
the 
breath, 
much 
more 
the 
heat 
of 
one's 
hand 
placed 
on 
the 
top 
of 
the 
glass, 
will 
cause 
the 
water 
immediately 
to 
sink 
in 
a 
perceptible 
degree. 
And 
yet 
I 
think 
that 
animal 
spirits 
have 
a 
sense 
of 
heat 
and 
cold 
more 
exquisite 
still, 
were 
it 
not 
that 
it 
is 
impeded 
and 
deadened 
by 
the 
grossness 
of 
the 
body. 


39. 
Next 
to 
air, 
I 
take 
those 
bodies 
to 
be 
most 
sensitive 
to 
heat 
which 
have 
been 
recently 
changed 
and 
compressed 
by 
cold, 
as 
snow 
and 
ice; 
for 
they 
begin 
to 
dissolve 
and 
melt 
with 
any 
gentle 
heat. 
Next 
to 
them, 
perhaps, 
comes 
quicksilver. 
After 
that 
follow 
greasy 
substances, 
as 
oil, 
butter, 
and 
the 
like; 
then 
comes 
wood; 
then 
water; 
and 
lastly 
stones 
and 
metals, 
which 
are 
slow 
to 
heat, 
especially 
in 
the 
inside. 
These, 
however, 
when 
once 
they 
have 
acquired 
heat 
retain 
it 
very 
long; 
in 
so 
much 
that 
an 
ignited 
brick, 
stone, 
or 
piece 
of 
iron, 
when 
plunged 
into 
a 
basin 
of 
water, 
will 
remain 
for 
a 
quarter 
of 
an 
hour, 
or 
thereabouts, 
so 
hot 
that 
you 
cannot 
touch 
it. 
40. 
The 
less 
the 
mass 
of 
a 
body, 
the 
sooner 
is 
it 
heated 
by 
the 
approach 
of 
a 
hot 
body; 
which 
shows 
that 
all 
heat 
of 
which 
we 
have 
experience 
is 
in 
some 
sort 
opposed 
to 
tangible 
matter. 
41. 
Heat, 
as 
far 
as 
regards 
the 
sense 
and 
touch 
of 
man, 
is 
a 
thing 
various 
and 
relative; 
insomuch 
that 
tepid 
water 
feels 
hot 
if 
the 
hand 
be 
cold, 
but 
cold 
if 
the 
hand 
be 
hot. 
XIV 



How 
poor 
we 
are 
in 
history 
anyone 
may 
see 
from 
the 
foregoing 
tables, 
where 
I 
not 
only 
insert 
sometimes 
mere 
traditions 
and 
reports 
(though 
never 
without 
a 
note 
of 
doubtful 
credit 
and 
authority) 
in 
place 
of 
history 
proved 
and 
instances 
certain, 
but 
am 
also 
frequently 
forced 
to 
use 
the 
words 
"Let 
trial 
be 
made," 
or 
"Let 
it 
be 
further 
inquired." 


XV 


The 
work 
and 
office 
of 
these 
three 
tables 
I 
call 
the 
Presentation 
of 
Instances 
to 
the 
Understanding. 
Which 
presentation 
having 
been 
made, 
induction 
itself 
must 
be 
set 
at 
work; 
for 
the 
problem 
is, 
upon 
a 
review 
of 
the 
instances, 
all 
and 
each, 
to 
find 
such 
a 
nature 
as 
is 
always 
present 
or 
absent 
with 
the 
given 
nature, 
and 
always 
increases 
and 
decreases 
with 
it; 
and 
which 
is, 
as 
I 
have 
said, 
a 
particular 
case 
of 
a 
more 
general 
nature. 
Now 
if 
the 
mind 
attempt 
this 
affirmatively 
from 
the 
first, 
as 
when 
left 
to 
itself 
it 
is 
always 
wont 
to 
do, 
the 
result 
will 
be 
fancies 
and 
guesses 
and 
notions 
ill 
defined, 
and 
axioms 
that 
must 
be 
mended 
every 
day, 
unless 
like 
the 
schoolmen 
we 
have 
a 
mind 
to 
fight 
for 
what 
is 
false; 
though 
doubtless 
these 
will 
be 
better 
or 
worse 
according 
to 
the 
faculties 
and 
strength 
of 
the 
understanding 
which 
is 
at 
work. 
To 
God, 
truly, 
the 
Giver 
and 
Architect 
of 
Forms, 
and 
it 
may 
be 
to 
the 
angels 
and 
higher 
intelligences, 
it 
belongs 
to 
have 
an 
affirmative 
knowledge 
of 
forms 
immediately, 
and 
from 
the 
first 
contemplation. 
But 
this 
assuredly 
is 
more 
than 
man 
can 
do, 
to 
whom 
it 
is 
granted 
only 
to 
proceed 
at 
first 
by 
negatives, 
and 
at 
last 
to 
end 
in 
affirmatives 
after 
exclusion 
has 
been 
exhausted. 


XVI 


We 
must 
make, 
therefore, 
a 
complete 
solution 
and 
separation 
of 
nature, 
not 
indeed 
by 
fire, 
but 
by 
the 
mind, 
which 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
divine 
fire. 
The 
first 
work, 
therefore, 
of 
true 
induction 
(as 
far 
as 
regards 
the 
discovery 
of 
forms) 
is 
the 
rejection 
or 
exclusion 
of 
the 
several 
natures 
which 
are 
not 
found 
in 
some 
instance 
where 
the 
given 
nature 
is 
present, 
or 
are 
found 
in 
some 
instance 
where 
the 
given 
nature 
is 
absent, 
or 
are 
found 
to 
increase 
in 
some 
instance 
when 
the 
given 
nature 
decreases, 
or 
to 
decrease 
when 
the 
given 



nature 
increases. 
Then 
indeed 
after 
the 
rejection 
and 
exclusion 
has 
been 
duly 
made, 
there 
will 
remain 
at 
the 
bottom, 
all 
light 
opinions 
vanishing 
into 
smoke, 
a 
form 
affirmative, 
solid, 
and 
true 
and 
well 
defined. 
This 
is 
quickly 
said; 
but 
the 
way 
to 
come 
at 
it 
is 
winding 
and 
intricate. 
I 
will 
endeavor, 
however, 
not 
to 
overlook 
any 
of 
the 
points 
which 
may 
help 
us 
toward 
it. 


XVII 


But 
when 
I 
assign 
so 
prominent 
a 
part 
to 
forms, 
I 
cannot 
too 
often 
warn 
and 
admonish 
men 
against 
applying 
what 
I 
say 
to 
those 
forms 
to 
which 
their 
thoughts 
and 
contemplations 
have 
hitherto 
been 
accustomed. 


For 
in 
the 
first 
place 
I 
do 
not 
at 
present 
speak 
of 
compound 
forms, 
which 
are, 
as 
I 
have 
remarked, 
combinations 
of 
simple 
natures 
according 
to 
the 
common 
course 
of 
the 
universe: 
as 
of 
the 
lion, 
eagle, 
rose, 
gold, 
and 
the 
like. 
It 
will 
be 
time 
to 
treat 
of 
these 
when 
we 
come 
to 
the 
latent 
processes 
and 
latent 
configurations, 
and 
the 
discovery 
of 
them, 
as 
they 
are 
found 
in 
what 
are 
called 
substances 
or 
natures 
concrete. 


And 
even 
in 
the 
case 
of 
simple 
natures 
I 
would 
not 
be 
understood 
to 
speak 
of 
abstract 
forms 
and 
ideas, 
either 
not 
defined 
in 
matter 
at 
all, 
or 
ill 
defined. 
For 
when 
I 
speak 
of 
forms, 
I 
mean 
nothing 
more 
than 
those 
laws 
and 
determinations 
of 
absolute 
actuality 
which 
govern 
and 
constitute 
any 
simple 
nature, 
as 
heat, 
light, 
weight, 
in 
every 
kind 
of 
matter 
and 
subject 
that 
is 
susceptible 
of 
them. 
Thus 
the 
form 
of 
heat 
or 
the 
form 
of 
light 
is 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
the 
law 
of 
heat 
or 
the 
law 
of 
light. 
Nor 
indeed 
do 
I 
ever 
allow 
myself 
to 
be 
drawn 
away 
from 
things 
themselves 
and 
the 
operative 
part. 
And 
therefore 
when 
I 
say 
(for 
instance) 
in 
the 
investigation 
of 
the 
form 
of 
heat, 
"reject 
rarity," 
or 
"rarity 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
form 
of 
heat," 
it 
is 
the 
same 
as 
if 
I 
said, 
"It 
is 
possible 
to 
superinduce 
heat 
on 
a 
dense 
body"; 
or, 
"It 
is 
possible 
to 
take 
away 
or 
keep 
out 
heat 
from 
a 
rare 
body." 


But 
if 
anyone 
conceive 
that 
my 
forms 
too 
are 
of 
a 
somewhat 
abstract 
nature, 
because 
they 
mix 
and 
combine 
things 
heterogeneous 
(for 
the 
heat 
of 
heavenly 
bodies 
and 
the 
heat 
of 
fire 
seem 
to 
be 
very 
heterogeneous; 
so 
do 
the 
fixed 
red 
of 
the 
rose 
or 
the 
like, 
and 
the 
apparent 
red 
in 
the 
rainbow, 
the 
opal, 
or 
the 
diamond; 
so 
again 
do 
the 
different 
kinds 
of 
death: 
death 
by 
drowning, 
by 
hanging, 
by 
stabbing, 
by 
apoplexy, 
by 
atrophy; 
and 
yet 
they 
agree 



severally 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
heat, 
redness, 
death); 
if 
anyone, 
I 
say, 
be 
of 
this 
opinion, 
he 
may 
be 
assured 
that 
his 
mind 
is 
held 
in 
captivity 
by 
custom, 
by 
the 
gross 
appearance 
of 
things, 
and 
by 
men's 
opinions. 
For 
it 
is 
most 
certain 
that 
these 
things, 
however 
heterogeneous 
and 
alien 
from 
each 
other, 
agree 
in 
the 
form 
or 
law 
which 
governs 
heat, 
redness 
and 
death; 
and 
that 
the 
power 
of 
man 
cannot 
possibly 
be 
emancipated 
and 
freed 
from 
the 
common 
course 
of 
nature, 
and 
expanded 
and 
exalted 
to 
new 
efficients 
and 
new 
modes 
of 
operation, 
except 
by 
the 
revelation 
and 
discovery 
of 
forms 
of 
this 
kind. 
And 
yet, 
when 
I 
have 
spoken 
of 
this 
union 
of 
nature, 
which 
is 
the 
point 
of 
most 
importance, 
I 
shall 
proceed 
to 
the 
divisions 
and 
veins 
of 
nature, 
as 
well 
the 
ordinary 
as 
those 
that 
are 
more 
inward 
and 
exact, 
and 
speak 
of 
them 
in 
their 
place. 


XVIII 


I 
must 
now 
give 
an 
example 
of 
the 
exclusion 
or 
rejection 
of 
natures 
which 
by 
the 
Tables 
of 
Presentation 
are 
found 
not 
to 
belong 
to 
the 
form 
of 
heat; 
observing 
in 
the 
meantime 
that 
not 
only 
each 
table 
suffices 
for 
the 
rejection 
of 
any 
nature, 
but 
even 
any 
one 
of 
the 
particular 
instances 
contained 
in 
any 
of 
the 
tables. 
For 
it 
is 
manifest 
from 
what 
has 
been 
said 
that 
any 
one 
contradictory 
instance 
overthrows 
a 
conjecture 
as 
to 
the 
form. 
But 
nevertheless 
for 
clearness' 
sake 
and 
that 
the 
use 
of 
the 
tables 
may 
be 
more 
plainly 
shown, 
I 
sometimes 
double 
or 
multiply 
an 
exclusion. 


An 
Example 
of 
Exclusion, 
or 
Rejection 
of 
Natures 
from 
the 
Form 
of 
Heat 


1. 
On 
account 
of 
the 
rays 
of 
the 
sun, 
reject 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
elements. 
2. 
On 
account 
of 
common 
fire, 
and 
chiefly 
subterraneous 
fires 
(which 
are 
the 
most 
remote 
and 
most 
completely 
separate 
from 
the 
rays 
of 
heavenly 
bodies), 
reject 
the 
nature 
of 
heavenly 
bodies. 
3. 
On 
account 
of 
the 
warmth 
acquired 
by 
all 
kinds 
of 
bodies 
(minerals, 
vegetables, 
skin 
of 
animals, 
water, 
oil, 
air, 
and 
the 
rest) 
by 
mere 
approach 
to 
a 
fire, 
or 
other 
hot 
body, 
reject 
the 
distinctive 
or 
more 
subtle 
texture 
of 
bodies. 

4. 
On 
account 
of 
ignited 
iron 
and 
other 
metals, 
which 
communicate 
heat 
to 
other 
bodies 
and 
yet 
lose 
none 
of 
their 
weight 
or 
substance, 
reject 
the 
communication 
or 
admixture 
of 
the 
substance 
of 
another 
hot 
body. 
5. 
On 
account 
of 
boiling 
water 
and 
air, 
and 
also 
on 
account 
of 
metals 
and 
other 
solids 
that 
receive 
heat 
but 
not 
to 
ignition 
or 
red 
heat, 
reject 
light 
or 
brightness. 
6. 
On 
account 
of 
the 
rays 
of 
the 
moon 
and 
other 
heavenly 
bodies, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
sun, 
also 
reject 
light 
and 
brightness. 
7. 
By 
a 
comparison 
of 
ignited 
iron 
and 
the 
flame 
of 
spirit 
of 
wine 
(of 
which 
ignited 
iron 
has 
more 
heat 
and 
less 
brightness, 
while 
the 
flame 
of 
spirit 
of 
wine 
has 
more 
brightness 
and 
less 
heat), 
also 
reject 
light 
and 
brightness. 
8. 
On 
account 
of 
ignited 
gold 
and 
other 
metals, 
which 
are 
of 
the 
greatest 
density 
as 
a 
whole, 
reject 
rarity. 
9. 
On 
account 
of 
air, 
which 
is 
found 
for 
the 
most 
part 
cold 
and 
yet 
remains 
rare, 
also 
reject 
rarity. 
10. 
On 
account 
of 
ignited 
iron, 
which 
does 
not 
swell 
in 
bulk, 
but 
keeps 
within 
the 
same 
visible 
dimensions, 
reject 
local 
or 
expansive 
motion 
of 
the 
body 
as 
a 
whole. 
11. 
On 
account 
of 
the 
dilation 
of 
air 
in 
calendar 
glasses 
and 
the 
like, 
wherein 
the 
air 
evidently 
moves 
locally 
and 
expansively 
and 
yet 
acquires 
no 
manifest 
increase 
of 
heat, 
also 
reject 
local 
or 
expansive 
motion 
of 
the 
body 
as 
a 
whole. 
12. 
On 
account 
of 
the 
ease 
with 
which 
all 
bodies 
are 
heated, 
without 
any 
destruction 
or 
observable 
alteration, 
reject 
a 
destructive 
nature, 
or 
the 
violent 
communication 
of 
any 
new 
nature. 
13. 
On 
account 
of 
the 
agreement 
and 
conformity 
of 
the 
similar 
effects 
which 
are 
wrought 
by 
heat 
and 
cold, 
reject 
motion 
of 
the 
body 
as 
a 
whole, 
whether 
expansive 
or 
contractive. 
14. 
On 
account 
of 
heat 
being 
kindled 
by 
the 
attrition 
of 
bodies, 
reject 
a 
principial 
nature. 
By 
principial 
nature 
I 
mean 
that 
which 
exists 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
positively, 
and 
not 
as 
the 
effect 
of 
any 
antecedent 
nature. 
There 
are 
other 
natures 
beside 
these; 
for 
these 
tables 
are 
not 
perfect, 



but 
meant 
only 
for 
examples. 


All 
and 
each 
of 
the 
above-mentioned 
natures 
do 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
form 
of 
heat. 
And 
from 
all 
of 
them 
man 
is 
freed 
in 
his 
operations 
of 
heat. 


XIX 


In 
the 
process 
of 
exclusion 
are 
laid 
the 
foundations 
of 
true 
induction, 
which 
however 
is 
not 
completed 
till 
it 
arrives 
at 
an 
affirmative. 
Nor 
is 
the 
exclusive 
part 
itself 
at 
all 
complete, 
nor 
indeed 
can 
it 
possibly 
be 
so 
at 
first. 
For 
exclusion 
is 
evidently 
the 
rejection 
of 
simple 
natures; 
and 
if 
we 
do 
not 
yet 
possess 
sound 
and 
true 
notions 
of 
simple 
natures, 
how 
can 
the 
process 
of 
exclusion 
be 
made 
accurate? 
Now 
some 
of 
the 
above-mentioned 
notions 
(as 
that 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
elements, 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
heavenly 
bodies, 
of 
rarity) 
are 
vague 
and 
ill 
defined. 
I, 
therefore, 
well 
knowing 
and 
nowise 
forgetting 
how 
great 
a 
work 
I 
am 
about 
(viz., 
that 
of 
rendering 
the 
human 
understanding 
a 
match 
for 
things 
and 
nature), 
do 
not 
rest 
satisfied 
with 
the 
precepts 
I 
have 
laid 
down, 
but 
proceed 
further 
to 
devise 
and 
supply 
more 
powerful 
aids 
for 
the 
use 
of 
the 
understanding; 
which 
I 
shall 
now 
subjoin. 
And 
assuredly 
in 
the 
interpretation 
of 
nature 
the 
mind 
should 
by 
all 
means 
be 
so 
prepared 
and 
disposed 
that 
while 
it 
rests 
and 
finds 
footing 
in 
due 
stages 
and 
degrees 
of 
certainty, 
it 
may 
remember 
withal 
(especially 
at 
the 
beginning) 
that 
what 
it 
has 
before 
it 
depends 
in 
great 
measure 
upon 
what 
remains 
behind. 


XX 


And 
yet 
since 
truth 
will 
sooner 
come 
out 
from 
error 
than 
from 
confusion, 
I 
think 
it 
expedient 
that 
the 
understanding 
should 
have 
permission, 
after 
the 
three 
Tables 
of 
First 
Presentation 
(such 
as 
I 
have 
exhibited) 
have 
been 
made 
and 
weighed, 
to 
make 
an 
essay 
of 
the 
Interpretation 
of 
Nature 
in 
the 
affirmative 
way, 
on 
the 
strength 
both 
of 
the 
instances 
given 
in 
the 
tables, 
and 
of 
any 
others 
it 
may 
meet 
with 
elsewhere. 
Which 
kind 
of 
essay 
I 
call 
the 
Indulgence 
of 
the 
Understanding 
, 
or 
the 
Commencement 
of 
Interpretation 
, 
or 
the 
First 
Vintage 
. 


First 
Vintage 
Concerning 
the 
Form 
of 
Heat 


It 
is 
to 
be 
observed 
that 
the 
form 
of 
a 
thing 
is 
to 
be 
found 
(as 
plainly 



appears 
from 
what 
has 
been 
said) 
in 
each 
and 
all 
the 
instances 
in 
which 
the 
thing 
itself 
is 
to 
be 
found; 
otherwise 
it 
would 
not 
be 
the 
form. 
It 
follows 
therefore 
that 
there 
can 
be 
no 
contradictory 
instance. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
the 
form 
is 
found 
much 
more 
conspicuous 
and 
evident 
in 
some 
instances 
than 
in 
others, 
namely 
in 
those 
wherein 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
form 
is 
less 
restrained 
and 
obstructed 
and 
kept 
within 
bounds 
by 
other 
natures. 
Instances 
of 
this 
kind 
I 
call 
Shining 
or 
Striking 
Instances. 
Let 
us 
now 
therefore 
proceed 
to 
the 
first 
vintage 
concerning 
the 
form 
of 
heat. 


From 
a 
survey 
of 
the 
instances, 
all 
and 
each, 
the 
nature 
of 
which 
heat 
is 
a 
particular 
case, 
appears 
to 
be 
motion. 
This 
is 
displayed 
most 
conspicuously 
in 
flame, 
which 
is 
always 
in 
motion, 
and 
in 
boiling 
or 
simmering 
liquids, 
which 
also 
are 
in 
perpetual 
motion. 
It 
is 
also 
shown 
in 
the 
excitement 
or 
increase 
of 
heat 
caused 
by 
motion, 
as 
in 
bellows 
and 
blasts; 
on 
which 
see 
Tab. 
3. 
Inst. 
29.; 
and 
again 
in 
other 
kinds 
of 
motion, 
on 
which 
see 
Tab. 
3. 
Inst. 
28. 
and 
31. 
Again 
it 
is 
shown 
in 
the 
extinction 
of 
fire 
and 
heat 
by 
any 
strong 
compression, 
which 
checks 
and 
stops 
the 
motion; 
on 
which 
see 
Tab. 
3. 
Inst. 
30. 
and 
32. 
It 
is 
shown 
also 
by 
this, 
that 
all 
bodies 
are 
destroyed, 
or 
at 
any 
rate 
notably 
altered, 
by 
all 
strong 
and 
vehement 
fire 
and 
heat; 
whence 
it 
is 
quite 
clear 
that 
heat 
causes 
a 
tumult 
and 
confusion 
and 
violent 
motion 
in 
the 
internal 
parts 
of 
a 
body, 
which 
perceptibly 
tend 
to 
its 
dissolution. 


When 
I 
say 
of 
motion 
that 
it 
is 
as 
the 
genus 
of 
which 
heat 
is 
a 
species, 
I 
would 
be 
understood 
to 
mean 
not 
that 
heat 
generates 
motion 
or 
that 
motion 
generates 
heat 
(though 
both 
are 
true 
in 
certain 
cases), 
but 
that 
heat 
itself, 
its 
essence 
and 
quiddity, 
is 
motion 
and 
nothing 
else; 
limited 
however 
by 
the 
specific 
differences 
which 
I 
will 
presently 
subjoin, 
as 
soon 
as 
I 
have 
added 
a 
few 
cautions 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
avoiding 
ambiguity. 


Sensible 
heat 
is 
a 
relative 
notion, 
and 
has 
relation 
to 
man, 
not 
to 
the 
universe, 
and 
is 
correctly 
defined 
as 
merely 
the 
effect 
of 
heat 
on 
the 
animal 
spirits. 
Moreover, 
in 
itself 
it 
is 
variable, 
since 
the 
same 
body, 
according 
as 
the 
senses 
are 
predisposed, 
induces 
a 
perception 
of 
cold 
as 
well 
as 
of 
heat. 
This 
is 
clear 
from 
Inst. 
41. 
Tab. 
3. 


Nor 
again 
must 
the 
communication 
of 
heat, 
or 
its 
transitive 
nature, 
by 
means 
of 
which 
a 
body 
becomes 
hot 
when 
a 
hot 
body 
is 
applied 
to 
it, 
be 
confounded 
with 
the 
form 
of 
heat. 
For 
heat 
is 
one 
thing, 
heating 
another. 



Heat 
is 
produced 
by 
the 
motion 
of 
attrition 
without 
any 
preceding 
heat, 
an 
instance 
which 
excludes 
heating 
from 
the 
form 
of 
heat. 
And 
even 
when 
heat 
is 
produced 
by 
the 
approach 
of 
a 
hot 
body, 
this 
does 
not 
proceed 
from 
the 
form 
of 
heat, 
but 
depends 
entirely 
on 
a 
higher 
and 
more 
general 
nature, 
viz., 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
assimilation 
or 
self-multiplication, 
a 
subject 
which 
requires 
a 
separate 
inquiry. 


Again, 
our 
notion 
of 
fire 
is 
popular, 
and 
of 
no 
use, 
being 
made 
up 
of 
the 
combination 
in 
any 
body 
of 
heat 
and 
brightness, 
as 
in 
common 
flame 
and 
bodies 
heated 
to 
redness. 


Having 
thus 
removed 
all 
ambiguity, 
I 
come 
at 
length 
to 
the 
true 
specific 
differences 
which 
limit 
motion 
and 
constitute 
it 
the 
form 
of 
heat. 


The 
first 
difference 
then 
is 
this. 
Heat 
is 
an 
expansive 
motion 
whereby 
a 
body 
strives 
to 
dilate 
and 
stretch 
itself 
to 
a 
larger 
sphere 
or 
dimension 
than 
it 
had 
previously 
occupied. 
This 
difference 
is 
most 
observable 
in 
flame, 
where 
the 
smoke 
or 
thick 
vapor 
manifestly 
dilates 
and 
expands 
itself 
into 
flame. 


It 
is 
shown 
also 
in 
all 
boiling 
liquid 
which 
manifestly 
swells, 
rises, 
and 
bubbles, 
and 
carries 
on 
the 
process 
of 
self-expansion 
till 
it 
turns 
into 
a 
body 
far 
more 
extended 
and 
dilated 
than 
the 
liquid 
itself, 
namely, 
into 
vapor, 
smoke, 
or 
air. 


It 
appears 
likewise 
in 
all 
wood 
and 
combustibles, 
from 
which 
there 
generally 
arises 
exudation 
and 
always 
evaporation. 


It 
is 
shown 
also 
in 
the 
melting 
of 
metals 
which, 
being 
of 
the 
compactest 
texture, 
do 
not 
readily 
swell 
and 
dilate, 
but 
yet 
their 
spirit 
being 
dilated 
in 
itself, 
and 
thereupon 
conceiving 
an 
appetite 
for 
further 
dilation, 
forces 
and 
agitates 
the 
grosser 
parts 
into 
a 
liquid 
state. 
And 
if 
the 
heat 
be 
greatly 
increased 
it 
dissolves 
and 
turns 
much 
of 
their 
substance 
to 
a 
volatile 
state. 


It 
is 
shown 
also 
in 
iron 
or 
stones 
which, 
though 
not 
melted 
or 
dissolved, 
are 
yet 
softened. 
This 
is 
the 
case 
also 
with 
sticks, 
which 
when 
slightly 
heated 
in 
hot 
ashes 
become 
flexible. 


But 
this 
kind 
of 
motion 
is 
best 
seen 
in 
air, 
which 
continuously 
and 
manifestly 
dilates 
with 
a 
slight 
heat, 
as 
appears 
in 
Inst. 
38. 
Tab. 
3. 



It 
is 
shown 
also 
in 
the 
opposite 
nature 
of 
cold. 
For 
cold 
contracts 
all 
bodies 
and 
makes 
them 
shrink, 
insomuch 
that 
in 
intense 
frosts 
nails 
fall 
out 
from 
walls, 
brazen 
vessels 
crack, 
and 
heated 
glass, 
on 
being 
suddenly 
placed 
in 
the 
cold, 
cracks 
and 
breaks. 
In 
like 
manner 
air 
is 
contracted 
by 
a 
slight 
chill, 
as 
in 
Inst. 
38. 
Tab. 
3. 
But 
on 
these 
points 
I 
shall 
speak 
more 
at 
length 
in 
the 
inquiry 
concerning 
Cold. 
Nor 
is 
it 
surprising 
that 
heat 
and 
cold 
should 
exhibit 
many 
actions 
in 
common 
(for 
which 
see 
Inst. 
32. 
Tab. 
2.), 
when 
we 
find 
two 
of 
the 
following 
specific 
differences 
(of 
which 
I 
shall 
speak 
presently) 
suiting 
nature; 
though 
in 
this 
specific 
difference 
(of 
which 
I 
am 
now 
speaking) 
their 
actions 
are 
diametrically 
opposite. 
For 
heat 
gives 
an 
expansive 
and 
dilating, 
cold 
a 
contractive 
and 
condensing 
motion. 


The 
second 
difference 
is 
a 
modification 
of 
the 
former, 
namely, 
that 
heat 
is 
a 
motion 
expansive 
or 
toward 
the 
circumference, 
but 
with 
this 
condition, 
that 
the 
body 
has 
at 
the 
same 
time 
a 
motion 
upward. 
For 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
there 
are 
many 
mixed 
motions. 
For 
instance, 
an 
arrow 
or 
dart 
turns 
as 
it 
goes 
forward, 
and 
goes 
forward 
as 
it 
turns. 
And 
in 
like 
manner 
the 
motion 
of 
heat 
is 
at 
once 
a 
motion 
of 
expansion 
and 
a 
motion 
upward. 
This 
difference 
is 
shown 
by 
putting 
a 
pair 
of 
tongs 
or 
a 
poker 
in 
the 
fire. 
If 
you 
put 
it 
in 
perpendicularly 
and 
hold 
it 
by 
the 
top, 
it 
soon 
burns 
your 
hand; 
if 
at 
the 
side 
or 
from 
below, 
not 
nearly 
so 
soon. 


It 
is 
also 
observable 
in 
distillations 
per 
descensorium 
, 
which 
men 
use 
for 
delicate 
flowers 
that 
soon 
lose 
their 
scent. 
For 
human 
industry 
has 
discovered 
the 
plan 
of 
placing 
the 
fire 
not 
below 
but 
above, 
that 
it 
may 
burn 
the 
less. 
For 
not 
only 
flame 
tends 
upward, 
but 
also 
all 
heat. 


But 
let 
trial 
be 
made 
of 
this 
in 
the 
opposite 
nature 
of 
cold, 
viz., 
whether 
cold 
does 
not 
contract 
a 
body 
downward 
as 
heat 
dilates 
a 
body 
upward. 
Take 
therefore 
two 
iron 
rods, 
or 
two 
glass 
tubes, 
exactly 
alike; 
warm 
them 
a 
little 
and 
place 
a 
sponge 
steeped 
in 
cold 
water 
or 
snow 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
one, 
and 
the 
same 
at 
the 
top 
of 
the 
other. 
For 
I 
think 
that 
the 
extremities 
of 
the 
rod 
which 
has 
the 
snow 
at 
the 
top 
will 
cool 
sooner 
than 
the 
extremities 
of 
the 
other 
which 
has 
the 
snow 
at 
the 
bottom; 
just 
as 
the 
opposite 
is 
the 
case 
with 
heat. 


The 
third 
specific 
difference 
is 
this: 
that 
heat 
is 
a 
motion 
of 
expansion, 
not 
uniformly 
of 
the 
whole 
body 
together, 
but 
in 
the 
smaller 
parts 
of 
it; 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
checked, 
repelled, 
and 
beaten 
back, 
so 
that 
the 



body 
acquires 
a 
motion 
alternative, 
perpetually 
quivering, 
striving 
and 
struggling, 
and 
irritated 
by 
repercussion, 
whence 
springs 
the 
fury 
of 
fire 
and 
heat. 


This 
specific 
difference 
is 
most 
displayed 
in 
flame 
and 
boiling 
liquids, 
which 
are 
perpetually 
quivering 
and 
swelling 
in 
small 
portions, 
and 
again 
subsiding. 


It 
is 
also 
shown 
in 
those 
bodies 
which 
are 
so 
compact 
that 
when 
heated 
or 
ignited 
they 
do 
not 
swell 
or 
expand 
in 
bulk, 
as 
ignited 
iron, 
in 
which 
the 
heat 
is 
very 
sharp. 


It 
is 
shown 
also 
in 
this, 
that 
a 
fire 
burns 
most 
briskly 
in 
the 
coldest 
weather. 


Again, 
it 
is 
shown 
in 
this, 
that 
when 
the 
air 
is 
extended 
in 
a 
calendar 
glass 
without 
impediment 
or 
repulsion 
— 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
uniformly 
and 
equably 
— 
there 
is 
no 
perceptible 
heat. 
Also 
when 
wind 
escapes 
from 
confinement, 
although 
it 
burst 
forth 
with 
the 
greatest 
violence, 
there 
is 
no 
very 
great 
heat 
perceptible; 
because 
the 
motion 
is 
of 
the 
whole, 
without 
a 
motion 
alternating 
in 
the 
particles. 
And 
with 
a 
view 
to 
this, 
let 
trial 
be 
made 
whether 
flame 
does 
not 
burn 
more 
sharply 
toward 
the 
sides 
than 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
flame. 


It 
is 
also 
shown 
in 
this, 
that 
all 
burning 
acts 
on 
minute 
pores 
of 
the 
body 
burnt; 
so 
that 
burning 
undermines, 
penetrates, 
pricks, 
and 
stings 
the 
body 
like 
the 
points 
of 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
needles. 
It 
is 
also 
an 
effect 
of 
this, 
that 
all 
strong 
waters 
(if 
suited 
to 
the 
body 
on 
which 
they 
are 
acting) 
act 
as 
fire 
does, 
in 
consequence 
of 
their 
corroding 
and 
pungent 
nature. 


And 
this 
specific 
difference 
(of 
which 
I 
am 
now 
speaking) 
is 
common 
also 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
cold. 
For 
in 
cold 
the 
contractive 
motion 
is 
checked 
by 
a 
resisting 
tendency 
to 
expand, 
just 
as 
in 
heat 
the 
expansive 
motion 
is 
checked 
by 
a 
resisting 
tendency 
to 
contract. 
Thus, 
whether 
the 
particles 
of 
a 
body 
work 
inward 
or 
outward, 
the 
mode 
of 
action 
is 
the 
same 
though 
the 
degree 
of 
strength 
be 
very 
different; 
because 
we 
have 
not 
here 
on 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
earth 
anything 
that 
is 
intensely 
cold. 
See 
Inst. 
27. 
Tab. 
[1]. 


The 
fourth 
specific 
difference 
is 
a 
modification 
of 
the 
last: 
it 
is, 
that 
the 
preceding 
motion 
of 
stimulation 
or 
penetration 
must 
be 
somewhat 
rapid 
and 
not 
sluggish, 
and 
must 
proceed 
by 
particles, 
minute 
indeed, 
yet 
not 
the 



finest 
of 
all, 
but 
a 
degree 
larger. 


This 
difference 
is 
shown 
by 
a 
comparison 
of 
the 
effects 
of 
fire 
with 
the 
effects 
of 
time 
or 
age. 
Age 
or 
time 
dries, 
consumes, 
undermines 
and 
reduces 
to 
ashes, 
no 
less 
than 
fire; 
indeed, 
with 
an 
action 
far 
more 
subtle; 
but 
because 
such 
motion 
is 
very 
sluggish, 
and 
acts 
on 
particles 
very 
small, 
the 
heat 
is 
not 
perceived. 


It 
is 
also 
shown 
by 
comparing 
the 
dissolution 
of 
iron 
and 
gold. 
Gold 
is 
dissolved 
without 
any 
heat 
being 
excited, 
while 
the 
dissolution 
of 
iron 
is 
accompanied 
by 
a 
violent 
heat, 
though 
it 
takes 
place 
in 
about 
the 
same 
time. 
The 
reason 
is 
that 
in 
gold 
the 
separating 
acid 
enters 
gently 
and 
works 
with 
subtlety, 
and 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
gold 
yield 
easily; 
whereas 
in 
iron 
the 
entrance 
is 
rough 
and 
with 
conflict, 
and 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
iron 
have 
greater 
obstinacy. 


It 
is 
shown 
also 
to 
some 
degree 
in 
some 
gangrenes 
and 
mortifications, 
which 
do 
not 
excite 
great 
heat 
or 
pain 
on 
account 
of 
the 
subtle 
nature 
of 
putrefaction. 


Let 
this 
then 
be 
the 
First 
Vintage 
or 
Commencement 
of 
Interpretation 
concerning 
the 
form 
of 
heat, 
made 
by 
way 
of 
indulgence 
to 
the 
understanding. 


Now 
from 
this 
our 
First 
Vintage 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
form 
or 
true 
definition 
of 
heat 
(heat, 
that 
is, 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
universe, 
not 
simply 
in 
relation 
to 
man) 
is, 
in 
few 
words, 
as 
follows: 
Heat 
is 
a 
motion, 
expansive, 
restrained, 
and 
acting 
in 
its 
strife 
upon 
the 
smaller 
particles 
of 
bodies 
. 
But 
the 
expansion 
is 
thus 
modified: 
while 
it 
expands 
all 
ways, 
it 
has 
at 
the 
same 
time 
an 
inclination 
upward 
. 
And 
the 
struggle 
in 
the 
particles 
is 
modified 
also; 
it 
is 
not 
sluggish, 
but 
hurried 
and 
with 
violence 
. 


Viewed 
with 
reference 
to 
operation 
it 
is 
the 
same 
thing. 
For 
the 
direction 
is 
this: 
If 
in 
any 
natural 
body 
you 
can 
excite 
a 
dilating 
or 
expanding 
motion, 
and 
can 
so 
repress 
this 
motion 
and 
turn 
it 
back 
upon 
itself 
that 
the 
dilation 
shall 
not 
proceed 
equably, 
but 
have 
its 
way 
in 
one 
part 
and 
be 
counteracted 
in 
another, 
you 
will 
undoubtedly 
generate 
heat; 
without 
taking 
into 
account 
whether 
the 
body 
be 
elementary 
(as 
it 
is 
called) 
or 
subject 
to 
celestial 
influence; 
whether 
it 
be 
luminous 
or 
opaque; 
rare 
or 
dense; 
locally 
expanded 
or 
confined 
within 
the 
bounds 
of 
its 
first 
dimension; 
verging 
to 
dissolution 
or 
remaining 
in 
its 
original 
state; 
animal, 
vegetable, 
or 
mineral, 



water, 
oil 
or 
air, 
or 
any 
other 
substance 
whatever 
susceptible 
of 
the 
above-
mentioned 
motion. 
Sensible 
heat 
is 
the 
same 
thing; 
only 
it 
must 
be 
considered 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
sense. 
Let 
us 
now 
proceed 
to 
further 
aids. 


XXI 


The 
Tables 
of 
First 
Presentation 
and 
the 
Rejection 
or 
process 
of 
Exclusion 
being 
completed, 
and 
also 
the 
First 
Vintage 
being 
made 
thereupon, 
we 
are 
to 
proceed 
to 
the 
other 
helps 
of 
the 
understanding 
in 
the 
Interpretation 
of 
Nature 
and 
true 
and 
perfect 
Induction. 
In 
propounding 
which, 
I 
mean, 
when 
Tables 
are 
necessary, 
to 
proceed 
upon 
the 
Instances 
of 
Heat 
and 
Cold; 
but 
when 
a 
smaller 
number 
of 
examples 
will 
suffice, 
I 
shall 
proceed 
at 
large; 
so 
that 
the 
inquiry 
may 
be 
kept 
clear, 
and 
yet 
more 
room 
be 
left 
for 
the 
exposition 
of 
the 
system. 


I 
propose 
to 
treat, 
then, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
of 
Prerogative 
Instances 
; 
secondly, 
of 
the 
Supports 
of 
Induction 
; 
thirdly, 
of 
the 
Rectification 
of 
Induction 
; 
fourthly, 
of 
Varying 
the 
Investigation 
according 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
Subject 
; 
fifthly, 
of 
Prerogative 
Natures 
with 
respect 
to 
Investigation 
, 
or 
of 
what 
should 
be 
inquired 
first 
and 
what 
last; 
sixthly, 
of 
the 
Limits 
of 
Investigation 
, 
or 
a 
synopsis 
of 
all 
natures 
in 
the 
universe; 
seventhly, 
of 
the 
Application 
to 
Practice 
, 
or 
of 
things 
in 
their 
relation 
to 
man; 
eighthly, 
of 
Preparations 
for 
Investigation 
; 
and 
lastly, 
of 
the 
Ascending 
and 
Descending 
Scale 
of 
Axioms 
. 


XXII 


Among 
Prerogative 
Instances 
I 
will 
place 
first 
Solitary 
Instances. 
Those 
are 
solitary 
instances 
which 
exhibit 
the 
nature 
under 
investigation 
in 
subjects 
which 
have 
nothing 
in 
common 
with 
other 
subjects 
except 
that 
nature; 
or, 
again, 
which 
do 
not 
exhibit 
the 
nature 
under 
investigation 
in 
subjects 
which 
resemble 
other 
subjects 
in 
every 
respect 
in 
not 
having 
that 
nature. 
For 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
such 
instances 
make 
the 
way 
short, 
and 
accelerate 
and 
strengthen 
the 
process 
of 
exclusion, 
so 
that 
a 
few 
of 
them 
are 
as 
good 
as 
many. 


For 
instance, 
if 
we 
are 
inquiring 
into 
the 
nature 
of 
color, 
prisms, 



crystals, 
which 
show 
colors 
not 
only 
in 
themselves 
but 
externally 
on 
a 
wall, 
dews, 
etc., 
are 
solitary 
instances. 
For 
they 
have 
nothing 
in 
common 
with 
the 
colors 
fixed 
in 
flowers, 
colored 
stones, 
metals, 
woods, 
etc., 
except 
the 
color. 
From 
which 
we 
easily 
gather 
that 
color 
is 
nothing 
more 
than 
a 
modification 
of 
the 
image 
of 
light 
received 
upon 
the 
object, 
resulting 
in 
the 
former 
case 
from 
the 
different 
degrees 
of 
incidence, 
in 
the 
latter 
from 
the 
various 
textures 
and 
configurations 
of 
the 
body. 
These 
instances 
are 
solitary 
in 
respect 
to 
resemblance. 


Again, 
in 
the 
same 
investigation, 
the 
distinct 
veins 
of 
white 
and 
black 
in 
marble, 
and 
the 
variegation 
of 
color 
in 
flowers 
of 
the 
same 
species, 
are 
solitary 
instances. 
For 
the 
black 
and 
white 
streaks 
in 
marble, 
or 
the 
spots 
of 
pink 
and 
white 
in 
a 
pink, 
agree 
in 
everything 
almost 
except 
the 
color. 
From 
which 
we 
easily 
gather 
that 
color 
has 
little 
to 
do 
with 
the 
intrinsic 
nature 
of 
a 
body, 
but 
simply 
depends 
on 
the 
coarser 
and 
as 
it 
were 
mechanical 
arrangement 
of 
the 
parts. 
These 
instances 
are 
solitary 
in 
respect 
to 
difference. 
Both 
kinds 
I 
call 
solitary 
instances 
, 
or 
ferine 
, 
to 
borrow 
a 
term 
from 
astronomers. 


XXIII 


Among 
Prerogative 
Instances 
I 
will 
next 
place 
Migratory 
Instances 
. 
They 
are 
those 
in 
which 
the 
nature 
in 
question 
is 
in 
the 
process 
of 
being 
produced 
when 
it 
did 
not 
previously 
exist, 
or 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
of 
disappearing 
when 
it 
existed 
before. 
And 
therefore, 
in 
either 
transition, 
such 
instances 
are 
always 
twofold, 
or 
rather 
it 
is 
one 
instance 
in 
motion 
or 
passage, 
continued 
till 
it 
reaches 
the 
opposite 
state. 
Such 
instances 
not 
only 
accelerate 
and 
strengthen 
the 
exclusive 
process, 
but 
also 
drive 
the 
affirmative 
or 
form 
itself 
into 
a 
narrow 
compass. 
For 
the 
form 
of 
a 
thing 
must 
necessarily 
be 
something 
which 
in 
the 
course 
of 
this 
migration 
is 
communicated, 
or 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
which 
in 
the 
course 
of 
this 
migration 
is 
removed 
and 
destroyed. 
And 
though 
every 
exclusion 
promotes 
the 
affirmative, 
yet 
this 
is 
done 
more 
decidedly 
when 
it 
occurs 
in 
the 
same 
than 
in 
different 
subjects. 
And 
the 
betrayal 
of 
the 
form 
in 
a 
single 
instance 
leads 
the 
way 
(as 
is 
evident 
from 
all 
that 
has 
been 
said) 
to 
the 
discovery 
of 
it 
in 
all. 
And 
the 
simpler 
the 
migration, 
the 
more 
must 
the 
instance 
be 
valued. 
Besides, 
migratory 
instances 
are 
of 
great 
use 
with 
a 
view 
to 
operation, 
because 
in 
exhibiting 
the 
form 
in 



connection 
with 
that 
which 
causes 
it 
to 
be 
or 
not 
to 
be, 
they 
supply 
a 
clear 
direction 
for 
practice 
in 
some 
cases; 
whence 
the 
passage 
is 
easy 
to 
the 
cases 
that 
lie 
next. 
There 
is, 
however, 
in 
these 
instances 
a 
danger 
which 
requires 
caution; 
viz., 
lest 
they 
lead 
us 
to 
connect 
the 
form 
too 
much 
with 
the 
efficient, 
and 
so 
possess 
the 
understanding, 
or 
at 
least 
touch 
it, 
with 
a 
false 
opinion 
concerning 
the 
form, 
drawn 
from 
a 
view 
of 
the 
efficient/But 
the 
efficient 
is 
always 
understood 
to 
be 
merely 
the 
vehicle 
that 
carries 
the 
form. 
This 
is 
a 
danger, 
however, 
easily 
remedied 
by 
the 
process 
of 
exclusion 
legitimately 
conducted. 


I 
must 
now 
give 
an 
example 
of 
a 
migratory 
instance. 
Let 
the 
nature 
to 
be 
investigated 
be 
whiteness. 
An 
instance 
migrating 
to 
production 
or 
existence 
is 
glass 
whole 
and 
pounded. 
Again, 
simple 
water 
and 
water 
agitated 
into 
froth. 
For 
glass 
and 
water 
in 
their 
simple 
state 
are 
transparent, 
not 
white, 
whereas 
pounded 
glass 
and 
water 
in 
froth 
are 
white, 
not 
transparent. 
We 
must 
therefore 
inquire 
what 
has 
happened 
to 
the 
glass 
or 
water 
from 
this 
migration. 
For 
it 
is 
obvious 
that 
the 
form 
of 
whiteness 
is 
communicated 
and 
conveyed 
by 
that 
pounding 
of 
the 
glass 
and 
that 
agitation 
of 
the 
water. 
We 
find, 
however, 
that 
nothing 
has 
been 
added 
except 
the 
breaking 
up 
of 
the 
glass 
and 
water 
into 
small 
parts, 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
air. 
But 
we 
have 
made 
no 
slight 
advance 
to 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
form 
of 
whiteness 
when 
we 
know 
that 
two 
bodies, 
both 
transparent 
but 
in 
a 
greater 
or 
less 
degree 
(viz., 
air 
and 
water, 
or 
air 
and 
glass), 
do 
when 
mingled 
in 
small 
portions 
together 
exhibit 
whiteness, 
through 
the 
unequal 
refraction 
of 
the 
rays 
of 
light. 


But 
an 
example 
must 
at 
the 
same 
time 
be 
given 
of 
the 
danger 
and 
caution 
to 
which 
I 
alluded. 
For 
at 
this 
point 
it 
might 
readily 
suggest 
itself 
to 
an 
understanding 
led 
astray 
by 
efficient 
causes 
of 
this 
kind, 
that 
air 
is 
always 
required 
for 
the 
form 
of 
whiteness, 
or 
that 
whiteness 
is 
generated 
by 
transparent 
bodies 
only 
— 
notions 
entirely 
false, 
and 
refuted 
by 
numerous 
exclusions. 
Whereas 
it 
will 
be 
found 
that 
(setting 
air 
and 
the 
like 
aside) 
bodies 
entirely 
even 
in 
the 
particles 
which 
affect 
vision 
are 
transparent, 
bodies 
simply 
uneven 
are 
white; 
bodies 
uneven 
and 
in 
a 
compound 
yet 
regular 
texture 
are 
all 
colors 
except 
black; 
while 
bodies 
uneven 
and 
in 
a 
compound, 
irregular, 
and 
confused 
texture 
are 
black. 
Here 
then 
I 
have 
given 
an 
example 
of 
an 
instance 
migrating 
to 
production 
or 
existence 
in 
the 
proposed 
nature 
of 
whiteness. 
An 
instance 
migrating 
to 
destruction 
in 
the 
same 
nature 
of 
whiteness 
is 
froth 
or 
snow 
in 
dissolution. 
For 
the 
water 
puts 



off 
whiteness 
and 
puts 
on 
transparency 
on 
returning 
to 
its 
integral 
state 
without 
air. 


Nor 
must 
I 
by 
any 
means 
omit 
to 
mention 
that 
under 
migratory 
instances 
are 
to 
be 
included 
not 
only 
those 
which 
are 
passing 
toward 
production 
and 
destruction, 
but 
also 
those 
which 
are 
passing 
toward 
increase 
and 
decrease; 
since 
these 
also 
help 
to 
discover 
the 
form, 
as 
is 
clear 
from 
the 
above 
definition 
of 
form 
and 
the 
Table 
of 
Degrees. 
The 
paper, 
which 
is 
white 
when 
dry, 
but 
when 
wetted 
(that 
is, 
when 
air 
is 
excluded 
and 
water 
introduced) 
is 
less 
white 
and 
approaches 
nearer 
to 
the 
transparent, 
is 
analogous 
to 
the 
above 
given 
instances. 


XXIV 


Among 
Prerogative 
Instances 
I 
will 
put 
in 
the 
third 
place 
Striking 
Instances 
, 
of 
which 
I 
have 
made 
mention 
in 
the 
First 
Vintage 
Concerning 
Heat, 
and 
which 
I 
also 
call 
Shining 
Instances 
, 
or 
Instances 
Freed 
and 
Predominant 
. 
They 
are 
those 
which 
exhibit 
the 
nature 
in 
question 
naked 
and 
standing 
by 
itself, 
and 
also 
in 
its 
exaltation 
or 
highest 
degree 
of 
power; 
as 
being 
disenthralled 
and 
freed 
from 
all 
impediments, 
or 
at 
any 
rate 
by 
virtue 
of 
its 
strength 
dominant 
over, 
suppressing 
and 
coercing 
them. 
For 
since 
every 
body 
contains 
in 
itself 
many 
forms 
of 
natures 
united 
together 
in 
a 
concrete 
state, 
the 
result 
is 
that 
they 
severally 
crush, 
depress, 
break, 
and 
enthrall 
one 
another, 
and 
thus 
the 
individual 
forms 
are 
obscured. 
But 
certain 
subjects 
are 
found 
wherein 
the 
required 
nature 
appears 
more 
in 
its 
vigor 
than 
in 
others, 
either 
through 
the 
absence 
of 
impediments 
or 
the 
predominance 
of 
its 
own 
virtue. 
And 
instances 
of 
this 
kind 
strikingly 
display 
the 
form. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
in 
these 
instances 
also 
we 
must 
use 
caution, 
and 
check 
the 
hurry 
of 
the 
understanding. 
For 
whatever 
displays 
the 
form 
too 
conspicuously 
and 
seems 
to 
force 
it 
on 
the 
notice 
of 
the 
understanding 
should 
be 
held 
suspect, 
and 
recourse 
be 
had 
to 
a 
rigid 
and 
careful 
exclusion. 


To 
take 
an 
example: 
let 
the 
nature 
inquired 
into 
be 
heat. 
A 
striking 
instance 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
expansion, 
which 
(as 
stated 
above) 
is 
the 
main 
element 
in 
the 
form 
of 
heat, 
is 
a 
calendar 
glass 
of 
air. 
For 
flame, 
though 
it 
manifestly 
exhibits 
expansion, 
still, 
as 
susceptible 
of 
momentary 
extinction, 
does 
not 
display 
the 
progress 
of 
expansion. 
Boiling 
water, 
too, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
easy 
transition 
of 
water 
to 
vapor 
or 
air, 
does 
not 
so 
well 
exhibit 
the 



expansion 
of 
water 
in 
its 
own 
body. 
Again, 
ignited 
iron 
and 
like 
bodies 
are 
so 
far 
from 
displaying 
the 
progress 
of 
expansion 
that 
in 
consequence 
of 
their 
spirit 
being 
crushed 
and 
broken 
by 
the 
coarse 
and 
compact 
particles 
which 
curb 
and 
subdue 
it, 
the 
expansion 
itself 
is 
not 
at 
all 
conspicuous 
to 
the 
senses. 
But 
a 
calendar 
glass 
strikingly 
displays 
expansion 
in 
air, 
at 
once 
conspicuous, 
progressive, 
permanent, 
and 
without 
transition. 


To 
take 
another 
example: 
let 
the 
nature 
inquired 
into 
be 
weight. 
A 
striking 
instance 
of 
weight 
is 
quicksilver. 
For 
it 
far 
surpasses 
in 
weight 
all 
substances 
but 
gold, 
and 
gold 
itself 
is 
not 
much 
heavier. 
But 
quicksilver 
is 
a 
better 
instance 
for 
indicating 
the 
form 
of 
weight 
than 
gold, 
because 
gold 
is 
solid 
and 
consistent, 
characteristics 
which 
seem 
related 
to 
density; 
whereas 
quicksilver 
is 
liquid 
and 
teeming 
with 
spirit, 
and 
yet 
is 
heavier 
by 
many 
degrees 
than 
the 
diamond 
and 
other 
bodies 
that 
are 
esteemed 
the 
most 
solid. 
From 
which 
it 
is 
obvious 
that 
the 
form 
of 
heaviness 
or 
weight 
depends 
simply 
on 
quantity 
of 
matter 
and 
not 
on 
compactness 
of 
frame. 


XXV 


Among 
Prerogative 
Instances 
I 
will 
put 
in 
the 
fourth 
place 
Clandestine 
Instances 
, 
which 
I 
also 
call 
Instances 
of 
the 
Twilight 
, 
and 
which 
are 
pretty 
nearly 
the 
opposites 
of 
Striking 
Instances. 
For 
they 
exhibit 
the 
nature 
under 
investigation 
in 
its 
lowest 
degree 
of 
power, 
and 
as 
it 
were 
in 
its 
cradle 
and 
rudiments; 
striving 
indeed 
and 
making 
a 
sort 
of 
first 
attempt, 
but 
buried 
under 
and 
subdued 
by 
a 
contrary 
nature. 
Such 
instances, 
however, 
are 
of 
very 
great 
service 
for 
the 
discovery 
of 
forms; 
because 
as 
striking 
instances 
lead 
easily 
to 
specific 
differences, 
so 
are 
clandestine 
instances 
the 
best 
guides 
to 
genera 
, 
that 
is, 
to 
those 
common 
natures 
whereof 
the 
natures 
proposed 
are 
nothing 
more 
than 
particular 
cases. 


For 
example, 
let 
the 
nature 
proposed 
be 
consistency, 
or 
the 
nature 
of 
that 
which 
determines 
its 
own 
figure, 
opposed 
to 
which 
is 
fluidity. 
Those 
are 
clandestine 
instances 
which 
exhibit 
some 
feeble 
and 
low 
degree 
of 
consistency 
in 
a 
fluid: 
as 
a 
bubble 
of 
water, 
which 
is 
a 
sort 
of 
consistent 
pellicle 
of 
determined 
figure, 
made 
of 
the 
body 
of 
the 
water. 
Of 
a 
similar 
kind 
are 
the 
droppings 
from 
a 
house, 
which 
if 
there 
be 
water 
to 
follow, 
lengthen 
themselves 
out 
into 
a 
very 
thin 
thread 
to 
preserve 
the 
continuity 
of 
the 
water; 
but 
if 
there 
be 
not 
water 
enough 
to 
follow, 
then 
they 
fall 
in 
round 
drops, 



which 
is 
the 
figure 
that 
best 
preserves 
the 
water 
from 
a 
solution 
of 
continuity. 
But 
at 
the 
very 
moment 
of 
time 
when 
the 
thread 
of 
water 
ceases 
and 
the 
descent 
in 
drops 
begins, 
the 
water 
itself 
recoils 
upward 
to 
avoid 
discontinuation. 
Again 
in 
metals, 
which 
in 
fusion 
are 
liquid 
but 
more 
tenacious, 
the 
molten 
drops 
often 
fly 
to 
the 
top 
and 
stick 
there. 
A 
somewhat 
similar 
instance 
is 
that 
of 
children's 
looking 
glasses, 
which 
little 
boys 
make 
on 
rushes 
with 
spittle, 
where 
also 
there 
is 
seen 
a 
consistent 
pellicle 
of 
water. 
This, 
however, 
is 
much 
better 
shown 
in 
that 
other 
childish 
sport 
when 
they 
take 
water, 
made 
a 
little 
more 
tenacious 
by 
soap, 
and 
blow 
it 
through 
a 
hollow 
reed, 
and 
so 
shape 
the 
water 
into 
a 
sort 
of 
castle 
of 
bubbles 
which 
by 
the 
interposition 
of 
the 
air 
become 
so 
consistent 
as 
to 
admit 
of 
being 
thrown 
some 
distance 
without 
discontinuation. 
But 
best 
of 
all 
is 
it 
seen 
in 
frost 
and 
snow, 
which 
assume 
such 
a 
consistency 
that 
they 
can 
be 
almost 
cut 
with 
a 
knife, 
although 
they 
are 
formed 
out 
of 
air 
and 
water, 
both 
fluids. 
All 
which 
facts 
not 
obscurely 
intimate 
that 
consistent 
and 
fluid 
are 
only 
vulgar 
notions, 
and 
relative 
to 
the 
sense; 
and 
that 
in 
fact 
there 
is 
inherent 
in 
all 
bodies 
a 
disposition 
to 
shun 
and 
escape 
discontinuation; 
but 
that 
it 
is 
faint 
and 
feeble 
in 
homogeneous 
bodies 
(as 
fluids), 
more 
lively 
and 
strong 
in 
bodies 
compounded 
of 
heterogeneous 
matter; 
the 
reason 
being 
that 
the 
approach 
of 
heterogeneous 
matter 
binds 
bodies 
together, 
while 
the 
insinuation 
of 
homogeneous 
matter 
dissolves 
and 
relaxes 
them. 


To 
take 
another 
instance, 
let 
the 
proposed 
nature 
be 
the 
attraction 
or 
coming 
together 
of 
bodies. 
In 
the 
investigation 
of 
its 
form 
the 
most 
remarkable 
striking 
instance 
is 
the 
magnet. 
But 
there 
is 
a 
contrary 
nature 
to 
the 
attractive; 
namely, 
the 
nonattractive, 
which 
exists 
in 
a 
similar 
substance. 
Thus 
there 
is 
iron 
which 
does 
not 
attract 
iron, 
just 
as 
lead 
does 
not 
attract 
lead, 
nor 
wood 
wood, 
nor 
water 
water. 
Now 
a 
clandestine 
instance 
is 
a 
magnet 
armed 
with 
iron, 
or 
rather 
the 
iron 
in 
an 
armed 
magnet. 
For 
it 
is 
a 
fact 
in 
nature 
that 
an 
armed 
magnet 
at 
some 
distance 
off 
does 
not 
attract 
iron 
more 
powerfully 
than 
an 
unarmed 
magnet. 
But 
if 
the 
iron 
be 
brought 
so 
near 
as 
to 
touch 
the 
iron 
in 
the 
armed 
magnet, 
then 
the 
armed 
magnet 
supports 
a 
far 
greater 
weight 
of 
iron 
than 
a 
simple 
and 
unarmed 
magnet, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
similarity 
of 
substance 
between 
the 
pieces 
of 
iron; 
an 
operation 
altogether 
clandestine 
and 
latent 
in 
the 
iron 
before 
the 
magnet 
was 
applied. 
Hence 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
the 
form 
of 
coition 
is 
something 
which 
is 
lively 
and 
strong 
in 
the 
magnet, 
feeble 
and 
latent 
in 
iron. 
Again, 
it 
has 
been 
observed 
that 
small 
wooden 
arrows 
without 
an 
iron 
point, 
discharged 
from 
large 
engines, 
pierce 



deeper 
into 
wooden 
material 
(say 
the 
sides 
of 
ships, 
or 
the 
like) 
than 
the 
same 
arrows 
tipped 
with 
iron, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
similarity 
of 
substance 
between 
the 
two 
pieces 
of 
wood; 
although 
this 
property 
had 
previously 
been 
latent 
in 
the 
wood. 
In 
like 
manner, 
although 
air 
does 
not 
manifestly 
attract 
air 
or 
water 
water 
in 
entire 
bodies, 
yet 
a 
bubble 
is 
more 
easily 
dissolved 
on 
the 
approach 
of 
another 
bubble 
than 
if 
that 
other 
bubble 
were 
away, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
appetite 
of 
coition 
between 
water 
and 
water, 
and 
between 
air 
and 
air. 
Such 
clandestine 
instances 
(which, 
as 
I 
have 
said, 
are 
of 
the 
most 
signal 
use) 
exhibit 
themselves 
most 
conspicuously 
in 
small 
and 
subtle 
portions 
of 
bodies; 
the 
reason 
being 
that 
larger 
masses 
follow 
more 
general 
forms, 
as 
shall 
be 
shown 
in 
the 
proper 
place. 


XXVI 


Among 
Prerogative 
Instances 
I 
will 
put 
in 
the 
fifth 
place 
Constitutive 
Instances 
, 
which 
I 
also 
call 
Manipular 
. 
They 
are 
those 
which 
constitute 
a 
single 
species 
of 
the 
proposed 
nature, 
a 
sort 
of 
Lesser 
Form. 
For 
since 
the 
genuine 
forms 
(which 
are 
always 
convertible 
with 
the 
proposed 
natures) 
lie 
deep 
and 
are 
hard 
to 
find, 
it 
is 
required 
by 
the 
circumstances 
of 
the 
case 
and 
the 
infirmity 
of 
the 
human 
understanding 
that 
particular 
forms, 
which 
collect 
together 
certain 
groups 
of 
instances 
(though 
not 
all) 
into 
some 
common 
notion, 
be 
not 
neglected, 
but 
rather 
be 
diligently 
observed. 
For 
whatever 
unites 
nature, 
though 
imperfectly, 
paves 
the 
way 
to 
the 
discovery 
of 
forms. 
Instances, 
therefore, 
which 
are 
useful 
in 
this 
regard 
are 
of 
no 
despicable 
power, 
but 
have 
a 
certain 
prerogative. 


But 
great 
caution 
must 
here 
be 
employed 
lest 
the 
human 
understanding, 
after 
having 
discovered 
many 
of 
those 
particular 
forms 
and 
thereupon 
established 
partitions 
or 
divisions 
of 
the 
nature 
in 
question, 
be 
content 
to 
rest 
therein, 
and 
instead 
of 
proceeding 
to 
the 
legitimate 
discovery 
of 
the 
great 
form, 
take 
it 
for 
granted 
that 
the 
nature 
from 
its 
very 
roots 
is 
manifold 
and 
divided, 
and 
so 
reject 
and 
put 
aside 
any 
further 
union 
of 
the 
nature, 
as 
a 
thing 
of 
superfluous 
subtlety 
and 
verging 
on 
mere 
abstraction. 


For 
example, 
let 
the 
proposed 
nature 
be 
memory, 
or 
that 
which 
excites 
and 
aids 
the 
memory. 
Constitutive 
instances 
are: 
order 
or 
distribution, 
which 
clearly 
aids 
the 
memory; 
also 
topics 
or 
"places" 
in 
artificial 
memory; 
which 
may 
either 
be 
places 
in 
the 
proper 
sense 
of 
the 
word, 
as 
a 
door, 
angle, 



window, 
and 
the 
like; 
or 
familiar 
and 
known 
persons; 
or 
any 
other 
things 
at 
pleasure 
(provided 
they 
be 
placed 
in 
a 
certain 
order), 
as 
animals, 
vegetables; 
words, 
too, 
letters, 
characters, 
historical 
persons, 
and 
the 
like; 
although 
some 
of 
these 
are 
more 
suitable 
and 
convenient 
than 
others. 
Such 
artificial 
places 
help 
the 
memory 
wonderfully, 
and 
exalt 
it 
far 
above 
its 
natural 
powers. 
Again, 
verse 
is 
learned 
and 
remembered 
more 
easily 
than 
prose. 
From 
this 
group 
of 
three 
instances, 
viz., 
order, 
artificial 
places, 
and 
verse, 
one 
species 
of 
aid 
to 
the 
memory 
is 
constituted. 
And 
this 
species 
may 
with 
propriety 
be 
called 
the 
cutting 
off 
of 
infinity. 
For 
when 
we 
try 
to 
recollect 
or 
call 
a 
thing 
to 
mind, 
if 
we 
have 
no 
prenotion 
or 
perception 
of 
what 
we 
are 
seeking, 
we 
seek 
and 
toil 
and 
wander 
here 
and 
there, 
as 
if 
in 
infinite 
space. 
Whereas, 
if 
we 
have 
any 
sure 
prenotion, 
infinity 
is 
at 
once 
cut 
off, 
and 
the 
memory 
has 
not 
so 
far 
to 
range. 
Now 
in 
the 
three 
foregoing 
instances 
the 
prenotion 
is 
clear 
and 
certain. 
In 
the 
first 
it 
must 
be 
something 
which 
suits 
the 
order; 
in 
the 
second 
it 
must 
be 
an 
image 
which 
bears 
some 
relation 
or 
conformity 
to 
the 
places 
fixed; 
in 
the 
third, 
it 
must 
be 
words 
that 
fall 
into 
the 
verse; 
and 
thus 
infinity 
is 
cut 
off. 
Other 
instances, 
again, 
will 
give 
us 
this 
second 
species: 
that 
whatever 
brings 
the 
intellectual 
conception 
into 
contact 
with 
the 
sense 
(which 
is 
indeed 
the 
method 
most 
used 
in 
mnemonics) 
assists 
the 
memory. 
Other 
instances 
will 
give 
us 
this 
third 
species: 
that 
things 
which 
make 
their 
impression 
by 
way 
of 
a 
strong 
affection, 
as 
by 
inspiring 
fear, 
admiration, 
shame, 
delight, 
assist 
the 
memory. 
Other 
instances 
will 
give 
us 
this 
fourth 
species: 
that 
things 
which 
are 
chiefly 
imprinted 
when 
the 
mind 
is 
clear 
and 
not 
occupied 
with 
anything 
else 
either 
before 
or 
after, 
as 
what 
is 
learned 
in 
childhood, 
or 
what 
we 
think 
of 
before 
going 
to 
sleep, 
also 
things 
that 
happen 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
dwell 
longest 
in 
the 
memory. 
Other 
instances 
will 
give 
us 
this 
fifth 
species: 
that 
a 
multitude 
of 
circumstances 
or 
points 
to 
take 
hold 
of 
aids 
the 
memory; 
as 
writing 
with 
breaks 
and 
divisions, 
reading 
or 
reciting 
aloud. 
Lastly, 
other 
instances 
will 
give 
us 
this 
sixth 
species: 
that 
things 
which 
are 
waited 
for 
and 
raise 
the 
attention 
dwell 
longer 
in 
the 
memory 
than 
what 
flies 
quickly 
by. 
Thus, 
if 
you 
read 
anything 
over 
twenty 
times, 
you 
will 
not 
learn 
it 
by 
heart 
so 
easily 
as 
if 
you 
were 
to 
read 
it 
only 
ten, 
trying 
to 
repeat 
it 
between 
whiles, 
and 
when 
memory 
failed, 
looking 
at 
the 
book. 
It 
appears, 
then, 
that 
there 
are 
six 
lesser 
forms 
of 
aids 
to 
the 
memory; 
viz.: 
the 
cutting 
off 
of 
infinity; 
the 
reduction 
of 
the 
intellectual 
to 
the 
sensible; 
impression 
made 
on 
the 
mind 
in 
a 
state 
of 
strong 
emotion; 
impression 
made 
on 
the 
mind 
disengaged; 
multitude 
of 
points 
to 
take 
hold 
of; 
expectation 
beforehand. 



To 
take 
another 
example, 
let 
the 
proposed 
nature 
be 
taste 
or 
tasting. 
The 
following 
instances 
are 
Constitutive. 
Persons 
who 
are 
by 
nature 
without 
the 
sense 
of 
smell 
cannot 
perceive 
or 
distinguish 
by 
taste 
food 
that 
is 
rancid 
or 
putrid, 
nor 
food 
that 
is 
seasoned 
with 
garlic, 
or 
with 
roses, 
or 
the 
like. 
Again, 
persons 
whose 
nostrils 
are 
accidentally 
obstructed 
by 
a 
catarrh 
cannot 
distinguish 
or 
perceive 
anything 
putrid 
or 
rancid 
or 
sprinkled 
with 
rosewater. 
Again, 
persons 
thus 
affected 
with 
catarrh, 
if 
while 
they 
have 
something 
fetid 
or 
perfumed 
in 
their 
mouth 
or 
palate 
they 
blow 
their 
nose 
violently, 
immediately 
perceive 
the 
rancidity 
or 
the 
perfume. 
These 
instances, 
then, 
will 
give 
and 
constitute 
this 
species, 
or 
rather 
division, 
of 
taste: 
that 
the 
sense 
of 
taste 
is 
in 
part 
nothing 
else 
than 
an 
internal 
smell, 
passing 
and 
descending 
from 
the 
upper 
passages 
of 
the 
nose 
to 
the 
mouth 
and 
palate. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
the 
tastes 
of 
salt, 
sweet, 
sour, 
acid, 
rough, 
bitter, 
and 
the 
like, 
are 
as 
perceptible 
to 
those 
in 
whom 
the 
sense 
of 
smell 
is 
wanting 
or 
stopped 
as 
to 
anyone 
else; 
so 
that 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
sense 
of 
taste 
is 
a 
sort 
of 
compound 
of 
an 
internal 
smell 
and 
a 
delicate 
power 
of 
touch 
— 
of 
which 
this 
is 
not 
the 
place 
to 
speak. 


To 
take 
another 
example, 
let 
the 
proposed 
nature 
be 
the 
communication 
of 
quality 
without 
admixture 
of 
substance. 
The 
instance 
of 
light 
will 
give 
or 
constitute 
one 
species 
of 
communication; 
heat 
and 
the 
magnet 
another. 
For 
the 
communication 
of 
light 
is 
momentaneous, 
and 
ceases 
at 
once 
on 
the 
removal 
of 
the 
original 
light. 
But 
heat 
and 
the 
virtue 
of 
the 
magnet, 
after 
they 
have 
been 
transmitted 
to 
or 
rather 
excited 
in 
a 
body, 
lodge 
and 
remain 
there 
for 
a 
considerable 
time 
after 
the 
removal 
of 
the 
source 
of 
motion. 


Very 
great, 
in 
short, 
is 
the 
prerogative 
of 
constitutive 
instances; 
for 
they 
are 
of 
much 
use 
in 
the 
forming 
of 
definitions 
(especially 
particular 
definitions) 
and 
in 
the 
division 
and 
partition 
of 
natures; 
with 
regard 
to 
which 
it 
was 
not 
ill 
said 
by 
Plato, 
"That 
he 
is 
to 
be 
held 
as 
a 
god 
who 
knows 
well 
how 
to 
define 
and 
to 
divide." 


XXVII 


Among 
Prerogative 
Instances 
I 
will 
put 
in 
the 
sixth 
place 
Instances 
Conformable 
, 
or 
of 
Analogy 
; 
which 
I 
also 
call 
Parallels 
, 
or 
Physical 
Resemblances 
. 
They 
are 
those 
which 
represent 
the 
resemblances 
and 



conjugations 
of 
things, 
not 
in 
lesser 
forms 
(as 
constitutive 
instances 
do) 
but 
merely 
in 
the 
concrete. 
Hence 
they 
may 
be 
called 
the 
first 
and 
lowest 
steps 
toward 
the 
union 
of 
nature. 
Nor 
do 
they 
constitute 
any 
axiom 
immediately 
from 
the 
beginning, 
but 
simply 
point 
out 
and 
mark 
a 
certain 
agreement 
in 
bodies. 
But 
although 
they 
are 
of 
little 
use 
for 
the 
discovery 
of 
forms, 
they 
nevertheless 
are 
very 
serviceable 
in 
revealing 
the 
fabric 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
universe, 
and 
anatomizing 
its 
members; 
from 
which 
they 
often 
lead 
us 
along 
to 
sublime 
and 
noble 
axioms, 
especially 
those 
which 
relate 
to 
the 
configuration 
of 
the 
world 
rather 
than 
to 
simple 
forms 
and 
natures. 


For 
example, 
these 
following 
are 
instances 
of 
conformity: 
a 
looking 
glass 
and 
the 
eye; 
and 
again, 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
ear 
and 
places 
returning 
an 
echo. 
From 
which 
conformity, 
to 
say 
nothing 
of 
the 
mere 
observation 
of 
the 
resemblance 
which 
is 
in 
many 
respects 
useful, 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
gather 
and 
form 
this 
axiom 
— 
that 
the 
organs 
of 
the 
senses, 
and 
bodies 
which 
produce 
reflections 
to 
the 
senses, 
are 
of 
a 
like 
nature. 
Again, 
upon 
this 
hint 
the 
understanding 
easily 
rises 
to 
a 
higher 
and 
nobler 
axiom, 
which 
is 
this: 
that 
there 
is 
no 
difference 
between 
the 
consents 
or 
sympathies 
of 
bodies 
endowed 
with 
sensation 
and 
those 
of 
inanimate 
bodies 
without 
sensation, 
except 
that 
in 
the 
former 
an 
animal 
spirit 
is 
added 
to 
the 
body 
so 
disposed, 
but 
is 
wanting 
in 
the 
latter. 
Whence 
it 
follows 
that 
there 
might 
be 
as 
many 
senses 
in 
animals 
as 
there 
are 
sympathies 
between 
inanimate 
bodies, 
if 
there 
were 
perforations 
in 
the 
animate 
body 
allowing 
the 
animal 
spirit 
to 
pass 
freely 
into 
a 
member 
rightly 
disposed, 
as 
into 
a 
fit 
organ. 
Again, 
as 
many 
as 
are 
the 
senses 
in 
animals, 
so 
many 
without 
doubt 
are 
the 
motions 
in 
an 
inanimate 
body 
where 
animal 
spirit 
is 
wanting; 
though 
necessarily 
there 
are 
many 
more 
motions 
in 
inanimate 
bodies 
than 
there 
are 
senses 
in 
animate, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
paucity 
of 
organs 
of 
sense. 
And 
of 
this 
a 
manifest 
example 
is 
exhibited 
in 
pain. 
For 
though 
there 
are 
many 
kinds 
and 
varieties 
of 
pain 
in 
animals 
(as 
the 
pain 
of 
burning, 
for 
one, 
of 
intense 
cold 
for 
another; 
again, 
of 
pricking, 
squeezing, 
stretching, 
and 
the 
like), 
it 
is 
yet 
most 
certain 
that 
all 
of 
them, 
as 
far 
as 
the 
motion 
is 
concerned, 
exist 
in 
inanimate 
substances; 
for 
example, 
in 
wood 
or 
stone, 
when 
it 
is 
burned 
or 
frozen 
or 
pricked 
or 
cut 
or 
bent 
or 
stretched, 
and 
so 
on, 
though 
they 
do 
not 
enter 
the 
senses 
for 
want 
of 
the 
animal 
spirit. 


Again, 
the 
roots 
and 
branches 
of 
plants 
(which 
may 
seem 
strange) 
are 
conformable 
instances. 
For 
all 
vegetable 
matter 
swells 
and 
pushes 
out 
its 
parts 
to 
the 
surface, 
as 
well 
upward 
as 
downward. 
Nor 
is 
there 
any 
other 



difference 
between 
roots 
and 
branches 
than 
that 
the 
root 
is 
buried 
in 
the 
ground, 
while 
the 
branches 
are 
exposed 
to 
the 
air 
and 
sun. 
For 
if 
you 
take 
a 
tender 
and 
flourishing 
branch 
of 
a 
tree, 
and 
bend 
it 
down 
into 
a 
clod 
of 
earth, 
although 
it 
does 
not 
cohere 
with 
the 
ground 
itself, 
it 
presently 
produces 
not 
a 
branch 
but 
a 
root. 
And 
vice 
versa, 
if 
earth 
be 
placed 
at 
the 
top, 
and 
so 
kept 
down 
with 
a 
stone 
or 
any 
hard 
substance 
as 
to 
check 
the 
plant 
and 
prevent 
it 
from 
shooting 
upward, 
it 
will 
put 
forth 
branches 
into 
the 
air 
downward. 


Again, 
the 
gums 
of 
trees, 
and 
most 
rock 
gems, 
are 
conformable 
instances. 
For 
both 
of 
these 
are 
nothing 
else 
than 
exudations 
and 
filterings 
of 
juices, 
the 
former 
from 
trees, 
the 
latter 
from 
rocks; 
whence 
is 
produced 
the 
splendor 
and 
clearness 
in 
each, 
that 
is, 
by 
the 
fine 
and 
delicate 
filtering. 
Hence, 
too, 
it 
is 
that 
the 
hairs 
of 
animals 
are 
not 
generally 
so 
beautiful 
and 
of 
so 
vivid 
a 
color 
as 
the 
feathers 
of 
birds, 
viz., 
because 
the 
juices 
do 
not 
filter 
so 
finely 
through 
skin 
as 
through 
quills. 


Again, 
the 
scrotum 
in 
males 
and 
the 
matrix 
in 
females 
are 
conformable 
instances. 
So 
that 
the 
great 
organic 
difference 
between 
the 
sexes 
(in 
land 
animals 
at 
least) 
appears 
to 
be 
nothing 
more 
than 
that 
the 
one 
organization 
is 
external 
and 
the 
other 
internal. 
That 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
greater 
force 
of 
heat 
in 
the 
male 
thrusts 
the 
genitals 
outward; 
whereas 
in 
the 
female 
the 
heat 
is 
too 
feeble 
to 
effect 
this, 
and 
thus 
they 
are 
contained 
within. 


The 
fins 
of 
fish, 
again, 
and 
the 
feet 
of 
quadrupeds, 
or 
the 
feet 
and 
wings 
of 
birds, 
are 
conformable 
instances; 
to 
which 
Aristotle 
has 
added 
the 
four 
folds 
in 
the 
motions 
of 
serpents. 
Whence 
it 
appears 
that 
in 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
universe 
the 
motions 
of 
living 
creatures 
are 
generally 
effected 
by 
a 
quaternion 
of 
limbs 
or 
of 
bendings. 


Again, 
the 
teeth 
of 
land 
animals 
and 
the 
beaks 
of 
birds 
are 
conformable 
instances; 
from 
which 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
in 
all 
perfect 
animals 
there 
is 
a 
determination 
of 
some 
hard 
substance 
to 
the 
mouth. 


Nor 
is 
that 
an 
absurd 
similitude 
of 
conformity 
which 
has 
been 
remarked 
between 
man 
and 
a 
plant 
inverted. 
For 
the 
root 
of 
the 
nerves 
and 
faculties 
in 
animals 
is 
the 
head, 
while 
the 
seminal 
parts 
are 
the 
lowest 
— 
the 
extremities 
of 
the 
legs 
and 
arms 
not 
reckoned. 
In 
a 
plant, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
root 
(which 
answers 
to 
the 
head) 
is 
regularly 
placed 
in 
the 
lowest 
part, 
and 
the 
seeds 
in 
the 
highest. 



To 
conclude, 
it 
cannot 
too 
often 
be 
recommended 
and 
enjoined 
that 


men's 
diligence 
in 
investigating 
and 
amassing 
natural 
history 
be 
henceforward 
entirely 
changed 
and 
turned 
into 
the 
direction 
opposite 
to 
that 
now 
in 
use. 
For 
hitherto 
men 
have 
used 
great 
and 
indeed 
overcurious 
diligence 
in 
observing 
the 
variety 
of 
things, 
and 
explaining 
the 
exact 
specific 
differences 
of 
animals, 
herbs, 
and 
fossils; 
most 
of 
which 
are 
rather 
sports 
of 
nature 
than 
of 
any 
serious 
use 
toward 
science. 
Such 
things 
indeed 
serve 
to 
delight, 
and 
sometimes 
even 
give 
help 
in 
practice; 
but 
for 
getting 
insight 
into 
nature 
they 
are 
of 
little 
service 
or 
none. 
Men's 
labor 
therefore 
should 
be 
turned 
to 
the 
investigation 
and 
observation 
of 
the 
resemblances 
and 
analogies 
of 
things, 
as 
well 
in 
wholes 
as 
in 
parts. 
For 
these 
it 
is 
that 
detect 
the 
unity 
of 
nature, 
and 
lay 
a 
foundation 
for 
the 
constitution 
of 
sciences. 


But 
here 
must 
be 
added 
a 
strict 
and 
earnest 
caution, 
that 
those 
only 
are 
to 
be 
taken 
for 
conformable 
and 
analogous 
instances 
which 
indicate 
(as 
I 
said 
at 
the 
beginning) 
physical 
resemblances, 
that 
is, 
real 
and 
substantial 
resemblances; 
resemblances 
grounded 
in 
nature, 
not 
accidental 
or 
merely 
apparent; 
much 
less 
superstitious 
or 
curious 
resemblances, 
such 
as 
the 
writers 
on 
natural 
magic 
(very 
frivolous 
persons, 
hardly 
to 
be 
named 
in 
connection 
with 
such 
serious 
matters 
as 
we 
are 
now 
about) 
are 
everywhere 
parading 
— 
similitudes 
and 
sympathies 
of 
things 
that 
have 
no 
reality, 
which 
they 
describe 
and 
sometimes 
invent 
with 
great 
vanity 
and 
folly. 


But 
to 
leave 
these. 
The 
very 
configuration 
of 
the 
world 
itself 
in 
its 
greater 
parts 
presents 
conformable 
instances 
which 
are 
not 
to 
be 
neglected. 
Take, 
for 
example, 
Africa 
and 
the 
region 
of 
Peru 
with 
the 
continent 
stretching 
to 
the 
Straits 
of 
Magellan, 
in 
each 
of 
which 
tracts 
there 
are 
similar 
isthmuses 
and 
similar 
promontories, 
which 
can 
hardly 
be 
by 
accident. 


Again, 
there 
is 
the 
Old 
and 
New 
World, 
both 
of 
which 
are 
broad 
and 
extended 
towards 
the 
north, 
narrow 
and 
pointed 
towards 
the 
south. 


We 
have 
also 
most 
remarkable 
instances 
of 
conformity 
in 
the 
intense 
cold 
existing 
in 
what 
is 
called 
the 
middle 
region 
of 
the 
air 
and 
the 
violent 
fires 
which 
are 
often 
found 
bursting 
forth 
from 
beneath 
the 
ground, 
which 
two 
things 
are 
ultimities 
and 
extremes; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
extreme 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
cold 
toward 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
sky, 
of 
heat 
toward 
the 
bowels 
of 
the 
earth, 
by 
antiperistasis 
or 
the 
rejection 
of 
the 
contrary 
nature. 


Lastly, 
the 
conformity 
of 
instances 
in 
the 
axioms 
of 
science 
is 



deserving 
of 
notice. 
Thus 
the 
rhetorical 
trope 
of 
deceiving 
expectation 
is 
conformable 
with 
the 
musical 
trope 
of 
avoiding 
or 
sliding 
from 
the 
close 
or 
cadence; 
the 
mathematical 
postulate 
that 
if 
two 
things 
are 
equal 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
they 
are 
equal 
to 
one 
another 
is 
conformable 
with 
the 
rule 
of 
the 
syllogism 
in 
logic 
which 
unites 
propositions 
agreeing 
in 
a 
middle 
term. 
In 
fine, 
a 
certain 
sagacity 
in 
investigating 
and 
hunting 
out 
physical 
conformities 
and 
similitudes 
is 
of 
very 
great 
use 
in 
very 
many 
cases. 


XXVIII 


Among 
Prerogative 
Instances 
I 
will 
put 
in 
the 
seventh 
place 
Singular 
Instances 
, 
which 
I 
also 
call 
Irregular 
or 
Heteroclite 
, 
to 
borrow 
a 
term 
from 
grammarians. 
They 
are 
such 
as 
exhibit 
bodies 
in 
the 
concrete, 
which 
seem 
to 
be 
out 
of 
the 
course 
and 
broken 
off 
from 
the 
order 
of 
nature, 
and 
not 
agreeing 
with 
other 
bodies 
of 
the 
same 
kind. 
For 
conformable 
instances 
are 
like 
each 
other; 
singular 
instances 
are 
like 
themselves 
alone. 
The 
use 
of 
singular 
instances 
is 
the 
same 
as 
that 
of 
clandestine, 
namely, 
to 
raise 
and 
unite 
nature 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
discovering 
kinds 
of 
common 
natures, 
to 
be 
afterward 
limited 
by 
true 
specific 
differences. 
For 
we 
are 
not 
to 
give 
up 
the 
investigation 
until 
the 
properties 
and 
qualities 
found 
in 
such 
things 
as 
may 
be 
taken 
for 
miracles 
of 
nature 
be 
reduced 
and 
comprehended 
under 
some 
form 
or 
fixed 
law, 
so 
that 
all 
the 
irregularity 
or 
singularity 
shall 
be 
found 
to 
depend 
on 
some 
common 
form, 
and 
the 
miracle 
shall 
turn 
out 
to 
be 
only 
in 
the 
exact 
specific 
differences, 
and 
the 
degree, 
and 
the 
rare 
concurrence, 
not 
in 
the 
species 
itself. 
Whereas 
now 
the 
thoughts 
of 
men 
go 
no 
further 
than 
to 
pronounce 
such 
things 
the 
secrets 
and 
mighty 
works 
of 
nature, 
things 
as 
it 
were 
causeless, 
and 
exceptions 
to 
general 
rules. 


Examples 
of 
singular 
instances 
are 
the 
sun 
and 
moon 
among 
stars; 
the 
magnet 
among 
stones; 
quicksilver 
among 
metals; 
the 
elephant 
among 
quadrupeds; 
the 
venereal 
sense 
among 
kinds 
of 
touch; 
the 
scent 
of 
hounds 
among 
kinds 
of 
smell. 
So 
among 
grammarians 
the 
letter 
S 
is 
held 
singular, 
on 
account 
of 
its 
easy 
combination 
with 
consonants, 
sometimes 
with 
two, 
sometimes 
even 
with 
three, 
which 
property 
no 
other 
letter 
has. 
Such 
instances 
must 
be 
regarded 
as 
most 
valuable, 
because 
they 
sharpen 
and 
quicken 
investigation 
and 
help 
to 
cure 
the 
understanding 
depraved 
by 
custom 
and 
the 
common 
course 
of 
things. 



XXIX 


Among 
Prerogative 
Instances 
I 
will 
put 
in 
the 
eighth 
place 
Deviating 
Instances 
, 
that 
is, 
errors, 
vagaries, 
and 
prodigies 
of 
nature, 
wherein 
nature 
deviates 
and 
turns 
aside 
from 
her 
ordinary 
course. 
Errors 
of 
nature 
differ 
from 
singular 
instances 
in 
this, 
that 
the 
latter 
are 
prodigies 
of 
species, 
the 
former 
of 
individuals. 
Their 
use 
is 
pretty 
nearly 
the 
same, 
for 
they 
correct 
the 
erroneous 
impressions 
suggested 
to 
the 
understanding 
by 
ordinary 
phenomena, 
and 
reveal 
common 
forms. 
For 
in 
these 
also 
we 
are 
not 
to 
desist 
from 
inquiry 
until 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
deviation 
is 
discovered. 
This 
cause, 
however, 
does 
not 
rise 
properly 
to 
any 
form, 
but 
simply 
to 
the 
latent 
process 
that 
leads 
to 
the 
form. 
For 
he 
that 
knows 
the 
ways 
of 
nature 
will 
more 
easily 
observe 
her 
deviations; 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
he 
that 
knows 
her 
deviations 
will 
more 
accurately 
describe 
her 
ways. 


They 
differ 
in 
this 
also 
from 
singular 
instances, 
that 
they 
give 
much 
more 
help 
to 
practice 
and 
the 
operative 
part. 
For 
to 
produce 
new 
species 
would 
be 
very 
difficult, 
but 
to 
vary 
known 
species 
and 
thereby 
produce 
many 
rare 
and 
unusual 
results 
is 
less 
difficult. 
Now 
it 
is 
an 
easy 
passage 
from 
miracles 
of 
nature 
to 
miracles 
of 
art. 
For 
if 
nature 
be 
once 
detected 
in 
her 
deviation, 
and 
the 
reason 
thereof 
made 
evident, 
there 
will 
be 
little 
difficulty 
in 
leading 
her 
back 
by 
art 
to 
the 
point 
whither 
she 
strayed 
by 
accident; 
and 
that 
not 
only 
in 
one 
case, 
but 
also 
in 
others. 
For 
errors 
on 
one 
side 
point 
out 
and 
open 
the 
way 
to 
errors 
and 
deflections 
on 
all 
sides. 
Under 
this 
head 
there 
is 
no 
need 
of 
examples, 
they 
are 
so 
plentiful. 
For 
we 
have 
to 
make 
a 
collection 
or 
particular 
natural 
history 
of 
all 
prodigies 
and 
monstrous 
births 
of 
nature; 
of 
everything 
in 
short 
that 
is 
in 
nature 
new, 
rare, 
and 
unusual. 
This 
must 
be 
done, 
however, 
with 
the 
strictest 
scrutiny, 
that 
fidelity 
may 
be 
ensured. 
Now 
those 
things 
are 
to 
be 
chiefly 
suspected 
which 
depend 
in 
any 
way 
on 
religion, 
as 
the 
prodigies 
of 
Livy, 
and 
those 
not 
less 
which 
are 
found 
in 
writers 
on 
natural 
magic 
or 
alchemy, 
and 
men 
of 
that 
sort, 
who 
are 
a 
kind 
of 
suitors 
and 
lovers 
of 
fables. 
But 
whatever 
is 
admitted 
must 
be 
drawn 
from 
grave 
and 
credible 
history 
and 
trustworthy 
reports. 


XXX 



Among 
Prerogative 
Instances 
I 
will 
put 
in 
the 
ninth 
place 
Bordering 
Instances 
, 
which 
I 
also 
call 
Participles 
. 
They 
are 
those 
which 
exhibit 
species 
of 
bodies 
that 
seem 
to 
be 
composed 
of 
two 
species, 
or 
to 
be 
rudiments 
between 
one 
species 
and 
another. 
These 
instances 
might 
with 
propriety 
be 
reckoned 
among 
singular 
or 
heteroclite 
instances, 
for 
in 
the 
whole 
extent 
of 
nature 
they 
are 
of 
rare 
and 
extraordinary 
occurrence. 
But 
nevertheless 
for 
their 
worth's 
sake 
they 
should 
be 
ranked 
and 
treated 
separately, 
for 
they 
are 
of 
excellent 
use 
in 
indicating 
the 
composition 
and 
structure 
of 
things, 
and 
suggesting 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
number 
and 
quality 
of 
the 
ordinary 
species 
in 
the 
universe, 
and 
carrying 
on 
the 
understanding 
from 
that 
which 
is 
to 
that 
which 
may 
be. 


Examples 
of 
these 
are: 
moss, 
which 
holds 
a 
place 
between 
putrescence 
and 
a 
plant; 
some 
comets, 
between 
stars 
and 
fiery 
meteors; 
flying 
fish, 
between 
birds 
and 
fish; 
bats, 
between 
birds 
and 
quadrupeds; 
also 
the 
ape, 
between 
man 
and 
beast 
— 


Simia 
quam 
similis 
turpissima 
bestia 
nobis; 


likewise 
the 
biformed 
births 
of 
animals, 
mixed 
of 
different 
species, 
and 
the 
like. 


XXXI 


Among 
Prerogative 
Instances 
I 
will 
put 
in 
the 
tenth 
place 
Instances 
of 
Power 
, 
or 
of 
the 
Fasces 
(to 
borrow 
a 
term 
from 
the 
badges 
of 
empire); 
which 
I 
also 
call 
Instances 
of 
the 
Wit 
, 
or 
Hands 
of 
Man 
. 
These 
are 
the 
noblest 
and 
most 
consummate 
works 
in 
each 
art, 
exhibiting 
the 
ultimate 
perfection 
of 
it. 
For 
since 
our 
main 
object 
is 
to 
make 
nature 
serve 
the 
business 
and 
conveniences 
of 
man, 
it 
is 
altogether 
agreeable 
to 
that 
object 
that 
the 
works 
which 
are 
already 
in 
man's 
power 
should 
(like 
so 
many 
provinces 
formerly 
occupied 
and 
subdued) 
be 
noted 
and 
enumerated, 
especially 
such 
as 
are 
the 
most 
complete 
and 
perfect; 
because 
starting 
from 
them 
we 
shall 
find 
an 
easier 
and 
nearer 
passage 
to 
new 
works 
hitherto 
unattempted. 
For 
if 
from 
an 
attentive 
contemplation 
of 
these 
a 
man 
pushes 
on 
his 
work 
with 
zeal 
and 
activity, 
he 
will 
infallibly 
either 
advance 
them 
a 
little 
further, 
or 
turn 
them 
aside 
to 
something 
in 
their 
neighborhood, 
or 
even 
apply 
and 
transfer 
them 
to 
some 
more 
noble 
use. 



Nor 
is 
this 
all. 
But 
as 
by 
rare 
an 
understanding 
is 
excited 
and 
raised 
to 
th 
forms 
capable 
of 
including 
them, 
so 
also 
wonderful 
works 
of 
art, 
and 
that 
in 
a 
mu 
method 
of 
creating 
and 
constructing 
suc 
plain, 
whereas 
in 
the 
miracles 
of 
nature 
i 
also 
we 
must 
use 
the 
utmost 
caution 
lest 
fasten 
it 
as 
it 
were 
to 
the 
ground. 


For 
there 
is 
danger 
lest 
the 
cont 
which 
appear 
to 
be 
the 
very* 
summits 
an 
industry, 
may 
so 
astonish 
and 
bind 
and 
b 
regard 
to 
them, 
that 
it 
shall 
be 
incapable 
think 
that 
nothing 
can 
be 
done 
in 
that 
kin 
these 
were 
done 
— 
only 
with 
the 
use 
of 
preparation. 


Whereas 
on 
the 
contrary 
this 
is 
achieving 
the 
effects 
and 
works 
hitherto 
most 
part 
very 
poor 
things, 
and 
that 
all 
p 
forms 
and 
is 
derived 
in 
order 
from 
the 
so 
yet 
been 
discovered. 


And 
therefore 
(as 
I 
have 
said 
el 
of 
the 
war 
engines 
and 
battering-rams 
of 
with 
all 
his 
might 
and 
spent 
his 
whole 
lif 
lighted 
on 
the 
discovery 
of 
cannon 
actin 
if 
he 
had 
fixed 
his 
observation 
and 
thoug 
cotton, 
would 
he 
ever 
by 
such 
means 
hav 
silkworm 
or 
of 
silk. 


Hence 
it 
is 
that 
all 
the 
discoveri 
nobler 
of 
their 
kind 
have 
(if 
you 
observe 
elaborations 
and 
extensions 
of 
arts, 
but 
e 
nothing 
which 
can 
forestall 
or 
anticipate 
at 
long 
intervals) 
except 
the 
discovery 
of 


Particular 
examples 
of 
such 
inst 
there 
is 
such 
an 
abundance 
of 
them.

Philosophy 


My 
object 
in 
publishing 
my 
Instauration 
by 
parts 
is 
that 
some 
portion 
of 
it 
may 
be 
put 
out 
of 
peril. 
A 
similar 
reason 
induces 
me 
to 
subjoin 
here 
another 
small 
portion 
of 
the 
work, 
and 
to 
publish 
it 
along 
with 
that 
which 
has 
just 
been 
set 
forth. 
This 
is 
the 
description 
and 
delineation 
of 
a 
natural 
and 
experimental 
history, 
such 
as 
may 
serve 
to 
build 
philosophy 
upon, 
and 
containing 
material 
true 
and 
copious 
and 
aptly 
digested 
for 
the 
work 
of 
the 
interpreter 
which 
follows. 
The 
proper 
place 
for 
it 
would 
be 
when 
I 
come 
in 
due 
course 
to 
the 
"Preparatives" 
of 
Inquiry. 
I 
have 
thought 
it 
better, 
however, 
to 
introduce 
it 
at 
once 
without 
waiting 
for 
that. 
For 
a 
history 
of 
this 
kind, 
such 
as 
I 
conceive 
and 
shall 
presently 
describe, 
is 
a 
thing 
of 
very 
great 
size 
and 
cannot 
be 
executed 
without 
great 
labor 
and 
expense, 
requiring 
as 
it 
does 
many 
people 
to 
help, 
and 
being 
(as 
I 
have 
said 
elsewhere) 
a 
kind 
of 
royal 
work. 
It 
occurs 
to 
me, 
therefore, 
that 
it 
may 
not 
be 
amiss 
to 
try 
if 
there 
be 
any 
others 
who 
will 
take 
these 
matters 
in 
hand, 
so 
that 
while 
I 
go 
on 
with 
the 
completion 
of 
my 
original 
design, 
this 
part 
which 
is 
so 
manifold 
and 
laborious 
may 
even 
during 
my 
life 
(if 
it 
so 
please 
the 
Divine 
Majesty) 
be 
prepared 
and 
set 
forth, 
others 
applying 
themselves 
diligently 
to 
it 
along 
with 
me; 
the 
rather 
because 
my 
own 
strength 
(if 
I 
should 
have 
no 
one 
to 
help 
me) 
is 
hardly 
equal 
to 
such 
a 
province. 
For 
as 
much 
relates 
to 
the 
work 
itself 
of 
the 
intellect, 
I 
shall 
perhaps 
be 
able 
to 
master 
that 
by 
myself; 
but 
the 
materials 
on 
which 
the 
intellect 
has 
to 
work 
are 
so 
widely 
spread 
that 
one 
must 
employ 
factors 
and 
merchants 
to 
go 
everywhere 
in 
search 
of 
them 
and 
bring 
them 
in. 
Besides 
I 
hold 
it 
to 
be 
somewhat 
beneath 
the 
dignity 
of 
an 
undertaking 
like 
mine 
that 
I 
should 
spend 
my 
own 
time 
in 
a 
matter 
which 
is 
open 
to 
almost 
every 
man's 
industry. 
That, 
however, 
which 
is 
the 
main 
part 
of 
the 
matter 
I 
will 
myself 
now 
supply, 
by 
diligently 
and 
exactly 
setting 
forth 
the 
method 
and 
description 
of 
a 
history 
of 
this 
kind, 
such 
as 
shall 
satisfy 
my 
intention; 
lest 
men 
for 
want 
of 
warning 
set 
to 
work 
the 
wrong 
way 
and 
guide 
themselves 
by 
the 
example 
of 
the 
natural 
histories 
now 
in 
use, 
and 
so 
go 
far 
astray 
from 
my 
design. 
Meanwhile, 
what 
I 
have 
often 
said 
I 
must 
here 
emphatically 
repeat: 
that 
if 
all 
the 
wits 
of 
all 
the 
ages 
had 
met 
or 
shall 
hereafter 
meet 
together, 
if 
the 
whole 
human 
race 
had 
applied 
or 
shall 



hereafter 
apply 
themselves 
to 
philosophy, 
and 
the 
whole 
earth 
had 
been 
or 
shall 
be 
nothing 
but 
academies 
and 
colleges 
and 
schools 
of 
learned 
men, 
still 
without 
a 
natural 
and 
experimental 
history 
such 
as 
I 
am 
going 
to 
prescribe, 
no 
progress 
worthy 
of 
the 
human 
race 
could 
have 
been 
made 
or 
can 
be 
made 
in 
philosophy 
and 
the 
sciences. 
Whereas, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
let 
such 
a 
history 
be 
once 
provided 
and 
well 
set 
forth, 
and 
let 
there 
be 
added 
to 
it 
such 
auxiliary 
and 
light-giving 
experiments 
as 
in 
the 
very 
course 
of 
interpretation 
will 
present 
themselves 
or 
will 
have 
to 
be 
found 
out, 
and 
the 
investigation 
of 
nature 
and 
of 
all 
sciences 
will 
be 
the 
work 
of 
a 
few 
years. 
This, 
therefore, 
must 
be 
done 
or 
the 
business 
must 
be 
given 
up. 
For 
in 
this 
way, 
and 
in 
this 
way 
only, 
can 
the 
foundations 
of 
a 
true 
and 
active 
philosophy 
be 
established; 
and 
then 
will 
men 
wake 
as 
from 
deep 
sleep, 
and 
at 
once 
perceive 
what 
a 
difference 
there 
is 
between 
the 
dogmas 
and 
figments 
of 
the 
wit 
and 
a 
true 
and 
active 
philosophy, 
and 
what 
it 
is 
in 
questions 
of 
nature 
to 
consult 
nature 
herself. 


First, 
then, 
I 
will 
give 
general 
precepts 
for 
the 
composition 
of 
this 
history; 
then 
I 
will 
set 
out 
the 
particular 
figure 
of 
it, 
inserting 
sometimes 
as 
well 
the 
purpose 
to 
which 
the 
inquiry 
is 
to 
be 
adapted 
and 
referred 
as 
the 
particular 
point 
to 
be 
inquired 
in 
order 
that 
a 
good 
understanding 
and 
forecast 
of 
the 
mark 
aimed 
at 
may 
suggest 
to 
men's 
minds 
other 
things 
also 
which 
I 
may 
perhaps 
have 
overlooked. 
This 
history 
I 
call 
"Primary 
History," 
or 
the 
"Mother 
History." 



Aphorisms 
on 
the 
Composition 
of 
the 
Primary 
History 


I 


Nature 
exists 
in 
three 
states, 
and 
is 
subject, 
as 
it 
were, 
to 
three 
kinds 
of 
regimen. 
Either 
she 
is 
free 
and 
develops 
herself 
in 
her 
own 
ordinary 
course, 
or 
she 
is 
forced 
out 
of 
her 
proper 
state 
by 
the 
perverseness 
and 
insubordination 
of 
matter 
and 
the 
violence 
of 
impediments, 
or 
she 
is 
constrained 
and 
molded 
by 
art 
and 
human 
ministry. 
The 
first 
state 
refers 
to 
the 
"species" 
of 
things; 
the 
second 
to 
"monsters"; 
the 
third 
to 
"things 
artificial." 
For 
in 
things 
artificial 
nature 
takes 
orders 
from 
man 
and 
works 
under 
his 
authority; 
without 
man, 
such 
things 
would 
never 
have 
been 
made. 
But 
by 
the 
help 
and 
ministry 
of 
man 
a 
new 
face 
of 
bodies, 
another 
universe 
or 
theater 
of 
things, 
comes 
into 
view. 
Natural 
history 
therefore 
is 
threefold. 
It 
treats 
of 
the 
"liberty" 
of 
nature, 
or 
the 
"errors" 
of 
nature, 
or 
the 
"bonds" 
of 
nature, 
so 
that 
we 
may 
fairly 
distribute 
it 
into 
history 
of 
"generations," 
of 
"pretergenerations," 
and 
of 
"arts"; 
which 
last 
I 
also 
call 
"mechanical" 
or 
"experimental" 
history. 
And 
yet 
I 
do 
not 
make 
it 
a 
rule 
that 
these 
three 
should 
be 
kept 
apart 
and 
separately 
treated. 
For 
why 
should 
not 
the 
history 
of 
the 
monsters 
in 
the 
several 
species 
be 
joined 
with 
the 
history 
of 
the 
species 
themselves? 
And 
things 
artificial 
again 
may 
sometimes 
be 
rightly 
joined 
with 
the 
species, 
though 
sometimes 
they 
will 
be 
better 
kept 
separate. 
It 
will 
be 
best, 
therefore, 
to 
consider 
these 
things 
as 
the 
case 
arises. 
For 
too 
much 
method 
produces 
iterations 
and 
prolixity 
as 
well 
as 
none 
at 
all. 


II 


Natural 
history, 
which 
in 
its 
subject 
(as 
I 
said) 
is 
threefold, 
is 
in 
its 
use 
twofold. 
For 
it 
is 
used 
either 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
particular 
things 
which 
it 
contains 
or 
as 
the 
primary 
material 
of 
philosophy 
and 
the 
stuff 
and 
subject 
matter 
of 
true 
induction. 
And 
it 
is 
this 
latter 
which 
is 
now 
in 
hand 
— 
now, 
I 
say, 
for 
the 
first 
time; 
nor 
has 
it 
even 
been 
taken 
in 
hand 
till 
now. 
For 
neither 
Aristotle, 
nor 
Theophrastus, 
nor 
Dioscorides, 
nor 
Gaius 
Plinius 
ever 
set 
this 
before 
them 
as 
the 
end 
of 
natural 
history. 
And 
the 



chief 
part 
of 
the 
matter 
rests 
in 
this, 
that 
they 
who 
shall 
hereafter 
take 
it 
upon 
them 
to 
write 
natural 
history 
should 
bear 
this 
continually 
in 
mind 
— 
that 
they 
ought 
not 
to 
consult 
the 
pleasure 
of 
the 
reader, 
no, 
nor 
even 
that 
utility 
which 
may 
be 
derived 
immediately 
from 
their 
narrations, 
but 
to 
seek 
out 
and 
gather 
together 
such 
store 
and 
variety 
of 
things 
as 
may 
suffice 
for 
the 
formation 
of 
true 
axioms. 
Let 
them 
but 
remember 
this, 
and 
they 
will 
find 
out 
for 
themselves 
the 
method 
in 
which 
the 
history 
should 
be 
composed. 
For 
the 
end 
rules 
the 
method. 


III 


But 
the 
more 
difficult 
and 
laborious 
the 
work 
is, 
the 
more 
ought 
it 
to 
be 
discharged 
of 
matters 
superfluous. 
And 
therefore 
there 
are 
three 
things 
upon 
which 
men 
should 
be 
warned 
to 
be 
sparing 
of 
their 
labor, 
as 
those 
which 
will 
immensely 
increase 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
work 
and 
add 
little 
or 
nothing 
to 
its 
worth. 


First 
then, 
away 
with 
antiquities, 
and 
citations 
or 
testimonies 
of 
authors, 
and 
also 
with 
disputes 
and 
controversies 
and 
differing 
opinions 
— 
everything, 
in 
short, 
which 
is 
philological. 
Never 
cite 
an 
author 
except 
in 
a 
matter 
of 
doubtful 
credit; 
never 
introduce 
a 
controversy 
unless 
in 
a 
matter 
of 
great 
moment. 
And 
for 
all 
that 
concerns 
ornaments 
of 
speech, 
similitudes, 
treasury 
of 
eloquence, 
and 
such 
like 
emptinesses, 
let 
it 
be 
utterly 
dismissed. 
Also 
let 
all 
those 
things 
which 
are 
admitted 
be 
themselves 
set 
down 
briefly 
and 
concisely, 
so 
that 
they 
may 
be 
nothing 
less 
than 
words. 
For 
no 
man 
who 
is 
collecting 
and 
storing 
up 
materials 
for 
ship 
building 
or 
the 
like, 
thinks 
of 
arranging 
them 
elegantly, 
as 
in 
a 
shop, 
and 
displaying 
them 
so 
as 
to 
please 
the 
eye; 
all 
his 
care 
is 
that 
they 
be 
sound 
and 
good, 
and 
that 
they 
be 
so 
arranged 
as 
to 
take 
up 
as 
little 
room 
as 
possible 
in 
the 
warehouse. 
And 
this 
is 
exactly 
what 
should 
be 
done 
here. 


Secondly, 
that 
superfluity 
of 
natural 
histories 
in 
descriptions 
and 
pictures 
of 
species, 
and 
the 
curious 
variety 
of 
the 
same, 
is 
not 
much 
to 
the 
purpose. 
For 
small 
varieties 
of 
this 
kind 
are 
only 
a 
kind 
of 
sports 
and 
wanton 
freaks 
of 
nature 
and 
come 
near 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
individuals. 
They 
afford 
a 
pleasant 
recreation 
in 
wandering 
among 
them 
and 
looking 
at 
them 
as 
objects 
in 
themselves, 
but 
the 
information 
they 
yield 
to 
the 
sciences 
is 
slight 
and 
almost 
superfluous. 



Thirdly, 
all 
superstitious 
stories 
(I 
do 
not 
say 
stories 
of 
prodigies, 
when 
the 
report 
appears 
to 
be 
faithful 
and 
probable, 
but 
superstitious 
stories) 
and 
experiments 
of 
ceremonial 
magic 
should 
be 
altogether 
rejected. 
For 
I 
would 
not 
have 
the 
infancy 
of 
philosophy, 
to 
which 
natural 
history 
is 
as 
a 
nursing 
mother, 
accustomed 
to 
old 
wives' 
fables. 
The 
time 
will 
perhaps 
come 
(after 
we 
have 
gone 
somewhat 
deeper 
into 
the 
investigation 
of 
nature) 
for 
a 
light 
review 
of 
things 
of 
this 
kind, 
that 
if 
there 
remain 
any 
grains 
of 
natural 
virtue 
in 
these 
dregs, 
they 
may 
be 
extracted 
and 
laid 
up 
for 
use. 
In 
the 
meantime 
they 
should 
be 
set 
aside. 
Even 
the 
experiments 
of 
natural 
magic 
should 
be 
sifted 
diligently 
and 
severely 
before 
they 
are 
received, 
especially 
those 
which 
are 
commonly 
derived 
from 
vulgar 
sympathies 
and 
antipathies, 
with 
great 
sloth 
and 
facility 
both 
of 
believing 
and 
inventing. 


And 
it 
is 
no 
small 
thing 
to 
relieve 
natural 
history 
from 
the 
three 
superfluities 
above 
mentioned, 
which 
would 
otherwise 
fill 
volumes. 
Nor 
is 
this 
all. 
For 
in 
a 
great 
work 
it 
is 
no 
less 
necessary 
that 
what 
is 
admitted 
should 
be 
written 
succinctly 
than 
that 
what 
is 
superfluous 
should 
be 
rejected, 
though 
no 
doubt 
this 
kind 
of 
chastity 
and 
brevity 
will 
give 
less 
pleasure 
both 
to 
the 
reader 
and 
the 
writer. 
But 
it 
is 
always 
to 
be 
remembered 
that 
this 
which 
we 
are 
now 
about 
is 
only 
a 
granary 
and 
storehouse 
of 
matters, 
not 
meant 
to 
be 
pleasant 
to 
stay 
or 
live 
in, 
but 
only 
to 
be 
entered 
as 
occasion 
requires, 
when 
anything 
is 
wanted 
for 
the 
work 
of 
the 
interpreter 
which 
follows. 


IV 


In 
the 
history 
which 
I 
require 
and 
design, 
special 
care 
is 
to 
be 
taken 
that 
it 
be 
of 
wide 
range 
and 
made 
to 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
universe. 
For 
the 
world 
is 
not 
to 
be 
narrowed 
till 
it 
will 
go 
into 
the 
understanding 
(which 
has 
been 
done 
hitherto), 
but 
the 
understanding 
to 
be 
expanded 
and 
opened 
till 
it 
can 
take 
in 
the 
image 
of 
the 
world 
as 
it 
is 
in 
fact. 
For 
that 
fashion 
of 
taking 
few 
things 
into 
account, 
and 
pronouncing 
with 
reference 
to 
a 
few 
things, 
has 
been 
the 
ruin 
of 
everything. 
To 
resume 
then 
the 
divisions 
of 
natural 
history 
which 
I 
made 
just 
now 
— 
viz., 
that 
it 
is 
a 
history 
of 
generations, 
Pretergenerations, 
and 
arts 
— 
I 
divide 
the 
history 
of 
generations 
into 
five 
parts. 
The 
first, 
of 
ether 
and 
things 
celestial. 
The 
second, 
of 
meteors 
and 
the 
regions 
(as 
they 
call 
them) 
of 
air, 
viz., 
of 
the 
tracts 
which 
lie 
between 
the 
moon 
and 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
earth; 
to 
which 
part 
also 
(for 
order's 
sake, 



however 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
thing 
may 
be) 
I 
assign 
comets 
of 
whatever 
kind, 
both 
higher 
and 
lower. 
The 
third, 
of 
earth 
and 
sea. 
The 
fourth, 
of 
the 
elements 
(as 
they 
call 
them), 
flame 
or 
fire, 
air, 
water, 
earth, 
understanding, 
however, 
by 
elements, 
not 
the 
first 
principles 
of 
things, 
but 
the 
greater 
masses 
of 
natural 
bodies. 
For 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
is 
so 
distributed 
that 
the 
quantity 
or 
mass 
of 
some 
bodies 
in 
the 
universe 
is 
very 
great, 
because 
their 
configurations 
require 
a 
texture 
of 
matter 
easy 
and 
obvious, 
such 
as 
are 
those 
four 
bodies 
which 
I 
have 
mentioned; 
while 
of 
certain 
other 
bodies 
the 
quantity 
is 
small 
and 
weakly 
supplied, 
because 
the 
texture 
of 
matter 
which 
they 
require 
is 
very 
complex 
and 
subtle, 
and 
for 
the 
most 
part 
determinate 
and 
organic, 
such 
as 
are 
the 
species 
of 
natural 
things 
— 
metals, 
plants, 
animals. 
Hence 
I 
call 
the 
former 
kind 
of 
bodies 
the 
"greater 
colleges," 
the 
latter 
the 
"lesser 
colleges." 
Now 
the 
fourth 
part 
of 
the 
history 
is 
of 
those 
greater 
colleges 
— 
under 
the 
name 
of 
elements, 
as 
I 
said. 
And 
let 
it 
not 
be 
thought 
that 
I 
confound 
this 
fourth 
part 
with 
the 
second 
and 
third, 
because 
in 
each 
of 
them 
I 
have 
mentioned 
air, 
water, 
and 
earth. 
For 
the 
history 
of 
these 
enters 
into 
the 
second 
and 
third, 
as 
they 
are 
integral 
parts 
of 
the 
world, 
and 
as 
they 
relate 
to 
the 
fabric 
and 
configuration 
of 
the 
universe. 
But 
in 
the 
fourth 
is 
contained 
the 
history 
of 
their 
own 
substance 
and 
nature, 
as 
it 
exists 
in 
their 
several 
parts 
of 
uniform 
structure, 
and 
without 
reference 
to 
the 
whole. 
Lastly, 
the 
fifth 
part 
of 
the 
history 
contains 
the 
lesser 
colleges, 
or 
species, 
upon 
which 
natural 
history 
has 
hitherto 
been 
principally 
employed. 


As 
for 
the 
history 
of 
pretergenerations, 
I 
have 
already 
said 
that 
it 
may 
be 
most 
conveniently 
joined 
with 
the 
history 
of 
generations 
— 
I 
mean 
the 
history 
of 
prodigies 
which 
are 
natural. 
For 
the 
superstitious 
history 
of 
marvels 
(of 
whatever 
kind) 
I 
remit 
to 
a 
quite 
separate 
treatise 
of 
its 
own; 
which 
treatise 
I 
do 
not 
wish 
to 
be 
undertaken 
now 
at 
first, 
but 
a 
little 
after, 
when 
the 
investigation 
of 
nature 
has 
been 
carried 
deeper. 


History 
of 
arts, 
and 
of 
nature 
as 
changed 
and 
altered 
by 
man, 
or 
experimental 
history, 
I 
divide 
into 
three. 
For 
it 
is 
drawn 
either 
from 
mechanical 
arts, 
or 
from 
the 
operative 
part 
of 
the 
liberal 
arts, 
or 
from 
a 
number 
of 
crafts 
and 
experiments 
which 
have 
not 
yet 
grown 
into 
an 
art 
properly 
so 
called, 
and 
which 
sometimes 
indeed 
turn 
up 
in 
the 
course 
of 
most 
ordinary 
experience 
and 
do 
not 
stand 
at 
all 
in 
need 
of 
art. 


As 
soon, 
therefore, 
as 
a 
history 
has 
been 
completed 
of 
all 
these 
things 
which 
I 
have 
mentioned 
— 
namely, 
generations, 
pretergenerations, 



arts, 
and 
experiments, 
it 
seems 
that 
nothing 
will 
remain 
unprovided 
whereby 
the 
sense 
can 
be 
equipped 
for 
information 
of 
the 
understanding. 
And 
then 
shall 
we 
be 
no 
longer 
kept 
dancing 
within 
little 
rings, 
like 
persons 
bewitched, 
but 
our 
range 
and 
circuit 
will 
be 
as 
wide 
as 
the 
compass 
of 
the 
world. 


V 


Among 
the 
parts 
of 
history 
which 
I 
have 
mentioned, 
the 
history 
of 
arts 
is 
of 
most 
use 
because 
it 
exhibits 
things 
in 
motion 
and 
leads 
more 
directly 
to 
practice. 
Moreover, 
it 
takes 
off 
the 
mask 
and 
veil 
from 
natural 
objects, 
which 
are 
commonly 
concealed 
and 
obscured 
under 
the 
variety 
of 
shapes 
and 
external 
appearance. 
Finally, 
the 
vexations 
of 
art 
are 
certainly 
as 
the 
bonds 
and 
handcuffs 
of 
Proteus, 
which 
betray 
the 
ultimate 
struggles 
and 
efforts 
of 
matter. 
For 
bodies 
will 
not 
be 
destroyed 
or 
annihilated, 
rather 
than 
that 
they 
will 
turn 
themselves 
into 
various 
forms. 
Upon 
this 
history, 
therefore, 
mechanical 
and 
illiberal 
as 
it 
may 
seem 
(all 
fineness 
and 
daintiness 
set 
aside), 
the 
greatest 
diligence 
must 
be 
bestowed. 


Again, 
among 
the 
particular 
arts 
those 
are 
to 
be 
preferred 
which 
exhibit, 
alter, 
and 
prepare 
natural 
bodies 
and 
materials 
of 
things, 
such 
as 
agriculture, 
cookery, 
chemistry, 
dyeing, 
the 
manufacture 
of 
glass, 
enamel, 
sugar, 
gunpowder, 
artificial 
fires, 
paper, 
and 
the 
like. 
Those 
which 
consist 
principally 
in 
the 
subtle 
motion 
of 
the 
hands 
or 
instruments 
are 
of 
less 
use, 
such 
as 
weaving, 
carpentry, 
architecture, 
manufacture 
of 
mills, 
clocks, 
and 
the 
like, 
although 
these 
too 
are 
by 
no 
means 
to 
be 
neglected, 
both 
because 
many 
things 
occur 
in 
them 
which 
relate 
to 
the 
alterations 
of 
natural 
bodies, 
and 
because 
they 
give 
accurate 
information 
concerning 
local 
motion, 
which 
is 
a 
thing 
of 
great 
importance 
in 
very 
many 
respects. 


But 
in 
the 
whole 
collection 
of 
this 
history 
of 
arts 
it 
is 
especially 
to 
be 
observed 
and 
constantly 
borne 
in 
mind 
that 
not 
only 
those 
experiments 
in 
each 
art 
which 
serve 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
art 
itself 
are 
to 
be 
received, 
but 
likewise 
those 
which 
turn 
up 
anyhow 
by 
the 
way. 
For 
example, 
that 
locusts 
or 
crabs, 
which 
were 
before 
of 
the 
color 
of 
mud, 
turn 
red 
when 
baked 
is 
nothing 
to 
the 
table; 
but 
this 
very 
instance 
is 
not 
a 
bad 
one 
for 
investigating 
the 
nature 
of 
redness, 
seeing 
that 
the 
same 
thing 
happens 
in 
baked 
bricks. 
In 
like 
manner 
the 
fact 
that 
meat 
is 
sooner 
salted 
in 
winter 
than 
in 
summer 
is 
not 
only 
important 
for 
the 
cook 
that 
he 
may 
know 
how 
to 
regulate 
the 
pickling, 
but 
is 



likewise 
a 
good 
instance 
for 
showing 
the 
nature 
and 
impression 
of 
cold. 
Therefore, 
it 
would 
be 
an 
utter 
mistake 
to 
suppose 
that 
my 
intention 
would 
be 
satisfied 
by 
a 
collection 
of 
experiments 
of 
arts 
made 
only 
with 
the 
view 
of 
thereby 
bringing 
the 
several 
arts 
to 
greater 
perfection. 
For 
though 
this 
be 
an 
object 
which 
in 
many 
cases 
I 
do 
not 
despise, 
yet 
my 
meaning 
plainly 
is 
that 
all 
mechanical 
experiments 
should 
be 
as 
streams 
flowing 
from 
all 
sides 
into 
the 
sea 
of 
philosophy. 
But 
how 
to 
select 
the 
more 
important 
instances 
in 
every 
kind 
(which 
are 
principally 
and 
with 
the 
greatest 
diligence 
to 
be 
sought 
and 
as 
it 
were 
hunted 
out) 
is 
a 
point 
to 
be 
learned 
from 
the 
prerogatives 
of 
instances. 


VI 


In 
this 
place 
also 
is 
to 
be 
resumed 
that 
which 
in 
the 
99th, 
119th, 
and 
120th 
aphorisms 
of 
the 
first 
book 
I 
treated 
more 
at 
large, 
but 
which 
it 
may 
be 
enough 
here 
to 
enjoin 
shortly 
by 
way 
of 
precept 
— 
namely, 
that 
there 
are 
to 
be 
received 
into 
this 
history, 
first, 
things 
the 
most 
ordinary, 
such 
as 
it 
might 
be 
thought 
superfluous 
to 
record 
in 
writing 
because 
they 
are 
so 
familiarly 
known; 
secondly, 
things 
mean, 
illiberal, 
filthy 
(for 
"to 
the 
pure 
all 
things 
are 
pure," 
and 
if 
money 
obtained 
from 
Vespasian's 
tax 
smelt 
well, 
much 
more 
does 
light 
and 
information 
from 
whatever 
source 
derived); 
thirdly, 
things 
trifling 
and 
childish 
(and 
no 
wonder, 
for 
we 
are 
to 
become 
again 
as 
little 
children); 
and 
lastly, 
things 
which 
seem 
over 
subtle, 
because 
they 
are 
in 
themselves 
of 
no 
use. 
For 
the 
things 
which 
will 
be 
set 
forth 
in 
this 
history 
are 
not 
collected 
(as 
I 
have 
already 
said) 
on 
their 
own 
account; 
and 
therefore 
neither 
is 
their 
importance 
to 
be 
measured 
by 
what 
they 
are 
worth 
in 
themselves, 
but 
according 
to 
their 
indirect 
bearing 
upon 
other 
things 
and 
the 
influence 
they 
may 
have 
upon 
philosophy. 


VII 


Another 
precept 
is 
that 
everything 
relating 
both 
to 
bodies 
and 
virtues 
in 
nature 
be 
set 
forth 
(as 
far 
as 
may 
be) 
numbered, 
weighed, 
measured, 
defined. 
For 
it 
is 
works 
we 
are 
in 
pursuit 
of, 
not 
speculations; 
and 
practical 
working 
comes 
of 
the 
due 
combination 
of 
physics 
and 
mathematics. 
And 
therefore 
the 
exact 
revolutions 
and 
distances 
of 
the 
planets 
— 
in 
the 
history 



of 
the 
heavenly 
bodies; 
the 
compass 
of 
the 
land 
and 
the 
superficial 
space 
it 
occupies 
in 
comparison 
of 
the 
waters 
— 
in 
the 
history 
of 
earth 
and 
sea; 
how 
much 
compression 
air 
will 
bear 
without 
strong 
resistance 
— 
in 
the 
history 
of 
air; 
how 
much 
one 
metal 
outweighs 
another 
— 
in 
the 
history 
of 
metals; 
and 
numberless 
other 
particulars 
of 
that 
kind 
are 
to 
be 
ascertained 
and 
set 
down. 
And 
when 
exact 
proportions 
cannot 
be 
obtained, 
then 
we 
must 
have 
recourse 
to 
indefinite 
estimates 
and 
comparatives. 
As 
for 
instance 
(if 
we 
happen 
to 
distrust 
the 
calculations 
of 
astronomers 
as 
to 
the 
distances 
of 
the 
planets), 
that 
the 
moon 
is 
within 
the 
shadow 
of 
the 
earth, 
that 
Mercury 
is 
beyond 
the 
moon, 
and 
the 
like. 
Also 
when 
mean 
proportions 
cannot 
be 
had, 
let 
extremes 
be 
proposed, 
as 
that 
a 
weak 
magnet 
will 
raise 
so 
many 
times 
its 
own 
weight 
of 
iron, 
while 
the 
most 
powerful 
will 
raise 
sixty 
times 
its 
own 
weight 
(as 
I 
have 
myself 
seen 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
very 
small 
armed 
magnet). 
I 
know 
well 
enough 
that 
these 
definite 
instances 
do 
not 
occur 
readily 
or 
often, 
but 
that 
they 
must 
be 
sought 
for 
as 
auxiliaries 
in 
the 
course 
of 
interpretation 
itself 
when 
they 
are 
most 
wanted. 
But 
nevertheless 
if 
they 
present 
themselves 
accidentally, 
provided 
they 
do 
not 
too 
much 
interrupt 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
natural 
history, 
they 
should 
also 
be 
entered 
therein. 


VIII 


With 
regard 
to 
the 
credit 
of 
the 
things 
which 
are 
to 
be 
admitted 
into 
the 
history, 
they 
must 
needs 
be 
either 
certainly 
true, 
doubtful 
whether 
true 
or 
not, 
or 
certainly 
not 
true. 
Things 
of 
the 
first 
kind 
should 
be 
set 
down 
simply; 
things 
of 
the 
second 
kind 
with 
a 
qualifying 
note, 
such 
as 
"it 
is 
reported," 
"they 
relate," 
"I 
have 
heard 
from 
a 
person 
of 
credit," 
and 
the 
like. 
For 
to 
add 
the 
arguments 
on 
either 
side 
would 
be 
too 
laborious 
and 
would 
certainly 
interrupt 
the 
writer 
too 
much. 
Nor 
is 
it 
of 
much 
consequence 
to 
the 
business 
in 
hand 
because 
(as 
I 
have 
said 
in 
the 
118th 
aphorism 
of 
the 
first 
book) 
mistakes 
in 
experimenting, 
unless 
they 
abound 
everywhere, 
will 
be 
presently 
detected 
and 
corrected 
by 
the 
truth 
of 
axioms. 
And 
yet 
if 
the 
instance 
be 
of 
importance, 
either 
from 
its 
own 
use 
or 
because 
many 
other 
things 
may 
depend 
upon 
it, 
then 
certainly 
the 
name 
of 
the 
author 
should 
be 
given, 
and 
not 
the 
name 
merely, 
but 
it 
should 
be 
mentioned 
withal 
whether 
he 
took 
it 
from 
report, 
oral 
or 
written 
(as 
most 
of 
Pliny's 
statements 
are), 
or 
rather 
affirmed 
it 
of 
his 
own 
knowledge; 
also 
whether 
it 
was 
a 
thing 
which 
happened 
in 
his 
own 
time 
or 
earlier; 
and 
again, 
whether 
it 
was 
a 
thing 
of 



which, 
if 
it 
really 
happened, 
there 
must 
needs 
have 
been 
many 
witnesses; 
and 
finally, 
whether 
the 
author 
was 
a 
vain-speaking 
and 
light 
person 
or 
sober 
and 
severe; 
and 
the 
like 
points, 
which 
bear 
upon 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
evidence. 
Lastly, 
things 
which 
though 
certainly 
not 
true 
are 
yet 
current 
and 
much 
in 
men's 
mouths, 
having 
either 
through 
neglect 
or 
from 
the 
use 
of 
them 
in 
similitudes 
prevailed 
now 
for 
many 
ages 
(as 
that 
the 
diamond 
binds 
the 
magnet, 
garlic 
weakens 
it, 
that 
amber 
attracts 
everything 
except 
basil, 
and 
other 
things 
of 
that 
kind), 
these 
it 
will 
not 
be 
enough 
to 
reject 
silently; 
they 
must 
be 
in 
express 
words 
proscribed, 
that 
the 
sciences 
may 
be 
no 
more 
troubled 
with 
them. 


Besides, 
it 
will 
not 
be 
amiss, 
when 
the 
source 
of 
any 
vanity 
or 
credulity 
happens 
to 
present 
itself, 
to 
make 
a 
note 
of 
it, 
as, 
for 
example, 
that 
the 
power 
of 
exciting 
Venus 
is 
ascribed 
to 
the 
herb 
Satyrion 
because 
its 
root 
takes 
the 
shape 
of 
testicles 
— 
when 
the 
real 
cause 
of 
this 
is 
that 
a 
fresh 
bulbous 
root 
grows 
upon 
it 
every 
year, 
last 
year's 
root 
still 
remaining; 
whence 
those 
twin 
bulbs. 
And 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
this 
is 
so, 
because 
the 
new 
root 
is 
always 
found 
to 
be 
solid 
and 
succulent, 
the 
old 
withered 
and 
spongy. 
And 
therefore 
it 
is 
no 
marvel 
if 
one 
sinks 
in 
water 
and 
the 
other 
swims 
— 
which 
nevertheless 
goes 
for 
a 
wonder 
and 
has 
added 
credit 
to 
the 
other 
virtues 
ascribed 
to 
this 
herb. 


IX 


There 
are 
also 
some 
things 
which 
may 
be 
usefully 
added 
to 
the 
natural 
history, 
and 
which 
will 
make 
it 
fitter 
and 
more 
convenient 
for 
the 
work 
of 
the 
interpreter, 
which 
follows. 
They 
are 
five. 


First, 
questions 
(I 
do 
not 
mean 
as 
to 
causes 
but 
as 
to 
the 
fact) 
should 
be 
added 
in 
order 
to 
provoke 
and 
stimulate 
further 
inquiry, 
as 
in 
the 
history 
of 
earth 
and 
sea, 
whether 
the 
Caspian 
ebbs 
and 
flows, 
and 
at 
how 
many 
hours' 
interval; 
whether 
there 
is 
any 
southern 
continent 
or 
only 
islands, 
and 
the 
like. 


Secondly, 
in 
any 
new 
and 
more 
subtle 
experiment 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
the 
experiment 
was 
conducted 
should 
be 
added, 
that 
men 
may 
be 
free 
to 
judge 
for 
themselves 
whether 
the 
information 
obtained 
from 
that 
experiment 
be 
trustworthy 
or 
fallacious, 
and 
also 
that 
men's 
industry 
may 
be 
roused 
to 
discover, 
if 
possible, 
methods 
more 
exact. 



Thirdly, 
if 
in 
any 
statement 
there 
be 
anything 
doubtful 
or 
questionable, 
I 
would 
by 
no 
means 
have 
it 
suppressed 
or 
passed 
in 
silence, 
but 
plainly 
and 
perspicuously 
set 
down 
by 
way 
of 
note 
or 
admonition. 
For 
I 
want 
this 
primary 
history 
to 
be 
compiled 
with 
a 
most 
religious 
care, 
as 
if 
every 
particular 
were 
stated 
upon 
oath, 
seeing 
that 
it 
is 
the 
book 
of 
God's 
works 
and 
(so 
far 
as 
the 
majesty 
of 
heavenly 
may 
be 
compared 
with 
the 
humbleness 
of 
earthly 
things) 
a 
kind 
of 
second 
Scripture. 


Fourthly, 
it 
would 
not 
be 
amiss 
to 
intersperse 
observations 
occasionally, 
as 
Pliny 
has 
done; 
as 
in 
the 
history 
of 
earth 
and 
sea, 
that 
the 
figure 
of 
the 
earth 
(as 
far 
as 
it 
is 
yet 
known) 
compared 
with 
the 
seas 
is 
narrow 
and 
pointed 
toward 
the 
south, 
wide 
and 
broad 
toward 
the 
north, 
the 
figure 
of 
the 
sea 
contrary; 
that 
the 
great 
oceans 
intersect 
the 
earth 
in 
channels 
running 
north 
and 
south, 
not 
east 
and 
west, 
except 
perhaps 
in 
the 
extreme 
polar 
regions. 
It 
is 
also 
very 
good 
to 
add 
canons 
(which 
are 
nothing 
more 
than 
certain 
general 
and 
catholic 
observations), 
as 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
heavenly 
bodies, 
that 
Venus 
is 
never 
distant 
more 
than 
46 
parts 
from 
the 
sun, 
Mercury 
never 
more 
than 
23, 
and 
that 
the 
planets 
which 
are 
placed 
above 
the 
sun 
move 
slowest 
when 
they 
are 
furthest 
from 
the 
earth, 
those 
under 
the 
sun 
fastest. 
Moreover, 
there 
is 
another 
kind 
of 
observation 
to 
be 
employed, 
which 
has 
not 
yet 
come 
into 
use, 
though 
it 
be 
of 
no 
small 
importance. 
This 
is, 
that 
to 
the 
enumeration 
of 
things 
which 
are 
should 
be 
subjoined 
an 
enumeration 
of 
things 
which 
are 
not. 
As 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
heavenly 
bodies, 
that 
there 
is 
not 
found 
any 
star 
oblong 
or 
triangular, 
but 
that 
every 
star 
is 
globular 
— 
either 
globular 
simply, 
as 
the 
moon, 
or 
apparently 
angular, 
but 
globular 
in 
the 
middle, 
as 
the 
other 
stars, 
or 
apparently 
radiant 
but 
globular 
in 
the 
middle, 
as 
the 
sun 
— 
or 
that 
the 
stars 
are 
scattered 
about 
the 
sky 
in 
no 
order 
at 
all, 
so 
that 
there 
is 
not 
found 
among 
them 
either 
quincunx 
or 
square, 
or 
any 
other 
regular 
figure 
(howsoever 
the 
names 
be 
given 
of 
Delta, 
Crown, 
Cross, 
Chariot, 
etc.) 
scarcely 
so 
much 
as 
a 
straight 
line, 
except 
perhaps 
in 
the 
belt 
and 
dagger 
of 
Orion. 


Fifthly, 
that 
may 
perhaps 
be 
of 
some 
assistance 
to 
an 
inquirer 
which 
is 
the 
ruin 
and 
destruction 
of 
a 
believer; 
viz., 
a 
brief 
review, 
as 
in 
passage, 
of 
the 
opinions 
now 
received, 
with 
their 
varieties 
and 
sects, 
that 
they 
may 
touch 
and 
rouse 
the 
intellect 
and 
no 
more. 


X 



And 
this 
will 
be 
enough 
in 
the 
way 
of 
general 
precepts 
which, 
if 
they 
be 
diligently 
observed, 
the 
work 
of 
the 
history 
will 
at 
once 
go 
straight 
toward 
its 
object 
and 
be 
prevented 
from 
increasing 
beyond 
bounds. 
But 
if 
even 
as 
here 
circumscribed 
and 
limited 
it 
should 
appear 
to 
some 
poor-spirited 
person 
a 
vast 
work 
— 
let 
him 
turn 
to 
the 
libraries; 
and 
there 
among 
other 
things 
let 
him 
look 
at 
the 
bodies 
of 
civil 
and 
canonical 
law 
on 
one 
side, 
and 
at 
the 
commentaries 
of 
doctors 
and 
lawyers 
on 
the 
other, 
and 
see 
what 
a 
difference 
there 
is 
between 
the 
two 
in 
point 
of 
mass 
and 
volume. 
For 
we 
(who 
as 
faithful 
secretaries 
do 
but 
enter 
and 
set 
down 
the 
laws 
themselves 
of 
nature 
and 
nothing 
else) 
are 
content 
with 
brevity, 
and 
almost 
compelled 
to 
it 
by 
the 
condition 
of 
things; 
whereas 
opinions, 
doctrines, 
and 
speculations 
are 
without 
number 
and 
without 
end. 


And 
whereas 
in 
the 
Plan 
of 
the 
Work 
I 
have 
spoken 
of 
the 
cardinal 
virtues 
in 
nature, 
and 
said 
that 
a 
history 
of 
these 
must 
also 
be 
collected 
and 
written 
before 
we 
come 
to 
the 
work 
of 
Interpretation, 
I 
have 
not 
forgotten 
this, 
but 
I 
reserve 
this 
part 
for 
myself 
since 
until 
men 
have 
begun 
to 
be 
somewhat 
more 
closely 
intimate 
with 
nature, 
I 
cannot 
venture 
to 
rely 
very 
much 
on 
other 
people's 
industry 
in 
that 
matter. 


And 
now 
should 
come 
the 
delineation 
of 
the 
particular 
histories. 
But 
I 
have 
at 
present 
so 
many 
other 
things 
to 
do 
that 
I 
can 
only 
find 
time 
to 
subjoin 
a 
Catalogue 
of 
their 
titles. 
As 
soon, 
however, 
as 
I 
have 
leisure 
for 
it, 
I 
mean 
to 
draw 
up 
a 
set 
of 
questions 
on 
the 
several 
subjects, 
and 
to 
explain 
what 
points 
with 
regard 
to 
each 
of 
the 
histories 
are 
especially 
to 
be 
inquired 
and 
collected, 
as 
conducing 
to 
the 
end 
I 
have 
in 
view 
— 
like 
a 
kind 
of 
particular 
topics. 
In 
other 
words, 
I 
mean 
(according 
to 
the 
practice 
in 
civil 
causes) 
in 
this 
great 
plea 
or 
suit 
granted 
by 
the 
divine 
favor 
and 
providence 
(whereby 
the 
human 
race 
seeks 
to 
recover 
its 
right 
over 
nature), 
to 
examine 
nature 
herself 
and 
the 
arts 
upon 
interrogatories.

mechanical 
arts 
themselves: 
only 
about

contribute

of

But 
these 
things 
will 
be 
better 
regulated 
as 
the 
case 
arises.

OF 
TRUTH 


What 
is 
truth? 
said 
jesting 
Pilate, 
and 
would 
not 
stay 
for 
an 
answer. 
Certainly 
there 
be, 
that 
delight 
in 
giddiness, 
and 
count 
it 
a 
bondage 
to 
fix 
a 
belief; 
affecting 
free-will 
in 
thinking, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
acting. 
And 
though 
the 
sects 
of 
philosophers 
of 
that 
kind 
be 
gone, 
yet 
there 
remain 
certain 
discoursing 
wits, 
which 
are 
of 
the 
same 
veins, 
though 
there 
be 
not 
so 
much 
blood 
in 
them, 
as 
was 
in 
those 
of 
the 
ancients. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
only 
the 
difficulty 
and 
labor, 
which 
men 
take 
in 
finding 
out 
of 
truth, 
nor 
again, 
that 
when 
it 
is 
found, 
it 
imposeth 
upon 
men’s 
thoughts, 
that 
doth 
bring 
lies 
in 
favor; 
but 
a 
natural 
though 
corrupt 
love, 
of 
the 
lie 
itself. 
One 
of 
the 
later 
school 
of 
the 
Grecians, 
examineth 
the 
matter, 
and 
is 
at 
a 
stand, 
to 
think 
what 
should 
be 
in 
it, 
that 
men 
should 
love 
lies; 
where 
neither 
they 
make 
for 
pleasure, 
as 
with 
poets, 
nor 
for 
advantage, 
as 
with 
the 
merchant; 
but 
for 
the 
lie’s 
sake. 
But 
I 
cannot 
tell; 
this 
same 
truth, 
is 
a 
naked, 
and 
open 
day-light, 
that 
doth 
not 
show 
the 
masks, 
and 
mummeries, 
and 
triumphs, 
of 
the 
world, 
half 
so 
stately 
and 
daintily 
as 
candle-lights. 
Truth 
may 
perhaps 
come 
to 
the 
price 
of 
a 
pearl, 
that 
showeth 
best 
by 
day; 
but 
it 
will 
not 
rise 
to 
the 
price 
of 
a 
diamond, 
or 
carbuncle, 
that 
showeth 
best 
in 
varied 
lights. 
A 
mixture 
of 
a 
lie 
doth 
ever 
add 
pleasure. 
Doth 
any 
man 
doubt, 
that 
if 
there 
were 
taken 
out 
of 
men’s 
minds, 
vain 
opinions, 
flattering 
hopes, 
false 
valuations, 
imaginations 
as 
one 
would, 
and 
the 
like, 
but 
it 
would 
leave 
the 
minds, 
of 
a 
number 
of 
men, 
poor 
shrunken 
things, 
full 
of 
melancholy 
and 
indisposition, 
and 
unpleasing 
to 
themselves? 


One 
of 
the 
fathers, 
in 
great 
severity, 
called 
poesy 
vinum 
doemonum, 
because 
it 
filleth 
the 
imagination; 
and 
yet, 
it 
is 
but 
with 
the 
shadow 
of 
a 
lie. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
the 
lie 
that 
passeth 
through 
the 
mind, 
but 
the 
lie 
that 
sinketh 
in, 
and 
settleth 
in 
it, 
that 
doth 
the 
hurt; 
such 
as 
we 
spake 
of 
before. 
But, 
howsoever 
these 
things 
are 
thus 
in 
men’s 
depraved 
judgments, 
and 
affections, 
yet 
truth, 
which 
only 
doth 
judge 
itself, 
teacheth 
that 
the 
inquiry 
of 
truth, 
which 
is 
the 
love-making, 
or 
wooing 
of 
it, 
the 
knowledge 
of 
truth, 
which 
is 
the 
presence 
of 
it, 
and 
the 
belief 
of 
truth, 
which 
is 
the 
enjoying 
of 
it, 
is 
the 
sovereign 
good 
of 
human 
nature. 
The 
first 
creature 
of 
God, 
in 
the 
works 
of 
the 
days, 
was 
the 
light 
of 
the 
sense; 
the 
last, 
was 
the 
light 
of 
reason; 
and 
his 
sabbath 
work 
ever 
since, 
is 
the 
illumination 
of 
his 
Spirit. 
First 
he 
breathed 
light, 
upon 
the 
face 
of 
the 
matter 
or 
chaos; 
then 
he 
breathed 
light, 
into 
the 



face 
of 
man; 
and 
still 
he 
breatheth 
and 
inspireth 
light, 
into 
the 
face 
of 
his 
chosen. 
The 
poet, 
that 
beautified 
the 
sect, 
that 
was 
otherwise 
inferior 
to 
the 
rest, 
saith 
yet 
excellently 
well: 
It 
is 
a 
pleasure, 
to 
stand 
upon 
the 
shore, 
and 
to 
see 
ships 
tossed 
upon 
the 
sea; 
a 
pleasure, 
to 
stand 
in 
the 
window 
of 
a 
castle, 
and 
to 
see 
a 
battle, 
and 
the 
adventures 
thereof 
below: 
but 
no 
pleasure 
is 
comparable 
to 
the 
standing 
upon 
the 
vantage 
ground 
of 
truth 
(a 
hill 
not 
to 
be 
commanded, 
and 
where 
the 
air 
is 
always 
clear 
and 
serene), 
and 
to 
see 
the 
errors, 
and 
wanderings, 
and 
mists, 
and 
tempests, 
in 
the 
vale 
below; 
so 
always 
that 
this 
prospect 
be 
with 
pity, 
and 
not 
with 
swelling, 
or 
pride. 
Certainly, 
it 
is 
heaven 
upon 
earth, 
to 
have 
a 
man’s 
mind 
move 
in 
charity, 
rest 
in 
providence, 
and 
turn 
upon 
the 
poles 
of 
truth. 


To 
pass 
from 
theological, 
and 
philosophical 
truth, 
to 
the 
truth 
of 
civil 
business; 
it 
will 
be 
acknowledged, 
even 
by 
those 
that 
practise 
it 
not, 
that 
clear, 
and 
round 
dealing, 
is 
the 
honor 
of 
man’s 
nature; 
and 
that 
mixture 
of 
falsehoods, 
is 
like 
alloy 
in 
coin 
of 
gold 
and 
silver, 
which 
may 
make 
the 
metal 
work 
the 
better, 
but 
it 
embaseth 
it. 
For 
these 
winding, 
and 
crooked 
courses, 
are 
the 
goings 
of 
the 
serpent; 
which 
goeth 
basely 
upon 
the 
belly, 
and 
not 
upon 
the 
feet. 
There 
is 
no 
vice, 
that 
doth 
so 
cover 
a 
man 
with 
shame, 
as 
to 
be 
found 
false 
and 
perfidious. 
And 
therefore 
Montaigne 
saith 
prettily, 
when 
he 
inquired 
the 
reason, 
why 
the 
word 
of 
the 
lie 
should 
be 
such 
a 
disgrace, 
and 
such 
an 
odious 
charge? 
Saith 
he, 
If 
it 
be 
well 
weighed, 
to 
say 
that 
a 
man 
lieth, 
is 
as 
much 
to 
say, 
as 
that 
he 
is 
brave 
towards 
God, 
and 
a 
coward 
towards 
men. 
For 
a 
lie 
faces 
God, 
and 
shrinks 
from 
man. 
Surely 
the 
wickedness 
of 
falsehood, 
and 
breach 
of 
faith, 
cannot 
possibly 
be 
so 
highly 
expressed, 
as 
in 
that 
it 
shall 
be 
the 
last 
peal, 
to 
call 
the 
judgments 
of 
God 
upon 
the 
generations 
of 
men; 
it 
being 
foretold, 
that 
when 
Christ 
cometh, 
he 
shall 
not 
find 
faith 
upon 
the 
earth. 



OF 
DEATH 


Men 
fear 
death, 
as 
children 
fear 
to 
go 
in 
the 
dark; 
and 
as 
that 
natural 
fear 
in 
children, 
is 
increased 
with 
tales, 
so 
is 
the 
other. 
Certainly, 
the 
contemplation 
of 
death, 
as 
the 
wages 
of 
sin, 
and 
passage 
to 
another 
world, 
is 
holy 
and 
religious; 
but 
the 
fear 
of 
it, 
as 
a 
tribute 
due 
unto 
nature, 
is 
weak. 
Yet 
in 
religious 
meditations, 
there 
is 
sometimes 
mixture 
of 
vanity, 
and 
of 
superstition. 
You 
shall 
read, 
in 
some 
of 
the 
friars’ 
books 
of 
mortification, 
that 
a 
man 
should 
think 
with 
himself, 
what 
the 
pain 
is, 
if 
he 
have 
but 
his 
finger’s 
end 
pressed, 
or 
tortured, 
and 
thereby 
imagine, 
what 
the 
pains 
of 
death 
are, 
when 
the 
whole 
body 
is 
corrupted, 
and 
dissolved; 
when 
many 
times 
death 
passeth, 
with 
less 
pain 
than 
the 
torture 
of 
a 
limb; 
for 
the 
most 
vital 
parts, 
are 
not 
the 
quickest 
of 
sense. 
And 
by 
him 
that 
spake 
only 
as 
a 
philosopher, 
and 
natural 
man, 
it 
was 
well 
said, 
Pompa 
mortis 
magis 
terret, 
quam 
mors 
ipsa. 
Groans, 
and 
convulsions, 
and 
a 
discolored 
face, 
and 
friends 
weeping, 
and 
blacks, 
and 
obsequies, 
and 
the 
like, 
show 
death 
terrible. 
It 
is 
worthy 
the 
observing, 
that 
there 
is 
no 
passion 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
man, 
so 
weak, 
but 
it 
mates, 
and 
masters, 
the 
fear 
of 
death; 
and 
therefore, 
death 
is 
no 
such 
terrible 
enemy, 
when 
a 
man 
hath 
so 
many 
attendants 
about 
him, 
that 
can 
win 
the 
combat 
of 
him. 
Revenge 
triumphs 
over 
death; 
love 
slights 
it; 
honor 
aspireth 
to 
it; 
grief 
flieth 
to 
it; 
fear 
preoccupateth 
it; 
nay, 
we 
read, 
after 
Otho 
the 
emperor 
had 
slain 
himself, 
pity 
(which 
is 
the 
tenderest 
of 
affections) 
provoked 
many 
to 
die, 
out 
of 
mere 
compassion 
to 
their 
sovereign, 
and 
as 
the 
truest 
sort 
of 
followers. 
Nay, 
Seneca 
adds 
niceness 
and 
satiety: 
Cogita 
quamdiu 
eadem 
feceris; 
mori 
velle, 
non 
tantum 
fortis 
aut 
miser, 
sed 
etiam 
fastidiosus 
potest. 
A 
man 
would 
die, 
though 
he 
were 
neither 
valiant, 
nor 
miserable, 
only 
upon 
a 
weariness 
to 
do 
the 
same 
thing 
so 
oft, 
over 
and 
over. 
It 
is 
no 
less 
worthy, 
to 
observe, 
how 
little 
alteration 
in 
good 
spirits, 
the 
approaches 
of 
death 
make; 
for 
they 
appear 
to 
be 
the 
same 
men, 
till 
the 
last 
instant. 
Augustus 
Caesar 
died 
in 
a 
compliment; 
Livia, 
conjugii 
nostri 
memor, 
vive 
et 
vale. 
Tiberius 
in 
dissimulation; 
as 
Tacitus 
saith 
of 
him, 
Jam 
Tiberium 
vires 
et 
corpus, 
non 
dissimulatio, 
deserebant. 
Vespasian 
in 
a 
jest, 
sitting 
upon 
the 
stool; 
Ut 
puto 
deus 
fio. 
Galba 
with 
a 
sentence; 
Feri, 
si 
ex 
re 
sit 
populi 
Romani; 
holding 
forth 
his 
neck. 
Septimius 
Severus 
in 
despatch; 
Adeste 
si 
quid 
mihi 
restat 



agendum. 
And 
the 
like. 
Certainly 
the 
Stoics 
bestowed 
too 
much 
cost 
upon 
death, 
and 
by 
their 
great 
preparations, 
made 
it 
appear 
more 
fearful. 
Better 
saith 
he 
qui 
finem 
vitae 
extremum 
inter 
munera 
ponat 
naturae. 
It 
is 
as 
natural 
to 
die, 
as 
to 
be 
born; 
and 
to 
a 
little 
infant, 
perhaps, 
the 
one 
is 
as 
painful, 
as 
the 
other. 
He 
that 
dies 
in 
an 
earnest 
pursuit, 
is 
like 
one 
that 
is 
wounded 
in 
hot 
blood; 
who, 
for 
the 
time, 
scarce 
feels 
the 
hurt; 
and 
therefore 
a 
mind 
fixed, 
and 
bent 
upon 
somewhat 
that 
is 
good, 
doth 
avert 
the 
dolors 
of 
death. 
But, 
above 
all, 
believe 
it, 
the 
sweetest 
canticle 
is, 
Nunc 
dimittis; 
when 
a 
man 
hath 
obtained 
worthy 
ends, 
and 
expectations. 
Death 
hath 
this 
also; 
that 
it 
openeth 
the 
gate 
to 
good 
fame, 
and 
extinguisheth 
envy. 
— 
Extinctus 
amabitur 
idem. 



OF 
UNITY 
IN 
RELIGION 


Religion 
being 
the 
chief 
band 
of 
human 
society, 
is 
a 
happy 
thing, 
when 
itself 
is 
well 
contained 
within 
the 
true 
band 
of 
unity. 
The 
quarrels, 
and 
divisions 
about 
religion, 
were 
evils 
unknown 
to 
the 
heathen. 
The 
reason 
was, 
because 
the 
religion 
of 
the 
heathen, 
consisted 
rather 
in 
rites 
and 
ceremonies, 
than 
in 
any 
constant 
belief. 
For 
you 
may 
imagine, 
what 
kind 
of 
faith 
theirs 
was, 
when 
the 
chief 
doctors, 
and 
fathers 
of 
their 
church, 
were 
the 
poets. 
But 
the 
true 
God 
hath 
this 
attribute, 
that 
he 
is 
a 
jealous 
God; 
and 
therefore, 
his 
worship 
and 
religion, 
will 
endure 
no 
mixture, 
nor 
partner. 
We 
shall 
therefore 
speak 
a 
few 
words, 
concerning 
the 
unity 
of 
the 
church; 
what 
are 
the 
fruits 
thereof; 
what 
the 
bounds; 
and 
what 
the 
means. 


The 
fruits 
of 
unity 
(next 
unto 
the 
well 
pleasing 
of 
God, 
which 
is 
all 
in 
all) 
are 
two: 
the 
one, 
towards 
those 
that 
are 
without 
the 
church, 
the 
other, 
towards 
those 
that 
are 
within. 
For 
the 
former; 
it 
is 
certain, 
that 
heresies, 
and 
schisms, 
are 
of 
all 
others 
the 
greatest 
scandals; 
yea, 
more 
than 
corruption 
of 
manners. 
For 
as 
in 
the 
natural 
body, 
a 
wound, 
or 
solution 
of 
continuity, 
is 
worse 
than 
a 
corrupt 
humor; 
so 
in 
the 
spiritual. 
So 
that 
nothing, 
doth 
so 
much 
keep 
men 
out 
of 
the 
church 
and 
drive 
men 
out 
of 
the 
church, 
as 
breach 
of 
unity. 
And 
therefore, 
whensoever 
it 
cometh 
to 
that 
pass, 
that 
one 
saith, 
Ecce 
in 
deserto, 
another 
saith, 
Ecce 
in 
penetralibus; 
that 
is, 
when 
some 
men 
seek 
Christ, 
in 
the 
conventicles 
of 
heretics, 
and 
others, 
in 
an 
outward 
face 
of 
a 
church, 
that 
voice 
had 
need 
continually 
to 
sound 
in 
men’s 
ears, 
Nolite 
exire, 


— 
Go 
not 
out. 
The 
doctor 
of 
the 
Gentiles 
(the 
propriety 
of 
whose 
vocation, 
drew 
him 
to 
have 
a 
special 
care 
of 
those 
without) 
saith, 
if 
an 
heathen 
come 
in, 
and 
hear 
you 
speak 
with 
several 
tongues, 
will 
he 
not 
say 
that 
you 
are 
mad? 
And 
certainly 
it 
is 
little 
better, 
when 
atheists, 
and 
profane 
persons, 
do 
hear 
of 
so 
many 
discordant, 
and 
contrary 
opinions 
in 
religion; 
it 
doth 
avert 
them 
from 
the 
church, 
and 
maketh 
them, 
to 
sit 
down 
in 
the 
chair 
of 
the 
scorners. 
It 
is 
but 
a 
light 
thing, 
to 
be 
vouched 
in 
so 
serious 
a 
matter, 
but 
yet 
it 
expresseth 
well 
the 
deformity. 
There 
is 
a 
master 
of 
scoffing, 
that 
in 
his 
catalogue 
of 
books 
of 
a 
feigned 
library, 
sets 
down 
this 
title 
of 
a 
book, 
The 
Morris–Dance 
of 
Heretics. 
For 
indeed, 
every 
sect 
of 
them, 
hath 
a 
diverse 
posture, 
or 
cringe 
by 

themselves, 
which 
cannot 
but 
move 
derision 
in 
worldlings, 
and 
depraved 
politics, 
who 
are 
apt 
to 
contemn 
holy 
things. 


As 
for 
the 
fruit 
towards 
those 
that 
are 
within; 
it 
is 
peace; 
which 
containeth 
infinite 
blessings. 
It 
establisheth 
faith; 
it 
kindleth 
charity; 
the 
outward 
peace 
of 
the 
church, 
distilleth 
into 
peace 
of 
conscience; 
and 
it 
turneth 
the 
labors 
of 
writing, 
and 
reading 
of 
controversies, 
into 
treaties 
of 
mortification 
and 
devotion. 


Concerning 
the 
bounds 
of 
unity; 
the 
true 
placing 
of 
them, 
importeth 
exceedingly. 
There 
appear 
to 
be 
two 
extremes. 
For 
to 
certain 
zealants, 
all 
speech 
of 
pacification 
is 
odious. 
Is 
it 
peace, 
Jehu? 
What 
hast 
thou 
to 
do 
with 
peace? 
turn 
thee 
behind 
me. 
Peace 
is 
not 
the 
matter, 
but 
following, 
and 
party. 
Contrariwise, 
certain 
Laodiceans, 
and 
lukewarm 
persons, 
think 
they 
may 
accommodate 
points 
of 
religion, 
by 
middle 
way, 
and 
taking 
part 
of 
both, 
and 
witty 
reconcilements; 
as 
if 
they 
would 
make 
an 
arbitrament 
between 
God 
and 
man. 
Both 
these 
extremes 
are 
to 
be 
avoided; 
which 
will 
be 
done, 
if 
the 
league 
of 
Christians, 
penned 
by 
our 
Savior 
himself, 
were 
in 
two 
cross 
clauses 
thereof, 
soundly 
and 
plainly 
expounded: 
He 
that 
is 
not 
with 
us, 
is 
against 
us; 
and 
again, 
He 
that 
is 
not 
against 
us, 
is 
with 
us; 
that 
is, 
if 
the 
points 
fundamental 
and 
of 
substance 
in 
religion, 
were 
truly 
discerned 
and 
distinguished, 
from 
points 
not 
merely 
of 
faith, 
but 
of 
opinion, 
order, 
or 
good 
intention. 
This 
is 
a 
thing 
may 
seem 
to 
many 
a 
matter 
trivial, 
and 
done 
already. 
But 
if 
it 
were 
done 
less 
partially, 
it 
would 
be 
embraced 
more 
generally. 


Of 
this 
I 
may 
give 
only 
this 
advice, 
according 
to 
my 
small 
model. 
Men 
ought 
to 
take 
heed, 
of 
rending 
God’s 
church, 
by 
two 
kinds 
of 
controversies. 
The 
one 
is, 
when 
the 
matter 
of 
the 
point 
controverted, 
is 
too 
small 
and 
light, 
not 
worth 
the 
heat 
and 
strife 
about 
it, 
kindled 
only 
by 
contradiction. 
For, 
as 
it 
is 
noted, 
by 
one 
of 
the 
fathers, 
Christ’s 
coat 
indeed 
had 
no 
seam, 
but 
the 
church’s 
vesture 
was 
of 
divers 
colors; 
whereupon 
he 
saith, 
In 
veste 
varietas 
sit, 
scissura 
non 
sit; 
they 
be 
two 
things, 
unity 
and 
uniformity. 
The 
other 
is, 
when 
the 
matter 
of 
the 
point 
controverted, 
is 
great, 
but 
it 
is 
driven 
to 
an 
over-great 
subtilty, 
and 
obscurity; 
so 
that 
it 
becometh 
a 
thing 
rather 
ingenious, 
than 
substantial. 
A 
man 
that 
is 
of 
judgment 
and 
understanding, 
shall 
sometimes 
hear 
ignorant 
men 
differ, 
and 
know 
well 
within 
himself, 
that 
those 
which 
so 
differ, 
mean 
one 
thing, 
and 
yet 
they 
themselves 
would 
never 
agree. 
And 
if 
it 
come 
so 
to 
pass, 
in 
that 
distance 
of 



judgment, 
which 
is 
between 
man 
and 
man, 
shall 
we 
not 
think 
that 
God 
above, 
that 
knows 
the 
heart, 
doth 
not 
discern 
that 
frail 
men, 
in 
some 
of 
their 
contradictions, 
intend 
the 
same 
thing; 
and 
accepteth 
of 
both? 
The 
nature 
of 
such 
controversies 
is 
excellently 
expressed, 
by 
St. 
Paul, 
in 
the 
warning 
and 
precept, 
that 
he 
giveth 
concerning 
the 
same, 
Devita 
profanas 
vocum 
novitates, 
et 
oppositiones 
falsi 
nominis 
scientiae. 
Men 
create 
oppositions, 
which 
are 
not; 
and 
put 
them 
into 
new 
terms, 
so 
fixed, 
as 
whereas 
the 
meaning 
ought 
to 
govern 
the 
term, 
the 
term 
in 
effect 
governeth 
the 
meaning. 
There 
be 
also 
two 
false 
peaces, 
or 
unities: 
the 
one, 
when 
the 
peace 
is 
grounded, 
but 
upon 
an 
implicit 
ignorance; 
for 
all 
colors 
will 
agree 
in 
the 
dark: 
the 
other, 
when 
it 
is 
pieced 
up, 
upon 
a 
direct 
admission 
of 
contraries, 
in 
fundamental 
points. 
For 
truth 
and 
falsehood, 
in 
such 
things, 
are 
like 
the 
iron 
and 
clay, 
in 
the 
toes 
of 
Nebuchadnezzar’s 
image; 
they 
may 
cleave, 
but 
they 
will 
not 
incorporate. 


Concerning 
the 
means 
of 
procuring 
unity; 
men 
must 
beware, 
that 
in 
the 
procuring, 
or 
muniting, 
of 
religious 
unity, 
they 
do 
not 
dissolve 
and 
deface 
the 
laws 
of 
charity, 
and 
of 
human 
society. 
There 
be 
two 
swords 
amongst 
Christians, 
the 
spiritual 
and 
temporal; 
and 
both 
have 
their 
due 
office 
and 
place, 
in 
the 
maintenance 
of 
religion. 
But 
we 
may 
not 
take 
up 
the 
third 
sword, 
which 
is 
Mahomet’s 
sword, 
or 
like 
unto 
it; 
that 
is, 
to 
propagate 
religion 
by 
wars, 
or 
by 
sanguinary 
persecutions 
to 
force 
consciences; 
except 
it 
be 
in 
cases 
of 
overt 
scandal, 
blasphemy, 
or 
intermixture 
of 
practice 
against 
the 
state; 
much 
less 
to 
nourish 
seditions; 
to 
authorize 
conspiracies 
and 
rebellions; 
to 
put 
the 
sword 
into 
the 
people’s 
hands; 
and 
the 
like; 
tending 
to 
the 
subversion 
of 
all 
government, 
which 
is 
the 
ordinance 
of 
God. 
For 
this 
is 
but 
to 
dash 
the 
first 
table 
against 
the 
second; 
and 
so 
to 
consider 
men 
as 
Christians, 
as 
we 
forget 
that 
they 
are 
men. 
Lucretius 
the 
poet, 
when 
he 
beheld 
the 
act 
of 
Agamemnon, 
that 
could 
endure 
the 
sacrificing 
of 
his 
own 
daughter, 
exclaimed: 
Tantum 
Religio 
potuit 
suadere 
malorum. 


What 
would 
he 
have 
said, 
if 
he 
had 
known 
of 
the 
massacre 
in 
France, 
or 
the 
powder 
treason 
of 
England? 
He 
would 
have 
been 
seven 
times 
more 
Epicure, 
and 
atheist, 
than 
he 
was. 
For 
as 
the 
temporal 
sword 
is 
to 
be 
drawn 
with 
great 
circumspection 
in 
cases 
of 
religion; 
so 
it 
is 
a 
thing 
monstrous, 
to 
put 
it 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
common 
people. 
Let 
that 
be 
left 
unto 
the 
Anabaptists, 
and 
other 
furies. 
It 
was 
great 
blasphemy, 
when 
the 
devil 
said, 
I 
will 
ascend, 
and 
be 
like 
the 
highest; 
but 
it 
is 
greater 
blasphemy, 
to 



personate 
God, 
and 
bring 
him 
in 
saying, 
I 
will 
descend, 
and 
be 
like 
the 
prince 
of 
darkness; 
and 
what 
is 
it 
better, 
to 
make 
the 
cause 
of 
religion 
to 
descend, 
to 
the 
cruel 
and 
execrable 
actions 
of 
murthering 
princes, 
butchery 
of 
people, 
and 
subversion 
of 
states 
and 
governments? 
Surely 
this 
is 
to 
bring 
down 
the 
Holy 
Ghost, 
instead 
of 
the 
likeness 
of 
a 
dove, 
in 
the 
shape 
of 
a 
vulture 
or 
raven; 
and 
set, 
out 
of 
the 
bark 
of 
a 
Christian 
church, 
a 
flag 
of 
a 
bark 
of 
pirates, 
and 
assassins. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
most 
necessary, 
that 
the 
church, 
by 
doctrine 
and 
decree, 
princes 
by 
their 
sword, 
and 
all 
learnings, 
both 
Christian 
and 
moral, 
as 
by 
their 
Mercury 
rod, 
do 
damn 
and 
send 
to 
hell 
for 
ever, 
those 
facts 
and 
opinions 
tending 
to 
the 
support 
of 
the 
same; 
as 
hath 
been 
already 
in 
good 
part 
done. 
Surely 
in 
counsels 
concerning 
religion, 
that 
counsel 
of 
the 
apostle 
would 
be 
prefixed, 
Ira 
hominis 
non 
implet 
justitiam 
Dei. 
And 
it 
was 
a 
notable 
observation 
of 
a 
wise 
father, 
and 
no 
less 
ingenuously 
confessed; 
that 
those 
which 
held 
and 
persuaded 
pressure 
of 
consciences, 
were 
commonly 
interested 
therein, 
themselves, 
for 
their 
own 
ends. 



OF 
REVENGE 


Revenge 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
wild 
justice; 
which 
the 
more 
man’s 
nature 
runs 
to, 
the 
more 
ought 
law 
to 
weed 
it 
out. 
For 
as 
for 
the 
first 
wrong, 
it 
doth 
but 
offend 
the 
law; 
but 
the 
revenge 
of 
that 
wrong, 
putteth 
the 
law 
out 
of 
office. 
Certainly, 
in 
taking 
revenge, 
a 
man 
is 
but 
even 
with 
his 
enemy; 
but 
in 
passing 
it 
over, 
he 
is 
superior; 
for 
it 
is 
a 
prince’s 
part 
to 
pardon. 
And 
Solomon, 
I 
am 
sure, 
saith, 
It 
is 
the 
glory 
of 
a 
man, 
to 
pass 
by 
an 
offence. 
That 
which 
is 
past 
is 
gone, 
and 
irrevocable; 
and 
wise 
men 
have 
enough 
to 
do, 
with 
things 
present 
and 
to 
come; 
therefore 
they 
do 
but 
trifle 
with 
themselves, 
that 
labor 
in 
past 
matters. 
There 
is 
no 
man 
doth 
a 
wrong, 
for 
the 
wrong’s 
sake; 
but 
thereby 
to 
purchase 
himself 
profit, 
or 
pleasure, 
or 
honor, 
or 
the 
like. 
Therefore 
why 
should 
I 
be 
angry 
with 
a 
man, 
for 
loving 
himself 
better 
than 
me? 
And 
if 
any 
man 
should 
do 
wrong, 
merely 
out 
of 
ill-nature, 
why, 
yet 
it 
is 
but 
like 
the 
thorn 
or 
briar, 
which 
prick 
and 
scratch, 
because 
they 
can 
do 
no 
other. 
The 
most 
tolerable 
sort 
of 
revenge, 
is 
for 
those 
wrongs 
which 
there 
is 
no 
law 
to 
remedy; 
but 
then 
let 
a 
man 
take 
heed, 
the 
revenge 
be 
such 
as 
there 
is 
no 
law 
to 
punish; 
else 
a 
man’s 
enemy 
is 
still 
before 
hand, 
and 
it 
is 
two 
for 
one. 
Some, 
when 
they 
take 
revenge, 
are 
desirous, 
the 
party 
should 
know, 
whence 
it 
cometh. 
This 
is 
the 
more 
generous. 
For 
the 
delight 
seemeth 
to 
be, 
not 
so 
much 
in 
doing 
the 
hurt, 
as 
in 
making 
the 
party 
repent. 
But 
base 
and 
crafty 
cowards, 
are 
like 
the 
arrow 
that 
flieth 
in 
the 
dark. 
Cosmus, 
duke 
of 
Florence, 
had 
a 
desperate 
saying 
against 
perfidious 
or 
neglecting 
friends, 
as 
if 
those 
wrongs 
were 
unpardonable; 
You 
shall 
read 
(saith 
he) 
that 
we 
are 
commanded 
to 
forgive 
our 
enemies; 
but 
you 
never 
read, 
that 
we 
are 
commanded 
to 
forgive 
our 
friends. 
But 
yet 
the 
spirit 
of 
Job 
was 
in 
a 
better 
tune: 
Shall 
we 
(saith 
he) 
take 
good 
at 
God’s 
hands, 
and 
not 
be 
content 
to 
take 
evil 
also? 
And 
so 
of 
friends 
in 
a 
proportion. 
This 
is 
certain, 
that 
a 
man 
that 
studieth 
revenge, 
keeps 
his 
own 
wounds 
green, 
which 
otherwise 
would 
heal, 
and 
do 
well. 
Public 
revenges 
are 
for 
the 
most 
part 
fortunate; 
as 
that 
for 
the 
death 
of 
Caesar; 
for 
the 
death 
of 
Pertinax; 
for 
the 
death 
of 
Henry 
the 
Third 
of 
France; 
and 
many 
more. 
But 
in 
private 
revenges, 
it 
is 
not 
so. 
Nay 
rather, 
vindictive 
persons 
live 
the 
life 
of 
witches; 
who, 
as 
they 
are 
mischievous, 
so 
end 
they 
infortunate. 



 
OF 
ADVERSITY 


It 
was 
an 
high 
speech 
of 
Seneca 
(after 
the 
manner 
of 
the 
Stoics), 
that 
the 
good 
things, 
which 
belong 
to 
prosperity, 
are 
to 
be 
wished; 
but 
the 
good 
things, 
that 
belong 
to 
adversity, 
are 
to 
be 
admired. 
Bona 
rerum 
secundarum 
optabilia; 
adversarum 
mirabilia. 
Certainly 
if 
miracles 
be 
the 
command 
over 
nature, 
they 
appear 
most 
in 
adversity. 
It 
is 
yet 
a 
higher 
speech 
of 
his, 
than 
the 
other 
(much 
too 
high 
for 
a 
heathen), 
It 
is 
true 
greatness, 
to 
have 
in 
one 
the 
frailty 
of 
a 
man, 
and 
the 
security 
of 
a 
God. 
Vere 
magnum 
habere 
fragilitatem 
hominis, 
securitatem 
Dei. 
This 
would 
have 
done 
better 
in 
poesy, 
where 
transcendences 
are 
more 
allowed. 
And 
the 
poets 
indeed 
have 
been 
busy 
with 
it; 
for 
it 
is 
in 
effect 
the 
thing, 
which 
figured 
in 
that 
strange 
fiction 
of 
the 
ancient 
poets, 
which 
seemeth 
not 
to 
be 
without 
mystery; 
nay, 
and 
to 
have 
some 
approach 
to 
the 
state 
of 
a 
Christian; 
that 
Hercules, 
when 
he 
went 
to 
unbind 
Prometheus 
(by 
whom 
human 
nature 
is 
represented), 
sailed 
the 
length 
of 
the 
great 
ocean, 
in 
an 
earthen 
pot 
or 
pitcher; 
lively 
describing 
Christian 
resolution, 
that 
saileth 
in 
the 
frail 
bark 
of 
the 
flesh, 
through 
the 
waves 
of 
the 
world. 
But 
to 
speak 
in 
a 
mean. 
The 
virtue 
of 
prosperity, 
is 
temperance; 
the 
virtue 
of 
adversity, 
is 
fortitude; 
which 
in 
morals 
is 
the 
more 
heroical 
virtue. 
Prosperity 
is 
the 
blessing 
of 
the 
Old 
Testament; 
adversity 
is 
the 
blessing 
of 
the 
New; 
which 
carrieth 
the 
greater 
benediction, 
and 
the 
clearer 
revelation 
of 
God’s 
favor. 
Yet 
even 
in 
the 
Old 
Testament, 
if 
you 
listen 
to 
David’s 
harp, 
you 
shall 
hear 
as 
many 
hearse-like 
airs 
as 
carols; 
and 
the 
pencil 
of 
the 
Holy 
Ghost 
hath 
labored 
more 
in 
describing 
the 
afflictions 
of 
Job, 
than 
the 
felicities 
of 
Solomon. 
Prosperity 
is 
not 
without 
many 
fears 
and 
distastes; 
and 
adversity 
is 
not 
without 
comforts 
and 
hopes. 
We 
see 
in 
needle-works 
and 
embroideries, 
it 
is 
more 
pleasing 
to 
have 
a 
lively 
work, 
upon 
a 
sad 
and 
solemn 
ground, 
than 
to 
have 
a 
dark 
and 
melancholy 
work, 
upon 
a 
lightsome 
ground: 
judge 
therefore 
of 
the 
pleasure 
of 
the 
heart, 
by 
the 
pleasure 
of 
the 
eye. 
Certainly 
virtue 
is 
like 
precious 
odors, 
most 
fragrant 
when 
they 
are 
incensed, 
or 
crushed: 
for 
prosperity 
doth 
best 
discover 
vice, 
but 
adversity 
doth 
best 
discover 
virtue. 



 
OF 
SIMULATION 
AND 
DISSIMULATION 


Dissimulation 
is 
but 
a 
faint 
kind 
of 
policy, 
or 
wisdom; 
for 
it 
asketh 
a 
strong 
wit, 
and 
a 
strong 
heart, 
to 
know 
when 
to 
tell 
truth, 
and 
to 
do 
it. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
the 
weaker 
sort 
of 
politics, 
that 
are 
the 
great 
dissemblers. 


Tacitus 
saith, 
Livia 
sorted 
well 
with 
the 
arts 
of 
her 
husband, 
and 
dissimulation 
of 
her 
son; 
attributing 
arts 
or 
policy 
to 
Augustus, 
and 
dissimulation 
to 
Tiberius. 
And 
again, 
when 
Mucianus 
encourageth 
Vespasian, 
to 
take 
arms 
against 
Vitellius, 
he 
saith, 
We 
rise 
not 
against 
the 
piercing 
judgment 
of 
Augustus, 
nor 
the 
extreme 
caution 
or 
closeness 
of 
Tiberius. 
These 
properties, 
of 
arts 
or 
policy, 
and 
dissimulation 
or 
closeness, 
are 
indeed 
habits 
and 
faculties 
several, 
and 
to 
be 
distinguished. 
For 
if 
a 
man 
have 
that 
penetration 
of 
judgment, 
as 
he 
can 
discern 
what 
things 
are 
to 
be 
laid 
open, 
and 
what 
to 
be 
secreted, 
and 
what 
to 
be 
showed 
at 
half 
lights, 
and 
to 
whom 
and 
when 
(which 
indeed 
are 
arts 
of 
state, 
and 
arts 
of 
life, 
as 
Tacitus 
well 
calleth 
them), 
to 
him, 
a 
habit 
of 
dissimulation 
is 
a 
hinderance 
and 
a 
poorness. 
But 
if 
a 
man 
cannot 
obtain 
to 
that 
judgment, 
then 
it 
is 
left 
to 
him 
generally, 
to 
be 
close, 
and 
a 
dissembler. 
For 
where 
a 
man 
cannot 
choose, 
or 
vary 
in 
particulars, 
there 
it 
is 
good 
to 
take 
the 
safest, 
and 
wariest 
way, 
in 
general; 
like 
the 
going 
softly, 
by 
one 
that 
cannot 
well 
see. 
Certainly 
the 
ablest 
men 
that 
ever 
were, 
have 
had 
all 
an 
openness, 
and 
frankness, 
of 
dealing; 
and 
a 
name 
of 
certainty 
and 
veracity; 
but 
then 
they 
were 
like 
horses 
well 
managed; 
for 
they 
could 
tell 
passing 
well, 
when 
to 
stop 
or 
turn; 
and 
at 
such 
times, 
when 
they 
thought 
the 
case 
indeed 
required 
dissimulation, 
if 
then 
they 
used 
it, 
it 
came 
to 
pass 
that 
the 
former 
opinion, 
spread 
abroad, 
of 
their 
good 
faith 
and 
clearness 
of 
dealing, 
made 
them 
almost 
invisible. 


There 
be 
three 
degrees 
of 
this 
hiding 
and 
veiling 
of 
a 
man’s 
self. 
The 
first, 
closeness, 
reservation, 
and 
secrecy; 
when 
a 
man 
leaveth 
himself 
without 
observation, 
or 
without 
hold 
to 
be 
taken, 
what 
he 
is. 
The 
second, 
dissimulation, 
in 
the 
negative; 
when 
a 
man 
lets 
fall 
signs 
and 
arguments, 
that 
he 
is 
not, 
that 
he 
is. 
And 
the 
third, 
simulation, 
in 
the 
affirmative; 
when 
a 
man 
industriously 
and 
expressly 
feigns 
and 
pretends 
to 
be, 
that 
he 
is 
not. 


For 
the 
first 
of 
these, 
secrecy; 
it 
is 
indeed 
the 
virtue 
of 
a 
confessor. 



And 
assuredly, 
the 
secret 
man 
heareth 
many 
confessions. 
For 
who 
will 
open 
himself, 
to 
a 
blab 
or 
a 
babbler? 
But 
if 
a 
man 
be 
thought 
secret, 
it 
inviteth 
discovery; 
as 
the 
more 
close 
air 
sucketh 
in 
the 
more 
open; 
and 
as 
in 
confession, 
the 
revealing 
is 
not 
for 
worldly 
use, 
but 
for 
the 
ease 
of 
a 
man’s 
heart, 
so 
secret 
men 
come 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
many 
things 
in 
that 
kind; 
while 
men 
rather 
discharge 
their 
minds, 
than 
impart 
their 
minds. 
In 
few 
words, 
mysteries 
are 
due 
to 
secrecy. 
Besides 
(to 
say 
truth) 
nakedness 
is 
uncomely, 
as 
well 
in 
mind 
as 
body; 
and 
it 
addeth 
no 
small 
reverence, 
to 
men’s 
manners 
and 
actions, 
if 
they 
be 
not 
altogether 
open. 
As 
for 
talkers 
and 
futile 
persons, 
they 
are 
commonly 
vain 
and 
credulous 
withal. 
For 
he 
that 
talketh 
what 
he 
knoweth, 
will 
also 
talk 
what 
he 
knoweth 
not. 
Therefore 
set 
it 
down, 
that 
an 
habit 
of 
secrecy, 
is 
both 
politic 
and 
moral. 
And 
in 
this 
part, 
it 
is 
good 
that 
a 
man’s 
face 
give 
his 
tongue 
leave 
to 
speak. 
For 
the 
discovery 
of 
a 
man’s 
self, 
by 
the 
tracts 
of 
his 
countenance, 
is 
a 
great 
weakness 
and 
betraying; 
by 
how 
much 
it 
is 
many 
times 
more 
marked, 
and 
believed, 
than 
a 
man’s 
words. 


For 
the 
second, 
which 
is 
dissimulation; 
it 
followeth 
many 
times 
upon 
secrecy, 
by 
a 
necessity; 
so 
that 
he 
that 
will 
be 
secret, 
must 
be 
a 
dissembler 
in 
some 
degree. 
For 
men 
are 
too 
cunning, 
to 
suffer 
a 
man 
to 
keep 
an 
indifferent 
carriage 
between 
both, 
and 
to 
be 
secret, 
without 
swaying 
the 
balance 
on 
either 
side. 
They 
will 
so 
beset 
a 
man 
with 
questions, 
and 
draw 
him 
on, 
and 
pick 
it 
out 
of 
him, 
that, 
without 
an 
absurd 
silence, 
he 
must 
show 
an 
inclination 
one 
way; 
or 
if 
he 
do 
not, 
they 
will 
gather 
as 
much 
by 
his 
silence, 
as 
by 
his 
speech. 
As 
for 
equivocations, 
or 
oraculous 
speeches, 
they 
cannot 
hold 
out 
long. 
So 
that 
no 
man 
can 
be 
secret, 
except 
he 
give 
himself 
a 
little 
scope 
of 
dissimulation; 
which 
is, 
as 
it 
were, 
but 
the 
skirts 
or 
train 
of 
secrecy. 


But 
for 
the 
third 
degree, 
which 
is 
simulation, 
and 
false 
profession; 
that 
I 
hold 
more 
culpable, 
and 
less 
politic; 
except 
it 
be 
in 
great 
and 
rare 
matters. 
And 
therefore 
a 
general 
custom 
of 
simulation 
(which 
is 
this 
last 
degree) 
is 
a 
vice, 
rising 
either 
of 
a 
natural 
falseness 
or 
fearfulness, 
or 
of 
a 
mind 
that 
hath 
some 
main 
faults, 
which 
because 
a 
man 
must 
needs 
disguise, 
it 
maketh 
him 
practise 
simulation 
in 
other 
things, 
lest 
his 
hand 
should 
be 
out 
of 
use. 


The 
great 
advantages 
of 
simulation 
and 
dissimulation 
are 
three. 
First, 
to 
lay 
asleep 
opposition, 
and 
to 
surprise. 
For 
where 
a 
man’s 
intentions 
are 
published, 
it 
is 
an 
alarum, 
to 
call 
up 
all 
that 
are 
against 
them. 
The 
second 
is, 



to 
reserve 
to 
a 
man’s 
self 
a 
fair 
retreat. 
For 
if 
a 
man 
engage 
himself 
by 
a 
manifest 
declaration, 
he 
must 
go 
through 
or 
take 
a 
fall. 
The 
third 
is, 
the 
better 
to 
discover 
the 
mind 
of 
another. 
For 
to 
him 
that 
opens 
himself, 
men 
will 
hardly 
show 
themselves 
adverse; 
but 
will 
fair 
let 
him 
go 
on, 
and 
turn 
their 
freedom 
of 
speech, 
to 
freedom 
of 
thought. 
And 
therefore 
it 
is 
a 
good 
shrewd 
proverb 
of 
the 
Spaniard, 
Tell 
a 
lie 
and 
find 
a 
troth. 
As 
if 
there 
were 
no 
way 
of 
discovery, 
but 
by 
simulation. 
There 
be 
also 
three 
disadvantages, 
to 
set 
it 
even. 
The 
first, 
that 
simulation 
and 
dissimulation 
commonly 
carry 
with 
them 
a 
show 
of 
fearfulness, 
which 
in 
any 
business, 
doth 
spoil 
the 
feathers, 
of 
round 
flying 
up 
to 
the 
mark. 
The 
second, 
that 
it 
puzzleth 
and 
perplexeth 
the 
conceits 
of 
many, 
that 
perhaps 
would 
otherwise 
co-operate 
with 
him; 
and 
makes 
a 
man 
walk 
almost 
alone, 
to 
his 
own 
ends. 
The 
third 
and 
greatest 
is, 
that 
it 
depriveth 
a 
man 
of 
one 
of 
the 
most 
principal 
instruments 
for 
action; 
which 
is 
trust 
and 
belief. 
The 
best 
composition 
and 
temperature, 
is 
to 
have 
openness 
in 
fame 
and 
opinion; 
secrecy 
in 
habit; 
dissimulation 
in 
seasonable 
use; 
and 
a 
power 
to 
feign, 
if 
there 
be 
no 
remedy. 



OF 
PARENTS 
AND 
CHILDREN 


The 
joys 
of 
parents 
are 
secret; 
and 
so 
are 
their 
griefs 
and 
fears. 
They 
cannot 
utter 
the 
one; 
nor 
they 
will 
not 
utter 
the 
other. 
Children 
sweeten 
labors; 
but 
they 
make 
misfortunes 
more 
bitter. 
They 
increase 
the 
cares 
of 
life; 
but 
they 
mitigate 
the 
remembrance 
of 
death. 
The 
perpetuity 
by 
generation 
is 
common 
to 
beasts; 
but 
memory, 
merit, 
and 
noble 
works, 
are 
proper 
to 
men. 
And 
surely 
a 
man 
shall 
see 
the 
noblest 
works 
and 
foundations 
have 
proceeded 
from 
childless 
men, 
which 
have 
sought 
to 
express 
the 
images 
of 
their 
minds, 
where 
those 
of 
their 
bodies 
have 
failed. 
So 
the 
care 
of 
posterity 
is 
most 
in 
them, 
that 
have 
no 
posterity. 
They 
that 
are 
the 
first 
raisers 
of 
their 
houses, 
are 
most 
indulgent 
towards 
their 
children; 
beholding 
them 
as 
the 
continuance, 
not 
only 
of 
their 
kind, 
but 
of 
their 
work; 
and 
so 
both 
children 
and 
creatures. 


The 
difference 
in 
affection, 
of 
parents 
towards 
their 
several 
children, 
is 
many 
times 
unequal; 
and 
sometimes 
unworthy; 
especially 
in 
the 
mothers; 
as 
Solomon 
saith, 
A 
wise 
son 
rejoiceth 
the 
father, 
but 
an 
ungracious 
son 
shames 
the 
mother. 
A 
man 
shall 
see, 
where 
there 
is 
a 
house 
full 
of 
children, 
one 
or 
two 
of 
the 
eldest 
respected, 
and 
the 
youngest 
made 
wantons; 
but 
in 
the 
midst, 
some 
that 
are 
as 
it 
were 
forgotten, 
who 
many 
times, 
nevertheless, 
prove 
the 
best. 
The 
illiberality 
of 
parents, 
in 
allowance 
towards 
their 
children, 
is 
an 
harmful 
error; 
makes 
them 
base; 
acquaints 
them 
with 
shifts; 
makes 
them 
sort 
with 
mean 
company; 
and 
makes 
them 
surfeit 
more 
when 
they 
come 
to 
plenty. 
And 
therefore 
the 
proof 
is 
best, 
when 
men 
keep 
their 
authority 
towards 
the 
children, 
but 
not 
their 
purse. 
Men 
have 
a 
foolish 
manner 
(both 
parents 
and 
schoolmasters 
and 
servants) 
in 
creating 
and 
breeding 
an 
emulation 
between 
brothers, 
during 
childhood, 
which 
many 
times 
sorteth 
to 
discord 
when 
they 
are 
men, 
and 
disturbeth 
families. 
The 
Italians 
make 
little 
difference 
between 
children, 
and 
nephews 
or 
near 
kinsfolks; 
but 
so 
they 
be 
of 
the 
lump, 
they 
care 
not 
though 
they 
pass 
not 
through 
their 
own 
body. 
And, 
to 
say 
truth, 
in 
nature 
it 
is 
much 
a 
like 
matter; 
insomuch 
that 
we 
see 
a 
nephew 
sometimes 
resembleth 
an 
uncle, 
or 
a 
kinsman, 
more 
than 
his 
own 
parent; 
as 
the 
blood 
happens. 
Let 
parents 
choose 
betimes, 
the 
vocations 
and 
courses 



they 
mean 
their 
children 
should 
take; 
for 
then 
they 
are 
most 
flexible; 
and 
let 
them 
not 
too 
much 
apply 
themselves 
to 
the 
disposition 
of 
their 
children, 
as 
thinking 
they 
will 
take 
best 
to 
that, 
which 
they 
have 
most 
mind 
to. 
It 
is 
true, 
that 
if 
the 
affection 
or 
aptness 
of 
the 
children 
be 
extraordinary, 
then 
it 
is 
good 
not 
to 
cross 
it; 
but 
generally 
the 
precept 
is 
good, 
optimum 
elige, 
suave 
et 
facile 
illud 
faciet 
consuetudo. 
Younger 
brothers 
are 
commonly 
fortunate, 
but 
seldom 
or 
never 
where 
the 
elder 
are 
disinherited. 



OF 
MARRIAGE 
AND 
SINGLE 
LIFE 


He 
that 
hath 
wife 
and 
children 
hath 
given 
hostages 
to 
fortune; 
for 
they 
are 
impediments 
to 
great 
enterprises, 
either 
of 
virtue 
or 
mischief. 
Certainly 
the 
best 
works, 
and 
of 
greatest 
merit 
for 
the 
public, 
have 
proceeded 
from 
the 
unmarried 
or 
childless 
men; 
which 
both 
in 
affection 
and 
means, 
have 
married 
and 
endowed 
the 
public. 
Yet 
it 
were 
great 
reason 
that 
those 
that 
have 
children, 
should 
have 
greatest 
care 
of 
future 
times; 
unto 
which 
they 
know 
they 
must 
transmit 
their 
dearest 
pledges. 
Some 
there 
are, 
who 
though 
they 
lead 
a 
single 
life, 
yet 
their 
thoughts 
do 
end 
with 
themselves, 
and 
account 
future 
times 
impertinences. 
Nay, 
there 
are 
some 
other, 
that 
account 
wife 
and 
children, 
but 
as 
bills 
of 
charges. 
Nay 
more, 
there 
are 
some 
foolish 
rich 
covetous 
men 
that 
take 
a 
pride, 
in 
having 
no 
children, 
because 
they 
may 
be 
thought 
so 
much 
the 
richer. 
For 
perhaps 
they 
have 
heard 
some 
talk, 
Such 
an 
one 
is 
a 
great 
rich 
man, 
and 
another 
except 
to 
it, 
Yea, 
but 
he 
hath 
a 
great 
charge 
of 
children; 
as 
if 
it 
were 
an 
abatement 
to 
his 
riches. 
But 
the 
most 
ordinary 
cause 
of 
a 
single 
life, 
is 
liberty, 
especially 
in 
certain 
self-pleasing 
and 
humorous 
minds, 
which 
are 
so 
sensible 
of 
every 
restraint, 
as 
they 
will 
go 
near 
to 
think 
their 
girdles 
and 
garters, 
to 
be 
bonds 
and 
shackles. 
Unmarried 
men 
are 
best 
friends, 
best 
masters, 
best 
servants; 
but 
not 
always 
best 
subjects; 
for 
they 
are 
light 
to 
run 
away; 
and 
almost 
all 
fugitives, 
are 
of 
that 
condition. 
A 
single 
life 
doth 
well 
with 
churchmen; 
for 
charity 
will 
hardly 
water 
the 
ground, 
where 
it 
must 
first 
fill 
a 
pool. 
It 
is 
indifferent 
for 
judges 
and 
magistrates; 
for 
if 
they 
be 
facile 
and 
corrupt, 
you 
shall 
have 
a 
servant, 
five 
times 
worse 
than 
a 
wife. 
For 
soldiers, 
I 
find 
the 
generals 
commonly 
in 
their 
hortatives, 
put 
men 
in 
mind 
of 
their 
wives 
and 
children; 
and 
I 
think 
the 
despising 
of 
marriage 
amongst 
the 
Turks, 
maketh 
the 
vulgar 
soldier 
more 
base. 
Certainly 
wife 
and 
children 
are 
a 
kind 
of 
discipline 
of 
humanity; 
and 
single 
men, 
though 
they 
may 
be 
many 
times 
more 
charitable, 
because 
their 
means 
are 
less 
exhaust, 
yet, 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
they 
are 
more 
cruel 
and 
hardhearted 
(good 
to 
make 
severe 
inquisitors), 
because 
their 
tenderness 
is 
not 
so 
oft 
called 
upon. 
Grave 
natures, 
led 
by 
custom, 
and 
therefore 
constant, 
are 
commonly 
loving 
husbands, 
as 
was 
said 
of 
Ulysses, 
vetulam 
suam 
praetulit 
immortalitati. 
Chaste 
women 
are 
often 
proud 
and 
froward, 
as 
presuming 
upon 



the 
merit 
of 
their 
chastity. 
It 
is 
one 
of 
the 
best 
bonds, 
both 
of 
chastity 
and 
obedience, 
in 
the 
wife, 
if 
she 
think 
her 
husband 
wise; 
which 
she 
will 
never 
do, 
if 
she 
find 
him 
jealous. 
Wives 
are 
young 
men’s 
mistresses; 
companions 
for 
middle 
age; 
and 
old 
men’s 
nurses. 
So 
as 
a 
man 
may 
have 
a 
quarrel 
to 
marry, 
when 
he 
will. 
But 
yet 
he 
was 
reputed 
one 
of 
the 
wise 
men, 
that 
made 
answer 
to 
the 
question, 
when 
a 
man 
should 
marry,– 
A 
young 
man 
not 
yet, 
an 
elder 
man 
not 
at 
all. 
It 
is 
often 
seen 
that 
bad 
husbands, 
have 
very 
good 
wives; 
whether 
it 
be, 
that 
it 
raiseth 
the 
price 
of 
their 
husband’s 
kindness, 
when 
it 
comes; 
or 
that 
the 
wives 
take 
a 
pride 
in 
their 
patience. 
But 
this 
never 
fails, 
if 
the 
bad 
husbands 
were 
of 
their 
own 
choosing, 
against 
their 
friends’ 
consent; 
for 
then 
they 
will 
be 
sure 
to 
make 
good 
their 
own 
folly. 



OF 
ENVY 


There 
be 
none 
of 
the 
affections, 
which 
have 
been 
noted 
to 
fascinate 
or 
bewitch, 
but 
love 
and 
envy. 
They 
both 
have 
vehement 
wishes; 
they 
frame 
themselves 
readily 
into 
imaginations 
and 
suggestions; 
and 
they 
come 
easily 
into 
the 
eye, 
especially 
upon 
the 
present 
of 
the 
objects; 
which 
are 
the 
points 
that 
conduce 
to 
fascination, 
if 
any 
such 
thing 
there 
be. 
see 
likewise, 
the 
Scripture 
calleth 
envy 
an 
evil 
eye; 
and 
the 
astrologers, 
call 
the 
evil 
influences 
of 
the 
stars, 
evil 
aspects; 
so 
that 
still 
there 
seemeth 
to 
be 
acknowledged, 
in 
the 
act 
of 
envy, 
an 
ejaculation 
or 
irradiation 
of 
the 
eye. 
Nay, 
some 
have 
been 
so 
curious, 
as 
to 
note, 
that 
the 
times 
when 
the 
stroke 
or 
percussion 
of 
an 
envious 
eye 
doth 
most 
hurt, 
are 
when 
the 
party 
envied 
is 
beheld 
in 
glory 
or 
triumph; 
for 
that 
sets 
an 
edge 
upon 
envy: 
and 
besides, 
at 
such 
times 
the 
spirits 
of 
the 
person 
envied, 
do 
come 
forth 
most 
into 
the 
outward 
parts, 
and 
so 
meet 
the 
blow. 


But 
leaving 
these 
curiosities 
(though 
not 
unworthy 
to 
be 
thought 
on, 
in 
fit 
place), 
we 
will 
handle, 
what 
persons 
are 
apt 
to 
envy 
others; 
what 
persons 
are 
most 
subject 
to 
be 
envied 
themselves; 
and 
what 
is 
the 
difference 
between 
public 
and 
private 
envy. 


A 
man 
that 
hath 
no 
virtue 
in 
himself, 
ever 
envieth 
virtue 
in 
others. 
For 
men’s 
minds, 
will 
either 
feed 
upon 
their 
own 
good, 
or 
upon 
others’ 
evil; 
and 
who 
wanteth 
the 
one, 
will 
prey 
upon 
the 
other; 
and 
whoso 
is 
out 
of 
hope, 
to 
attain 
to 
another’s 
virtue, 
will 
seek 
to 
come 
at 
even 
hand, 
by 
depressing 
another’s 
fortune. 


A 
man 
that 
is 
busy, 
and 
inquisitive, 
is 
commonly 
envious. 
For 
to 
know 
much 
of 
other 
men’s 
matters, 
cannot 
be 
because 
all 
that 
ado 
may 
concern 
his 
own 
estate; 
therefore 
it 
must 
needs 
be, 
that 
he 
taketh 
a 
kind 
of 
play-pleasure, 
in 
looking 
upon 
the 
fortunes 
of 
others. 
Neither 
can 
he, 
that 
mindeth 
but 
his 
own 
business, 
find 
much 
matter 
for 
envy. 
For 
envy 
is 
a 
gadding 
passion, 
and 
walketh 
the 
streets, 
and 
doth 
not 
keep 
home: 
Non 
est 
curiosus, 
quin 
idem 
sit 
malevolus. 


Men 
of 
noble 
birth, 
are 
noted 
to 
be 
envious 
towards 
new 
men, 
when 



they 
rise. 
For 
the 
distance 
is 
altered, 
and 
it 
is 
like 
a 
deceit 
of 
the 
eye, 
that 
when 
others 
come 
on, 
they 
think 
themselves, 
go 
back. 


Deformed 
persons, 
and 
eunuchs, 
and 
old 
men, 
and 
bastards, 
are 
envious. 
For 
he 
that 
cannot 
possibly 
mend 
his 
own 
case, 
will 
do 
what 
he 
can, 
to 
impair 
another’s; 
except 
these 
defects 
light 
upon 
a 
very 
brave, 
and 
heroical 
nature, 
which 
thinketh 
to 
make 
his 
natural 
wants 
part 
of 
his 
honor; 
in 
that 
it 
should 
be 
said, 
that 
an 
eunuch, 
or 
a 
lame 
man, 
did 
such 
great 
matters; 
affecting 
the 
honor 
of 
a 
miracle; 
as 
it 
was 
in 
Narses 
the 
eunuch, 
and 
Agesilaus 
and 
Tamberlanes, 
that 
were 
lame 
men. 


The 
same 
is 
the 
case 
of 
men, 
that 
rise 
after 
calamities 
and 
misfortunes. 
For 
they 
are 
as 
men 
fallen 
out 
with 
the 
times; 
and 
think 
other 
men’s 
harms, 
a 
redemption 
of 
their 
own 
sufferings. 


They 
that 
desire 
to 
excel 
in 
too 
many 
matters, 
out 
of 
levity 
and 
vain 
glory, 
are 
ever 
envious. 
For 
they 
cannot 
want 
work; 
it 
being 
impossible, 
but 
many, 
in 
some 
one 
of 
those 
things, 
should 
surpass 
them. 
Which 
was 
the 
character 
of 
Adrian 
the 
Emperor; 
that 
mortally 
envied 
poets, 
and 
painters, 
and 
artificers, 
in 
works 
wherein 
he 
had 
a 
vein 
to 
excel. 


Lastly, 
near 
kinsfolks, 
and 
fellows 
in 
office, 
and 
those 
that 
have 
been 
bred 
together, 
are 
more 
apt 
to 
envy 
their 
equals, 
when 
they 
are 
raised. 
For 
it 
doth 
upbraid 
unto 
them 
their 
own 
fortunes, 
and 
pointeth 
at 
them, 
and 
cometh 
oftener 
into 
their 
remembrance, 
and 
incurreth 
likewise 
more 
into 
the 
note 
of 
others; 
and 
envy 
ever 
redoubleth 
from 
speech 
and 
fame. 
Cain’s 
envy 
was 
the 
more 
vile 
and 
malignant, 
towards 
his 
brother 
Abel, 
because 
when 
his 
sacrifice 
was 
better 
accepted, 
there 
was 
no 
body 
to 
look 
on. 
Thus 
much 
for 
those, 
that 
are 
apt 
to 
envy. 


Concerning 
those 
that 
are 
more 
or 
less 
subject 
to 
envy: 
First, 
persons 
of 
eminent 
virtue, 
when 
they 
are 
advanced, 
are 
less 
envied. 
For 
their 
fortune 
seemeth, 
but 
due 
unto 
them; 
and 
no 
man 
envieth 
the 
payment 
of 
a 
debt, 
but 
rewards 
and 
liberality 
rather. 
Again, 
envy 
is 
ever 
joined 
with 
the 
comparing 
of 
a 
man’s 
self; 
and 
where 
there 
is 
no 
comparison, 
no 
envy; 
and 
therefore 
kings 
are 
not 
envied, 
but 
by 
kings. 
Nevertheless 
it 
is 
to 
be 
noted, 
that 
unworthy 
persons 
are 
most 
envied, 
at 
their 
first 
coming 
in, 
and 
afterwards 
overcome 
it 
better; 
whereas 
contrariwise, 
persons 
of 
worth 
and 
merit 
are 
most 
envied, 
when 
their 
fortune 
continueth 
long. 
For 
by 
that 
time, 
though 
their 
virtue 
be 
the 
same, 
yet 
it 
hath 
not 
the 
same 
lustre; 
for 
fresh 
men 
grow 
up 
that 



darken 
it. 


Persons 
of 
noble 
blood, 
are 
less 
envied 
in 
their 
rising. 
For 
it 
seemeth 
but 
right 
done 
to 
their 
birth. 
Besides, 
there 
seemeth 
not 
much 
added 
to 
their 
fortune; 
and 
envy 
is 
as 
the 
sunbeams, 
that 
beat 
hotter 
upon 
a 
bank, 
or 
steep 
rising 
ground, 
than 
upon 
a 
flat. 
And 
for 
the 
same 
reason, 
those 
that 
are 
advanced 
by 
degrees, 
are 
less 
envied 
than 
those 
that 
are 
advanced 
suddenly 
and 
per 
saltum. 


Those 
that 
have 
joined 
with 
their 
honor 
great 
travels, 
cares, 
or 
perils, 
are 
less 
subject 
to 
envy. 
For 
men 
think 
that 
they 
earn 
their 
honors 
hardly, 
and 
pity 
them 
sometimes; 
and 
pity 
ever 
healeth 
envy. 
Wherefore 
you 
shall 
observe, 
that 
the 
more 
deep 
and 
sober 
sort 
of 
politic 
persons, 
in 
their 
greatness, 
are 
ever 
bemoaning 
themselves, 
what 
a 
life 
they 
lead; 
chanting 
a 
quanta 
patimur! 
Not 
that 
they 
feel 
it 
so, 
but 
only 
to 
abate 
the 
edge 
of 
envy. 
But 
this 
is 
to 
be 
understood, 
of 
business 
that 
is 
laid 
upon 
men, 
and 
not 
such, 
as 
they 
call 
unto 
themselves. 
For 
nothing 
increaseth 
envy 
more, 
than 
an 
unnecessary 
and 
ambitious 
engrossing 
of 
business. 
And 
nothing 
doth 
extinguish 
envy 
than 
for 
a 
great 
person 
to 
preserve 
all 
other 
inferior 
officers, 
in 
their 
full 
rights 
and 
pre-eminences 
of 
their 
places. 
For 
by 
that 
means, 
there 
be 
so 
many 
screens 
between 
him 
and 
envy. 


Above 
all, 
those 
are 
most 
subject 
to 
envy, 
which 
carry 
the 
greatness 
of 
their 
fortunes, 
in 
an 
insolent 
and 
proud 
manner; 
being 
never 
well, 
but 
while 
they 
are 
showing 
how 
great 
they 
are, 
either 
by 
outward 
pomp, 
or 
by 
triumphing 
over 
all 
opposition 
or 
competition; 
whereas 
wise 
men 
will 
rather 
do 
sacrifice 
to 
envy, 
in 
suffering 
themselves 
sometimes 
of 
purpose 
to 
be 
crossed, 
and 
overborne 
in 
things 
that 
do 
not 
much 
concern 
them. 
Notwithstanding, 
so 
much 
is 
true, 
that 
the 
carriage 
of 
greatness, 
in 
a 
plain 
and 
open 
manner 
(so 
it 
be 
without 
arrogancy 
and 
vain 
glory) 
doth 
draw 
less 
envy, 
than 
if 
it 
be 
in 
a 
more 
crafty 
and 
cunning 
fashion. 
For 
in 
that 
course, 
a 
man 
doth 
but 
disavow 
fortune; 
and 
seemeth 
to 
be 
conscious 
of 
his 
own 
want 
in 
worth; 
and 
doth 
but 
teach 
others, 
to 
envy 
him. 


Lastly, 
to 
conclude 
this 
part; 
as 
we 
said 
in 
the 
beginning, 
that 
the 
act 
of 
envy 
had 
somewhat 
in 
it 
of 
witchcraft, 
so 
there 
is 
no 
other 
cure 
of 
envy, 
but 
the 
cure 
of 
witchcraft; 
and 
that 
is 
to 
remove 
the 
lot 
(as 
they 
call 
it) 
and 
to 
lay 
it 
upon 
another. 
For 
which 
purpose, 
the 
wiser 
sort 
of 
great 
persons, 
bring 
in 
ever 
upon 
the 
stage 
somebody 
upon 
whom 
to 
derive 
the 
envy, 
that 
would 



come 
upon 
themselves; 
sometimes 
upon 
ministers 
and 
servants; 
sometimes 
upon 
colleagues 
and 
associates; 
and 
the 
like; 
and 
for 
that 
turn 
there 
are 
never 
wanting, 
some 
persons 
of 
violent 
and 
undertaking 
natures, 
who, 
so 
they 
may 
have 
power 
and 
business, 
will 
take 
it 
at 
any 
cost. 


Now, 
to 
speak 
of 
public 
envy. 
There 
is 
yet 
some 
good 
in 
public 
envy, 
whereas 
in 
private, 
there 
is 
none. 
For 
public 
envy, 
is 
as 
an 
ostracism, 
that 
eclipseth 
men, 
when 
they 
grow 
too 
great. 
And 
therefore 
it 
is 
a 
bridle 
also 
to 
great 
ones, 
to 
keep 
them 
within 
bounds. 


This 
envy, 
being 
in 
the 
Latin 
word 
invidia, 
goeth 
in 
the 
modern 
language, 
by 
the 
name 
of 
discontentment; 
of 
which 
we 
shall 
speak, 
in 
handling 
sedition. 
It 
is 
a 
disease, 
in 
a 
state, 
like 
to 
infection. 
For 
as 
infection 
spreadeth 
upon 
that 
which 
is 
sound, 
and 
tainteth 
it; 
so 
when 
envy 
is 
gotten 
once 
into 
a 
state, 
it 
traduceth 
even 
the 
best 
actions 
thereof, 
and 
turneth 
them 
into 
an 
ill 
odor. 
And 
therefore 
there 
is 
little 
won, 
by 
intermingling 
of 
plausible 
actions. 
For 
that 
doth 
argue 
but 
a 
weakness, 
and 
fear 
of 
envy, 
which 
hurteth 
so 
much 
the 
more, 
as 
it 
is 
likewise 
usual 
in 
infections; 
which 
if 
you 
fear 
them, 
you 
call 
them 
upon 
you. 


This 
public 
envy, 
seemeth 
to 
beat 
chiefly 
upon 
principal 
officers 
or 
ministers, 
rather 
than 
upon 
kings, 
and 
estates 
themselves. 
But 
this 
is 
a 
sure 
rule, 
that 
if 
the 
envy 
upon 
the 
minister 
be 
great, 
when 
the 
cause 
of 
it 
in 
him 
is 
small; 
or 
if 
the 
envy 
be 
general, 
in 
a 
manner 
upon 
all 
the 
ministers 
of 
an 
estate; 
then 
the 
envy 
(though 
hidden) 
is 
truly 
upon 
the 
state 
itself. 
And 
so 
much 
of 
public 
envy 
or 
discontentment, 
and 
the 
difference 
thereof 
from 
private 
envy, 
which 
was 
handled 
in 
the 
first 
place. 


We 
will 
add 
this 
in 
general, 
touching 
the 
affection 
of 
envy; 
that 
of 
all 
other 
affections, 
it 
is 
the 
most 
importune 
and 
continual. 
For 
of 
other 
affections, 
there 
is 
occasion 
given, 
but 
now 
and 
then; 
and 
therefore 
it 
was 
well 
said, 
Invidia 
festos 
dies 
non 
agit: 
for 
it 
is 
ever 
working 
upon 
some 
or 
other. 
And 
it 
is 
also 
noted, 
that 
love 
and 
envy 
do 
make 
a 
man 
pine, 
which 
other 
affections 
do 
not, 
because 
they 
are 
not 
so 
continual. 
It 
is 
also 
the 
vilest 
affection, 
and 
the 
most 
depraved; 
for 
which 
cause 
it 
is 
the 
proper 
attribute 
of 
the 
devil, 
who 
is 
called, 
the 
envious 
man, 
that 
soweth 
tares 
amongst 
the 
wheat 
by 
night; 
as 
it 
always 
cometh 
to 
pass, 
that 
envy 
worketh 
subtilly, 
and 
in 
the 
dark, 
and 
to 
the 
prejudice 
of 
good 
things, 
such 
as 
is 
the 
wheat. 



 
OF 
LOVE 


The 
stage 
is 
more 
beholding 
to 
love, 
that 
the 
life 
of 
man. 
For 
as 
to 
the 
stage, 
love 
is 
ever 
matter 
of 
comedies, 
and 
now 
and 
then 
of 
tragedies; 
but 
in 
life 
it 
doth 
much 
mischief; 
sometimes 
like 
a 
siren, 
sometimes 
like 
a 
fury. 
You 
may 
observe, 
that 
amongst 
all 
the 
great 
and 
worthy 
persons 
(whereof 
the 
memory 
remaineth, 
either 
ancient 
or 
recent) 
there 
is 
not 
one, 
that 
hath 
been 
transported 
to 
the 
mad 
degree 
of 
love: 
which 
shows 
that 
great 
spirits, 
and 
great 
business, 
do 
keep 
out 
this 
weak 
passion. 
You 
must 
except, 
nevertheless, 
Marcus 
Antonius, 
the 
half 
partner 
of 
the 
empire 
of 
Rome, 
and 
Appius 
Claudius, 
the 
decemvir 
and 
lawgiver; 
whereof 
the 
former 
was 
indeed 
a 
voluptuous 
man, 
and 
inordinate; 
but 
the 
latter 
was 
an 
austere 
and 
wise 
man: 
and 
therefore 
it 
seems 
(though 
rarely) 
that 
love 
can 
find 
entrance, 
not 
only 
into 
an 
open 
heart, 
but 
also 
into 
a 
heart 
well 
fortified, 
if 
watch 
be 
not 
well 
kept. 
It 
is 
a 
poor 
saying 
of 
Epicurus, 
Satis 
magnum 
alter 
alteri 
theatrum 
sumus; 
as 
if 
man, 
made 
for 
the 
contemplation 
of 
heaven, 
and 
all 
noble 
objects, 
should 
do 
nothing 
but 
kneel 
before 
a 
little 
idol 
and 
make 
himself 
a 
subject, 
though 
not 
of 
the 
mouth 
(as 
beasts 
are), 
yet 
of 
the 
eye; 
which 
was 
given 
him 
for 
higher 
purposes. 
It 
is 
a 
strange 
thing, 
to 
note 
the 
excess 
of 
this 
passion, 
and 
how 
it 
braves 
the 
nature, 
and 
value 
of 
things, 
by 
this; 
that 
the 
speaking 
in 
a 
perpetual 
hyperbole, 
is 
comely 
in 
nothing 
but 
in 
love. 
Neither 
is 
it 
merely 
in 
the 
phrase; 
for 
whereas 
it 
hath 
been 
well 
said, 
that 
the 
arch-
flatterer, 
with 
whom 
all 
the 
petty 
flatterers 
have 
intelligence, 
is 
a 
man’s 
self; 
certainly 
the 
lover 
is 
more. 
For 
there 
was 
never 
proud 
man 
thought 
so 
absurdly 
well 
of 
himself, 
as 
the 
lover 
doth 
of 
the 
person 
loved; 
and 
therefore 
it 
was 
well 
said, 
That 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
love, 
and 
to 
be 
wise. 
Neither 
doth 
this 
weakness 
appear 
to 
others 
only, 
and 
not 
to 
the 
party 
loved; 
but 
to 
the 
loved 
most 
of 
all, 
except 
the 
love 
be 
reciproque. 
For 
it 
is 
a 
true 
rule, 
that 
love 
is 
ever 
rewarded, 
either 
with 
the 
reciproque, 
or 
with 
an 
inward 
and 
secret 
contempt. 
By 
how 
much 
the 
more, 
men 
ought 
to 
beware 
of 
this 
passion, 
which 
loseth 
not 
only 
other 
things, 
but 
itself! 
As 
for 
the 
other 
losses, 
the 
poet’s 
relation 
doth 
well 
figure 
them: 
that 
he 
that 
preferred 
Helena, 
quitted 
the 
gifts 
of 
Juno 
and 
Pallas. 
For 
whosoever 
esteemeth 
too 
much 
of 
amorous 
affection, 
quitteth 
both 
riches 
and 
wisdom. 
This 
passion 
hath 
his 
floods, 
in 



very 
times 
of 
weakness; 
which 
are 
great 
prosperity, 
and 
great 
adversity; 
though 
this 
latter 
hath 
been 
less 
observed: 
both 
which 
times 
kindle 
love, 
and 
make 
it 
more 
fervent, 
and 
therefore 
show 
it 
to 
be 
the 
child 
of 
folly. 
They 
do 
best, 
who 
if 
they 
cannot 
but 
admit 
love, 
yet 
make 
it 
keep 
quarters; 
and 
sever 
it 
wholly 
from 
their 
serious 
affairs, 
and 
actions, 
of 
life; 
for 
if 
it 
check 
once 
with 
business, 
it 
troubleth 
men’s 
fortunes, 
and 
maketh 
men, 
that 
they 
can 
no 
ways 
be 
true 
to 
their 
own 
ends. 
I 
know 
not 
how, 
but 
martial 
men 
are 
given 
to 
love: 
I 
think, 
it 
is 
but 
as 
they 
are 
given 
to 
wine; 
for 
perils 
commonly 
ask 
to 
be 
paid 
in 
pleasures. 
There 
is 
in 
man’s 
nature, 
a 
secret 
inclination 
and 
motion, 
towards 
love 
of 
others, 
which 
if 
it 
be 
not 
spent 
upon 
some 
one 
or 
a 
few, 
doth 
naturally 
spread 
itself 
towards 
many, 
and 
maketh 
men 
become 
humane 
and 
charitable; 
as 
it 
is 
seen 
sometime 
in 
friars. 
Nuptial 
love 
maketh 
mankind; 
friendly 
love 
perfecteth 
it; 
but 
wanton 
love 
corrupteth, 
and 
embaseth 
it. 



OF 
GREAT 
PLACE 


Men 
in 
great 
place 
are 
thrice 
servants: 
servants 
of 
the 
sovereign 
or 
state; 
servants 
of 
fame; 
and 
servants 
of 
business. 
So 
as 
they 
have 
no 
freedom; 
neither 
in 
their 
persons, 
nor 
in 
their 
actions, 
nor 
in 
their 
times. 
It 
is 
a 
strange 
desire, 
to 
seek 
power 
and 
to 
lose 
liberty: 
or 
to 
seek 
power 
over 
others, 
and 
to 
lose 
power 
over 
a 
man’s 
self. 
The 
rising 
unto 
place 
is 
laborious; 
and 
by 
pains, 
men 
come 
to 
greater 
pains; 
and 
it 
is 
sometimes 
base; 
and 
by 
indignities, 
men 
come 
to 
dignities. 
The 
standing 
is 
slippery, 
and 
the 
regress 
is 
either 
a 
downfall, 
or 
at 
least 
an 
eclipse, 
which 
is 
a 
melancholy 
thing. 
Cum 
non 
sis 
qui 
fueris, 
non 
esse 
cur 
velis 
vivere. 
Nay, 
retire 
men 
cannot 
when 
they 
would, 
neither 
will 
they, 
when 
it 
were 
reason; 
but 
are 
impatient 
of 
privateness, 
even 
in 
age 
and 
sickness, 
which 
require 
the 
shadow; 
like 
old 
townsmen, 
that 
will 
be 
still 
sitting 
at 
their 
street 
door, 
though 
thereby 
they 
offer 
age 
to 
scorn. 
Certainly 
great 
persons 
had 
need 
to 
borrow 
other 
men’s 
opinions, 
to 
think 
themselves 
happy; 
for 
if 
they 
judge 
by 
their 
own 
feeling, 
they 
cannot 
find 
it; 
but 
if 
they 
think 
with 
themselves, 
what 
other 
men 
think 
of 
them, 
and 
that 
other 
men 
would 
fain 
be, 
as 
they 
are, 
then 
they 
are 
happy, 
as 
it 
were, 
by 
report; 
when 
perhaps 
they 
find 
the 
contrary 
within. 
For 
they 
are 
the 
first, 
that 
find 
their 
own 
griefs, 
though 
they 
be 
the 
last, 
that 
find 
their 
own 
faults. 
Certainly 
men 
in 
great 
fortunes 
are 
strangers 
to 
themselves, 
and 
while 
they 
are 
in 
the 
puzzle 
of 
business, 
they 
have 
no 
time 
to 
tend 
their 
health, 
either 
of 
body 
or 
mind. 
Illi 
mors 
gravis 
incubat, 
qui 
notus 
nimis 
omnibus, 
ignotus 
moritur 
sibi. 
In 
place, 
there 
is 
license 
to 
do 
good, 
and 
evil; 
whereof 
the 
latter 
is 
a 
curse: 
for 
in 
evil 
the 
best 
condition 
is 
not 
to 
will; 
the 
second, 
not 
to 
can. 
But 
power 
to 
do 
good, 
is 
the 
true 
and 
lawful 
end 
of 
aspiring. 
For 
good 
thoughts 
(though 
God 
accept 
them) 
yet, 
towards 
men, 
are 
little 
better 
than 
good 
dreams, 
except 
they 
be 
put 
in 
act; 
and 
that 
cannot 
be, 
without 
power 
and 
place, 
as 
the 
vantage, 
and 
commanding 
ground. 
Merit 
and 
good 
works, 
is 
the 
end 
of 
man’s 
motion; 
and 
conscience 
of 
the 
same 
is 
the 
accomplishment 
of 
man’s 
rest. 
For 
if 
a 
man 
can 
be 
partaker 
of 
God’s 
theatre, 
he 
shall 
likewise 
be 
partaker 
of 
God’s 
rest. 
Et 
conversus 
Deus, 
ut 
aspiceret 
opera 
quae 
fecerunt 
manus 
suae, 
vidit 
quod 
omnia 
essent 
bona 
nimis; 
and 
then 
the 
sabbath. 
In 
the 
discharge 
of 
thy 
place, 
set 
before 
thee 
the 
best 
examples; 
for 
imitation 
is 
a 
globe 
of 
precepts. 
And 
after 
a 
time, 
set 
before 
thee 
thine 
own 
example; 
and 



examine 
thyself 
strictly, 
whether 
thou 
didst 
not 
best 
at 
first. 
Neglect 
not 
also 
the 
examples, 
of 
those 
that 
have 
carried 
themselves 
ill, 
in 
the 
same 
place; 
not 
to 
set 
off 
thyself, 
by 
taxing 
their 
memory, 
but 
to 
direct 
thyself, 
what 
to 
avoid. 
Reform 
therefore, 
without 
bravery, 
or 
scandal 
of 
former 
times 
and 
persons; 
but 
yet 
set 
it 
down 
to 
thyself, 
as 
well 
to 
create 
good 
precedents, 
as 
to 
follow 
them. 
Reduce 
things 
to 
the 
first 
institution, 
and 
observe 
wherein, 
and 
how, 
they 
have 
degenerate; 
but 
yet 
ask 
counsel 
of 
both 
times; 
of 
the 
ancient 
time, 
what 
is 
best; 
and 
of 
the 
latter 
time, 
what 
is 
fittest. 
Seek 
to 
make 
thy 
course 
regular, 
that 
men 
may 
know 
beforehand, 
what 
they 
may 
expect; 
but 
be 
not 
too 
positive 
and 
peremptory; 
and 
express 
thyself 
well, 
when 
thou 
digressest 
from 
thy 
rule. 
Preserve 
the 
right 
of 
thy 
place; 
but 
stir 
not 
questions 
of 
jurisdiction; 
and 
rather 
assume 
thy 
right, 
in 
silence 
and 
de 
facto, 
than 
voice 
it 
with 
claims, 
and 
challenges. 
Preserve 
likewise 
the 
rights 
of 
inferior 
places; 
and 
think 
it 
more 
honor, 
to 
direct 
in 
chief, 
than 
to 
be 
busy 
in 
all. 
Embrace 
and 
invite 
helps, 
and 
advices, 
touching 
the 
execution 
of 
thy 
place; 
and 
do 
not 
drive 
away 
such, 
as 
bring 
thee 
information, 
as 
meddlers; 
but 
accept 
of 
them 
in 
good 
part. 
The 
vices 
of 
authority 
are 
chiefly 
four: 
delays, 
corruption, 
roughness, 
and 
facility. 
For 
delays: 
give 
easy 
access; 
keep 
times 
appointed; 
go 
through 
with 
that 
which 
is 
in 
hand, 
and 
interlace 
not 
business, 
but 
of 
necessity. 
For 
corruption: 
do 
not 
only 
bind 
thine 
own 
hands, 
or, 
thy 
servants’ 
hands, 
from 
taking, 
but 
bind 
the 
hands 
of 
suitors 
also, 
from 
offering. 
For 
integrity 
used 
doth 
the 
one; 
but 
integrity 
professed, 
and 
with 
a 
manifest 
detestation 
of 
bribery, 
doth 
the 
other. 
And 
avoid 
not 
only 
the 
fault, 
but 
the 
suspicion. 
Whosoever 
is 
found 
variable, 
and 
changeth 
manifestly 
without 
manifest 
cause, 
giveth 
suspicion 
of 
corruption. 
Therefore 
always, 
when 
thou 
changest 
thine 
opinion 
or 
course, 
profess 
it 
plainly, 
and 
declare 
it, 
together 
with 
the 
reasons 
that 
move 
thee 
to 
change; 
and 
do 
not 
think 
to 
steal 
it. 
A 
servant 
or 
a 
favorite, 
if 
he 
be 
inward, 
and 
no 
other 
apparent 
cause 
of 
esteem, 
is 
commonly 
thought, 
but 
a 
by-way 
to 
close 
corruption. 
For 
roughness: 
it 
is 
a 
needless 
cause 
of 
discontent: 
severity 
breedeth 
fear, 
but 
roughness 
breedeth 
hate. 
Even 
reproofs 
from 
authority, 
ought 
to 
be 
grave, 
and 
not 
taunting. 
As 
for 
facility: 
it 
is 
worse 
than 
bribery. 
For 
bribes 
come 
but 
now 
and 
then; 
but 
if 
importunity, 
or 
idle 
respects, 
lead 
a 
man, 
he 
shall 
never 
be 
without. 
As 
Solomon 
saith, 
To 
respect 
persons 
is 
not 
good; 
for 
such 
a 
man 
will 
transgress 
for 
a 
piece 
of 
bread. 
It 
is 
most 
true, 
that 
was 
anciently 
spoken, 
A 
place 
showeth 
the 
man. 
And 
it 
showeth 
some 
to 
the 
better, 
and 
some 
to 
the 
worse. 
Omnium 
consensu 
capax 
imperii, 
nisi 
imperasset, 
saith 
Tacitus 
of 
Galba; 
but 



of 
Vespasian 
he 
saith, 
Solus 
imperantium, 
Vespasianus 
mutatus 
in 
melius; 
though 
the 
one 
was 
meant 
of 
sufficiency, 
the 
other 
of 
manners, 
and 
affection. 
It 
is 
an 
assured 
sign 
of 
a 
worthy 
and 
generous 
spirit, 
whom 
honor 
amends. 
For 
honor 
is, 
or 
should 
be, 
the 
place 
of 
virtue 
and 
as 
in 
nature, 
things 
move 
violently 
to 
their 
place, 
and 
calmly 
in 
their 
place, 
so 
virtue 
in 
ambition 
is 
violent, 
in 
authority 
settled 
and 
calm. 
All 
rising 
to 
great 
place 
is 
by 
a 
winding 
star; 
and 
if 
there 
be 
factions, 
it 
is 
good 
to 
side 
a 
man’s 
self, 
whilst 
he 
is 
in 
the 
rising, 
and 
to 
balance 
himself 
when 
he 
is 
placed. 
Use 
the 
memory 
of 
thy 
predecessor, 
fairly 
and 
tenderly; 
for 
if 
thou 
dost 
not, 
it 
is 
a 
debt 
will 
sure 
be 
paid 
when 
thou 
art 
gone. 
If 
thou 
have 
colleagues, 
respect 
them, 
and 
rather 
call 
them, 
when 
they 
look 
not 
for 
it, 
than 
exclude 
them, 
when 
they 
have 
reason 
to 
look 
to 
be 
called. 
Be 
not 
too 
sensible, 
or 
too 
remembering, 
of 
thy 
place 
in 
conversation, 
and 
private 
answers 
to 
suitors; 
but 
let 
it 
rather 
be 
said, 
When 
he 
sits 
in 
place, 
he 
is 
another 
man. 



OF 
BOLDNESS 


It 
is 
a 
trivial 
grammar-school 
text, 
but 
yet 
worthy 
a 
wise 
man’s 
consideration. 
Question 
was 
asked 
of 
Demosthenes, 
what 
was 
the 
chief 
part 
of 
an 
orator? 
he 
answered, 
action; 
what 
next? 
action; 
what 
next 
again? 
action. 
He 
said 
it, 
that 
knew 
it 
best, 
and 
had, 
by 
nature, 
himself 
no 
advantage 
in 
that 
he 
commended. 
A 
strange 
thing, 
that 
that 
of 
an 
orator, 
which 
is 
but 
superficial 
and 
rather 
the 
virtue 
of 
a 
player, 
should 
be 
placed 
so 
high, 
above 
those 
other 
noble 
parts, 
of 
invention, 
elocution, 
and 
the 
rest; 
nay, 
almost 
alone, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
all 
in 
all. 
But 
the 
reason 
is 
plain. 
There 
is 
in 
human 
nature 
generally, 
more 
of 
the 
fool 
than 
of 
the 
wise; 
and 
therefore 
those 
faculties, 
by 
which 
the 
foolish 
part 
of 
men’s 
minds 
is 
taken, 
are 
most 
potent. 
Wonderful 
like 
is 
the 
case 
of 
boldness 
in 
civil 
business: 
what 
first? 
boldness; 
what 
second 
and 
third? 
boldness. 
And 
yet 
boldness 
is 
a 
child 
of 
ignorance 
and 
baseness, 
far 
inferior 
to 
other 
parts. 
But 
nevertheless 
it 
doth 
fascinate, 
and 
bind 
hand 
and 
foot, 
those 
that 
are 
either 
shallow 
in 
judgment, 
or 
weak 
in 
courage, 
which 
are 
the 
greatest 
part; 
yea 
and 
prevaileth 
with 
wise 
men 
at 
weak 
times. 
Therefore 
we 
see 
it 
hath 
done 
wonders, 
in 
popular 
states; 
but 
with 
senates, 
and 
princes 
less; 
and 
more 
ever 
upon 
the 
first 
entrance 
of 
bold 
persons 
into 
action, 
than 
soon 
after; 
for 
boldness 
is 
an 
ill 
keeper 
of 
promise. 
Surely, 
as 
there 
are 
mountebanks 
for 
the 
natural 
body, 
so 
are 
there 
mountebanks 
for 
the 
politic 
body; 
men 
that 
undertake 
great 
cures, 
and 
perhaps 
have 
been 
lucky, 
in 
two 
or 
three 
experiments, 
but 
want 
the 
grounds 
of 
science, 
and 
therefore 
cannot 
hold 
out. 
Nay, 
you 
shall 
see 
a 
bold 
fellow 
many 
times 
do 
Mahomet’s 
miracle. 
Mahomet 
made 
the 
people 
believe 
that 
he 
would 
call 
an 
hill 
to 
him, 
and 
from 
the 
top 
of 
it 
offer 
up 
his 
prayers, 
for 
the 
observers 
of 
his 
law. 
The 
people 
assembled; 
Mahomet 
called 
the 
hill 
to 
come 
to 
him, 
again 
and 
again; 
and 
when 
the 
hill 
stood 
still, 
he 
was 
never 
a 
whit 
abashed, 
but 
said, 
If 
the 
hill 
will 
not 
come 
to 
Mahomet, 
Mahomet, 
will 
go 
to 
the 
hill. 
So 
these 
men, 
when 
they 
have 
promised 
great 
matters, 
and 
failed 
most 
shamefully, 
yet 
(if 
they 
have 
the 
perfection 
of 
boldness) 
they 
will 
but 
slight 
it 
over, 
and 
make 
a 
turn, 
and 
no 
more 
ado. 
Certainly 
to 
men 
of 
great 
judgment, 
bold 
persons 
are 
a 
sport 
to 
behold; 
nay, 
and 
to 
the 
vulgar 
also, 
boldness 
has 
somewhat 
of 
the 
ridiculous. 
For 
if 
absurdity 
be 
the 
subject 
of 



laughter, 
doubt 
you 
not 
but 
great 
boldness 
is 
seldom 
without 
some 
absurdity. 
Especially 
it 
is 
a 
sport 
to 
see, 
when 
a 
bold 
fellow 
is 
out 
of 
countenance; 
for 
that 
puts 
his 
face 
into 
a 
most 
shrunken, 
and 
wooden 
posture; 
as 
needs 
it 
must; 
for 
in 
bashfulness, 
the 
spirits 
do 
a 
little 
go 
and 
come; 
but 
with 
bold 
men, 
upon 
like 
occasion, 
they 
stand 
at 
a 
stay; 
like 
a 
stale 
at 
chess, 
where 
it 
is 
no 
mate, 
but 
yet 
the 
game 
cannot 
stir. 
But 
this 
last 
were 
fitter 
for 
a 
satire 
than 
for 
a 
serious 
observation. 
This 
is 
well 
to 
be 
weighed; 
that 
boldness 
is 
ever 
blind; 
for 
it 
seeth 
not 
danger, 
and 
inconveniences. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
ill 
in 
counsel, 
good 
in 
execution; 
so 
that 
the 
right 
use 
of 
bold 
persons 
is, 
that 
they 
never 
command 
in 
chief, 
but 
be 
seconds, 
and 
under 
the 
direction 
of 
others. 
For 
in 
counsel, 
it 
is 
good 
to 
see 
dangers; 
and 
in 
execution, 
not 
to 
see 
them, 
except 
they 
be 
very 
great. 



OF 
GOODNESS 
AND 
GOODNESS 
OF 
NATURE 


I 
take 
goodness 
in 
this 
sense, 
the 
affecting 
of 
the 
weal 
of 
men, 
which 
is 
that 
the 
Grecians 
call 
philanthropia; 
and 
the 
word 
humanity, 
(as 
it 
is 
used) 
is 
a 
little 
too 
light 
to 
express 
it. 
Goodness 
I 
call 
the 
habit, 
and 
goodness 
of 
nature, 
the 
inclination. 
This 
of 
all 
virtues, 
and 
dignities 
of 
the 
mind, 
is 
the 
greatest; 
being 
the 
character 
of 
the 
Deity: 
and 
without 
it, 
man 
is 
a 
busy, 
mischievous, 
wretched 
thing; 
no 
better 
than 
a 
kind 
of 
vermin. 
Goodness 
answers 
to 
the 
theological 
virtue, 
charity, 
and 
admits 
no 
excess, 
but 
error. 
The 
desire 
of 
power 
in 
excess, 
caused 
the 
angels 
to 
fall; 
the 
desire 
of 
knowledge 
in 
excess, 
caused 
man 
to 
fall: 
but 
in 
charity 
there 
is 
no 
excess; 
neither 
can 
angel, 
nor 
man, 
come 
in 
danger 
by 
it. 
The 
inclination 
to 
goodness, 
is 
imprinted 
deeply 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
man; 
insomuch, 
that 
if 
it 
issue 
not 
towards 
men, 
it 
will 
take 
unto 
other 
living 
creatures; 
as 
it 
is 
seen 
in 
the 
Turks, 
a 
cruel 
people, 
who 
nevertheless 
are 
kind 
to 
beasts, 
and 
give 
alms, 
to 
dogs 
and 
birds; 
insomuch, 
as 
Busbechius 
reporteth, 
a 
Christian 
boy, 
in 
Constantinople, 
had 
like 
to 
have 
been 
stoned, 
for 
gagging 
in 
a 
waggishness 
a 
long-billed 
fowl. 
Errors 
indeed 
in 
this 
virtue 
of 
goodness, 
or 
charity, 
may 
be 
committed. 
The 
Italians 
have 
an 
ungracious 
proverb, 
Tanto 
buon 
che 
val 
niente: 
so 
good, 
that 
he 
is 
good 
for 
nothing. 
And 
one 
of 
the 
doctors 
of 
Italy, 
Nicholas 
Machiavel, 
had 
the 
confidence 
to 
put 
in 
writing, 
almost 
in 
plain 
terms, 
That 
the 
Christian 
faith, 
had 
given 
up 
good 
men, 
in 
prey 
to 
those 
that 
are 
tyrannical 
and 
unjust. 
Which 
he 
spake, 
because 
indeed 
there 
was 
never 
law, 
or 
sect, 
or 
opinion, 
did 
so 
much 
magnify 
goodness, 
as 
the 
Christian 
religion 
doth. 
Therefore, 
to 
avoid 
the 
scandal 
and 
the 
danger 
both, 
it 
is 
good, 
to 
take 
knowledge 
of 
the 
errors 
of 
an 
habit 
so 
excellent. 
Seek 
the 
good 
of 
other 
men, 
but 
be 
not 
in 
bondage 
to 
their 
faces 
or 
fancies; 
for 
that 
is 
but 
facility, 
or 
softness; 
which 
taketh 
an 
honest 
mind 
prisoner. 
Neither 
give 
thou 
AEsop’s 
cock 
a 
gem, 
who 
would 
be 
better 
pleased, 
and 
happier, 
if 
he 
had 
had 
barley-corn. 
The 
example 
of 
God, 
teacheth 
the 
lesson 
truly: 
He 
sendeth 
his 
rain, 
and 
maketh 
his 
sun 
to 
shine, 
upon 
the 
just 
and 
unjust; 
but 
he 
doth 
not 
rain 
wealth, 
nor 
shine 
honor 
and 
virtues, 
upon 
men 
equally. 
Common 
benefits, 
are 
to 
be 
communicate 
with 
all; 
but 
peculiar 
benefits, 
with 
choice. 
And 
beware 
how 
in 
making 
the 
portraiture, 
thou 
breakest 
the 
pattern. 
For 



divinity, 
maketh 
the 
love 
of 
ourselves 
the 
pattern; 
the 
love 
of 
our 
neighbors, 
but 
the 
portraiture. 
Sell 
all 
thou 
hast, 
and 
give 
it 
to 
the 
poor, 
and 
follow 
me: 
but, 
sell 
not 
all 
thou 
hast, 
except 
thou 
come 
and 
follow 
me; 
that 
is, 
except 
thou 
have 
a 
vocation, 
wherein 
thou 
mayest 
do 
as 
much 
good, 
with 
little 
means 
as 
with 
great; 
for 
otherwise, 
in 
feeding 
the 
streams, 
thou 
driest 
the 
fountain. 
Neither 
is 
there 
only 
a 
habit 
of 
goodness, 
directed 
by 
right 
reason; 
but 
there 
is 
in 
some 
men, 
even 
in 
nature, 
a 
disposition 
towards 
it; 
as 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
there 
is 
a 
natural 
malignity. 
For 
there 
be 
that 
in 
their 
nature 
do 
not 
affect 
the 
good 
of 
others. 
The 
lighter 
sort 
of 
malignity, 
turneth 
but 
to 
a 
crossness, 
or 
frowardness, 
or 
aptness 
to 
oppose, 
or 
difficulties, 
or 
the 
like; 
but 
the 
deeper 
sort, 
to 
envy 
and 
mere 
mischief. 
Such 
men, 
in 
other 
men’s 
calamities, 
are, 
as 
it 
were, 
in 
season, 
and 
are 
ever 
on 
the 
loading 
part: 
not 
so 
good 
as 
the 
dogs, 
that 
licked 
Lazarus’ 
sores; 
but 
like 
Ries, 
that 
are 
still 
buzzing 
upon 
any 
thing 
that 
is 
raw; 
misanthropi, 
that 
make 
it 
their 
practice, 
to 
bring 
men 
to 
the 
bough, 
and 
yet 
never 
a 
tree 
for 
the 
purpose 
in 
their 
gardens, 
as 
Timon 
had. 
Such 
dispositions, 
are 
the 
very 
errors 
of 
human 
nature; 
and 
yet 
they 
are 
the 
fittest 
timber, 
to 
make 
great 
pontics 
of; 
like 
to 
knee 
timber, 
that 
is 
good 
for 
ships, 
that 
are 
ordained 
to 
be 
tossed; 
but 
not 
for 
building 
houses, 
that 
shall 
stand 
firm. 
The 
parts 
and 
signs 
of 
goodness, 
are 
many. 
If 
a 
man 
be 
gracious 
and 
courteous 
to 
strangers, 
it 
shows 
he 
is 
a 
citizen 
of 
the 
world, 
and 
that 
his 
heart 
is 
no 
island, 
cut 
off 
from 
other 
lands, 
but 
a 
continent, 
that 
joins 
to 
them. 
If 
he 
be 
compassionate 
towards 
the 
afflictions 
of 
others, 
it 
shows 
that 
his 
heart 
is 
like 
the 
noble 
tree, 
that 
is 
wounded 
itself, 
when 
it 
gives 
the 
balm. 
If 
he 
easily 
pardons, 
and 
remits 
offences, 
it 
shows 
that 
his 
mind 
is 
planted 
above 
injuries; 
so 
that 
he 
cannot 
be 
shot. 
If 
he 
be 
thankful 
for 
small 
benefits, 
it 
shows 
that 
he 
weighs 
men’s 
minds, 
and 
not 
their 
trash. 
But 
above 
all 
if 
he 
have 
St. 
Paul’s 
perfection, 
that 
he 
would 
wish 
to 
be 
anathema 
from 
Christ, 
for 
the 
salvation 
of 
his 
brethren, 
it 
shows 
much 
of 
a 
divine 
nature, 
and 
a 
kind 
of 
conformity 
with 
Christ 
himself. 



OF 
NOBILITY 


We 
will 
speak 
of 
nobility, 
first 
as 
a 
portion 
of 
an 
estate, 
then 
as 
a 
condition 
of 
particular 
persons. 
A 
monarchy, 
where 
there 
is 
no 
nobility 
at 
all, 
is 
ever 
a 
pure 
and 
absolute 
tyranny; 
as 
that 
of 
the 
Turks. 
For 
nobility 
attempers 
sovereignty, 
and 
draws 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
people, 
somewhat 
aside 
from 
the 
line 
royal. 
But 
for 
democracies, 
they 
need 
it 
not; 
and 
they 
are 
commonly 
more 
quiet, 
and 
less 
subject 
to 
sedition, 
than 
where 
there 
are 
stirps 
of 
nobles. 
For 
men’s 
eyes 
are 
upon 
the 
business, 
and 
not 
upon 
the 
persons; 
or 
if 
upon 
the 
persons, 
it 
is 
for 
the 
business’ 
sake, 
as 
fittest, 
and 
not 
for 
flags 
and 
pedigree. 
We 
see 
the 
Switzers 
last 
well, 
notwithstanding 
their 
diversity 
of 
religion, 
and 
of 
cantons. 
For 
utility 
is 
their 
bond, 
and 
not 
respects. 
The 
united 
provinces 
of 
the 
Low 
Countries, 
in 
their 
government, 
excel; 
for 
where 
there 
is 
an 
equality, 
the 
consultations 
are 
more 
indifferent, 
and 
the 
payments 
and 
tributes, 
more 
cheerful. 
A 
great 
and 
potent 
nobility, 
addeth 
majesty 
to 
a 
monarch, 
but 
diminisheth 
power; 
and 
putteth 
life 
and 
spirit 
into 
the 
people, 
but 
presseth 
their 
fortune. 
It 
is 
well, 
when 
nobles 
are 
not 
too 
great 
for 
sovereignty 
nor 
for 
justice; 
and 
yet 
maintained 
in 
that 
height, 
as 
the 
insolency 
of 
inferiors 
may 
be 
broken 
upon 
them, 
before 
it 
come 
on 
too 
fast 
upon 
the 
majesty 
of 
kings. 
A 
numerous 
nobility 
causeth 
poverty, 
and 
inconvenience 
in 
a 
state; 
for 
it 
is 
a 
surcharge 
of 
expense; 
and 
besides, 
it 
being 
of 
necessity, 
that 
many 
of 
the 
nobility 
fall, 
in 
time, 
to 
be 
weak 
in 
fortune, 
it 
maketh 
a 
kind 
of 
disproportion, 
between 
honor 
and 
means. 


As 
for 
nobility 
in 
particular 
persons; 
it 
is 
a 
reverend 
thing, 
to 
see 
an 
ancient 
castle 
or 
building, 
not 
in 
decay; 
or 
to 
see 
a 
fair 
timber 
tree, 
sound 
and 
perfect. 
How 
much 
more, 
to 
behold 
an 
ancient 
noble 
family, 
which 
has 
stood 
against 
the 
waves 
and 
weathers 
of 
time! 
For 
new 
nobility 
is 
but 
the 
act 
of 
power, 
but 
ancient 
nobility 
is 
the 
act 
of 
time. 
Those 
that 
are 
first 
raised 
to 
nobility, 
are 
commonly 
more 
virtuous, 
but 
less 
innocent, 
than 
their 
descendants; 
for 
there 
is 
rarely 
any 
rising, 
but 
by 
a 
commixture 
of 
good 
and 
evil 
arts. 
But 
it 
is 
reason, 
the 
memory 
of 
their 
virtues 
remain 
to 
their 
posterity, 
and 
their 
faults 
die 
with 
themselves. 
Nobility 
of 
birth 
commonly 
abateth 
industry; 
and 
he 
that 
is 
not 
industrious, 
envieth 
him 
that 
is. 
Besides, 



noble 
persons 
cannot 
go 
much 
higher; 
and 
he 
that 
standeth 
at 
a 
stay, 
when 
others 
rise, 
can 
hardly 
avoid 
motions 
of 
envy. 
On 
the 
other 
side, 
nobility 
extinguisheth 
the 
passive 
envy 
from 
others, 
towards 
them; 
because 
they 
are 
in 
possession 
of 
honor. 
Certainly, 
kings 
that 
have 
able 
men 
of 
their 
nobility, 
shall 
find 
ease 
in 
employing 
them, 
and 
a 
better 
slide 
into 
their 
business; 
for 
people 
naturally 
bend 
to 
them, 
as 
born 
in 
some 
sort 
to 
command. 



OF 
SEDITIONS 
AND 
TROUBLES 


Shepherds 
of 
people, 
had 
need 
know 
the 
calendars 
of 
tempests 
in 
state; 
which 
are 
commonly 
greatest, 
when 
things 
grow 
to 
equality; 
as 
natural 
tempests 
are 
greatest 
about 
the 
Equinoctia. 
And 
as 
there 
are 
certain 
hollow 
blasts 
of 
wind, 
and 
secret 
swellings 
of 
seas 
before 
a 
tempest, 
so 
are 
there 
in 
states: 


— 
Ille 
etiam 
caecos 
instare 
tumultus 
Saepe 
monet, 
fraudesque 
et 
operta 
tunescere 
bella. 
Libels 
and 
licentious 
discourses 
against 
the 
state, 
when 
they 
are 
frequent 
and 
open; 
and 
in 
like 
sort, 
false 
news 
often 
running 
up 
and 
down, 
to 
the 
disadvantage 
of 
the 
state, 
and 
hastily 
embraced; 
are 
amongst 
the 
signs 
of 
troubles. 
Virgil, 
giving 
the 
pedigree 
of 
Fame, 
saith, 
she 
was 
sister 
to 
the 
Giants: 


Illam 
Terra 
parens, 
ira 
irritata 
deorum, 
Extremam 
(ut 
perhibent) 
Coeo 
Enceladoque 
sororem 
Progenuit.– 


As 
if 
fames 
were 
the 
relics 
of 
seditions 
past; 
but 
they 
are 
no 
less, 
indeed, 
the 
preludes 
of 
seditions 
to 
come. 
Howsoever 
he 
noteth 
it 
right, 
that 
seditious 
tumults, 
and 
seditious 
fames, 
differ 
no 
more 
but 
as 
brother 
and 
sister, 
masculine 
and 
feminine; 
especially 
if 
it 
come 
to 
that, 
that 
the 
best 
actions 
of 
a 
state, 
and 
the 
most 
plausible, 
and 
which 
ought 
to 
give 
greatest 
contentment, 
are 
taken 
in 
ill 
sense, 
and 
traduced: 
for 
that 
shows 
the 
envy 
great, 
as 
Tacitus 
saith; 
conflata 
magna 
invidia, 
seu 
bene 
seu 
male 
gesta 
premunt. 
Neither 
doth 
it 
follow, 
that 
because 
these 
fames 
are 
a 
sign 
of 
troubles, 
that 
the 
suppressing 
of 
them 
with 
too 
much 
severity, 
should 
be 
a 
remedy 
of 
troubles. 
For 
the 
despising 
of 
them, 
many 
times 
checks 
them 
best; 
and 
the 
going 
about 
to 
stop 
them, 
doth 
but 
make 
a 
wonder 
long-lived. 
Also 
that 
kind 
of 
obedience, 
which 
Tacitus 
speaketh 
of, 
is 
to 
be 
held 
suspected: 
Erant 
in 
officio, 
sed 
tamen 
qui 
mallent 
mandata 
imperantium 
interpretari 



quam 
exequi 
disputing, 
excusing, 
cavilling 
upon 
mandates 
and 
directions, 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
shaking 
off 
the 
yoke, 
and 
assay 
of 
disobedience; 
especially 
if 
in 
those 
disputings, 
they 
which 
are 
for 
the 
direction, 
speak 
fearfully 
and 
tenderly, 
and 
those 
that 
are 
against 
it, 
audaciously. 


Also, 
as 
Machiavel 
noteth 
well, 
when 
princes, 
that 
ought 
to 
be 
common 
parents, 
make 
themselves 
as 
a 
party, 
and 
lean 
to 
a 
side, 
it 
is 
as 
a 
boat, 
that 
is 
overthrown 
by 
uneven 
weight 
on 
the 
one 
side; 
as 
was 
well 
seen, 
in 
the 
time 
of 
Henry 
the 
Third 
of 
France; 
for 
first, 
himself 
entered 
league 
for 
the 
extirpation 
of 
the 
Protestants; 
and 
presently 
after, 
the 
same 
league 
was 
turned 
upon 
himself. 
For 
when 
the 
authority 
of 
princes, 
is 
made 
but 
an 
accessory 
to 
a 
cause, 
and 
that 
there 
be 
other 
bands, 
that 
tie 
faster 
than 
the 
band 
of 
sovereignty, 
kings 
begin 
to 
be 
put 
almost 
out 
of 
possession. 


Also, 
when 
discords, 
and 
quarrels, 
and 
factions 
are 
carried 
openly 
and 
audaciously, 
it 
is 
a 
sign 
the 
reverence 
of 
government 
is 
lost. 
For 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
greatest 
persons 
in 
a 
government, 
ought 
to 
be 
as 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
planets 
under 
primum 
mobile; 
according 
to 
the 
old 
opinion: 
which 
is, 
that 
every 
of 
them, 
is 
carried 
swiftly 
by 
the 
highest 
motion, 
and 
softly 
in 
their 
own 
motion. 
And 
therefore, 
when 
great 
ones 
in 
their 
own 
particular 
motion, 
move 
violently, 
and, 
as 
Tacitus 
expresseth 
it 
well, 
liberius 
quam 
ut 
imperantium 
meminissent; 
it 
is 
a 
sign 
the 
orbs 
are 
out 
of 
frame. 
For 
reverence 
is 
that? 
wherewith 
princes 
are 
girt 
from 
God; 
who 
threateneth 
the 
dissolving 
thereof; 
Solvam 
cingula 
regum. 


So 
when 
any 
of 
the 
four 
pillars 
of 
government, 
are 
mainly 
shaken, 
or 
weakened 
(which 
are 
religion, 
justice, 
counsel, 
and 
treasure), 
men 
had 
need 
to 
pray 
for 
fair 
weather. 
But 
let 
us 
pass 
from 
this 
part 
of 
predictions 
(concerning 
which, 
nevertheless, 
more 
light 
may 
be 
taken 
from 
that 
which 
followeth); 
and 
let 
us 
speak 
first, 
of 
the 
materials 
of 
seditions; 
then 
of 
the 
motives 
of 
them; 
and 
thirdly 
of 
the 
remedies. 


Concerning 
the 
materials 
of 
seditions. 
It 
is 
a 
thing 
well 
to 
be 
considered; 
for 
the 
surest 
way 
to 
prevent 
seditions 
(if 
the 
times 
do 
bear 
it) 
is 
to 
take 
away 
the 
matter 
of 
them. 
For 
if 
there 
be 
fuel 
prepared, 
it 
is 
hard 
to 
tell, 
whence 
the 
spark 
shall 
come, 
that 
shall 
set 
it 
on 
fire. 
The 
matter 
of 
seditions 
is 
of 
two 
kinds: 
much 
poverty, 
and 
much 
discontentment. 
It 
is 
certain, 
so 
many 
overthrown 
estates, 
so 
many 
votes 
for 
troubles. 
Lucan 
noteth 
well 
the 
state 
of 
Rome 
before 
the 
Civil 
War, 



Hinc 
usura 
vorax, 
rapidumque 
in 
tempore 
foenus, 
Hinc 
concussa 
fides, 
et 
multis 
utile 
bellum. 


This 
same 
multis 
utile 
bellum, 
is 
an 
assured 
and 
infallible 
sign, 
of 
a 
state 
disposed 
to 
seditions 
and 
troubles. 
And 
if 
this 
poverty 
and 
broken 
estate 
in 
the 
better 
sort, 
be 
joined 
with 
a 
want 
and 
necessity 
in 
the 
mean 
people, 
the 
danger 
is 
imminent 
and 
great. 
For 
the 
rebellions 
of 
the 
belly 
are 
the 
worst. 
As 
for 
discontentments, 
they 
are, 
in 
the 
politic 
body, 
like 
to 
humors 
in 
the 
natural, 
which 
are 
apt 
to 
gather 
a 
preternatural 
heat, 
and 
to 
inflame. 
And 
let 
no 
prince 
measure 
the 
danger 
of 
them 
by 
this, 
whether 
they 
be 
just 
or 
unjust: 
for 
that 
were 
to 
imagine 
people, 
to 
be 
too 
reasonable; 
who 
do 
often 
spurn 
at 
their 
own 
good: 
nor 
yet 
by 
this, 
whether 
the 
griefs 
whereupon 
they 
rise, 
be 
in 
fact 
great 
or 
small: 
for 
they 
are 
the 
most 
dangerous 
discontentments, 
where 
the 
fear 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
feeling. 
Dolendi 
modus, 
timendi 
non 
item. 
Besides, 
in 
great 
oppressions, 
the 
same 
things 
that 
provoke 
the 
patience, 
do 
withal 
mate 
the 
courage; 
but 
in 
fears 
it 
is 
not 
so. 
Neither 
let 
any 
prince, 
or 
state, 
be 
secure 
concerning 
discontentments, 
because 
they 
have 
been 
often, 
or 
have 
been 
long, 
and 
yet 
no 
peril 
hath 
ensued: 
for 
as 
it 
is 
true, 
that 
every 
vapor 
or 
fume 
doth 
not 
turn 
into 
a 
storm; 
so 
it 
is 
nevertheless 
true, 
that 
storms, 
though 
they 
blow 
over 
divers 
times, 
yet 
may 
fall 
at 
last; 
and, 
as 
the 
Spanish 
proverb 
noteth 
well, 
The 
cord 
breaketh 
at 
the 
last 
by 
the 
weakest 
pull. 


The 
causes 
and 
motives 
of 
seditions 
are, 
innovation 
in 
religion; 
taxes; 
alteration 
of 
laws 
and 
customs; 
breaking 
of 
privileges; 
general 
oppression; 
advancement 
of 
unworthy 
persons; 
strangers; 
dearths; 
disbanded 
soldiers; 
factions 
grown 
desperate; 
and 
what 
soever, 
in 
offending 
people, 
joineth 
and 
knitteth 
them 
in 
a 
common 
cause. 


For 
the 
remedies; 
there 
may 
be 
some 
general 
preservatives, 
whereof 
we 
will 
speak: 
as 
for 
the 
just 
cure, 
it 
must 
answer 
to 
the 
particular 
disease; 
and 
so 
be 
left 
to 
counsel, 
rather 
than 
rule. 


The 
first 
remedy 
or 
prevention 
is 
to 
remove, 
by 
all 
means 
possible, 
that 
material 
cause 
of 
sedition 
whereof 
we 
spake; 
which 
is, 
want 
and 
poverty 
in 
the 
estate. 
To 
which 
purpose 
serveth 
the 
opening, 
and 
well-balancing 
of 
trade; 
the 
cherishing 
of 
manufactures; 
the 
banishing 
of 
idleness; 
the 
repressing 
of 
waste, 
and 
excess, 
by 
sumptuary 
laws; 
the 
improvement 
and 
husbanding 
of 
the 
soil; 
the 
regulating 
of 
prices 
of 
things 
vendible; 
the 



moderating 
of 
taxes 
and 
tributes; 
and 
the 
like. 
Generally, 
it 
is 
to 
be 
foreseen 
that 
the 
population 
of 
a 
kingdom 
(especially 
if 
it 
be 
not 
mown 
down 
by 
wars) 
do 
not 
exceed 
the 
stock 
of 
the 
kingdom, 
which 
should 
maintain 
them. 
Neither 
is 
the 
population 
to 
be 
reckoned 
only 
by 
number; 
for 
a 
smaller 
number, 
that 
spend 
more 
and 
earn 
less, 
do 
wear 
out 
an 
estate 
sooner, 
than 
a 
greater 
number 
that 
live 
lower, 
and 
gather 
more. 
Therefore 
the 
multiplying 
of 
nobility, 
and 
other 
degrees 
of 
quality, 
in 
an 
over 
proportion 
to 
the 
common 
people, 
doth 
speedily 
bring 
a 
state 
to 
necessity; 
and 
so 
doth 
likewise 
an 
overgrown 
clergy; 
for 
they 
bring 
nothing 
to 
the 
stock; 
and 
in 
like 
manner, 
when 
more 
are 
bred 
scholars, 
than 
preferments 
can 
take 
off. 


It 
is 
likewise 
to 
be 
remembered, 
that 
forasmuch 
as 
the 
increase 
of 
any 
estate 
must 
be 
upon 
the 
foreigner 
(for 
whatsoever 
is 
somewhere 
gotten, 
is 
somewhere 
lost), 
there 
be 
but 
three 
things, 
which 
one 
nation 
selleth 
unto 
another; 
the 
commodity 
as 
nature 
yieldeth 
it; 
the 
manufacture; 
and 
the 
vecture, 
or 
carriage. 
So 
that 
if 
these 
three 
wheels 
go, 
wealth 
will 
flow 
as 
in 
a 
spring 
tide. 
And 
it 
cometh 
many 
times 
to 
pass, 
that 
materiam 
superabit 
opus; 
that 
the 
work 
and 
carriage 
is 
more 
worth 
than 
the 
material, 
and 
enricheth 
a 
state 
more; 
as 
is 
notably 
seen 
in 
the 
Low–Countrymen, 
who 
have 
the 
best 
mines 
above 
ground, 
in 
the 
world. 


Above 
all 
things, 
good 
policy 
is 
to 
be 
used, 
that 
the 
treasure 
and 
moneys, 
in 
a 
state, 
be 
not 
gathered 
into 
few 
hands. 
For 
otherwise 
a 
state 
may 
have 
a 
great 
stock, 
and 
yet 
starve. 
And 
money 
is 
like 
muck, 
not 
good 
except 
it 
be 
spread. 
This 
is 
done, 
chiefly 
by 
suppressing, 
or 
at 
least 
keeping 
a 
strait 
hand, 
upon 
the 
devouring 
trades 
of 
usury, 
ingrossing 
great 
pasturages, 
and 
the 
like. 


For 
removing 
discontentments, 
or 
at 
least 
the 
danger 
of 
them; 
there 
is 
in 
every 
state 
(as 
we 
know) 
two 
portions 
of 
subjects; 
the 
noblesse 
and 
the 
commonalty. 
When 
one 
of 
these 
is 
discontent, 
the 
danger 
is 
not 
great; 
for 
common 
people 
are 
of 
slow 
motion, 
if 
they 
be 
not 
excited 
by 
the 
greater 
sort; 
and 
the 
greater 
sort 
are 
of 
small 
strength, 
except 
the 
multitude 
be 
apt, 
and 
ready 
to 
move 
of 
themselves. 
Then 
is 
the 
danger, 
when 
the 
greater 
sort, 
do 
but 
wait 
for 
the 
troubling 
of 
the 
waters 
amongst 
the 
meaner, 
that 
then 
they 
may 
declare 
themselves. 
The 
poets 
feign, 
that 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
gods 
would 
have 
bound 
Jupiter; 
which 
he 
hearing 
of, 
by 
the 
counsel 
of 
Pallas, 
sent 
for 
Briareus, 
with 
his 
hundred 
hands, 
to 
come 
in 
to 
his 
aid. 
An 
emblem, 
no 
doubt, 
to 
show 
how 
safe 
it 
is 
for 
monarchs, 
to 
make 
sure 
of 
the 
good 
will 
of 



common 
people. 
To 
give 
moderate 
liberty 
for 
griefs 
and 
discontentments 
to 
evaporate 
(so 
it 
be 
without 
too 
great 
insolency 
or 
bravery), 
is 
a 
safe 
way. 
For 
he 
that 
turneth 
the 
humors 
back, 
and 
maketh 
the 
wound 
bleed 
inwards, 
endangereth 
malign 
ulcers, 
and 
pernicious 
imposthumations. 


The 
part 
of 
Epimetheus 
mought 
well 
become 
Prometheus, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
discontentments: 
for 
there 
is 
not 
a 
better 
provision 
against 
them. 
Epimetheus, 
when 
griefs 
and 
evils 
flew 
abroad, 
at 
last 
shut 
the 
lid, 
and 
kept 
hope 
in 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
vessel. 
Certainly, 
the 
politic 
and 
artificial 
nourishing, 
and 
entertaining 
of 
hopes, 
and 
carrying 
men 
from 
hopes 
to 
hopes, 
is 
one 
of 
the 
best 
antidotes 
against 
the 
poison 
of 
discontentments. 
And 
it 
is 
a 
certain 
sign 
of 
a 
wise 
government 
and 
proceeding, 
when 
it 
can 
hold 
men’s 
hearts 
by 
hopes, 
when 
it 
cannot 
by 
satisfaction; 
and 
when 
it 
can 
handle 
things, 
in 
such 
manner, 
as 
no 
evil 
shall 
appear 
so 
peremptory, 
but 
that 
it 
hath 
some 
outlet 
of 
hope; 
which 
is 
the 
less 
hard 
to 
do, 
because 
both 
particular 
persons 
and 
factions, 
are 
apt 
enough 
to 
flatter 
themselves, 
or 
at 
least 
to 
brave 
that, 
which 
they 
believe 
not. 


Also 
the 
foresight 
and 
prevention, 
that 
there 
be 
no 
likely 
or 
fit 
head, 
whereunto 
discontented 
persons 
may 
resort, 
and 
under 
whom 
they 
may 
join, 
is 
a 
known, 
but 
an 
excellent 
point 
of 
caution. 
I 
understand 
a 
fit 
head, 
to 
be 
one 
that 
hath 
greatness 
and 
reputation; 
that 
hath 
confidence 
with 
the 
discontented 
party, 
and 
upon 
whom 
they 
turn 
their 
eyes; 
and 
that 
is 
thought 
discontented, 
in 
his 
own 
particular: 
which 
kind 
of 
persons, 
are 
either 
to 
be 
won, 
and 
reconciled 
to 
the 
state, 
and 
that 
in 
a 
fast 
and 
true 
manner; 
or 
to 
be 
fronted 
with 
some 
other, 
of 
the 
same 
party, 
that 
may 
oppose 
them, 
and 
so 
divide 
the 
reputation. 
Generally, 
the 
dividing 
and 
breaking, 
of 
all 
factions 
and 
combinations 
that 
are 
adverse 
to 
the 
state, 
and 
setting 
them 
at 
distance, 
or 
at 
least 
distrust, 
amongst 
themselves, 
is 
not 
one 
of 
the 
worst 
remedies. 
For 
it 
is 
a 
desperate 
case, 
if 
those 
that 
hold 
with 
the 
proceeding 
of 
the 
state, 
be 
full 
of 
discord 
and 
faction, 
and 
those 
that 
are 
against 
it, 
be 
entire 
and 
united. 


I 
have 
noted, 
that 
some 
witty 
and 
sharp 
speeches, 
which 
have 
fallen 
from 
princes, 
have 
given 
fire 
to 
seditions. 
Caesar 
did 
himself 
infinite 
hurt 
in 
that 
speech, 
Sylla 
nescivit 
literas, 
non 
potuit 
dictare; 
for 
it 
did 
utterly 
cut 
off 
that 
hope, 
which 
men 
had 
entertained, 
that 
he 
would 
at 
one 
time 
or 
other 
give 
over 
his 
dictatorship. 
Galba 
undid 
himself 
by 
that 
speech, 
legi 
a 
se 
militem, 
non 
emi; 
for 
it 
put 
the 
soldiers 
out 
of 
hope 
of 
the 
donative. 
Probus 
likewise, 
by 
that 
speech, 
Si 
vixero, 
non 
opus 
erit 
amplius 
Romano 
imperio 
militibus; 
a 



speech 
of 
great 
despair 
for 
the 
soldiers. 
And 
many 
the 
like. 
Surely 
princes 
had 
need, 
in 
tender 
matters 
and 
ticklish 
times, 
to 
beware 
what 
they 
say; 
especially 
in 
these 
short 
speeches, 
which 
fly 
abroad 
like 
darts, 
and 
are 
thought 
to 
be 
shot 
out 
of 
their 
secret 
intentions. 
For 
as 
for 
large 
discourses, 
they 
are 
flat 
things, 
and 
not 
so 
much 
noted. 


Lastly, 
let 
princes, 
against 
all 
events, 
not 
be 
without 
some 
great 
person, 
one 
or 
rather 
more, 
of 
military 
valor, 
near 
unto 
them, 
for 
the 
repressing 
of 
seditions 
in 
their 
beginnings. 
For 
without 
that, 
there 
useth 
to 
be 
more 
trepidation 
in 
court 
upon 
the 
first 
breaking 
out 
of 
troubles, 
than 
were 
fit. 
And 
the 
state 
runneth 
the 
danger 
of 
that 
which 
Tacitus 
saith; 
Atque 
is 
habitus 
animorum 
fuit, 
ut 
pessimum 
facinus 
auderent 
pauci, 
plures 
vellent, 
omnes 
paterentur. 
But 
let 
such 
military 
persons 
be 
assured, 
and 
well 
reputed 
of, 
rather 
than 
factious 
and 
popular; 
holding 
also 
good 
correspondence 
with 
the 
other 
great 
men 
in 
the 
state; 
or 
else 
the 
remedy, 
is 
worse 
than 
the 
disease. 



OF 
ATHEISM 


I 
had 
rather 
believe 
all 
the 
fables 
in 
the 
Legend, 
and 
the 
Talmud, 
and 
the 
Alcoran, 
than 
that 
this 
universal 
frame 
is 
without 
a 
mind. 
And 
therefore, 
God 
never 
wrought 
miracle, 
to 
convince 
atheism, 
because 
his 
ordinary 
works 
convince 
it. 
It 
is 
true, 
that 
a 
little 
philosophy 
inclineth 
man’s 
mind 
to 
atheism; 
but 
depth 
in 
philosophy 
bringeth 
men’s 
minds 
about 
to 
religion. 
For 
while 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
looketh 
upon 
second 
causes 
scattered, 
it 
may 
sometimes 
rest 
in 
them, 
and 
go 
no 
further; 
but 
when 
it 
beholdeth 
the 
chain 
of 
them, 
confederate 
and 
linked 
together, 
it 
must 
needs 
fly 
to 
Providence 
and 
Deity. 
Nay, 
even 
that 
school 
which 
is 
most 
accused 
of 
atheism 
doth 
most 
demonstrate 
religion; 
that 
is, 
the 
school 
of 
Leucippus 
and 
Democritus 
and 
Epicurus. 
For 
it 
is 
a 
thousand 
times 
more 
credible, 
that 
four 
mutable 
elements, 
and 
one 
immutable 
fifth 
essence, 
duly 
and 
eternally 
placed, 
need 
no 
God, 
than 
that 
an 
army 
of 
infinite 
small 
portions, 
or 
seeds 
unplaced, 
should 
have 
produced 
this 
order 
and 
beauty, 
without 
a 
divine 
marshal. 
The 
Scripture 
saith, 
The 
fool 
hath 
said 
in 
his 
heart, 
there 
is 
no 
God; 
it 
is 
not 
said, 
The 
fool 
hath 
thought 
in 
his 
heart; 
so 
as 
he 
rather 
saith 
it, 
by 
rote 
to 
himself, 
as 
that 
he 
would 
have, 
than 
that 
he 
can 
thoroughly 
believe 
it, 
or 
be 
persuaded 
of 
it. 
For 
none 
deny, 
there 
is 
a 
God, 
but 
those, 
for 
whom 
it 
maketh 
that 
there 
were 
no 
God. 
It 
appeareth 
in 
nothing 
more, 
that 
atheism 
is 
rather 
in 
the 
lip, 
than 
in 
the 
heart 
of 
man, 
than 
by 
this; 
that 
atheists 
will 
ever 
be 
talking 
of 
that 
their 
opinion, 
as 
if 
they 
fainted 
in 
it, 
within 
themselves, 
and 
would 
be 
glad 
to 
be 
strengthened, 
by 
the 
consent 
of 
others. 
Nay 
more, 
you 
shall 
have 
atheists 
strive 
to 
get 
disciples, 
as 
it 
fareth 
with 
other 
sects. 
And, 
which 
is 
most 
of 
all, 
you 
shall 
have 
of 
them, 
that 
will 
suffer 
for 
atheism, 
and 
not 
recant; 
whereas 
if 
they 
did 
truly 
think, 
that 
there 
were 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
God, 
why 
should 
they 
trouble 
themselves? 
Epicurus 
is 
charged, 
that 
he 
did 
but 
dissemble 
for 
his 
credit’s 
sake, 
when 
he 
affirmed 
there 
were 
blessed 
natures, 
but 
such 
as 
enjoyed 
themselves, 
without 
having 
respect 
to 
the 
government 
of 
the 
world. 
Wherein 
they 
say 
he 
did 
temporize; 
though 
in 
secret, 
he 
thought 
there 
was 
no 
God. 
But 
certainly 
he 
is 
traduced; 
for 
his 
words 
are 
noble 
and 
divine: 
Non 
deos 
vulgi 
negare 
profanum; 
sed 
vulgi 
opiniones 
diis 
applicare 
profanum. 
Plato 
could 
have 
said 
no 
more. 
And 
although 
he 
had 
the 
confidence, 
to 
deny 
the 
administration, 
he 
had 
not 
the 



power, 
to 
deny 
the 
nature. 
The 
Indians 
of 
the 
West, 
have 
names 
for 
their 
particular 
gods, 
though 
they 
have 
no 
name 
for 
God: 
as 
if 
the 
heathens 
should 
have 
had 
the 
names 
Jupiter, 
Apollo, 
Mars, 
etc., 
but 
not 
the 
word 
Deus; 
which 
shows 
that 
even 
those 
barbarous 
people 
have 
the 
notion, 
though 
they 
have 
not 
the 
latitude 
and 
extent 
of 
it. 
So 
that 
against 
atheists, 
the 
very 
savages 
take 
part, 
with 
the 
very 
subtlest 
philosophers. 
The 
contemplative 
atheist 
is 
rare: 
a 
Diagoras, 
a 
Bion, 
a 
Lucian 
perhaps, 
and 
some 
others; 
and 
yet 
they 
seem 
to 
be 
more 
than 
they 
are; 
for 
that 
all 
that 
impugn 
a 
received 
religion, 
or 
superstition, 
are 
by 
the 
adverse 
part 
branded 
with 
the 
name 
of 
atheists. 
But 
the 
great 
atheists, 
indeed 
are 
hypocrites; 
which 
are 
ever 
handling 
holy 
things, 
but 
without 
feeling; 
so 
as 
they 
must 
needs 
be 
cauterized 
in 
the 
end. 
The 
causes 
of 
atheism 
are: 
divisions 
in 
religion, 
if 
they 
be 
many; 
for 
any 
one 
main 
division, 
addeth 
zeal 
to 
both 
sides; 
but 
many 
divisions 
introduce 
atheism. 
Another 
is, 
scandal 
of 
priests; 
when 
it 
is 
come 
to 
that 
which 
St. 
Bernard 
saith, 
non 
est 
jam 
dicere, 
ut 
populus 
sic 
sacerdos; 
quia 
nec 
sic 
populus 
ut 
sacerdos. 
A 
third 
is, 
custom 
of 
profane 
scoffing 
in 
holy 
matters; 
which 
doth, 
by 
little 
and 
little, 
deface 
the 
reverence 
of 
religion. 
And 
lastly, 
learned 
times, 
specially 
with 
peace 
and 
prosperity; 
for 
troubles 
and 
adversities 
do 
more 
bow 
men’s 
minds 
to 
religion. 
They 
that 
deny 
a 
God, 
destroy 
man’s 
nobility; 
for 
certainly 
man 
is 
of 
kin 
to 
the 
beasts, 
by 
his 
body; 
and, 
if 
he 
be 
not 
of 
kin 
to 
God, 
by 
his 
spirit, 
he 
is 
a 
base 
and 
ignoble 
creature. 
It 
destroys 
likewise 
magnanimity, 
and 
the 
raising 
of 
human 
nature; 
for 
take 
an 
example 
of 
a 
dog, 
and 
mark 
what 
a 
generosity 
and 
courage 
he 
will 
put 
on, 
when 
he 
finds 
himself 
maintained 
by 
a 
man; 
who 
to 
him 
is 
instead 
of 
a 
God, 
or 
melior 
natura; 
which 
courage 
is 
manifestly 
such, 
as 
that 
creature, 
without 
that 
confidence 
of 
a 
better 
nature 
than 
his 
own, 
could 
never 
attain. 
So 
man, 
when 
he 
resteth 
and 
assureth 
himself, 
upon 
divine 
protection 
and 
favor, 
gathered 
a 
force 
and 
faith, 
which 
human 
nature 
in 
itself 
could 
not 
obtain. 
Therefore, 
as 
atheism 
is 
in 
all 
respects 
hateful, 
so 
in 
this, 
that 
it 
depriveth 
human 
nature 
of 
the 
means 
to 
exalt 
itself, 
above 
human 
frailty. 
As 
it 
is 
in 
particular 
persons, 
so 
it 
is 
in 
nations. 
Never 
was 
there 
such 
a 
state 
for 
magnanimity 
as 
Rome. 
Of 
this 
state 
hear 
what 
Cicero 
saith: 
Quam 
volumus 
licet, 
patres 
conscripti, 
nos 
amemus, 
tamen 
nec 
numero 
Hispanos, 
nec 
robore 
Gallos, 
nec 
calliditate 
Poenos, 
nec 
artibus 
Graecos, 
nec 
denique 
hoc 
ipso 
hujus 
gentis 
et 
terrae 
domestico 
nativoque 
sensu 
Italos 
ipsos 
et 
Latinos; 
sed 
pietate, 
ad 
religione, 
atque 
hac 
una 
sapientia, 
quod 
deorum 
immortalium 
numine 
omnia 
regi 
gubernarique 
perspeximus, 
omnes 
gentes 
nationesque 
superavimus. 



 
OF 
SUPERSTITION 


It 
were 
better 
to 
have 
no 
opinion 
of 
God 
at 
all, 
than 
such 
an 
opinion, 
as 
is 
unworthy 
of 
him. 
For 
the 
one 
is 
unbelief, 
the 
other 
is 
contumely; 
and 
certainly 
superstition 
is 
the 
reproach 
of 
the 
Deity. 
Plutarch 
saith 
well 
to 
that 
purpose: 
Surely 
(saith 
he) 
I 
had 
rather 
a 
great 
deal, 
men 
should 
say, 
there 
was 
no 
sitch 
man 
at 
all, 
as 
Plutarch, 
than 
that 
they 
should 
say, 
that 
there 
was 
one 
Plutarch, 
that 
would 
eat 
his 
children 
as 
soon 
as 
they 
were 
born; 
as 
the 
poets 
speak 
of 
Saturn. 
And 
as 
the 
contumely 
is 
greater 
towards 
God, 
so 
the 
danger 
is 
greater 
towards 
men. 
Atheism 
leaves 
a 
man 
to 
sense, 
to 
philosophy, 
to 
natural 
piety, 
to 
laws, 
to 
reputation 
all 
which 
may 
be 
guides 
to 
an 
outward 
moral 
virtue, 
though 
religion 
were 
not; 
but 
superstition 
dismounts 
all 
these, 
and 
erecteth 
an 
absolute 
monarchy, 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
men. 
Therefore 
theism 
did 
never 
perturb 
states; 
for 
it 
makes 
men 
wary 
of 
themselves, 
as 
looking 
no 
further: 
and 
we 
see 
the 
times 
inclined 
to 
atheism 
(as 
the 
time 
of 
Augustus 
Caesar) 
were 
civil 
times. 
But 
superstition 
hath 
been 
the 
confusion 
of 
many 
states, 
and 
bringeth 
in 
a 
new 
primum 
mobile, 
that 
ravisheth 
all 
the 
spheres 
of 
government. 
The 
master 
of 
superstition, 
is 
the 
people; 
and 
in 
all 
superstition, 
wise 
men 
follow 
fools; 
and 
arguments 
are 
fitted 
to 
practice, 
in 
a 
reversed 
order. 
It 
was 
gravely 
said 
by 
some 
of 
the 
prelates 
in 
the 
Council 
of 
Trent, 
where 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
Schoolmen 
bare 
great 
sway, 
that 
the 
Schoolmen 
were 
like 
astronomers, 
which 
did 
feign 
eccentrics 
and 
epicycles, 
and 
such 
engines 
of 
orbs, 
to 
save 
the 
phenomena; 
though 
they 
knew 
there 
were 
no 
such 
things; 
and 
in 
like 
manner, 
that 
the 
Schoolmen 
had 
framed 
a 
number 
of 
subtle 
and 
intricate 
axioms, 
and 
theorems, 
to 
save 
the 
practice 
of 
the 
church. 
The 
causes 
of 
superstition 
are: 
pleasing 
and 
sensual 
rites 
and 
ceremonies; 
excess 
of 
outward 
and 
pharisaical 
holiness; 
overgreat 
reverence 
of 
traditions, 
which 
cannot 
but 
load 
the 
church; 
the 
stratagems 
of 
prelates, 
for 
their 
own 
ambition 
and 
lucre; 
the 
favoring 
too 
much 
of 
good 
intentions, 
which 
openeth 
the 
gate 
to 
conceits 
and 
novelties; 
the 
taking 
an 
aim 
at 
divine 
matters, 
by 
human, 
which 
cannot 
but 
breed 
mixture 
of 
imaginations: 
and, 
lastly, 
barbarous 
times, 
especially 
joined 
with 
calamities 
and 
disasters. 
Superstition, 
without 
a 
veil, 
is 
a 
deformed 
thing; 
for, 
as 
it 
addeth 
deformity 
to 
an 
ape, 
to 
be 
so 
like 
a 
man, 
so 
the 
similitude 
of 
superstition 
to 
religion, 
makes 
it 
the 
more 



deformed. 
And 
as 
wholesome 
meat 
corrupteth 
to 
little 
worms, 
so 
good 
forms 
and 
orders 
corrupt, 
into 
a 
number 
of 
petty 
observances. 
There 
is 
a 
superstition 
in 
avoiding 
superstition, 
when 
men 
think 
to 
do 
best, 
if 
they 
go 
furthest 
from 
the 
superstition, 
formerly 
received; 
therefore 
care 
would 
be 
had 
that 
(as 
it 
fareth 
in 
the 
good 
be 
not 
taken 
away 
with 
the 
bad; 
which 
commonly 
is 
done, 
when 
the 
people 
is 
the 
reformer. 



OF 
TRAVEL 


Travel, 
in 
the 
younger 
sort, 
is 
a 
part 
of 
education, 
in 
the 
elder, 
a 
part 
of 
experience. 
He 
that 
travelleth 
into 
a 
country, 
before 
he 
hath 
some 
entrance 
into 
the 
language, 
goeth 
to 
school, 
and 
not 
to 
travel. 
That 
young 
men 
travel 
under 
some 
tutor, 
or 
grave 
servant, 
I 
allow 
well; 
so 
that 
he 
be 
such 
a 
one 
that 
hath 
the 
language, 
and 
hath 
been 
in 
the 
country 
before; 
whereby 
he 
may 
be 
able 
to 
tell 
them 
what 
things 
are 
worthy 
to 
be 
seen, 
in 
the 
country 
where 
they 
go; 
what 
acquaintances 
they 
are 
to 
seek; 
what 
exercises, 
or 
discipline, 
the 
place 
yieldeth. 
For 
else, 
young 
men 
shall 
go 
hooded, 
and 
look 
abroad 
little. 
It 
is 
a 
strange 
thing, 
that 
in 
sea 
voyages, 
where 
there 
is 
nothing 
to 
be 
seen, 
but 
sky 
and 
sea, 
men 
should 
make 
diaries; 
but 
in 
land-travel, 
wherein 
so 
much 
is 
to 
be 
observed, 
for 
the 
most 
part 
they 
omit 
it; 
as 
if 
chance 
were 
fitter 
to 
be 
registered, 
than 
observation. 
Let 
diaries, 
therefore, 
be 
brought 
in 
use. 
The 
things 
to 
be 
seen 
and 
observed 
are: 
the 
courts 
of 
princes, 
especially 
when 
they 
give 
audience 
to 
ambassadors; 
the 
courts 
of 
justice, 
while 
they 
sit 
and 
hear 
causes; 
and 
so 
of 
consistories 
ecclesiastic; 
the 
churches 
and 
monasteries, 
with 
the 
monuments 
which 
are 
therein 
extant; 
the 
walls 
and 
fortifications 
of 
cities, 
and 
towns, 
and 
so 
the 
heavens 
and 
harbors; 
antiquities 
and 
ruins; 
libraries; 
colleges, 
disputations, 
and 
lectures, 
where 
any 
are; 
shipping 
and 
navies; 
houses 
and 
gardens 
of 
state 
and 
pleasure, 
near 
great 
cities; 
armories; 
arsenals; 
magazines; 
exchanges; 
burses; 
warehouses; 
exercises 
of 
horsemanship, 
fencing, 
training 
of 
soldiers, 
and 
the 
like; 
comedies, 
such 
whereunto 
the 
better 
sort 
of 
persons 
do 
resort; 
treasuries 
of 
jewels 
and 
robes; 
cabinets 
and 
rarities; 
and, 
to 
conclude, 
whatsoever 
is 
memorable, 
in 
the 
places 
where 
they 
go. 
After 
all 
which, 
the 
tutors, 
or 
servants, 
ought 
to 
make 
diligent 
inquiry. 
As 
for 
triumphs, 
masks, 
feasts, 
weddings, 
funerals, 
capital 
executions, 
and 
such 
shows, 
men 
need 
not 
to 
be 
put 
in 
mind 
of 
them; 
yet 
are 
they 
not 
to 
be 
neglected. 
If 
you 
will 
have 
a 
young 
man 
to 
put 
his 
travel 
into 
a 
little 
room, 
and 
in 
short 
time 
to 
gather 
much, 
this 
you 
must 
do. 
First, 
as 
was 
said, 
he 
must 
have 
some 
entrance 
into 
the 
language 
before 
he 
goeth. 
Then 
he 
must 
have 
such 
a 
servant, 
or 
tutor, 
as 
knoweth 
the 
country, 
as 
was 
likewise 
said. 
Let 
him 
carry 
with 
him 
also, 
some 
card 
or 
book, 
describing 
the 
country 
where 
he 
travelleth; 
which 
will 
be 
a 
good 
key 
to 
his 
inquiry. 
Let 
him 
keep 



also 
a 
diary. 
Let 
him 
not 
stay 
long, 
in 
one 
city 
or 
town; 
more 
or 
less 
as 
the 
place 
deserveth, 
but 
not 
long; 
nay, 
when 
he 
stayeth 
in 
one 
city 
or 
town, 
let 
him 
change 
his 
lodging 
from 
one 
end 
and 
part 
of 
the 
town, 
to 
another; 
which 
is 
a 
great 
adamant 
of 
acquaintance. 
Let 
him 
sequester 
himself, 
from 
the 
company 
of 
his 
countrymen, 
and 
diet 
in 
such 
places, 
where 
there 
is 
good 
company 
of 
the 
nation 
where 
he 
travelleth. 
Let 
him, 
upon 
his 
removes 
from 
one 
place 
to 
another, 
procure 
recommendation 
to 
some 
person 
of 
quality, 
residing 
in 
the 
place 
whither 
he 
removeth; 
that 
he 
may 
use 
his 
favor, 
in 
those 
things 
he 
desireth 
to 
see 
or 
know. 
Thus 
he 
may 
abridge 
his 
travel, 
with 
much 
profit. 
As 
for 
the 
acquaintance, 
which 
is 
to 
be 
sought 
in 
travel; 
that 
which 
is 
most 
of 
all 
profitable, 
is 
acquaintance 
with 
the 
secretaries 
and 
employed 
men 
of 
ambassadors: 
for 
so 
in 
travelling 
in 
one 
country, 
he 
shall 
suck 
the 
experience 
of 
many. 
Let 
him 
also 
see, 
and 
visit, 
eminent 
persons 
in 
all 
kinds, 
which 
are 
of 
great 
name 
abroad; 
that 
he 
may 
be 
able 
to 
tell, 
how 
the 
life 
agreeth 
with 
the 
fame. 
For 
quarrels, 
they 
are 
with 
care 
and 
discretion 
to 
be 
avoided. 
They 
are 
commonly 
for 
mistresses, 
healths, 
place, 
and 
words. 
And 
let 
a 
man 
beware, 
how 
he 
keepeth 
company 
with 
choleric 
and 
quarrelsome 
persons; 
for 
they 
will 
engage 
him 
into 
their 
own 
quarrels. 
When 
a 
traveller 
returneth 
home, 
let 
him 
not 
leave 
the 
countries, 
where 
he 
hath 
travelled, 
altogether 
behind 
him; 
but 
maintain 
a 
correspondence 
by 
letters, 
with 
those 
of 
his 
acquaintance. 
which 
are 
of 
most 
worth. 
And 
let 
his 
travel 
appear 
rather 
in 
his 
discourse, 
than 
his 
apparel 
or 
gesture; 
and 
in 
his 
discourse, 
let 
him 
be 
rather 
advised 
in 
his 
answers, 
than 
forward 
to 
tell 
stories; 
and 
let 
it 
appear 
that 
he 
doth 
not 
change 
his 
country 
manners, 
for 
those 
of 
foreign 
parts; 
but 
only 
prick 
in 
some 
flowers, 
of 
that 
he 
hath 
learned 
abroad, 
into 
the 
customs 
of 
his 
own 
country. 



OF 
EMPIRE 


It 
is 
a 
miserable 
state 
of 
mind, 
to 
have 
few 
things 
to 
desire, 
and 
many 
things 
to 
fear; 
and 
yet 
that 
commonly 
is 
the 
case 
of 
kings; 
who, 
being 
at 
the 
highest, 
want 
matter 
of 
desire, 
which 
makes 
their 
minds 
more 
languishing; 
and 
have 
many 
representations 
of 
perils 
and 
shadows, 
which 
makes 
their 
minds 
the 
less 
clear. 
And 
this 
is 
one 
reason 
also, 
of 
that 
effect 
which 
the 
Scripture 
speaketh 
of, 
That 
the 
king’s 
heart 
is 
inscrutable. 
For 
multitude 
of 
jealousies, 
and 
lack 
of 
some 
predominant 
desire, 
that 
should 
marshal 
and 
put 
in 
order 
all 
the 
rest, 
maketh 
any 
man’s 
heart, 
hard 
to 
find 
or 
sound. 
Hence 
it 
comes 
likewise, 
that 
princes 
many 
times 
make 
themselves 
desires, 
and 
set 
their 
hearts 
upon 
toys; 
sometimes 
upon 
a 
building; 
sometimes 
upon 
erecting 
of 
an 
order; 
sometimes 
upon 
the 
advancing 
of 
a 
person; 
sometimes 
upon 
obtaining 
excellency 
in 
some 
art, 
or 
feat 
of 
the 
hand; 
as 
Nero 
for 
playing 
on 
the 
harp, 
Domitian 
for 
certainty 
of 
the 
hand 
with 
the 
arrow, 
Commodus 
for 
playing 
at 
fence, 
Caracalla 
for 
driving 
chariots, 
and 
the 
like. 
This 
seemeth 
incredible, 
unto 
those 
that 
know 
not 
the 
principle, 
that 
the 
mind 
of 
man, 
is 
more 
cheered 
and 
refreshed 
by 
profiting 
in 
small 
things, 
than 
by 
standing 
at 
a 
stay, 
in 
great. 
We 
see 
also 
that 
kings 
that 
have 
been 
fortunate 
conquerors, 
in 
their 
first 
years, 
it 
being 
not 
possible 
for 
them 
to 
go 
forward 
infinitely, 
but 
that 
they 
must 
have 
some 
check, 
or 
arrest 
in 
their 
fortunes, 
turn 
in 
their 
latter 
years 
to 
be 
superstitious, 
and 
melancholy; 
as 
did 
Alexander 
the 
Great; 
Diocletian; 
and 
in 
our 
memory, 
Charles 
the 
Fifth; 
and 
others: 
for 
he 
that 
is 
used 
to 
go 
forward, 
and 
findeth 
a 
stop, 
falleth 
out 
of 
his 
own 
favor, 
and 
is 
not 
the 
thing 
he 
was. 


To 
speak 
now 
of 
the 
true 
temper 
of 
empire, 
it 
is 
a 
thing 
rare 
and 
hard 
to 
keep; 
for 
both 
temper, 
and 
distemper, 
consist 
of 
contraries. 
But 
it 
is 
one 
thing, 
to 
mingle 
contraries, 
another 
to 
interchange 
them. 
The 
answer 
of 
Apollonius 
to 
Vespasian, 
is 
full 
of 
excellent 
instruction. 
Vespasian 
asked 
him, 
What 
was 
Nero’s 
overthrow? 
He 
answered, 
Nero 
could 
touch 
and 
tune 
the 
harp 
well; 
but 
in 
government, 
sometimes 
he 
used 
to 
wind 
the 
pins 
too 
high, 
sometimes 
to 
let 
them 
down 
too 
low. 
And 
certain 
it 
is, 
that 
nothing 
destroyeth 
authority 
so 
much, 
as 
the 
unequal 
and 
untimely 
interchange 
of 



power 
pressed 
too 
far, 
and 
relaxed 
too 
much. 


This 
is 
true, 
that 
the 
wisdom 
of 
all 
these 
latter 
times, 
in 
princes’ 
affairs, 
is 
rather 
fine 
deliveries, 
and 
shiftings 
of 
dangers 
and 
mischiefs, 
when 
they 
are 
near, 
than 
solid 
and 
grounded 
courses 
to 
keep 
them 
aloof. 
But 
this 
is 
but 
to 
try 
masteries 
with 
fortune. 
And 
let 
men 
beware, 
how 
they 
neglect 
and 
suffer 
matter 
of 
trouble 
to 
be 
prepared 
for 
no 
man 
can 
forbid 
the 
spark, 
nor 
tell 
whence 
it 
may 
come. 
The 
difficulties 
in 
princes’ 
business 
are 
many 
and 
great; 
but 
the 
greatest 
difficulty, 
is 
often 
in 
their 
own 
mind. 
For 
it 
is 
common 
with 
princes 
(saith 
Tacitus) 
to 
will 
contradictories, 
Sunt 
plerumque 
regum 
voluntates 
vehementes, 
et 
inter 
se 
contrariae. 
For 
it 
is 
the 
solecism 
of 
power, 
to 
think 
to 
command 
the 
end, 
and 
yet 
not 
to 
endure 
the 
mean. 


Kings 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
their 
neighbors, 
their 
wives, 
their 
children, 
their 
prelates 
or 
clergy, 
their 
nobles, 
their 
second-nobles 
or 
gentlemen, 
their 
merchants, 
their 
commons, 
and 
their 
men 
of 
war; 
and 
from 
all 
these 
arise 
dangers, 
if 
care 
and 
circumspection 
be 
not 
used. 


First 
for 
their 
neighbors; 
there 
can 
no 
general 
rule 
be 
given 
(for 
occasions 
are 
so 
variable), 
save 
one, 
which 
ever 
holdeth, 
which 
is, 
that 
princes 
do 
keep 
due 
sentinel, 
that 
none 
of 
their 
neighbors 
do 
ever 
grow 
so 
(by 
increase 
of 
territory, 
by 
embracing 
of 
trade, 
by 
approaches, 
or 
the 
like), 
as 
they 
become 
more 
able 
to 
annoy 
them, 
than 
they 
were. 
And 
this 
is 
generally 
the 
work 
of 
standing 
counsels, 
to 
foresee 
and 
to 
hinder 
it. 
During 
that 
triumvirate 
of 
kings, 
King 
Henry 
the 
Eighth 
of 
England, 
Francis 
the 
First 
King 
of 
France, 
and 
Charles 
the 
Fifth 
Emperor, 
there 
was 
such 
a 
watch 
kept, 
that 
none 
of 
the 
three 
could 
win 
a 
palm 
of 
ground, 
but 
the 
other 
two 
would 
straightways 
balance 
it, 
either 
by 
confederation, 
or, 
if 
need 
were, 
by 
a 
war; 
and 
would 
not 
in 
any 
wise 
take 
up 
peace 
at 
interest. 
And 
the 
like 
was 
done 
by 
that 
league 
(which 
Guicciardini 
saith 
was 
the 
security 
of 
Italy) 
made 
between 
Ferdinando 
King 
of 
Naples, 
Lorenzius 
Medici, 
and 
Ludovicus 
Sforza, 
potentates, 
the 
one 
of 
Florence, 
the 
other 
of 
Milan. 
Neither 
is 
the 
opinion 
of 
some 
of 
the 
Schoolmen, 
to 
be 
received, 
that 
a 
war 
cannot 
justly 
be 
made, 
but 
upon 
a 
precedent 
injury, 
or 
provocation. 
For 
there 
is 
no 
question, 
but 
a 
just 
fear 
of 
an 
imminent 
danger, 
though 
there 
be 
no 
blow 
given, 
is 
a 
lawful 
cause 
of 
a 
war. 


For 
their 
wives; 
there 
are 
cruel 
examples 
of 
them. 
Livia 
is 
infamed, 
for 
the 
poisoning 
of 
her 
husband; 
Roxalana, 
Solyman’s 
wife, 
was 
the 



destruction 
of 
that 
renowned 
prince, 
Sultan 
Mustapha, 
and 
otherwise 
troubled 
his 
house 
and 
succession; 
Edward 
the 
Second 
of 
England, 
his 
queen, 
had 
the 
principal 
hand 
in 
the 
deposing 
and 
murder 
of 
her 
husband. 
This 
kind 
of 
danger, 
is 
then 
to 
be 
feared 
chiefly, 
when 
the 
wives 
have 
plots, 
for 
the 
raising 
of 
their 
own 
children; 
or 
else 
that 
they 
be 
advoutresses. 


For 
their 
children; 
the 
tragedies 
likewise 
of 
dangers 
from 
them, 
have 
been 
many. 
And 
generally, 
the 
entering 
of 
fathers 
into 
suspicion 
of 
their 
children, 
hath 
been 
ever 
unfortunate. 
The 
destruction 
of 
Mustapha 
(that 
we 
named 
before) 
was 
so 
fatal 
to 
Solyman’s 
line, 
as 
the 
succession 
of 
the 
Turks, 
from 
Solyman 
until 
this 
day, 
is 
suspected 
to 
be 
untrue, 
and 
of 
strange 
blood; 
for 
that 
Selymus 
the 
Second, 
was 
thought 
to 
be 
suppositious. 
The 
destruction 
of 
Crispus, 
a 
young 
prince 
of 
rare 
towardness, 
by 
Constantinus 
the 
Great, 
his 
father, 
was 
in 
like 
manner 
fatal 
to 
his 
house; 
for 
both 
Constantinus 
and 
Constance, 
his 
sons, 
died 
violent 
deaths; 
and 
Constantius, 
his 
other 
son, 
did 
little 
better; 
who 
died 
indeed 
of 
sickness, 
but 
after 
that 
Julianus 
had 
taken 
arms 
against 
him. 
The 
destruction 
of 
Demetrius, 
son 
to 
Philip 
the 
Second 
of 
Macedon, 
turned 
upon 
the 
father, 
who 
died 
of 
repentance. 
And 
many 
like 
examples 
there 
are; 
but 
few 
or 
none, 
where 
the 
fathers 
had 
good 
by 
such 
distrust; 
except 
it 
were, 
where 
the 
sons 
were 
up 
in 
open 
arms 
against 
them; 
as 
was 
Selymus 
the 
First 
against 
Bajazet; 
and 
the 
three 
sons 
of 
Henry 
the 
Second, 
King 
of 
England. 


For 
their 
prelates; 
when 
they 
are 
proud 
and 
great, 
there 
is 
also 
danger 
from 
them; 
as 
it 
was 
in 
the 
times 
of 
Anselmus, 
and 
Thomas 
Becket, 
Archbishops 
of 
Canterbury; 
who, 
with 
their 
croziers, 
did 
almost 
try 
it 
with 
the 
king’s 
sword; 
and 
yet 
they 
had 
to 
deal 
with 
stout 
and 
haughty 
kings, 
William 
Rufus, 
Henry 
the 
First, 
and 
Henry 
the 
Second. 
The 
danger 
is 
not 
from 
that 
state, 
but 
where 
it 
hath 
a 
dependence 
of 
foreign 
authority; 
or 
where 
the 
churchmen 
come 
in 
and 
are 
elected, 
not 
by 
the 
collation 
of 
the 
king, 
or 
particular 
patrons, 
but 
by 
the 
people. 


For 
their 
nobles; 
to 
keep 
them 
at 
a 
distance, 
it 
is 
not 
amiss; 
but 
to 
depress 
them, 
may 
make 
a 
king 
more 
absolute, 
but 
less 
safe; 
and 
less 
able 
to 
perform, 
any 
thing 
that 
he 
desires. 
I 
have 
noted 
it, 
in 
my 
History 
of 
King 
Henry 
the 
Seventh 
of 
England, 
who 
depressed 
his 
nobility; 
whereupon 
it 
came 
to 
pass, 
that 
his 
times 
were 
full 
of 
difficidties 
and 
troubles; 
for 
the 
nobility, 
though 
they 
continued 
loyal 
unto 
him, 
yet 
did 
they 
not 
co-operate 
with 
him 
in 
his 
business. 
So 
that 
in 
effect, 
he 
was 
fain 
to 
do 
all 
things 



himself. 


For 
their 
second-nobles; 
there 
is 
not 
much 
danger 
from 
them, 
being 
a 
body 
dispersed. 
They 
may 
sometimes 
discourse 
high, 
but 
that 
doth 
little 
hurt; 
besides, 
they 
are 
a 
counterpoise 
to 
the 
higher 
nobility, 
that 
they 
grow 
not 
too 
potent; 
and, 
lastly, 
being 
the 
most 
immediate 
in 
authority, 
with 
the 
common 
people, 
they 
do 
best 
temper 
popular 
commotions. 


For 
their 
merchants; 
they 
are 
vena 
porta; 
and 
if 
they 
flourish 
not, 
a 
kingdom 
may 
have 
good 
limbs, 
but 
will 
have 
empty 
veins, 
and 
nourish 
little. 
Taxes 
and 
imposts 
upon 
them, 
do 
seldom 
good 
to 
the 
king’s 
revenue; 
for 
that 
that 
wins 
in 
the 
hundred, 
he 
leeseth 
in 
the 
shire; 
the 
particular 
rates 
being 
increased, 
but 
the 
total 
bulk 
of 
trading, 
rather 
decreased. 


For 
their 
commons; 
there 
is 
little 
danger 
from 
them, 
except 
it 
be, 
where 
they 
have 
great 
and 
potent 
heads; 
or 
where 
you 
meddle 
with 
the 
point 
of 
religion, 
or 
their 
customs, 
or 
means 
of 
life. 


For 
their 
men 
of 
war; 
it 
is 
a 
dangerous 
state, 
where 
they 
live 
and 
remain 
in 
a 
body, 
and 
are 
used 
to 
donatives; 
whereof 
we 
see 
examples 
in 
the 
janizaries, 
and 
pretorian 
bands 
of 
Rome; 
but 
trainings 
of 
men, 
and 
arming 
them 
in 
several 
places, 
and 
under 
several 
commanders, 
and 
without 
donatives, 
are 
things 
of 
defence, 
and 
no 
danger. 


Princes 
are 
like 
to 
heavenly 
bodies, 
which 
cause 
good 
or 
evil 
times; 
and 
which 
have 
much 
veneration, 
but 
no 
rest. 
All 
precepts 
concerning 
kings, 
are 
in 
effect 
comprehended 
in 
those 
two 
remembrances: 
memento 
quod 
es 
homo; 
and 
memento 
quod 
es 
Deus, 
or 
vice 
Dei; 
the 
one 
bridleth 
their 
power, 
and 
the 
other 
their 
will. 



OF 
COUNSEL 


The 
greatest 
trust, 
between 
man 
and 
man, 
is 
the 
trust 
of 
giving 
counsel. 
For 
in 
other 
confidences, 
men 
commit 
the 
parts 
of 
life; 
their 
lands, 
their 
goods, 
their 
children, 
their 
credit, 
some 
particular 
affair; 
but 
to 
such 
as 
they 
make 
their 
counsellors, 
they 
commit 
the 
whole: 
by 
how 
much 
the 
more, 
they 
are 
obliged 
to 
all 
faith 
and 
integrity. 
The 
wisest 
princes 
need 
not 
think 
it 
any 
diminution 
to 
their 
greatness, 
or 
derogation 
to 
their 
sufficiency, 
to 
rely 
upon 
counsel. 
God 
himself 
is 
not 
without, 
but 
hath 
made 
it 
one 
of 
the 
great 
names 
of 
his 
blessed 
Son: 
The 
Counsellor. 
Solomon 
hath 
pronounced, 
that 
in 
counsel 
is 
stability. 
Things 
will 
have 
their 
first, 
or 
second 
agitation: 
if 
they 
be 
not 
tossed 
upon 
the 
arguments 
of 
counsel, 
they 
will 
be 
tossed 
upon 
the 
waves 
of 
fortune; 
and 
be 
full 
of 
inconstancy, 
doing 
and 
undoing, 
like 
the 
reeling 
of 
a 
drunken 
man. 
Solomon’s 
son 
found 
the 
force 
of 
counsel, 
as 
his 
father 
saw 
the 
necessity 
of 
it. 
For 
the 
beloved 
kingdom 
of 
God, 
was 
first 
rent, 
and 
broken, 
by 
ill 
counsel; 
upon 
which 
counsel, 
there 
are 
set 
for 
our 
instruction, 
the 
two 
marks 
whereby 
bad 
counsel 
is 
for 
ever 
best 
discerned; 
that 
it 
was 
young 
counsel, 
for 
the 
person; 
and 
violent 
counsel, 
for 
the 
matter. 


The 
ancient 
times, 
do 
set 
forth 
in 
figure, 
both 
the 
incorporation, 
and 
inseparable 
conjunction, 
of 
counsel 
with 
kings, 
and 
the 
wise 
and 
politic 
use 
of 
counsel 
by 
kings: 
the 
one, 
in 
that 
they 
say 
Jupiter 
did 
marry 
Metis, 
which 
signifieth 
counsel; 
whereby 
they 
intend 
that 
Sovereignty, 
is 
manied 
to 
Counsel: 
the 
other 
in 
that 
which 
followeth, 
which 
was 
thus: 
They 
say, 
after 
Jupiter 
was 
married 
to 
Metis, 
she 
conceived 
by 
him, 
and 
was 
with 
child, 
but 
Jupiter 
suffered 
her 
not 
to 
stay, 
till 
she 
brought 
forth, 
but 
eat 
her 
up; 
whereby 
he 
became 
himself 
with 
child, 
and 
was 
delivered 
of 
Pallas 
armed, 
out 
of 
his 
head. 
Which 
monstrous 
fable 
containeth 
a 
secret 
of 
empire; 
how 
kings 
are 
to 
make 
use 
of 
their 
counsel 
of 
state. 
That 
first, 
they 
ought 
to 
refer 
matters 
unto 
them, 
which 
is 
the 
first 
begetting, 
or 
impregnation; 
but 
when 
they 
are 
elaborate, 
moulded, 
and 
shaped 
in 
the 
womb 
of 
their 
counsel, 
and 
grow 
ripe, 
and 
ready 
to 
be 
brought 
forth, 
that 
then 
they 
suffer 
not 
their 
counsel, 
to 
go 
through 
with 
the 
resolution 
and 
direction, 
as 
if 
it 
depended 
on 
them; 
but 
take 
the 
matter 
back 
into 
their 
own 
hands, 
and 
make 
it 
appear 
to 
the 
world, 
that 
the 
decrees 
and 
final 
directions 
(which, 
because 
they 
come 
forth, 
with 
prudence 
and 
power, 
are 
resembled 
to 
Pallas 
armed) 
proceeded 
from 



themselves; 
and 
not 
only 
from 
their 
authority, 
but 
(the 
more 
to 
add 
reputation 
to 
themselves) 
from 
their 
head 
and 
device. 


Let 
us 
now 
speak 
of 
the 
inconveniences 
of 
counsel, 
and 
of 
the 
remedies. 
The 
inconveniences 
that 
have 
been 
noted, 
in 
calling 
and 
using 
counsel, 
are 
three. 
First, 
the 
revealing 
of 
affairs, 
whereby 
they 
become 
less 
secret. 
Secondly, 
the 
weakening 
of 
the 
authority 
of 
princes, 
as 
if 
they 
were 
less 
of 
themselves. 
Thirdly, 
the 
danger 
of 
being 
unfaithfully 
counselled, 
and 
more 
for 
the 
good 
of 
them 
that 
counsel, 
than 
of 
him 
that 
is 
counselled. 
For 
which 
inconveniences, 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Italy, 
and 
practice 
of 
France, 
in 
some 
kings’ 
times, 
hath 
introduced 
cabinet 
counsels; 
a 
remedy 
worse 
than 
the 
disease. 


As 
to 
secrecy; 
princes 
are 
not 
bound 
to 
communicate 
all 
matters, 
with 
all 
counsellors; 
but 
may 
extract 
and 
select. 
Neither 
is 
it 
necessary, 
that 
he 
that 
consulteth 
what 
he 
should 
do, 
should 
declare 
what 
he 
will 
do. 
But 
let 
princes 
beware, 
that 
the 
unsecreting 
of 
their 
affairs, 
comes 
not 
from 
themselves. 
And 
as 
for 
cabinet 
counsels, 
it 
may 
be 
their 
motto, 
plenus 
rimarum 
sum: 
one 
futile 
person, 
that 
maketh 
it 
his 
glory 
to 
tell, 
will 
do 
more 
hurt 
than 
many, 
that 
know 
it 
their 
duty 
to 
conceal. 
It 
is 
true 
there 
be 
some 
affairs, 
which 
require 
extreme 
secrecy, 
which 
will 
hardly 
go 
beyond 
one 
or 
two 
persons, 
besides 
the 
king: 
neither 
are 
those 
counsels 
unprosperous; 
for, 
besides 
the 
secrecy, 
they 
commonly 
go 
on 
constantly, 
in 
one 
spirit 
of 
direction, 
without 
distraction. 
But 
then 
it 
must 
be 
a 
prudent 
king, 
such 
as 
is 
able 
to 
grind 
with 
a 
handmill; 
and 
those 
inward 
counsellors 
had 
need 
also 
be 
wise 
men, 
and 
especially 
true 
and 
trusty 
to 
the 
king’s 
ends; 
as 
it 
was 
with 
King 
Henry 
the 
Seventh 
of 
England, 
who, 
in 
his 
great 
business, 
imparted 
himself 
to 
none, 
except 
it 
were 
to 
Morton 
and 
Fox. 


For 
weakening 
of 
authority; 
the 
fable 
showeth 
the 
remedy. 
Nay, 
the 
majesty 
of 
kings, 
is 
rather 
exalted 
than 
diminished, 
when 
they 
are 
in 
the 
chair 
of 
counsel; 
neither 
was 
there 
ever 
prince, 
bereaved 
of 
his 
dependences, 
by 
his 
counsel, 
except 
where 
there 
hath 
been, 
either 
an 
over-greatness 
in 
one 
counsellor, 
or 
an 
over-strict 
combination 
in 
divers; 
which 
are 
things 
soon 
found, 
and 
holpen. 


For 
the 
last 
inconvenience, 
that 
men 
will 
counsel, 
with 
an 
eye 
to 
themselves; 
certainly, 
non 
inveniet 
fidem 
super 
terram 
is 
meant, 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
times, 
and 
not 
of 
all 
particular 
persons. 
There 
be, 
that 
are 
in 
nature 
faithful, 



and 
sincere, 
and 
plain, 
and 
direct; 
not 
crafty 
and 
involved; 
let 
princes, 
above 
all, 
draw 
to 
themselves 
such 
natures. 
Besides, 
counsellors 
are 
not 
commonly 
so 
united, 
but 
that 
one 
counsellor, 
keepeth 
sentinel 
over 
another; 
so 
that 
if 
any 
do 
counsel 
out 
of 
faction 
or 
private 
ends, 
it 
commonly 
comes 
to 
the 
king’s 
ear. 
But 
the 
best 
remedy 
is, 
if 
princes 
know 
their 
counsellors, 
as 
well 
as 
their 
counsellors 
know 
them: 


Principis 
est 
virtus 
maxima 
nosse 
suos. 


And 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
counsellors 
should 
not 
be 
too 
speculative 
into 
their 
sovereign’s 
person. 
The 
true 
composition 
of 
a 
counsellor, 
is 
rather 
to 
be 
skilful 
in 
their 
master’s 
business 
than 
in 
his 
nature; 
for 
then 
he 
is 
like 
to 
advise 
him, 
and 
not 
feed 
his 
humor. 
It 
is 
of 
singular 
use 
to 
princes, 
if 
they 
take 
the 
opinions 
of 
their 
counsel, 
both 
separately 
and 
together. 
For 
private 
opinion 
is 
more 
free; 
but 
opinion 
before 
others, 
is 
more 
reverent. 
In 
private, 
men 
are 
more 
bold 
in 
their 
own 
humors; 
and 
in 
consort, 
men 
are 
more 
obnoxious 
to 
others’ 
humors; 
therefore 
it 
is 
good 
to 
take 
both; 
and 
of 
the 
inferior 
sort, 
rather 
in 
private, 
to 
preserve 
freedom; 
of 
the 
greater, 
rather 
in 
consort, 
to 
preserve 
respect. 
It 
is 
in 
vain 
for 
princes, 
to 
take 
counsel 
concerning 
matters, 
if 
they 
take 
no 
counsel 
likewise 
concerning 
persons; 
for 
all 
matters 
are 
as 
dead 
images; 
and 
the 
life 
of 
the 
execution 
of 
affairs, 
resteth 
in 
the 
good 
choice 
of 
persons. 
Neither 
is 
it 
enough, 
to 
consult 
concerning 
persons 
secundum 
genera, 
as 
in 
an 
idea, 
or 
mathematical 
description, 
what 
the 
kind 
and 
character 
of 
the 
person 
should 
be; 
for 
the 
greatest 
errors 
are 
committed, 
and 
the 
most 
judgment 
is 
shown, 
in 
the 
choice 
of 
individuals. 
It 
was 
truly 
said, 
optimi 
consiliarii 
mortui: 
books 
will 
speak 
plain, 
when 
counsellors 
blanch. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
good 
to 
be 
conversant 
in 
them, 
specially 
the 
books 
of 
such 
as 
themselves 
have 
been 
actors 
upon 
the 
stage. 


The 
counsels 
at 
this 
day, 
in 
most 
places, 
are 
but 
familiar 
meetings, 
where 
matters 
are 
rather 
talked 
on, 
than 
debated. 
And 
they 
run 
too 
swift, 
to 
the 
order, 
or 
act, 
of 
counsel. 
It 
were 
better 
that 
in 
causes 
of 
weight, 
the 
matter 
were 
propounded 
one 
day, 
and 
not 
spoken 
to 
till 
the 
next 
day; 
in 
nocte 
consilium. 
So 
was 
it 
done 
in 
the 
Commission 
of 
Union, 
between 
England 
and 
Scotland; 
which 
was 
a 
grave 
and 
orderly 
assembly. 
I 
commend 
set 
days 
for 
petitions; 
for 
both 
it 
gives 
the 
suitors 
more 
certainty 
for 
their 
attendance, 
and 
it 
frees 
the 
meetings 
for 
matters 
of 
estate, 
that 
they 
may 
hoc 
agere. 
In 
choice 
of 
committees; 
for 
ripening 
business 
for 
the 
counsel, 
it 
is 
better 
to 
choose 



indifferent 
persons, 
than 
to 
make 
an 
indifferency, 
by 
putting 
in 
those, 
that 
are 
strong 
on 
both 
sides. 
I 
commend 
also 
standing 
commissions; 
as 
for 
trade, 
for 
treasure, 
for 
war, 
for 
suits, 
for 
some 
provinces; 
for 
where 
there 
be 
divers 
particular 
counsels, 
and 
but 
one 
counsel 
of 
estate 
(as 
it 
is 
in 
Spain), 
they 
are, 
in 
effect, 
no 
more 
than 
standing 
commissions: 
save 
that 
they 
have 
greater 
authority. 
Let 
such 
as 
are 
to 
inform 
counsels, 
out 
of 
their 
particular 
professions 
(as 
lawyers, 
seamen, 
mintmen, 
and 
the 
like) 
be 
first 
heard 
before 
committees; 
and 
then, 
as 
occasion 
serves, 
before 
the 
counsel. 
And 
let 
them 
not 
come 
in 
multitudes, 
or 
in 
a 
tribunitious 
manner; 
for 
that 
is 
to 
clamor 
counsels, 
not 
to 
inform 
them. 
A 
long 
table 
and 
a 
square 
table, 
or 
seats 
about 
the 
walls, 
seem 
things 
of 
form, 
but 
are 
things 
of 
substance; 
for 
at 
a 
long 
table 
a 
few 
at 
the 
upper 
end, 
in 
effect, 
sway 
all 
the 
business; 
but 
in 
the 
other 
form, 
there 
is 
more 
use 
of 
the 
counsellors’ 
opinions, 
that 
sit 
lower. 
A 
king, 
when 
he 
presides 
in 
counsel, 
let 
him 
beware 
how 
he 
opens 
his 
own 
inclination 
too 
much, 
in 
that 
which 
he 
propoundeth; 
for 
else 
counsellors 
will 
but 
take 
the 
wind 
of 
him, 
and 
instead 
of 
giving 
free 
counsel, 
sing 
him 
a 
song 
of 
placebo. 



OF 
DELAYS 


Fortune 
is 
like 
the 
market; 
where 
many 
times 
if 
you 
can 
stay 
a 
little, 
the 
price 
will 
fall. 
Again, 
it 
is 
sometimes 
like 
Sibylla’s 
offer; 
which 
at 
first, 
offereth 
the 
commodity 
at 
full, 
then 
consumeth 
part 
and 
part, 
and 
still 
holdeth 
up 
the 
price. 
For 
occasion 
(as 
it 
is 
in 
the 
common 
verse) 
turneth 
a 
bald 
noddle, 
after 
she 
hath 
presented 
her 
locks 
in 
front, 
and 
no 
hold 
taken 
or 
at 
least 
turneth 
the 
handle 
of 
the 
bottle, 
first 
to 
be 
received, 
and 
after 
the 
belly, 
which 
is 
hard 
to 
clasp. 
There 
is 
surely 
no 
greater 
wisdom, 
than 
well 
to 
time 
the 
beginnings, 
and 
onsets, 
of 
things. 
Dangers 
are 
no 
more 
light, 
if 
they 
once 
seem 
light; 
and 
more 
dangers 
have 
deceived 
men, 
than 
forced 
them. 
Nay, 
it 
were 
better, 
to 
meet 
some 
dangers 
half 
way, 
though 
they 
come 
nothing 
near, 
than 
to 
keep 
too 
long 
a 
watch 
upon 
their 
approaches; 
for 
if 
a 
man 
watch 
too 
long, 
it 
is 
odds 
he 
will 
fall 
asleep. 
On 
the 
other 
side, 
to 
be 
deceived 
with 
too 
long 
shadows 
(as 
some 
have 
been, 
when 
the 
moon 
was 
low, 
and 
shone 
on 
their 
enemies’ 
back), 
and 
so 
to 
shoot 
off 
before 
the 
time; 
or 
to 
teach 
dangers 
to 
come 
on, 
by 
over 
early 
buckling 
towards 
them; 
is 
another 
extreme. 
The 
ripeness, 
or 
unripeness, 
of 
the 
occasion 
(as 
we 
said) 
must 
ever 
be 
well 
weighed; 
and 
generally 
it 
is 
good, 
to 
commit 
the 
beginnings 
of 
an 
great 
actions 
to 
Argus, 
with 
his 
hundred 
eyes, 
and 
the 
ends 
to 
Briareus, 
with 
his 
hundred 
hands; 
first 
to 
watch, 
and 
then 
to 
speed. 
For 
the 
helmet 
of 
Pluto, 
which 
maketh 
the 
politic 
man 
go 
invisible, 
is 
secrecy 
in 
the 
counsel, 
and 
celerity 
in 
the 
execution. 
For 
when 
things 
are 
once 
come 
to 
the 
execution, 
there 
is 
no 
secrecy, 
comparable 
to 
celerity; 
like 
the 
motion 
of 
a 
bullet 
in 
the 
air, 
which 
flieth 
so 
swift, 
as 
it 
outruns 
the 
eye. 



OF 
CUNNING 


We 
take 
cunning 
for 
a 
sinister 
or 
crooked 
wisdom. 
And 
certainly 
there 
is 
a 
great 
difference, 
between 
a 
cunning 
man, 
and 
a 
wise 
man; 
not 
only 
in 
point 
of 
honesty, 
but 
in 
point 
of 
ability. 
There 
be, 
that 
can 
pack 
the 
cards, 
and 
yet 
cannot 
play 
well; 
so 
there 
are 
some 
that 
are 
good 
in 
canvasses 
and 
factions, 
that 
are 
otherwise 
weak 
men. 
Again, 
it 
is 
one 
thing 
to 
understand 
persons, 
and 
another 
thing 
to 
understand 
matters; 
for 
many 
are 
perfect 
in 
men’s 
humors, 
that 
are 
not 
greatly 
capable 
of 
the 
real 
part 
of 
business; 
which 
is 
the 
constitution 
of 
one 
that 
hath 
studied 
men, 
more 
than 
books. 
Such 
men 
are 
fitter 
for 
practice, 
than 
for 
counsel; 
and 
they 
are 
good, 
but 
in 
their 
own 
alley: 
turn 
them 
to 
new 
men, 
and 
they 
have 
lost 
their 
aim; 
so 
as 
the 
old 
rule, 
to 
know 
a 
fool 
from 
a 
wise 
man, 
Mitte 
ambos 
nudos 
ad 
ignotos, 
et 
videbis, 
doth 
scarce 
hold 
for 
them. 
And 
because 
these 
cunning 
men, 
are 
like 
haberdashers 
of 
small 
wares, 
it 
is 
not 
amiss 
to 
set 
forth 
their 
shop. 


It 
is 
a 
point 
of 
cunning, 
to 
wait 
upon 
him 
with 
whom 
you 
speak, 
with 
your 
eye; 
as 
the 
Jesuits 
give 
it 
in 
precept: 
for 
there 
be 
many 
wise 
men, 
that 
have 
secret 
hearts, 
and 
transparent 
countenances. 
Yet 
this 
would 
be 
done 
with 
a 
demure 
abasing 
of 
your 
eye, 
sometimes, 
as 
the 
Jesuits 
also 
do 
use. 


Another 
is, 
that 
when 
you 
have 
anything 
to 
obtain, 
of 
present 
despatch, 
you 
entertain 
and 
amuse 
the 
party, 
with 
whom 
you 
deal, 
with 
some 
other 
discourse; 
that 
he 
be 
not 
too 
much 
awake 
to 
make 
objections. 
I 
knew 
a 
counsellor 
and 
secretary, 
that 
never 
came 
to 
Queen 
Elizabeth 
of 
England, 
with 
bills 
to 
sign, 
but 
he 
would 
always 
first 
put 
her 
into 
some 
discourse 
of 
estate, 
that 
she 
mought 
the 
less 
mind 
the 
bills. 


The 
like 
surprise 
may 
be 
made 
by 
moving 
things, 
when 
the 
party 
is 
in 
haste, 
and 
cannot 
stay 
to 
consider 
advisedly 
of 
that 
is 
moved. 


If 
a 
man 
would 
cross 
a 
business, 
that 
he 
doubts 
some 
other 
would 
handsomely 
and 
effectually 
move, 
let 
him 
pretend 
to 
wish 
it 
well, 
and 
move 
it 
himself 
in 
such 
sort 
as 
may 
foil 
it. 


The 
breaking 
off, 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
that 
one 
was 
about 
to 
say, 
as 
if 
he 
took 
himself 
up, 
breeds 
a 
greater 
appetite 
in 
him 
with 
whom 
you 
confer, 
to 



know 
more. 


And 
because 
it 
works 
better, 
when 
anything 
seemeth 
to 
be 
gotten 
from 
you 
by 
question, 
than 
if 
you 
offer 
it 
of 
yourself, 
you 
may 
lay 
a 
bait 
for 
a 
question, 
by 
showing 
another 
visage, 
and 
countenance, 
than 
you 
are 
wont; 
to 
the 
end 
to 
give 
occasion, 
for 
the 
party 
to 
ask, 
what 
the 
matter 
is 
of 
the 
change? 
As 
Nehemias 
did; 
And 
I 
had 
not 
before 
that 
time, 
been 
sad 
before 
the 
king. 


In 
things 
that 
are 
tender 
and 
unpleasing, 
it 
is 
good 
to 
break 
the 
ice, 
by 
some 
whose 
words 
are 
of 
less 
weight, 
and 
to 
reserve 
the 
more 
weighty 
voice, 
to 
come 
in 
as 
by 
chance, 
so 
that 
he 
may 
be 
asked 
the 
question 
upon 
the 
other’s 
speech: 
as 
Narcissus 
did, 
relating 
to 
Claudius 
the 
marriage 
of 
Messalina 
and 
Silius. 


In 
things 
that 
a 
man 
would 
not 
be 
seen 
in 
himself, 
it 
is 
a 
point 
of 
cunning, 
to 
borrow 
the 
name 
of 
the 
world; 
as 
to 
say, 
The 
world 
says, 
or 
There 
is 
a 
speech 
abroad. 


I 
knew 
one 
that, 
when 
he 
wrote 
a 
letter, 
he 
would 
put 
that, 
which 
was 
most 
material, 
in 
the 
postscript, 
as 
if 
it 
had 
been 
a 
by-matter. 


I 
knew 
another 
that, 
when 
he 
came 
to 
have 
speech, 
he 
would 
pass 
over 
that, 
that 
he 
intended 
most; 
and 
go 
forth, 
and 
come 
back 
again, 
and 
speak 
of 
it 
as 
of 
a 
thing, 
that 
he 
had 
almost 
forgot. 


Some 
procure 
themselves, 
to 
be 
surprised, 
at 
such 
times 
as 
it 
is 
like 
the 
party 
that 
they 
work 
upon, 
will 
suddenly 
come 
upon 
them; 
and 
to 
be 
found 
with 
a 
letter 
in 
their 
hand 
or 
doing 
somewhat 
which 
they 
are 
not 
accustomed; 
to 
the 
end, 
they 
may 
be 
apposed 
of 
those 
things, 
which 
of 
themselves 
they 
are 
desirous 
to 
utter. 


It 
is 
a 
point 
of 
cunning, 
to 
let 
fall 
those 
words 
in 
a 
man’s 
own 
name, 
which 
he 
would 
have 
another 
man 
learn, 
and 
use, 
and 
thereupon 
take 
advantage. 
I 
knew 
two, 
that 
were 
competitors 
for 
the 
secretary’s 
place 
in 
Queen 
Elizabeth’s 
time, 
and 
yet 
kept 
good 
quarter 
between 
themselves; 
and 
would 
confer, 
one 
with 
another, 
upon 
the 
business; 
and 
the 
one 
of 
them 
said, 
That 
to 
be 
a 
secretary, 
in 
the 
declination 
of 
a 
monarchy, 
was 
a 
ticklish 
thing, 
and 
that 
he 
did 
not 
affect 
it: 
the 
other 
straight 
caught 
up 
those 
words, 
and 
discoursed 
with 
divers 
of 
his 
friends, 
that 
he 
had 
no 
reason 
to 
desire 
to 
be 
secretary, 
in 
the 
declination 
of 
a 
monarchy. 
The 
first 
man 
took 
hold 
of 
it, 
and 



found 
means 
it 
was 
told 
the 
Queen; 
who, 
hearing 
of 
a 
declination 
of 
a 
monarchy, 
took 
it 
so 
ill, 
as 
she 
would 
never 
after 
hear 
of 
the 
other’s 
suit. 


There 
is 
a 
cunning, 
which 
we 
in 
England 
can, 
the 
turning 
of 
the 
cat 
in 
the 
pan; 
which 
is, 
when 
that 
which 
a 
man 
says 
to 
another, 
he 
lays 
it 
as 
if 
another 
had 
said 
it 
to 
him. 
And 
to 
say 
truth, 
it 
is 
not 
easy, 
when 
such 
a 
matter 
passed 
between 
two, 
to 
make 
it 
appear 
from 
which 
of 
them 
it 
first 
moved 
and 
began. 


It 
is 
a 
way 
that 
some 
men 
have, 
to 
glance 
and 
dart 
at 
others, 
by 
justifying 
themselves 
by 
negatives; 
as 
to 
say, 
This 
I 
do 
not; 
as 
Tigellinus 
did 
towards 
Burrhus, 
Se 
non 
diversas 
spes, 
sed 
incolumitatem 
imperatoris 
simpliciter 
spectare. 


Some 
have 
in 
readiness 
so 
many 
tales 
and 
stories, 
as 
there 
is 
nothing 
they 
would 
insinuate, 
but 
they 
can 
wrap 
it 
into 
a 
tale; 
which 
serveth 
both 
to 
keep 
themselves 
more 
in 
guard, 
and 
to 
make 
others 
carry 
it 
with 
more 
pleasure. 
It 
is 
a 
good 
point 
of 
cunning, 
for 
a 
man 
to 
shape 
the 
answer 
he 
would 
have, 
in 
his 
own 
words 
and 
propositions; 
for 
it 
makes 
the 
other 
party 
stick 
the 
less. 


It 
is 
strange 
how 
long 
some 
men 
will 
lie 
in 
wait 
to 
speak 
somewhat 
they 
desire 
to 
say; 
and 
how 
far 
about 
they 
will 
fetch; 
and 
how 
many 
other 
matters 
they 
will 
beat 
over, 
to 
come 
near 
it. 
It 
is 
a 
thing 
of 
great 
patience, 
but 
yet 
of 
much 
use. 


A 
sudden, 
bold, 
and 
unexpected 
question 
doth 
many 
times 
surprise 
a 
man, 
and 
lay 
him 
open. 
Like 
to 
him 
that, 
having 
changed 
his 
name, 
and 
walking 
in 
Paul’s, 
another 
suddenly 
came 
behind 
him, 
and 
called 
him 
by 
his 
true 
name 
whereat 
straightways 
he 
looked 
back. 


But 
these 
small 
wares, 
and 
petty 
points, 
of 
cunning, 
are 
infinite; 
and 
it 
were 
a 
good 
deed 
to 
make 
a 
list 
of 
them; 
for 
that 
nothing 
doth 
more 
hurt 
in 
a 
state, 
than 
that 
cunning 
men 
pass 
for 
wise. 


But 
certainly 
some 
there 
are 
that 
know 
the 
resorts 
and 
fans 
of 
business, 
that 
cannot 
sink 
into 
the 
main 
of 
it; 
like 
a 
house 
that 
hath 
convenient 
stairs 
and 
entries, 
but 
never 
a 
fair 
room. 
Therefore 
you 
shall 
see 
them 
find 
out 
pretty 
looses 
in 
the 
conclusion, 
but 
are 
no 
ways 
able 
to 
examine 
or 
debate 
matters. 
And 
yet 
commonly 
they 
take 
advantage 
of 
their 
inability, 
and 
would 
be 
thought 
wits 
of 
direction. 
Some 
build 
rather 
upon 
the 
abusing 



of 
others, 
and 
(as 
we 
now 
say) 
putting 
tricks 
upon 
them, 
than 
upon 
soundness 
of 
their 
own 
proceedings. 
But 
Solomon 
saith, 
Prudens 
advertit 
ad 
gressus 
suos; 
stultus 
divertit 
ad 
dolos. 



OF 
WISDOM 
FOR 
A 
MAN’S 
SELF 


An 
ant 
is 
a 
wise 
creature 
for 
itself, 
but 
it 
is 
a 
shrewd 
thing, 
in 
an 
orchard 
or 
garden. 
And 
certainly, 
men 
that 
are 
great 
lovers 
of 
themselves, 
waste 
the 
public. 
Divide 
with 
reason; 
between 
selflove 
and 
society; 
and 
be 
so 
true 
to 
thyself, 
as 
thou 
be 
not 
false 
to 
others; 
specially 
to 
thy 
king 
and 
country. 
It 
is 
a 
poor 
centre 
of 
a 
man’s 
actions, 
himself. 
It 
is 
right 
earth. 
For 
that 
only 
stands 
fast 
upon 
his 
own 
centre; 
whereas 
all 
things, 
that 
have 
affinity 
with 
the 
heavens, 
move 
upon 
the 
centre 
of 
another, 
which 
they 
benefit. 
The 
referring 
of 
all 
to 
a 
man’s 
self, 
is 
more 
tolerable 
in 
a 
sovereign 
prince; 
because 
themselves 
are 
not 
only 
themselves, 
but 
their 
good 
and 
evil 
is 
at 
the 
peril 
of 
the 
public 
fortune. 
But 
it 
is 
a 
desperate 
evil, 
in 
a 
servant 
to 
a 
prince, 
or 
a 
citizen 
in 
a 
republic. 
For 
whatsoever 
affairs 
pass 
such 
a 
man’s 
hands, 
he 
crooketh 
them 
to 
his 
own 
ends; 
which 
must 
needs 
be 
often 
eccentric 
to 
the 
ends 
of 
his 
master, 
or 
state. 
Therefore, 
let 
princes, 
or 
states, 
choose 
such 
servants, 
as 
have 
not 
this 
mark; 
except 
they 
mean 
their 
service 
should 
be 
made 
but 
the 
accessory. 
That 
which 
maketh 
the 
effect 
more 
pernicious, 
is 
that 
all 
proportion 
is 
lost. 
It 
were 
disproportion 
enough, 
for 
the 
servant’s 
good 
to 
be 
preferred 
before 
the 
master’s; 
but 
yet 
it 
is 
a 
greater 
extreme, 
when 
a 
little 
good 
of 
the 
servant, 
shall 
carry 
things 
against 
a 
great 
good 
of 
the 
master’s. 
And 
yet 
that 
is 
the 
case 
of 
bad 
officers, 
treasurers, 
ambassadors, 
generals, 
and 
other 
false 
and 
corrupt 
servants; 
which 
set 
a 
bias 
upon 
their 
bowl, 
of 
their 
own 
petty 
ends 
and 
envies, 
to 
the 
overthrow 
of 
their 
master’s 
great 
and 
important 
affairs. 
And 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
the 
good 
such 
servants 
receive, 
is 
after 
the 
model 
of 
their 
own 
fortune; 
but 
the 
hurt 
they 
sell 
for 
that 
good, 
is 
after 
the 
model 
of 
their 
master’s 
fortune. 
And 
certainly 
it 
is 
the 
nature 
of 
extreme 
self-lovers, 
as 
they 
will 
set 
an 
house 
on 
fire, 
and 
it 
were 
but 
to 
roast 
their 
eggs; 
and 
yet 
these 
men 
many 
times 
hold 
credit 
with 
their 
masters, 
because 
their 
study 
is 
but 
to 
please 
them, 
and 
profit 
themselves; 
and 
for 
either 
respect, 
they 
will 
abandon 
the 
good 
of 
their 
affairs. 


Wisdom 
for 
a 
man’s 
self 
is, 
in 
many 
branches 
thereof, 
a 
depraved 
thing. 
It 
is 
the 
wisdom 
of 
rats, 
that 
will 
be 
sure 
to 
leave 
a 
house, 
somewhat 
before 
it 
fall. 
It 
is 
the 
wisdom 
of 
the 
fox, 
that 
thrusts 
out 
the 
badger, 
who 



digged 
and 
made 
room 
for 
him. 
It 
is 
the 
wisdom 
of 
crocodiles, 
that 
shed 
tears 
when 
they 
would 
devour. 
But 
that 
which 
is 
specially 
to 
be 
noted 
is, 
that 
those 
which 
(as 
Cicero 
says 
of 
Pompey) 
are 
sui 
amantes, 
sine 
rivali, 
are 
many 
times 
unfortunate. 
And 
whereas 
they 
have, 
all 
their 
times, 
sacrificed 
to 
themselves, 
they 
become 
in 
the 
end, 
themselves 
sacrifices 
to 
the 
inconstancy 
of 
fortune, 
whose 
wings 
they 
thought, 
by 
their 
self-wisdom, 
to 
have 
pinioned. 



OF 
INNOVATIONS 


As 
the 
births 
of 
living 
creatures, 
at 
first 
are 
ill-shapen 
so 
are 
all 
innovations, 
which 
are 
the 
births 
of 
time. 
Yet 
notwithstanding, 
as 
those 
that 
first 
bring 
honor 
into 
their 
family, 
are 
commonly 
more 
worthy 
than 
most 
that 
succeed, 
so 
the 
first 
precedent 
(if 
it 
be 
good) 
is 
seldom 
attained 
by 
imitation. 
For 
ill, 
to 
man’s 
nature, 
as 
it 
stands 
perverted, 
hath 
a 
natural 
motion, 
strongest 
in 
continuance; 
but 
good, 
as 
a 
forced 
motion, 
strongest 
at 
first. 
Surely 
every 
medicine 
is 
an 
innovation; 
and 
he 
that 
will 
not 
apply 
new 
remedies, 
must 
expect 
new 
evils; 
for 
time 
is 
the 
greatest 
innovator; 
and 
if 
time 
of 
course 
alter 
things 
to 
the 
worse, 
and 
wisdom 
and 
counsel 
shall 
not 
alter 
them 
to 
the 
better, 
what 
shall 
be 
the 
end? 
It 
is 
true, 
that 
what 
is 
settled 
by 
custom, 
though 
it 
be 
not 
good, 
yet 
at 
least 
it 
is 
fit; 
and 
those 
things 
which 
have 
long 
gone 
together, 
are, 
as 
it 
were, 
confederate 
within 
themselves; 
whereas 
new 
things 
piece 
not 
so 
well; 
but 
though 
they 
help 
by 
their 
utility, 
yet 
they 
trouble 
by 
their 
inconformity. 
Besides, 
they 
are 
like 
strangers; 
more 
admired, 
and 
less 
favored. 
All 
this 
is 
true, 
if 
time 
stood 
still; 
which 
contrariwise 
moveth 
so 
round, 
that 
a 
froward 
retention 
of 
custom, 
is 
as 
turbulent 
a 
thing 
as 
an 
innovation; 
and 
they 
that 
reverence 
too 
much 
old 
times, 
are 
but 
a 
scorn 
to 
the 
new. 
It 
were 
good, 
therefore, 
that 
men 
in 
their 
innovations 
would 
follow 
the 
example 
of 
time 
itself; 
which 
indeed 
innovateth 
greatly, 
but 
quietly, 
by 
degrees 
scarce 
to 
be 
perceived. 
For 
otherwise, 
whatsoever 
is 
new 
is 
unlooked 
for; 
and 
ever 
it 
mends 
some, 
and 
pairs 
others; 
and 
he 
that 
holpen, 
takes 
it 
for 
a 
fortune, 
and 
thanks 
the 
time; 
and 
he 
that 
is 
hurt, 
for 
a 
wrong, 
and 
imputeth 
it 
to 
the 
author. 
It 
is 
good 
also, 
not 
to 
try 
experiments 
in 
states, 
except 
the 
necessity 
be 
urgent, 
or 
the 
utility 
evident; 
and 
well 
to 
beware, 
that 
it 
be 
the 
reformation, 
that 
draweth 
on 
the 
change, 
and 
not 
the 
desire 
of 
change, 
that 
pretendeth 
the 
reformation. 
And 
lastly, 
that 
the 
novelty, 
though 
it 
be 
not 
rejected, 
yet 
be 
held 
for 
a 
suspect; 
and, 
as 
the 
Scripture 
saith, 
that 
we 
make 
a 
stand 
upon 
the 
ancient 
way, 
and 
then 
look 
about 
us, 
and 
discover 
what 
is 
the 
straight 
and 
right 
way, 
and 
so 
to 
walk 
in 
it. 



 
OF 
DISPATCH 


Affected 
dispatch 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
dangerous 
things 
to 
business 
that 
can 
be. 
It 
is 
like 
that, 
which 
the 
physicians 
call 
predigestion, 
or 
hasty 
digestion; 
which 
is 
sure 
to 
fill 
the 
body 
full 
of 
crudities, 
and 
secret 
seeds 
of 
diseases. 
Therefore 
measure 
not 
dispatch, 
by 
the 
times 
of 
sitting, 
but 
by 
the 
advancement 
of 
the 
business. 
And 
as 
in 
races 
it 
is 
not 
the 
large 
stride 
or 
high 
lift 
that 
makes 
the 
speed; 
so 
in 
business, 
the 
keeping 
close 
to 
the 
matter, 
and 
not 
taking 
of 
it 
too 
much 
at 
once, 
procureth 
dispatch. 
It 
is 
the 
care 
of 
some, 
only 
to 
come 
off 
speedily 
for 
the 
time; 
or 
to 
contrive 
some 
false 
periods 
of 
business, 
because 
they 
may 
seem 
men 
of 
dispatch. 
But 
it 
is 
one 
thing, 
to 
abbreviate 
by 
contracting, 
another 
by 
cutting 
off. 
And 
business 
so 
handled, 
at 
several 
sittings 
or 
meetings, 
goeth 
commonly 
backward 
and 
forward 
in 
an 
unsteady 
manner. 
I 
knew 
a 
wise 
man 
that 
had 
it 
for 
a 
byword, 
when 
he 
saw 
men 
hasten 
to 
a 
conclusion, 
Stay 
a 
little, 
that 
we 
may 
make 
an 
end 
the 
sooner. 


On 
the 
other 
side, 
true 
dispatch 
is 
a 
rich 
thing. 
For 
time 
is 
the 
measure 
of 
business, 
as 
money 
is 
of 
wares; 
and 
business 
is 
bought 
at 
a 
dear 
hand, 
where 
there 
is 
small 
dispatch. 
The 
Spartans 
and 
Spaniards 
have 
been 
noted 
to 
be 
of 
small 
dispatch; 
Mi 
venga 
la 
muerte 
de 
Spagna; 
Let 
my 
death 
come 
from 
Spain; 
for 
then 
it 
will 
be 
sure 
to 
be 
long 
in 
coming. 


Give 
good 
hearing 
to 
those, 
that 
give 
the 
first 
information 
in 
business; 
and 
rather 
direct 
them 
in 
the 
beginning, 
than 
interrupt 
them 
in 
the 
continuance 
of 
their 
speeches; 
for 
he 
that 
is 
put 
out 
of 
his 
own 
order, 
will 
go 
forward 
and 
backward, 
and 
be 
more 
tedious, 
while 
he 
waits 
upon 
his 
memory, 
than 
he 
could 
have 
been, 
if 
he 
had 
gone 
on 
in 
his 
own 
course. 
But 
sometimes 
it 
is 
seen, 
that 
the 
moderator 
is 
more 
troublesome, 
than 
the 
actor. 


Iterations 
are 
commonly 
loss 
of 
time. 
But 
there 
is 
no 
such 
gain 
of 
time, 
as 
to 
iterate 
often 
the 
state 
of 
the 
question; 
for 
it 
chaseth 
away 
many 
a 
frivolous 
speech, 
as 
it 
is 
coming 
forth. 
Long 
and 
curious 
speeches, 
are 
as 
fit 
for 
dispatch, 
as 
a 
robe 
or 
mantle, 
with 
a 
long 
train, 
is 
for 
race. 
Prefaces 
and 
passages, 
and 
excusations, 
and 
other 
speeches 
of 
reference 
to 
the 
person, 
are 
great 
wastes 
of 
time; 
and 
though 
they 
seem 
to 
proceed 
of 
modesty, 
they 
are 



bravery. 
Yet 
beware 
of 
being 
too 
material, 
when 
there 
is 
any 
impediment 
or 
obstruction 
in 
men’s 
wills; 
for 
pre-occupation 
of 
mind 
ever 
requireth 
preface 
of 
speech; 
like 
a 
fomentation 
to 
make 
the 
unguent 
enter. 


Above 
all 
things, 
order, 
and 
distribution, 
and 
singling 
out 
of 
parts, 
is 
the 
life 
of 
dispatch; 
so 
as 
the 
distribution 
be 
not 
too 
subtle: 
for 
he 
that 
doth 
not 
divide, 
will 
never 
enter 
well 
into 
business; 
and 
he 
that 
divideth 
too 
much, 
will 
never 
come 
out 
of 
it 
clearly. 
To 
choose 
time, 
is 
to 
save 
time; 
and 
an 
unseasonable 
motion, 
is 
but 
beating 
the 
air. 
There 
be 
three 
parts 
of 
business; 
the 
preparation, 
the 
debate 
or 
examination, 
and 
the 
perfection. 
Whereof, 
if 
you 
look 
for 
dispatch, 
let 
the 
middle 
only 
be 
the 
work 
of 
many, 
and 
the 
first 
and 
last 
the 
work 
of 
few. 
The 
proceeding 
upon 
somewhat 
conceived 
in 
writing, 
doth 
for 
the 
most 
part 
facilitate 
dispatch: 
for 
though 
it 
should 
be 
wholly 
rejected, 
yet 
that 
negative 
is 
more 
pregnant 
of 
direction, 
than 
an 
indefinite; 
as 
ashes 
are 
more 
generative 
than 
dust. 



OF 
SEEMING 
WISE 


It 
hath 
been 
an 
opinion, 
that 
the 
French 
are 
wiser 
than 
they 
seem, 
and 
the 
Spaniards 
seem 
wiser 
than 
they 
are. 
But 
howsoever 
it 
be 
between 
nations, 
certainly 
it 
is 
so 
between 
man 
and 
man. 
For 
as 
the 
Apostle 
saith 
of 
godliness, 
Having 
a 
show 
of 
godliness, 
but 
denying 
the 
power 
thereof; 
so 
certainly 
there 
are, 
in 
point 
of 
wisdom 
and 
sufficiently, 
that 
do 
nothing 
or 
little 
very 
solemnly: 
magno 
conatu 
nugas. 
It 
is 
a 
ridiculous 
thing, 
and 
fit 
for 
a 
satire 
to 
persons 
of 
judgment, 
to 
see 
what 
shifts 
these 
formalists 
have, 
and 
what 
prospectives 
to 
make 
superficies 
to 
seem 
body, 
that 
hath 
depth 
and 
bulk. 
Some 
are 
so 
close 
and 
reserved, 
as 
they 
will 
not 
show 
their 
wares, 
but 
by 
a 
dark 
light; 
and 
seem 
always 
to 
keep 
back 
somewhat; 
and 
when 
they 
know 
within 
themselves, 
they 
speak 
of 
that 
they 
do 
not 
well 
know, 
would 
nevertheless 
seem 
to 
others, 
to 
know 
of 
that 
which 
they 
may 
not 
well 
speak. 
Some 
help 
themselves 
with 
countenance 
and 
gesture, 
and 
are 
wise 
by 
signs; 
as 
Cicero 
saith 
of 
Piso, 
that 
when 
he 
answered 
him 
he 
fetched 
one 
of 
his 
brows 
up 
to 
his 
forehead, 
and 
bent 
the 
other 
down 
to 
his 
chin; 
Respondes, 
altero 
ad 
frontem 
sublato, 
altero 
ad 
mentum 
depresso 
supercilio, 
crudelitatem 
tibi 
non 
placere. 
Some 
think 
to 
bear 
it 
by 
speaking 
a 
great 
word, 
and 
being 
peremptory; 
and 
go 
on, 
and 
take 
by 
admittance, 
that 
which 
they 
cannot 
make 
good. 
Some, 
whatsoever 
is 
beyond 
their 
reach, 
will 
seem 
to 
despise, 
or 
make 
light 
of 
it, 
as 
impertinent 
or 
curious; 
and 
so 
would 
have 
their 
ignorance 
seem 
judgment. 
Some 
are 
never 
without 
a 
difference, 
and 
commonly 
by 
amusing 
men 
with 
a 
subtilty, 
blanch 
the 
matter; 
of 
whom 
A. 
Gellius 
saith, 
Hominem 
delirum, 
qui 
verborum 
minutiis 
rerum 
frangit 
pondera. 
Of 
which 
kind 
also, 
Plato, 
in 
his 
Protagoras, 
bringeth 
in 
Prodius 
in 
scorn, 
and 
maketh 
him 
make 
a 
speech, 
that 
consisteth 
of 
distinction 
from 
the 
beginning 
to 
the 
end. 
Generally, 
such 
men 
in 
all 
deliberations 
find 
ease 
to 
be 
of 
the 
negative 
side, 
and 
affect 
a 
credit 
to 
object 
and 
foretell 
difficulties; 
for 
when 
propositions 
are 
denied, 
there 
is 
an 
end 
of 
them; 
but 
if 
they 
be 
allowed, 
it 
requireth 
a 
new 
work; 
which 
false 
point 
of 
wisdom 
is 
the 
bane 
of 
business. 
To 
conclude, 
there 
is 
no 
decaying 
merchant, 
or 
inward 
beggar, 
hath 
so 
many 
tricks 
to 
uphold 
the 
credit 
of 
their 
wealth, 
as 
these 
empty 
persons 
have, 
to 
maintain 
the 
credit 
of 
their 
sufficiency. 
Seeming 
wise 
men 
may 
make 
shift 
to 
get 
opinion; 
but 
let 
no 



man 
choose 
them 
for 
employment; 
for 
certainly 
you 
were 
better 
take 
for 
business, 
a 
man 
somewhat 
absurd, 
than 
over-formal. 



OF 
FRIENDSHIP 


It 
had 
been 
hard 
for 
him 
that 
spake 
it 
to 
have 
put 
more 
truth 
and 
untruth 
together 
in 
few 
words, 
than 
in 
that 
speech. 
Whatsoever 
is 
delighted 
in 
solitude, 
is 
either 
a 
wild 
beast 
or 
a 
god. 
For 
it 
is 
most 
true, 
that 
a 
natural 
and 
secret 
hatred, 
and 
aversation 
towards 
society, 
in 
any 
man, 
hath 
somewhat 
of 
the 
savage 
beast; 
but 
it 
is 
most 
untrue, 
that 
it 
should 
have 
any 
character 
at 
all, 
of 
the 
divine 
nature; 
except 
it 
proceed, 
not 
out 
of 
a 
pleasure 
in 
solitude, 
but 
out 
of 
a 
love 
and 
desire 
to 
sequester 
a 
man’s 
self, 
for 
a 
higher 
conversation: 
such 
as 
is 
found 
to 
have 
been 
falsely 
and 
feignedly 
in 
some 
of 
the 
heathen; 
as 
Epimenides 
the 
Candian, 
Numa 
the 
Roman, 
Empedocles 
the 
Sicilian, 
and 
Apollonius 
of 
Tyana; 
and 
truly 
and 
really, 
in 
divers 
of 
the 
ancient 
hermits 
and 
holy 
fathers 
of 
the 
church. 
But 
little 
do 
men 
perceive 
what 
solitude 
is, 
and 
how 
far 
it 
extendeth. 
For 
a 
crowd 
is 
not 
company; 
and 
faces 
are 
but 
a 
gallery 
of 
pictures; 
and 
talk 
but 
a 
tinkling 
cymbal, 
where 
there 
is 
no 
love. 
The 
Latin 
adage 
meeteth 
with 
it 
a 
little: 
Magna 
civitas, 
magna 
solitudo; 
because 
in 
a 
great 
town 
friends 
are 
scattered; 
so 
that 
there 
is 
not 
that 
fellowship, 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
which 
is 
in 
less 
neighborhoods. 
But 
we 
may 
go 
further, 
and 
affirm 
most 
truly, 
that 
it 
is 
a 
mere 
and 
miserable 
solitude 
to 
want 
true 
friends; 
without 
which 
the 
world 
is 
but 
a 
wilderness; 
and 
even 
in 
this 
sense 
also 
of 
solitude, 
whosoever 
in 
the 
frame 
of 
his 
nature 
and 
affections, 
is 
unfit 
for 
friendship, 
he 
taketh 
it 
of 
the 
beast, 
and 
not 
from 
humanity. 


A 
principal 
fruit 
of 
friendship, 
is 
the 
ease 
and 
discharge 
of 
the 
fulness 
and 
swellings 
of 
the 
heart, 
which 
passions 
of 
all 
kinds 
do 
cause 
and 
induce. 
We 
know 
diseases 
of 
stoppings, 
and 
suffocations, 
are 
the 
most 
dangerous 
in 
the 
body; 
and 
it 
is 
not 
much 
otherwise 
in 
the 
mind; 
you 
may 
take 
sarza 
to 
open 
the 
liver, 
steel 
to 
open 
the 
spleen, 
flowers 
of 
sulphur 
for 
the 
lungs, 
castoreum 
for 
the 
brain; 
but 
no 
receipt 
openeth 
the 
heart, 
but 
a 
true 
friend; 
to 
whom 
you 
may 
impart 
griefs, 
joys, 
fears, 
hopes, 
suspicions, 
counsels, 
and 
whatsoever 
lieth 
upon 
the 
heart 
to 
oppress 
it, 
in 
a 
kind 
of 
civil 
shrift 
or 
confession. 


It 
is 
a 
strange 
thing 
to 
observe, 
how 
high 
a 
rate 
great 
kings 
and 
monarchs 
do 
set 
upon 
this 
fruit 
of 
friendship, 
whereof 
we 
speak: 
so 
great, 
as 



they 
purchase 
it, 
many 
times, 
at 
the 
hazard 
of 
their 
own 
safety 
and 
greatness. 
For 
princes, 
in 
regard 
of 
the 
distance 
of 
their 
fortune 
from 
that 
of 
their 
subjects 
and 
servants, 
cannot 
gather 
this 
fruit, 
except 
(to 
make 
themselves 
capable 
thereof) 
they 
raise 
some 
persons 
to 
be, 
as 
it 
were, 
companions 
and 
almost 
equals 
to 
themselves, 
which 
many 
times 
sorteth 
to 
inconvenience. 
The 
modern 
languages 
give 
unto 
such 
persons 
the 
name 
of 
favorites, 
or 
privadoes; 
as 
if 
it 
were 
matter 
of 
grace, 
or 
conversation. 
But 
the 
Roman 
name 
attaineth 
the 
true 
use 
and 
cause 
thereof, 
naming 
them 
participes 
curarum; 
for 
it 
is 
that 
which 
tieth 
the 
knot. 
And 
we 
see 
plainly 
that 
this 
hath 
been 
done, 
not 
by 
weak 
and 
passionate 
princes 
only, 
but 
by 
the 
wisest 
and 
most 
politic 
that 
ever 
reigned; 
who 
have 
oftentimes 
joined 
to 
themselves 
some 
of 
their 
servants; 
whom 
both 
themselves 
have 
called 
friends, 
and 
allowed 
other 
likewise 
to 
call 
them 
in 
the 
same 
manner; 
using 
the 
word 
which 
is 
received 
between 
private 
men. 


L. 
Sylla, 
when 
he 
commanded 
Rome, 
raised 
Pompey 
(after 
surnamed 
the 
Great) 
to 
that 
height, 
that 
Pompey 
vaunted 
himself 
for 
Sylla’s 
overmatch. 
For 
when 
he 
had 
carried 
the 
consulship 
for 
a 
friend 
of 
his, 
against 
the 
pursuit 
of 
Sylla, 
and 
that 
Sylla 
did 
a 
little 
resent 
thereat, 
and 
began 
to 
speak 
great, 
Pompey 
turned 
upon 
him 
again, 
and 
in 
effect 
bade 
him 
be 
quiet; 
for 
that 
more 
men 
adored 
the 
sun 
rising, 
than 
the 
sun 
setting. 
With 
Julius 
Caesar, 
Decimus 
Brutus 
had 
obtained 
that 
interest, 
as 
he 
set 
him 
down, 
in 
his 
testament, 
for 
heir 
in 
remainder, 
after 
his 
nephew. 
And 
this 
was 
the 
man 
that 
had 
power 
with 
him, 
to 
draw 
him 
forth 
to 
his 
death. 
For 
when 
Caesar 
would 
have 
discharged 
the 
senate, 
in 
regard 
of 
some 
ill 
presages, 
and 
specially 
a 
dream 
of 
Calpurnia; 
this 
man 
lifted 
him 
gently 
by 
the 
arm 
out 
of 
his 
chair, 
telling 
him 
he 
hoped 
he 
would 
not 
dismiss 
the 
senate, 
till 
his 
wife 
had 
dreamt 
a 
better 
dream. 
And 
it 
seemeth 
his 
favor 
was 
so 
great, 
as 
Antonius, 
in 
a 
letter 
which 
is 
recited 
verbatim 
in 
one 
of 
Cicero’s 
Philippics, 
calleth 
him 
venefica, 
witch; 
as 
if 
he 
had 
enchanted 
Caesar. 
Augustus 
raised 
Agrippa 
(though 
of 
mean 
birth) 
to 
that 
height, 
as 
when 
he 
consulted 
with 
Maecenas, 
about 
the 
marriage 
of 
his 
daughter 
Julia, 
Maecenas 
took 
the 
liberty 
to 
tell 
him, 
that 
he 
must 
either 
marry 
his 
daughter 
to 
Agrippa, 
or 
take 
away 
his 
life; 
there 
was 
no 
third 
war, 
he 
had 
made 
him 
so 
great. 
With 
Tiberius 
Caesar, 
Sejanus 
had 
ascended 
to 
that 
height, 
as 
they 
two 
were 
termed, 
and 
reckoned, 
as 
a 
pair 
of 
friends. 
Tiberius 
in 
a 
letter 
to 
him 
saith, 
Haec 
pro 
amicitia 
nostra 
non 
occultavi; 
and 
the 
whole 
senate 
dedicated 
an 
altar 
to 
Friendship, 
as 
to 
a 
goddess, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
great 
dearness 
of 
friendship, 
between 
them 
two. 

The 
like, 
or 
more, 
was 
between 
Septimius 
Severus 
and 
Plautianus. 
For 
he 
forced 
his 
eldest 
son 
to 
marry 
the 
daughter 
of 
Plautianus; 
and 
would 
often 
maintain 
Plautianus, 
in 
doing 
affronts 
to 
his 
son; 
and 
did 
write 
also 
in 
a 
letter 
to 
the 
senate, 
by 
these 
words: 
I 
love 
the 
man 
so 
well, 
as 
I 
wish 
he 
may 
over-
live 
me. 
Now 
if 
these 
princes 
had 
been 
as 
a 
Trajan, 
or 
a 
Marcus 
Aurelius, 
a 
man 
might 
have 
thought 
that 
this 
had 
proceeded 
of 
an 
abundant 
goodness 
of 
nature; 
but 
being 
men 
so 
wise, 
of 
such 
strength 
and 
severity 
of 
mind, 
and 
so 
extreme 
lovers 
of 
themselves, 
as 
all 
these 
were, 
it 
proveth 
most 
plainly 
that 
they 
found 
their 
own 
felicity 
(though 
as 
great 
as 
ever 
happened 
to 
mortal 
men) 
but 
as 
an 
half 
piece, 
except 
they 
mought 
have 
a 
friend, 
to 
make 
it 
entire; 
and 
yet, 
which 
is 
more, 
they 
were 
princes 
that 
had 
wives, 
sons, 
nephews; 
and 
yet 
all 
these 
could 
not 
supply 
the 
comfort 
of 
friendship. 


It 
is 
not 
to 
be 
forgotten, 
what 
Comineus 
observeth 
of 
his 
first 
master, 
Duke 
Charles 
the 
Hardy, 
namely, 
that 
he 
would 
communicate 
his 
secrets 
with 
none; 
and 
least 
of 
all, 
those 
secrets 
which 
troubled 
him 
most. 
Whereupon 
he 
goeth 
on, 
and 
saith 
that 
towards 
his 
latter 
time, 
that 
closeness 
did 
impair, 
and 
a 
little 
perish 
his 
understanding. 
Surely 
Comineus 
mought 
have 
made 
the 
same 
judgment 
also, 
if 
it 
had 
pleased 
him, 
of 
his 
second 
master, 
Lewis 
the 
Eleventh, 
whose 
closeness 
was 
indeed 
his 
tormentor. 
The 
parable 
of 
Pythagoras 
is 
dark, 
but 
true; 
Cor 
ne 
edito; 
Eat 
not 
the 
heart. 
Certainly 
if 
a 
man 
would 
give 
it 
a 
hard 
phrase, 
those 
that 
want 
friends, 
to 
open 
themselves 
unto 
are 
cannibals 
of 
their 
own 
hearts. 
But 
one 
thing 
is 
most 
admirable 
(wherewith 
I 
will 
conclude 
this 
first 
fruit 
of 
friendship), 
which 
is, 
that 
this 
communicating 
of 
a 
man’s 
self 
to 
his 
friend, 
works 
two 
contrary 
effects; 
for 
it 
redoubleth 
joys, 
and 
cutteth 
griefs 
in 
halves. 
For 
there 
is 
no 
man, 
that 
imparteth 
his 
joys 
to 
his 
friend, 
but 
he 
joyeth 
the 
more; 
and 
no 
man 
that 
imparteth 
his 
griefs 
to 
his 
friend, 
but 
he 
grieveth 
the 
less. 
So 
that 
it 
is 
in 
truth, 
of 
operation 
upon 
a 
man’s 
mind, 
of 
like 
virtue 
as 
the 
alchemists 
use 
to 
attribute 
to 
their 
stone, 
for 
man’s 
body; 
that 
it 
worketh 
all 
contrary 
effects, 
but 
still 
to 
the 
good 
and 
benefit 
of 
nature. 
But 
yet 
without 
praying 
in 
aid 
of 
alchemists, 
there 
is 
a 
manifest 
image 
of 
this, 
in 
the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
nature. 
For 
in 
bodies, 
union 
strengtheneth 
and 
cherisheth 
any 
natural 
action; 
and 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
weakeneth 
and 
dulleth 
any 
violent 
impression: 
and 
even 
so 
it 
is 
of 
minds. 


The 
second 
fruit 
of 
friendship, 
is 
healthful 
and 
sovereign 
for 
the 
understanding, 
as 
the 
first 
is 
for 
the 
affections. 
For 
friendship 
maketh 
indeed 



a 
fair 
day 
in 
the 
affections, 
from 
storm 
and 
tempests; 
but 
it 
maketh 
daylight 
in 
the 
understanding, 
out 
of 
darkness, 
and 
confusion 
of 
thoughts. 
Neither 
is 
this 
to 
be 
understood 
only 
of 
faithful 
counsel, 
which 
a 
man 
receiveth 
from 
his 
friend; 
but 
before 
you 
come 
to 
that, 
certain 
it 
is, 
that 
whosoever 
hath 
his 
mind 
fraught 
with 
many 
thoughts, 
his 
wits 
and 
understanding 
do 
clarify 
and 
break 
up, 
in 
the 
communicating 
and 
discoursing 
with 
another; 
he 
tosseth 
his 
thoughts 
more 
easily; 
he 
marshalleth 
them 
more 
orderly, 
he 
seeth 
how 
they 
look 
when 
they 
are 
turned 
into 
words: 
finally, 
he 
waxeth 
wiser 
than 
himself; 
and 
that 
more 
by 
an 
hour’s 
discourse, 
than 
by 
a 
day’s 
meditation. 
It 
was 
well 
said 
by 
Themistocles, 
to 
the 
king 
of 
Persia, 
That 
speech 
was 
like 
cloth 
of 
Arras, 
opened 
and 
put 
abroad; 
whereby 
the 
imagery 
doth 
appear 
in 
figure; 
whereas 
in 
thoughts 
they 
lie 
but 
as 
in 
packs. 
Neither 
is 
this 
second 
fruit 
of 
friendship, 
in 
opening 
the 
understanding, 
restrained 
only 
to 
such 
friends 
as 
are 
able 
to 
give 
a 
man 
counsel; 
(they 
indeed 
are 
best;) 
but 
even 
without 
that, 
a 
man 
learneth 
of 
himself, 
and 
bringeth 
his 
own 
thoughts 
to 
light, 
and 
whetteth 
his 
wits 
as 
against 
a 
stone, 
which 
itself 
cuts 
not. 
In 
a 
word, 
a 
man 
were 
better 
relate 
himself 
to 
a 
statua, 
or 
picture, 
than 
to 
suffer 
his 
thoughts 
to 
pass 
in 
smother. 


Add 
now, 
to 
make 
this 
second 
fruit 
of 
friendship 
complete, 
that 
other 
point, 
which 
lieth 
more 
open, 
and 
falleth 
within 
vulgar 
observation; 
which 
is 
faithful 
counsel 
from 
a 
friend. 
Heraclitus 
saith 
well 
in 
one 
of 
his 
enigmas, 
Dry 
light 
is 
ever 
the 
best. 
And 
certain 
it 
is, 
that 
the 
light 
that 
a 
man 
receiveth 
by 
counsel 
from 
another, 
is 
drier 
and 
purer, 
than 
that 
which 
cometh 
from 
his 
own 
understanding 
and 
judgment; 
which 
is 
ever 
infused, 
and 
drenched, 
in 
his 
affections 
and 
customs. 
So 
as 
there 
is 
as 
much 
difference 
between 
the 
counsel, 
that 
a 
friend 
giveth, 
and 
that 
a 
man 
giveth 
himself, 
as 
there 
is 
between 
the 
counsel 
of 
a 
friend, 
and 
of 
a 
flatterer. 
For 
there 
is 
no 
such 
flatterer 
as 
is 
a 
man’s 
self; 
and 
there 
is 
no 
such 
remedy 
against 
flattery 
of 
a 
man’s 
self, 
as 
the 
liberty 
of 
a 
friend. 
Counsel 
is 
of 
two 
sorts: 
the 
one 
concerning 
manners, 
the 
other 
concerning 
business. 
For 
the 
first, 
the 
best 
preservative 
to 
keep 
the 
mind 
in 
health, 
is 
the 
faithful 
admonition 
of 
a 
friend. 
The 
calling 
of 
a 
man’s 
self 
to 
a 
strict 
account, 
is 
a 
medicine, 
sometime 
too 
piercing 
and 
corrosive. 
Reading 
good 
books 
of 
morality, 
is 
a 
little 
flat 
and 
dead. 
Observing 
our 
faults 
in 
others, 
is 
sometimes 
improper 
for 
our 
case. 
But 
the 
best 
receipt 
(best, 
I 
say, 
to 
work, 
and 
best 
to 
take) 
is 
the 
admonition 
of 
a 
friend. 
It 
is 
a 
strange 
thing 
to 
behold, 
what 
gross 
errors 
and 
extreme 
absurdities 
many 
(especially 
of 
the 
greater 
sort) 
do 
commit, 
for 
want 
of 
a 



friend 
to 
tell 
them 
of 
them; 
to 
the 
great 
damage 
both 
of 
their 
fame 
and 
fortune: 
for, 
as 
St. 
James 
saith, 
they 
are 
as 
men 
that 
look 
sometimes 
into 
a 
glass, 
and 
presently 
forget 
their 
own 
shape 
and 
favor. 
As 
for 
business, 
a 
man 
may 
think, 
if 
he 
will, 
that 
two 
eyes 
see 
no 
more 
than 
one; 
or 
that 
a 
gamester 
seeth 
always 
more 
than 
a 
looker-on; 
or 
that 
a 
man 
in 
anger, 
is 
as 
wise 
as 
he 
that 
hath 
said 
over 
the 
four 
and 
twenty 
letters; 
or 
that 
a 
musket 
may 
be 
shot 
off 
as 
well 
upon 
the 
arm, 
as 
upon 
a 
rest; 
and 
such 
other 
fond 
and 
high 
imaginations, 
to 
think 
himself 
all 
in 
all. 
But 
when 
all 
is 
done, 
the 
help 
of 
good 
counsel 
is 
that 
which 
setteth 
business 
straight. 
And 
if 
any 
man 
think 
that 
he 
will 
take 
counsel, 
but 
it 
shall 
be 
by 
pieces; 
asking 
counsel 
in 
one 
business, 
of 
one 
man, 
and 
in 
another 
business, 
of 
another 
man; 
it 
is 
well 
(that 
is 
to 
say, 
better, 
perhaps, 
than 
if 
he 
asked 
none 
at 
all); 
but 
he 
runneth 
two 
dangers: 
one, 
that 
he 
shall 
not 
be 
faithfully 
counselled; 
for 
it 
is 
a 
rare 
thing, 
except 
it 
be 
from 
a 
perfect 
and 
entire 
friend, 
to 
have 
counsel 
given, 
but 
such 
as 
shall 
be 
bowed 
and 
crooked 
to 
some 
ends, 
which 
he 
hath, 
that 
giveth 
it. 
The 
other, 
that 
he 
shall 
have 
counsel 
given, 
hurtful 
and 
unsafe 
(though 
with 
good 
meaning), 
and 
mixed 
partly 
of 
mischief 
and 
partly 
of 
remedy; 
even 
as 
if 
you 
would 
call 
a 
physician, 
that 
is 
thought 
good 
for 
the 
cure 
of 
the 
disease 
you 
complain 
of, 
but 
is 
unacquainted 
with 
your 
body; 
and 
therefore 
may 
put 
you 
in 
way 
for 
a 
present 
cure, 
but 
overthroweth 
your 
health 
in 
some 
other 
kind; 
and 
so 
cure 
the 
disease, 
and 
kill 
the 
patient. 
But 
a 
friend 
that 
is 
wholly 
acquainted 
with 
a 
man’s 
estate, 
will 
beware, 
by 
furthering 
any 
present 
business, 
how 
he 
dasheth 
upon 
other 
inconvenience. 
And 
therefore 
rest 
not 
upon 
scattered 
counsels; 
they 
will 
rather 
distract 
and 
mislead, 
than 
settle 
and 
direct. 


After 
these 
two 
noble 
fruits 
of 
friendship 
(peace 
in 
the 
affections, 
and 
support 
of 
the 
judgment), 
followeth 
the 
last 
fruit; 
which 
is 
like 
the 
pomegranate, 
full 
of 
many 
kernels; 
I 
mean 
aid, 
and 
bearing 
a 
part, 
in 
all 
actions 
and 
occasions. 
Here 
the 
best 
way 
to 
represent 
to 
life 
the 
manifold 
use 
of 
friendship, 
is 
to 
cast 
and 
see 
how 
many 
things 
there 
are, 
which 
a 
man 
cannot 
do 
himself; 
and 
then 
it 
will 
appear, 
that 
it 
was 
a 
sparing 
speech 
of 
the 
ancients, 
to 
say, 
that 
a 
friend 
is 
another 
himself; 
for 
that 
a 
friend 
is 
far 
more 
than 
himself. 
Men 
have 
their 
time, 
and 
die 
many 
times, 
in 
desire 
of 
some 
things 
which 
they 
principally 
take 
to 
heart; 
the 
bestowing 
of 
a 
child, 
the 
finishing 
of 
a 
work, 
or 
the 
like. 
If 
a 
man 
have 
a 
true 
friend, 
he 
may 
rest 
almost 
secure 
that 
the 
care 
of 
those 
things 
will 
continue 
after 
him. 
So 
that 
a 
man 
hath, 
as 
it 
were, 
two 
lives 
in 
his 
desires. 
A 
man 
hath 
a 
body, 
and 
that 



body 
is 
confined 
to 
a 
place; 
but 
where 
friendship 
is, 
all 
offices 
of 
life 
are 
as 
it 
were 
granted 
to 
him, 
and 
his 
deputy. 
For 
he 
may 
exercise 
them 
by 
his 
friend. 
How 
many 
things 
are 
there 
which 
a 
man 
cannot, 
with 
any 
face 
or 
comeliness, 
say 
or 
do 
himself? 
A 
man 
can 
scarce 
allege 
his 
own 
merits 
with 
modesty, 
much 
less 
extol 
them; 
a 
man 
cannot 
sometimes 
brook 
to 
supplicate 
or 
beg; 
and 
a 
number 
of 
the 
like. 
But 
all 
these 
things 
are 
graceful, 
in 
a 
friend’s 
mouth, 
which 
are 
blushing 
in 
a 
man’s 
own. 
So 
again, 
a 
man’s 
person 
hath 
many 
proper 
relations, 
which 
he 
cannot 
put 
off. 
A 
man 
cannot 
speak 
to 
his 
son 
but 
as 
a 
father; 
to 
his 
wife 
but 
as 
a 
husband; 
to 
his 
enemy 
but 
upon 
terms: 
whereas 
a 
friend 
may 
speak 
as 
the 
case 
requires, 
and 
not 
as 
it 
sorteth 
with 
the 
person. 
But 
to 
enumerate 
these 
things 
were 
endless; 
I 
have 
given 
the 
rule, 
where 
a 
man 
cannot 
fitly 
play 
his 
own 
part; 
if 
he 
have 
not 
a 
friend, 
he 
may 
quit 
the 
stage. 



OF 
EXPENSE 


Riches 
are 
for 
spending, 
and 
spending 
for 
honor 
and 
good 
actions. 
Therefore 
extraordinary 
expense 
must 
be 
limited 
by 
the 
worth 
of 
the 
occasion; 
for 
voluntary 
undoing, 
may 
be 
as 
well 
for 
a 
man’s 
country, 
as 
for 
the 
kingdom 
of 
heaven. 
But 
ordinary 
expense, 
ought 
to 
be 
limited 
by 
a 
man’s 
estate; 
and 
governed 
with 
such 
regard, 
as 
it 
be 
within 
his 
compass; 
and 
not 
subject 
to 
deceit 
and 
abuse 
of 
servants; 
and 
ordered 
to 
the 
best 
show, 
that 
the 
bills 
may 
be 
less 
than 
the 
estimation 
abroad. 
Certainly, 
if 
a 
man 
will 
keep 
but 
of 
even 
hand, 
his 
ordinary 
expenses 
ought 
to 
be 
but 
to 
the 
half 
of 
his 
receipts; 
and 
if 
he 
think 
to 
wax 
rich, 
but 
to 
the 
third 
part. 
It 
is 
no 
baseness, 
for 
the 
greatest 
to 
descend 
and 
look 
into 
their 
own 
estate. 
Some 
forbear 
it, 
not 
upon 
negligence 
alone, 
but 
doubting 
to 
bring 
themselves 
into 
melancholy, 
in 
respect 
they 
shall 
find 
it 
broken. 
But 
wounds 
cannot 
be 
cured 
without 
searching. 
He 
that 
cannot 
look 
into 
his 
own 
estate 
at 
all, 
had 
need 
both 
choose 
well 
those 
whom 
he 
employeth, 
and 
change 
them 
often; 
for 
new 
are 
more 
timorous 
and 
less 
subtle. 
He 
that 
can 
look 
into 
his 
estate 
but 
seldom, 
it 
behooveth 
him 
to 
turn 
all 
to 
certainties. 
A 
man 
had 
need, 
if 
he 
be 
plentiful 
in 
some 
kind 
of 
expense, 
to 
be 
as 
saving 
again 
in 
some 
other. 
As 
if 
he 
be 
plentiful 
in 
diet, 
to 
be 
saving 
in 
apparel; 
if 
he 
be 
plentiful 
in 
the 
hall, 
to 
be 
saving 
in 
the 
stable; 
and 
the 
like. 
For 
he 
that 
is 
plentiful 
in 
expenses 
of 
all 
kinds, 
will 
hardly 
be 
preserved 
from 
decay. 
In 
clearing 
of 
a 
man’s 
estate, 
he 
may 
as 
well 
hurt 
himself 
in 
being 
too 
sudden, 
as 
in 
letting 
it 
run 
on 
too 
long. 
For 
hasty 
selling, 
is 
commonly 
as 
disadvantageable 
as 
interest. 
Besides, 
he 
that 
clears 
at 
once 
will 
relapse; 
for 
finding 
himself 
out 
of 
straits, 
he 
will 
revert 
to 
his 
custom: 
but 
he 
that 
cleareth 
by 
degrees, 
induceth 
a 
habit 
of 
frugality, 
and 
gaineth 
as 
well 
upon 
his 
mind, 
as 
upon 
his 
estate. 
Certainly, 
who 
hath 
a 
state 
to 
repair, 
may 
not 
despise 
small 
things; 
and 
commonly 
it 
is 
less 
dishonorable, 
to 
abridge 
petty 
charges, 
than 
to 
stoop 
to 
petty 
gettings. 
A 
man 
ought 
warily 
to 
begin 
charges 
which 
once 
begun 
will 
continue; 
but 
in 
matters 
that 
return 
not, 
he 
may 
be 
more 
magnificent. 



 
OF 
THE 
TRUE 
GREATNESS 
OF 
KINGDOMS 
AND 
ESTATES 


The 
speech 
of 
Themistocles 
the 
Athenian, 
which 
was 
haughty 
and 
arrogant, 
in 
taking 
so 
much 
to 
himself, 
had 
been 
a 
grave 
and 
wise 
observation 
and 
censure, 
applied 
at 
large 
to 
others. 
Desired 
at 
a 
feast 
to 
touch 
a 
lute, 
he 
said, 
He 
could 
not 
fiddle, 
but 
yet 
he 
could 
make 
a 
small 
town, 
a 
great 
city. 
These 
words 
(holpen 
a 
little 
with 
a 
metaphor) 
may 
express 
two 
differing 
abilities, 
in 
those 
that 
deal 
in 
business 
of 
estate. 
For 
if 
a 
true 
survey 
be 
taken 
of 
counsellors 
and 
statesmen, 
there 
may 
be 
found 
(though 
rarely) 
those 
which 
can 
make 
a 
small 
state 
great, 
and 
yet 
cannot 
fiddle; 
as 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
there 
will 
be 
found 
a 
great 
many, 
that 
can 
fiddle 
very 
cunningly, 
but 
yet 
are 
so 
far 
from 
being 
able 
to 
make 
a 
small 
state 
great, 
as 
their 
gift 
lieth 
the 
other 
way; 
to 
bring 
a 
great 
and 
flourishing 
estate, 
to 
ruin 
and 
decay. 
And 
certainly 
whose 
degenerate 
arts 
and 
shifts, 
whereby 
many 
counsellors 
and 
governors 
gain 
both 
favor 
with 
their 
masters, 
and 
estimation 
with 
the 
vulgar, 
deserve 
no 
better 
name 
than 
fiddling; 
being 
things 
rather 
pleasing 
for 
the 
time, 
and 
graceful 
to 
themselves 
only, 
than 
tending 
to 
the 
weal 
and 
advancement 
of 
the 
state 
which 
they 
serve. 
There 
are 
also 
(no 
doubt) 
counsellors 
and 
governors 
which 
may 
be 
held 
sufficient 
(negotiis 
pares), 
able 
to 
manage 
affairs, 
and 
to 
keep 
them 
from 
precipices 
and 
manifest 
inconveniences; 
which 
nevertheless 
are 
far 
from 
the 
ability 
to 
raise 
and 
amplify 
an 
estate 
in 
power, 
means, 
and 
fortune. 
But 
be 
the 
workmen 
what 
they 
may 
be, 
let 
us 
speak 
of 
the 
work; 
that 
is, 
the 
true 
greatness 
of 
kingdoms 
and 
estates, 
and 
the 
means 
thereof. 
An 
argument 
fit 
for 
great 
and 
mighty 
princes 
to 
have 
in 
their 
hand; 
to 
the 
end 
that 
neither 
by 
over-measuring 
their 
forces, 
they 
leese 
themselves 
in 
vain 
enterprises; 
nor 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
by 
undervaluing 
them, 
they 
descend 
to 
fearful 
and 
pusillanimous 
counsels. 


The 
greatness 
of 
an 
estate, 
in 
bulk 
and 
territory, 
doth 
fall 
under 
measure; 
and 
the 
greatness 
of 
finances 
and 
revenue, 
doth 
fall 
under 
computation. 
The 
population 
may 
appear 
by 
musters; 
and 
the 
number 
and 
greatness 
of 
cities 
and 
towns 
by 
cards 
and 
maps. 
But 
yet 
there 
is 
not 
any 
thing 
amongst 
civil 
affairs 
more 
subject 
to 
error, 
than 
the 
right 
valuation 
and 



true 
judgment 
concerning 
the 
power 
and 
forces 
of 
an 
estate. 
The 
kingdom 
of 
heaven 
is 
compared, 
not 
to 
any 
great 
kernel 
or 
nut, 
but 
to 
a 
grain 
of 
mustard-
seed: 
which 
is 
one 
of 
the 
least 
grains, 
but 
hath 
in 
it 
a 
property 
and 
spirit 
hastily 
to 
get 
up 
and 
spread. 
So 
are 
there 
states, 
great 
in 
territory, 
and 
yet 
not 
apt 
to 
enlarge 
or 
command; 
and 
some 
that 
have 
but 
a 
small 
dimension 
of 
stem, 
and 
yet 
apt 
to 
be 
the 
foundations 
of 
great 
monarchies. 


Walled 
towns, 
stored 
arsenals 
and 
armoiies, 
goodly 
races 
of 
horse, 
chariots 
of 
war, 
elephants, 
ordnance, 
artillery, 
and 
the 
like; 
all 
this 
is 
but 
a 
sheep 
in 
a 
lion’s 
skin, 
except 
the 
breed 
and 
disposition 
of 
the 
people, 
be 
stout 
and 
warlike. 
Nay, 
number 
(itself) 
in 
armies 
importeth 
not 
much, 
where 
the 
people 
is 
of 
weak 
courage; 
for 
(as 
Virgil 
saith) 
It 
never 
troubles 
a 
wolf, 
how 
many 
the 
sheep 
be. 
The 
army 
of 
the 
Persians, 
in 
the 
plains 
of 
Arbela, 
was 
such 
a 
vast 
sea 
of 
people, 
as 
it 
did 
somewhat 
astonish 
the 
commanders 
in 
Alexander’s 
army; 
who 
came 
to 
him 
therefore, 
and 
wished 
him 
to 
set 
upon 
them 
by 
night; 
and 
he 
answered, 
He 
would 
not 
pilfer 
the 
victory. 
And 
the 
defeat 
was 
easy. 
When 
Tigranes 
the 
Armenian, 
being 
encamped 
upon 
a 
hill 
with 
four 
hundred 
thousand 
men, 
discovered 
the 
army 
of 
the 
Romans, 
being 
not 
above 
fourteen 
thousand, 
marching 
towards 
him, 
he 
made 
himself 
merry 
with 
it, 
and 
said, 
Yonder 
men 
are 
too 
many 
for 
an 
embassage, 
and 
too 
few 
for 
a 
fight. 
But 
before 
the 
sun 
set, 
he 
found 
them 
enow 
to 
give 
him 
the 
chase 
with 
infinite 
slaughter. 
Many 
are 
the 
examples 
of 
the 
great 
odds, 
between 
number 
and 
courage; 
so 
that 
a 
man 
may 
truly 
make 
a 
judgment, 
that 
the 
principal 
point 
of 
greatness 
in 
any 
state, 
is 
to 
have 
a 
race 
of 
military 
men. 
Neither 
is 
money 
the 
sinews 
of 
war 
(as 
it 
is 
trivially 
said), 
where 
the 
sinews 
of 
men’s 
arms, 
in 
base 
and 
effeminate 
people, 
are 
failing. 
For 
Solon 
said 
well 
to 
Croesus 
(when 
in 
ostentation 
he 
showed 
him 
his 
gold), 
Sir, 
if 
any 
other 
come, 
that 
hath 
better 
iron, 
than 
you, 
he 
will 
be 
master 
of 
all 
this 
gold. 
Therefore 
let 
any 
prince 
or 
state 
think 
solely 
of 
his 
forces, 
except 
his 
militia 
of 
natives 
be 
of 
good 
and 
valiant 
soldiers. 
And 
let 
princes, 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
that 
have 
subjects 
of 
martial 
disposition, 
know 
their 
own 
strength; 
unless 
they 
be 
otherwise 
wanting 
unto 
themselves. 
As 
for 
mercenary 
forces 
(which 
is 
the 
help 
in 
this 
case), 
all 
examples 
show, 
that 
whatsoever 
estate 
or 
prince 
doth 
rest 
upon 
them, 
he 
may 
spread 
his 
feathers 
for 
a 
time, 
but 
he 
will 
mew 
them 
soon 
after. 


The 
blessing 
of 
Judah 
and 
Issachar 
will 
never 
meet; 
that 
the 
same 
people, 
or 
nation, 
should 
be 
both 
the 
lion’s 
whelp 
and 
the 
ass 
between 



burthens; 
neither 
will 
it 
be, 
that 
a 
people 
overlaid 
with 
taxes, 
should 
ever 
become 
valiant 
and 
martial. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
taxes 
levied 
by 
consent 
of 
the 
estate, 
do 
abate 
men’s 
courage 
less: 
as 
it 
hath 
been 
seen 
notably, 
in 
the 
excises 
of 
the 
Low 
Countries; 
and, 
in 
some 
degree, 
in 
the 
subsidies 
of 
England. 
For 
you 
must 
note, 
that 
we 
speak 
now 
of 
the 
heart, 
and 
not 
of 
the 
purse. 
So 
that 
although 
the 
same 
tribute 
and 
tax, 
laid 
by 
consent 
or 
by 
imposing, 
be 
all 
one 
to 
the 
purse, 
yet 
it 
works 
diversely 
upon 
the 
courage. 
So 
that 
you 
may 
conclude, 
that 
no 
people 
overcharged 
with 
tribute, 
is 
fit 
for 
empire. 


Let 
states 
that 
aim 
at 
greatness, 
take 
heed 
how 
their 
nobility 
and 
gentlemen 
do 
multiply 
too 
fast. 
For 
that 
maketh 
the 
common 
subject, 
grow 
to 
be 
a 
peasant 
and 
base 
swain, 
driven 
out 
of 
heart, 
and 
in 
effect 
but 
the 
gentleman’s 
laborer. 
Even 
as 
you 
may 
see 
in 
coppice 
woods; 
if 
you 
leave 
your 
staddles 
too 
thick, 
you 
shall 
never 
have 
clean 
underwood, 
but 
shrubs 
and 
bushes. 
So 
in 
countries, 
if 
the 
gentlemen 
be 
too 
many, 
commons 
will 
be 
base; 
and 
you 
will 
bring 
it 
to 
that, 
that 
not 
the 
hundred 
poll, 
will 
be 
fit 
for 
an 
helmet; 
especially 
as 
to 
the 
infantry, 
which 
is 
the 
nerve 
of 
an 
army; 
and 
so 
there 
will 
be 
great 
population, 
and 
little 
strength. 
This 
which 
I 
speak 
of, 
hath 
been 
nowhere 
better 
seen, 
than 
by 
comparing 
of 
England 
and 
France; 
whereof 
England, 
though 
far 
less 
in 
territory 
and 
population, 
hath 
been 
(nevertheless) 
an 
overmatch; 
in 
regard 
the 
middle 
people 
of 
England 
make 
good 
soldiers, 
which 
the 
peasants 
of 
France 
do 
not. 
And 
herein 
the 
device 
of 
king 
Henry 
the 
Seventh 
(whereof 
I 
have 
spoken 
largely 
in 
the 
History 
of 
his 
Life) 
was 
profound 
and 
admirable; 
in 
making 
farms 
and 
houses 
of 
husbandry 
of 
a 
standard; 
that 
is, 
maintained 
with 
such 
a 
proportion 
of 
land 
unto 
them, 
as 
may 
breed 
a 
subject 
to 
live 
in 
convenient 
plenty 
and 
no 
servile 
condition; 
and 
to 
keep 
the 
plough 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
owners, 
and 
not 
mere 
hirelings. 
And 
thus 
indeed 
you 
shall 
attain 
to 
Virgil’s 
character 
which 
he 
gives 
to 
ancient 
Italy: 


Terra 
potens 
armis 
atque 
ubere 
glebae. 


Neither 
is 
that 
state 
(which, 
for 
any 
thing 
I 
know, 
is 
almost 
peculiar 
to 
England, 
and 
hardly 
to 
be 
found 
anywhere 
else, 
except 
it 
be 
perhaps 
in 
Poland) 
to 
be 
passed 
over; 
I 
mean 
the 
state 
of 
free 
servants, 
and 
attendants 
upon 
noblemen 
and 
gentlemen; 
which 
are 
no 
ways 
inferior 
unto 
the 
yeomanry 
for 
arms. 
And 
therefore 
out 
of 
all 
questions, 
the 
splendor 
and 



magnificence, 
and 
great 
retinues 
and 
hospitality, 
of 
noblemen 
and 
gentlemen, 
received 
into 
custom, 
doth 
much 
conduce 
unto 
martial 
greatness. 
Whereas, 
contrariwise, 
the 
close 
and 
reserved 
living 
of 
noblemen 
and 
gentlemen, 
causeth 
a 
penury 
of 
military 
forces. 


By 
all 
means 
it 
is 
to 
be 
procured, 
that 
the 
trunk 
of 
Nebuchadnezzar’s 
tree 
of 
monarchy, 
be 
great 
enough 
to 
bear 
the 
branches 
and 
the 
boughs; 
that 
is, 
that 
the 
natural 
subjects 
of 
the 
crown 
or 
state, 
bear 
a 
sufficient 
proportion 
to 
the 
stranger 
subjects, 
that 
they 
govern. 
Therefore 
all 
states 
that 
are 
liberal 
of 
naturalization 
towards 
strangers, 
are 
fit 
for 
empire. 
For 
to 
think 
that 
an 
handful 
of 
people 
can, 
with 
the 
greatest 
courage 
and 
policy 
in 
the 
world, 
embrace 
too 
large 
extent 
of 
dominion, 
it 
may 
hold 
for 
a 
time, 
but 
it 
will 
fail 
suddenly. 
The 
Spartans 
were 
a 
nice 
people 
in 
point 
of 
naturalization; 
whereby, 
while 
they 
kept 
their 
compass, 
they 
stood 
firm; 
but 
when 
they 
did 
spread, 
and 
their 
boughs 
were 
becomen 
too 
great 
for 
their 
stem, 
they 
became 
a 
windfall, 
upon 
the 
sudden. 
Never 
any 
state 
was 
in 
this 
point 
so 
open 
to 
receive 
strangers 
into 
their 
body, 
as 
were 
the 
Romans. 
Therefore 
it 
sorted 
with 
them 
accordingly; 
for 
they 
grew 
to 
the 
greatest 
monarchy. 
Their 
manner 
was 
to 
grant 
naturalization 
(which 
they 
called 
jus 
civitatis), 
and 
to 
grant 
it 
in 
the 
highest 
degree; 
that 
is, 
not 
only 
jus 
commercii, 
jus 
connubii, 
jus 
haereditatis; 
but 
also 
jus 
suffragii, 
and 
jus 
honorum. 
And 
this 
not 
to 
singular 
persons 
alone, 
but 
likewise 
to 
whole 
families; 
yea 
to 
cities, 
and 
sometimes 
to 
nations. 
Add 
to 
this 
their 
custom 
of 
plantation 
of 
colonies; 
whereby 
the 
Roman 
plant 
was 
removed 
into 
the 
soil 
of 
other 
nations. 
And 
putting 
both 
constitutions 
together, 
you 
will 
say 
that 
it 
was 
not 
the 
Romans 
that 
spread 
upon 
the 
world, 
but 
it 
was 
the 
world 
that 
spread 
upon 
the 
Romans; 
and 
that 
was 
the 
sure 
way 
of 
greatness. 
I 
have 
marvelled, 
sometimes, 
at 
Spain, 
how 
they 
clasp 
and 
contain 
so 
large 
dominions, 
with 
so 
few 
natural 
Spaniards; 
but 
sure 
the 
whole 
compass 
of 
Spain, 
is 
a 
very 
great 
body 
of 
a 
tree; 
far 
above 
Rome 
and 
Sparta 
at 
the 
first. 
And 
besides, 
though 
they 
have 
not 
had 
that 
usage, 
to 
naturalize 
liberally, 
yet 
they 
have 
that 
which 
is 
next 
to 
it; 
that 
is, 
to 
employ, 
almost 
indifferently, 
all 
nations 
in 
their 
militia 
of 
ordinary 
soldiers; 
yea, 
and 
sometimes 
in 
their 
highest 
commands. 
Nay, 
it 
seemeth 
at 
this 
instant 
they 
are 
sensible, 
of 
this 
want 
of 
natives; 
as 
by 
the 
Pragmatical 
Sanction, 
now 
published, 
appeareth. 


It 
is 
certain 
that 
sedentary, 
and 
within-door 
arts, 
and 
delicate 
manufactures 
(that 
require 
rather 
the 
finger 
than 
the 
arm), 
have, 
in 
their 



nature, 
a 
contrariety 
to 
a 
military 
disposition. 
And 
generally, 
all 
warlike 
people 
are 
a 
little 
idle, 
and 
love 
danger 
better 
than 
travail. 
Neither 
must 
they 
be 
too 
much 
broken 
of 
it, 
if 
they 
shall 
be 
preserved 
in 
vigor. 
Therefore 
it 
was 
great 
advantage, 
in 
the 
ancient 
states 
of 
Sparta, 
Athens, 
Rome, 
and 
others, 
that 
they 
had 
the 
use 
of 
slaves, 
which 
commonly 
did 
rid 
those 
manufactures. 
But 
that 
is 
abolished 
in 
greatest 
part, 
by 
the 
Christian 
law. 
That 
which 
cometh 
nearest 
to 
it, 
is 
to 
leave 
those 
arts 
chiefly 
to 
strangers 
(which, 
for 
that 
purpose, 
are 
the 
more 
easily 
to 
be 
received), 
and 
to 
contain 
the 
principal 
bulk 
of 
the 
vulgar 
natives, 
within 
those 
three 
kinds,-tillers 
of 
the 
ground; 
free 
servants; 
and 
handicraftsmen 
of 
strong 
and 
manly 
arts, 
as 
smiths, 
masons, 
carpenters, 
etc.; 
not 
reckoning 
professed 
soldiers. 


But 
above 
all, 
for 
empire 
and 
greatness, 
it 
importeth 
most, 
that 
a 
nation 
do 
profess 
arms, 
as 
their 
principal 
honor, 
study, 
and 
occupation. 
For 
the 
things 
which 
we 
formerly 
have 
spoken 
of, 
are 
but 
habilitations 
towards 
arms; 
and 
what 
is 
habilitation 
without 
intention 
and 
act? 
Romulus, 
after 
his 
death 
(as 
they 
report 
or 
feign), 
sent 
a 
present 
to 
the 
Romans, 
that 
above 
all, 
they 
should 
intend 
arms; 
and 
then 
they 
should 
prove 
the 
greatest 
empire 
of 
the 
world. 
The 
fabric 
of 
the 
state 
of 
Sparta 
was 
wholly 
(though 
not 
wisely) 
framed 
and 
composed, 
to 
that 
scope 
and 
end. 
The 
Persians 
and 
Macedonians 
had 
it 
for 
a 
flash. 
The 
Gauls, 
Germans, 
Goths, 
Saxons, 
Normans, 
and 
others, 
had 
it 
for 
a 
time. 
The 
Turks 
have 
it 
at 
this 
day, 
though 
in 
great 
declination. 
Of 
Christian 
Europe, 
they 
that 
have 
it 
are, 
in 
effect, 
only 
the 
Spaniards. 
But 
it 
is 
so 
plain, 
that 
every 
man 
profiteth 
in 
that, 
he 
most 
intendeth, 
that 
it 
needeth 
not 
to 
be 
stood 
upon. 
It 
is 
enough 
to 
point 
at 
it; 
that 
no 
nation 
which 
doth 
not 
directly 
profess 
arms, 
may 
look 
to 
have 
greatness 
fall 
into 
their 
mouths. 
And 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
it 
is 
a 
most 
certain 
oracle 
of 
time, 
that 
those 
states 
that 
continue 
long 
in 
that 
profession 
(as 
the 
Romans 
and 
Turks 
principally 
have 
done) 
do 
wonders. 
And 
those 
that 
have 
professed 
arms 
but 
for 
an 
age, 
have, 
notwithstanding, 
commonly 
attained 
that 
greatness, 
in 
that 
age, 
which 
maintained 
them 
long 
after, 
when 
their 
profession 
and 
exercise 
of 
arms 
hath 
grown 
to 
decay. 


Incident 
to 
this 
point 
is, 
for 
a 
state 
to 
have 
those 
laws 
or 
customs, 
which 
may 
reach 
forth 
unto 
them 
just 
occasions 
(as 
may 
be 
pretended) 
of 
war. 
For 
there 
is 
that 
justice, 
imprinted 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
men, 
that 
they 
enter 
not 
upon 
wars 
(whereof 
so 
many 
calamities 
do 
ensue) 
but 
upon 
some, 
at 
the 
least 
specious, 
grounds 
and 
quarrels. 
The 
Turk 
hath 
at 
hand, 
for 
cause 
of 
war, 



the 
propagation 
of 
his 
law 
or 
sect; 
a 
quarrel 
that 
he 
may 
always 
command. 
The 
Romans, 
though 
they 
esteemed 
the 
extending 
the 
limits 
of 
their 
empire, 
to 
be 
great 
honor 
to 
their 
generals, 
when 
it 
was 
done, 
yet 
they 
never 
rested 
upon 
that 
alone, 
to 
begin 
a 
war. 
First, 
therefore, 
let 
nations 
that 
pretend 
to 
greatness 
have 
this; 
that 
they 
be 
sensible 
of 
wrongs, 
either 
upon 
borderers, 
merchants, 
or 
politic 
ministers; 
and 
that 
they 
sit 
not 
too 
long 
upon 
a 
provocation. 
Secondly, 
let 
them 
be 
prest, 
and 
ready 
to 
give 
aids 
and 
succors, 
to 
their 
confederates; 
as 
it 
ever 
was 
with 
the 
Romans; 
insomuch, 
as 
if 
the 
confederate 
had 
leagues 
defensive, 
with 
divers 
other 
states, 
and, 
upon 
invasion 
offered, 
did 
implore 
their 
aids 
severally, 
yet 
the 
Romans 
would 
ever 
be 
the 
foremost, 
and 
leave 
it 
to 
none 
other 
to 
have 
the 
honor. 
As 
for 
the 
wars 
which 
were 
anciently 
made, 
on 
the 
behalf 
of 
a 
kind 
of 
party, 
or 
tacit 
conformity 
of 
estate, 
I 
do 
not 
see 
how 
they 
may 
be 
well 
justified: 
as 
when 
the 
Romans 
made 
a 
war, 
for 
the 
liberty 
of 
Grecia; 
or 
when 
the 
Lacedaemonians 
and 
Athenians, 
made 
wars 
to 
set 
up 
or 
pull 
down 
democracies 
and 
oligarchies; 
or 
when 
wars 
were 
made 
by 
foreigners, 
under 
the 
pretence 
of 
justice 
or 
protection, 
to 
deliver 
the 
subjects 
of 
others, 
from 
tyranny 
and 
oppression; 
and 
the 
like. 
Let 
it 
suffice, 
that 
no 
estate 
expect 
to 
be 
great, 
that 
is 
not 
awake 
upon 
any 
just 
occasion 
of 
arming. 


No 
body 
can 
be 
healthful 
without 
exercise, 
neither 
natural 
body 
nor 
politic; 
and 
certainly 
to 
a 
kingdom 
or 
estate, 
a 
just 
and 
honorable 
war, 
is 
the 
true 
exercise. 
A 
civil 
war, 
indeed, 
is 
like 
the 
heat 
of 
a 
fever; 
but 
a 
foreign 
war 
is 
like 
the 
heat 
of 
exercise, 
and 
serveth 
to 
keep 
the 
body 
in 
health; 
for 
in 
a 
slothful 
peace, 
both 
courages 
will 
effeminate, 
and 
manners 
corrupt. 
But 
howsoever 
it 
be 
for 
happiness, 
without 
all 
question, 
for 
greatness, 
it 
maketh 
to 
be 
still 
for 
the 
most 
part 
in 
arms; 
and 
the 
strength 
of 
a 
veteran 
army 
(though 
it 
be 
a 
chargeable 
business) 
always 
on 
foot, 
is 
that 
which 
commonly 
giveth 
the 
law, 
or 
at 
least 
the 
reputation, 
amongst 
all 
neighbor 
states; 
as 
may 
well 
be 
seen 
in 
Spain, 
which 
hath 
had, 
in 
one 
part 
or 
other, 
a 
veteran 
army 
almost 
continually, 
now 
by 
the 
space 
of 
six 
score 
years. 


To 
be 
master 
of 
the 
sea, 
is 
an 
abridgment 
of 
a 
monarchy. 
Cicero, 
writing 
to 
Atticus 
of 
Pompey 
his 
preparation 
against 
Caesar, 
saith, 
Consilium 
Pompeii 
plane 
Themistocleum 
est; 
putat 
enim, 
qui 
mari 
potitur, 
eum 
rerum 
potiri. 
And, 
without 
doubt, 
Pompey 
had 
tired 
out 
Caesar, 
if 
upon 
vain 
confidence, 
he 
had 
not 
left 
that 
way. 
We 
see 
the 
great 
effects 
of 
battles 
by 
sea. 
The 
battle 
of 
Actium, 
decided 
the 
empire 
of 
the 
world. 
The 
battle 
of 



Lepanto, 
arrested 
the 
greatness 
of 
the 
Turk. 
There 
be 
many 
examples, 
where 
sea-fights 
have 
been 
final 
to 
the 
war; 
but 
this 
is 
when 
princes 
or 
states 
have 
set 
up 
their 
rest, 
upon 
the 
battles. 
But 
thus 
much 
is 
certain, 
that 
he 
that 
commands 
the 
seal 
is 
at 
great 
liberty, 
and 
may 
take 
as 
much, 
and 
as 
little, 
of 
the 
war 
as 
he 
will. 
Whereas 
those 
that 
be 
strongest 
by 
land, 
are 
many 
times 
nevertheless 
in 
great 
straits. 
Surely, 
at 
this 
day, 
with 
us 
of 
Europe, 
the 
vantage 
of 
strength 
at 
sea 
(which 
is 
one 
of 
the 
principal 
dowries 
of 
this 
kingdom 
of 
Great 
Britain) 
is 
great; 
both 
because 
most 
of 
the 
kingdoms 
of 
Europe, 
are 
not 
merely 
inland, 
but 
girt 
with 
the 
sea 
most 
part 
of 
their 
compass; 
and 
because 
the 
wealth 
of 
both 
Indies 
seems 
in 
great 
part, 
but 
an 
accessory 
to 
the 
command 
of 
the 
seas. 


The 
wars 
of 
latter 
ages 
seem 
to 
be 
made 
in 
the 
dark, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
glory, 
and 
honor, 
which 
reflected 
upon 
men 
from 
the 
wars, 
in 
ancient 
time. 
There 
be 
now, 
for 
martial 
encouragement, 
some 
degrees 
and 
orders 
of 
chivalry; 
which 
nevertheless 
are 
conferred 
promiscuously, 
upon 
soldiers 
and 
no 
soldiers; 
and 
some 
remembrance 
perhaps, 
upon 
the 
scutcheon; 
and 
some 
hospitals 
for 
maimed 
soldiers; 
and 
such 
like 
things. 
But 
in 
ancient 
times, 
the 
trophies 
erected 
upon 
the 
place 
of 
the 
victory; 
the 
funeral 
laudatives 
and 
monuments 
for 
those 
that 
died 
in 
the 
wars; 
the 
crowns 
and 
garlands 
personal; 
the 
style 
of 
emperor, 
which 
the 
great 
kings 
of 
the 
world 
after 
borrowed; 
the 
triumphs 
of 
the 
generals, 
upon 
their 
return; 
the 
great 
donatives 
and 
largesses, 
upon 
the 
disbanding 
of 
the 
armies; 
were 
things 
able 
to 
inflame 
all 
men’s 
courages. 
But 
above 
all, 
that 
of 
the 
triumph, 
amongst 
the 
Romans, 
was 
not 
pageants 
or 
gaudery, 
but 
one 
of 
the 
wisest 
and 
noblest 
institutions, 
that 
ever 
was. 
For 
it 
contained 
three 
things: 
honor 
to 
the 
general; 
riches 
to 
the 
treasury 
out 
of 
the 
spoils; 
and 
donatives 
to 
the 
army. 
But 
that 
honor, 
perhaps 
were 
not 
fit 
for 
monarchies; 
except 
it 
be 
in 
the 
person 
of 
the 
monarch 
himself, 
or 
his 
sons; 
as 
it 
came 
to 
pass 
in 
the 
times 
of 
the 
Roman 
emperors, 
who 
did 
impropriate 
the 
actual 
triumphs 
to 
themselves, 
and 
their 
sons, 
for 
such 
wars 
as 
they 
did 
achieve 
in 
person; 
and 
left 
only, 
for 
wars 
achieved 
by 
subjects, 
some 
triumphal 
garments 
and 
ensigns 
to 
the 
general. 


To 
conclude: 
no 
man 
can 
by 
care 
taking 
(as 
the 
Scripture 
saith) 
add 
a 
cubit 
to 
his 
stature, 
in 
this 
little 
model 
of 
a 
man’s 
body; 
but 
in 
the 
great 
frame 
of 
kingdoms 
and 
commonwealths, 
it 
is 
in 
the 
power 
of 
princes 
or 
estates, 
to 
add 
amplitude 
and 
greatness 
to 
their 
kingdoms; 
for 
by 
introducing 
such 
ordinances, 
constitutions, 
and 
customs, 
as 
we 
have 
now 
touched, 
they 
may 



sow 
greatness 
to 
their 
posterity 
and 
succession. 
But 
these 
things 
are 
commonly 
not 
observed, 
but 
left 
to 
take 
their 
chance. 



OF 
REGIMENT 
OF 
HEALTH 


There 
is 
a 
wisdom 
in 
this; 
beyond 
the 
rules 
of 
physic: 
a 
man’s 
own 
observation, 
what 
he 
finds 
good 
of, 
and 
what 
he 
finds 
hurt 
of, 
is 
the 
best 
physic 
to 
preserve 
health. 
But 
it 
is 
a 
safer 
conclusion 
to 
say, 
This 
agreeth 
not 
well 
with 
me, 
therefore, 
I 
will 
not 
continue 
it; 
than 
this, 
I 
find 
no 
offence 
of 
this, 
therefore 
I 
may 
use 
it. 
For 
strength 
of 
nature 
in 
youth, 
passeth 
over 
many 
excesses, 
which 
are 
owing 
a 
man 
till 
his 
age. 
Discern 
of 
the 
coming 
on 
of 
years, 
and 
think 
not 
to 
do 
the 
same 
things 
still; 
for 
age 
will 
not 
be 
defied. 
Beware 
of 
sudden 
change, 
in 
any 
great 
point 
of 
diet, 
and, 
if 
necessity 
inforce 
it, 
fit 
the 
rest 
to 
it. 
For 
it 
is 
a 
secret 
both 
in 
nature 
and 
state, 
that 
it 
is 
safer 
to 
change 
many 
things, 
than 
one. 
Examine 
thy 
customs 
of 
diet, 
sleep, 
exercise, 
apparel, 
and 
the 
like; 
and 
try, 
in 
any 
thing 
thou 
shalt 
judge 
hurtful, 
to 
discontinue 
it, 
by 
little 
and 
little; 
but 
so, 
as 
if 
thou 
dost 
find 
any 
inconvenience 
by 
the 
change, 
thou 
come 
back 
to 
it 
again: 
for 
it 
is 
hard 
to 
distinguish 
that 
which 
is 
generally 
held 
good 
and 
wholesome, 
from 
that 
which 
is 
good 
particularly, 
and 
fit 
for 
thine 
own 
body. 
To 
be 
free-minded 
and 
cheerfully 
disposed, 
at 
hours 
of 
meat, 
and 
of 
sleep, 
and 
of 
exercise, 
is 
one 
of 
the 
best 
precepts 
of 
long 
lasting. 
As 
for 
the 
passions, 
and 
studies 
of 
the 
mind; 
avoid 
envy, 
anxious 
fears; 
anger 
fretting 
inwards; 
subtle 
and 
knotty 
inquisitions; 
joys 
and 
exhilarations 
in 
excess; 
sadness 
not 
communicated. 
Entertain 
hopes; 
mirth 
rather 
than 
joy; 
variety 
of 
delights, 
rather 
than 
surfeit 
of 
them; 
wonder 
and 
admiration, 
and 
therefore 
novelties; 
studies 
that 
fill 
the 
mind 
with 
splendid 
and 
illustrious 
objects, 
as 
histories, 
fables, 
and 
contemplations 
of 
nature. 
If 
you 
fly 
physic 
in 
health 
altogether, 
it 
will 
be 
too 
strange 
for 
your 
body, 
when 
you 
shall 
need 
it. 
If 
you 
make 
it 
too 
familiar, 
it 
will 
work 
no 
extraordinary 
effect, 
when 
sickness 
cometh. 
I 
commend 
rather 
some 
diet 
for 
certain 
seasons, 
than 
frequent 
use 
of 
physic, 
except 
it 
be 
grown 
into 
a 
custom. 
For 
those 
diets 
alter 
the 
body 
more, 
and 
trouble 
it 
less. 
Despise 
no 
new 
accident 
in 
your 
body, 
but 
ask 
opinion 
of 
it. 
In 
sickness, 
respect 
health 
principally; 
and 
in 
health, 
action. 
For 
those 
that 
put 
their 
bodies 
to 
endure 
in 
health, 
may 
in 
most 
sicknesses, 
which 
are 
not 
very 
sharp, 
be 
cured 
only 
with 
diet, 
and 
tendering. 
Celsus 
could 
never 
have 
spoken 
it 
as 
a 
physician, 
had 
he 
not 
been 
a 
wise 
man 
withal, 
when 
he 
giveth 
it 
for 
one 
of 



the 
great 
precepts 
of 
health 
and 
lasting, 
that 
a 
man 
do 
vary, 
and 
interchange 
contraries, 
but 
with 
an 
inclination 
to 
the 
more 
benign 
extreme: 
use 
fasting 
and 
full 
eating, 
but 
rather 
full 
eating; 
watching 
and 
sleep, 
but 
rather 
sleep; 
sitting 
and 
exercise, 
but 
rather 
exercise; 
and 
the 
like. 
So 
shall 
nature 
be 
cherished, 
and 
yet 
taught 
masteries. 
Physicians 
are, 
some 
of 
them, 
so 
pleasing 
and 
conformable 
to 
the 
humor 
of 
the 
patient, 
as 
they 
press 
not 
the 
true 
cure 
of 
the 
disease; 
and 
some 
other 
are 
so 
regular, 
in 
proceeding 
according 
to 
art 
for 
the 
disease, 
as 
they 
respect 
not 
sufficiently 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
patient. 
Take 
one 
of 
a 
middle 
temper; 
or 
if 
it 
may 
not 
be 
found 
in 
one 
man, 
combine 
two 
of 
either 
sort; 
and 
forget 
not 
to 
call 
as 
well, 
the 
best 
acquainted 
with 
your 
body, 
as 
the 
best 
reputed 
of 
for 
his 
faculty. 



OF 
SUSPICION 


Suspicions 
amongst 
thoughts, 
are 
like 
bats 
amongst 
birds, 
they 
ever 
fly 
by 
twilight. 
Certainly 
they 
are 
to 
be 
repressed, 
or 
at 
least 
well 
guarded: 
for 
they 
cloud 
the 
mind; 
they 
leese 
friends; 
and 
they 
check 
with 
business, 
whereby 
business 
cannot 
go 
on 
currently 
and 
constantly. 
They 
dispose 
kings 
to 
tyranny, 
husbands 
to 
jealousy, 
wise 
men 
to 
irresolution 
and 
melancholy. 
They 
are 
defects, 
not 
in 
the 
heart, 
but 
in 
the 
brain; 
for 
they 
take 
place 
in 
the 
stoutest 
natures; 
as 
in 
the 
example 
of 
Henry 
the 
Seventh 
of 
England. 
There 
was 
not 
a 
more 
suspicious 
man, 
nor 
a 
more 
stout. 
And 
in 
such 
a 
composition 
they 
do 
small 
hurt. 
For 
commonly 
they 
are 
not 
admitted, 
but 
with 
examination, 
whether 
they 
be 
likely 
or 
no. 
But 
in 
fearful 
natures 
they 
gain 
ground 
too 
fast. 
There 
is 
nothing 
makes 
a 
man 
suspect 
much, 
more 
than 
to 
know 
little; 
and 
therefore 
men 
should 
remedy 
suspicion, 
by 
procuring 
to 
know 
more, 
and 
not 
to 
keep 
their 
suspicions 
in 
smother. 
What 
would 
men 
have? 
Do 
they 
think, 
those 
they 
employ 
and 
deal 
with, 
are 
saints? 
Do 
they 
not 
think, 
they 
will 
have 
their 
own 
ends, 
and 
be 
truer 
to 
themselves, 
than 
to 
them? 
Therefore 
there 
is 
no 
better 
way, 
to 
moderate 
suspicions, 
than 
to 
account 
upon 
such 
suspicions 
as 
true, 
and 
yet 
to 
bridle 
them 
as 
false. 
For 
so 
far 
a 
man 
ought 
to 
make 
use 
of 
suspicions, 
as 
to 
provide, 
as 
if 
that 
should 
be 
true, 
that 
he 
suspects, 
yet 
it 
may 
do 
him 
no 
hurt. 
Suspicions 
that 
the 
mind 
of 
itself 
gathers, 
are 
but 
buzzes; 
but 
suspicions 
that 
are 
artificially 
nourished, 
and 
put 
into 
men’s 
heads, 
by 
the 
tales 
and 
whisperings 
of 
others, 
have 
stings. 
Certainly, 
the 
best 
mean, 
to 
clear 
the 
way 
in 
this 
same 
wood 
of 
suspicions, 
is 
frankly 
to 
communicate 
them 
with 
the 
party, 
that 
he 
suspects; 
for 
thereby 
he 
shall 
be 
sure 
to 
know 
more 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
them, 
than 
he 
did 
before; 
and 
withal 
shall 
make 
that 
party 
more 
circumspect, 
not 
to 
give 
further 
cause 
of 
suspicion. 
But 
this 
would 
not 
be 
done 
to 
men 
of 
base 
natures; 
for 
they, 
if 
they 
find 
themselves 
once 
suspected, 
will 
never 
be 
true. 
The 
Italian 
says, 
Sospetto 
licentia 
fede; 
as 
if 
suspicion, 
did 
give 
a 
passport 
to 
faith; 
but 
it 
ought, 
rather, 
to 
kindle 
it 
to 
discharge 
itself. 



 
OF 
DISCOURSE 


Some 
in 
their 
discourse, 
desire 
rather 
commendation 
of 
wit, 
in 
being 
able 
to 
hold 
all 
arguments, 
than 
of 
judgment, 
in 
discerning 
what 
is 
true; 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
praise, 
to 
know 
what 
might 
be 
said, 
and 
not, 
what 
should 
be 
thought. 
Some 
have 
certain 
common 
places, 
and 
themes, 
wherein 
they 
are 
good, 
and 
want 
variety; 
which 
kind 
of 
poverty 
is 
for 
the 
most 
part 
tedious, 
and 
when 
it 
is 
once 
perceived, 
ridiculous. 
The 
honorablest 
part 
of 
talk, 
is 
to 
give 
the 
occasion; 
and 
again 
to 
moderate, 
and 
pass 
to 
somewhat 
else; 
for 
then 
a 
man 
leads 
the 
dance. 
It 
is 
good, 
in 
discourse 
and 
speech 
of 
conversation, 
to 
vary 
and 
intermingle 
speech 
of 
the 
present 
occasion, 
with 
arguments, 
tales 
with 
reasons, 
asking 
of 
questions, 
with 
telling 
of 
opinions, 
and 
jest 
with 
earnest: 
for 
it 
is 
a 
dull 
thing 
to 
tire, 
and, 
as 
we 
say 
now, 
to 
jade, 
any 
thing 
too 
far. 
As 
for 
jest, 
there 
be 
certain 
things, 
which 
ought 
to 
be 
privileged 
from 
it; 
namely, 
religion, 
matters 
of 
state, 
great 
persons, 
any 
man’s 
present 
business 
of 
importance, 
and 
any 
case 
that 
deserveth 
pity. 
Yet 
there 
be 
some, 
that 
think 
their 
wits 
have 
been 
asleep, 
except 
they 
dart 
out 
somewhat 
that 
is 
piquant, 
and 
to 
the 
quick. 
That 
is 
a 
vein 
which 
would 
be 
bridled: 


Parce, 
puer, 
stimulis, 
et 
fortius 
utere 
loris. 


And 
generally, 
men 
ought 
to 
find 
the 
difference, 
between 
saltness 
and 
bitterness. 
Certainly, 
he 
that 
hath 
a 
satirical 
vein, 
as 
he 
maketh 
others 
afraid 
of 
his 
wit, 
so 
he 
had 
need 
be 
afraid 
of 
others’ 
memory. 
He 
that 
questioneth 
much, 
shall 
learn 
much, 
and 
content 
much; 
but 
especially, 
if 
he 
apply 
his 
questions 
to 
the 
skill 
of 
the 
persons 
whom 
he 
asketh; 
for 
he 
shall 
give 
them 
occasion, 
to 
please 
themselves 
in 
speaking, 
and 
himself 
shall 
continually 
gather 
knowledge. 
But 
let 
his 
questions 
not 
be 
troublesome; 
for 
that 
is 
fit 
for 
a 
poser. 
And 
let 
him 
be 
sure 
to 
leave 
other 
men, 
their 
turns 
to 
speak. 
Nay, 
if 
there 
be 
any, 
that 
would 
reign 
and 
take 
up 
all 
the 
time, 
let 
him 
find 
means 
to 
take 
them 
off, 
and 
to 
bring 
others 
on; 
as 
musicians 
use 
to 
do, 
with 
those 
that 
dance 
too 
long 
galliards. 
If 
you 
dissemble, 
sometimes, 
your 
knowledge 
of 
that 
you 
are 
thought 
to 
know, 
you 
shall 
be 
thought, 
another 
time, 
to 
know 
that 
you 
know 
not. 
Speech 
of 
a 
man’s 
self 
ought 
to 
be 
seldom, 



and 
well 
chosen. 
I 
knew 
one, 
was 
wont 
to 
say 
in 
scorn, 
He 
must 
needs 
be 
a 
wise 
man, 
he 
speaks 
so 
much 
of 
himself: 
and 
there 
is 
but 
one 
case, 
wherein 
a 
man 
may 
commend 
himself 
with 
good 
grace; 
and 
that 
is 
in 
commending 
virtue 
in 
another; 
especially 
if 
it 
be 
such 
a 
virtue, 
whereunto 
himself 
pretendeth. 
Speech 
of 
touch 
towards 
others, 
should 
be 
sparingly 
used; 
for 
discourse 
ought 
to 
be 
as 
a 
field, 
without 
coming 
home 
to 
any 
man. 
I 
knew 
two 
noblemen, 
of 
the 
west 
part 
of 
England, 
whereof 
the 
one 
was 
given 
to 
scoff, 
but 
kept 
ever 
royal 
cheer 
in 
his 
house; 
the 
other 
would 
ask, 
of 
those 
that 
had 
been 
at 
the 
other’s 
table, 
Tell 
truly, 
was 
there 
never 
a 
flout 
or 
dry 
blow 
given? 
To 
which 
the 
guest 
would 
answer, 
Such 
and 
such 
a 
thing 
passed. 
The 
lord 
would 
say, 
I 
thought, 
he 
would 
mar 
a 
good 
dinner. 
Discretion 
of 
speech, 
is 
more 
than 
eloquence; 
and 
to 
speak 
agreeably 
to 
him, 
with 
whom 
we 
deal, 
is 
more 
than 
to 
speak 
in 
good 
words, 
or 
in 
good 
order. 
A 
good 
continued 
speech, 
without 
a 
good 
speech 
of 
interlocution, 
shows 
slowness: 
and 
a 
good 
reply 
or 
second 
speech, 
without 
a 
good 
settled 
speech, 
showeth 
shallowness 
and 
weakness. 
As 
we 
see 
in 
beasts, 
that 
those 
that 
are 
weakest 
in 
the 
course, 
are 
yet 
nimblest 
in 
the 
turn; 
as 
it 
is 
betwixt 
the 
greyhound 
and 
the 
hare. 
To 
use 
too 
many 
circumstances, 
ere 
one 
come 
to 
the 
matter, 
is 
wearisome; 
to 
use 
none 
at 
all, 
is 
blunt. 



OF 
PLANTATIONS 


Plantations 
are 
amongst 
ancient, 
primitive, 
and 
heroical 
works. 
When 
the 
world 
was 
young, 
it 
begat 
more 
children; 
but 
now 
it 
is 
old, 
it 
begets 
fewer: 
for 
I 
may 
justly 
account 
new 
plantations, 
to 
be 
the 
children 
of 
former 
kingdoms. 
I 
like 
a 
plantation 
in 
a 
pure 
soil; 
that 
is, 
where 
people 
are 
not 
displanted, 
to 
the 
end, 
to 
plant 
in 
others. 
For 
else 
it 
is 
rather 
an 
extirpation, 
than 
a 
plantation. 
Planting 
of 
countries, 
is 
like 
planting 
of 
woods; 
for 
you 
must 
make 
account 
to 
leese 
almost 
twenty 
years’profit, 
and 
expect 
your 
recompense 
in 
the 
end. 
For 
the 
principal 
thing, 
that 
hath 
been 
the 
destruction 
of 
most 
plantations, 
hath 
been 
the 
base 
and 
hasty 
drawing 
of 
profit, 
in 
the 
first 
years. 
It 
is 
true, 
speedy 
profit 
is 
not 
to 
be 
neglected, 
as 
far 
as 
may 
stand 
with 
the 
good 
of 
the 
plantation, 
but 
no 
further. 
It 
is 
a 
shameful 
and 
unblessed 
thing, 
to 
take 
the 
scum 
of 
people, 
and 
wicked 
condemned 
men, 
to 
be 
the 
people 
with 
whom 
you 
plant; 
and 
not 
only 
so, 
but 
it 
spoileth 
the 
plantation; 
for 
they 
will 
ever 
live 
like 
rogues, 
and 
not 
fall 
to 
work, 
but 
be 
lazy, 
and 
do 
mischief, 
and 
spend 
victuals, 
and 
be 
quickly 
weary, 
and 
then 
certify 
over 
to 
their 
country, 
to 
the 
discredit 
of 
the 
plantation. 
The 
people 
wherewith 
you 
plant 
ought 
to 
be 
gardeners, 
ploughmen, 
laborers, 
smiths, 
carpenters, 
joiners, 
fishermen, 
fowlers, 
with 
some 
few 
apothecaries, 
surgeons, 
cooks, 
and 
bakers. 
In 
a 
country 
of 
plantation, 
first 
look 
about, 
what 
kind 
of 
victual 
the 
country 
yields 
of 
itself 
to 
hand; 
as 
chestnuts, 
walnuts, 
pineapples, 
olives, 
dates, 
plums, 
cherries, 
wild 
honey, 
and 
the 
like; 
and 
make 
use 
of 
them. 
Then 
consider 
what 
victual 
or 
esculent 
things 
there 
are, 
which 
grow 
speedily, 
and 
within 
the 
year; 
as 
parsnips, 
carrots, 
turnips, 
onions, 
radish, 
artichokes 
of 
Hierusalem, 
maize, 
and 
the 
like. 
For 
wheat, 
barley, 
and 
oats, 
they 
ask 
too 
much 
labor; 
but 
with 
pease 
and 
beans 
you 
may 
begin, 
both 
because 
they 
ask 
less 
labor, 
and 
because 
they 
serve 
for 
meat, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
bread. 
And 
of 
rice, 
likewise 
cometh 
a 
great 
increase, 
and 
it 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
meat. 
Above 
all, 
there 
ought 
to 
be 
brought 
store 
of 
biscuit, 
oat-meal, 
flour, 
meal, 
and 
the 
like, 
in 
the 
beginning, 
till 
bread 
may 
be 
had. 
For 
beasts, 
or 
birds, 
take 
chiefly 
such 
as 
are 
least 
subject 
to 
diseases, 
and 
multiply 
fastest; 
as 
swine, 
goats, 
cocks, 
hens, 
turkeys, 
geese, 
house-doves, 
and 
the 
like. 
The 
victual 
in 
plantations, 
ought 
to 
be 
expended 
almost 
as 
in 
a 
besieged 
town; 
that 
is, 
with 
certain 
allowance. 
And 
let 
the 
main 
part 
of 
the 
ground, 
employed 
to 
gardens 
or 
corn, 
be 
to 
a 



common 
stock; 
and 
to 
be 
laid 
in, 
and 
stored 
up, 
and 
then 
delivered 
out 
in 
proportion; 
besides 
some 
spots 
of 
ground, 
that 
any 
particular 
person 
will 
manure 
for 
his 
own 
private. 
Consider 
likewise 
what 
commodities, 
the 
soil 
where 
the 
plantation 
is, 
doth 
naturally 
yield, 
that 
they 
may 
some 
way 
help 
to 
defray 
the 
charge 
of 
the 
plantation 
(so 
it 
be 
not, 
as 
was 
said, 
to 
the 
untimely 
prejudice 
of 
the 
main 
business), 
as 
it 
hath 
fared 
with 
tobacco 
in 
Virginia. 
Wood 
commonly 
aboundeth 
but 
too 
much; 
and 
therefore 
timber 
is 
fit 
to 
be 
one. 
If 
there 
be 
iron 
ore, 
and 
streams 
whereupon 
to 
set 
the 
mills, 
iron 
is 
a 
brave 
commodity 
where 
wood 
aboundeth. 
Making 
of 
bay-salt, 
if 
the 
climate 
be 
proper 
for 
it, 
would 
be 
put 
in 
experience. 
Growing 
silk 
likewise, 
if 
any 
be, 
is 
a 
likely 
commodity. 
Pitch 
and 
tar, 
where 
store 
of 
firs 
and 
pines 
are, 
will 
not 
fail. 
So 
drugs 
and 
sweet 
woods, 
where 
they 
are, 
cannot 
but 
yield 
great 
profit. 
Soap-ashes 
likewise, 
and 
other 
things 
that 
may 
be 
thought 
of. 
But 
moil 
not 
too 
much 
under 
ground; 
for 
the 
hope 
of 
mines 
is 
very 
uncertain, 
and 
useth 
to 
make 
the 
planters 
lazy, 
in 
other 
things. 
For 
government, 
let 
it 
be 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
one, 
assisted 
with 
some 
counsel; 
and 
let 
them 
have 
commission 
to 
exercise 
martial 
laws, 
with 
some 
limitation. 
And 
above 
all, 
let 
men 
make 
that 
profit, 
of 
being 
in 
the 
wilderness, 
as 
they 
have 
God 
always, 
and 
his 
service, 
before 
their 
eyes. 
Let 
not 
the 
government 
of 
the 
plantation, 
depend 
upon 
too 
many 
counsellors, 
and 
undertakers, 
in 
the 
country 
that 
planteth, 
but 
upon 
a 
temperate 
number; 
and 
let 
those 
be 
rather 
noblemen 
and 
gentlemen, 
than 
merchants; 
for 
they 
look 
ever 
to 
the 
present 
gain. 
Let 
there 
be 
freedom 
from 
custom, 
till 
the 
plantation 
be 
of 
strength; 
and 
not 
only 
freedom 
from 
custom, 
but 
freedom 
to 
carry 
their 
commodities, 
where 
they 
may 
make 
their 
best 
of 
them, 
except 
there 
be 
some 
special 
cause 
of 
caution. 
Cram 
not 
in 
people, 
by 
sending 
too 
fast 
company 
after 
company; 
but 
rather 
harken 
how 
they 
waste, 
and 
send 
supplies 
proportionably; 
but 
so, 
as 
the 
number 
may 
live 
well 
in 
the 
plantation, 
and 
not 
by 
surcharge 
be 
in 
penury. 
It 
hath 
been 
a 
great 
endangering 
to 
the 
health 
of 
some 
plantations, 
that 
they 
have 
built 
along 
the 
sea 
and 
rivers, 
in 
marish 
and 
unwholesome 
grounds. 
Therefore, 
though 
you 
begin 
there, 
to 
avoid 
carriage 
and 
like 
discommodities, 
yet 
build 
still 
rather 
upwards 
from 
the 
streams, 
than 
along. 
It 
concerneth 
likewise 
the 
health 
of 
the 
plantation, 
that 
they 
have 
good 
store 
of 
salt 
with 
them, 
that 
they 
may 
use 
it 
in 
their 
victuals, 
when 
it 
shall 
be 
necessary. 
If 
you 
plant 
where 
savages 
are, 
do 
not 
only 
entertain 
them, 
with 
trifles 
and 
gingles, 
but 
use 
them 
justly 
and 
graciously, 
with 
sufficient 
guard 
nevertheless; 
and 
do 
not 
win 
their 
favor, 
by 
helping 
them 
to 
invade 
their 
enemies, 
but 
for 
their 
defence 
it 
is 
not 
amiss; 
and 



send 
oft 
of 
them, 
over 
to 
the 
country 
that 
plants, 
that 
they 
may 
see 
a 
better 
condition 
than 
their 
own, 
and 
commend 
it 
when 
they 
return. 
When 
the 
plantation 
grows 
to 
strength, 
then 
it 
is 
time 
to 
plant 
with 
women, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
men; 
that 
the 
plantation 
may 
spread 
into 
generations, 
and 
not 
be 
ever 
pieced 
from 
without. 
It 
is 
the 
sinfullest 
thing 
in 
the 
world, 
to 
forsake 
or 
destitute 
a 
plantation 
once 
in 
forwardness; 
for 
besides 
the 
dishonor, 
it 
is 
the 
guiltiness 
of 
blood 
of 
many 
commiserable 
persons. 



OF 
RICHES 


I 
cannot 
call 
riches 
better 
than 
the 
baggage 
of 
virtue. 
The 
Roman 
word 
is 
better, 
impedimenta. 
For 
as 
the 
baggage 
is 
to 
an 
army, 
so 
is 
riches 
to 
virtue. 
It 
cannot 
be 
spared, 
nor 
left 
behind, 
but 
it 
hindereth 
the 
march; 
yea, 
and 
the 
care 
of 
it, 
sometimes 
loseth 
or 
disturbeth 
the 
victory. 
Of 
great 
riches 
there 
is 
no 
real 
use, 
except 
it 
be 
in 
the 
distribution; 
the 
rest 
is 
but 
conceit. 
So 
saith 
Solomon, 
Where 
much 
is, 
there 
are 
many 
consume 
it; 
and 
what 
hath 
the 
owner, 
but 
the 
sight 
of 
it 
with 
his 
eyes? 
The 
personal 
fruition 
in 
any 
man, 
cannot 
reach 
to 
feel 
great 
riches: 
there 
is 
a 
custody 
of 
them; 
or 
a 
power 
of 
dole, 
and 
donative 
of 
them; 
or 
a 
fame 
of 
them; 
but 
no 
solid 
use 
to 
the 
owner. 
Do 
you 
not 
see 
what 
feigned 
prices, 
are 
set 
upon 
little 
stones 
and 
rarities? 
and 
what 
works 
of 
ostentation 
are 
undertaken, 
because 
there 
might 
seem 
to 
be 
some 
use 
of 
great 
riches? 
But 
then 
you 
will 
say, 
they 
may 
be 
of 
use, 
to 
buy 
men 
out 
of 
dangers 
or 
troubles. 
As 
Solomon 
saith, 
Riches 
are 
as 
a 
strong 
hold, 
in 
the 
imagination 
of 
the 
rich 
man. 
But 
this 
is 
excellently 
expressed, 
that 
it 
is 
in 
imagination, 
and 
not 
always 
in 
fact. 
For 
certainly 
great 
riches, 
have 
sold 
more 
men, 
than 
they 
have 
bought 
out. 
Seek 
not 
proud 
riches, 
but 
such 
as 
thou 
mayest 
get 
justly, 
use 
soberly, 
distribute 
cheerfully, 
and 
leave 
contentedly. 
Yet 
have 
no 
abstract 
nor 
friarly 
contempt 
of 
them. 
But 
distinguish, 
as 
Cicero 
saith 
well 
of 
Rabirius 
Posthumus, 
In 
studio 
rei 
amplificandae 
apparebat, 
non 
avaritiae 
praedam, 
sed 
instrumentum 
bonitati 
quaeri. 
Harken 
also 
to 
Solomon, 
and 
beware 
of 
hasty 
gathering 
of 
riches; 
Qui 
festinat 
ad 
divitias, 
non 
erit 
insons. 
The 
poets 
feign, 
that 
when 
Plutus 
(which 
is 
Riches) 
is 
sent 
from 
Jupiter, 
he 
limps 
and 
goes 
slowly; 
but 
when 
he 
is 
sent 
from 
Pluto, 
he 
runs, 
and 
is 
swift 
of 
foot. 
Meaning 
that 
riches 
gotten 
by 
good 
means, 
and 
just 
labor, 
pace 
slowly; 
but 
when 
they 
come 
by 
the 
death 
of 
others 
(as 
by 
the 
course 
of 
inheritance, 
testaments, 
and 
the 
like), 
they 
come 
tumbling 
upon 
a 
man. 
But 
it 
mought 
be 
applied 
likewise 
to 
Pluto, 
taking 
him 
for 
the 
devil. 
For 
when 
riches 
come 
from 
the 
devil 
(as 
by 
fraud 
and 
oppression, 
and 
unjust 
means), 
they 
come 
upon 
speed. 
The 
ways 
to 
enrich 
are 
many, 
and 
most 
of 
them 
foul. 
Parsimony 
is 
one 
of 
the 
best, 
and 
yet 
is 
not 
innocent; 
for 
it 
withholdeth 
men 
from 
works 
of 
liberality 
and 
charity. 
The 
improvement 
of 
the 
ground, 
is 
the 
most 
natural 
obtaining 
of 
riches; 
for 
it 
is 
our 
great 
mother’s 
blessing, 
the 
earth’s; 
but 
it 
is 
slow. 
And 
yet 
where 
men 
of 



great 
wealth 
do 
stoop 
to 
husbandry, 
it 
multiplieth 
riches 
exceedingly. 
I 
knew 
a 
nobleman 
in 
England, 
that 
had 
the 
greatest 
audits 
of 
any 
man 
in 
my 
time; 
a 
great 
grazier, 
a 
great 
sheep-master, 
a 
great 
timber 
man, 
a 
great 
collier, 
a 
great 
corn-master, 
a 
great 
lead-man, 
and 
so 
of 
iron, 
and 
a 
number 
of 
the 
like 
points 
of 
husbandry. 
So 
as 
the 
earth 
seemed 
a 
sea 
to 
him, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
perpetual 
importation. 
It 
was 
truly 
observed 
by 
one, 
that 
himself 
came 
very 
hardly, 
to 
a 
little 
riches, 
and 
very 
easily, 
to 
great 
riches. 
For 
when 
a 
man’s 
stock 
is 
come 
to 
that, 
that 
he 
can 
expect 
the 
prime 
of 
markets, 
and 
overcome 
those 
bargains, 
which 
for 
their 
greatness 
are 
few 
men’s 
money, 
and 
be 
partner 
in 
the 
industries 
of 
younger 
men, 
he 
cannot 
but 
increase 
mainly. 
The 
gains 
of 
ordinary 
trades 
and 
vocations 
are 
honest; 
and 
furthered 
by 
two 
things 
chiefly: 
by 
diligence, 
and 
by 
a 
good 
name, 
for 
good 
and 
fair 
dealing. 
But 
the 
gains 
of 
bargains, 
are 
of 
a 
more 
doubtful 
nature; 
when 
men 
shall 
wait 
upon 
others’ 
necessity, 
broke 
by 
servants 
and 
instruments 
to 
draw 
them 
on, 
put 
off 
others 
cunningly, 
that 
would 
be 
better 
chapmen, 
and 
the 
like 
practices, 
which 
are 
crafty 
and 
naught. 
As 
for 
the 
chopping 
of 
bargains, 
when 
a 
man 
buys 
not 
to 
hold 
but 
to 
sell 
over 
again, 
that 
commonly 
grindeth 
double, 
both 
upon 
the 
seller, 
and 
upon 
the 
buyer. 
Sharings 
do 
greatly 
enrich, 
if 
the 
hands 
be 
well 
chosen, 
that 
are 
trusted. 
Usury 
is 
the 
certainest 
means 
of 
gain, 
though 
one 
of 
the 
worst; 
as 
that 
whereby 
a 
man 
doth 
eat 
his 
bread, 
in 
sudore 
vultus 
alieni; 
and 
besides, 
doth 
plough 
upon 
Sundays. 
But 
yet 
certain 
though 
it 
be, 
it 
hath 
flaws; 
for 
that 
the 
scriveners 
and 
brokers 
do 
value 
unsound 
men, 
to 
serve 
their 
own 
turn. 
The 
fortune 
in 
being 
the 
first, 
in 
an 
invention 
or 
in 
a 
privilege, 
doth 
cause 
sometimes 
a 
wonderful 
overgrowth 
in 
riches; 
as 
it 
was 
with 
the 
with 
the 
first 
sugar 
man, 
in 
the 
Canaries. 
Therefore 
if 
a 
man 
can 
play 
the 
true 
logician, 
to 
have 
as 
well 
judgment, 
as 
invention, 
he 
may 
do 
great 
matters; 
especially 
if 
the 
times 
be 
fit. 
He 
that 
resteth 
upon 
gains 
certain, 
shall 
hardly 
grow 
to 
great 
riches; 
and 
he 
that 
puts 
all 
upon 
adventures, 
doth 
oftentimes 
break 
and 
come 
to 
poverty: 
it 
is 
good, 
therefore, 
to 
guard 
adventures 
with 
certainties, 
that 
may 
uphold 
losses. 
Monopolies, 
and 
coemption 
of 
wares 
for 
re-sale, 
where 
they 
are 
not 
restrained, 
are 
great 
means 
to 
enrich; 
especially 
if 
the 
party 
have 
intelligence, 
what 
things 
are 
like 
to 
come 
into 
request, 
and 
so 
store 
himself 
beforehand. 
Riches 
gotten 
by 
service, 
though 
it 
be 
of 
the 
best 
rise, 
yet 
when 
they 
are 
gotten 
by 
flattery, 
feeding 
humors, 
and 
other 
servile 
conditions, 
they 
may 
be 
placed 
amongst 
the 
worst. 
As 
for 
fishing 
for 
testaments 
and 
executorships 
(as 
Tacitus 
saith 
of 
Seneca, 
testamenta 
et 
orbos 
tamquam 
indagine 
capi), 
it 
is 
yet 
worse; 
by 
how 
much 
men 
submit 



themselves 
to 
meaner 
persons, 
than 
in 
service. 
Believe 
not 
much, 
them 
that 
seem 
to 
despise 
riches 
for 
they 
despise 
them, 
that 
despair 
of 
them; 
and 
none 
worse, 
when 
they 
come 
to 
them. 
Be 
not 
penny-wise; 
riches 
have 
wings, 
and 
sometimes 
they 
fly 
away 
of 
themselves, 
sometimes 
they 
must 
be 
set 
flying, 
to 
bring 
in 
more. 
Men 
leave 
their 
riches, 
either 
to 
their 
kindred, 
or 
to 
the 
public; 
and 
moderate 
portions, 
prosper 
best 
in 
both. 
A 
great 
state 
left 
to 
an 
heir, 
is 
as 
a 
lure 
to 
all 
the 
birds 
of 
prey 
round 
about, 
to 
seize 
on 
him, 
if 
he 
be 
not 
the 
better 
stablished 
in 
years 
and 
judgment. 
Likewise 
glorious 
gifts 
and 
foundations, 
are 
like 
sacrifices 
without 
salt; 
and 
but 
the 
painted 
sepulchres 
of 
alms, 
which 
soon 
will 
putrefy, 
and 
corrupt 
inwardly. 
Therefore 
measure 
not 
thine 
advancements, 
by 
quantity, 
but 
frame 
them 
by 
measure: 
and 
defer 
not 
charities 
till 
death; 
for, 
certainly, 
if 
a 
man 
weigh 
it 
rightly, 
he 
that 
doth 
so, 
is 
rather 
liberal 
of 
another 
man’s, 
than 
of 
his 
own. 



OF 
PROPHECIES 


I 
mean 
not 
to 
speak 
of 
divine 
prophecies; 
nor 
of 
heathen 
oracles; 
nor 
of 
natural 
predictions; 
but 
only 
of 
prophecies 
that 
have 
been 
of 
certain 
memory, 
and 
from 
hidden 
causes. 
Saith 
the 
Pythonissa 
to 
Saul, 
To-morrow 
thou 
and 
thy 
son 
shall 
be 
with 
me. 
Homer 
hath 
these 
verses: 


At 
domus 
Aeneae 
cunctis 
dominabitur 
oris, 
Et 
nati 
natorum, 
et 
qui 
nascentur 
ab 
illis. 


A 
prophecy, 
as 
it 
seems, 
of 
the 
Roman 
empire. 
Seneca 
the 
tragedian 
hath 
these 
verses: 


— 
Venient 
annis 
Saecula 
seris, 
quibus 
Oceanus 
Vincula 
rerum 
laxet, 
et 
ingens 
Pateat 
Tellus, 
Tiphysque 
novos 
Detegat 
orbes; 
nec 
sit 
terris 
Ultima 
Thule: 
a 
prophecy 
of 
the 
discovery 
of 
America. 
daughter 
of 
Polycrates, 
dreamed 
that 
Jupiter 
bathed 
her 
father, 
and 
Apollo 
anointed 
him; 
and 
it 
came 
to 
the 
sun 
made 
his 
body 
run 
with 
sweat, 
and 
the 
rain 
washed 
it. 
Philip 
of 
Macedon 
dreamed, 
he 
sealed 
up 
his 
wife’s 
belly; 
whereby 
he 
did 
expound 
it, 
that 
his 
wife 
should 
be 
barren; 
but 
Aristander 
the 
soothsayer, 
told 
him 
his 
wife 
was 
with 
child 
because 
men 
do 
not 
use 
to 
seal 
vessels, 
that 
are 
empty. 
A 
phantasm 
that 
appeared 
to 
M. 
Brutus, 
in 
his 
tent, 
said 
to 
him, 
Philippis 
iterum 
me 
videbis. 
Tiberius 
said 
to 
Galba, 
Tu 
quoque, 
Galba, 
degustabis 
imperium. 
In 
Vespasian’s 
time, 
there 
went 
a 
prophecy 
in 
the 
East, 
that 
those 
that 
should 
come 
forth 
of 
Judea, 
should 
reign 
over 
the 
world: 
which 
though 
it 
may 
be 
was 
meant 
of 
our 
Savior; 
yet 
Tacitus 
expounds 
it 
of 
Vespasian. 
Domitian 
dreamed, 
the 
night 
before 
he 
was 
slain, 
that 
a 
golden 
head 
was 
growing, 
out 
of 
the 
nape 
of 
his 
neck: 
and 
indeed, 
the 
succession 
that 
followed 
him 
for 
many 
years, 
made 
golden 
times. 
Henry 
the 
Sixth 
of 
England, 
said 
of 
Henry 



the 
Seventh, 
when 
he 
was 
a 
lad, 
and 
gave 
him 
water, 
This 
is 
the 
lad 
that 
shall 
enjoy 
the 
crown, 
for 
which 
we 
strive. 
When 
I 
was 
in 
France, 
I 
heard 
from 
one 
Dr. 
Penal 
that 
the 
Queen 
Mother, 
who 
was 
given 
to 
curious 
arts, 
caused 
the 
King 
her 
husband’s 
nativity 
to 
be 
calculated, 
under 
a 
false 
name; 
and 
the 
astrologer 
gave 
a 
judgment, 
that 
he 
should 
be 
killed 
in 
a 
duel; 
at 
which 
the 
Queen 
laughed, 
thinking 
her 
husband 
to 
be 
above 
challenges 
and 
duels: 
but 
he 
was 
slain 
upon 
a 
course 
at 
tilt, 
the 
splinters 
of 
the 
staff 
of 
Montgomery 
going 
in 
at 
his 
beaver. 
The 
trivial 
prophecy, 
which 
I 
heard 
when 
I 
was 
a 
child, 
and 
Queen 
Elizabeth 
was 
in 
the 
flower 
of 
her 
years, 
was, 


When 
hempe 
is 
spun 
England’s 
done: 


whereby 
it 
was 
generally 
conceived, 
that 
after 
the 
princes 
had 
reigned, 
which 
had 
the 
principal 
letters 
of 
that 
word 
hempe 
(which 
were 
Henry, 
Edward, 
Mary, 
Philip, 
and 
Elizabeth), 
England 
should 
come 
to 
utter 
confusion; 
which, 
thanks 
be 
to 
God, 
is 
verified 
only 
in 
the 
change 
of 
the 
name; 
for 
that 
the 
King’s 
style, 
is 
now 
no 
more 
of 
England, 
but 
of 
Britian. 
There 
was 
also 
another 
prophecy, 
before 
the 
year 
of 
‘88, 
which 
I 
do 
not 
well 
understand. 


There 
shall 
be 
seen 
upon 
a 
day, 
Between 
the 
Baugh 
and 
the 
May, 
The 
black 
fleet 
of 
Norway. 
When 
that 
that 
come 
and 
gone, 
England 
build 
houses 
of 
lime 
and 
stone, 
For 
after 
wars 
shall 
you 
have 
none. 


It 
was 
generally 
conceived 
to 
be 
meant, 
of 
the 
Spanish 
fleet 
that 
came 
in 
‘88: 
for 
that 
the 
king 
of 
Spain’s 
surname, 
as 
they 
say, 
is 
Norway. 
The 
prediction 
of 
Regiomontanus, 


Octogesimus 
octavus 
mirabilis 
annus, 


was 
thought 
likewise 
accomplished 
in 
the 
sending 
of 
that 
great 
fleet, 
being 
the 
greatest 
in 
strength, 
though 
not 
in 
number, 
of 
all 
that 
ever 
swam 
upon 
the 
sea. 
As 
for 
Cleon’s 
dream, 
I 
think 
it 
was 
a 
jest. 
It 
was, 
that 
he 
was 



devoured 
of 
a 
long 
dragon; 
and 
it 
was 
expounded 
of 
a 
maker 
of 
sausages, 
that 
troubled 
him 
exceedingly. 
There 
are 
numbers 
of 
the 
like 
kind; 
especially 
if 
you 
include 
dreams, 
and 
predictions 
of 
astrology. 
But 
I 
have 
set 
down 
these 
few 
only, 
of 
certain 
credit, 
for 
example. 
My 
judgment 
is, 
that 
they 
ought 
all 
to 
be 
despised; 
and 
ought 
to 
serve 
but 
for 
winter 
talk 
by 
the 
fireside. 
Though 
when 
I 
say 
despised, 
I 
mean 
it 
as 
for 
belief; 
for 
otherwise, 
the 
spreading, 
or 
publishing, 
of 
them, 
is 
in 
no 
sort 
to 
be 
despised. 
For 
they 
have 
done 
much 
mischief; 
and 
I 
see 
many 
severe 
laws 
made, 
to 
suppress 
them. 
That 
that 
hath 
given 
them 
grace, 
and 
some 
credit, 
consisteth 
in 
three 
things. 
First, 
that 
men 
mark 
when 
they 
hit, 
and 
never 
mark 
when 
they 
miss; 
as 
they 
do 
generally 
also 
of 
dreams. 
The 
second 
is, 
that 
probable 
conjectures, 
or 
obscure 
traditions, 
many 
times 
turn 
themselves 
into 
prophecies; 
while 
the 
nature 
of 
man, 
which 
coveteth 
divination, 
thinks 
it 
no 
peril 
to 
foretell 
that 
which 
indeed 
they 
do 
but 
collect. 
As 
that 
of 
Seneca’s 
verse. 
For 
so 
much 
was 
then 
subject 
to 
demonstration, 
that 
the 
globe 
of 
the 
earth 
had 
great 
parts 
beyond 
the 
Atlantic, 
which 
mought 
be 
probably 
conceived 
not 
to 
be 
all 
sea: 
and 
adding 
thereto 
the 
tradition 
in 
Plato’s 
Timaeus, 
and 
his 
Atlanticus, 
it 
mought 
encourage 
one 
to 
turn 
it 
to 
a 
prediction. 
The 
third 
and 
last 
(which 
is 
the 
great 
one) 
is, 
that 
almost 
all 
of 
them, 
being 
infinite 
in 
number, 
have 
been 
impostures, 
and 
by 
idle 
and 
crafty 
brains 
merely 
contrived 
and 
feigned, 
after 
the 
event 
past. 



OF 
AMBITION 


Ambition 
is 
like 
choler; 
which 
is 
an 
humor 
that 
maketh 
men 
active, 
earnest, 
full 
of 
alacrity, 
and 
stirring, 
if 
it 
be 
not 
stopped. 
But 
if 
it 
be 
stopped, 
and 
cannot 
have 
his 
way, 
it 
becometh 
adust, 
and 
thereby 
malign 
and 
venomous. 
So 
ambitious 
men, 
if 
they 
find 
the 
way 
open 
for 
their 
rising, 
and 
still 
get 
forward, 
they 
are 
rather 
busy 
than 
dangerous; 
but 
if 
they 
be 
checked 
in 
their 
desires, 
they 
become 
secretly 
discontent, 
and 
look 
upon 
men 
and 
matters 
with 
an 
evil 
eye, 
and 
are 
best 
pleased, 
when 
things 
go 
backward; 
which 
is 
the 
worst 
property 
in 
a 
servant 
of 
a 
prince, 
or 
state. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
good 
for 
princes, 
if 
they 
use 
ambitious 
men, 
to 
handle 
it, 
so 
as 
they 
be 
still 
progressive 
and 
not 
retrograde; 
which, 
because 
it 
cannot 
be 
without 
inconvenience, 
it 
is 
good 
not 
to 
use 
such 
natures 
at 
all. 
For 
if 
they 
rise 
not 
with 
their 
service, 
they 
will 
take 
order, 
to 
make 
their 
service 
fall 
with 
them. 
But 
since 
we 
have 
said, 
it 
were 
good 
not 
to 
use 
men 
of 
ambitious 
natures, 
except 
it 
be 
upon 
necessity, 
it 
is 
fit 
we 
speak, 
in 
what 
cases 
they 
are 
of 
necessity. 
Good 
commanders 
in 
the 
wars 
must 
be 
taken, 
be 
they 
never 
so 
ambitious; 
for 
the 
use 
of 
their 
service, 
dispenseth 
with 
the 
rest; 
and 
to 
take 
a 
soldier 
without 
ambition, 
is 
to 
pull 
off 
his 
spurs. 
There 
is 
also 
great 
use 
of 
ambitious 
men, 
in 
being 
screens 
to 
princes 
in 
matters 
of 
danger 
and 
envy; 
for 
no 
man 
will 
take 
that 
part, 
except 
he 
be 
like 
a 
seeled 
dove, 
that 
mounts 
and 
mounts, 
because 
he 
cannot 
see 
about 
him. 
There 
is 
use 
also 
of 
ambitious 
men, 
in 
pulling 
down 
the 
greatness 
of 
any 
subject 
that 
over-tops; 
as 
Tiberius 
used 
Marco, 
in 
the 
pulling 
down 
of 
Sejanus. 
Since, 
therefore, 
they 
must 
be 
used 
in 
such 
cases, 
there 
resteth 
to 
speak, 
how 
they 
are 
to 
be 
bridled, 
that 
they 
may 
be 
less 
dangerous. 
There 
is 
less 
danger 
of 
them, 
if 
they 
be 
of 
mean 
birth, 
than 
if 
they 
be 
noble; 
and 
if 
they 
be 
rather 
harsh 
of 
nature, 
than 
gracious 
and 
popular: 
and 
if 
they 
be 
rather 
new 
raised, 
than 
grown 
cunning, 
and 
fortified, 
in 
their 
greatness. 
It 
is 
counted 
by 
some, 
a 
weakness 
in 
princes, 
to 
have 
favorites; 
but 
it 
is, 
of 
all 
others, 
the 
best 
remedy 
against 
ambitious 
great-ones. 
For 
when 
the 
way 
of 
pleasuring, 
and 
displeasuring, 
lieth 
by 
the 
favorite, 
it 
is 
impossible 
any 
other 
should 
be 
overgreat. 
Another 
means 
to 
curb 
them, 
is 
to 
balance 
them 
by 
others, 
as 
proud 
as 
they. 
But 
then 
there 
must 
be 
some 
middle 
counsellors, 
to 
keep 
things 
steady; 
for 
without 
that 
ballast, 



the 
ship 
will 
roll 
too 
much. 
At 
the 
least, 
a 
prince 
may 
animate 
and 
inure 
some 
meaner 
persons, 
to 
be 
as 
it 
were 
scourges, 
to 
ambitions 
men. 
As 
for 
the 
having 
of 
them 
obnoxious 
to 
ruin; 
if 
they 
be 
of 
fearful 
natures, 
it 
may 
do 
well; 
but 
if 
they 
be 
stout 
and 
daring, 
it 
may 
precipitate 
their 
designs, 
and 
prove 
dangerous. 
As 
for 
the 
pulling 
of 
them 
down, 
if 
the 
affairs 
require 
it, 
and 
that 
it 
may 
not 
be 
done 
with 
safety 
suddenly, 
the 
only 
way 
is 
the 
interchange, 
continually, 
of 
favors 
and 
disgraces; 
whereby 
they 
may 
not 
know 
what 
to 
expect, 
and 
be, 
as 
it 
were, 
in 
a 
wood. 
Of 
ambitions, 
it 
is 
less 
harmful, 
the 
ambition 
to 
prevail 
in 
great 
things, 
than 
that 
other, 
to 
appear 
in 
every 
thing; 
for 
that 
breeds 
confusion, 
and 
mars 
business. 
But 
yet 
it 
is 
less 
danger, 
to 
have 
an 
ambitious 
man 
stirring 
in 
business, 
than 
great 
in 
dependences. 
He 
that 
seeketh 
to 
be 
eminent 
amongst 
able 
men, 
hath 
a 
great 
task; 
but 
that 
is 
ever 
good 
for 
the 
public. 
But 
he, 
that 
plots 
to 
be 
the 
only 
figure 
amongst 
ciphers, 
is 
the 
decay 
of 
a 
whole 
age. 
Honor 
hath 
three 
things 
in 
it: 
the 
vantage 
ground 
to 
do 
good; 
the 
approach 
to 
kings 
and 
principal 
persons; 
and 
the 
raising 
of 
a 
man’s 
own 
fortunes. 
He 
that 
hath 
the 
best 
of 
these 
intentions, 
when 
he 
aspireth, 
is 
an 
honest 
man; 
and 
that 
prince, 
that 
can 
discern 
of 
these 
intentions 
in 
another 
that 
aspireth, 
is 
a 
wise 
prince. 
Generally, 
let 
princes 
and 
states 
choose 
such 
ministers, 
as 
are 
more 
sensible 
of 
duty 
than 
of 
rising; 
and 
such 
as 
love 
business 
rather 
upon 
conscience, 
than 
upon 
bravery, 
and 
let 
them 
discern 
a 
busy 
nature, 
from 
a 
willing 
mind. 



OF 
MASQUES 
AND 
TRIUMPHS 


These 
things 
are 
but 
toys, 
to 
come 
amongst 
such 
serious 
observations. 
But 
yet, 
since 
princes 
will 
have 
such 
things, 
it 
is 
better 
they 
should 
be 
graced 
with 
elegancy, 
than 
daubed 
with 
cost. 
Dancing 
to 
song, 
is 
a 
thing 
of 
great 
state 
and 
pleasure. 
I 
understand 
it, 
that 
the 
song 
be 
in 
quire, 
placed 
aloft, 
and 
accompanied 
with 
some 
broken 
music; 
and 
the 
ditty 
fitted 
to 
the 
device. 
Acting 
in 
song, 
especially 
in 
dialogues, 
hath 
an 
extreme 
good 
grace; 
I 
say 
acting, 
not 
dancing 
(for 
that 
is 
a 
mean 
and 
vulgar 
thing); 
and 
the 
voices 
of 
the 
dialogue 
would 
be 
strong 
and 
manly 
(a 
base 
and 
a 
tenor; 
no 
treble); 
and 
the 
ditty 
high 
and 
tragical; 
not 
nice 
or 
dainty. 
Several 
quires, 
placed 
one 
over 
against 
another, 
and 
taking 
the 
voice 
by 
catches, 
anthem-
wise, 
give 
great 
pleasure. 
Turning 
dances 
into 
figure, 
is 
a 
childish 
curiosity. 
And 
generally 
let 
it 
be 
noted, 
that 
those 
things 
which 
I 
here 
set 
down, 
are 
such 
as 
do 
naturally 
take 
the 
sense, 
and 
not 
respect 
petty 
wonderments. 
It 
is 
true, 
the 
alterations 
of 
scenes, 
so 
it 
be 
quietly 
and 
without 
noise, 
are 
things 
of 
great 
beauty 
and 
pleasure; 
for 
they 
feed 
and 
relieve 
the 
eye, 
before 
it 
be 
full 
of 
the 
same 
object. 
Let 
the 
scenes 
abound 
with 
light, 
specially 
colored 
and 
varied; 
and 
let 
the 
masquers, 
or 
any 
other, 
that 
are 
to 
come 
down 
from 
the 
scene, 
have 
some 
motions 
upon 
the 
scene 
itself, 
before 
their 
coming 
down; 
for 
it 
draws 
the 
eye 
strangely, 
and 
makes 
it, 
with 
great 
pleasure, 
to 
desire 
to 
see, 
that 
it 
cannot 
perfectly 
discern. 
Let 
the 
gongs 
be 
loud 
and 
cheerful, 
and 
not 
chirpings 
or 
pulings. 
Let 
the 
music 
likewise 
be 
sharp 
and 
loud, 
and 
well 
placed. 
The 
colors 
that 
show 
best 
by 
candle-light 
are 
white, 
carnation, 
and 
a 
kind 
of 
sea-water-green; 
and 
oes, 
or 
spangs, 
as 
they 
are 
of 
no 
great 
cost, 
so 
they 
are 
of 
most 
glory. 
As 
for 
rich 
embroidery, 
it 
is 
lost 
and 
not 
discerned. 
Let 
the 
suits 
of 
the 
masquers 
be 
graceful, 
and 
such 
as 
become 
the 
person, 
when 
the 
vizors 
are 
off; 
not 
after 
examples 
of 
known 
attires; 
Turke, 
soldiers, 
mariners, 
and 
the 
like. 
Let 
anti-masques 
not 
be 
long; 
they 
have 
been 
commonly 
of 
fools, 
satyrs, 
baboons, 
wild-men, 
antics, 
beasts, 
sprites, 
witches, 
Ethiops, 
pigmies, 
turquets, 
nymphs, 
rustics, 
Cupids, 
statuas 
moving, 
and 
the 
like. 
As 
for 
angels, 
it 
is 
not 
comical 
enough, 
to 
put 
them 
in 
anti-
masques; 
and 
anything 
that 
is 
hideous, 
as 
devils, 
giants, 
is 
on 
the 
other 
side 
as 
unfit. 
But 
chiefly, 
let 
the 
music 
of 
them 
be 
recreative, 
and 
with 
some 
strange 



changes. 
Some 
sweet 
odors 
suddenly 
coming 
forth, 
without 
any 
drops 
falling, 
are, 
in 
such 
a 
company 
as 
there 
is 
steam 
and 
heat, 
things 
of 
great 
pleasure 
and 
refreshment. 
Double 
masques, 
one 
of 
men, 
another 
of 
ladies, 
addeth 
state 
and 
variety. 
But 
all 
is 
nothing 
except 
the 
room 
be 
kept 
clear 
and 
neat. 


For 
justs, 
and 
tourneys, 
and 
barriers; 
the 
glories 
of 
them 
are 
chiefly 
in 
the 
chariots, 
wherein 
the 
challengers 
make 
their 
entry; 
especially 
if 
they 
be 
drawn 
with 
strange 
beasts: 
as 
lions, 
bears, 
camels, 
and 
the 
like; 
or 
in 
the 
devices 
of 
their 
entrance; 
or 
in 
the 
bravery 
of 
their 
liveries; 
or 
in 
the 
goodly 
furniture 
of 
their 
horses 
and 
armor. 
But 
enough 
of 
these 
toys. 



OF 
NATURE 
IN 
MEN 


Nature 
is 
often 
hidden; 
sometimes 
overcome; 
seldom 
extinguished. 
Force, 
maketh 
nature 
more 
violent 
in 
the 
return; 
doctrine 
and 
discourse, 
maketh 
nature 
less 
importune; 
but 
custom 
only 
doth 
alter 
and 
subdue 
nature. 
He 
that 
seeketh 
victory 
over 
his 
nature, 
let 
him 
not 
set 
himself 
too 
great, 
nor 
too 
small 
tasks; 
for 
the 
first 
will 
make 
him 
dejected 
by 
often 
failings; 
and 
the 
second 
will 
make 
him 
a 
small 
proceeder, 
though 
by 
often 
prevailings. 
And 
at 
the 
first 
let 
him 
practise 
with 
helps, 
as 
swimmers 
do 
with 
bladders 
or 
rushes; 
but 
after 
a 
time 
let 
him 
practise 
with 
disadvantages, 
as 
dancers 
do 
with 
thick 
shoes. 
For 
it 
breeds 
great 
perfection, 
if 
the 
practice 
be 
harder 
than 
the 
use. 
Where 
nature 
is 
mighty, 
and 
therefore 
the 
victory 
hard, 
the 
degrees 
had 
need 
be, 
first 
to 
stay 
and 
arrest 
nature 
in 
time; 
like 
to 
him 
that 
would 
say 
over 
the 
four 
and 
twenty 
letters 
when 
he 
was 
angry; 
then 
to 
go 
less 
in 
quantity; 
as 
if 
one 
should, 
in 
forbearing 
wine, 
come 
from 
drinking 
healths, 
to 
a 
draught 
at 
a 
meal; 
and 
lastly, 
to 
discontinue 
altogether. 
But 
if 
a 
man 
have 
the 
fortitude, 
and 
resolution, 
to 
enfranchise 
himself 
at 
once, 
that 
is 
the 
best: 


Optimus 
ille 
animi 
vindex 
laedentia 
pectus 
Vincula 
qui 
rupit, 
dedoluitque 
semel. 


Neither 
is 
the 
ancient 
rule 
amiss, 
to 
bend 
nature, 
as 
a 
wand, 
to 
a 
contrary 
extreme, 
whereby 
to 
set 
it 
right, 
understanding 
it, 
where 
the 
contrary 
extreme 
is 
no 
vice. 
Let 
not 
a 
man 
force 
a 
habit 
upon’ 
himself, 
with 
a 
perpetual 
continuance, 
but 
with 
some 
intermission. 
For 
both 
the 
pause 
reinforceth 
the 
new 
onset; 
and 
if 
a 
man 
that 
is 
not 
perfect, 
be 
ever 
in 
practice, 
he 
shall 
as 
well 
practise 
his 
errors, 
as 
his 
abilities, 
and 
induce 
one 
habit 
of 
both; 
and 
there 
is 
no 
means 
to 
help 
this, 
but 
by 
seasonable 
intermissions. 
But 
let 
not 
a 
man 
trust 
his 
victory 
over 
his 
nature, 
too 
far; 
for 
nature 
will 
lay 
buried 
a 
great 
time, 
and 
yet 
revive, 
upon 
the 
occasion 
or 
temptation. 
Like 
as 
it 
was 
with 
AEsop’s 
damsel, 
turned 
from 
a 
cat 
to 
a 
woman, 
who 
sat 
very 
demurely 
at 
the 
board’s 
end, 
till 
a 
mouse 
ran 
before 
her. 
Therefore, 
let 
a 
man 
either 
avoid 
the 
occasion 
altogether; 
or 
put 
himself 
often 
to 
it, 
that 
he 
may 
be 
little 
moved 
with 
it. 
A 
man’s 
nature 
is 
best 
perceived 
in 
privateness, 
for 
there 



is 
no 
affectation; 
in 
passion, 
for 
that 
putteth 
a 
man 
out 
of 
his 
precepts; 
and 
in 
a 
new 
case 
or 
experiment, 
for 
there 
custom 
leaveth 
him. 
They 
are 
happy 
men, 
whose 
natures 
sort 
with 
their 
vocations; 
otherwise 
they 
may 
say, 
multum 
incola 
fuit 
anima 
mea; 
when 
they 
converse 
in 
those 
things, 
they 
do 
not 
affect. 
In 
studies, 
whatsoever 
a 
man 
commandeth 
upon 
himself, 
let 
him 
set 
hours 
for 
it; 
but 
whatsoever 
is 
agreeable 
to 
his 
nature, 
let 
him 
take 
no 
care 
for 
any 
set 
times; 
for 
his 
thoughts 
will 
fly 
to 
it, 
of 
themselves; 
so 
as 
the 
spaces 
of 
other 
business, 
or 
studies, 
will 
suffice. 
A 
man’s 
nature, 
runs 
either 
to 
herbs 
or 
weeds; 
therefore 
let 
him 
seasonably 
water 
the 
one, 
and 
destroy 
the 
other. 



OF 
CUSTOM 
AND 
EDUCATION 


Men’s 
thoughts, 
are 
much 
according 
to 
their 
inclination; 
their 
discourse 
and 
speeches, 
according 
to 
their 
learning 
and 
infused 
opinions; 
but 
their 
deeds, 
are 
after 
as 
they 
have 
been 
accustomed. 
And 
therefore, 
as 
Machiavel 
well 
noteth 
(though 
in 
an 
evil-favored 
instance), 
there 
is 
no 
trusting 
to 
the 
force 
of 
nature, 
nor 
to 
the 
bravery 
of 
words, 
except 
it 
be 
corroborate 
by 
custom. 
His 
instance 
is, 
that 
for 
the 
achieving 
of 
a 
desperate 
conspiracy, 
a 
man 
should 
not 
rest 
upon 
the 
fierceness 
of 
any 
man’s 
nature, 
or 
his 
resolute 
undertakings; 
but 
take 
such 
an 
one, 
as 
hath 
had 
his 
hands 
formerly 
in 
blood. 
But 
Machiavel 
knew 
not 
of 
a 
Friar 
Clement, 
nor 
a 
Ravillac, 
nor 
a 
Jaureguy, 
nor 
a 
Baltazar 
Gerard; 
yet 
his 
rule 
holdeth 
still, 
that 
nature, 
nor 
the 
engagement 
of 
words, 
are 
not 
so 
forcible, 
as 
custom. 
Only 
superstition 
is 
now 
so 
well 
advanced, 
that 
men 
of 
the 
first 
blood, 
are 
as 
firm 
as 
butchers 
by 
occupation; 
and 
votary 
resolution, 
is 
made 
equipollent 
to 
custom, 
even 
in 
matter 
of 
blood. 
In 
other 
things, 
the 
predominancy 
of 
custom 
is 
everywhere 
visible; 
insomuch 
as 
a 
man 
would 
wonder, 
to 
hear 
men 
profess, 
protest, 
engage, 
give 
great 
words, 
and 
then 
do, 
just 
as 
they 
have 
done 
before; 
as 
if 
they 
were 
dead 
images, 
and 
engines 
moved 
only 
by 
the 
wheels 
of 
custom. 
We 
see 
also 
the 
reign 
or 
tyranny 
of 
custom, 
what 
it 
is. 
The 
Indians 
(I 
mean 
the 
sect 
of 
their 
wise 
men) 
lay 
themselves 
quietly 
upon 
a 
stock 
of 
wood, 
and 
so 
sacrifice 
themselves 
by 
fire. 
Nay, 
the 
wives 
strive 
to 
be 
burned, 
with 
the 
corpses 
of 
their 
husbands. 
The 
lads 
of 
Sparta, 
of 
ancient 
time, 
were 
wont 
to 
be 
scourged 
upon 
the 
altar 
of 
Diana, 
without 
so 
much 
as 
queching. 
I 
remember, 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
Queen 
Elizabeth’s 
time 
of 
England, 
an 
Irish 
rebel 
condemned, 
put 
up 
a 
petition 
to 
the 
deputy, 
that 
he 
might 
be 
hanged 
in 
a 
withe, 
and 
not 
in 
an 
halter; 
because 
it 
had 
been 
so 
used, 
with 
former 
rebels. 
There 
be 
monks 
in 
Russia, 
for 
penance, 
that 
will 
sit 
a 
whole 
night 
in 
a 
vessel 
of 
water, 
till 
they 
be 
engaged 
with 
hard 
ice. 
Many 
examples 
may 
be 
put 
of 
the 
force 
of 
custom, 
both 
upon 
mind 
and 
body. 
Therefore, 
since 
custom 
is 
the 
principal 
magistrate 
of 
man’s 
life, 
let 
men 
by 
all 
means 
endeavor, 
to 
obtain 
good 
customs. 
Certainly 
custom 
is 
most 
perfect, 
when 
it 
beginneth 
in 
young 
years: 
this 
we 
call 
education; 
which 
is, 
in 
effect, 
but 
an 
early 
custom. 
So 
we 
see, 
in 
languages, 
the 
tongue 
is 
more 
pliant 
to 
all 
expressions 
and 
sounds, 
the 



joints 
are 
more 
supple, 
to 
all 
feats 
of 
activity 
and 
motions, 
in 
youth 
than 
afterwards. 
For 
it 
is 
true, 
that 
late 
learners 
cannot 
so 
well 
take 
the 
ply; 
except 
it 
be 
in 
some 
minds 
that 
have 
not 
suffered 
themselves 
to 
fix, 
but 
have 
kept 
themselves 
open, 
and 
prepared 
to 
receive 
continual 
amendment, 
which 
is 
exceeding 
rare. 
But 
if 
the 
force 
of 
custom 
simple 
and 
separate, 
be 
great, 
the 
force 
of 
custom 
copulate 
and 
conjoined 
and 
collegiate, 
is 
far 
greater. 
For 
there 
example 
teacheth, 
company 
comforteth, 
emulation 
quickeneth, 
glory 
raiseth: 
so 
as 
in 
such 
places 
the 
force 
of 
custom 
is 
in 
his 
exaltation. 
Certainly 
the 
great 
multiplication 
of 
virtues 
upon 
human 
nature, 
resteth 
uponsocieties 
well 
ordained 
and 
disciplined. 
For 
commonwealths, 
and 
good 
governments, 
do 
nourish 
virtue 
grown, 
but 
do 
not 
much 
mend 
the 
deeds. 
But 
the 
misery 
is, 
that 
the 
most 
effectual 
means, 
are 
now 
applied 
to 
the 
ends, 
least 
to 
be 
desired. 



OF 
FORTUNE 


It 
cannot 
be 
denied, 
but 
outward 
accidents 
conduce 
much 
to 
fortune; 
favor, 
opportunity, 
death 
of 
others, 
occasion 
fitting 
virtue. 
But 
chiefly, 
the 
mould 
of 
a 
man’s 
fortune 
is 
in 
his 
own 
hands. 
Faber 
quisque 
fortunae 
suae, 
saith 
the 
poet. 
And 
the 
most 
frequent 
of 
external 
causes 
is, 
that 
the 
folly 
of 
one 
man, 
is 
the 
fortune 
of 
another. 
For 
no 
man 
prospers 
so 
suddenly, 
as 
by 
others’ 
errors. 
Serpens 
nisi 
serpentem 
comederit 
non 
fit 
draco. 
Overt 
and 
apparent 
virtues, 
bring 
forth 
praise; 
but 
there 
be 
secret 
and 
hidden 
virtues, 
that 
bring 
forth 
fortune; 
certain 
deliveries 
of 
a 
man’s 
self, 
which 
have 
no 
name. 
The 
Spanish 
name, 
desemboltura, 
partly 
expresseth 
them; 
when 
there 
be 
not 
stonds 
nor 
restiveness 
in 
a 
man’s 
nature; 
but 
that 
the 
wheels 
of 
his 
mind, 
keep 
way 
with 
the 
wheels 
of 
his 
fortune. 
For 
so 
Livy 
(after 
he 
had 
described 
Cato 
Major 
in 
these 
words, 
In 
illo 
viro 
tantum 
robur 
corporis 
et 
animi 
fuit, 
ut 
quocunque 
loco 
natus 
esset, 
fortunam 
sibi 
facturus 
videretur) 
falleth 
upon 
that, 
that 
he 
had 
versatile 
ingenium. 
Therefore 
if 
a 
man 
look 
sharply 
and 
attentively, 
he 
shall 
see 
Fortune: 
for 
though 
she 
be 
blind, 
yet 
she 
is 
not 
invisible. 
The 
way 
of 
fortune, 
is 
like 
the 
Milken 
Way 
in 
the 
sky; 
which 
is 
a 
meeting 
or 
knot 
of 
a 
number 
of 
small 
stars; 
not 
seen 
asunder, 
but 
giving 
light 
together. 
So 
are 
there 
a 
number 
of 
little, 
and 
scarce 
discerned 
virtues, 
or 
rather 
faculties 
and 
customs, 
that 
make 
men 
fortunate. 
The 
Italians 
note 
some 
of 
them, 
such 
as 
a 
man 
would 
little 
think. 
When 
they 
speak 
of 
one 
that 
cannot 
do 
amiss, 
they 
will 
throw 
in, 
into 
his 
other 
conditions, 
that 
he 
hath 
Poco 
di 
matto. 
And 
certainly 
there 
be 
not 
two 
more 
fortunate 
properties, 
than 
to 
have 
a 
little 
of 
the 
fool, 
and 
not 
too 
much 
of 
the 
honest. 
Therefore 
extreme 
lovers 
of 
their 
country 
or 
masters, 
were 
never 
fortunate, 
neither 
can 
they 
be. 
For 
when 
a 
man 
placeth 
his 
thoughts 
without 
himself, 
he 
goeth 
not 
his 
own 
way. 
An 
hasty 
fortune 
maketh 
an 
enterpriser 
and 
remover 
(the 
French 
hath 
it 
better, 
entreprenant, 
or 
remuant); 
but 
the 
exercised 
fortune 
maketh 
the 
able 
man. 
Fortune 
is 
to 
be 
honored 
and 
respected, 
and 
it 
be 
but 
for 
her 
daughters, 
Confidence 
and 
Reputation. 
For 
those 
two, 
Felicity 
breedeth; 
the 
first 
within 
a 
man’s 
self, 
the 
latter 
in 
others 
towards 
him. 
All 
wise 
men, 
to 
decline 
the 
envy 
of 
their 
own 
virtues, 
use 
to 
ascribe 
them 
to 
Providence 
and 
Fortune; 
for 
so 
they 
may 
the 
better 
assume 
them: 
and, 
besides, 
it 
is 
greatness 
in 
a 
man, 
to 



be 
the 
care 
of 
the 
higher 
powers. 
So 
Caesar 
said 
to 
the 
pilot 
in 
the 
tempest, 
Caesarem 
portas, 
et 
fortunam 
ejus. 
So 
Sylla 
chose 
the 
name 
of 
Felix, 
and 
not 
of 
Magnus. 
And 
it 
hath 
been 
noted, 
that 
those 
who 
ascribe 
openly 
too 
much 
to 
their 
own 
wisdom 
and 
policy, 
end 
infortunate. 
It 
is 
written 
that 
Timotheus 
the 
Athenian, 
after 
he 
had, 
in 
the 
account 
he 
gave 
to 
the 
state 
of 
his 
government, 
often 
interlaced 
this 
speech, 
and 
in 
this, 
Fortune 
had 
no 
part, 
never 
prospered 
in 
anything, 
he 
undertook 
afterwards. 
Certainly 
there 
be, 
whose 
fortunes 
are 
like 
Homer’s 
verses, 
that 
have 
a 
slide 
and 
easiness 
more 
than 
the 
verses 
of 
other 
poets; 
as 
Plutarch 
saith 
of 
Timoleon’s 
fortune, 
in 
respect 
of 
that 
of 
Agesilaus 
or 
Epaminondas. 
And 
that 
this 
should 
be, 
no 
doubt 
it 
is 
much, 
in 
a 
man’s 
self. 



OF 
USURY 


Many 
have 
made 
witty 
invectives 
against 
usury. 
They 
say 
that 
it 
is 
a 
pity, 
the 
devil 
should 
have 
God’s 
part, 
which 
is 
the 
tithe. 
That 
the 
usurer 
is 
the 
greatest 
Sabbath-breaker, 
because 
his 
plough 
goeth 
every 
Sunday. 
That 
the 
usurer 
is 
the 
drone, 
that 
Virgil 
speaketh 
of; 


Ignavum 
fucos 
pecus 
a 
praesepibus 
arcent. 


That 
the 
usurer 
breaketh 
the 
first 
law, 
that 
was 
made 
for 
mankind 
after 
the 
fall, 
which 
was, 
in 
sudore 
vultus 
tui 
comedes 
panem 
tuum; 
not, 
in 
sudore 
vultus 
alieni. 
That 
usurers 
should 
have 
orange-tawny 
bonnets, 
because 
they 
do 
judaize. 
That 
it 
is 
against 
nature 
for 
money 
to 
beget 
money; 
and 
the 
like. 
I 
say 
this 
only, 
that 
usury 
is 
a 
concessum 
propter 
duritiem 
cordis; 
for 
since 
there 
must 
be 
borrowing 
and 
lending, 
and 
men 
are 
so 
hard 
of 
heart, 
as 
they 
will 
not 
lend 
freely, 
usury 
must 
be 
permitted. 
Some 
others, 
have 
made 
suspicious 
and 
cunning 
propositions 
of 
banks, 
discovery 
of 
men’s 
estates, 
and 
other 
inventions. 
But 
few 
have 
spoken 
of 
usury 
usefully. 
It 
is 
good 
to 
set 
before 
us, 
the 
incommodities 
and 
commodities 
of 
usury, 
that 
the 
good, 
may 
be 
either 
weighed 
out 
or 
called 
out; 
and 
warily 
to 
provide, 
that 
while 
we 
make 
forth 
to 
that 
which 
is 
better, 
we 
meet 
not 
with 
that 
which 
is 
worse. 


The 
discommodities 
of 
usury 
are, 
First, 
that 
it 
makes 
fewer 
merchants. 
For 
were 
it 
not 
for 
this 
lazy 
trade 
of 
usury, 
money 
would 
not 
he 
still, 
but 
would 
in 
great 
part 
be 
employed 
upon 
merchandizing; 
which 
is 
the 
vena 
porta 
of 
wealth 
in 
a 
state. 
The 
second, 
that 
it 
makes 
poor 
merchants. 
For, 
as 
a 
farmer 
cannot 
husband 
his 
ground 
so 
well, 
if 
he 
sit 
at 
a 
great 
rent; 
so 
the 
merchant 
cannot 
drive 
his 
trade 
so 
well, 
if 
he 
sit 
at 
great 
usury. 
The 
third 
is 
incident 
to 
the 
other 
two; 
and 
that 
is 
the 
decay 
of 
customs 
of 
kings 
or 
states, 
which 
ebb 
or 
flow, 
with 
merchandizing. 
The 
fourth, 
that 
it 
bringeth 
the 
treasure 
of 
a 
realm, 
or 
state, 
into 
a 
few 
hands. 
For 
the 
usurer 
being 
at 
certainties, 
and 
others 
at 
uncertainties, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
game, 
most 
of 
the 
money 
will 
be 
in 
the 
box; 
and 
ever 
a 
state 
flourisheth, 
when 
wealth 
is 
more 
equally 
spread. 
The 
fifth, 
that 
it 
beats 
down 
the 
price 
of 
land; 
for 
the 
employment 
of 
money, 
is 
chiefly 
either 
merchandizing 
or 
purchasing; 
and 
usury 
waylays 
both. 
The 
sixth, 
that 
it 
doth 
dull 
and 
damp 
all 
industries, 



improvements, 
and 
new 
inventions, 
wherein 
money 
would 
be 
stirring, 
if 
it 
were 
not 
for 
this 
slug. 
The 
last, 
that 
it 
is 
the 
canker 
and 
ruin 
of 
many 
men’s 
estates; 
which, 
in 
process 
of 
time, 
breeds 
a 
public 
poverty. 


On 
the 
other 
side, 
the 
commodities 
of 
usury 
are, 
first, 
that 
howsoever 
usury 
in 
some 
respect 
hindereth 
merchandizing, 
yet 
in 
some 
other 
it 
advanceth 
it; 
for 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
the 
greatest 
part 
of 
trade 
is 
driven 
by 
young 
merchants, 
upon 
borrowing 
at 
interest; 
so 
as 
if 
the 
usurer 
either 
call 
in, 
or 
keep 
back, 
his 
money, 
there 
will 
ensue, 
presently, 
a 
great 
stand 
of 
trade. 
The 
second 
is, 
that 
were 
it 
not 
for 
this 
easy 
borrowing 
upon 
interest, 
men’s 
necessities 
would 
draw 
upon 
them 
a 
most 
sudden 
undoing; 
in 
that 
they 
would 
be 
forced 
to 
sell 
their 
means 
(be 
it 
lands 
or 
goods) 
far 
under 
foot; 
and 
so, 
whereas 
usury 
doth 
but 
gnaw 
upon 
them, 
bad 
markets 
would 
swallow 
them 
quite 
up. 
As 
for 
mortgaging 
or 
pawning, 
it 
will 
little 
mend 
the 
matter: 
for 
either 
men 
will 
not 
take 
pawns 
without 
use; 
or 
if 
they 
do, 
they 
will 
look 
precisely 
for 
the 
forfeiture. 
I 
remember 
a 
cruel 
moneyed 
man 
in 
the 
country, 
that 
would 
say, 
The 
devil 
take 
this 
usury, 
it 
keeps 
us 
from 
forfeitures, 
of 
mortgages 
and 
bonds. 
The 
third 
and 
last 
is, 
that 
it 
is 
a 
vanity 
to 
conceive, 
that 
there 
would 
be 
ordinary 
borrowing 
without 
profit; 
and 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
conceive, 
the 
number 
of 
inconveniences 
that 
will 
ensue, 
if 
borrowing 
be 
cramped. 
Therefore 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
abolishing 
of 
usury 
is 
idle. 
All 
states 
have 
ever 
had 
it, 
in 
one 
kind 
or 
rate, 
or 
other. 
So 
as 
that 
opinion 
must 
be 
sent 
to 
Utopia. 


To 
speak 
now 
of 
the 
reformation, 
and 
reiglement, 
of 
usury; 
how 
the 
discommodities 
of 
it 
may 
be 
best 
avoided, 
and 
the 
commodities 
retained. 
It 
appears, 
by 
the 
balance 
of 
commodities 
and 
discommodities 
of 
usury, 
two 
things 
are 
to 
be 
reconciled. 
The 
one, 
that 
the 
tooth 
of 
usury 
be 
grinded, 
that 
it 
bite 
not 
too 
much; 
the 
other, 
that 
there 
be 
left 
open 
a 
means, 
to 
invite 
moneyed 
men 
to 
lend 
to 
the 
merchants, 
for 
the 
continuing 
and 
quickening 
of 
trade. 
This 
cannot 
be 
done, 
except 
you 
introduce 
two 
several 
sorts 
of 
usury, 
a 
less 
and 
a 
greater. 
For 
if 
you 
reduce 
usury 
to 
one 
low 
rate, 
it 
will 
ease 
the 
common 
borrower, 
but 
the 
merchant 
will 
be 
to 
seek 
for 
money. 
And 
it 
is 
to 
be 
noted, 
that 
the 
trade 
of 
merchandize, 
being 
the 
most 
lucrative, 
may 
bear 
usury 
at 
a 
good 
rate; 
other 
contracts 
not 
so. 


To 
serve 
both 
intentions, 
the 
way 
would 
be 
briefly 
thus. 
That 
there 
be 
two 
rates 
of 
usury: 
the 
one 
free, 
and 
general 
for 
all; 
the 
other 
under 
license 
only, 
to 
certain 
persons, 
and 
in 
certain 
places 
of 
merchandizing. 
First, 



therefore, 
let 
usury 
in 
general, 
be 
reduced 
to 
five 
in 
the 
hundred; 
and 
let 
that 
rate 
be 
proclaimed, 
to 
be 
free 
and 
current; 
and 
let 
the 
state 
shut 
itself 
out, 
to 
take 
any 
penalty 
for 
the 
same. 
This 
will 
preserve 
borrowing, 
from 
any 
general 
stop 
or 
dryness. 
This 
will 
ease 
infinite 
borrowers 
in 
the 
country. 
This 
will, 
in 
good 
part, 
raise 
the 
price 
of 
land, 
because 
land 
purchased 
at 
sixteen 
years’ 
purchase 
will 
yield 
six 
in 
the 
hundred, 
and 
somewhat 
more; 
whereas 
this 
rate 
of 
interest, 
yields 
but 
five. 
This 
by 
like 
reason 
will 
encourage, 
and 
edge, 
industrious 
and 
profitable 
improvements; 
because 
many 
will 
rather 
venture 
in 
that 
kind, 
than 
take 
five 
in 
the 
hundred, 
especially 
having 
been 
used 
to 
greater 
profit. 
Secondly, 
let 
there 
be 
certain 
persons 
licensed, 
to 
lend 
to 
known 
merchants, 
upon 
usury 
at 
a 
higher 
rate; 
and 
let 
it 
be 
with 
the 
cautions 
following. 
Let 
the 
rate 
be, 
even 
with 
the 
merchant 
himself, 
somewhat 
more 
easy 
than 
that 
he 
used 
formerly 
to 
pay; 
for 
by 
that 
means, 
all 
borrowers, 
shall 
have 
some 
ease 
by 
this 
reformation, 
be 
he 
merchant, 
or 
whosoever. 
Let 
it 
be 
no 
bank 
or 
common 
stock, 
but 
every 
man 
be 
master 
of 
his 
own 
money. 
Not 
that 
I 
altogether 
mislike 
banks, 
but 
they 
will 
hardly 
be 
brooked, 
in 
regard 
of 
certain 
suspicions. 
Let 
the 
state 
be 
answered 
some 
small 
matter 
for 
the 
license, 
and 
the 
rest 
left 
to 
the 
lender; 
for 
if 
the 
abatement 
be 
but 
small, 
it 
will 
no 
whit 
discourage 
the 
lender. 
For 
he, 
for 
example, 
that 
took 
before 
ten 
or 
nine 
in 
the 
hundred, 
will 
sooner 
descend 
to 
eight 
in 
the 
hundred 
than 
give 
over 
his 
trade 
of 
usury, 
and 
go 
from 
certain 
gains, 
to 
gains 
of 
hazard. 
Let 
these 
licensed 
lenders 
be 
in 
number 
indefinite, 
but 
restrained 
to 
certain 
principal 
cities 
and 
towns 
of 
merchandizing; 
for 
then 
they 
will 
be 
hardly 
able 
to 
color 
other 
men’s 
moneys 
in 
the 
country: 
so 
as 
the 
license 
of 
nine 
will 
not 
suck 
away 
the 
current 
rate 
of 
five; 
for 
no 
man 
will 
send 
his 
moneys 
far 
off, 
nor 
put 
them 
into 
unknown 
hands. 


If 
it 
be 
objected 
that 
this 
doth 
in 
a 
sort 
authorize 
usury, 
which 
before, 
was 
in 
some 
places 
but 
permissive; 
the 
answer 
is, 
that 
it 
is 
better 
to 
mitigate 
usury, 
by 
declaration, 
than 
to 
suffer 
it 
to 
rage, 
by 
connivance. 



OF 
YOUTH 
AND 
AGE 


A 
man 
that 
is 
young 
in 
years, 
may 
be 
old 
in 
hours, 
if 
he 
have 
lost 
no 
time. 
But 
that 
happeneth 
rarely. 
Generally, 
youth 
is 
like 
the 
first 
cogitations, 
not 
so 
wise 
as 
the 
second. 
For 
there 
is 
a 
youth 
in 
thoughts, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
ages. 
And 
yet 
the 
invention 
of 
young 
men, 
is 
more 
lively 
than 
that 
of 
old; 
and 
imaginations 
stream 
into 
their 
minds 
better, 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
more 
divinely. 
Natures 
that 
have 
much 
heat, 
and 
great 
and 
violent 
desires 
and 
perturbations, 
are 
not 
ripe 
for 
action, 
till 
they 
have 
passed 
the 
meridian 
of 
their 
years; 
as 
it 
was 
with 
Julius 
Caesar 
and 
Septimius 
Severus. 
Of 
the 
latter, 
of 
whom 
it 
is 
said, 
Juventutem 
egit 
erroribus, 
imo 
furoribus, 
plenam. 
And 
yet 
he 
was 
the 
ablest 
emperor, 
almost, 
of 
all 
the 
list. 
But 
reposed 
natures 
may 
do 
well 
in 
youth. 
As 
it 
is 
seen 
in 
Augustus 
Caesar, 
Cosmus 
Duke 
of 
Florence, 
Gaston 
de 
Foix, 
and 
others. 
On 
the 
other 
side, 
heat 
and 
vivacity 
in 
age, 
is 
an 
excellent 
composition 
for 
business. 
Young 
men 
are 
fitter 
to 
invent, 
than 
to 
judge; 
fitter 
for 
execution, 
than 
for 
counsel; 
and 
fitter 
for 
new 
projects, 
than 
for 
settled 
business. 
For 
the 
experience 
of 
age, 
in 
things 
that 
fall 
within 
the 
compass 
of 
it, 
directeth 
them; 
but 
in 
new 
things, 
abuseth 
them. 


The 
errors 
of 
young 
men, 
are 
the 
ruin 
of 
business; 
but 
the 
errors 
of 
aged 
men, 
amount 
but 
to 
this, 
that 
more 
might 
have 
been 
done, 
or 
sooner. 
Young 
men, 
in 
the 
conduct 
and 
manage 
of 
actions, 
embrace 
more 
than 
they 
can 
hold; 
stir 
more 
than 
they 
can 
quiet; 
fly 
to 
the 
end, 
without 
consideration 
of 
the 
means 
and 
degrees; 
pursue 
some 
few 
principles, 
which 
they 
have 
chanced 
upon 
absurdly; 
care 
not 
to 
innovate, 
which 
draws 
unknown 
inconveniences; 
use 
extreme 
remedies 
at 
first; 
and, 
that 
which 
doubleth 
all 
errors, 
will 
not 
acknowledge 
or 
retract 
them; 
like 
an 
unready 
horse, 
that 
will 
neither 
stop 
nor 
turn. 
Men 
of 
age 
object 
too 
much, 
consult 
too 
long, 
adventure 
too 
little, 
repent 
too 
soon, 
and 
seldom 
drive 
business 
home 
to 
the 
full 
period, 
but 
content 
themselves 
with 
a 
mediocrity 
of 
success. 
Certainly 
it 
is 
good 
to 
compound 
employments 
of 
both; 
for 
that 
will 
be 
good 
for 
the 
present, 
because 
the 
virtues 
of 
either 
age, 
may 
correct 
the 
defects 
of 
both; 
and 
good 
for 
succession, 
that 
young 
men 
may 
be 
learners, 
while 
men 
in 
age 
are 
actors; 
and, 
lastly, 
good 
for 
extern 
accidents, 
because 
authority 
followeth 
old 



men, 
and 
favor 
and 
popularity, 
youth. 
But 
for 
the 
moral 
part, 
perhaps 
youth 
will 
have 
the 
pre-eminence, 
as 
age 
hath 
for 
the 
politic. 
A 
certain 
rabbin, 
upon 
the 
text, 
Your 
young 
men 
shall 
see 
visions, 
and 
your 
old 
men 
shall 
dream 
dreams, 
inferreth 
that 
young 
men, 
are 
admitted 
nearer 
to 
God 
than 
old, 
because 
vision, 
is 
a 
clearer 
revelation, 
than 
a 
dream. 
And 
certainly, 
the 
more 
a 
man 
drinketh 
of 
the 
world, 
the 
more 
it 
intoxicateth; 
and 
age 
doth 
profit 
rather 
in 
the 
powers 
of 
understanding, 
than 
in 
the 
virtues 
of 
the 
will 
and 
affections. 
There 
be 
some, 
have 
an 
over-early 
ripeness 
in 
their 
years, 
which 
fadeth 
betimes. 
These 
are, 
first, 
such 
as 
have 
brittle 
wits, 
the 
edge 
whereof 
is 
soon 
turned; 
such 
as 
was 
Hermogenes 
the 
rhetorician, 
whose 
books 
are 
exceeding 
subtle; 
who 
afterwards 
waxed 
stupid. 
A 
second 
sort, 
is 
of 
those 
that 
have 
some 
natural 
dispositions 
which 
have 
better 
grace 
in 
youth, 
than 
in 
age; 
such 
as 
is 
a 
fluent 
and 
luxuriant 
speech; 
which 
becomes 
youth 
well, 
but 
not 
age: 
so 
Tully 
saith 
of 
Hortensius, 
Idem 
manebat, 
neque 
idem 
decebat. 
The 
third 
is 
of 
such, 
as 
take 
too 
high 
a 
strain 
at 
the 
first, 
and 
are 
magnanimous, 
more 
than 
tract 
of 
years 
can 
uphold. 
As 
was 
Scipio 
Africanus, 
of 
whom 
Livy 
saith 
in 
effect, 
Ultima 
primis 
cedebant. 



OF 
BEAUTY 


Virtue 
is 
like 
a 
rich 
stone, 
best 
plain 
set; 
and 
surely 
virtue 
is 
best, 
in 
a 
body 
that 
is 
comely, 
though 
not 
of 
delicate 
features; 
and 
that 
hath 
rather 
dignity 
of 
presence, 
than 
beauty 
of 
aspect. 
Neither 
is 
it 
almost 
seen, 
that 
very 
beautiful 
persons 
are 
otherwise 
of 
great 
virtue; 
as 
if 
nature 
were 
rather 
busy, 
not 
to 
err, 
than 
in 
labor 
to 
produce 
excellency. 
And 
therefore 
they 
prove 
accomplished, 
but 
not 
of 
great 
spirit; 
and 
study 
rather 
behavior, 
than 
virtue. 
But 
this 
holds 
not 
always: 
for 
Augustus 
Caesar, 
Titus 
Vespasianus, 
Philip 
le 
Belle 
of 
France, 
Edward 
the 
Fourth 
of 
England, 
Alcibiades 
of 
Athens, 
Ismael 
the 
Sophy 
of 
Persia, 
were 
all 
high 
and 
great 
spirits; 
and 
yet 
the 
most 
beautiful 
men 
of 
their 
times. 
In 
beauty, 
that 
of 
favor, 
is 
more 
than 
that 
of 
color; 
and 
that 
of 
decent 
and 
gracious 
motion, 
more 
than 
that 
of 
favor. 
That 
is 
the 
best 
part 
of 
beauty, 
which 
a 
picture 
cannot 
express; 
no, 
nor 
the 
first 
sight 
of 
the 
life. 
There 
is 
no 
excellent 
beauty, 
that 
hath 
not 
some 
strangeness 
in 
the 
proportion. 
A 
man 
cannot 
tell 
whether 
Apelles, 
or 
Albert 
Durer, 
were 
the 
more 
trifler; 
whereof 
the 
one, 
would 
make 
a 
personage 
by 
geometrical 
proportions; 
the 
other, 
by 
taking 
the 
best 
parts 
out 
of 
divers 
faces, 
to 
make 
one 
excellent. 
Such 
personages, 
I 
think, 
would 
please 
nobody, 
but 
the 
painter 
that 
made 
them. 
Not 
but 
I 
think 
a 
painter 
may 
make 
a 
better 
face 
than 
ever 
was; 
but 
he 
must 
do 
it 
by 
a 
kind 
of 
felicity 
(as 
a 
musician 
that 
maketh 
an 
excellent 
air 
in 
music), 
and 
not 
by 
rule. 
A 
man 
shall 
see 
faces, 
that 
if 
you 
examine 
them 
part 
by 
part, 
you 
shall 
find 
never 
a 
good; 
and 
yet 
altogether 
do 
well. 
If 
it 
be 
true 
that 
the 
principal 
part 
of 
beauty 
is 
in 
decent 
motion, 
certainly 
it 
is 
no 
marvel, 
though 
persons 
in 
years 
seem 
many 
times 
more 
amiable; 
pulchrorum 
autumnus 
pulcher; 
for 
no 
youth 
can 
be 
comely 
but 
by 
pardon, 
and 
considering 
the 
youth, 
as 
to 
make 
up 
the 
comeliness. 
Beauty 
is 
as 
summer 
fruits, 
which 
are 
easy 
to 
corrupt, 
and 
cannot 
last; 
and 
for 
the 
most 
part 
it 
makes 
a 
dissolute 
youth, 
and 
an 
age 
a 
little 
out 
of 
countenance; 
but 
yet 
certainly 
again, 
if 
it 
light 
well, 
it 
maketh 
virtue 
shine, 
and 
vices 
blush. 



OF 
DEFORMITY 


Deformed 
persons 
are 
commonly 
even 
with 
nature; 
for 
as 
nature 
hath 
done 
ill 
by 
them, 
so 
do 
they 
by 
nature; 
being 
for 
the 
most 
part 
(as 
the 
Scripture 
saith) 
void 
of 
natural 
affection; 
and 
so 
they 
have 
their 
revenge 
of 
nature. 
Certainly 
there 
is 
a 
consent, 
between 
the 
body 
and 
the 
mind; 
and 
where 
nature 
erreth 
in 
the 
one, 
she 
ventureth 
in 
the 
other. 
Ubi 
peccat 
in 
uno, 
periclitatur 
in 
altero. 
But 
because 
there 
is, 
in 
man, 
an 
election 
touching 
the 
frame 
of 
his 
mind, 
and 
a 
necessity 
in 
the 
frame 
of 
his 
body, 
the 
stars 
of 
natural 
inclination 
are 
sometimes 
obscured, 
by 
the 
sun 
of 
discipline 
and 
virtue. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
good 
to 
consider 
of 
deformity, 
not 
as 
a 
sign, 
which 
is 
more 
deceivable; 
but 
as 
a 
cause, 
which 
seldom 
faileth 
of 
the 
effect. 
Whosoever 
hath 
anything 
fixed 
in 
his 
person, 
that 
doth 
induce 
contempt, 
hath 
also 
a 
perpetual 
spur 
in 
himself, 
to 
rescue 
and 
deliver 
himself 
from 
scorn. 
Therefore 
all 
deformed 
persons, 
are 
extreme 
bold. 
First, 
as 
in 
their 
own 
defence, 
as 
being 
exposed 
to 
scorn; 
but 
in 
process 
of 
time, 
by 
a 
general 
habit. 
Also 
it 
stirreth 
in 
them 
industry, 
and 
especially 
of 
this 
kind, 
to 
watch 
and 
observe 
the 
weakness 
of 
others, 
that 
they 
may 
have 
somewhat 
to 
repay. 
Again, 
in 
their 
superiors, 
it 
quencheth 
jealousy 
towards 
them, 
as 
persons 
that 
they 
think 
they 
may, 
at 
pleasure, 
despise: 
and 
it 
layeth 
their 
competitors 
and 
emulators 
asleep; 
as 
never 
believing 
they 
should 
be 
in 
possibility 
of 
advancement, 
till 
they 
see 
them 
in 
possession. 
So 
that 
upon 
the 
matter, 
in 
a 
great 
wit, 
deformity 
is 
an 
advantage 
to 
rising. 
Kings 
in 
ancient 
times 
(and 
at 
this 
present 
in 
some 
countries) 
were 
wont 
to 
put 
great 
trust 
in 
eunuchs; 
because 
they 
that 
are 
envious 
towards 
all 
are 
more 
obnoxious 
and 
officious, 
towards 
one. 
But 
yet 
their 
trust 
towards 
them, 
hath 
rather 
been 
as 
to 
good 
spials, 
and 
good 
whisperers, 
than 
good 
magistrates 
and 
officers. 
And 
much 
like 
is 
the 
reason 
of 
deformed 
persons. 
Still 
the 
ground 
is, 
they 
will, 
if 
they 
be 
of 
spirit, 
seek 
to 
free 
themselves 
from 
scorn; 
which 
must 
be 
either 
by 
virtue 
or 
malice; 
and 
therefore 
let 
it 
not 
be 
marvelled, 
if 
sometimes 
they 
prove 
excellent 
persons; 
as 
was 
Agesilaus, 
Zanger 
the 
son 
of 
Solyman, 
AEsop, 
Gasca, 
President 
of 
Peru; 
and 
Socrates 
may 
go 
likewise 
amongst 
them; 
with 
others. 



 
OF 
BUILDING 


Houses 
are 
built 
to 
live 
in, 
and 
not 
to 
look 
on; 
therefore 
let 
use 
be 
preferred 
before 
uniformity, 
except 
where 
both 
may 
be 
had. 
Leave 
the 
goodly 
fabrics 
of 
houses, 
for 
beauty 
only, 
to 
the 
enchanted 
palaces 
of 
the 
poets; 
who 
build 
them 
with 
small 
cost. 
He 
that 
builds 
a 
fair 
house, 
upon 
an 
ill 
seat, 
committeth 
himself 
to 
prison. 
Neither 
do 
I 
reckon 
it 
an 
ill 
seat, 
only 
where 
the 
air 
is 
unwholesome; 
but 
likewise 
where 
the 
air 
is 
unequal; 
as 
you 
shall 
see 
many 
fine 
seats 
set 
upon 
a 
knap 
of 
ground, 
environed 
with 
higher 
hills 
round 
about 
it; 
whereby 
the 
heat 
of 
the 
sun 
is 
pent 
in, 
and 
the 
wind 
gathereth 
as 
in 
troughs; 
so 
as 
you 
shall 
have, 
and 
that 
suddenly, 
as 
great 
diversity 
of 
heat 
and 
cold 
as 
if 
you 
dwelt 
in 
several 
places. 
Neither 
is 
it 
ill 
air 
only 
that 
maketh 
an 
ill 
seat, 
but 
ill 
ways, 
ill 
markets; 
and, 
if 
you 
will 
consult 
with 
Momus, 
ill 
neighbors. 
I 
speak 
not 
of 
many 
more; 
want 
of 
water; 
want 
of 
wood, 
shade, 
and 
shelter; 
want 
of 
fruitfulness, 
and 
mixture 
of 
grounds 
of 
several 
natures; 
want 
of 
prospect; 
want 
of 
level 
grounds; 
want 
of 
places 
at 
some 
near 
distance 
for 
sports 
of 
hunting, 
hawking, 
and 
races; 
too 
near 
the 
sea, 
too 
remote; 
having 
the 
commodity 
of 
navigable 
rivers, 
or 
the 
discommodity 
of 
their 
overflowing; 
too 
far 
off 
from 
great 
cities, 
which 
may 
hinder 
business, 
or 
too 
near 
them, 
which 
lurcheth 
all 
provisions, 
and 
maketh 
everything 
dear; 
where 
a 
man 
hath 
a 
great 
living 
laid 
together, 
and 
where 
he 
is 
scanted: 
all 
which, 
as 
it 
is 
impossible 
perhaps 
to 
find 
together, 
so 
it 
is 
good 
to 
know 
them, 
and 
think 
of 
them, 
that 
a 
man 
may 
take 
as 
many 
as 
he 
can; 
and 
if 
he 
have 
several 
dwellings, 
that 
he 
sort 
them 
so, 
that 
what 
he 
wanteth 
in 
the 
one, 
he 
may 
find 
in 
the 
other. 
Lucullus 
answered 
Pompey 
well; 
who, 
when 
he 
saw 
his 
stately 
galleries, 
and 
rooms 
so 
large 
and 
lightsome, 
in 
one 
of 
his 
houses, 
said, 
Surely 
an 
excellent 
place 
for 
summer, 
but 
how 
do 
you 
in 
winter? 
Lucullus 
answered, 
Why, 
do 
you 
not 
think 
me 
as 
wise 
as 
some 
fowl 
are, 
that 
ever 
change 
their 
abode 
towards 
the 
winter? 


To 
pass 
from 
the 
seat, 
to 
the 
house 
itself; 
we 
will 
do 
as 
Cicero 
doth 
in 
the 
orator’s 
art; 
who 
writes 
books 
De 
Oratore, 
and 
a 
book 
he 
entitles 
Orator; 
whereof 
the 
former, 
delivers 
the 
precepts 
of 
the 
art, 
and 
the 
latter, 
the 
perfection. 
We 
will 
therefore 
describe 
a 
princely 
palace, 
making 
a 
brief 



model 
thereof. 
For 
it 
is 
strange 
to 
see, 
now 
in 
Europe, 
such 
huge 
buildings 
as 
the 
Vatican 
and 
Escurial 
and 
some 
others 
be, 
and 
yet 
scarce 
a 
very 
fair 
room 
in 
them. 


First, 
therefore, 
I 
say 
you 
cannot 
have 
a 
perfect 
palace 
except 
you 
have 
two 
several 
sides; 
a 
side 
for 
the 
banquet, 
as 
it 
is 
spoken 
of 
in 
the 
book 
of 
Hester, 
and 
a 
side 
for 
the 
household; 
the 
one 
for 
feasts 
and 
triumphs, 
and 
the 
other 
for 
dwelling. 
I 
understand 
both 
these 
sides 
to 
be 
not 
only 
returns, 
but 
parts 
of 
the 
front; 
and 
to 
be 
uniform 
without, 
though 
severally 
partitioned 
within; 
and 
to 
be 
on 
both 
sides 
of 
a 
great 
and 
stately 
tower, 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
front, 
that, 
as 
it 
were, 
joineth 
them 
together 
on 
either 
hand. 
I 
would 
have 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
banquet, 
in 
front, 
one 
only 
goodly 
room 
above 
stairs, 
of 
some 
forty 
foot 
high; 
and 
under 
it 
a 
room 
for 
a 
dressing, 
or 
preparing 
place, 
at 
times 
of 
triumphs. 
On 
the 
other 
side, 
which 
is 
the 
household 
side, 
I 
wish 
it 
divided 
at 
the 
first, 
into 
a 
hall 
and 
a 
chapel 
(with 
a 
partition 
between); 
both 
of 
good 
state 
and 
bigness; 
and 
those 
not 
to 
go 
all 
the 
length, 
but 
to 
have 
at 
the 
further 
end, 
a 
winter 
and 
a 
summer 
parlor, 
both 
fair. 
And 
under 
these 
rooms, 
a 
fair 
and 
large 
cellar, 
sunk 
under 
ground; 
and 
likewise 
some 
privy 
kitchens, 
with 
butteries 
and 
pantries, 
and 
the 
like. 
As 
for 
the 
tower, 
I 
would 
have 
it 
two 
stories, 
of 
eighteen 
foot 
high 
apiece, 
above 
the 
two 
wings; 
and 
a 
goodly 
leads 
upon 
the 
top, 
railed 
with 
statuas 
interposed; 
and 
the 
same 
tower 
to 
be 
divided 
into 
rooms, 
as 
shall 
be 
thought 
fit. 
The 
stairs 
likewise 
to 
the 
upper 
rooms, 
let 
them 
be 
upon 
a 
fair 
open 
newel, 
and 
finely 
railed 
in, 
with 
images 
of 
wood, 
cast 
into 
a 
brass 
color; 
and 
a 
very 
fair 
landing-place 
at 
the 
top. 
But 
this 
to 
be, 
if 
you 
do 
not 
point 
any 
of 
the 
lower 
rooms, 
for 
a 
dining 
place 
of 
servants. 
For 
otherwise, 
you 
shall 
have 
the 
servants’ 
dinner 
after 
your 
own: 
for 
the 
steam 
of 
it, 
will 
come 
up 
as 
in 
a 
tunnel. 
And 
so 
much 
for 
the 
front. 
Only 
I 
understand 
the 
height 
of 
the 
first 
stairs 
to 
be 
sixteen 
foot, 
which 
is 
the 
height 
of 
the 
lower 
room. 


Beyond 
this 
front, 
is 
there 
to 
be 
a 
fair 
court, 
but 
three 
sides 
of 
it, 
of 
a 
far 
lower 
building 
than 
the 
front. 
And 
in 
all 
the 
four 
corners 
of 
that 
court, 
fair 
staircases, 
cast 
into 
turrets, 
on 
the 
outside, 
and 
not 
within 
the 
row 
of 
buildings 
themselves. 
But 
those 
towers, 
are 
not 
to 
be 
of 
the 
height 
of 
the 
front, 
but 
rather 
proportionable 
to 
the 
lower 
building. 
Let 
the 
court 
not 
be 
paved, 
for 
that 
striketh 
up 
a 
great 
heat 
in 
summer, 
and 
much 
cold 
in 
winter. 
But 
only 
some 
side 
alleys, 
with 
a 
cross, 
and 
the 
quarters 
to 
graze, 
being 
kept 
shorn, 
but 
not 
too 
near 
shorn. 
The 
row 
of 
return 
on 
the 
banquet 
side, 
let 
it 
be 



all 
stately 
galleries: 
in 
which 
galleiies 
let 
there 
be 
three, 
or 
five, 
fine 
cupolas 
in 
the 
length 
of 
it, 
placed 
at 
equal 
distance; 
and 
fine 
colored 
windows 
of 
several 
works. 
On 
the 
household 
side, 
chambers 
of 
presence 
and 
ordinary 
entertainments, 
with 
some 
bed-chambers; 
and 
let 
all 
three 
sides 
be 
a 
double 
house, 
without 
thorough 
lights 
on 
the 
sides, 
that 
you 
may 
have 
rooms 
from 
the 
sun, 
both 
for 
forenoon 
and 
afternoon. 
Cast 
it 
also, 
that 
you 
may 
have 
rooms, 
both 
for 
summer 
and 
winter; 
shady 
for 
summer, 
and 
warm 
for 
winter. 
You 
shall 
have 
sometimes 
fair 
houses 
so 
full 
of 
glass, 
that 
one 
cannot 
tell 
where 
to 
become, 
to 
be 
out 
of 
the 
sun 
or 
cold. 
For 
inbowed 
windows, 
I 
hold 
them 
of 
good 
use 
(in 
cities, 
indeed, 
upright 
do 
better, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
uniformity 
towards 
the 
street); 
for 
they 
be 
pretty 
retiring 
places 
for 
conference; 
and 
besides, 
they 
keep 
both 
the 
wind 
and 
sun 
off; 
for 
that 
which 
would 
strike 
almost 
through 
the 
room, 
doth 
scarce 
pass 
the 
window. 
But 
let 
them 
be 
but 
few, 
four 
in 
the 
court, 
on 
the 
sides 
only. 


Beyond 
this 
court, 
let 
there 
be 
an 
inward 
court, 
of 
the 
same 
square 
and 
height; 
which 
is 
to 
be 
environed 
with 
the 
garden 
on 
all 
sides; 
and 
in 
the 
inside, 
cloistered 
on 
all 
sides, 
upon 
decent 
and 
beautiful 
arches, 
as 
high 
as 
the 
first 
story. 
On 
the 
under 
story, 
towards 
the 
garden, 
let 
it 
be 
turned 
to 
a 
grotto, 
or 
a 
place 
of 
shade, 
or 
estivation. 
And 
only 
have 
opening 
and 
windows 
towards 
the 
garden; 
and 
be 
level 
upon 
the 
floor, 
no 
whit 
sunken 
under 
ground, 
to 
avoid 
all 
dampishness. 
And 
let 
there 
be 
a 
fountain, 
or 
some 
fair 
work 
of 
statuas, 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
this 
court; 
and 
to 
be 
paved 
as 
the 
other 
court 
was. 
These 
buildings 
to 
be 
for 
privy 
lodgings 
on 
both 
sides; 
and 
the 
end 
for 
privy 
galleries. 
Whereof 
you 
must 
foresee 
that 
one 
of 
them 
be 
for 
an 
infirmary, 
if 
the 
prince 
or 
any 
special 
person 
should 
be 
sick, 
with 
chambers, 
bed-chamber, 
antecamera, 
and 
recamera 
joining 
to 
it. 
This 
upon 
the 
second 
story. 
Upon 
the 
ground 
story, 
a 
fair 
gallery, 
open, 
upon 
pillars; 
and 
upon 
the 
third 
story 
likewise, 
an 
open 
gallery, 
upon 
pillars, 
to 
take 
the 
prospect 
and 
freshness 
of 
the 
garden. 
At 
both 
corners 
of 
the 
further 
side, 
by 
way 
of 
return, 
let 
there 
be 
two 
delicate 
or 
rich 
cabinets, 
daintily 
paved, 
richly 
hanged, 
glazed 
with 
crystalline 
glass, 
and 
a 
rich 
cupola 
in 
the 
midst; 
and 
all 
other 
elegancy 
that 
may 
be 
thought 
upon. 
In 
the 
upper 
gallery 
tool 
I 
wish 
that 
there 
may 
be, 
if 
the 
place 
will 
yield 
it, 
some 
fountains 
running 
in 
divers 
places 
from 
the 
wall, 
with 
some 
fine 
avoidances. 
And 
thus 
much 
for 
the 
model 
of 
the 
palace; 
save 
that 
you 
must 
have, 
before 
you 
come 
to 
the 
front, 
three 
courts. 
A 
green 
court 
plain, 
with 
a 
wall 
about 
it; 
a 
second 
court 
of 
the 
same, 
but 
more 
garnished, 
with 
little 
turrets, 
or 
rather 
embellishments, 
upon 
the 



wall; 
and 
a 
third 
court, 
to 
make 
a 
square 
with 
the 
front, 
but 
not 
to 
be 
built, 
nor 
yet 
enclosed 
with 
a 
naked 
wall, 
but 
enclosed 
with 
terraces, 
leaded 
aloft, 
and 
fairly 
garnished, 
on 
the 
three 
sides; 
and 
cloistered 
on 
the 
inside, 
with 
pillars, 
and 
not 
with 
arches 
below. 
As 
for 
offices, 
let 
them 
stand 
at 
distance, 
with 
some 
low 
galleries, 
to 
pass 
from 
them 
to 
the 
palace 
itself. 



OF 
GARDENS 


God 
Almighty 
planted 
a 
garden. 
And 
indeed 
it 
is 
the 
purest 
of 
human 
pleasures. 
It 
is 
the 
greatest 
refreshment 
to 
the 
spirits 
of 
man; 
without 
which, 
buildings 
and 
palaces 
are 
but 
gross 
handiworks; 
and 
a 
man 
shall 
ever 
see, 
that 
when 
ages 
grow 
to 
civility 
and 
elegancy, 
men 
come 
to 
build 
stately 
sooner 
than 
to 
garden 
finely; 
as 
if 
gardening 
were 
the 
greater 
perfection. 
I 
do 
hold 
it, 
in 
the 
royal 
ordering 
of 
gardens, 
there 
ought 
to 
be 
gardens, 
for 
all 
the 
months 
in 
the 
year; 
in 
which 
severally 
things 
of 
beauty 
may 
be 
then 
in 
season. 
For 
December, 
and 
January, 
and 
the 
latter 
part 
of 
November, 
you 
must 
take 
such 
things 
as 
are 
green 
all 
winter: 
holly; 
ivy; 
bays; 
juniper; 
cypress-trees; 
yew; 
pine-apple-trees; 
fir-trees; 
rosemary; 
lavender; 
periwinkle, 
the 
white, 
the 
purple, 
and 
the 
blue; 
germander; 
flags; 
orange-
trees; 
lemon-trees; 
and 
myrtles, 
if 
they 
be 
stoved; 
and 
sweet 
marjoram, 
warm 
set. 
There 
followeth, 
for 
the 
latter 
part 
of 
January 
and 
February, 
the 
mezereon-tree, 
which 
then 
blossoms; 
crocus 
vernus, 
both 
the 
yellow 
and 
the 
grey; 
primroses; 
anemones; 
the 
early 
tulippa;

medlars; 
bullaces; 
roses 
cut 
or 
removed 
to 
come 
late; 
hollyhocks; 
and 
such 
like. 
These 
particulars 
are 
for 
the 
climate 
of 
London; 
but 
my 
meaning 
is 
perceived, 
that 
you 
may 
have 
ver 
perpetuum, 
as 
the 
place 
affords. 


And 
because 
the 
breath 
of 
flowers 
is 
far 
sweeter 
in 
the 
air 
(where 
it 
comes 
and 
goes 
like 
the 
warbling 
of 
music) 
than 
in 
the 
hand, 
therefore 
nothing 
is 
more 
fit 
for 
that 
delight, 
than 
to 
know 
what 
be 
the 
flowers 
and 
plants 
that 
do 
best 
perfume 
the 
air. 
Roses, 
damask 
and 
red, 
are 
fast 
flowers 
of 
their 
smells; 
so 
that 
you 
may 
walk 
by 
a 
whole 
row 
of 
them, 
and 
find 
nothing 
of 
their 
sweetness; 
yea 
though 
it 
be 
in 
a 
moming’s 
dew. 
Bays 
likewise 
yield 
no 
smell 
as 
they 
grow. 
Rosemary 
little; 
nor 
sweet 
marjoram. 
That 
which 
above 
all 
others 
yields 
the 
sweetest 
smell 
in 
the 
air 
is 
the 
violet, 
specially 
the 
white 
double 
violet, 
which 
comes 
twice 
a 
year; 
about 
the 
middle 
of 
April, 
and 
about 
Bartholomew-tide. 
Next 
to 
that 
is 
the 
musk-rose. 
Then 
the 
strawberry-
leaves 
dying, 
which 
yield 
a 
most 
excellent 
cordial 
smell. 
Then 
the 
flower 
of 
vines; 
it 
is 
a 
little 
dust, 
like 
the 
dust 
of 
a 
bent, 
which 
grows 
upon 
the 
cluster 
in 
the 
first 
coming 
forth. 
Then 
sweet-briar. 
Then 
wall-flowers, 
which 
are 
very 
delightful 
to 
be 
set 
under 
a 
parlor 
or 
lower 
chamber 
window. 
Then 
pinks 
and 
gilliflowers, 
especially 
the 
matted 
pink 
and 
clove 
gilliflower. 
Then 
the 
flowers 
of 
the 
lime-tree. 
Then 
the 
honeysuckles, 
so 
they 
be 
somewhat 
afar 
off. 
Of 
beanflowers 
I 
speak 
not, 
because 
they 
are 
field 
flowers. 
But 
those 
which 
perfume 
the 
air 
most 
delightfully, 
not 
passed 
by 
as 
the 
rest, 
but 
being 
trodden 
upon 
and 
crushed, 
are 
three; 
that 
is, 
burnet, 
wild-thyme, 
and 
watermints. 
Therefore 
you 
are 
to 
set 
whole 
alleys 
of 
them, 
to 
have 
the 
pleasure 
when 
you 
walk 
or 
tread. 


For 
gardens 
(speaking 
of 
those 
which 
are 
indeed 
princelike, 
as 
we 
have 
done 
of 
buildings), 
the 
contents 
ought 
not 
well 
to 
be 
under 
thirty 
acres 
of 
ground; 
and 
to 
be 
divided 
into 
three 
parts; 
a 
green 
in 
the 
entrance; 
a 
heath 
or 
desert 
in 
the 
going 
forth; 
and 
the 
main 
garden 
in 
the 
midst; 
besides 
alleys 
on 
both 
sides. 
And 
I 
like 
well 
that 
four 
acres 
of 
ground 
be 
assigned 
to 
the 
green; 
six 
to 
the 
heath; 
four 
and 
four 
to 
either 
side; 
and 
twelve 
to 
the 
main 
garden. 
The 
green 
hath 
two 
pleasures: 
the 
one, 
because 
nothing 
is 
more 
pleasant 
to 
the 
eye 
than 
green 
grass 
kept 
finely 
shorn; 
the 
other, 
because 
it 
will 
give 
you 
a 
fair 
alley 
in 
the 
midst, 
by 
which 
you 
may 
go 
in 
front 
upon 
a 
stately 
hedge, 
which 
is 
to 
enclose 
the 
garden. 
But 
because 
the 
alley 
will 
be 



long, 
and, 
in 
great 
heat 
of 
the 
year 
or 
day, 
you 
ought 
not 
to 
buy 
the 
shade 
in 
the 
garden, 
by 
going 
in 
the 
sun 
through 
the 
green, 
therefore 
you 
are, 
of 
either 
side 
the 
green, 
to 
plant 
a 
covert 
alley 
upon 
carpenter’s 
work, 
about 
twelve 
foot 
in 
height, 
by 
which 
you 
may 
go 
in 
shade 
into 
the 
garden. 
As 
for 
the 
making 
of 
knots 
or 
figures, 
with 
divers 
colored 
earths, 
that 
they 
may 
lie 
under 
the 
windows 
of 
the 
house 
on 
that 
side 
which 
the 
garden 
stands, 
they 
be 
but 
toys; 
you 
may 
see 
as 
good 
sights, 
many 
times, 
in 
tarts. 
The 
garden 
is 
best 
to 
be 
square, 
encompassed 
on 
all 
the 
four 
sides 
with 
a 
stately 
arched 
hedge. 
The 
arches 
to 
be 
upon 
pillars 
of 
carpenter’s 
work, 
of 
some 
ten 
foot 
high, 
and 
six 
foot 
broad; 
and 
the 
spaces 
between 
of 
the 
same 
dimension 
with 
the 
breadth 
of 
the 
arch. 
Over 
the 
arches 
let 
there 
be 
an 
entire 
hedge 
of 
some 
four 
foot 
high, 
framed 
also 
upon 
carpenter’s 
work; 
and 
upon 
the 
upper 
hedge, 
over 
every 
arch, 
a 
little 
turret, 
with 
a 
belly, 
enough 
to 
receive 
a 
cage 
of 
birds: 
and 
over 
every 
space 
between 
the 
arches 
some 
other 
little 
figure, 
with 
broad 
plates 
of 
round 
colored 
glass 
gilt, 
for 
the 
sun 
to 
play 
upon. 
But 
this 
hedge 
I 
intend 
to 
be 
raised 
upon 
a 
bank, 
not 
steep, 
but 
gently 
slope, 
of 
some 
six 
foot, 
set 
all 
with 
flowers. 
Also 
I 
understand, 
that 
this 
square 
of 
the 
garden, 
should 
not 
be 
the 
whole 
breadth 
of 
the 
ground, 
but 
to 
leave 
on 
either 
side, 
ground 
enough 
for 
diversity 
of 
side 
alleys; 
unto 
which 
the 
two 
covert 
alleys 
of 
the 
green, 
may 
deliver 
you. 
But 
there 
must 
be 
no 
alleys 
with 
hedges, 
at 
either 
end 
of 
this 
great 
enclosure; 
not 
at 
the 
hither 
end, 
for 
letting 
your 
prospect 
upon 
this 
fair 
hedge 
from 
the 
green; 
nor 
at 
the 
further 
end, 
for 
letting 
your 
prospect 
from 
the 
hedge, 
through 
the 
arches 
upon 
the 
heath. 


For 
the 
ordering 
of 
the 
ground, 
within 
the 
great 
hedge, 
I 
leave 
it 
to 
variety 
of 
device; 
advising 
nevertheless, 
that 
whatsoever 
form 
you 
cast 
it 
into, 
first, 
it 
be 
not 
too 
busy, 
or 
full 
of 
work. 
Wherein 
I, 
for 
my 
part, 
do 
not 
like 
images 
cut 
out 
in 
juniper 
or 
other 
garden 
stuff; 
they 
be 
for 
children. 
Little 
low 
hedges, 
round, 
like 
welts, 
with 
some 
pretty 
pyramids, 
I 
like 
well; 
and 
in 
some 
places, 
fair 
columns 
upon 
frames 
of 
carpenter’s 
work. 
I 
would 
also 
have 
the 
alleys, 
spacious 
and 
fair. 
You 
may 
have 
closer 
alleys, 
upon 
the 
side 
grounds, 
but 
none 
in 
the 
main 
garden. 
I 
wish 
also, 
in 
the 
very 
middle 
a 
fair 
mount, 
with 
three 
ascents, 
and 
alleys, 
enough 
for 
four 
to 
walk 
abreast; 
which 
I 
would 
have 
to 
be 
perfect 
circles, 
without 
any 
bulwarks 
or 
embossments; 
and 
the 
whole 
mount 
to 
be 
thirty 
foot 
high; 
and 
some 
fine 
banqueting-house, 
with 
some 
chimneys 
neatly 
cast, 
and 
without 
too 
much 
glass. 


For 
fountains, 
they 
are 
a 
great 
beauty 
and 
refreshment; 
but 
pools 
mar 



all, 
and 
make 
the 
garden 
unwholesome, 
and 
full 
of 
flies 
and 
frogs. 
Fountains 
I 
intend 
to 
be 
of 
two 
natures: 
the 
one 
that 
sprinkleth 
or 
spouteth 
water; 
the 
other 
a 
fair 
receipt 
of 
water, 
of 
some 
thirty 
or 
forty 
foot 
square, 
but 
without 
fish, 
or 
slime, 
or 
mud. 
For 
the 
first, 
the 
ornaments 
of 
images 
gilt, 
or 
of 
marble, 
which 
are 
in 
use, 
do 
well: 
but 
the 
main 
matter 
is 
so 
to 
convey 
the 
water, 
as 
it 
never 
stay, 
either 
in 
the 
bowls 
or 
in 
the 
cistern; 
that 
the 
water 
be 
never 
by 
rest 
discolored, 
green 
or 
red 
or 
the 
like; 
or 
gather 
any 
mossiness 
or 
putrefaction. 
Besides 
that, 
it 
is 
to 
be 
cleansed 
every 
day 
by 
the 
hand. 
Also 
some 
steps 
up 
to 
it, 
and 
some 
fine 
pavement 
about 
it, 
doth 
well. 
As 
for 
the 
other 
kind 
of 
fountain, 
which 
we 
may 
call 
a 
bathing 
pool, 
it 
may 
admit 
much 
curiosity 
and 
beauty; 
wherewith 
we 
will 
not 
trouble 
ourselves: 
as, 
that 
the 
bottom 
be 
finely 
paved, 
and 
with 
images; 
the 
sides 
likewise; 
and 
withal 
embellished 
with 
colored 
glass, 
and 
such 
things 
of 
lustre; 
encompassed 
also 
with 
fine 
rails 
of 
low 
statuas. 
But 
the 
main 
point 
is 
the 
same 
which 
we 
mentioned 
in 
the 
former 
kind 
of 
fountain; 
which 
is, 
that 
the 
water 
be 
in 
perpetual 
motion, 
fed 
by 
a 
water 
higher 
than 
the 
pool, 
and 
delivered 
into 
it 
by 
fair 
spouts, 
and 
then 
discharged 
away 
under 
ground, 
by 
some 
equality 
of 
bores, 
that 
it 
stay 
little. 
And 
for 
fine 
devices, 
of 
arching 
water 
without 
spilling, 
and 
making 
it 
rise 
in 
several 
forms 
(of 
feathers, 
drinking 
glasses, 
canopies, 
and 
the 
like), 
they 
be 
pretty 
things 
to 
look 
on, 
but 
nothing 
to 
health 
and 
sweetness. 


For 
the 
heath, 
which 
was 
the 
third 
part 
of 
our 
plot, 
I 
wish 
it 
to 
be 
framed, 
as 
much 
as 
may 
be, 
to 
a 
natural 
wildness. 
Trees 
I 
would 
have 
none 
in 
it, 
but 
some 
thickets 
made 
only 
of 
sweet-briar 
and 
honeysuckle, 
and 
some 
wild 
vine 
amongst; 
and 
the 
ground 
set 
with 
violets, 
strawberries, 
and 
primroses. 
For 
these 
are 
sweet, 
and 
prosper 
in 
the 
shade. 
And 
these 
to 
be 
in 
the 
heath, 
here 
and 
there, 
not 
in 
any 
order. 
I 
like 
also 
little 
heaps, 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
mole-hills 
(such 
as 
are 
in 
wild 
heaths), 
to 
be 
set, 
some 
with 
wild 
thyme; 
some 
with 
pinks; 
some 
with 
germander, 
that 
gives 
a 
good 
flower 
to 
the 
eye; 
some 
with 
periwinkle; 
some 
with 
violets; 
some 
with 
strawberries; 
some 
with 
cowslips; 
some 
with 
daisies; 
some 
with 
red 
roses; 
some 
with 
lilium 
convallium; 
some 
with 
sweet-williams 
red; 
some 
with 
bear’s-foot: 
and 
the 
like 
low 
flowers, 
being 
withal 
sweet 
and 
sightly. 
Part 
of 
which 
heaps, 
are 
to 
be 
with 
standards 
of 
little 
bushes 
pricked 
upon 
their 
top, 
and 
part 
without. 
The 
standards 
to 
be 
roses; 
juniper; 
hory; 
berberries 
(but 
here 
and 
there, 
because 
of 
the 
smell 
of 
their 
blossoms); 
red 
currants; 
gooseberries; 
rosemary; 
bays; 
sweetbriar; 
and 
such 
like. 
But 
these 
standards 
to 
be 
kept 
with 
cutting, 



that 
they 
grow 
not 
out 
of 
course. 


For 
the 
side 
grounds, 
you 
are 
to 
fill 
them 
with 
variety 
of 
alleys, 
private, 
to 
give 
a 
full 
shade, 
some 
of 
them, 
wheresoever 
the 
sun 
be. 
You 
are 
to 
frame 
some 
of 
them, 
likewise, 
for 
shelter, 
that 
when 
the 
wind 
blows 
sharp 
you 
may 
walk 
as 
in 
a 
gallery. 
And 
those 
alleys 
must 
be 
likewise 
hedged 
at 
both 
ends, 
to 
keep 
out 
the 
wind; 
and 
these 
closer 
alleys 
must 
be 
ever 
finely 
gravelled, 
and 
no 
grass, 
because 
of 
going 
wet. 
In 
many 
of 
these 
alleys, 
likewise, 
you 
are 
to 
set 
fruit-trees 
of 
all 
sorts; 
as 
well 
upon 
the 
walls, 
as 
in 
ranges. 
And 
this 
would 
be 
generally 
observed, 
that 
the 
borders 
wherein 
you 
plant 
your 
fruit-trees, 
be 
fair 
and 
large, 
and 
low, 
and 
not 
steep; 
and 
set 
with 
fine 
flowers, 
but 
thin 
and 
sparingly, 
lest 
they 
deceive 
the 
trees. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
both 
the 
side 
grounds, 
I 
would 
have 
a 
mount 
of 
some 
pretty 
height, 
leaving 
the 
wall 
of 
the 
enclosure 
breast 
high, 
to 
look 
abroad 
into 
the 
fields. 


For 
the 
main 
garden, 
I 
do 
not 
deny, 
but 
there 
should 
be 
some 
fair 
alleys 
ranged 
on 
both 
sides, 
with 
fruit-trees; 
and 
some 
pretty 
tufts 
of 
fruit-
trees; 
and 
arbors 
with 
seats, 
set 
in 
some 
decent 
order; 
but 
these 
to 
be 
by 
no 
means 
set 
too 
thick; 
but 
to 
leave 
the 
main 
garden 
so 
as 
it 
be 
not 
close, 
but 
the 
air 
open 
and 
free. 
For 
as 
for 
shade, 
I 
would 
have 
you 
rest 
upon 
the 
alleys 
of 
the 
side 
grounds, 
there 
to 
walk, 
if 
you 
be 
disposed, 
in 
the 
heat 
of 
the 
year 
or 
day; 
but 
to 
make 
account, 
that 
the 
main 
garden 
is 
for 
the 
more 
temperate 
parts 
of 
the 
year; 
and 
in 
the 
heat 
of 
summer, 
for 
the 
morning 
and 
the 
evening, 
or 
overcast 
days. 


For 
aviaries, 
I 
like 
them 
not, 
except 
they 
be 
of 
that 
largeness 
as 
they 
may 
be 
turfed, 
and 
have 
living 
plants 
and 
bushes 
set 
in 
them; 
that 
the 
birds 
may 
have 
more 
scope, 
and 
natural 
nestling, 
and 
that 
no 
foulness 
appear 
in 
the 
floor 
of 
the 
aviary. 
So 
I 
have 
made 
a 
platform 
of 
a 
princely 
garden, 
partly 
by 
precept, 
partly 
by 
drawing, 
not 
a 
model, 
but 
some 
general 
lines 
of 
it; 
and 
in 
this 
I 
have 
spared 
for 
no 
cost. 
But 
it 
is 
nothing 
for 
great 
princes, 
that 
for 
the 
most 
part 
taking 
advice 
with 
workmen, 
with 
no 
less 
cost 
set 
their 
things 
together; 
and 
sometimes 
add 
statuas 
and 
such 
things 
for 
state 
and 
magnificence, 
but 
nothing 
to 
the 
true 
pleasure 
of 
a 
garden. 



OF 
NEGOTIATING 


It 
is 
generally 
better 
to 
deal 
by 
speech 
than 
by 
letter; 
and 
by 
the 
mediation 
of 
a 
third 
than 
by 
a 
man’s 
self. 
Letters 
are 
good, 
when 
a 
man 
would 
draw 
an 
answer 
by 
letter 
back 
again; 
or 
when 
it 
may 
serve 
for 
a 
man’s 
justification 
afterwards 
to 
produce 
his 
own 
letter; 
or 
where 
it 
may 
be 
danger 
to 
be 
interrupted, 
or 
heard 
by 
pieces. 
To 
deal 
in 
person 
is 
good, 
when 
a 
man’s 
face 
breedeth 
regard, 
as 
commonly 
with 
inferiors; 
or 
in 
tender 
cases, 
where 
a 
man’s 
eye, 
upon 
the 
countenance 
of 
him 
with 
whom 
he 
speaketh, 
may 
give 
him 
a 
direction 
how 
far 
to 
go; 
and 
generally, 
where 
a 
man 
will 
reserve 
to 
himself 
liberty, 
either 
to 
disavow 
or 
to 
expound. 
In 
choice 
of 
instruments, 
it 
is 
better 
to 
choose 
men 
of 
a 
plainer 
sort, 
that 
are 
like 
to 
do 
that, 
that 
is 
committed 
to 
them, 
and 
to 
report 
back 
again 
faithfully 
the 
success, 
than 
those 
that 
are 
cunning, 
to 
contrive, 
out 
of 
other 
men’s 
business, 
somewhat 
to 
grace 
themselves, 
and 
will 
help 
the 
matter 
in 
report 
for 
satisfaction’s 
sake. 
Use 
also 
such 
persons 
as 
affect 
the 
business, 
wherein 
they 
are 
employed; 
for 
that 
quickeneth 
much; 
and 
such, 
as 
are 
fit 
for 
the 
matter; 
as 
bold 
men 
for 
expostulation, 
fair-spoken 
men 
for 
persuasion, 
crafty 
for 
inquiry 
and 
observation, 
froward, 
and 
absurd 
men, 
for 
business 
that 
doth 
not 
well 
bear 
out 
itself. 
Use 
also 
such 
as 
have 
been 
lucky, 
and 
prevailed 
before, 
in 
things 
wherein 
you 
have 
employed 
them; 
for 
that 
breeds 
confidence, 
and 
they 
will 
strive 
to 
maintain 
their 
prescription. 
It 
is 
better 
to 
sound 
a 
person, 
with 
whom 
one 
deals 
afar 
off 
than 
to 
fall 
upon 
the 
point 
at 
first; 
except 
you 
mean 
to 
surprise 
him 
by 
some 
short 
question. 
It 
is 
better 
dealing 
with 
men 
in 
appetite, 
than 
with 
those 
that 
are 
where 
they 
would 
be. 
If 
a 
man 
deal 
with 
another 
upon 
conditions, 
the 
start 
or 
first 
performance 
is 
all; 
which 
a 
man 
cannot 
reasonably 
demand, 
except 
either 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
thing 
be 
such, 
which 
must 
go 
before; 
or 
else 
a 
man 
can 
persuade 
the 
other 
party, 
that 
he 
shall 
still 
need 
him 
in 
some 
other 
thing; 
or 
else 
that 
he 
be 
counted 
the 
honester 
man. 
All 
practice 
is 
to 
discover, 
or 
to 
work. 
Men 
discover 
themselves 
in 
trust, 
in 
passion, 
at 
unawares, 
and 
of 
necessity, 
when 
they 
would 
have 
somewhat 
done, 
and 
cannot 
find 
an 
apt 
pretext. 
If 
you 
would 
work 
any 
man, 
you 
must 
either 
know 
his 
nature 
and 
fashions, 
and 
so 
lead 
him; 
or 
his 
ends, 
and 
so 
persuade 
him 
or 
his 
weakness 
and 
disadvantages, 
and 
so 
awe 
him 
or 
those 



that 
have 
interest 
in 
him, 
and 
so 
govern 
him. 
In 
dealing 
with 
cunning 
persons, 
we 
must 
ever 
consider 
their 
ends, 
to 
interpret 
their 
speeches; 
and 
it 
is 
good 
to 
say 
little 
to 
them, 
and 
that 
which 
they 
least 
look 
for. 
In 
all 
negotiations 
of 
difficulty, 
a 
man 
may 
not 
look 
to 
sow 
and 
reap 
at 
once; 
but 
must 
prepare 
business, 
and 
so 
ripen 
it 
by 
degrees. 



OF 
FOLLOWERS 
AND 
FRIENDS 


Costly 
followers 
are 
not 
to 
be 
liked; 
lest 
while 
a 
man 
maketh 
his 
train 
longer, 
he 
make 
his 
wings 
shorter. 
I 
reckon 
to 
be 
costly, 
not 
them 
alone 
which 
charge 
the 
purse, 
but 
which 
are 
wearisome, 
and 
importune 
in 
suits. 
Ordinary 
followers 
ought 
to 
challenge 
no 
higher 
conditions, 
than 
countenance, 
recommendation, 
and 
protection 
from 
wrongs. 
Factious 
followers 
are 
worse 
to 
be 
liked, 
which 
follow 
not 
upon 
affection 
to 
him, 
with 
whom 
they 
range 
themselves, 
but 
upon 
discontentment 
conceived 
against 
some 
other; 
whereupon 
commonly 
ensueth 
that 
ill 
intelligence, 
that 
we 
many 
times 
see 
between 
great 
personages. 
Likewise 
glorious 
followers, 
who 
make 
themselves 
as 
trumpets 
of 
the 
commendation 
of 
those 
they 
follow, 
are 
full 
of 
inconvenience; 
for 
they 
taint 
business 
through 
want 
of 
secrecy; 
and 
they 
export 
honor 
from 
a 
man, 
and 
make 
him 
a 
return 
in 
envy. 
There 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
followers 
likewise, 
which 
are 
dangerous, 
being 
indeed 
espials; 
which 
inquire 
the 
secrets 
of 
the 
house, 
and 
bear 
tales 
of 
them, 
to 
others. 
Yet 
such 
men, 
many 
times, 
are 
in 
great 
favor; 
for 
they 
are 
officious, 
and 
commonly 
exchange 
tales. 
The 
following 
by 
certain 
estates 
of 
men, 
answerable 
to 
that, 
which 
a 
great 
person 
himself 
professeth 
(as 
of 
soldiers, 
to 
him 
that 
hath 
been 
employed 
in 
the 
wars, 
and 
the 
like), 
hath 
ever 
been 
a 
thing 
civil, 
and 
well 
taken, 
even 
in 
monarchies; 
so 
it 
be 
without 
too 
much 
pomp 
or 
popularity. 
But 
the 
most 
honorable 
kind 
of 
following, 
is 
to 
be 
followed 
as 
one, 
that 
apprehendeth 
to 
advance 
virtue, 
and 
desert, 
in 
all 
sorts 
of 
persons. 
And 
yet, 
where 
there 
is 
no 
eminent 
odds 
in 
sufficiency, 
it 
is 
better 
to 
take 
with 
the 
more 
passable, 
than 
with 
the 
more 
able. 
And 
besides, 
to 
speak 
truth, 
in 
base 
times, 
active 
men 
are 
of 
more 
use 
than 
virtuous. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
in 
government, 
it 
is 
good 
to 
use 
men 
of 
one 
rank 
equally: 
for 
to 
countenance 
some 
extraordinarily, 
is 
to 
make 
them 
insolent, 
and 
the 
rest 
discontent; 
because 
they 
may 
claim 
a 
due. 
But 
contrariwise, 
in 
favor, 
to 
use 
men 
with 
much 
difference 
and 
election 
is 
good; 
for 
it 
maketh 
the 
persons 
preferred 
more 
thankful, 
and 
the 
rest 
more 
officious: 
because 
all 
is 
of 
favor. 
It 
is 
good 
discretion, 
not 
to 
make 
too 
much 
of 
any 
man 
at 
the 
first; 
because 
one 
cannot 
hold 
out 
that 
proportion. 
To 
be 
governed 
(as 
we 
call 
it) 
by 
one 
is 
not 
safe; 
for 
it 
shows 
softness, 
and 
gives 
a 
freedom, 
to 
scandal 
and 
disreputation; 
for 



those, 
that 
would 
not 
censure 
or 
speak 
in 
of 
a 
man 
immediately, 
will 
talk 
more 
boldly 
of 
those 
that 
are 
so 
great 
with 
them, 
and 
thereby 
wound 
their 
honor. 
Yet 
to 
be 
distracted 
with 
many 
is 
worse; 
for 
it 
makes 
men 
to 
be 
of 
the 
last 
impression, 
and 
fun 
of 
change. 
To 
take 
advice 
of 
some 
few 
friends, 
is 
ever 
honorable; 
for 
lookers-on 
many 
times 
see 
more 
than 
gamesters; 
and 
the 
vale 
best 
discovereth 
the 
hill. 
There 
is 
little 
friendship 
in 
the 
world, 
and 
least 
of 
all 
between 
equals, 
which 
was 
wont 
to 
be 
magnified. 
That 
that 
is, 
is 
between 
superior 
and 
inferior, 
whose 
fortunes 
may 
comprehend 
the 
one 
the 
other. 



OF 
SUITORS 


Many 
ill 
matters 
and 
projects 
are 
undertaken; 
and 
private 
suits 
do 
putrefy 
the 
public 
good. 
Many 
good 
matters, 
are 
undertaken 
with 
bad 
minds; 
I 
mean 
not 
only 
corrupt 
minds, 
but 
crafty 
minds, 
that 
intend 
not 
performance. 
Some 
embrace 
suits, 
which 
never 
mean 
to 
deal 
effectually 
in 
them; 
but 
if 
they 
see 
there 
may 
be 
life 
in 
the 
matter, 
by 
some 
other 
mean, 
they 
will 
be 
content 
to 
win 
a 
thank, 
or 
take 
a 
second 
reward, 
or 
at 
least 
to 
make 
use, 
in 
the 
meantime, 
of 
the 
suitor’s 
hopes. 
Some 
take 
hold 
of 
suits, 
only 
for 
an 
occasion 
to 
cross 
some 
other; 
or 
to 
make 
an 
information, 
whereof 
they 
could 
not 
otherwise 
have 
apt 
pretext; 
without 
care 
what 
become 
of 
the 
suit, 
when 
that 
turn 
is 
served; 
or, 
generally, 
to 
make 
other 
men’s 
business 
a 
kind 
of 
entertainment, 
to 
bring 
in 
their 
own. 
Nay, 
some 
undertake 
suits, 
with 
a 
full 
purpose 
to 
let 
them 
fall; 
to 
the 
end 
to 
gratify 
the 
adverse 
party, 
or 
competitor. 
Surely 
there 
is 
in 
some 
sort 
a 
right 
in 
every 
suit; 
either 
a 
right 
of 
equity, 
if 
it 
be 
a 
suit 
of 
controversy; 
or 
a 
right 
of 
desert, 
if 
it 
be 
a 
suit 
of 
petition. 
If 
affection 
lead 
a 
man 
to 
favor 
the 
wrong 
side 
in 
justice, 
let 
him 
rather 
use 
his 
countenance 
to 
compound 
the 
matter, 
than 
to 
carry 
it. 
If 
affection 
lead 
a 
man 
to 
favor 
the 
less 
worthy 
in 
desert, 
let 
him 
do 
it, 
without 
depraving 
or 
disabling 
the 
better 
deserver. 
In 
suits 
which 
a 
man 
doth 
not 
well 
understand, 
it 
is 
good 
to 
refer 
them 
to 
some 
friend 
of 
trust 
and 
judgment, 
that 
may 
report, 
whether 
he 
may 
deal 
in 
them 
with 
honor: 
but 
let 
him 
choose 
well 
his 
referendaries, 
for 
else 
he 
may 
be 
led 
by 
the 
nose. 
Suitors 
are 
so 
distasted 
with 
delays 
and 
abuses, 
that 
plain 
dealing, 
in 
denying 
to 
deal 
in 
suits 
at 
first, 
and 
reporting 
the 
success 
barely, 
and 
in 
challenging 
no 
more 
thanks 
than 
one 
hath 
deserved, 
is 
grown 
not 
only 
honorable, 
but 
also 
gracious. 
In 
suits 
of 
favor, 
the 
first 
coming 
ought 
to 
take 
little 
place: 
so 
far 
forth, 
consideration 
may 
be 
had 
of 
his 
trust, 
that 
if 
intelligence 
of 
the 
matter 
could 
not 
otherwise 
have 
been 
had, 
but 
by 
him, 
advantage 
be 
not 
taken 
of 
the 
note, 
but 
the 
party 
left 
to 
his 
other 
means; 
and 
in 
some 
sort 
recompensed, 
for 
his 
discovery. 
To 
be 
ignorant 
of 
the 
value 
of 
a 
suit, 
is 
simplicity; 
as 
well 
as 
to 
be 
ignorant 
of 
the 
right 
thereof, 
is 
want 
of 
conscience. 
Secrecy 
in 
suits, 
is 
a 
great 
mean 
of 
obtaining; 
for 
voicing 
them 
to 
be 
in 
forwardness, 
may 
discourage 
some 
kind 
of 
suitors, 
but 
doth 
quicken 
and 
awake 
others. 
But 
timing 
of 
the 
suit 
is 
the 
principal. 



Timing, 
I 
say, 
not 
only 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
person 
that 
should 
grant 
it, 
but 
in 
respect 
of 
those, 
which 
are 
like 
to 
cross 
it. 
Let 
a 
man, 
in 
the 
choice 
of 
his 
mean, 
rather 
choose 
the 
fittest 
mean, 
than 
the 
greatest 
mean; 
and 
rather 
them 
that 
deal 
in 
certain 
things, 
than 
those 
that 
are 
general. 
The 
reparation 
of 
a 
denial, 
is 
sometimes 
equal 
to 
the 
first 
grant; 
if 
a 
man 
show 
himself 
neither 
dejected 
nor 
discontented. 
Iniquum 
petas 
ut 
aequum 
feras 
is 
a 
good 
rule, 
where 
a 
man 
hath 
strength 
of 
favor: 
but 
otherwise, 
a 
man 
were 
better 
rise 
in 
his 
suit; 
for 
he, 
that 
would 
have 
ventured 
at 
first 
to 
have 
lost 
the 
suitor, 
will 
not 
in 
the 
conclusion 
lose 
both 
the 
suitor, 
and 
his 
own 
former 
favor. 
Nothing 
is 
thought 
so 
easy 
a 
request 
to 
a 
great 
person, 
as 
his 
letter; 
and 
yet, 
if 
it 
be 
not 
in 
a 
good 
cause, 
it 
is 
so 
much 
out 
of 
his 
reputation. 
There 
are 
no 
worse 
instruments, 
than 
these 
general 
contrivers 
of 
suits; 
for 
they 
are 
but 
a 
kind 
of 
poison, 
and 
infection, 
to 
public 
proceedings. 



F 
STUDIES 


Studies 
serve 
for 
delight, 
for 
ornament, 
and 
for 
ability. 
Their 
chief 
use 
for 
delight, 
is 
in 
privateness 
and 
retiring; 
for 
ornament, 
is 
in 
discourse; 
and 
for 
ability, 
is 
in 
the 
judgment, 
and 
disposition 
of 
business. 
For 
expert 
men 
can 
execute, 
and 
perhaps 
judge 
of 
particulars, 
one 
by 
one; 
but 
the 
general 
counsels, 
and 
the 
plots 
and 
marshalling 
of 
affairs, 
come 
best, 
from 
those 
that 
are 
learned. 
To 
spend 
too 
much 
time 
in 
studies 
is 
sloth; 
to 
use 
them 
too 
much 
for 
ornament, 
is 
affectation; 
to 
make 
judgment 
wholly 
by 
their 
rules, 
is 
the 
humor 
of 
a 
scholar. 
They 
perfect 
nature, 
and 
are 
perfected 
by 
experience: 
for 
natural 
abilities 
are 
like 
natural 
plants, 
that 
need 
proyning, 
by 
study; 
and 
studies 
themselves, 
do 
give 
forth 
directions 
too 
much 
at 
large, 
except 
they 
be 
bounded 
in 
by 
experience. 
Crafty 
men 
contemn 
studies, 
simple 
men 
admire 
them, 
and 
wise 
men 
use 
them; 
for 
they 
teach 
not 
their 
own 
use; 
but 
that 
is 
a 
wisdom 
without 
them, 
and 
above 
them, 
won 
by 
observation. 
Read 
not 
to 
contradict 
and 
confute; 
nor 
to 
believe 
and 
take 
for 
granted; 
nor 
to 
find 
talk 
and 
discourse; 
but 
to 
weigh 
and 
consider. 
Some 
books 
are 
to 
be 
tasted, 
others 
to 
be 
swallowed, 
and 
some 
few 
to 
be 
chewed 
and 
digested; 
that 
is, 
some 
books 
are 
to 
be 
read 
only 
in 
parts; 
others 
to 
be 
read, 
but 
not 
curiously; 
and 
some 
few 
to 
be 
read 
wholly, 
and 
with 
diligence 
and 
attention. 
Some 
books 
also 
may 
be 
read 
by 
deputy, 
and 
extracts 
made 
of 
them 
by 
others; 
but 
that 
would 
be 
only 
in 
the 
less 
important 
arguments, 
and 
the 
meaner 
sort 
of 
books, 
else 
distilled 
books 
are 
like 
common 
distilled 
waters, 
flashy 
things. 
Reading 
maketh 
a 
full 
man; 
conference 
a 
ready 
man; 
and 
writing 
an 
exact 
man. 
And 
therefore, 
if 
a 
man 
write 
little, 
he 
had 
need 
have 
a 
great 
memory; 
if 
he 
confer 
little, 
he 
had 
need 
have 
a 
present 
wit: 
and 
if 
he 
read 
little, 
he 
had 
need 
have 
much 
cunning, 
to 
seem 
to 
know, 
that 
he 
doth 
not. 
Histories 
make 
men 
wise; 
poets 
witty; 
the 
mathematics 
subtile; 
natural 
philosophy 
deep; 
moral 
grave; 
logic 
and 
rhetoric 
able 
to 
contend. 
Abeunt 
studia 
in 
mores. 
Nay, 
there 
is 
no 
stond 
or 
impediment 
in 
the 
wit, 
but 
may 
be 
wrought 
out 
by 
fit 
studies; 
like 
as 
diseases 
of 
the 
body, 
may 
have 
appropriate 
exercises. 
Bowling 
is 
good 
for 
the 
stone 
and 
reins; 
shooting 
for 
the 
lungs 
and 
breast; 
gentle 
walking 
for 
the 
stomach; 
riding 
for 
the 
head; 
and 
the 
like. 
So 
if 
a 
man’s 
wit 
be 
wandering, 
let 
him 
study 
the 
mathematics; 
for 
in 
demonstrations, 
if 
his 
wit 
be 
called 
away 
never 
so 
little, 
he 
must 
begin 
again. 



If 
his 
wit 
be 
not 
apt 
to 
distinguish 
or 
find 
differences, 
let 
him 
study 
the 
Schoolmen; 
for 
they 
are 
cymini 
sectores. 
If 
he 
be 
not 
apt 
to 
beat 
over 
matters, 
and 
to 
call 
up 
one 
thing 
to 
prove 
and 
illustrate 
another, 
let 
him 
study 
the 
lawyers’ 
cases. 
So 
every 
defect 
of 
the 
mind, 
may 
have 
a 
special 
receipt. 



OF 
FACTION 


Many 
have 
an 
opinion 
not 
wise, 
that 
for 
a 
prince 
to 
govern 
his 
estate, 
or 
for 
a 
great 
person 
to 
govern 
his 
proceedings, 
according 
to 
the 
respect 
of 
factions, 
is 
a 
principal 
part 
of 
policy; 
whereas 
contrariwise, 
the 
chiefest 
wisdom, 
is 
either 
in 
ordering 
those 
things 
which 
are 
general, 
and 
wherein 
men 
of 
several 
factions 
do 
nevertheless 
agree; 
or 
in 
dealing 
with 
correspondence 
to 
particular 
persons, 
one 
by 
one. 
But 
I 
say 
not 
that 
the 
considerations 
of 
factions, 
is 
to 
be 
neglected. 
Mean 
men, 
in 
their 
rising, 
must 
adhere; 
but 
great 
men, 
that 
have 
strength 
in 
themselves, 
were 
better 
to 
maintain 
themselves 
indifferent, 
and 
neutral. 
Yet 
even 
in 
beginners, 
to 
adhere 
so 
moderately, 
as 
he 
be 
a 
man 
of 
the 
one 
faction, 
which 
is 
most 
passable 
with 
the 
other, 
commonly 
giveth 
best 
way. 
The 
lower 
and 
weaker 
faction, 
is 
the 
firmer 
in 
conjunction; 
and 
it 
is 
often 
seen, 
that 
a 
few 
that 
are 
stiff, 
do 
tire 
out 
a 
greater 
number, 
that 
are 
more 
moderate. 
When 
one 
of 
the 
factions 
is 
extinguished, 
the 
remaining 
subdivideth; 
as 
the 
faction 
between 
Lucullus, 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
nobles 
of 
the 
senate 
(which 
they 
called 
Optimates) 
held 
out 
awhile, 
against 
the 
faction 
of 
Pompey 
and 
Caesar; 
but 
when 
the 
senate’s 
authority 
was 
pulled 
down, 
Caesar 
and 
Pompey 
soon 
after 
brake. 
The 
faction 
or 
party 
of 
Antonius 
and 
Octavianus 
Caesar, 
against 
Brutus 
and 
Cassius, 
held 
out 
likewise 
for 
a 
time; 
but 
when 
Brutus 
and 
Cassius 
were 
overthrown, 
then 
soon 
after, 
Antonius 
and 
Octavianus 
brake 
and 
subdivided. 
These 
examples 
are 
of 
wars, 
but 
the 
same 
holdeth 
in 
private 
factions. 
And 
therefore, 
those 
that 
are 
seconds 
in 
factions, 
do 
many 
times, 
when 
the 
faction 
subdivideth, 
prove 
principals; 
but 
many 
times 
also, 
they 
prove 
ciphers 
and 
cashiered; 
for 
many 
a 
man’s 
strength 
is 
in 
opposition; 
and 
when 
that 
faileth, 
he 
groweth 
out 
of 
use. 
It 
is 
commonly 
seen, 
that 
men, 
once 
placed, 
take 
in 
with 
the 
contrary 
faction, 
to 
that 
by 
which 
they 
enter: 
thinking 
belike, 
that 
they 
have 
the 
first 
sure, 
and 
now 
are 
ready 
for 
a 
new 
purchase. 
The 
traitor 
in 
faction, 
lightly 
goeth 
away 
with 
it; 
for 
when 
matters 
have 
stuck 
long 
in 
balancing, 
the 
winning 
of 
some 
one 
man 
casteth 
them, 
and 
he 
getteth 
all 
the 
thanks. 
The 
even 
carriage 
between 
two 
factions, 
proceedeth 
not 
always 
of 
moderation, 
but 
of 
a 
trueness 
to 
a 
man’s 
self, 
with 
end 
to 
make 
use 
of 
both. 
Certainly 
in 
Italy, 
they 
hold 
it 
a 
little 
suspect 
in 
popes, 
when 
they 
have 
often 
in 
their 
mouth 
Padre 
commune: 



and 
take 
it 
to 
be 
a 
sign 
of 
one, 
that 
meaneth 
to 
refer 
all 
to 
the 
greatness 
of 
his 
own 
house. 
Kings 
had 
need 
beware, 
how 
they 
side 
themselves, 
and 
make 
themselves 
as 
of 
a 
faction 
or 
party; 
for 
leagues 
within 
the 
state, 
are 
ever 
pernicious 
to 
monarchies: 
for 
they 
raise 
an 
obligation, 
paramount 
to 
obligation 
of 
sovereignty, 
and 
make 
the 
king 
tanquam 
unus 
ex 
nobis; 
as 
was 
to 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
League 
of 
France. 
When 
factions 
are 
canied 
too 
high 
and 
too 
violently, 
it 
is 
a 
sign 
of 
weakness 
in 
princes; 
and 
much 
to 
the 
prejudice, 
both 
of 
their 
authority 
and 
business. 
The 
motions 
of 
factions 
under 
kings 
ought 
to 
be, 
like 
the 
motions 
(as 
the 
astronomers 
speak) 
of 
the 
inferior 
orbs, 
which 
may 
have 
their 
proper 
motions, 
but 
yet 
still 
are 
quietly 
carried, 
by 
the 
higher 
motion 
of 
primum 
mobile. 



OF 
CEREMONIES 
AND 
RESPECT 


He 
that 
is 
only 
real, 
had 
need 
have 
exceeding 
great 
parts 
of 
virtue; 
as 
the 
stone 
had 
need 
to 
be 
rich, 
that 
is 
set 
without 
foil. 
But 
if 
a 
man 
mark 
it 
well, 
it 
is, 
in 
praise 
and 
commendation 
of 
men, 
as 
it 
is 
in 
gettings 
and 
gains: 
for 
the 
proverb 
is 
true, 
That 
light 
gains 
make 
heavy 
purses; 
for 
light 
gains 
come 
thick, 
whereas 
great, 
come 
but 
now 
and 
then. 
So 
it 
is 
true, 
that 
small 
matters 
win 
great 
commendation, 
because 
they 
are 
continually 
in 
use 
and 
in 
note: 
whereas 
the 
occasion 
of 
any 
great 
virtue, 
cometh 
but 
on 
festivals. 
Therefore 
it 
doth 
much 
add 
to 
a 
man’s 
reputation, 
and 
is 
(as 
Queen 
Isabella 
said) 
like 
perpetual 
letters 
commendatory, 
to 
have 
good 
forms. 
To 
attain 
them, 
it 
almost 
sufficeth 
not 
to 
despise 
them; 
for 
so 
shall 
a 
man 
observe 
them 
in 
others; 
and 
let 
him 
trust 
himself 
with 
the 
rest. 
For 
if 
he 
labor 
too 
much 
to 
express 
them, 
he 
shall 
lose 
their 
grace; 
which 
is 
to 
be 
natural 
and 
unaffected. 
Some 
men’s 
behavior 
is 
like 
a 
verse, 
wherein 
every 
syllable 
is 
measured; 
how 
can 
a 
man 
comprehend 
great 
matters, 
that 
breaketh 
his 
mind 
too 
much, 
to 
small 
observations? 
Not 
to 
use 
ceremonies 
at 
all, 
is 
to 
teach 
others 
not 
to 
use 
them 
again; 
and 
so 
diminisheth 
respect 
to 
himself; 
especially 
they 
be 
not 
to 
be 
omitted, 
to 
strangers 
and 
formal 
natures; 
but 
the 
dwelling 
upon 
them, 
and 
exalting 
them 
above 
the 
moon, 
is 
not 
only 
tedious, 
but 
doth 
diminish 
the 
faith 
and 
credit 
of 
him 
that 
speaks. 
And 
certainly, 
there 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
conveying, 
of 
effectual 
and 
imprinting 
passages 
amongst 
compliments, 
which 
is 
of 
singular 
use, 
if 
a 
man 
can 
hit 
upon 
it. 
Amongst 
a 
man’s 
peers, 
a 
man 
shall 
be 
sure 
of 
familiarity; 
and 
therefore 
it 
is 
good, 
a 
little 
to 
keep 
state. 
Amongst 
a 
man’s 
inferiors 
one 
shall 
be 
sure 
of 
reverence; 
and 
therefore 
it 
is 
good, 
a 
little 
to 
be 
familiar. 
He 
that 
is 
too 
much 
in 
anything, 
so 
that 
he 
giveth 
another 
occasion 
of 
satiety, 
maketh 
himself 
cheap. 
To 
apply 
one’s 
self 
to 
others, 
is 
good; 
so 
it 
be 
with 
demonstration, 
that 
a 
man 
doth 
it 
upon 
regard, 
and 
not 
upon 
facility. 
It 
is 
a 
good 
precept 
generally, 
in 
seconding 
another, 
yet 
to 
add 
somewhat 
of 
one’s 
own: 
as 
if 
you 
will 
grant 
his 
opinion, 
let 
it 
be 
with 
some 
distinction; 
if 
you 
will 
follow 
his 
motion, 
let 
it 
be 
with 
condition; 
if 
you 
allow 
his 
counsel 
let 
it 
be 
with 
alleging 
further 
reason. 
Men 
had 
need 
beware, 
how 
they 
be 
too 
perfect 
in 
compliments; 
for 
be 
they 
never 
so 
sufficient 
otherwise, 
their 
enviers 
will 
be 
sure 
to 
give 
them 
that 
attribute, 
to 
the 
disadvantage 
of 
their 
greater 
virtues. 
It 
is 
loss 
also 
in 
business, 
to 
be 
too 
full 



of 
respects, 
or 
to 
be 
curious, 
in 
observing 
times 
and 
opportunities. 
Solomon 
saith, 
He 
that 
considereth 
the 
wind, 
shall 
not 
sow, 
and 
he 
that 
looketh 
to 
the 
clouds, 
shall 
not 
reap. 
A 
wise 
man 
will 
make 
more 
opportunities, 
than 
he 
finds. 
Men’s 
behavior 
should 
be, 
like 
their 
apparel, 
not 
too 
strait 
or 
point 
device, 
but 
free 
for 
exercise 
or 
motion. 



OF 
PRAISE 


Praise 
is 
the 
reflection 
of 
virtue; 
but 
it 
is 
as 
the 
glass 
or 
body, 
which 
giveth 
the 
reflection. 
If 
it 
be 
from 
the 
common 
people, 
it 
is 
commonly 
false 
and 
naught; 
and 
rather 
followeth 
vain 
persons, 
than 
virtuous. 
For 
the 
common 
people 
understand 
not 
many 
excellent 
virtues. 
The 
lowest 
virtues 
draw 
praise 
from 
them; 
the 
middle 
virtues 
work 
in 
them 
astonishment 
or 
admiration; 
but 
of 
the 
highest 
virtues, 
they 
have 
no 
sense 
of 
perceiving 
at 
an. 
But 
shows, 
and 
species 
virtutibus 
similes, 
serve 
best 
with 
them. 
Certainly 
fame 
is 
like 
a 
river, 
that 
beareth 
up 
things 
light 
and 
swoln, 
and 
drowns 
things 
weighty 
and 
solid. 
But 
if 
persons 
of 
quality 
and 
judgment 
concur, 
then 
it 
is 
(as 
the 
Scripture 
saith) 
nomen 
bonum 
instar 
unguenti 
fragrantis. 
It 
filleth 
all 
round 
about, 
and 
will 
not 
easily 
away. 
For 
the 
odors 
of 
ointments 
are 
more 
durable, 
than 
those 
of 
flowers. 
There 
be 
so 
many 
false 
points 
of 
praise, 
that 
a 
man 
may 
justly 
hold 
it 
a 
suspect. 
Some 
praises 
proceed 
merely 
of 
flattery; 
and 
if 
he 
be 
an 
ordinary 
flatterer, 
he 
will 
have 
certain 
common 
attributes, 
which 
may 
serve 
every 
man; 
if 
he 
be 
a 
cunning 
flatterer, 
he 
will 
follow 
the 
archflatterer, 
which 
is 
a 
man’s 
self; 
and 
wherein 
a 
man 
thinketh 
best 
of 
himself, 
therein 
the 
flatterer 
will 
uphold 
him 
most: 
but 
if 
he 
be 
an 
impudent 
flatterer, 
look 
wherein 
a 
man 
is 
conscious 
to 
himself, 
that 
he 
is 
most 
defective, 
and 
is 
most 
out 
of 
countenance 
in 
himself, 
that 
will 
the 
flatterer 
entitle 
him 
to 
perforce, 
spreta 
conscientia. 
Some 
praises 
come 
of 
good 
wishes 
and 
respects, 
which 
is 
a 
form 
due, 
in 
civility, 
to 
kings 
and 
great 
persons, 
laudando 
praecipere, 
when 
by 
telling 
men 
what 
they 
are, 
they 
represent 
to 
them, 
what 
they 
should 
be. 
Some 
men 
are 
praised 
maliciously, 
to 
their 
hurt, 
thereby 
to 
stir 
envy 
and 
jealousy 
towards 
them: 
pessimum 
genus 
inimicorum 
laudantium; 
insomuch 
as 
it 
was 
a 
proverb, 
amongst 
the 
Grecians, 
that 
he 
that 
was 
praised 
to 
his 
hurt, 
should 
have 
a 
push 
rise 
upon 
his 
nose; 
as 
we 
say, 
that 
a 
blister 
will 
rise 
upon 
one’s 
tongue, 
that 
tells 
a 
lie. 
Certainly 
moderate 
praise, 
used 
with 
opportunity, 
and 
not 
vulgar, 
is 
that 
which 
doth 
the 
good. 
Solomon 
saith, 
He 
that 
praiseth 
his 
friend 
aloud, 
rising 
early, 
it 
shall 
be 
to 
him 
no 
better 
than 
a 
curse. 
Too 
much 
magnifying 
of 
man 
or 
matter, 
doth 
irritate 
contradiction, 
and 
procure 
envy 
and 
scorn. 
To 
praise 
a 
man’s 
self, 
cannot 
be 
decent, 
except 
it 
be 
in 
rare 
cases; 
but 
to 
praise 
a 
man’s 
office 
or 
profession, 
he 
may 
do 
it 
with 



good 
grace, 
and 
with 
a 
kind 
of 
magnanimity. 
The 
cardinals 
of 
Rome, 
which 
are 
theologues, 
and 
friars, 
and 
Schoolmen, 
have 
a 
phrase 
of 
notable 
contempt 
and 
scorn 
towards 
civil 
business: 
for 
they 
call 
all 
temporal 
business 
of 
wars, 
embassages, 
judicature, 
and 
other 
employments, 
sbirrerie, 
which 
is 
undersheriffries; 
as 
if 
they 
were 
but 
matters, 
for 
under-sheriffs 
and 
catchpoles: 
though 
many 
times 
those 
under-sheriffries 
do 
more 
good, 
than 
their 
high 
speculations. 
St. 
Paul, 
when 
he 
boasts 
of 
himself, 
he 
doth 
oft 
interlace, 
I 
speak 
like 
a 
fool; 
but 
speaking 
of 
his 
calling, 
he 
saith, 
magnificabo 
apostolatum 
meum. 



F 
VAIN–GLORY 


It 
was 
prettily 
devised 
of 
AEsop, 
The 
fly 
sat 
upon 
the 
axle-tree 
of 
the 
chariot 
wheel, 
and 
said, 
What 
a 
dust 
do 
I 
raise! 
So 
are 
there 
some 
vain 
persons, 
that 
whatsoever 
goeth 
alone, 
or 
moveth 
upon 
greater 
means, 
if 
they 
have 
never 
so 
little 
hand 
in 
it, 
they 
think 
it 
is 
they 
that 
carry 
it. 
They 
that 
are 
glorious, 
must 
needs 
be 
factious; 
for 
an 
bravery 
stands 
upon 
comparisons. 
They 
must 
needs 
be 
violent, 
to 
make 
good 
their 
own 
vaunts. 
Neither 
can 
they 
be 
secret, 
and 
therefore 
not 
effectual; 
but 
according 
to 
the 
French 
proverb, 
Beaucoup 
de 
bruit, 
peu 
de 
fruit; 
Much 
bruit 
little 
fruit. 
Yet 
certainly, 
there 
is 
use 
of 
this 
quality 
in 
civil 
affairs. 
Where 
there 
is 
an 
opinion 
and 
fame 
to 
be 
created, 
either 
of 
virtue 
or 
greatness, 
these 
men 
are 
good 
trumpeters. 
Again, 
as 
Titus 
Livius 
noteth, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Antiochus 
and 
the 
AEtolians, 
There 
are 
sometimes 
great 
effects, 
of 
cross 
lies; 
as 
if 
a 
man, 
that 
negotiates 
between 
two 
princes, 
to 
draw 
them 
to 
join 
in 
a 
war 
against 
the 
third, 
doth 
extol 
the 
forces 
of 
either 
of 
them, 
above 
measure, 
the 
one 
to 
the 
other: 
and 
sometimes 
he 
that 
deals 
between 
man 
and 
man, 
raiseth 
his 
own 
credit 
with 
both, 
by 
pretending 
greater 
interest 
than 
he 
hath 
in 
either. 
And 
in 
these 
and 
the 
like 
kinds, 
it 
often 
falls 
out, 
that 
somewhat 
is 
produced 
of 
nothing; 
for 
lies 
are 
sufficient 
to 
breed 
opinion, 
and 
opinion 
brings 
on 
substance. 
In 
militar 
commanders 
and 
soldiers, 
vain-glory 
is 
an 
essential 
point; 
for 
as 
iron 
sharpens 
iron, 
so 
by 
glory, 
one 
courage 
sharpeneth 
another. 
In 
cases 
of 
great 
enterprise 
upon 
charge 
and 
adventure, 
a 
composition 
of 
glorious 
natures, 
doth 
put 
life 
into 
business; 
and 
those 
that 
are 
of 
solid 
and 
sober 
natures, 
have 
more 
of 
the 
ballast, 
than 
of 
the 
sail. 
In 
fame 
of 
leaming, 
the 
flight 
will 
be 
slow 
without 
some 
feathers 
of 
ostentation. 
Qui 
de 
contemnenda 
gloria 
libros 
scribunt, 
nomen, 
suuminscribunt. 
Socrates, 
Aristotle, 
Galen, 
were 
men 
full 
of 
ostentation. 
Certainly 
vain-glory 
helpeth 
to 
perpetuate 
a 
man’s 
memory; 
and 
virtue 
was 
never 
so 
beholding 
to 
human 
nature, 
as 
it 
received 
his 
due 
at 
the 
second 
hand. 
Neither 
had 
the 
fame 
of 
Cicero, 
Seneca, 
Plinius 
Secundus, 
borne 
her 
age 
so 
well, 
if 
it 
had 
not 
been 
joined 
with 
some 
vanity 
in 
themselves; 
like 
unto 
varnish, 
that 
makes 
ceilings 
not 
only 
shine 
but 
last. 
But 
all 
this 
while, 
when 
I 
speak 
of 
vain-glory, 
I 
mean 
not 
of 
that 
property, 
that 
Tacitus 
doth 
attribute 
to 
Mucianus; 
Omnium 
quae 
dixerat 
feceratque 
arte 
quadam 
ostentator: 
for 
that 
proceeds 
not 
of 
vanity, 
but 
of 
natural 



magnanimity 
and 
discretion; 
and 
in 
some 
persons, 
is 
not 
only 
comely, 
but 
gracious. 
For 
excusations, 
cessions, 
modesty 
itself 
well 
governed, 
are 
but 
arts 
of 
ostentation. 
And 
amongst 
those 
arts, 
there 
is 
none 
better 
than 
that 
which 
Plinius 
Secundus 
speaketh 
of, 
which 
is 
to 
be 
liberal 
of 
praise 
and 
commendation 
to 
others, 
in 
that, 
wherein 
a 
man’s 
self 
hath 
any 
perfection. 
For 
saith 
Pliny, 
very 
wittily, 
In 
commending 
another, 
you 
do 
yourself 
right; 
for 
he 
that 
you 
commend, 
is 
either 
superior 
to 
you 
in 
that 
you 
commend, 
or 
inferior. 
If 
he 
be 
inferior, 
if 
he 
be 
to 
be 
commended, 
you 
much 
more; 
if 
he 
be 
superior, 
if 
he 
be 
not 
to 
be 
commended, 
you 
much 
less. 
Glorious 
men 
are 
the 
scorn 
of 
wise 
men, 
the 
admiration 
of 
fools, 
the 
idols 
of 
parasites, 
and 
the 
slaves 
of 
their 
own 
vaunts. 



F 
HONOR 
AND 
REPUTATION 


The 
winning 
of 
honor, 
is 
but 
the 
revealing 
of 
a 
man’s 
virtue 
and 
worth, 
without 
disadvantage. 
For 
some 
in 
their 
actions, 
do 
woo 
and 
effect 
honor 
and 
reputation, 
which 
sort 
of 
men, 
are 
commonly 
much 
talked 
of, 
but 
inwardly 
little 
admired. 
And 
some, 
contrariwise, 
darken 
their 
virtue 
in 
the 
show 
of 
it; 
so 
as 
they 
be 
undervalued 
in 
opinion. 
If 
a 
man 
perform 
that, 
which 
hath 
not 
been 
attempted 
before; 
or 
attempted 
and 
given 
over; 
or 
hath 
been 
achieved, 
but 
not 
with 
so 
good 
circumstance; 
he 
shall 
purchase 
more 
honor, 
than 
by 
effecting 
a 
matter 
of 
greater 
difficulty 
or 
virtue, 
wherein 
he 
is 
but 
a 
follower. 
If 
a 
man 
so 
temper 
his 
actions, 
as 
in 
some 
one 
of 
them 
he 
doth 
content 
every 
faction, 
or 
combination 
of 
people, 
the 
music 
will 
be 
the 
fuller. 
A 
man 
is 
an 
ill 
husband 
of 
his 
honor, 
that 
entereth 
into 
any 
action, 
the 
failing 
wherein 
may 
disgrace 
him, 
more 
than 
the 
carrying 
of 
it 
through, 
can 
honor 
him. 
Honor 
that 
is 
gained 
and 
broken 
upon 
another, 
hath 
the 
quickest 
reflection, 
like 
diamonds 
cut 
with 
facets. 
And 
therefore, 
let 
a 
man 
contend 
to 
excel 
any 
competitors 
of 
his 
in 
honor, 
in 
outshooting 
them, 
if 
he 
can, 
in 
their 
own 
bow. 
Discreet 
followers 
and 
servants, 
help 
much 
to 
reputation. 
Omnis 
fama 
a 
domesticis 
emanat. 
Envy, 
which 
is 
the 
canker 
of 
honor, 
is 
best 
extinguished 
by 
declaring 
a 
man’s 
self 
in 
his 
ends, 
rather 
to 
seek 
merit 
than 
fame; 
and 
by 
attributing 
a 
man’s 
successes, 
rather 
to 
divine 
Providence 
and 
felicity, 
than 
to 
his 
own 
virtue 
or 
policy. 


The 
true 
marshalling 
of 
the 
degrees 
of 
sovereign 
honor, 
are 
these: 
In 
the 
first 
place 
are 
conditores 
imperiorum, 
founders 
of 
states 
and 
commonwealths; 
such 
as 
were 
Romulus, 
Cyrus, 
Caesar, 
Ottoman, 
Ismael. 
In 
the 
second 
place 
are 
legislatores, 
lawgivers; 
which 
are 
also 
called 
second 
founders, 
or 
perpetui 
principes, 
because 
they 
govern 
by 
their 
ordinances 
after 
they 
are 
gone; 
such 
were 
Lycurgus, 
Solon, 
Justinian, 
Eadgar, 
Alphonsus 
of 
Castile, 
the 
Wise, 
that 
made 
the 
Siete 
Partidas. 
In 
the 
third 
place 
are 
liberatores, 
or 
salvatores, 
such 
as 
compound 
the 
long 
miseries 
of 
civil 
wars, 
or 
deliver 
their 
countries 
from 
servitude 
of 
strangers 
or 
tyrants; 
as 
Augustus 
Caesar, 
Vespasianus, 
Aurelianus, 
Theodoricus, 
King 
Henry 
the 
Seventh 
of 
England, 
King 
Henry 
the 
Fourth 
of 
France. 
In 
the 
fourth 
place 
are 
propagatores 
or 
propugnatores 
imperii; 
such 
as 
in 
honorable 
wars 
enlarge 
their 
territories, 
or 
make 
noble 
defence 
against 
invaders. 
And 
in 
the 
last 
place 



are 
patres 
patriae; 
which 
reign 
justly, 
and 
make 
the 
times 
good 
wherein 
they 
live. 
Both 
which 
last 
kinds 
need 
no 
examples, 
they 
are 
in 
such 
number. 
Degrees 
of 
honor, 
in 
subjects, 
are, 
first 
participes 
curarum, 
those 
upon 
whom, 
princes 
do 
discharge 
the 
greatest 
weight 
of 
their 
affairs; 
their 
right 
hands, 
as 
we 
call 
them. 
The 
next 
are 
duces 
belli, 
great 
leaders 
in 
war; 
such 
as 
are 
princes’ 
lieutenants, 
and 
do 
them 
notable 
services 
in 
the 
wars. 
The 
third 
are 
gratiosi, 
favorites; 
such 
as 
exceed 
not 
this 
scantling, 
to 
be 
solace 
to 
the 
sovereign, 
and 
harmless 
to 
the 
people. 
And 
the 
fourth, 
negotiis 
pares; 
such 
as 
have 
great 
places 
under 
princes, 
and 
execute 
their 
places, 
with 
sufficiency. 
There 
is 
an 
honor, 
likewise, 
which 
may 
be 
ranked 
amongst 
the 
greatest, 
which 
happeneth 
rarely; 
that 
is, 
of 
such 
as 
sacrifice 
themselves 
to 
death 
or 
danger 
for 
the 
good 
of 
their 
country; 
as 
was 
M. 
Regulus, 
and 
the 
two 
Decii. 



OF 
JUDICATURE 


Judges 
ought 
to 
remember, 
that 
their 
office 
is 
jus 
dicere, 
and 
not 
jus 
dare; 
to 
interpret 
law, 
and 
not 
to 
make 
law, 
or 
give 
law. 
Else 
will 
it 
be 
like 
the 
authority, 
claimed 
by 
the 
Church 
of 
Rome, 
which 
under 
pretext 
of 
exposition 
of 
Scripture, 
doth 
not 
stick 
to 
add 
and 
alter; 
and 
to 
pronounce 
that 
which 
they 
do 
not 
find; 
and 
by 
show 
of 
antiquity, 
to 
introduce 
novelty. 
Judges 
ought 
to 
be 
more 
learned, 
than 
witty, 
more 
reverend, 
than 
plausible, 
and 
more 
advised, 
than 
confident. 
Above 
all 
things, 
integrity 
is 
their 
portion 
and 
proper 
virtue. 
Cursed 
(saith 
the 
law) 
is 
he 
that 
removeth 
the 
landmark. 
The 
mislayer 
of 
a 
mere-stone 
is 
to 
blame. 
But 
it 
is 
the 
unjust 
judge, 
that 
is 
the 
capital 
remover 
of 
landmarks, 
when 
he 
defineth 
amiss, 
of 
lands 
and 
property. 
One 
foul 
sentence 
doth 
more 
hurt, 
than 
many 
foul 
examples. 
For 
these 
do 
but 
corrupt 
the 
stream, 
the 
other 
corrupteth 
the 
fountain. 
So 
with 
Solomon, 
Fons 
turbatus, 
et 
vena 
corrupta, 
est 
justus 
cadens 
in 
causa 
sua 
coram 
adversario. 
The 
office 
of 
judges 
may 
have 
reference 
unto 
the 
parties 
that 
use, 
unto 
the 
advocates 
that 
plead, 
unto 
the 
clerks 
and 
ministers 
of 
justice 
underneath 
them, 
and 
to 
the 
sovereign 
or 
state 
above 
them. 


First, 
for 
the 
causes 
or 
parties 
that 
sue. 
There 
be 
(saith 
the 
Scripture) 
that 
turn 
judgment, 
into 
wormwood; 
and 
surely 
there 
be 
also, 
that 
turn 
it 
into 
vinegar; 
for 
injustice 
maketh 
it 
bitter, 
and 
delays 
make 
it 
sour. 
The 
principal 
duty 
of 
a 
judge, 
is 
to 
suppress 
force 
and 
fraud; 
whereof 
force 
is 
the 
more 
pernicious, 
when 
it 
is 
open, 
and 
fraud, 
when 
it 
is 
close 
and 
disguised. 
Add 
thereto 
contentious 
suits, 
which 
ought 
to 
be 
spewed 
out, 
as 
the 
surfeit 
of 
courts. 
A 
judge 
ought 
to 
prepare 
his 
way 
to 
a 
just 
sentence, 
as 
God 
useth 
to 
prepare 
his 
way, 
by 
raising 
valleys 
and 
taking 
down 
hills: 
so 
when 
there 
appeareth 
on 
either 
side 
an 
high 
hand, 
violent 
prosecution, 
cunning 
advantages 
taken, 
combination, 
power, 
great 
counsel, 
then 
is 
the 
virtue 
of 
a 
judge 
seen, 
to 
make 
inequality 
equal; 
that 
he 
may 
plant 
his 
judgment 
as 
upon 
an 
even 
ground. 
Qui 
fortiter 
emungit, 
elicit 
sanguinem; 
and 
where 
the 
wine-
press 
is 
hard 
wrought, 
it 
yields 
a 
harsh 
wine, 
that 
tastes 
of 
the 
grape-stone. 
Judges 
must 
beware 
of 
hard 
constructions, 
and 
strained 
inferences; 
for 
there 
is 
no 
worse 
torture, 
than 
the 
torture 
of 
laws. 
Specially 
in 
case 
of 
laws 
penal, 



they 
ought 
to 
have 
care, 
that 
that 
was 
meant 
for 
terror, 
be 
not 
turned 
into 
rigor; 
and 
that 
they 
bring 
not 
upon 
the 
people, 
that 
shower 
whereof 
the 
Scripture 
speaketh, 
Pluet 
super 
eos 
laqueos; 
for 
penal 
laws 
pressed, 
are 
a 
shower 
of 
snares 
upon 
the 
people. 
Therefore 
let 
penal 
laws, 
if 
they 
have 
been 
sleepers 
of 
long, 
or 
if 
they 
be 
grown 
unfit 
for 
the 
present 
time, 
be 
by 
wise 
judges 
confined 
in 
the 
execution: 
Judicis 
officium 
est, 
ut 
res, 
ita 
tempora 
rerum, 
etc. 
In 
causes 
of 
life 
and 
death, 
judges 
ought 
(as 
far 
as 
the 
law 
permitteth) 
in 
justice 
to 
remember 
mercy; 
and 
to 
cast 
a 
severe 
eye 
upon 
the 
example, 
but 
a 
merciful 
eye 
upon 
the 
person. 


Secondly, 
for 
the 
advocates 
and 
counsel 
that 
plead. 
Patience 
and 
gravity 
of 
hearing, 
is 
an 
essential 
part 
of 
justice; 
and 
an 
overspeaking 
judge 
is 
no 
well-tuned 
cymbal. 
It 
is 
no 
grace 
to 
a 
judge, 
first 
to 
find 
that, 
which 
he 
might 
have 
heard 
in 
due 
time 
from 
the 
bar; 
or 
to 
show 
quickness 
of 
conceit, 
in 
cutting 
off 
evidence 
or 
counsel 
too 
short; 
or 
to 
prevent 
information 
by 
questions, 
— 
though 
pertinent. 
The 
parts 
of 
a 
judge 
in 
hearing, 
are 
four: 
to 
direct 
the 
evidence; 
to 
moderate 
length, 
repetition, 
or 
impertinency 
of 
speech; 
to 
recapitulate, 
select, 
and 
collate 
the 
material 
points, 
of 
that 
which 
hath 
been 
said; 
and 
to 
give 
the 
rule 
or 
sentence. 
Whatsoever 
is 
above 
these 
is 
too 
much; 
and 
proceedeth 
either 
of 
glory, 
and 
willingness 
to 
speak, 
or 
of 
impatience 
to 
hear, 
or 
of 
shortness 
of 
memory, 
or 
of 
want 
of 
a 
staid 
and 
equal 
attention. 
It 
is 
a 
strange 
thing 
to 
see, 
that 
the 
boldness 
of 
advocates 
should 
prevail 
with 
judges; 
whereas 
they 
should 
imitate 
God, 
in 
whose 
seat 
they 
sit; 
who 
represseth 
the 
presumptuous, 
and 
giveth 
grace 
to 
the 
modest. 
But 
it 
is 
more 
strange, 
that 
judges 
should 
have 
noted 
favorites; 
which 
cannot 
but 
cause 
multiplication 
of 
fees, 
and 
suspicion 
of 
by-ways. 
There 
is 
due 
from 
the 
judge 
to 
the 
advocate, 
some 
commendation 
and 
gracing, 
where 
causes 
are 
well 
handled 
and 
fair 
pleaded; 
especially 
towards 
the 
side 
which 
obtaineth 
not; 
for 
that 
upholds 
in 
the 
client, 
the 
reputation 
of 
his 
counsel, 
and 
beats 
down 
in 
him 
the 
conceit 
of 
his 
cause. 
There 
is 
likewise 
due 
to 
the 
public, 
a 
civil 
reprehension 
of 
advocates, 
where 
there 
appeareth 
cunning 
counsel, 
gross 
neglect, 
slight 
information, 
indiscreet 
pressing, 
or 
an 
overbold 
defence. 
And 
let 
not 
the 
counsel 
at 
the 
bar, 
chop 
with 
the 
judge, 
nor 
wind 
himself 
into 
the 
handling 
of 
the 
cause 
anew, 
after 
the 
judge 
hath 
declared 
his 
sentence; 
but, 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
let 
not 
the 
judge 
meet 
the 
cause 
half 
way, 
nor 
give 
occasion 
to 
the 
party, 
to 
say 
his 
counsel 
or 
proofs 
were 
not 
heard. 


Thirdly, 
for 
that 
that 
clerks 
and 
ministers. 
The 
place 
of 
justice 
is 
an 



hallowed 
place; 
and 
therefore 
not 
only 
the 
bench, 
but 
the 
foot-place; 
and 
precincts 
and 
purprise 
thereof, 
ought 
to 
be 
preserved 
without 
scandal 
and 
corruption. 
For 
certainly 
grapes 
(as 
the 
Scripture 
saith) 
will 
not 
be 
gathered 
of 
thorns 
or 
thistles; 
either 
can 
justice 
yield 
her 
fruit 
with 
sweetness, 
amongst 
the 
briars 
and 
brambles 
of 
catching 
and 
polling 
clerks, 
and 
ministers. 
The 
attendance 
of 
courts, 
is 
subject 
to 
four 
bad 
instruments. 
First, 
certain 
persons 
that 
are 
sowers 
of 
suits; 
which 
make 
the 
court 
swell, 
and 
the 
country 
pine. 
The 
second 
sort 
is 
of 
those, 
that 
engage 
courts 
in 
quarrels 
of 
jurisdiction, 
and 
are 
not 
truly 
amici 
curiae, 
but 
parasiti 
curiae, 
in 
puffing 
a 
court 
up 
beyond 
her 
bounds, 
for 
their 
own 
scraps 
and 
advantage. 
The 
third 
sort, 
is 
of 
those 
that 
may 
be 
accounted 
the 
left 
hands 
of 
courts; 
persons 
that 
are 
full 
of 
nimble 
and 
sinister 
tricks 
and 
shifts, 
whereby 
they 
pervert 
the 
plain 
and 
direct 
courses 
of 
courts, 
and 
bring 
justice 
into 
oblique 
lines 
and 
labyrinths. 
And 
the 
fourth, 
is 
the 
poller 
and 
exacter 
of 
fees; 
which 
justifies 
the 
common 
resemblance 
of 
the 
courts 
of 
justice, 
to 
the 
bush 
whereunto, 
while 
the 
sheep 
flies 
for 
defence 
in 
weather, 
he 
is 
sure 
to 
lose 
part 
of 
his 
fleece. 
On 
the 
other 
side, 
an 
ancient 
clerk, 
skilful 
in 
precedents, 
wary 
in 
proceeding, 
and 
understanding 
in 
the 
business 
of 
the 
court, 
is 
an 
excellent 
finger 
of 
a 
court; 
and 
doth 
many 
times 
point 
the 
way 
to 
the 
judge 
himself. 


Fourthly, 
for 
that 
which 
may 
concern 
the 
sovereign 
and 
estate. 
Judges 
ought 
above 
all 
to 
remember 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
Roman 
Twelve 
Tables; 
Salus 
populi 
suprema 
lex; 
and 
to 
know 
that 
laws, 
except 
they 
be 
in 
order 
to 
that 
end, 
are 
but 
things 
captious, 
and 
oracles 
not 
well 
inspired. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
an 
happy 
thing 
in 
a 
state, 
when 
kings 
and 
states 
do 
often 
consult 
with 
judges; 
and 
again, 
when 
judges 
do 
often 
consult 
with 
the 
king 
and 
state: 
the 
one, 
when 
there 
is 
matter 
of 
law, 
intervenient 
in 
business 
of 
state; 
the 
other, 
when 
there 
is 
some 
consideration 
of 
state, 
intervenient 
in 
matter 
of 
law. 
For 
many 
times 
the 
things 
deduced 
to 
judgment 
may 
be 
meum 
and 
tuum, 
when 
the 
reason 
and 
consequence 
thereof 
may 
trench 
to 
point 
of 
estate: 
I 
call 
matter 
of 
estate, 
not 
only 
the 
parts 
of 
sovereignty, 
but 
whatsoever 
introduceth 
any 
great 
alteration, 
or 
dangerous 
precedent; 
or 
concerneth 
manifestly 
any 
great 
portion 
of 
people. 
And 
let 
no 
man 
weakly 
conceive, 
that 
just 
laws 
and 
true 
policy 
have 
any 
antipathy; 
for 
they 
are 
like 
the 
spirits 
and 
sinews, 
that 
one 
moves 
with 
the 
other. 
Let 
judges 
also 
remember, 
that 
Solomon’s 
throne 
was 
supported 
by 
lions 
on 
both 
sides: 
let 
them 
be 
lions, 
but 
yet 
lions 
under 
the 
throne; 
being 
circumspect 
that 
they 
do 
not 
check 
or 
oppose 
any 
points 
of 
sovereignty. 
Let 
not 
judges 
also 
be 



ignorant 
of 
their 
own 
right, 
as 
to 
think 
there 
is 
not 
left 
to 
them, 
as 
a 
principal 
part 
of 
their 
office, 
a 
wise 
use 
and 
application 
of 
laws. 
For 
they 
may 
remember, 
what 
the 
apostle 
saith 
of 
a 
greater 
law 
than 
theirs; 
Nos 
scimus 
quia 
lex 
bona 
est, 
modo 
quis 
ea 
utatur 
legitime. 



OF 
ANGER 


To 
seek 
to 
extinguish 
anger 
utterly, 
is 
but 
a 
bravery 
of 
the 
Stoics. 
We 
have 
better 
oracles: 
Be 
angry, 
but 
sin 
not. 
Let 
not 
the 
sun 
go 
down 
upon 
your 
anger. 
Anger 
must 
be 
limited 
and 
confined, 
both 
in 
race 
and 
in 
time. 
We 
will 
first 
speak 
how 
the 
natural 
inclination 
and 
habit 
to 
be 
angry, 
may 
be 
attempted 
and 
calmed. 
Secondly, 
how 
the 
particular 
motions 
of 
anger 
may 
be 
repressed, 
or 
at 
least 
refrained 
from 
doing 
mischief. 
Thirdly, 
how 
to 
raise 
anger, 
or 
appease 
anger 
in 
another. 


For 
the 
first; 
there 
is 
no 
other 
way 
but 
to 
meditate, 
and 
ruminate 
well 
upon 
the 
effects 
of 
anger, 
how 
it 
troubles 
man’s 
life. 
And 
the 
best 
time 
to 
do 
this, 
is 
to 
look 
back 
upon 
anger, 
when 
the 
fit 
is 
thoroughly 
over. 
Seneca 
saith 
well, 
That 
anger 
is 
like 
ruin, 
which 
breaks 
itself 
upon 
that 
it 
falls. 
The 
Scripture 
exhorteth 
us 
to 
possess 
our 
souls 
in 
patience. 
Whosoever 
is 
out 
of 
patience, 
is 
out 
of 
possession 
of 
his 
soul. 
Men 
must 
not 
turn 
bees; 


... 
animasque 
in 
vulnere 
ponunt. 


Anger 
is 
certainly 
a 
kind 
of 
baseness; 
as 
it 
appears 
well 
in 
the 
weakness 
of 
those 
subjects 
in 
whom 
it 
reigns; 
children, 
women, 
old 
folks, 
sick 
folks. 
Only 
men 
must 
beware, 
that 
they 
carry 
their 
anger 
rather 
with 
scorn, 
than 
with 
fear; 
so 
that 
they 
may 
seem 
rather 
to 
be 
above 
the 
injury, 
than 
below 
it; 
which 
is 
a 
thing 
easily 
done, 
if 
a 
man 
will 
give 
law 
to 
himself 
in 
it. 


For 
the 
second 
point; 
the 
causes 
and 
motives 
of 
anger, 
are 
chiefly 
three. 
First, 
to 
be 
too 
sensible 
of 
hurt; 
for 
no 
man 
is 
angry, 
that 
feels 
not 
himself 
hurt; 
and 
therefore 
tender 
and 
delicate 
persons 
must 
needs 
be 
oft 
angry; 
they 
have 
so 
many 
things 
to 
trouble 
them, 
which 
more 
robust 
natures 
have 
little 
sense 
of. 
The 
next 
is, 
the 
apprehension 
and 
construction 
of 
the 
injury 
offered, 
to 
be, 
in 
the 
circumstances 
thereof, 
full 
of 
contempt: 
for 
contempt 
is 
that, 
which 
putteth 
an 
edge 
upon 
anger, 
as 
much 
or 
more 
than 
the 
hurt 
itself. 
And 
therefore, 
when 
men 
are 
ingenious 
in 
picking 
out 
circumstances 
of 
contempt, 
they 
do 
kindle 
their 
anger 
much. 
Lastly, 
opinion 



of 
the 
touch 
of 
a 
man’s 
reputation, 
doth 
multiply 
and 
sharpen 
anger. 
Wherein 
the 
remedy 
is, 
that 
a 
man 
should 
have, 
as 
Consalvo 
was 
wont 
to 
say, 
telam 
honoris 
crassiorem. 
But 
in 
all 
refrainings 
of 
anger, 
it 
is 
the 
best 
remedy 
to 
win 
time; 
and 
to 
make 
a 
man’s 
self 
believe, 
that 
the 
opportunity 
of 
his 
revenge 
is 
not 
yet 
come, 
but 
that 
he 
foresees 
a 
time 
for 
it; 
and 
so 
to 
still 
himself 
in 
the 
meantime, 
and 
reserve 
it. 


To 
contain 
anger 
from 
mischief, 
though 
it 
take 
hold 
of 
a 
man, 
there 
be 
two 
things, 
whereof 
you 
must 
have 
special 
caution. 
The 
one, 
of 
extreme 
bitterness 
of 
words, 
especially 
if 
they 
be 
aculeate 
and 
proper; 
for 
cummunia 
maledicta 
are 
nothing 
so 
much; 
and 
again, 
that 
in 
anger 
a 
man 
reveal 
no 
secrets; 
for 
that, 
makes 
him 
not 
fit 
for 
society. 
The 
other, 
that 
you 
do 
not 
peremptorily 
break 
off, 
in 
any 
business, 
in 
a 
fit 
of 
anger; 
but 
howsoever 
you 
show 
bitterness, 
do 
not 
act 
anything, 
that 
is 
not 
revocable. 


For 
raising 
and 
appeasing 
anger 
in 
another; 
it 
is 
done 
chiefly 
by 
choosing 
of 
times, 
when 
men 
are 
frowardest 
and 
worst 
disposed, 
to 
incense 
them. 
Again, 
by 
gathering 
(as 
was 
touched 
before) 
all 
that 
you 
can 
find 
out, 
to 
aggravate 
the 
contempt. 
And 
the 
two 
remedies 
are 
by 
the 
contraries. 
The 
former 
to 
take 
good 
times, 
when 
first 
to 
relate 
to 
a 
man 
an 
angry 
business; 
for 
the 
first 
impression 
is 
much; 
and 
the 
other 
is, 
to 
sever, 
as 
much 
as 
may 
be, 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
injury 
from 
the 
point 
of 
contempt; 
imputing 
it 
to 
misunderstanding, 
fear, 
passion, 
or 
what 
you 
will. 



OF 
VICISSITUDE 
OF 
THINGS 


Solomon 
saith, 
There 
is 
no 
new 
thing 
upon 
the 
earth. 
So 
that 
as 
Plato 
had 
an 
imagination, 
That 
all 
knowledge 
was 
but 
remembrance; 
so 
Solomon 
giveth 
his 
sentence, 
That 
all 
novelty 
is 
but 
oblivion. 
Whereby 
you 
may 
see, 
that 
the 
river 
of 
Lethe 
runneth 
as 
well 
above 
ground 
as 
below. 
There 
is 
an 
abstruse 
astrologer 
that 
saith, 
If 
it 
were 
not 
for 
two 
things 
that 
are 
constant 
(the 
one 
is, 
that 
the 
fixed 
stars 
ever 
stand 
a 
like 
distance 
one 
from 
another, 
and 
never 
come 
nearer 
together, 
nor 
go 
further 
asunder; 
the 
other, 
that 
the 
diurnal 
motion 
perpetually 
keepeth 
time), 
no 
individual 
would 
last 
one 
moment. 
Certain 
it 
is, 
that 
the 
matter 
is 
in 
a 
perpetual 
flux, 
and 
never 
at 
a 
stay. 
The 
great 
winding-sheets, 
that 
bury 
all 
things 
in 
oblivion, 
are 
two; 
deluges 
and 
earthquakes. 
As 
for 
conflagrations 
and 
great 
droughts, 
they 
do 
not 
merely 
dispeople 
and 
destroy. 
Phadton’s 
car 
went 
but 
a 
day. 
And 
the 
three 
years’ 
drought 
in 
the 
time 
of 
Elias, 
was 
but 
particular, 
and 
left 
people 
alive. 
As 
for 
the 
great 
burnings 
by 
lightnings, 
which 
are 
often 
in 
the 
West 
Indies, 
they 
are 
but 
narrow. 
But 
in 
the 
other 
two 
destructions, 
by 
deluge 
and 
earthquake, 
it 
is 
further 
to 
be 
noted, 
that 
the 
remnant 
of 
people 
which 
hap 
to 
be 
reserved, 
are 
commonly 
ignorant 
and 
mountainous 
people, 
that 
can 
give 
no 
account 
of 
the 
time 
past; 
so 
that 
the 
oblivion 
is 
all 
one, 
as 
if 
none 
had 
been 
left. 
If 
you 
consider 
well 
of 
the 
people 
of 
the 
West 
Indies, 
it 
is 
very 
probable 
that 
they 
are 
a 
newer 
or 
a 
younger 
people, 
than 
the 
people 
of 
the 
Old 
World. 
And 
it 
is 
much 
more 
likely, 
that 
the 
destruction 
that 
hath 
heretofore 
been 
there, 
was 
not 
by 
earthquakes 
(as 
the 
Egyptian 
priest 
told 
Solon 
concerning 
the 
island 
of 
Atlantis, 
that 
it 
was 
swallowed 
by 
an 
earthquake), 
but 
rather 
that 
it 
was 
desolated 
by 
a 
particular 
deluge. 
For 
earthquakes 
are 
seldom 
in 
those 
parts. 
But 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
they 
have 
such 
pouring 
rivers, 
as 
the 
rivers 
of 
Asia 
and 
Africk 
and 
Europe, 
are 
but 
brooks 
to 
them. 
Their 
Andes, 
likewise, 
or 
mountains, 
are 
far 
higher 
than 
those 
with 
us; 
whereby 
it 
seems, 
that 
the 
remnants 
of 
generation 
of 
men, 
were 
in 
such 
a 
particular 
deluge 
saved. 
As 
for 
the 
observation 
that 
Machiavel 
hath, 
that 
the 
jealousy 
of 
sects, 
doth 
much 
extinguish 
the 
memory 
of 
things; 
traducing 
Gregory 
the 
Great, 
that 
he 
did 
what 
in 
him 
lay, 
to 
extinguish 
all 
heathen 
antiquities; 
I 
do 
not 
find 
that 
those 
zeals 
do 
any 
great 
effects, 
nor 
last 
long; 
as 
it 
appeared 
in 
the 
succession 
of 
Sabinian, 
who 
did 
revive 
the 
former 
antiquities. 



The 
vicissitude 
of 
mutations 
in 
the 
superior 
globe, 
are 
no 
fit 
matter 
for 
this 
present 
argument. 
It 
may 
be, 
Plato’s 
great 
year, 
if 
the 
world 
should 
last 
so 
long, 
would 
have 
some 
effect; 
not 
in 
renewing 
the 
state 
of 
like 
individuals 
(for 
that 
is 
the 
fume 
of 
those, 
that 
conceive 
the 
celestial 
bodies 
have 
more 
accurate 
influences 
upon 
these 
things 
below, 
than 
indeed 
they 
have), 
but 
in 
gross. 
Comets, 
out 
of 
question, 
have 
likewise 
power 
and 
effect, 
over 
the 
gross 
and 
mass 
of 
things; 
but 
they 
are 
rather 
gazed 
upon, 
and 
waited 
upon 
in 
their 
journey, 
than 
wisely 
observed 
in 
their 
effects; 
specially 
in 
their 
respective 
effects; 
that 
is, 
what 
kind 
of 
comet, 
for 
magnitude, 
color, 
version 
of 
the 
beams, 
placing 
in 
the 
reign 
of 
heaven, 
or 
lasting, 
produceth 
what 
kind 
of 
effects. 


There 
is 
a 
toy 
which 
I 
have 
heard, 
and 
I 
would 
not 
have 
it 
given 
over, 
but 
waited 
upon 
a 
little. 
They 
say 
it 
is 
observed 
in 
the 
Low 
Countries 
(I 
know 
not 
in 
what 
part) 
that 
every 
five 
and 
thirty 
years, 
the 
same 
kind 
and 
suit 
of 
years 
and 
weathers 
come 
about 
again; 
as 
great 
frosts, 
great 
wet, 
great 
droughts, 
warm 
winters, 
summers 
with 
little 
heat, 
and 
the 
like; 
and 
they 
call 
it 
the 
Prime. 
It 
is 
a 
thing 
I 
do 
the 
rather 
mention, 
because, 
computing 
backwards, 
I 
have 
found 
some 
concurrence. 


But 
to 
leave 
these 
points 
of 
nature, 
and 
to 
come 
to 
men. 
greatest 
vicissitude 
of 
things 
amongst 
men, 
is 
the 
vicissitude 
of 
sects 
and 
religions. 
For 
those 
orbs 
rule 
in 
men’s 
minds 
most. 
The 
true 
religion 
is 
built 
upon 
the 
rock; 
the 
rest 
are 
tossed, 
upon 
the 
waves 
of 
time. 
To 
speak, 
therefore, 
of 
the 
causes 
of 
new 
sects; 
and 
to 
give 
some 
counsel 
concerning 
them, 
as 
far 
as 
the 
weakness 
of 
human 
judgment 
can 
give 
stay, 
to 
so 
great 
revolutions. 


When 
the 
religion 
formerly 
received, 
is 
rent 
by 
discords; 
and 
when 
the 
holiness 
of 
the 
professors 
of 
religion, 
is 
decayed 
and 
full 
of 
scandal; 
and 
withal 
the 
times 
be 
stupid, 
ignorant, 
and 
barbarous; 
you 
may 
doubt 
the 
springing 
up 
of 
a 
new 
sect; 
if 
then 
also, 
there 
should 
arise 
any 
extravagant 
and 
strange 
spirit, 
to 
make 
himself 
author 
thereof. 
All 
which 
points 
held, 
when 
Mahomet 
published 
his 
law. 
If 
a 
new 
sect 
have 
not 
two 
properties, 
fear 
it 
not; 
for 
it 
will 
not 
spread. 
The 
one 
is 
the 
supplanting, 
or 
the 
opposing, 
of 
authority 
established; 
for 
nothing 
is 
more 
popular 
than 
that. 
The 
other 
is 
the 
giving 
license 
to 
pleasures, 
and 
a 
voluptuous 
life. 
For 
as 
for 
speculative 
heresies 
(such 
as 
were 
in 
ancient 
times 
the 
Arians, 
and 
now 
the 
Arminians), 
though 
they 
work 
mightily 
upon 
men’s 
wits, 
yet 
they 
do 
not 
produce 
any 
great 
alterations 
in 
states; 
except 
it 
be 
by 
the 
help 
of 
civil 
occasions. 
There 
be 



three 
manner 
of 
plantations 
of 
new 
sects. 
By 
the 
power 
of 
signs 
and 
miracles; 
by 
the 
eloquence, 
and 
wisdom, 
of 
speech 
and 
persuasion; 
and 
by 
the 
sword. 
For 
martyrdoms, 
I 
reckon 
them 
amongst 
miracles; 
because 
they 
seem 
to 
exceed 
the 
strength 
of 
human 
nature: 
and 
I 
may 
do 
the 
like, 
of 
superlative 
and 
admirable 
holiness 
of 
life. 
Surely 
there 
is 
no 
better 
way, 
to 
stop 
the 
rising 
of 
new 
sects 
and 
schisms, 
than 
to 
reform 
abuses; 
to 
compound 
the 
smaller 
differences; 
to 
proceed 
mildly, 
and 
not 
with 
sanguinary 
persecutions; 
and 
rather 
to 
take 
off 
the 
principal 
authors 
by 
winning 
and 
advancing 
them, 
than 
to 
enrage 
them 
by 
violence 
and 
bitterness. 


The 
changes 
and 
vicissitude 
in 
wars 
are 
many; 
but 
chiefly 
in 
three 
things; 
in 
the 
seats 
or 
stages 
of 
the 
war; 
in 
the 
weapons; 
and 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
the 
conduct. 
Wars 
in 
ancient 
time, 
seemed 
more 
to 
move 
from 
east 
to 
west; 
for 
the 
Persians, 
Assyrians, 
Arabians, 
Tartars 
(which 
were 
the 
invaders) 
were 
all 
eastern 
people. 
It 
is 
true, 
the 
Gauls 
were 
western; 
but 
we 
read 
but 
of 
two 
incursions 
of 
theirs: 
the 
one 
to 
Gallo–Grecia, 
the 
other 
to 
Rome. 
But 
east 
and 
west 
have 
no 
certain 
points 
of 
heaven; 
and 
no 
more 
have 
the 
wars 
either 
from 
the 
east 
or 
west, 
any 
certainty 
of 
observation. 
But 
north 
and 
south 
are 
fixed; 
and 
it 
hath 
seldom 
or 
never 
been 
seen 
that 
the 
far 
southern 
people 
have 
invaded 
the 
northern, 
but 
contrariwise. 
Whereby 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
the 
northern 
tract 
of 
the 
world, 
is 
in 
nature 
the 
more 
martial 
region: 
be 
it 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
stars 
of 
that 
hemisphere; 
or 
of 
the 
great 
continents 
that 
are 
upon 
the 
north, 
whereas 
the 
south 
part, 
for 
aught 
that 
is 
known, 
is 
almost 
all 
sea; 
or 
(which 
is 
most 
apparent) 
of 
the 
cold 
of 
the 
northern 
parts, 
which 
is 
that 
which, 
without 
aid 
of 
discipline, 
doth 
make 
the 
bodies 
hardest, 
and 
the 
courages 
warmest. 


Upon 
the 
breaking 
and 
shivering 
of 
a 
great 
state 
and 
empire, 
you 
may 
be 
sure 
to 
have 
wars. 
For 
great 
empires, 
while 
they 
stand, 
do 
enervate 
and 
destroy 
the 
forces 
of 
the 
natives 
which 
they 
have 
subdued, 
resting 
upon 
their 
own 
protecting 
forces; 
and 
then 
when 
they 
fail 
also, 
all 
goes 
to 
ruin, 
and 
they 
become 
a 
prey. 
So 
was 
it 
in 
the 
decay 
of 
the 
Roman 
empire; 
and 
likewise 
in 
the 
empire 
of 
Almaigne, 
after 
Charles 
the 
Great, 
every 
bird 
taking 
a 
feather; 
and 
were 
not 
unlike 
to 
befall 
to 
Spain, 
if 
it 
should 
break. 
The 
great 
accessions 
and 
unions 
of 
kingdoms, 
do 
likewise 
stir 
up 
wars; 
for 
when 
a 
state 
grows 
to 
an 
over-power, 
it 
is 
like 
a 
great 
flood, 
that 
will 
be 
sure 
to 
overflow. 
As 
it 
hath 
been 
seen 
in 
the 
states 
of 
Rome, 
Turkey, 
Spain, 
and 
others. 
Look 
when 
the 
world 
hath 
fewest 
barbarous 
peoples, 
but 
such 
as 
commonly 
will 



not 
marry 
or 
generate, 
except 
they 
know 
means 
to 
live 
(as 
it 
is 
almost 
everywhere 
at 
this 
day, 
except 
Tartary), 
there 
is 
no 
danger 
of 
inundations 
of 
people; 
but 
when 
there 
be 
great 
shoals 
of 
people, 
which 
go 
on 
to 
populate, 
without 
foreseeing 
means 
of 
life 
and 
sustentation, 
it 
is 
of 
necessity 
that 
once 
in 
an 
age 
or 
two, 
they 
discharge 
a 
portion 
of 
their 
people 
upon 
other 
nations; 
which 
the 
ancient 
northern 
people 
were 
wont 
to 
do 
by 
lot; 
casting 
lots 
what 
part 
should 
stay 
at 
home, 
and 
what 
should 
seek 
their 
fortunes. 
When 
a 
warlike 
state 
grows 
soft 
and 
effeminate, 
they 
may 
be 
sure 
of 
a 
war. 
For 
commonly 
such 
states 
are 
grown 
rich 
in 
the 
time 
of 
their 
degenerating; 
and 
so 
the 
prey 
inviteth, 
and 
their 
decay 
in 
valor, 
encourageth 
a 
war. 


As 
for 
the 
weapons, 
it 
hardly 
falleth 
under 
rule 
and 
observation: 
yet 
we 
see 
even 
they, 
have 
returns 
and 
vicissitudes. 
For 
certain 
it 
is, 
that 
ordnance 
was 
known 
in 
the 
city 
of 
the 
Oxidrakes 
in 
India; 
and 
was 
that, 
which 
the 
Macedonians 
called 
thunder 
and 
lightning, 
and 
magic. 
And 
it 
is 
well 
known 
that 
the 
use 
of 
ordnance, 
hath 
been 
in 
China 
above 
two 
thousand 
years. 
The 
conditions 
of 
weapons, 
and 
their 
improvement, 
are; 
First, 
the 
fetching 
afar 
off; 
for 
that 
outruns 
the 
danger; 
as 
it 
is 
seen 
in 
ordnance 
and 
muskets. 
Secondly, 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
percussion; 
wherein 
likewise 
ordnance 
do 
exceed 
all 
arietations 
and 
ancient 
inventions. 
The 
third 
is, 
the 
commodious 
use 
of 
them; 
as 
that 
they 
may 
serve 
in 
all 
weathers; 
that 
the 
carriage 
may 
be 
light 
and 
manageable; 
and 
the 
like. 


For 
the 
conduct 
of 
the 
war: 
at 
the 
first, 
men 
rested 
extremely 
upon 
number: 
they 
did 
put 
the 
wars 
likewise 
upon 
main 
force 
and 
valor; 
pointing 
days 
for 
pitched 
fields, 
and 
so 
trying 
it 
out 
upon 
an 
even 
match 
and 
they 
were 
more 
ignorant 
in 
ranging 
and 
arraying 
their 
battles. 
After, 
they 
grew 
to 
rest 
upon 
number 
rather 
competent, 
than 
vast; 
they 
grew 
to 
advantages 
of 
place, 
cunning 
diversions, 
and 
the 
like: 
and 
they 
grew 
more 
skilful 
in 
the 
ordering 
of 
their 
battles. 


In 
the 
youth 
of 
a 
state, 
arms 
do 
flourish; 
in 
the 
middle 
age 
of 
a 
state, 
learning; 
and 
then 
both 
of 
them 
together 
for 
a 
time; 
in 
the 
declining 
age 
of 
a 
state, 
mechanical 
arts 
and 
merchandize. 
Learning 
hath 
his 
infancy, 
when 
it 
is 
but 
beginning 
and 
almost 
childish; 
then 
his 
youth, 
when 
it 
is 
luxuriant 
and 
juvenile; 
then 
his 
strength 
of 
years, 
when 
it 
is 
solid 
and 
reduced; 
and 
lastly, 
his 
old 
age, 
when 
it 
waxeth 
dry 
and 
exhaust. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
good 
to 
look 
too 
long 
upon 
these 
turning 
wheels 
of 
vicissitude, 
lest 
we 
become 
giddy. 
As 
for 
the 
philology 
of 
them, 
that 
is 
but 
a 
circle 
of 
tales, 
and 
therefore 
not 
fit 
for 
this 



writing. 



OF 
FAME 


The 
poets 
make 
Fame 
a 
monster. 
They 
describe 
her 
in 
part 
finely 
and 
elegantly, 
and 
in 
part 
gravely 
and 
sententiously. 
They 
say, 
look 
how 
many 
feathers 
she 
hath, 
so 
many 
eyes 
she 
hath 
underneath; 
so 
many 
tongues; 
so 
many 
voices; 
she 
pricks 
up 
so 
many 
ears. 


This 
is 
a 
flourish. 
There 
follow 
excellent 
parables; 
as 
that, 
she 
gathereth 
strength 
in 
going; 
that 
she 
goeth 
upon 
the 
ground, 
and 
yet 
hideth 
her 
head 
in 
the 
clouds; 
that 
in 
the 
daytime 
she 
sitteth 
in 
a 
watch 
tower, 
and 
flieth 
most 
by 
night; 
that 
she 
mingleth 
things 
done, 
with 
things 
not 
done; 
and 
that 
she 
is 
a 
terror 
to 
great 
cities. 
But 
that 
which 
passeth 
all 
the 
rest 
is: 
They 
do 
recount 
that 
the 
Earth, 
mother 
of 
the 
giants 
that 
made 
war 
against 
Jupiter, 
and 
were 
by 
him 
destroyed, 
thereupon 
in 
an 
anger 
brought 
forth 
Fame. 
For 
certain 
it 
is, 
that 
rebels, 
figured 
by 
the 
giants, 
and 
seditious 
fames 
and 
libels, 
are 
but 
brothers 
and 
sisters, 
masculine 
and 
feminine. 
But 
now, 
if 
a 
man 
can 
tame 
this 
monster, 
and 
bring 
her 
to 
feed 
at 
the 
hand, 
and 
govern 
her, 
and 
with 
her 
fly 
other 
ravening 
fowl 
and 
kill 
them, 
it 
is 
somewhat 
worth. 
But 
we 
are 
infected 
with 
the 
style 
of 
the 
poets. 
To 
speak 
now 
in 
a 
sad 
and 
serious 
manner: 
There 
is 
not, 
in 
all 
the 
politics, 
a 
place 
less 
handled 
and 
more 
worthy 
to 
be 
handled, 
than 
this 
of 
fame. 
We 
will 
therefore 
speak 
of 
these 
points: 
What 
are 
false 
fames; 
and 
what 
are 
true 
fames; 
and 
how 
they 
may 
be 
best 
discerned; 
how 
fames 
may 
be 
sown, 
and 
raised; 
how 
they 
may 
be 
spread, 
and 
multiplied; 
and 
how 
they 
may 
be 
checked, 
and 
laid 
dead. 
And 
other 
things 
concerning 
the 
nature 
of 
fame. 
Fame 
is 
of 
that 
force, 
as 
there 
is 
scarcely 
any 
great 
action, 
wherein 
it 
hath 
not 
a 
great 
part; 
especially 
in 
the 
war. 
Mucianus 
undid 
Vitellius, 
by 
a 
fame 
that 
he 
scattered, 
that 
Vitellius 
had 
in 
purpose 
to 
remove 
the 
legions 
of 
Syria 
into 
Germany, 
and 
the 
legions 
of 
Germany 
into 
Syria; 
whereupon 
the 
legions 
of 
Syria 
were 
infinitely 
inflamed. 
Julius 
Caesar 
took 
Pompey 
unprovided, 
and 
laid 
asleep 
his 
industry 
and 
preparations, 
by 
a 
fame 
that 
he 
cunningly 
gave 
out: 
Caesar’s 
own 
soldiers 
loved 
him 
not, 
and 
being 
wearied 
with 
the 
wars, 
and 
laden 
with 
the 
spoils 
of 
Gaul, 
would 
forsake 
him, 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
came 
into 
Italy. 
Livia 
settled 
all 
things 
for 
the 
succession 
of 
her 
son 
Tiberius, 
by 
continual 
giving 
out, 
that 
her 
husband 
Augustus 
was 



upon 
recovery 
and 
amendment, 
and 
it 
is 
an 
usual 
thing 
with 
the 
pashas, 
to 
conceal 
the 
death 
of 
the 
Great 
Turk 
from 
the 
janizaries 
and 
men 
of 
war, 
to 
save 
the 
sacking 
of 
Constantinople 
and 
other 
towns, 
as 
their 
manner 
is. 
Themistocles 
made 
Xerxes, 
king 
of 
Persia, 
post 
apace 
out 
of 
Grecia, 
by 
giving 
out, 
that 
the 
Grecians 
had 
a 
purpose 
to 
break 
his 
bridge 
of 
ships, 
which 
he 
had 
made 
athwart 
Hellespont. 
There 
be 
a 
thousand 
such 
like 
examples; 
and 
the 
more 
they 
are, 
the 
less 
they 
need 
to 
be 
repeated; 
because 
a 
man 
meeteth 
with 
them 
everywhere. 
Therefore 
let 
all 
wise 
governors 
have 
as 
great 
a 
watch 
and 
care 
over 
fames, 
as 
they 
have 
of 
the 
actions 
and 
designs 
themselves.

The 
New 
Atlantis 



WE 
sailed 
from 
Peru, 
where 
we 
had 
continued 
by 
the 
space 
of 
one 
whole 
year, 
for 
China 
and 
Japan, 
by 
the 
South 
Sea, 
taking 
with 
us 
victuals 
for 
twelve 
months; 
and 
had 
good 
winds 
from 
the 
east, 
though 
soft 
and 
weak, 
for 
five 
months’ 
space 
and 
more. 
But 
then 
the 
wind 
came 
about, 
and 
settled 
in 
the 
west 
for 
many 
days, 
so 
as 
we 
could 
make 
little 
or 
no 
way, 
and 
were 
sometimes 
in 
purpose 
to 
turn 
back. 
But 
then 
again 
there 
arose 
strong 
and 
great 
winds 
from 
the 
south, 
with 
a 
point 
east; 
which 
carried 
us 
up, 
for 
all 
that 
we 
could 
do, 
toward 
the 
north: 
by 
which 
time 
our 
victuals 
failed 
us, 
though 
we 
had 
made 
good 
spare 
of 
them. 
So 
that 
finding 
ourselves, 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
greatest 
wilderness 
of 
waters 
in 
the 
world, 
without 
victual, 
we 
gave 
ourselves 
for 
lost 
men, 
and 
prepared 
for 
death. 
Yet 
we 
did 
lift 
up 
our 
hearts 
and 
voices 
to 
God 
above, 
who 
showeth 
His 
wonders 
in 
the 
deep; 
beseeching 
Him 
of 
His 
mercy 
that 
as 
in 
the 
beginning 
He 
discovered 
the 
face 
of 
the 
deep, 
and 
brought 
forth 
dry 
land, 
so 
He 
would 
now 
discover 
land 
to 
us, 
that 
we 
might 
not 
perish. 


And 
it 
came 
to 
pass 
that 
the 
next 
day 
about 
evening 
we 
saw 
within 
a 
kenning 
before 
us, 
toward 
the 
north, 
as 
it 
were 
thick 
clouds, 
which 
did 
put 
us 
in 
some 
hope 
of 
land, 
knowing 
how 
that 
part 
of 
the 
South 
Sea 
was 
utterly 
unknown, 
and 
might 
have 
islands 
or 
continents 
that 
hitherto 
were 
not 
come 
to 
light. 
Wherefore 
we 
bent 
our 
course 
thither, 
where 
we 
saw 
the 
appearance 
of 
land, 
all 
that 
night; 
and 
in 
the 
dawning 
of 
next 
day 
we 
might 
plainly 
discern 
that 
it 
was 
a 
land 
flat 
to 
our 
sight, 
and 
full 
of 
boscage, 
which 
made 
it 
show 
the 
more 
dark. 
And 
after 
an 
hour 
and 
a 
half’s 
sailing, 
we 
entered 
into 
a 
good 
haven, 
being 
the 
port 
of 
a 
fair 
city. 
Not 
great, 
indeed, 
but 
well 
built, 
and 
that 
gave 
a 
pleasant 
view 
from 
the 
sea. 
And 
we 
thinking 
every 
minute 
long 
till 
we 
were 
on 
land, 
came 
close 
to 
the 
shore 
and 
offered 
to 
land. 
But 
straightway 
we 
saw 
divers 
of 
the 
people, 
with 
batons 
in 
their 
hands, 
as 
it 
were 
forbidding 
us 
to 
land: 
yet 
without 
any 
cries 
or 
fierceness, 
but 
only 
as 
warning 
us 
off, 
by 
signs 
that 
they 
made. 
Whereupon 
being 
not 
a 
little 
discomfited, 
we 
were 
advising 
with 
ourselves 
what 
we 
should 
do. 
During 
which 
time 
there 
made 
forth 
to 
us 
a 
small 
boat, 
with 
about 
eight 
persons 
in 
it, 
whereof 
one 
of 
them 
had 
in 
his 
hand 
a 
tipstaff 
of 
a 
yellow 
cane, 
tipped 
at 
both 
ends 
with 
blue, 
who 
made 
aboard 
our 
ship, 
without 
any 
show 
of 
distrust 
at 
all. 
And 
when 
he 
saw 
one 
of 
our 
number 
present 
himself 
somewhat 
afore 
the 
rest, 
he 
drew 
forth 
a 
little 
scroll 
of 
parchment 
(somewhat 
yellower 
than 
our 
parchment, 
and 



shining 
like 
the 
leaves 
of 
writingtables, 
but 
otherwise 
soft 
and 
flexible), 
and 
delivered 
it 
to 
our 
foremost 
man. 
In 
which 
scroll 
were 
written 
in 
ancient 
Hebrew, 
and 
in 
ancient 
Greek, 
and 
in 
good 
Latin 
of 
the 
school, 
and 
in 
Spanish 
these 
words: 
“Land 
ye 
not, 
none 
of 
you, 
and 
provide 
to 
be 
gone 
from 
this 
coast 
within 
sixteen 
days, 
except 
you 
have 
further 
time 
given 
you; 
meanwhile, 
if 
you 
want 
fresh 
water, 
or 
victual, 
or 
help 
for 
your 
sick, 
or 
that 
your 
ship 
needeth 
repair, 
write 
down 
your 
wants, 
and 
you 
shall 
have 
that 
which 
belongeth 
to 
mercy.” 
This 
scroll 
was 
signed 
with 
a 
stamp 
of 
cherubim’s 
wings, 
not 
spread, 
but 
hanging 
downward; 
and 
by 
them 
a 
cross. 


This 
being 
delivered, 
the 
officer 
returned, 
and 
left 
only 
a 
servant 
with 
us 
to 
receive 
our 
answer. 
Consulting 
hereupon 
among 
ourselves, 
we 
were 
much 
perplexed. 
The 
denial 
of 
landing, 
and 
hasty 
warning 
us 
away, 
troubled 
us 
much: 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
to 
find 
that 
the 
people 
had 
languages, 
and 
were 
so 
full 
of 
humanity, 
did 
comfort 
us 
not 
a 
little. 
And 
above 
all, 
the 
sign 
of 
the 
cross 
to 
that 
instrument 
was 
to 
us 
a 
great 
rejoicing, 
and 
as 
it 
were 
a 
certain 
presage 
of 
good. 
Our 
answer 
was 
in 
the 
Spanish 
tongue, 
“That 
for 
our 
ship, 
it 
was 
well; 
for 
we 
had 
rather 
met 
with 
calms 
and 
contrary 
winds, 
than 
any 
tempests. 
For 
our 
sick, 
they 
were 
many, 
and 
in 
very 
ill 
case; 
so 
that 
if 
they 
were 
not 
permitted 
to 
land, 
they 
ran 
in 
danger 
of 
their 
lives.” 
Our 
other 
wants 
we 
set 
down 
in 
particular, 
adding, 
“That 
we 
had 
some 
little 
store 
of 
merchandise, 
which 
if 
it 
pleased 
them 
to 
deal 
for, 
it 
might 
supply 
our 
wants, 
without 
being 
chargeable 
unto 
them.” 
We 
offered 
some 
reward 
in 
pistolets 
unto 
the 
servant, 
and 
a 
piece 
of 
crimson 
velvet 
to 
be 
presented 
to 
the 
officer; 
but 
the 
servant 
took 
them 
not, 
nor 
would 
scarce 
look 
upon 
them; 
and 
so 
left 
us, 
and 
went 
back 
in 
another 
little 
boat 
which 
was 
sent 
for 
him. 


About 
three 
hours 
after 
we 
had 
despatched 
our 
answer, 
there 
came 
toward 
us 
a 
person 
(as 
it 
seemed) 
of 
a 
place. 
He 
had 
on 
him 
a 
gown 
with 
wide 
sleeves, 
of 
a 
kind 
of 
water 
chamolet, 
of 
an 
excellent 
azure 
color, 
far 
more 
glossy 
than 
ours; 
his 
under-apparel 
was 
green, 
and 
so 
was 
his 
hat, 
being 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
turban, 
daintily 
made, 
and 
not 
so 
huge 
as 
the 
Turkish 
turbans; 
and 
the 
locks 
of 
his 
hair 
came 
down 
below 
the 
brims 
of 
it. 
A 
reverend 
man 
was 
he 
to 
behold. 
He 
came 
in 
a 
boat, 
gilt 
in 
some 
part 
of 
it, 
with 
four 
persons 
more 
only 
in 
that 
boat; 
and 
was 
followed 
by 
another 
boat, 
wherein 
were 
some 
twenty. 
When 
he 
was 
come 
within 
a 
flight-shot 
of 
our 
ship, 
signs 
were 
made 
to 
us 
that 
we 
should 
send 
forth 
some 
to 
meet 
him 
upon 
the 
water, 
which 
we 
presently 
did 
in 
our 
ship-boat, 
sending 
the 
principal 
man 
amongst 
us 
save 



one, 
and 
four 
of 
our 
number 
with 
him. 
When 
we 
were 
come 
within 
six 
yards 
of 
their 
boat, 
they 
called 
to 
us 
to 
stay, 
and 
not 
to 
approach 
farther, 
which 
we 
did. 


And 
thereupon 
the 
man, 
whom 
I 
before 
described, 
stood 
up, 
and 
with 
a 
loud 
voice 
in 
Spanish 
asked, 
“Are 
ye 
Christians?” 
We 
answered, 
“We 
were;” 
fearing 
the 
less, 
because 
of 
the 
cross 
we 
had 
seen 
in 
the 
subscription. 
At 
which 
answer 
the 
said 
person 
lift 
up 
his 
right 
hand 
toward 
heaven, 
and 
drew 
it 
softly 
to 
his 
mouth 
(which 
is 
the 
gesture 
they 
use, 
when 
they 
thank 
God), 
and 
then 
said: 
“If 
ye 
will 
swear, 
all 
of 
you, 
by 
the 
merits 
of 
the 
Saviour, 
that 
ye 
are 
no 
pirates; 
nor 
have 
shed 
blood, 
lawfully 
or 
unlawfully, 
within 
forty 
days 
past; 
you 
may 
have 
license 
to 
come 
on 
land.” 
We 
said, 
“We 
were 
all 
ready 
to 
take 
that 
oath.” 
Whereupon 
one 
of 
those 
that 
were 
with 
him, 
being 
(as 
it 
seemed) 
a 
notary, 
made 
an 
entry 
of 
this 
act. 
Which 
done, 
another 
of 
the 
attendants 
of 
the 
great 
person, 
which 
was 
with 
him 
in 
the 
same 
boat, 
after 
his 
lord 
had 
spoken 
a 
little 
to 
him, 
said 
aloud: 
“My 
lord 
would 
have 
you 
know 
that 
it 
is 
not 
of 
pride, 
or 
greatness, 
that 
he 
cometh 
not 
aboard 
your 
ship; 
but 
for 
that 
in 
your 
answer 
you 
declare 
that 
you 
have 
many 
sick 
amongst 
you, 
he 
was 
warned 
by 
the 
conservator 
of 
health 
of 
the 
city 
that 
he 
should 
keep 
a 
distance.” 
We 
bowed 
ourselves 
toward 
him 
and 
answered: 
“We 
were 
his 
humble 
servants; 
and 
accounted 
for 
great 
honor 
and 
singular 
humanity 
toward 
us, 
that 
which 
was 
already 
done; 
but 
hoped 
well 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
sickness 
of 
our 
men 
was 
not 
infectious.” 


So 
he 
returned; 
and 
awhile 
after 
came 
the 
notary 
to 
us 
aboard 
our 
ship, 
holding 
in 
his 
hand 
a 
fruit 
of 
that 
country, 
like 
an 
orange, 
but 
of 
color 
between 
orange-tawny 
and 
scarlet, 
which 
cast 
a 
most 
excellent 
odor. 
He 
used 
it 
(as 
it 
seemed) 
for 
a 
preservative 
against 
infection. 
He 
gave 
us 
our 
oath, 
“By 
the 
name 
of 
Jesus, 
and 
His 
merits,” 
and 
after 
told 
us 
that 
the 
next 
day, 
by 
six 
of 
the 
clock 
in 
the 
morning, 
we 
should 
be 
sent 
to, 
and 
brought 
to 
the 
strangers’ 
house 
(so 
he 
called 
it), 
where 
we 
should 
be 
accommodated 
of 
things, 
both 
for 
our 
whole 
and 
for 
our 
sick. 
So 
he 
left 
us; 
and 
when 
we 
offered 
him 
some 
pistolets, 
he 
smiling, 
said, 
“He 
must 
not 
be 
twice 
paid 
for 
one 
labor:” 
meaning 
(as 
I 
take 
it) 
that 
he 
had 
salary 
sufficient 
of 
the 
State 
for 
his 
service. 
For 
(as 
I 
after 
learned) 
they 
call 
an 
officer 
that 
taketh 
rewards 
twice 
paid. 


The 
next 
morning 
early 
there 
came 
to 
us 
the 
same 
officer 
that 
came 
to 
us 
at 
first, 
with 
his 
cane, 
and 
told 
us 
he 
came 
to 
conduct 
us 
to 
the 



strangers’ 
house; 
and 
that 
he 
had 
prevented 
the 
hour, 
because 
we 
might 
have 
the 
whole 
day 
before 
us 
for 
our 
business. 
“For,” 
said 
he,” 
if 
you 
will 
follow 
my 
advice, 
there 
shall 
first 
go 
with 
me 
some 
few 
of 
you, 
and 
see 
the 
place, 
and 
how 
it 
may 
be 
made 
convenient 
for 
you; 
and 
then 
you 
may 
send 
for 
your 
sick, 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
your 
number 
which 
ye 
will 
bring 
on 
land.” 
We 
thanked 
him 
and 
said, 
“That 
his 
care 
which 
he 
took 
of 
desolate 
strangers, 
God 
would 
reward.” 
And 
so 
six 
of 
us 
went 
on 
land 
with 
him; 
and 
when 
we 
were 
on 
land, 
he 
went 
before 
us, 
and 
turned 
to 
us 
and 
said 
“he 
was 
but 
our 
servant 
and 
our 
guide.” 
He 
led 
us 
through 
three 
fair 
streets; 
and 
all 
the 
way 
we 
went 
there 
were 
gathered 
some 
people 
on 
both 
sides, 
standing 
in 
a 
row; 
but 
in 
so 
civil 
a 
fashion, 
as 
if 
it 
had 
been, 
not 
to 
wonder 
at 
us, 
but 
to 
welcome 
us; 
and 
divers 
of 
them, 
as 
we 
passed 
by 
them, 
put 
their 
arms 
a 
little 
abroad, 
which 
is 
their 
gesture 
when 
they 
bid 
any 
welcome. 


The 
strangers’ 
house 
is 
a 
fair 
and 
spacious 
house, 
built 
of 
brick, 
of 
somewhat 
a 
bluer 
color 
than 
our 
brick; 
and 
with 
handsome 
windows, 
some 
of 
glass, 
some 
of 
a 
kind 
of 
cambric 
oiled. 
He 
brought 
us 
first 
into 
a 
fair 
parlor 
above 
stairs, 
and 
then 
asked 
us 
“what 
number 
of 
persons 
we 
were? 
and 
how 
many 
sick?” 
We 
answered, 
“We 
were 
in 
all 
(sick 
and 
whole) 
one-and-fifty 
persons, 
whereof 
our 
sick 
were 
seventeen.” 
He 
desired 
us 
have 
patience 
a 
little, 
and 
to 
stay 
till 
he 
came 
back 
to 
us, 
which 
was 
about 
an 
hour 
after; 
and 
then 
he 
led 
us 
to 
see 
the 
chambers 
which 
were 
provided 
for 
us, 
being 
in 
number 
nineteen. 
They 
having 
cast 
it 
(as 
it 
seemeth) 
that 
four 
of 
those 
chambers, 
which 
were 
better 
than 
the 
rest, 
might 
receive 
four 
of 
the 
principal 
men 
of 
our 
company; 
and 
lodge 
them 
alone 
by 
themselves; 
and 
the 
other 
fifteen 
chambers 
were 
to 
lodge 
us, 
two 
and 
two 
together. 
The 
chambers 
were 
handsome 
and 
cheerful 
chambers, 
and 
furnished 
civilly. 
Then 
he 
led 
us 
to 
a 
long 
gallery, 
like 
a 
dorture, 
where 
he 
showed 
us 
all 
along 
the 
one 
side 
(for 
the 
other 
side 
was 
but 
wall 
and 
window) 
seventeen 
cells, 
very 
neat 
ones, 
having 
partitions 
of 
cedar 
wood. 
Which 
gallery 
and 
cells, 
being 
in 
all 
forty 
(many 
more 
than 
we 
needed), 
were 
instituted 
as 
an 
infirmary 
for 
sick 
persons. 
And 
he 
told 
us 
withal, 
that 
as 
any 
of 
our 
sick 
waxed 
well, 
he 
might 
be 
removed 
from 
his 
cell 
to 
a 
chamber; 
for 
which 
purpose 
there 
were 
set 
forth 
ten 
spare 
cham 
bers, 
besides 
the 
number 
we 
spake 
of 
before. 


This 
done, 
he 
brought 
us 
back 
to 
the 
parlor, 
and 
lifting 
up 
his 
cane 
a 
little 
(as 
they 
do 
when 
they 
give 
any 
charge 
or 
command), 
said 
to 
us: 
“Ye 
are 
to 
know 
that 
the 
custom 
of 
the 
land 
requireth 
that 
after 
this 
day 
and 
to



morrow 
(which 
we 
give 
you 
for 
removing 
your 
people 
from 
your 
ship), 
you 
are 
to 
keep 
within 
doors 
for 
three 
days. 
But 
let 
it 
not 
trouble 
you, 
nor 
do 
not 
think 
yourselves 
restrained, 
but 
rather 
left 
to 
your 
rest 
and 
ease. 
You 
shall 
want 
nothing; 
and 
there 
are 
six 
of 
our 
people 
appointed 
to 
attend 
you 
for 
any 
business 
you 
may 
have 
abroad.” 
We 
gave 
him 
thanks 
with 
all 
affection 
and 
respect, 
and 
said, 
“God 
surely 
is 
manifested 
in 
this 
land.” 
We 
offered 
him 
also 
twenty 
pistolets; 
but 
he 
smiled, 
and 
only 
said: 
“What? 
Twice 
paid!” 
And 
so 
he 
left 
us. 
Soon 
after 
our 
dinner 
was 
served 
in; 
which 
was 
right 
good 
viands, 
both 
for 
bread 
and 
meat: 
better 
than 
any 
collegiate 
diet 
that 
I 
have 
known 
in 
Europe. 
We 
had 
also 
drink 
of 
three 
sorts, 
all 
wholesome 
and 
good: 
wine 
of 
the 
grape; 
a 
drink 
of 
grain, 
such 
as 
is 
with 
us 
our 
ale, 
but 
more 
clear; 
and 
a 
kind 
of 
cider 
made 
of 
a 
fruit 
of 
that 
country, 
a 
wonderful 
pleasing 
and 
refreshing 
drink. 
Besides, 
there 
were 
brought 
in 
to 
us 
great 
store 
of 
those 
scarlet 
oranges 
for 
our 
sick; 
which 
(they 
said) 
were 
an 
assured 
remedy 
for 
sickness 
taken 
at 
sea. 
There 
was 
given 
us 
also 
a 
box 
of 
small 
gray 
or 
whitish 
pills, 
which 
they 
wished 
our 
sick 
should 
take, 
one 
of 
the 
pills 
every 
night 
before 
sleep; 
which 
(they 
said) 
would 
hasten 
their 
recovery. 


The 
next 
day, 
after 
that 
our 
trouble 
of 
carriage 
and 
removing 
of 
our 
men 
and 
goods 
out 
of 
our 
ship 
was 
somewhat 
settled 
and 
quiet, 
I 
thought 
good 
to 
call 
our 
company 
together, 
and, 
when 
they 
were 
assembled, 
said 
unto 
them: 
“My 
dear 
friends, 
let 
us 
know 
ourselves, 
and 
how 
it 
standeth 
with 
us. 
We 
are 
men 
cast 
on 
land, 
as 
Jonas 
was 
out 
of 
the 
whale’s 
belly, 
when 
we 
were 
as 
buried 
in 
the 
deep; 
and 
now 
we 
are 
on 
land, 
we 
are 
but 
between 
death 
and 
life, 
for 
we 
are 
beyond 
both 
the 
Old 
World 
and 
the 
New; 
and 
whether 
ever 
we 
shall 
see 
Europe, 
God 
only 
knoweth. 
It 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
miracle 
hath 
brought 
us 
hither, 
and 
it 
must 
be 
little 
less 
that 
shall 
bring 
us 
hence. 
Therefore 
in 
regard 
of 
our 
deliverance 
past, 
and 
our 
danger 
present 
and 
to 
come, 
let 
us 
look 
up 
to 
God, 
and 
every 
man 
reform 
his 
own 
ways. 
Besides, 
we 
are 
come 
here 
among 
a 
Christian 
people, 
full 
of 
piety 
and 
humanity. 
Let 
us 
not 
bring 
that 
confusion 
of 
face 
upon 
ourselves, 
as 
to 
show 
our 
vices 
or 
unworthiness 
before 
them. 
Yet 
there 
is 
more, 
for 
they 
have 
by 
commandment 
(though 
in 
form 
of 
courtesy) 
cloistered 
us 
within 
these 
walls 
for 
three 
days; 
who 
knoweth 
whether 
it 
be 
not 
to 
take 
some 
taste 
of 
our 
manners 
and 
conditions? 
And 
if 
they 
find 
them 
bad, 
to 
banish 
us 
straightway; 
if 
good, 
to 
give 
us 
further 
time. 
For 
these 
men 
that 
they 
have 
given 
us 
for 
attendance, 
may 
withal 
have 
an 
eye 
upon 
us. 
Therefore, 
for 
God’s 
love, 
and 
as 
we 
love 
the 
weal 
of 
our 
souls 
and 
bodies, 
let 
us 
so 
behave 
ourselves 
as 
we 
may 
be 
at 



peace 
with 
God 
and 
may 
find 
grace 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
this 
people.” 


Our 
company 
with 
one 
voice 
thanked 
me 
for 
my 
good 
admonition, 
and 
promised 
me 
to 
live 
soberly 
and 
civilly, 
and 
without 
giving 
any 
the 
least 
occasion 
of 
offence. 
So 
we 
spent 
our 
three 
days 
joyfully, 
and 
without 
care, 
in 
expectation 
what 
would 
be 
done 
with 
us 
when 
they 
were 
expired. 
During 
which 
time, 
we 
had 
every 
hour 
joy 
of 
the 
amendment 
of 
our 
sick, 
who 
thought 
themselves 
cast 
into 
some 
divine 
pool 
of 
healing, 
they 
mended 
so 
kindly 
and 
so 
fast. 


The 
morrow 
after 
our 
three 
days 
were 
past, 
there 
came 
to 
us 
a 
new 
man, 
that 
we 
had 
not 
seen 
before, 
clothed 
in 
blue 
as 
the 
former 
was, 
save 
that 
his 
turban 
was 
white 
with 
a 
small 
red 
cross 
on 
top. 
He 
had 
also 
a 
tippet 
of 
fine 
linen. 
At 
his 
coming 
in, 
he 
did 
bend 
to 
us 
a 
little, 
and 
put 
his 
arms 
abroad. 
We 
of 
our 
parts 
saluted 
him 
in 
a 
very 
lowly 
and 
submissive 
manner; 
as 
looking 
that 
from 
him 
we 
should 
receive 
sentence 
of 
life 
or 
death. 
He 
desired 
to 
speak 
with 
some 
few 
of 
us. 
Whereupon 
six 
of 
us 
only 
stayed, 
and 
the 
rest 
avoided 
the 
room. 
He 
said: 
“I 
am 
by 
office, 
governor 
of 
this 
house 
of 
strangers, 
and 
by 
vocation, 
I 
am 
a 
Christian 
priest, 
and 
therefore 
am 
come 
to 
you 
to 
offer 
you 
my 
service, 
both 
as 
strangers 
and 
chiefly 
as 
Christians. 
Some 
things 
I 
may 
tell 
you, 
which 
I 
think 
you 
will 
not 
be 
unwilling 
to 
hear. 
The 
State 
hath 
given 
you 
license 
to 
stay 
on 
land 
for 
the 
space 
of 
six 
weeks; 
and 
let 
it 
not 
trouble 
you 
if 
your 
occasions 
ask 
further 
time, 
for 
the 
law 
in 
this 
point 
is 
not 
precise; 
and 
I 
do 
not 
doubt 
but 
myself 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
obtain 
for 
you 
such 
further 
time 
as 
shall 
be 
convenient. 
Ye 
shall 
also 
understand 
that 
the 
strangers’ 
house 
is 
at 
this 
time 
rich 
and 
much 
aforehand; 
for 
it 
hath 
laid 
up 
revenue 
these 
thirty-seven 
years, 
for 
so 
long 
it 
is 
since 
any 
stranger 
arrived 
in 
this 
part; 
and 
therefore 
take 
ye 
no 
care; 
the 
State 
will 
defray 
you 
all 
the 
time 
you 
stay. 
Neither 
shall 
you 
stay 
one 
day 
the 
less 
for 
that. 
As 
for 
any 
merchandise 
you 
have 
brought, 
ye 
shall 
be 
well 
used, 
and 
have 
your 
return, 
either 
in 
merchandise 
or 
in 
gold 
and 
silver, 
for 
to 
us 
it 
is 
all 
one. 
And 
if 
you 
have 
any 
other 
request 
to 
make, 
hide 
it 
not; 
for 
ye 
shall 
find 
we 
will 
not 
make 
your 
countenance 
to 
fall 
by 
the 
answer 
ye 
shall 
receive. 
Only 
this 
I 
must 
tell 
you, 
that 
none 
of 
you 
must 
go 
above 
a 
karan 
[that 
is 
with 
them 
a 
mile 
and 
a 
half] 
from 
the 
walls 
of 
the 
city, 
without 
special 
leave.” 


We 
answered, 
after 
we 
had 
looked 
awhile 
upon 
one 
another, 
admiring 
this 
gracious 
and 
parent-like 
usage, 
that 
we 
could 
not 
tell 
what 
to 
say, 
for 
we 
wanted 
words 
to 
express 
our 
thanks; 
and 
his 
noble 
free 
offers 
left 



us 
nothing 
to 
ask. 
It 
seemed 
to 
us 
that 
we 
had 
before 
us 
a 
picture 
of 
our 
salvation 
in 
heaven; 
for 
we 
that 
were 
awhile 
since 
in 
the 
jaws 
of 
death, 
were 
now 
brought 
into 
a 
place 
where 
we 
found 
nothing 
but 
consolations. 
For 
the 
commandment 
laid 
upon 
us, 
we 
would 
not 
fail 
to 
obey 
it, 
though 
it 
was 
impossible 
but 
our 
hearts 
should 
be 
inflamed 
to 
tread 
further 
upon 
this 
happy 
and 
holy 
ground. 
We 
added 
that 
our 
tongues 
should 
first 
cleave 
to 
the 
roofs 
of 
our 
mouths 
ere 
we 
should 
forget 
either 
this 
reverend 
person 
or 
this 
whole 
nation, 
in 
our 
prayers. 
We 
also 
most 
humbly 
besought 
him 
to 
accept 
of 
us 
as 
his 
true 
servants, 
by 
as 
just 
a 
right 
as 
ever 
men 
on 
earth 
were 
bounden; 
laying 
and 
presenting 
both 
our 
persons 
and 
all 
we 
had 
at 
his 
feet. 
He 
said 
he 
was 
a 
priest, 
and 
looked 
for 
a 
priest’s 
reward, 
which 
was 
our 
brotherly 
love 
and 
the 
good 
of 
our 
souls 
and 
bodies. 
So 
he 
went 
from 
us, 
not 
without 
tears 
of 
tenderness 
in 
his 
eyes, 
and 
left 
us 
also 
confused 
with 
joy 
and 
kindness, 
saying 
among 
ourselves 
that 
we 
were 
come 
into 
a 
land 
of 
angels, 
which 
did 
appear 
to 
us 
daily, 
and 
prevent 
us 
with 
comforts, 
which 
we 
thought 
not 
of, 
much 
less 
expected. 


The 
next 
day, 
about 
ten 
of 
the 
clock; 
the 
governor 
came 
to 
us 
again, 
and 
after 
salutations 
said 
familiarly 
that 
he 
was 
come 
to 
visit 
us, 
and 
called 
for 
a 
chair 
and 
sat 
him 
down; 
and 
we, 
being 
some 
ten 
of 
us 
(the 
rest 
were 
of 
the 
meaner 
sort 
or 
else 
gone 
abroad), 
sat 
down 
with 
him; 
and 
when 
we 
were 
set 
he 
began 
thus: 
“We 
of 
this 
island 
of 
Bensalem 
(for 
so 
they 
called 
it 
in 
their 
language) 
have 
this: 
that 
by 
means 
of 
our 
solitary 
situation, 
and 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
secrecy, 
which 
we 
have 
for 
our 
travellers, 
and 
our 
rare 
admission 
of 
strangers; 
we 
know 
well 
most 
part 
of 
the 
habitable 
world, 
and 
are 
ourselves 
unknown. 
Therefore 
because 
he 
that 
knoweth 
least 
is 
fittest 
to 
ask 
questions 
it 
is 
more 
reason, 
for 
the 
entertainment 
of 
the 
time, 
that 
ye 
ask 
me 
questions, 
than 
that 
I 
ask 
you.” 
We 
answered, 
that 
we 
humbly 
thanked 
him 
that 
he 
would 
give 
us 
leave 
so 
to 
do. 
And 
that 
we 
conceived 
by 
the 
taste 
we 
had 
already, 
that 
there 
was 
no 
worldly 
thing 
on 
earth 
more 
worthy 
to 
be 
known 
than 
the 
state 
of 
that 
happy 
land. 
But 
above 
all, 
we 
said, 
since 
that 
we 
were 
met 
from 
the 
several 
ends 
of 
the 
world, 
and 
hoped 
assuredly 
that 
we 
should 
meet 
one 
day 
in 
the 
kingdom 
of 
heaven 
(for 
that 
we 
were 
both 
parts 
Christians), 
we 
desired 
to 
know 
(in 
respect 
that 
land 
was 
so 
remote, 
and 
so 
divided 
by 
vast 
and 
unknown 
seas 
from 
the 
land 
where 
our 
Saviour 
walked 
on 
earth) 
who 
was 
the 
apostle 
of 
that 
nation, 
and 
how 
it 
was 
converted 
to 
the 
faith? 
It 
appeared 
in 
his 
face 
that 
he 
took 
great 
contentment 
in 
this 
our 
question; 
he 
said: 
“Ye 
knit 
my 
heart 
to 
you 
by 
asking 
this 
question 
in 
the 
first 



place; 
for 
it 
showeth 
that 
you 
first 
seek 
the 
kingdom 
of 
heaven; 
and 
I 
shall 
gladly, 
and 
briefly, 
satisfy 
your 
demand. 


“About 
twenty 
years 
after 
the 
ascension 
of 
our 
Saviour 
it 
came 
to 
pass, 
that 
there 
was 
seen 
by 
the 
people 
of 
Renfusa 
(a 
city 
upon 
the 
eastern 
coast 
of 
our 
island, 
within 
sight, 
the 
night 
was 
cloudy 
and 
calm), 
as 
it 
might 
be 
some 
mile 
in 
the 
sea, 
a 
great 
pillar 
of 
light; 
not 
sharp, 
but 
in 
form 
of 
a 
column, 
or 
cylinder, 
rising 
from 
the 
sea, 
a 
great 
way 
up 
toward 
heaven; 
and 
on 
the 
top 
of 
it 
was 
seen 
a 
large 
cross 
of 
light, 
more 
bright 
and 
resplendent 
than 
the 
body 
of 
the 
pillar. 
Upon 
which 
so 
strange 
a 
spectacle, 
the 
people 
of 
the 
city 
gathered 
apace 
together 
upon 
the 
sands, 
to 
wonder; 
and 
so 
after 
put 
themselves 
into 
a 
number 
of 
small 
boats 
to 
go 
nearer 
to 
this 
marvellous 
sight. 
But 
when 
the 
boats 
were 
come 
within 
about 
sixty 
yards 
of 
the 
pillar, 
they 
found 
themselves 
all 
bound, 
and 
could 
go 
no 
further, 
yet 
so 
as 
they 
might 
move 
to 
go 
about, 
but 
might 
not 
approach 
nearer; 
so 
as 
the 
boats 
stood 
all 
as 
in 
a 
theatre, 
beholding 
this 
light, 
as 
a 
heavenly 
sign. 
It 
so 
fell 
out 
that 
there 
was 
in 
one 
of 
the 
boats 
one 
of 
the 
wise 
men 
of 
the 
Society 
of 
Saloman’s 
House 
(which 
house, 
or 
college, 
my 
good 
brethren, 
is 
the 
very 
eye 
of 
this 
kingdom), 
who 
having 
awhile 
attentively 
and 
devoutly 
viewed 
and 
contemplated 
this 
pillar 
and 
cross, 
fell 
down 
upon 
his 
face; 
and 
then 
raised 
himself 
upon 
his 
knees, 
and 
lifting 
up 
his 
hands 
to 
heaven, 
made 
his 
prayers 
in 
this 
manner: 


“’Lord 
God 
of 
heaven 
and 
earth; 
thou 
hast 
vouchsafed 
of 
thy 
grace, 
to 
those 
of 
our 
order 
to 
know 
thy 
works 
of 
creation, 
and 
true 
secrets 
of 
them; 
and 
to 
discern, 
as 
far 
as 
appertaineth 
to 
the 
generations 
of 
men, 
between 
divine 
miracles, 
works 
of 
nature, 
works 
of 
art 
and 
impostures, 
and 
illusions 
of 
all 
sorts. 
I 
do 
here 
acknowledge 
and 
testify 
before 
this 
people 
that 
the 
thing 
we 
now 
see 
before 
our 
eyes 
is 
thy 
finger, 
and 
a 
true 
miracle. 
And 
forasmuch 
as 
we 
learn 
in 
our 
books 
that 
thou 
never 
workest 
miracles, 
but 
to 
a 
divine 
and 
excellent 
end 
(for 
the 
laws 
of 
nature 
are 
thine 
own 
laws, 
and 
thou 
exceedest 
them 
not 
but 
upon 
great 
cause), 
we 
most 
humbly 
beseech 
thee 
to 
prosper 
this 
great 
sign, 
and 
to 
give 
us 
the 
interpretation 
and 
use 
of 
it 
in 
mercy; 
which 
thou 
dost 
in 
some 
part 
secretly 
promise, 
by 
sending 
it 
unto 
us.’ 


“When 
he 
had 
made 
his 
prayer, 
he 
presently 
found 
the 
boat 
he 
was 
in 
movable 
and 
unbound; 
whereas 
all 
the 
rest 
remained 
still 
fast; 
and 
taking 
that 
for 
an 
assurance 
of 
leave 
to 
approach, 
he 
caused 
the 
boat 
to 
be 
softly 
and 
with 
silence 
rowed 
toward 
the 
pillar; 
but 
ere 
he 
came 
near 
it, 
the 
pillar 
and 



cross 
of 
light 
broke 
up, 
and 
cast 
itself 
abroad, 
as 
it 
were, 
into 
a 
firmament 
of 
many 
stars, 
which 
also 
vanished 
soon 
after, 
and 
there 
was 
nothing 
left 
to 
be 
seen 
but 
a 
small 
ark 
or 
chest 
of 
cedar, 
dry 
and 
not 
wet 
at 
all 
with 
water, 
though 
it 
swam; 
and 
in 
the 
fore 
end 
of 
it, 
which 
was 
toward 
him, 
grew 
a 
small 
green 
branch 
of 
palm; 
and 
when 
the 
wise 
man 
had 
taken 
it 
with 
all 
reverence 
into 
his 
boat, 
it 
opened 
of 
itself, 
and 
there 
were 
found 
in 
it 
a 
book 
and 
a 
letter, 
both 
written 
in 
fine 
parchment, 
and 
wrapped 
in 
sindons 
of 
linen. 
The 
book 
contained 
all 
the 
canonical 
books 
of 
the 
Old 
and 
New 
Testament, 
according 
as 
you 
have 
them 
(for 
we 
know 
well 
what 
the 
churches 
with 
you 
receive), 
and 
the 
Apocalypse 
itself; 
and 
some 
other 
books 
of 
the 
New 
Testament, 
which 
were 
not 
at 
that 
time 
written, 
were 
nevertheless 
in 
the 
book. 
And 
for 
the 
letter, 
it 
was 
in 
these 
words: 


“’I, 
Bartholomew, 
a 
servant 
of 
the 
Highest, 
and 
apostle 
of 
Jesus 
Christ, 
was 
warned 
by 
an 
angel 
that 
appeared 
to 
me 
in 
a 
vision 
of 
glory, 
that 
I 
should 
commit 
this 
ark 
to 
the 
floods 
of 
the 
sea. 
Therefore 
I 
do 
testify 
and 
declare 
unto 
that 
people 
where 
God 
shall 
ordain 
this 
ark 
to 
come 
to 
land, 
that 
in 
the 
same 
day 
is 
come 
unto 
them 
salvation 
and 
peace, 
and 
good-will 
from 
the 
Father, 
and 
from 
the 
Lord 
Jesus.’ 


“There 
was 
also 
in 
both 
these 
writings, 
as 
well 
the 
book 
as 
the 
letter, 
wrought 
a 
great 
miracle, 
conform 
to 
that 
of 
the 
apostles, 
in 
the 
original 
gift 
of 
tongues. 
For 
there 
being 
at 
that 
time, 
in 
this 
land, 
Hebrews, 
Persians, 
and 
Indians, 
besides 
the 
natives, 
everyone 
read 
upon 
the 
book 
and 
letter, 
as 
if 
they 
had 
been 
written 
in 
his 
own 
language. 
And 
thus 
was 
this 
land 
saved 
from 
infidelity 
(as 
the 
remain 
of 
the 
old 
world 
was 
from 
water) 
by 
an 
ark, 
through 
the 
apostolical 
and 
miraculous 
evangelism 
of 
St. 
Bartholomew.” 
And 
here 
he 
paused, 
and 
a 
mes 
senger 
came 
and 
called 
him 
forth 
from 
us. 
So 
this 
was 
all 
that 
passed 
in 
that 
conference. 


The 
next 
day 
the 
same 
governor 
came 
again 
to 
us 
immediately 
after 
dinner, 
and 
excused 
himself, 
saying 
that 
the 
day 
be 
fore 
he 
was 
called 
from 
us 
somewhat 
abruptly, 
but 
now 
he 
would 
make 
us 
amends, 
and 
spend 
time 
with 
us; 
if 
we 
held 
his 
company 
and 
conference 
agreeable. 
We 
answered 
that 
we 
held 
it 
so 
agreeable 
and 
pleasing 
to 
us, 
as 
we 
forgot 
both 
dangers 
past, 
and 
fears 
to 
come, 
for 
the 
time 
we 
heard 
him 
speak; 
and 
that 
we 
thought 
an 
hour 
spent 
with 
him 
was 
worth 
years 
of 
our 
former 
life. 
He 
bowed 
himself 
a 
little 
to 
us, 
and 
after 
we 
were 
set 
again, 
he 
said, 
“Well, 
the 
questions 
are 
on 
your 
part.” 



One 
of 
our 
number 
said, 
after 
a 
little 
pause, 
that 
there 
was 
a 
matter 
we 
were 
no 
less 
desirous 
to 
know 
than 
fearful 
to 
ask, 
lest 
we 
might 
presume 
too 
far. 
But, 
encouraged 
by 
his 
rare 
humanity 
toward 
us 
(that 
could 
scarce 
think 
ourselves 
strangers, 
being 
his 
vowed 
and 
professed 
servants), 
we 
would 
take 
the 
hardness 
to 
propound 
it; 
humbly 
beseeching 
him, 
if 
he 
thought 
it 
not 
fit 
to 
be 
answered, 
that 
he 
would 
pardon 
it, 
though 
he 
rejected 
it. 
We 
said, 
we 
well 
observed 
those 
his 
words, 
which 
he 
formerly 
spake, 
that 
this 
happy 
island, 
where 
we 
now 
stood, 
was 
known 
to 
few, 
and 
yet 
knew 
most 
of 
the 
nations 
of 
the 
world, 
which 
we 
found 
to 
be 
true, 
considering 
they 
had 
the 
languages 
of 
Europe, 
and 
knew 
much 
of 
our 
State 
and 
business; 
and 
yet 
we 
in 
Europe 
(notwithstanding 
all 
the 
remote 
discoveries 
and 
navigations 
of 
this 
last 
age) 
never 
heard 
any 
of 
the 
least 
inkling 
or 
glimpse 
of 
this 
island. 
This 
we 
found 
wonderful 
strange; 
for 
that 
all 
nations 
have 
interknowledge 
one 
of 
another, 
either 
by 
voyage 
into 
foreign 
parts, 
or 
by 
strangers 
that 
come 
to 
them; 
and 
though 
the 
traveller 
into 
a 
foreign 
country 
doth 
commonly 
know 
more 
by 
the 
eye 
than 
he 
that 
stayeth 
at 
home 
can 
by 
relation 
of 
the 
traveller; 
yet 
both 
ways 
suffice 
to 
make 
a 
mutual 
knowledge, 
in 
some 
degree, 
on 
both 
parts. 
But 
for 
this 
island, 
we 
never 
heard 
tell 
of 
any 
ship 
of 
theirs 
that 
had 
been 
seen 
to 
arrive 
upon 
any 
shore 
of 
Europe; 
no, 
nor 
of 
either 
the 
East 
or 
West 
Indies, 
nor 
yet 
of 
any 
ship 
of 
any 
other 
part 
of 
the 
world, 
that 
had 
made 
return 
for 
them. 
And 
yet 
the 
marvel 
rested 
not 
in 
this. 
For 
the 
situation 
of 
it 
(as 
his 
lordship 
said) 
in 
the 
secret 
conclave 
of 
such 
a 
vast 
sea 
might 
cause 
it. 
But 
then, 
that 
they 
should 
have 
knowledge 
of 
the 
languages, 
books, 
affairs, 
of 
those 
that 
lie 
such 
a 
distance 
from 
them, 
it 
was 
a 
thing 
we 
could 
not 
tell 
what 
to 
make 
of; 
for 
that 
it 
seemed 
to 
us 
a 
condition 
and 
propriety 
of 
divine 
powers 
and 
beings, 
to 
be 
hidden 
and 
unseen 
to 
others, 
and 
yet 
to 
have 
others 
open, 
and 
as 
in 
a 
light 
to 
them. 


At 
this 
speech 
the 
governor 
gave 
a 
gracious 
smile 
and 
said 
that 
we 
did 
well 
to 
ask 
pardon 
for 
this 
question 
we 
now 
asked, 
for 
that 
it 
imported, 
as 
if 
we 
thought 
this 
land 
a 
land 
of 
magicians, 
that 
sent 
forth 
spirits 
of 
the 
air 
into 
all 
parts, 
to 
bring 
them 
news 
and 
intelligence 
of 
other 
countries. 
It 
was 
answered 
by 
us 
all, 
in 
all 
possible 
humbleness, 
but 
yet 
with 
a 
coun 
tenance 
taking 
knowledge, 
that 
we 
knew 
that 
he 
spake 
it 
but 
merrily. 
That 
we 
were 
apt 
enough 
to 
think 
there 
was 
somewhat 
supernatural 
in 
this 
island, 
but 
yet 
rather 
as 
angelical 
than 
magical. 
But 
to 
let 
his 
lordship 
know 
truly 
what 
it 
was 
that 
made 
us 
tender 
and 
doubtful 
to 
ask 
this 
question, 
it 
was 
not 
any 
such 
conceit, 
but 
because 
we 
remembered 
he 
had 
given 
a 
touch 
in 
his 
former 



speech, 
that 
this 
land 
had 
laws 
of 
secrecy 
touching 
strangers. 
To 
this 
he 
said, 
“You 
remember 
it 
aright; 
and 
therefore 
in 
that 
I 
shall 
say 
to 
you, 
I 
must 
reserve 
some 
particulars, 
which 
it 
is 
not 
lawful 
for 
me 
to 
reveal, 
but 
there 
will 
be 
enough 
left 
to 
give 
you 
satisfaction. 


“You 
shall 
understand 
(that 
which 
perhaps 
you 
will 
scarce 
think 
credible) 
that 
about 
3,000 
years 
ago, 
or 
somewhat 
more, 
the 
navigation 
of 
the 
world 
(especially 
for 
remote 
voyages) 
was 
greater 
than 
at 
this 
day. 
Do 
not 
think 
with 
yourselves, 
that 
I 
know 
not 
how 
much 
it 
is 
increased 
with 
you, 
within 
these 
threescore 
years; 
I 
know 
it 
well, 
and 
yet 
I 
say, 
greater 
then 
than 
now; 
whether 
it 
was, 
that 
the 
example 
of 
the 
ark, 
that 
saved 
the 
remnant 
of 
men 
from 
the 
universal 
deluge, 
gave 
men 
confidence 
to 
venture 
upon 
the 
waters, 
or 
what 
it 
was; 
but 
such 
is 
the 
truth. 
The 
Phoenicians, 
and 
especially 
the 
Tyrians, 
had 
great 
fleets; 
so 
had 
the 
Carthaginians 
their 
colony, 
which 
is 
yet 
farther 
west. 
Toward 
the 
east 
the 
shipping 
of 
Egypt, 
and 
of 
Palestine, 
was 
likewise 
great. 
China 
also, 
and 
the 
great 
Atlantis 
(that 
you 
call 
America), 
which 
have 
now 
but 
junks 
and 
canoes, 
abounded 
then 
in 
tall 
ships. 
This 
island 
(as 
appeareth 
by 
faithful 
registers 
of 
those 
times) 
had 
then 
1,500 
strong 
ships, 
of 
great 
content. 
Of 
all 
this 
there 
is 
with 
you 
sparing 
memory, 
or 
none; 
but 
we 
have 
large 
knowledge 
thereof. 


“At 
that 
time 
this 
land 
was 
known 
and 
frequented 
by 
the 
ships 
and 
vessels 
of 
all 
the 
nations 
before 
named. 
And 
(as 
it 
cometh 
to 
pass) 
they 
had 
many 
times 
men 
of 
other 
countries, 
that 
were 
no 
sailors, 
that 
came 
with 
them; 
as 
Persians, 
Chaldeans, 
Arabians, 
so 
as 
almost 
all 
nations 
of 
might 
and 
fame 
re 
sorted 
hither; 
of 
whom 
we 
have 
some 
stirps 
and 
little 
tribes 
with 
us 
at 
this 
day. 
And 
for 
our 
own 
ships, 
they 
went 
sundry 
voyages, 
as 
well 
to 
your 
straits, 
which 
you 
call 
the 
Pillars 
of 
Hercules, 
as 
to 
other 
parts 
in 
the 
Atlantic 
and 
Mediterranean 
seas; 
as 
to 
Paguin 
(which 
is 
the 
same 
with 
Cambalaine) 
and 
Quinzy, 
upon 
the 
Oriental 
seas, 
as 
far 
as 
to 
the 
borders 
of 
the 
East 
Tartary. 


“At 
the 
same 
time, 
and 
an 
age 
after 
or 
more, 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
great 
Atlantis 
did 
flourish. 
For 
though 
the 
narration 
and 
description 
which 
is 
made 
by 
a 
great 
man 
with 
you, 
that 
the 
descendants 
of 
Neptune 
planted 
there, 
and 
of 
the 
magnificent 
temple, 
palace, 
city, 
and 
hill; 
and 
the 
manifold 
streams 
of 
goodly 
navigable 
rivers, 
which 
as 
so 
many 
chains 
environed 
the 
same 
site 
and 
temple; 
and 
the 
several 
degrees 
of 
ascent, 
whereby 
men 
did 
climb 
up 
to 
the 
same, 
as 
if 
it 
had 
been 
a 
Scala 
Coeli; 
be 
all 
poetical 
and 
fabulous; 
yet 
so 
much 
is 
true, 
that 
the 
said 
country 
of 
Atlantis, 
as 
well 
that 
of 
Peru, 
then 
called 



Coya, 
as 
that 
of 
Mexico, 
then 
named 
Tyrambel, 
were 
mighty 
and 
proud 
kingdoms, 
in 
arms, 
shipping, 
and 
riches; 
so 
mighty, 
as 
at 
one 
time, 
or 
at 
least 
within 
the 
space 
of 
ten 
years, 
they 
both 
made 
two 
great 
expeditions; 
they 
of 
Tyrambel 
through 
the 
Atlantic 
to 
the 
Mediterranean 
Sea; 
and 
they 
of 
Coya, 
through 
the 
South 
Sea 
upon 
this 
our 
island; 
and 
for 
the 
former 
of 
these, 
which 
was 
into 
Europe, 
the 
same 
author 
among 
you, 
as 
it 
seemeth, 
had 
some 
relation 
from 
the 
Egyptian 
priest, 
whom 
he 
citeth. 
For 
assuredly, 
such 
a 
thing 
there 
was. 
But 
whether 
it 
were 
the 
ancient 
Athenians 
that 
had 
the 
glory 
of 
the 
repulse 
and 
resistance 
of 
those 
forces, 
I 
can 
say 
nothing; 
but 
certain 
it 
is 
there 
never 
came 
back 
either 
ship 
or 
man 
from 
that 
voyage. 
Neither 
had 
the 
other 
voyage 
of 
those 
of 
Coya 
upon 
us 
had 
better 
fortune, 
if 
they 
had 
not 
met 
with 
enemies 
of 
greater 
clem 
ency. 
For 
the 
King 
of 
this 
island, 
by 
name 
Altabin, 
a 
wise 
man 
and 
a 
great 
warrior, 
knowing 
well 
both 
his 
own 
strength 
and 
that 
of 
his 
enemies, 
handled 
the 
matter 
so 
as 
he 
cut 
off 
their 
land 
forces 
from 
their 
ships, 
and 
entoiled 
both 
their 
navy 
and 
their 
camp 
with 
a 
greater 
power 
than 
theirs, 
both 
by 
sea 
and 
land; 
and 
compelled 
them 
to 
render 
themselves 
without 
striking 
a 
stroke; 
and 
after 
they 
were 
at 
his 
mercy, 
contenting 
himself 
only 
with 
their 
oath, 
that 
they 
should 
no 
more 
bear 
arms 
against 
him, 
dismissed 
them 
all 
in 
safety. 


“But 
the 
divine 
revenge 
overtook 
not 
long 
after 
those 
proud 
enterprises. 
For 
within 
less 
than 
the 
space 
of 
100 
years 
the 
Great 
Atlantis 
was 
utterly 
lost 
and 
destroyed; 
not 
by 
a 
great 
earthquake, 
as 
your 
man 
saith, 
for 
that 
whole 
tract 
is 
little 
subject 
to 
earthquakes, 
but 
by 
a 
particular 
deluge, 
or 
inundation; 
those 
countries 
having 
at 
this 
day 
far 
greater 
rivers, 
and 
far 
higher 
mountains 
to 
pour 
down 
waters, 
than 
any 
part 
of 
the 
old 
world. 
But 
it 
is 
true 
that 
the 
same 
inundation 
was 
not 
deep, 
nor 
past 
forty 
foot, 
in 
most 
places, 
from 
the 
ground, 
so 
that 
although 
it 
destroyed 
man 
and 
beast 
generally, 
yet 
some 
few 
wild 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
wood 
escaped. 
Birds 
also 
were 
saved 
by 
flying 
to 
the 
high 
trees 
and 
woods. 
For 
as 
for 
men, 
although 
they 
had 
buildings 
in 
many 
places 
higher 
than 
the 
depth 
of 
the 
water, 
yet 
that 
inundation, 
though 
it 
were 
shallow, 
had 
a 
long 
continuance, 
whereby 
they 
of 
the 
vale 
that 
were 
not 
drowned 
perished 
for 
want 
of 
food, 
and 
other 
things 
necessary. 
So 
as 
marvel 
you 
not 
at 
the 
thin 
population 
of 
America, 
nor 
at 
the 
rudeness 
and 
ignorance 
of 
the 
people; 
for 
you 
must 
account 
your 
inhabitants 
of 
America 
as 
a 
young 
people, 
younger 
a 
thousand 
years 
at 
the 
least 
than 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
world, 
for 
that 
there 
was 
so 
much 
time 
between 
the 
universal 
flood 
and 
their 
particular 
inundation. 



“For 
the 
poor 
remnant 
of 
human 
seed 
which 
remained 
in 
their 
mountains, 
peopled 
the 
country 
again 
slowly, 
by 
little 
and 
little, 
and 
being 
simple 
and 
a 
savage 
people 
(not 
like 
Noah 
and 
his 
sons, 
which 
was 
the 
chief 
family 
of 
the 
earth), 
they 
were 
not 
able 
to 
leave 
letters, 
arts, 
and 
civility 
to 
their 
posterity; 
and 
having 
likewise 
in 
their 
mountainous 
habitations 
been 
used, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
extreme 
cold 
of 
those 
regions, 
to 
clothe 
themselves 
with 
the 
skins 
of 
tigers, 
bears, 
and 
great 
hairy 
goats, 
that 
they 
have 
in 
those 
parts; 
when 
after 
they 
came 
down 
into 
the 
valley, 
and 
found 
the 
intolerable 
heats 
which 
are 
there, 
and 
knew 
no 
means 
of 
lighter 
apparel, 
they 
were 
forced 
to 
begin 
the 
custom 
of 
going 
naked, 
which 
continueth 
at 
this 
day. 
Only 
they 
take 
great 
pride 
and 
delight 
in 
the 
feathers 
of 
birds, 
and 
this 
also 
they 
took 
from 
those 
their 
ancestors 
of 
the 
mountains, 
who 
were 
invited 
unto 
it, 
by 
the 
infinite 
flight 
of 
birds, 
that 
came 
up 
to 
the 
high 
grounds, 
while 
the 
waters 
stood 
below. 
So 
you 
see, 
by 
this 
main 
accident 
of 
time, 
we 
lost 
our 
traffic 
with 
the 
Americans, 
with 
whom 
of 
all 
others, 
in 
regard 
they 
lay 
nearest 
to 
us, 
we 
had 
most 
commerce. 
As 
for 
the 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
world, 
it 
is 
most 
manifest 
that 
in 
the 
ages 
following 
(whether 
it 
were 
in 
respect 
of 
wars, 
or 
by 
a 
natural 
revolu 
tion 
of 
time) 
navigation 
did 
everywhere 
greatly 
decay, 
and 
specially 
far 
voyages 
(the 
rather 
by 
the 
use 
of 
galleys, 
and 
such 
vessels 
as 
could 
hardly 
brook 
the 
ocean) 
were 
altogether 
left 
and 
omitted. 
So 
then, 
that 
part 
of 
intercourse 
which 
could 
be 
from 
other 
nations 
to 
sail 
to 
us, 
you 
see 
how 
it 
hath 
long 
since 
ceased; 
except 
it 
were 
by 
some 
rare 
accident, 
as 
this 
of 
yours. 
But 
now 
of 
the 
cessation 
of 
that 
other 
part 
of 
intercourse, 
which 
might 
be 
by 
our 
sailing 
to 
other 
nations, 
I 
must 
yield 
you 
some 
other 
cause. 
But 
I 
cannot 
say 
if 
I 
shall 
say 
truly, 
but 
our 
shipping, 
for 
number, 
strength, 
mariners, 
pilots, 
and 
all 
things 
that 
appertain 
to 
navigation, 
is 
as 
great 
as 
ever; 
and 
therefore 
why 
we 
should 
sit 
at 
home, 
I 
shall 
now 
give 
you 
an 
account 
by 
itself; 
and 
it 
will 
draw 
nearer, 
to 
give 
you 
satisfaction, 
to 
your 
principal 
question. 


“There 
reigned 
in 
this 
land, 
about 
1,900 
years 
ago, 
a 
King, 
whose 
memory 
of 
all 
others 
we 
most 
adore; 
not 
superstitiously, 
but 
as 
a 
divine 
instrument, 
though 
a 
mortal 
man: 
his 
name 
was 
Salomana; 
and 
we 
esteem 
him 
as 
the 
lawgiver 
of 
our 
nation. 
This 
King 
had 
a 
large 
heart, 
inscrutable 
for 
good; 
and 
was 
wholly 
bent 
to 
make 
his 
kingdom 
and 
people 
happy. 
He, 
therefore, 
taking 
into 
consideration 
how 
sufficient 
and 
substantive 
this 
land 
was, 
to 
maintain 
itself 
without 
any 
aid 
at 
all 
of 
the 
foreigner; 
being 
5,000 
miles 
in 
circuit, 
and 
of 
rare 
fertility 
of 
soil, 
in 
the 
greatest 
part 
thereof; 
and 



finding 
also 
the 
shipping 
of 
this 
country 
might 
be 
plentifully 
set 
on 
work, 
both 
by 
fishing 
and 
by 
transportations 
from 
port 
to 
port, 
and 
likewise 
by 
sailing 
unto 
some 
small 
islands 
that 
are 
not 
far 
from 
us, 
and 
are 
under 
the 
crown 
and 
laws 
of 
this 
State; 
and 
recalling 
into 
his 
memory 
the 
happy 
and 
flourishing 
estate 
wherein 
this 
land 
then 
was, 
so 
as 
it 
might 
be 
a 
thousand 
ways 
altered 
to 
the 
worse, 
but 
scarce 
any 
one 
way 
to 
the 
better; 
though 
nothing 
wanted 
to 
his 
noble 
and 
heroical 
intentions, 
but 
only 
(as 
far 
as 
human 
foresight 
might 
reach) 
to 
give 
perpetuity 
to 
that 
which 
was 
in 
his 
time 
so 
happily 
established, 
therefore 
among 
his 
other 
fundamental 
laws 
of 
this 
kingdom 
he 
did 
ordain 
the 
interdicts 
and 
prohibitions 
which 
we 
have 
touching 
entrance 
of 
strangers; 
which 
at 
that 
time 
(though 
it 
was 
after 
the 
calamity 
of 
America) 
was 
frequent; 
doubting 
novelties 
and 
commixture 
of 
man 
ners. 
It 
is 
true, 
the 
like 
law 
against 
the 
admission 
of 
strangers 
without 
license 
is 
an 
ancient 
law 
in 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
China, 
and 
yet 
continued 
in 
use. 
But 
there 
it 
is 
a 
poor 
thing; 
and 
hath 
made 
them 
a 
curious, 
ignorant, 
fearful, 
foolish 
nation. 
But 
our 
lawgiver 
made 
his 
law 
of 
another 
temper. 
For 
first, 
he 
hath 
preserved 
all 
points 
of 
humanity, 
in 
taking 
order 
and 
making 
provision 
for 
the 
relief 
of 
strangers 
distressed; 
whereof 
you 
have 
tasted.” 


At 
which 
speech 
(as 
reason 
was) 
we 
all 
rose 
up 
and 
bowed 
ourselves. 
He 
went 
on: 
“That 
King 
also 
still 
desiring 
to 
join 
humanity 
and 
policy 
together; 
and 
thinking 
it 
against 
humanity 
to 
detain 
strangers 
here 
against 
their 
wills, 
and 
against 
policy 
that 
they 
should 
return 
and 
discover 
their 
knowledge 
of 
this 
estate, 
he 
took 
this 
course; 
he 
did 
ordain, 
that 
of 
the 
strangers 
that 
should 
be 
permitted 
to 
land, 
as 
many 
at 
all 
times 
might 
depart 
as 
many 
as 
would; 
but 
as 
many 
as 
would 
stay, 
should 
have 
very 
good 
conditions, 
and 
means 
to 
live 
from 
the 
State. 
Wherein 
he 
saw 
so 
far, 
that 
now 
in 
so 
many 
ages 
since 
the 
prohibition, 
we 
have 
memory 
not 
of 
one 
ship 
that 
ever 
returned, 
and 
but 
of 
thirteen 
persons 
only, 
at 
several 
times, 
that 
chose 
to 
return 
in 
our 
bottoms. 
What 
those 
few 
that 
returned 
may 
have 
reported 
abroad, 
I 
know 
not. 
But 
you 
must 
think, 
whatsoever 
they 
have 
said, 
could 
be 
taken 
where 
they 
came 
but 
for 
a 
dream. 
Now 
for 
our 
travelling 
from 
hence 
into 
parts 
abroad, 
our 
lawgiver 
thought 
fit 
altogether 
to 
restrain 
it. 
So 
is 
it 
not 
in 
China. 
For 
the 
Chinese 
sail 
where 
they 
will, 
or 
can; 
which 
showeth, 
that 
their 
law 
of 
keeping 
out 
strangers 
is 
a 
law 
of 
pusillanimity 
and 
fear. 
But 
this 
restraint 
of 
ours 
hath 
one 
only 
exception, 
which 
is 
admirable; 
preserving 
the 
good 
which 
cometh 
by 
communicating 
with 
strangers, 
and 
avoiding 
the 
hurt: 
and 
I 
will 
now 
open 
it 
to 
you. 



“And 
here 
I 
shall 
seem 
a 
little 
to 
digress, 
but 
you 
will 
by 
and 
by 
find 
it 
pertinent. 
Ye 
shall 
understand, 
my 
dear 
friends, 
that 
among 
the 
excellent 
acts 
of 
that 
King, 
one 
above 
all 
hath 
the 
pre-eminence. 
It 
was 
the 
erection 
and 
institution 
of 
an 
order, 
or 
society, 
which 
we 
call 
Saloman’s 
House, 
the 
noblest 
foundation, 
as 
we 
think, 
that 
ever 
was 
upon 
the 
earth, 
and 
the 
lantern 
of 
this 
kingdom. 
It 
is 
dedicated 
to 
the 
study 
of 
the 
works 
and 
creatures 
of 
God. 
Some 
think 
it 
beareth 
the 
founder’s 
name 
a 
little 
corrupted, 
as 
if 
it 
should 
be 
Solomon’s 
House. 
But 
the 
records 
write 
it 
as 
it 
is 
spoken. 
So 
as 
I 
take 
it 
to 
be 
denominate 
of 
the 
King 
of 
the 
Hebrews, 
which 
is 
famous 
with 
you, 
and 
no 
strangers 
to 
us; 
for 
we 
have 
some 
parts 
of 
his 
works 
which 
with 
you 
are 
lost; 
namely, 
that 
natural 
history 
which 
he 
wrote 
of 
all 
plants, 
from 
the 
cedar 
of 
Libanus 
to 
the 
moss 
that 
groweth 
out 
of 
the 
wall; 
and 
of 
all 
things 
that 
have 
life 
and 
motion. 
This 
maketh 
me 
think 
that 
our 
King 
finding 
himself 
to 
symbolize, 
in 
many 
things, 
with 
that 
King 
of 
the 
Hebrews, 
which 
lived 
many 
years 
before 
him, 
honored 
him 
with 
the 
title 
of 
this 
foundation. 
And 
I 
am 
the 
rather 
induced 
to 
be 
of 
this 
opinion, 
for 
that 
I 
find 
in 
ancient 
records, 
this 
order 
or 
society 
is 
sometimes 
called 
Solomon’s 
House, 
and 
sometimes 
the 
College 
of 
the 
Six 
Days’ 
Works, 
whereby 
I 
am 
satisfied 
that 
our 
excellent 
King 
had 
learned 
from 
the 
Hebrews 
that 
God 
had 
created 
the 
world 
and 
all 
that 
therein 
is 
within 
six 
days: 
and 
therefore 
he 
instituted 
that 
house, 
for 
the 
finding 
out 
of 
the 
true 
nature 
of 
all 
things, 
whereby 
God 
might 
have 
the 
more 
glory 
in 
the 
workmanship 
of 
them, 
and 
men 
the 
more 
fruit 
in 
their 
use 
of 
them, 
did 
give 
it 
also 
that 
second 
name. 


“But 
now 
to 
come 
to 
our 
present 
purpose. 
When 
the 
King 
had 
forbidden 
to 
all 
his 
people 
navigation 
into 
any 
part 
that 
was 
not 
under 
his 
crown, 
he 
made 
nevertheless 
this 
ordinance; 
that 
every 
twelve 
years 
there 
should 
be 
set 
forth 
out 
of 
this 
kingdom, 
two 
ships, 
appointed 
to 
several 
voyages; 
that 
in 
either 
of 
these 
ships 
there 
should 
be 
a 
mission 
of 
three 
of 
the 
fellows 
or 
brethren 
of 
Saloman’s 
House, 
whose 
errand 
was 
only 
to 
give 
us 
knowledge 
of 
the 
affairs 
and 
state 
of 
those 
countries 
to 
which 
they 
were 
designed; 
and 
especially 
of 
the 
sciences, 
arts, 
manufactures, 
and 
inventions 
of 
all 
the 
world; 
and 
withal 
to 
bring 
unto 
us 
books, 
instruments, 
and 
patterns 
in 
every 
kind: 
that 
the 
ships, 
after 
they 
had 
landed 
the 
brethren, 
should 
return; 
and 
that 
the 
brethren 
should 
stay 
abroad 
till 
the 
new 
mis 
sion, 
the 
ships 
are 
not 
otherwise 
fraught 
than 
with 
store 
of 
victuals, 
and 
good 
quantity 
of 
treasure 
to 
remain 
with 
the 
brethren, 
for 
the 
buying 
of 
such 
things, 
and 
rewarding 
of 
such 
persons, 
as 
they 
should 
think 
fit. 
Now 
for 
me 
to 
tell 
you 



how 
the 
vulgar 
sort 
of 
mariners 
are 
contained 
from 
being 
discovered 
at 
land, 
and 
how 
they 
must 
be 
put 
on 
shore 
for 
any 
time, 
color 
themselves 
under 
the 
names 
of 
other 
nations, 
and 
to 
what 
places 
these 
voyages 
have 
been 
designed; 
and 
what 
places 
of 
rendezvous 
are 
appointed 
for 
the 
new 
missions, 
and 
the 
like 
circum 
stances 
of 
the 
practice, 
I 
may 
not 
do 
it, 
neither 
is 
it 
much 
to 
your 
desire. 
But 
thus 
you 
see 
we 
maintain 
a 
trade, 
not 
for 
gold, 
silver, 
or 
jewels, 
nor 
for 
silks, 
nor 
for 
spices, 
nor 
any 
other 
commodity 
of 
matter; 
but 
only 
for 
God’s 
first 
creature, 
which 
was 
light; 
to 
have 
light, 
I 
say, 
of 
the 
growth 
of 
all 
parts 
of 
the 
world.” 


And 
when 
he 
had 
said 
this, 
he 
was 
silent, 
and 
so 
were 
we 
all; 
for 
indeed 
we 
were 
all 
astonished 
to 
hear 
so 
strange 
things 
so 
probably 
told. 
And 
he 
perceiving 
that 
we 
were 
willing 
to 
say 
somewhat, 
but 
had 
it 
not 
ready, 
in 
great 
courtesy 
took 
us 
off, 
and 
descended 
to 
ask 
us 
questions 
of 
our 
voyage 
and 
fortunes, 
and 
in 
the 
end 
concluded 
that 
we 
might 
do 
well 
to 
think 
with 
ourselves 
what 
time 
of 
stay 
we 
would 
demand 
of 
the 
State, 
and 
bade 
us 
not 
to 
scant 
ourselves; 
for 
he 
would 
procure 
such 
time 
as 
we 
desired. 
Whereupon 
we 
all 
rose 
up 
and 
presented 
ourselves 
to 
kiss 
the 
skirt 
of 
his 
tippet, 
but 
he 
would 
not 
suffer 
us, 
and 
so 
took 
his 
leave. 
But 
when 
it 
came 
once 
among 
our 
people 
that 
the 
State 
used 
to 
offer 
conditions 
to 
strangers 
that 
would 
stay, 
we 
had 
work 
enough 
to 
get 
any 
of 
our 
men 
to 
look 
to 
our 
ship, 
and 
to 
keep 
them 
from 
going 
presently 
to 
the 
governor 
to 
crave 
conditions; 
but 
with 
much 
ado 
we 
restrained 
them, 
till 
we 
might 
agree 
what 
course 
to 
take. 


We 
took 
ourselves 
now 
for 
freemen, 
seeing 
there 
was 
no 
danger 
of 
our 
utter 
perdition, 
and 
lived 
most 
joyfully, 
going 
abroad 
and 
seeing 
what 
was 
to 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
city 
and 
places 
adjacent, 
within 
our 
tedder; 
and 
obtaining 
acquaintance 
with 
many 
of 
the 
city, 
not 
of 
the 
meanest 
quality, 
at 
whose 
hands 
we 
found 
such 
humanity, 
and 
such 
a 
freedom 
and 
desire 
to 
take 
strangers, 
as 
it 
were, 
into 
their 
bosom, 
as 
was 
enough 
to 
make 
us 
forget 
all 
that 
was 
dear 
to 
us 
in 
our 
own 
countries, 
and 
continually 
we 
met 
with 
many 
things, 
right 
worthy 
of 
observation 
and 
relation; 
as 
indeed, 
if 
there 
be 
a 
mirror 
in 
the 
world, 
worthy 
to 
hold 
men’s 
eyes, 
it 
is 
that 
country. 
One 
day 
there 
were 
two 
of 
our 
company 
bidden 
to 
a 
feast 
of 
the 
family, 
as 
they 
call 
it; 
a 
most 
natural, 
pious, 
and 
reverend 
custom 
it 
is, 
showing 
that 
nation 
to 
be 
compounded 
of 
all 
goodness. 
This 
is 
the 
manner 
of 
it; 
it 
is 
granted 
to 
any 
man 
that 
shall 
live 
to 
see 
thirty 
persons 
descended 
of 
his 
body, 
alive 
together, 
and 
all 
above 
three 
years 
old, 
to 
make 
this 
feast, 
which 
is 
done 
at 
the 
cost 
of 



the 
State. 
The 
father 
of 
the 
family, 
whom 
they 
call 
the 
tirsan, 
two 
days 
before 
the 
feast, 
taketh 
to 
him 
three 
of 
such 
friends 
as 
he 
liketh 
to 
choose, 
and 
is 
assisted 
also 
by 
the 
governor 
of 
the 
city 
or 
place 
where 
the 
feast 
is 
celebrated; 
and 
all 
the 
persons 
of 
the 
family, 
of 
both 
sexes, 
are 
summoned 
to 
attend 
him. 
These 
two 
days 
the 
tirsan 
sitteth 
in 
consultation, 
concerning 
the 
good 
estate 
of 
the 
family. 
There, 
if 
there 
be 
any 
discord 
or 
suits 
between 
any 
of 
the 
family, 
they 
are 
compounded 
and 
appeased. 
There, 
if 
any 
of 
the 
family 
be 
distressed 
or 
decayed, 
order 
is 
taken 
for 
their 
relief, 
and 
competent 
means 
to 
live. 
There, 
if 
any 
be 
subject 
to 
vice, 
or 
take 
ill-courses, 
they 
are 
reproved 
and 
censured. 
So, 
likewise, 
direction 
is 
given 
touching 
marriages, 
and 
the 
courses 
of 
life 
which 
any 
of 
them 
should 
take, 
with 
divers 
other 
the 
like 
orders 
and 
advices. 
The 
governor 
sitteth 
to 
the 
end, 
to 
put 
in 
execution, 
by 
his 
public 
au 
thority, 
the 
decrees 
and 
orders 
of 
the 
tirsan, 
if 
they 
should 
be 
disobeyed, 
though 
that 
seldom 
needeth; 
such 
reverence 
and 
obedience 
they 
give 
to 
the 
order 
of 
nature. 


The 
tirsan 
doth 
also 
then 
ever 
choose 
one 
man 
from 
among 
his 
sons, 
to 
live 
in 
house 
with 
him, 
who 
is 
called 
ever 
after 
the 
Son 
of 
the 
Vine. 
The 
reason 
will 
hereafter 
appear. 
On 
the 
feast 
day, 
the 
father, 
or 
tirsan, 
cometh 
forth 
after 
divine 
service 
into 
a 
large 
room 
where 
the 
feast 
is 
celebrated; 
which 
room 
hath 
a 
half-pace 
at 
the 
upper 
end. 
Against 
the 
wall, 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
half-pace, 
is 
a 
chair 
placed 
for 
him, 
with 
a 
table 
and 
carpet 
before 
it. 
Over 
the 
chair 
is 
a 
state, 
made 
round 
or 
oval 
and 
it 
is 
of 
ivy; 
an 
ivy 
somewhat 
whiter 
than 
ours, 
like 
the 
leaf 
of 
a 
silver-asp, 
but 
more 
shining; 
for 
it 
is 
green 
all 
winter. 
And 
the 
state 
is 
curiously 
wrought 
with 
silver 
and 
silk 
of 
divers 
colors, 
broiding 
or 
binding 
in 
the 
ivy; 
and 
is 
ever 
of 
the 
work 
of 
some 
of 
the 
daughters 
of 
the 
family, 
and 
veiled 
over 
at 
the 
top, 
with 
a 
fine 
net 
of 
silk 
and 
silver. 
But 
the 
substance 
of 
it 
is 
true 
ivy; 
whereof 
after 
it 
is 
taken 
down, 
the 
friends 
of 
the 
family 
are 
desirous 
to 
have 
some 
leaf 
or 
sprig 
to 
keep. 
The 
tirsan 
cometh 
forth 
with 
all 
his 
generation 
or 
lineage, 
the 
males 
before 
him, 
and 
the 
females 
following 
him; 
and 
if 
there 
be 
a 
mother, 
from 
whose 
body 
the 
whole 
lineage 
is 
descended, 
there 
is 
a 
traverse 
placed 
in 
a 
loft 
above 
on 
the 
right 
hand 
of 
the 
chair, 
with 
a 
privy 
door, 
and 
a 
carved 
window 
of 
glass, 
leaded 
with 
gold 
and 
blue; 
where 
she 
sitteth, 
but 
is 
not 
seen. 


When 
the 
tirsan 
is 
come 
forth, 
he 
sitteth 
down 
in 
the 
chair; 
and 
all 
the 
lineage 
place 
themselves 
against 
the 
wall, 
both 
at 
his 
back, 
and 
upon 
the 
return 
of 
the 
half-pace, 
in 
order 
of 
their 
years) 
without 
difference 
of 
sex, 
and 



stand 
upon 
their 
feet. 
When 
he 
is 
set, 
the 
room 
being 
always 
full 
of 
company, 
but 
well 
kept 
and 
without 
disorder, 
after 
some 
pause 
there 
cometh 
in 
from 
the 
lower 
end 
of 
the 
room 
a 
taratan 
(which 
is 
as 
much 
as 
a 
herald), 
and 
on 
either 
side 
of 
him 
two 
young 
lads: 
whereof 
one 
carrieth 
a 
scroll 
of 
their 
shining 
yellow 
parchment, 
and 
the 
other 
a 
cluster 
of 
grapes 
of 
gold, 
with 
a 
long 
foot 
or 
stalk. 
The 
herald 
and 
children 
are 
clothed 
with 
mantles 
of 
sea-watergreen 
satin; 
but 
the 
herald’s 
mantle 
is 
streamed 
with 
gold, 
and 
hath 
a 
train. 
Then 
the 
herald 
with 
three 
courtesies, 
or 
rather 
inclinations, 
cometh 
up 
as 
far 
as 
the 
half-pace, 
and 
there 
first 
taketh 
into 
his 
hand 
the 
scroll. 
This 
scroll 
is 
the 
King’s 
charter, 
containing 
gift 
of 
revenue, 
and 
many 
privileges, 
exemp 
tions, 
and 
points 
of 
honor, 
granted 
to 
the 
father 
of 
the 
family; 
and 
it 
is 
ever 
styled 
and 
directed, 
“To 
such 
an 
one, 
our 
wellbeloved 
friend 
and 
creditor,” 
which 
is 
a 
title 
proper 
only 
to 
this 
case. 
For 
they 
say, 
the 
King 
is 
debtor 
to 
no 
man, 
but 
for 
propagation 
of 
his 
subjects; 
the 
seal 
set 
to 
the 
King’s 
charter 
is 
the 
King’s 
image, 
embossed 
or 
moulded 
in 
gold; 
and 
though 
such 
charters 
be 
expedited 
of 
course, 
and 
as 
of 
right, 
yet 
they 
are 
varied 
by 
discretion, 
according 
to 
the 
number 
and 
dignity 
of 
the 
family. 
This 
charter 
the 
herald 
readeth 
aloud; 
and 
while 
it 
is 
read, 
the 
father, 
or 
tirsan, 
standeth 
up, 
supported 
by 
two 
of 
his 
sons, 
such 
as 
he 
chooseth. 


Then 
the 
herald 
mounteth 
the 
half-pace, 
and 
delivereth 
the 
charter 
into 
his 
hand: 
and 
with 
that 
there 
is 
an 
acclamation, 
by 
all 
that 
are 
present, 
in 
their 
language, 
which 
is 
thus 
much, 
“Happy 
are 
the 
people 
of 
Bensalem.” 
Then 
the 
herald 
taketh 
into 
his 
hand 
from 
the 
other 
child 
the 
cluster 
of 
grapes, 
which 
is 
of 
gold; 
both 
the 
stalk, 
and 
the 
grapes. 
But 
the 
grapes 
are 
daintily 
enamelled: 
and 
if 
the 
males 
of 
the 
family 
be 
the 
greater 
number, 
the 
grapes 
are 
enamelled 
purple, 
with 
a 
little 
sun 
set 
on 
the 
top; 
if 
the 
females, 
then 
they 
are 
enamelled 
into 
a 
greenish 
yellow, 
with 
a 
crescent 
on 
the 
top. 
The 
grapes 
are 
in 
num 
ber 
as 
many 
as 
there 
are 
descendants 
of 
the 
family. 
This 
golden 
cluster 
the 
herald 
delivereth 
also 
to 
the 
tirsan; 
who 
presently 
delivereth 
it 
over 
to 
that 
son 
that 
he 
had 
formerly 
chosen, 
to 
be 
in 
house 
with 
him: 
who 
beareth 
it 
before 
his 
father, 
as 
an 
ensign 
of 
honor, 
when 
he 
goeth 
in 
public 
ever 
after; 
and 
is 
thereupon 
called 
the 
Son 
of 
the 
Vine. 
After 
this 
ceremony 
ended 
the 
father, 
or 
tirsan, 
retireth, 
and 
after 
some 
time 
cometh 
forth 
again 
to 
dinner, 
where 
he 
sitteth 
alone 
under 
the 
state, 
as 
before; 
and 
none 
of 
his 
descendants 
sit 
with 
him, 
of 
what 
degree 
or 
dignity 
so 
ever, 
except 
he 
hap 
to 
be 
of 
Saloman’s 
House. 
He 
is 
served 
only 
by 
his 
own 
children, 
such 
as 
are 
male; 
who 
perform 
unto 
him 
all 
service 
of 
the 
table 
upon 
the 
knee, 
and 
the 
women 



only 
stand 
about 
him, 
leaning 
against 
the 
wall. 
The 
room 
below 
his 
half-pace 
hath 
tables 
on 
the 
sides 
for 
the 
guests 
that 
are 
bidden; 
who 
are 
served 
with 
great 
and 
comely 
order; 
and 
toward 
the 
end 
of 
dinner 
(which 
in 
the 
greatest 
feasts 
with 
them 
lasteth 
never 
above 
an 
hour 
and 
a 
half) 
there 
is 
a 
hymn 
sung, 
varied 
according 
to 
the 
invention 
of 
him 
that 
composeth 
it 
(for 
they 
have 
excellent 
poesy), 
but 
the 
subject 
of 
it 
is 
always 
the 
praises 
of 
Adam, 
and 
Noah, 
and 
Abraham; 
whereof 
the 
former 
two 
peopled 
the 
world, 
and 
the 
last 
was 
the 
father 
of 
the 
faithful: 
concluding 
ever 
with 
a 
thanksgiving 
for 
the 
nativity 
of 
our 
Saviour, 
in 
whose 
birth 
the 
births 
of 
all 
are 
only 
blessed. 


Dinner 
being 
done, 
the 
tirsan 
retireth 
again; 
and 
having 
withdrawn 
himself 
alone 
into 
a 
place, 
where 
he 
maketh 
some 
private 
prayers, 
he 
cometh 
forth 
the 
third 
time, 
to 
give 
the 
blessing; 
with 
all 
his 
descendants, 
who 
stand 
about 
him 
as 
at 
the 
first. 
Then 
he 
calleth 
them 
forth 
by 
one 
and 
by 
one, 
by 
name 
as 
he 
pleaseth, 
though 
seldom 
the 
order 
of 
age 
be 
inverted. 
The 
person 
that 
is 
called 
(the 
table 
being 
before 
removed) 
kneeleth 
down 
before 
the 
chair, 
and 
the 
father 
layeth 
his 
hand 
upon 
his 
head, 
or 
her 
head, 
and 
giveth 
the 
blessing 
in 
these 
words: 
“Son 
of 
Bensalem 
(or 
daughter 
of 
Bensalem), 
thy 
father 
saith 
it; 
the 
man 
by 
whom 
thou 
hast 
breath 
and 
life 
speaketh 
the 
word; 
the 
blessing 
of 
the 
everlasting 
Father, 
the 
Prince 
of 
Peace, 
and 
the 
Holy 
Dove 
be 
upon 
thee, 
and 
make 
the 
days 
of 
thy 
pilgrimage 
good 
and 
many.” 
This 
he 
saith 
to 
every 
of 
them; 
and 
that 
done, 
if 
there 
be 
any 
of 
his 
sons 
of 
eminent 
merit 
and 
virtue, 
so 
they 
be 
not 
above 
two, 
he 
calleth 
for 
them 
again, 
and 
saith, 
laying 
his 
arm 
over 
their 
shoulders, 
they 
standing: 
“Sons, 
it 
is 
well 
you 
are 
born, 
give 
God 
the 
praise, 
and 
persevere 
to 
the 
end;” 
and 
withal 
delivereth 
to 
either 
of 
them 
a 
jewel, 
made 
in 
the 
figure 
of 
an 
ear 
of 
wheat, 
which 
they 
ever 
after 
wear 
in 
the 
front 
of 
their 
turban, 
or 
hat; 
this 
done, 
they 
fall 
to 
music 
and 
dances, 
and 
other 
recreations, 
after 
their 
manner, 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
day. 
This 
is 
the 
full 
order 
of 
that 
feast. 


By 
that 
time 
six 
or 
seven 
days 
were 
spent, 
I 
was 
fallen 
into 
straight 
acquaintance 
with 
a 
merchant 
of 
that 
city, 
whose 
name 
was 
Joabin. 
He 
was 
a 
Jew 
and 
circumcised; 
for 
they 
have 
some 
few 
stirps 
of 
Jews 
yet 
remaining 
among 
them, 
whom 
they 
leave 
to 
their 
own 
religion. 
Which 
they 
may 
the 
better 
do, 
because 
they 
are 
of 
a 
far 
differing 
disposition 
from 
the 
Jews 
in 
other 
parts. 
For 
whereas 
they 
hate 
the 
name 
of 
Christ, 
and 
have 
a 
secret 
inbred 
rancor 
against 
the 
people 
among 
whom 
they 
live; 
these, 
contrariwise, 
give 
unto 
our 
Saviour 
many 
high 
attributes, 
and 
love 
the 
nation 
of 
Bensalem 



extremely. 
Surely 
this 
man 
of 
whom 
I 
speak 
would 
ever 
acknowledge 
that 
Christ 
was 
born 
of 
a 
Virgin; 
and 
that 
he 
was 
more 
than 
a 
man; 
and 
he 
would 
tell 
how 
God 
made 
him 
ruler 
of 
the 
seraphim, 
which 
guard 
his 
throne; 
and 
they 
call 
him 
also 
the 
Milken 
Way, 
and 
the 
Eliah 
of 
the 
Messiah, 
and 
many 
other 
high 
names, 
which 
though 
they 
be 
inferior 
to 
his 
divine 
majesty, 
yet 
they 
are 
far 
from 
the 
language 
of 
other 
Jews. 
And 
for 
the 
country 
of 
Bensalem, 
this 
man 
would 
make 
no 
end 
of 
commending 
it, 
being 
desirous 
by 
tradition 
among 
the 
Jews 
there 
to 
have 
it 
believed 
that 
the 
people 
thereof 
were 
of 
the 
generations 
of 
Abraham, 
by 
another 
son, 
whom 
they 
call 
Nachoran; 
and 
that 
Moses 
by 
a 
secret 
cabala 
ordained 
the 
laws 
of 
Bensalem 
which 
they 
now 
use; 
and 
that 
when 
the 
Messias 
should 
come, 
and 
sit 
in 
his 
throne 
at 
Hierusalem, 
the 
King 
of 
Bensalem 
should 
sit 
at 
his 
feet, 
whereas 
other 
kings 
should 
keep 
a 
great 
distance. 
But 
yet 
setting 
aside 
these 
Jewish 
dreams, 
the 
man 
was 
a 
wise 
man 
and 
learned, 
and 
of 
great 
policy, 
and 
excellently 
seen 
in 
the 
laws 
and 
customs 
of 
that 
nation. 


Among 
other 
discourses 
one 
day 
I 
told 
him, 
I 
was 
much 
affected 
with 
the 
relation 
I 
had 
from 
some 
of 
the 
company 
of 
their 
custom 
in 
holding 
the 
feast 
of 
the 
family, 
for 
that, 
methought, 
I 
had 
never 
heard 
of 
a 
solemnity 
wherein 
nature 
did 
so 
much 
preside. 
And 
because 
propagation 
of 
families 
proceedeth 
from 
the 
nuptial 
copulation, 
I 
desired 
to 
know 
of 
him 
what 
laws 
and 
customs 
they 
had 
concerning 
marriage, 
and 
whether 
they 
kept 
marriage 
well, 
and 
whether 
they 
were 
tied 
to 
one 
wife? 
For 
that 
where 
population 
is 
so 
much 
affected, 
and 
such 
as 
with 
them 
it 
seemed 
to 
be, 
there 
is 
commonly 
permission 
of 
plurality 
of 
wives. 
To 
this 
he 
said: 


“You 
have 
reason 
for 
to 
commend 
that 
excellent 
institution 
of 
the 
feast 
of 
the 
family; 
and 
indeed 
we 
have 
experience, 
that 
those 
families 
that 
are 
partakers 
of 
the 
blessings 
of 
that 
feast, 
do 
flourish 
and 
prosper 
ever 
after, 
in 
an 
extraordinary 
manner. 
But 
hear 
me 
now, 
and 
I 
will 
tell 
you 
what 
I 
know. 
You 
shall 
understand 
that 
there 
is 
not 
under 
the 
heavens 
so 
chaste 
a 
nation 
as 
this 
of 
Bensalem, 
nor 
so 
free 
from 
all 
pollution 
or 
foulness. 
It 
is 
the 
virgin 
of 
the 
world; 
I 
remember, 
I 
have 
read 
in 
one 
of 
your 
European 
books, 
of 
a 
holy 
hermit 
among 
you, 
that 
desired 
to 
see 
the 
spirit 
of 
fornication, 
and 
there 
appeared 
to 
him 
a 
little 
foul 
ugly 
Ethiope; 
but 
if 
he 
had 
desired 
to 
see 
the 
spirit 
of 
chastity 
of 
Bensalem, 
it 
would 
have 
appeared 
to 
him 
in 
the 
likeness 
of 
a 
fair 
beautiful 
cherub. 
For 
there 
is 
nothing, 
among 
mortal 
men, 
more 
fair 
and 
admirable 
than 
the 
chaste 
minds 
of 
this 
people. 



“Know, 
therefore, 
that 
with 
them 
there 
are 
no 
stews, 
no 
dissolute 
houses, 
no 
courtesans, 
nor 
anything 
of 
that 
kind. 
Nay, 
they 
wonder, 
with 
detestation, 
at 
you 
in 
Europe, 
which 
permit 
such 
things. 
They 
say 
ye 
have 
put 
marriage 
out 
of 
office; 
for 
marriage 
is 
ordained 
a 
remedy 
for 
unlawful 
concupiscence; 
and 
natural 
concupiscence 
seemeth 
as 
a 
spur 
to 
marriage. 
But 
when 
men 
have 
at 
hand 
a 
remedy, 
more 
agreeable 
to 
their 
corrupt 
will, 
marriage 
is 
almost 
expulsed. 
And 
therefore 
there 
are 
with 
you 
seen 
infinite 
men 
that 
marry 
not, 
but 
choose 
rather 
a 
libertine 
and 
impure 
single 
life, 
than 
to 
be 
yoked 
in 
marriage; 
and 
many 
that 
do 
marry, 
marry 
late, 
when 
the 
prime 
and 
strength 
of 
their 
years 
are 
past. 
And 
when 
they 
do 
marry, 
what 
is 
marriage 
to 
them 
but 
a 
very 
bargain; 
wherein 
is 
sought 
alliance, 
or 
portion, 
or 
reputation, 
with 
some 
desire 
(almost 
indifferent) 
of 
issue; 
and 
not 
the 
faithful 
nuptial 
union 
of 
man 
and 
wife, 
that 
was 
first 
instituted. 
Neither 
is 
it 
possible 
that 
those 
that 
have 
cast 
away 
so 
basely 
so 
much 
of 
their 
strength, 
should 
greatly 
esteem 
children 
(being 
of 
the 
same 
matter) 
as 
chaste 
men 
do. 
So 
likewise 
during 
marriage 
is 
the 
case 
much 
amended, 
as 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
if 
those 
things 
were 
tolerated 
only 
for 
necessity; 
no, 
but 
they 
remain 
still 
as 
a 
very 
affront 
to 
marriage. 


“The 
haunting 
of 
those 
dissolute 
places, 
or 
resort 
to 
courtesans, 
are 
no 
more 
punished 
in 
married 
men 
than 
in 
bachelors. 
And 
the 
depraved 
custom 
of 
change, 
and 
the 
delight 
in 
meretricious 
embracements 
(where 
sin 
is 
turned 
into 
art), 
maketh 
marriage 
a 
dull 
thing, 
and 
a 
kind 
of 
imposition 
or 
tax. 
They 
hear 
you 
defend 
these 
things, 
as 
done 
to 
avoid 
greater 
evils; 
as 
advoutries, 
deflowering 
of 
virgins, 
unnatural 
lust, 
and 
the 
like. 
But 
they 
say 
this 
is 
a 
preposterous 
wisdom; 
and 
they 
call 
it 
Lot’s 
offer, 
who 
to 
save 
his 
guests 
from 
abusing, 
offered 
his 
daughters; 
nay, 
they 
say 
further, 
that 
there 
is 
little 
gained 
in 
this; 
for 
that 
the 
same 
vices 
and 
appetites 
do 
still 
remain 
and 
abound, 
unlawful 
lust 
being 
like 
a 
furnace, 
that 
if 
you 
stop 
the 
flames 
altogether 
it 
will 
quench, 
but 
if 
you 
give 
it 
any 
vent 
it 
will 
rage; 
as 
for 
masculine 
love, 
they 
have 
no 
touch 
of 
it; 
and 
yet 
there 
are 
not 
so 
faithful 
and 
inviolate 
friendships 
in 
the 
world 
again 
as 
are 
there, 
and 
to 
speak 
generally 
(as 
I 
said 
before) 
I 
have 
not 
read 
of 
any 
such 
chastity 
in 
any 
people 
as 
theirs. 
And 
their 
usual 
saying 
is 
that 
whosoever 
is 
unchaste 
cannot 
reverence 
himself; 
and 
they 
say 
that 
the 
reverence 
of 
a 
man’s 
self, 
is, 
next 
religion, 
the 
chiefest 
bridle 
of 
all 
vices.” 


And 
when 
he 
had 
said 
this 
the 
good 
Jew 
paused 
a 
little; 
whereupon 



I, 
far 
more 
willing 
to 
hear 
him 
speak 
on 
than 
to 
speak 
myself; 
yet 
thinking 
it 
decent 
that 
upon 
his 
pause 
of 
speech 
I 
should 
not 
be 
altogether 
silent, 
said 
only 
this; 
that 
I 
would 
say 
to 
him, 
as 
the 
widow 
of 
Sarepta 
said 
to 
Elias: 
“that 
he 
was 
come 
to 
bring 
to 
memory 
our 
sins; 
“and 
that 
I 
confess 
the 
righteousness 
of 
Bensalem 
was 
greater 
than 
the 
righteousness 
of 
Europe. 
At 
which 
speech 
he 
bowed 
his 
head, 
and 
went 
on 
this 
manner: 


“They 
have 
also 
many 
wise 
and 
excellent 
laws, 
touching 
marriage. 
They 
allow 
no 
polygamy. 
They 
have 
ordained 
that 
none 
do 
intermarry, 
or 
contract, 
until 
a 
month 
be 
past 
from 
their 
first 
interview. 
Marriage 
without 
consent 
of 
parents 
they 
do 
not 
make 
void, 
but 
they 
mulct 
it 
in 
the 
inheritors; 
for 
the 
children 
of 
such 
marriages 
are 
not 
admitted 
to 
inherit 
above 
a 
third 
part 
of 
their 
parents’ 
inheritance. 
I 
have 
read 
in 
a 
book 
of 
one 
of 
your 
men, 
of 
a 
feigned 
commonwealth, 
where 
the 
married 
couple 
are 
permitted, 
before 
they 
contract, 
to 
see 
one 
another 
naked. 
This 
they 
dislike; 
for 
they 
think 
it 
a 
scorn 
to 
give 
a 
refusal 
after 
so 
familiar 
knowledge; 
but 
because 
of 
many 
hidden 
defects 
in 
men 
and 
women’s 
bodies, 
they 
have 
a 
more 
civil 
way; 
for 
they 
have 
near 
every 
town 
a 
couple 
of 
pools 
(which 
they 
call 
Adam 
and 
Eve’s 
pools), 
where 
it 
is 
permitted 
to 
one 
of 
the 
friends 
of 
the 
man, 
and 
another 
of 
the 
friends 
of 
the 
woman, 
to 
see 
them 
severally 
bathe 
naked.” 


And 
as 
we 
were 
thus 
in 
conference, 
there 
came 
one 
that 
seemed 
to 
be 
a 
messenger, 
in 
a 
rich 
huke, 
that 
spake 
with 
the 
Jew; 
whereupon 
he 
turned 
to 
me, 
and 
said, 
“You 
will 
pardon 
me, 
for 
I 
am 
commanded 
away 
in 
haste.” 
The 
next 
morning 
he 
came 
to 
me 
again, 
joyful 
as 
it 
seemed, 
and 
said: 
“There 
is 
word 
come 
to 
the 
governor 
of 
the 
city, 
that 
one 
of 
the 
fathers 
of 
Salomon’s 
House 
will 
be 
here 
this 
day 
seven-night; 
we 
have 
seen 
none 
of 
them 
this 
dozen 
years. 
His 
coming 
is 
in 
state; 
but 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
coming 
is 
secret. 
I 
will 
provide 
you 
and 
your 
fellows 
of 
a 
good 
standing 
to 
see 
his 
entry.” 
I 
thanked 
him, 
and 
told 
him 
I 
was 
most 
glad 
of 
the 
news. 


The 
day 
being 
come 
he 
made 
his 
entry. 
He 
was 
a 
man 
of 
middle 
stature 
and 
age, 
comely 
of 
person, 
and 
had 
an 
aspect 
as 
if 
he 
pitied 
men. 
He 
was 
clothed 
in 
a 
robe 
of 
fine 
black 
cloth 
and 
wide 
sleeves, 
and 
a 
cape: 
his 
under-garment 
was 
of 
excellent 
white 
linen 
down 
to 
the 
foot, 
girt 
with 
a 
girdle 
of 
the 
same; 
and 
a 
sindon 
or 
tippet 
of 
the 
same 
about 
his 
neck. 
He 
had 
gloves 
that 
were 
curious, 
and 
set 
with 
stone; 
and 
shoes 
of 
peach-colored 
velvet. 
His 
neck 
was 
bare 
to 
the 
shoulders. 
His 
hat 
was 
like 
a 
helmet, 
or 
Spanish 
montero; 
and 
his 
locks 
curled 
below 
it 
decently; 
they 
were 
of 
color 



brown. 
His 
heard 
was 
cut 
round 
and 
of 
the 
same 
color 
with 
his 
hair, 
somewhat 
lighter. 
He 
was 
carried 
in 
a 
rich 
chariot, 
without 
wheels, 
litter-
wise, 
with 
two 
horses 
at 
either 
end, 
richly 
trapped 
in 
blue 
velvet 
embroidered; 
and 
two 
footmen 
on 
each 
side 
in 
the 
like 
attire. 
The 
chariot 
was 
all 
of 
cedar, 
gilt 
and 
adorned 
with 
crystal; 
save 
that 
the 
fore 
end 
had 
panels 
of 
sapphires 
set 
in 
borders 
of 
gold, 
and 
the 
hinder 
end 
the 
like 
of 
emeralds 
of 
the 
Peru 
color. 
There 
was 
also 
a 
sun 
of 
gold, 
radiant 
upon 
the 
top, 
in 
the 
midst; 
and 
on 
the 
top 
before 
a 
small 
cherub 
of 
gold, 
with 
wings 
displayed. 
The 
chariot 
was 
covered 
with 
cloth-ofgold 
tissued 
upon 
blue. 
He 
had 
before 
him 
fifty 
attendants, 
young 
men 
all, 
in 
white 
satin 
loose 
coats 
up 
to 
the 
mid-leg, 
and 
stockings 
of 
white 
silk; 
and 
shoes 
of 
blue 
velvet; 
and 
hats 
of 
blue 
velvet, 
with 
fine 
plumes 
of 
divers 
colors, 
set 
round 
like 
hat-bands. 
Next 
before 
the 
chariot 
went 
two 
men, 
bareheaded, 
in 
linen 
garments 
down 
to 
the 
foot, 
girt, 
and 
shoes 
of 
blue 
velvet, 
who 
carried 
the 
one 
a 
crosier, 
the 
other 
a 
pastoral 
staff 
like 
a 
sheep-hook; 
neither 
of 
them 
of 
metal, 
but 
the 
crosier 
of 
balm-
wood, 
the 
pastoral 
staff 
of 
cedar. 
Horsemen 
he 
had 
none, 
neither 
before 
nor 
behind 
his 
chariot; 
as 
it 
seemeth, 
to 
avoid 
all 
tumult 
and 
trouble. 
Behind 
his 
chariot 
went 
all 
the 
officers 
and 
principals 
of 
the 
companies 
of 
the 
city. 
He 
sat 
alone, 
upon 
cushions, 
of 
a 
kind 
of 
excellent 
plush, 
blue; 
and 
under 
his 
foot 
curious 
carpets 
of 
silk 
of 
divers 
colors, 
like 
the 
Persian, 
but 
far 
finer. 
He 
held 
up 
his 
bare 
hand, 
as 
he 
went, 
as 
blessing 
the 
people, 
but 
in 
silence. 
The 
street 
was 
wonderfully 
well 
kept; 
so 
that 
there 
was 
never 
any 
army 
had 
their 
men 
stand 
in 
better 
battle-array 
than 
the 
people 
stood. 
The 
windows 
likewise 
were 
not 
crowded, 
but 
everyone 
stood 
in 
them, 
as 
if 
they 
had 
been 
placed. 


When 
the 
show 
was 
passed, 
the 
Jew 
said 
to 
me, 
“I 
shall 
not 
be 
able 
to 
attend 
you 
as 
I 
would, 
in 
regard 
of 
some 
charge 
the 
city 
hath 
laid 
upon 
me 
for 
the 
entertaining 
of 
this 
great 
person.” 
Three 
days 
after 
the 
Jew 
came 
to 
me 
again, 
and 
said: 
“Ye 
are 
happy 
men; 
for 
the 
father 
of 
Salomon’s 
House 
taketh 
knowledge 
of 
your 
being 
here, 
and 
commanded 
me 
to 
tell 
you 
that 
he 
will 
admit 
all 
your 
company 
to 
his 
presence, 
and 
have 
private 
conference 
with 
one 
of 
you, 
that 
ye 
shall 
choose; 
and 
for 
this 
hath 
appointed 
the 
next 
day 
after 
tomorrow. 
And 
because 
he 
meaneth 
to 
give 
you 
his 
blessing, 
he 
hath 
appointed 
it 
in 
the 
forenoon.” 
We 
came 
at 
our 
day 
and 
hour, 
and 
I 
was 
chosen 
by 
my 
fellows 
for 
the 
private 
access. 
We 
found 
him 
in 
a 
fair 
chamber, 
richly 
hanged, 
and 
carpeted 
under 
foot, 
without 
any 
degrees 
to 
the 
state; 
he 
was 
set 
upon 
a 
low 
throne 
richly 
adorned, 
and 
a 
rich 
cloth 
of 
state 
over 
his 
head 
of 
blue 
satin 
embroidered. 
He 
was 
alone, 
save 
that 
he 
had 
two 
pages 
of 
honor, 
on 
either 



hand 
one, 
finely 
attired 
in 
white. 
His 
undergarments 
were 
the 
like 
that 
we 
saw 
him 
wear 
in 
the 
chariot; 
but 
instead 
of 
his 
gown, 
he 
had 
on 
him 
a 
mantle 
with 
a 
cape, 
of 
the 
same 
fine 
black, 
fastened 
about 
him. 
When 
we 
came 
in, 
as 
we 
were 
taught, 
we 
bowed 
low 
at 
our 
first 
entrance; 
and 
when 
we 
were 
come 
near 
his 
chair, 
he 
stood 
up, 
holding 
forth 
his 
hand 
ungloved, 
and 
in 
posture 
of 
blessing; 
and 
we 
every 
one 
of 
us 
stooped 
down 
and 
kissed 
the 
end 
of 
his 
tippet. 
That 
done, 
the 
rest 
departed, 
and 
I 
remained. 
Then 
he 
warned 
the 
pages 
forth 
of 
the 
room, 
and 
caused 
me 
to 
sit 
down 
beside 
him, 
and 
spake 
to 
me 
thus 
in 
the 
Spanish 
tongue: 


“God 
bless 
thee, 
my 
son; 
I 
will 
give 
thee 
the 
greatest 
jewel 
I 
have. 
For 
I 
will 
impart 
unto 
thee, 
for 
the 
love 
of 
God 
and 
men, 
a 
relation 
of 
the 
true 
state 
of 
Salomon’s 
House. 
Son, 
to 
make 
you 
know 
the 
true 
state 
of 
Salomon’s 
House, 
I 
will 
keep 
this 
order. 
First, 
I 
will 
set 
forth 
unto 
you 
the 
end 
of 
our 
foundation. 
Secondly, 
the 
preparations 
and 
instruments 
we 
have 
for 
our 
works. 
Thirdly, 
the 
several 
employments 
and 
functions 
whereto 
our 
fellows 
are 
assigned. 
And 
fourthly, 
the 
ordinances 
and 
rites 
which 
we 
observe. 


“The 
end 
of 
our 
foundation 
is 
the 
knowledge 
of 
causes, 
and 
secret 
motions 
of 
things; 
and 
the 
enlarging 
of 
the 
bounds 
of 
human 
empire, 
to 
the 
effecting 
of 
all 
things 
possible. 


“The 
preparations 
and 
instruments 
are 
these: 
We 
have 
large 
and 
deep 
caves 
of 
several 
depths; 
the 
deepest 
are 
sunk 
600 
fathoms; 
and 
some 
of 
them 
are 
digged 
and 
made 
under 
great 
hills 
and 
mountains; 
so 
that 
if 
you 
reckon 
together 
the 
depth 
of 
the 
hill 
and 
the 
depth 
of 
the 
cave, 
they 
are, 
some 
of 
them, 
above 
three 
miles 
deep. 
For 
we 
find 
that 
the 
depth 
of 
a 
hill 
and 
the 
depth 
of 
a 
cave 
from 
the 
flat 
are 
the 
same 
thing; 
both 
remote 
alike 
from 
the 
sun 
and 
heaven’s 
beams, 
and 
from 
the 
open 
air. 
These 
caves 
we 
call 
the 
lower 
region. 
And 
we 
use 
them 
for 
all 
coagulations, 
indurations, 
refrigerations, 
and 
conservations 
of 
bodies. 
We 
use 
them 
likewise 
for 
the 
imitation 
of 
natural 
mines 
and 
the 
producing 
also 
of 
new 
artificial 
metals, 
by 
compositions 
and 
materials 
which 
we 
use 
and 
lay 
there 
for 
many 
years. 
We 
use 
them 
also 
sometimes 
(which 
may 
seem 
strange) 
for 
curing 
of 
some 
diseases, 
and 
for 
prolongation 
of 
life, 
in 
some 
hermits 
that 
choose 
to 
live 
there, 
well 
accommodated 
of 
all 
things 
necessary, 
and 
indeed 
live 
very 
long; 
by 
whom 
also 
we 
learn 
many 
things. 


“We 
have 
burials 
in 
several 
earths, 
where 
we 
put 
divers 
cements, 
as 



the 
Chinese 
do 
their 
porcelain. 
But 
we 
have 
them 
in 
greater 
variety, 
and 
some 
of 
them 
more 
fine. 
We 
also 
have 
great 
variety 
of 
composts 
and 
soils, 
for 
the 
making 
of 
the 
earth 
fruitful. 


“We 
have 
high 
towers, 
the 
highest 
about 
half 
a 
mile 
in 
height, 
and 
some 
of 
them 
likewise 
set 
upon 
high 
mountains, 
so 
that 
the 
vantage 
of 
the 
hill 
with 
the 
tower 
is 
in 
the 
highest 
of 
them 
three 
miles 
at 
least. 
And 
these 
places 
we 
call 
the 
upper 
region, 
account 
the 
air 
between 
the 
high 
places 
and 
the 
low 
as 
a 
middle 
region. 
We 
use 
these 
towers, 
according 
to 
their 
several 
heights 
and 
situations, 
for 
insulation, 
refrigeration, 
conservation, 
and 
for 
the 
view 
of 
divers 
meteors 
— 
as 
winds, 
rain, 
snow, 
hail, 
and 
some 
of 
the 
fiery 
meteors 
also. 
And 
upon 
them 
in 
some 
places 
are 
dwellings 
of 
hermits, 
whom 
we 
visit 
sometimes 
and 
instruct 
what 
to 
observe. 


“We 
have 
great 
lakes, 
both 
salt 
and 
fresh, 
whereof 
we 
have 
use 
for 
the 
fish 
and 
fowl. 
We 
use 
them 
also 
for 
burials 
of 
some 
natural 
bodies, 
for 
we 
find 
a 
difference 
in 
things 
buried 
in 
earth, 
or 
in 
air 
below 
the 
earth, 
and 
things 
buried 
in 
water. 
We 
have 
also 
pools, 
of 
which 
some 
do 
strain 
fresh 
water 
out 
of 
salt, 
and 
others 
by 
art 
do 
turn 
fresh 
water 
into 
salt. 
We 
have 
also 
some 
rocks 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
sea, 
and 
some 
bays 
upon 
the 
shore 
for 
some 
works, 
wherein 
are 
required 
the 
air 
and 
vapor 
of 
the 
sea. 
We 
have 
likewise 
violent 
streams 
and 
cataracts, 
which 
serve 
us 
for 
many 
motions; 
and 
likewise 
engines 
for 
multiplying 
and 
enforcing 
of 
winds 
to 
set 
also 
on 
divers 
motions. 


“We 
have 
also 
a 
number 
of 
artificial 
wells 
and 
fountains, 
made 
in 
imitation 
of 
the 
natural 
sources 
and 
baths, 
as 
tincted 
upon 
vitriol, 
sulphur, 
steel, 
brass, 
lead, 
nitre, 
and 
other 
minerals; 
and 
again, 
we 
have 
little 
wells 
for 
infusions 
of 
many 
things, 
where 
the 
waters 
take 
the 
virtue 
quicker 
and 
better 
than 
in 
vessels 
or 
basins. 
And 
among 
them 
we 
have 
a 
water, 
which 
we 
call 
water 
of 
paradise, 
being 
by 
that 
we 
do 
it 
made 
very 
sovereign 
for 
health 
and 
prolongation 
of 
life. 


“We 
have 
also 
great 
and 
spacious 
houses, 
where 
we 
imitate 
and 
demonstrate 
meteors 
— 
as 
snow, 
hail, 
rain, 
some 
artificial 
rains 
of 
bodies 
and 
not 
of 
water, 
thunders, 
lightnings; 
also 
generations 
of 
bodies 
in 
air 
— 
as 
frogs, 
flies, 
and 
divers 
others. 


“We 
have 
also 
certain 
chambers, 
which 
we 
call 
chambers 
of 
health, 
where 
we 
qualify 
the 
air 
as 
we 
think 
good 
and 
proper 
for 
the 
cure 
of 
divers 
diseases 
and 
preservation 
of 
health. 



“We 
have 
also 
fair 
and 
large 
baths, 
of 
several 
mixtures, 
for 
the 
cure 
of 
diseases, 
and 
the 
restoring 
of 
man’s 
body 
from 
arefaction; 
and 
others 
for 
the 
confirming 
of 
it 
in 
strength 
of 
sinews, 
vital 
parts, 
and 
the 
very 
juice 
and 
substance 
of 
the 
body. 


“We 
have 
also 
large 
and 
various 
orchards 
and 
gardens, 
wherein 
we 
do 
not 
so 
much 
respect 
beauty 
as 
variety 
of 
ground 
and 
soil, 
proper 
for 
divers 
trees 
and 
herbs, 
and 
some 
very 
spacious, 
where 
trees 
and 
berries 
are 
set, 
whereof 
we 
make 
divers 
kinds 
of 
drinks, 
beside 
the 
vineyards. 
In 
these 
we 
practise 
likewise 
all 
conclusions 
of 
grafting, 
and 
inoculating, 
as 
well 
of 
wild-
trees 
as 
fruit-trees, 
which 
produceth 
many 
effects. 
And 
we 
make 
by 
art, 
in 
the 
same 
orchards 
and 
gardens, 
trees 
and 
flowers, 
to 
come 
earlier 
or 
later 
than 
their 
seasons, 
and 
to 
come 
up 
and 
bear 
more 
speedily 
than 
by 
their 
natural 
course 
they 
do. 
We 
make 
them 
also 
by 
art 
greater 
much 
than 
their 
nature; 
and 
their 
fruit 
greater 
and 
sweeter, 
and 
of 
differing 
taste, 
smell, 
color, 
and 
figure, 
from 
their 
nature. 
And 
many 
of 
them 
we 
so 
order 
as 
that 
they 
become 
of 
medicinal 
use. 


“We 
have 
also 
means 
to 
make 
divers 
plants 
rise 
by 
mixtures 
of 
earths 
without 
seeds, 
and 
likewise 
to 
make 
divers 
new 
plants, 
differing 
from 
the 
vulgar, 
and 
to 
make 
one 
tree 
or 
plant 
turn 
into 
another. 


“We 
have 
also 
parks, 
and 
enclosures 
of 
all 
sorts, 
of 
beasts 
and 
birds; 
which 
we 
use 
not 
only 
for 
view 
or 
rareness, 
but 
likewise 
for 
dissections 
and 
trials, 
that 
thereby 
may 
take 
light 
what 
may 
be 
wrought 
upon 
the 
body 
of 
man. 
Wherein 
we 
find 
many 
strange 
effects: 
as 
continuing 
life 
in 
them, 
though 
divers 
parts, 
which 
you 
account 
vital, 
be 
perished 
and 
taken 
forth; 
resuscitating 
of 
some 
that 
seem 
dead 
in 
appearance, 
and 
the 
like. 
We 
try 
also 
all 
poisons, 
and 
other 
medicines 
upon 
them, 
as 
well 
of 
chirurgery 
as 
physic. 
By 
art 
likewise 
we 
make 
them 
greater 
or 
smaller 
than 
their 
kind 
is, 
and 
contrariwise 
dwarf 
them 
and 
stay 
their 
growth; 
we 
make 
them 
more 
fruitful 
and 
bearing 
than 
their 
kind 
is, 
and 
contrariwise 
barren 
and 
not 
generative. 
Also 
we 
make 
them 
differ 
in 
color, 
shape, 
activity, 
many 
ways. 
We 
find 
means 
to 
make 
commixtures 
and 
copulations 
of 
divers 
kinds, 
which 
have 
produced 
many 
new 
kinds, 
and 
them 
not 
barren, 
as 
the 
general 
opinion 
is. 
We 
make 
a 
number 
of 
kinds 
of 
serpents, 
worms, 
flies, 
fishes 
of 
putrefaction, 
whereof 
some 
are 
advanced 
(in 
effect) 
to 
be 
perfect 
creatures, 
like 
beasts 
or 
birds, 
and 
have 
sexes, 
and 
do 
propagate. 
Neither 
do 
we 
this 
by 
chance, 
but 
we 
know 
beforehand 
of 
what 
matter 
and 
commixture, 
what 
kind 
of 
those 



creatures 
will 
arise. 


“We 
have 
also 
particular 
pools 
where 
we 
make 
trials 
upon 
fishes, 
as 
we 
have 
said 
before 
of 
beasts 
and 
birds. 


“We 
have 
also 
places 
for 
breed 
and 
generation 
of 
those 
kinds 
of 
worms 
and 
flies 
which 
are 
of 
special 
use; 
such 
as 
are 
with 
you 
your 
silkworms 
and 
bees. 


“I 
will 
not 
hold 
you 
long 
with 
recounting 
of 
our 
brewhouses, 
bake-
houses, 
and 
kitchens, 
where 
are 
made 
divers 
drinks, 
breads, 
and 
meats, 
rare 
and 
of 
special 
effects. 
Wines 
we 
have 
of 
grapes, 
and 
drinks 
of 
other 
juice, 
of 
fruits, 
of 
grains, 
and 
of 
roots, 
and 
of 
mixtures 
with 
honey, 
sugar, 
manna, 
and 
fruits 
dried 
and 
decocted; 
also 
of 
the 
tears 
or 
wounding 
of 
trees 
and 
of 
the 
pulp 
of 
canes. 
And 
these 
drinks 
are 
of 
several 
ages, 
some 
to 
the 
age 
or 
last 
of 
forty 
years. 
We 
have 
drinks 
also 
brewed 
with 
several 
herbs 
and 
roots 
and 
spices; 
yea, 
with 
several 
fleshes 
and 
white 
meats; 
whereof 
some 
of 
the 
drinks 
are 
such 
as 
they 
are 
in 
effect 
meat 
and 
drink 
both, 
so 
that 
divers, 
especially 
in 
age, 
do 
desire 
to 
live 
with 
them 
with 
little 
or 
no 
meat 
or 
bread. 
And 
above 
all 
we 
strive 
to 
have 
drinks 
of 
extreme 
thin 
parts, 
to 
insinuate 
into 
the 
body, 
and 
yet 
without 
all 
biting, 
sharpness, 
or 
fretting; 
insomuch 
as 
some 
of 
them 
put 
upon 
the 
back 
of 
your 
hand, 
will 
with 
a 
little 
stay 
pass 
through 
to 
the 
palm, 
and 
yet 
taste 
mild 
to 
the 
mouth. 
We 
have 
also 
waters, 
which 
we 
ripen 
in 
that 
fashion, 
as 
they 
become 
nourishing, 
so 
that 
they 
are 
indeed 
excellent 
drinks, 
and 
many 
will 
use 
no 
other. 
Bread 
we 
have 
of 
several 
grains, 
roots, 
and 
kernels; 
yea, 
and 
some 
of 
flesh, 
and 
fish, 
dried; 
with 
divers 
kinds 
of 
leavings 
and 
seasonings; 
so 
that 
some 
do 
extremely 
move 
appetites, 
some 
do 
nourish 
so 
as 
divers 
do 
live 
of 
them, 
without 
any 
other 
meat, 
who 
live 
very 
long. 
So 
for 
meats, 
we 
have 
some 
of 
them 
so 
beaten, 
and 
made 
tender, 
and 
mortified, 
yet 
without 
all 
corrupting, 
as 
a 
weak 
heat 
of 
the 
stomach 
will 
turn 
them 
into 
good 
chilus, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
strong 
heat 
would 
meat 
otherwise 
prepared. 
We 
have 
some 
meats 
also 
and 
bread, 
and 
drinks, 
which, 
taken 
by 
men, 
enable 
them 
to 
fast 
long 
after; 
and 
some 
other, 
that 
used 
make 
the 
very 
flesh 
of 
men’s 
bodies 
sensibly 
more 
hard 
and 
tough, 
and 
their 
strength 
far 
greater 
than 
otherwise 
it 
would 
be. 


“We 
have 
dispensatories 
or 
shops 
of 
medicines; 
wherein 
you 
may 
easily 
think, 
if 
we 
have 
such 
variety 
of 
plants, 
and 
living 
creatures, 
more 
than 
you 
have 
in 
Europe 
(for 
we 
know 
what 
you 
have), 
the 
simples, 
drugs, 
and 



ingredients 
of 
medicines, 
must 
likewise 
be 
in 
so 
much 
the 
greater 
variety. 
We 
have 
them 
likewise 
of 
divers 
ages, 
and 
long 
fermentations. 
And 
for 
their 
preparations, 
we 
have 
not 
only 
all 
manner 
of 
exquisite 
distillations, 
and 
separations, 
and 
especially 
by 
gentle 
heats, 
and 
percolations 
through 
divers 
strainers, 
yea, 
and 
substances; 
but 
also 
exact 
forms 
of 
composition, 
whereby 
they 
incorporate 
almost 
as 
they 
were 
natural 
simples. 


“We 
have 
also 
divers 
mechanical 
arts, 
which 
you 
have 
not; 
and 
stuffs 
made 
by 
them, 
as 
papers, 
linen, 
silks, 
tissues, 
dainty 
works 
of 
feathers 
of 
wonderful 
lustre, 
excellent 
dyes, 
and 
many 
others, 
and 
shops 
likewise 
as 
well 
for 
such 
as 
are 
not 
brought 
into 
vulgar 
use 
among 
us, 
as 
for 
those 
that 
are. 
For 
you 
must 
know, 
that 
of 
the 
things 
before 
recited, 
many 
of 
them 
are 
grown 
into 
use 
throughout 
the 
kingdom, 
but 
yet, 
if 
they 
did 
flow 
from 
our 
invention, 
we 
have 
of 
them 
also 
for 
patterns 
and 
principals. 


“We 
have 
also 
furnaces 
of 
great 
diversities, 
and 
that 
keep 
great 
diversity 
of 
heats; 
fierce 
and 
quick, 
strong 
and 
constant, 
soft 
and 
mild, 
blown, 
quiet, 
dry, 
moist, 
and 
the 
like. 
But 
above 
all 
we 
have 
heats, 
in 
imitation 
of 
the 
sun’s 
and 
heavenly 
bodies’ 
heats, 
that 
pass 
divers 
inequalities, 
and 
as 
it 
were 
orbs, 
progresses, 
and 
returns 
whereby 
we 
produce 
admirable 
effects. 
Be 
sides, 
we 
have 
heats 
of 
dungs, 
and 
of 
bellies 
and 
maws 
of 
living 
creatures 
and 
of 
their 
bloods 
and 
bodies, 
and 
of 
hays 
and 
herbs 
laid 
up 
moist, 
of 
lime 
unquenched, 
and 
such 
like. 
Instruments 
also 
which 
generate 
heat 
only 
by 
motion. 
And 
farther, 
places 
for 
strong 
insulations; 
and, 
again, 
places 
under 
the 
earth, 
which 
by 
nature 
or 
art 
yield 
heat. 
These 
divers 
heats 
we 
use 
as 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
operation 
which 
we 
intend 
requireth. 


“We 
have 
also 
perspective 
houses, 
where 
we 
make 
demonstrations 
of 
all 
lights 
and 
radiations 
and 
of 
all 
colors; 
and 
out 
of 
things 
uncolored 
and 
transparent 
we 
can 
represent 
unto 
you 
all 
several 
colors, 
not 
in 
rainbows, 
as 
it 
is 
in 
gems 
and 
prisms, 
but 
of 
themselves 
single. 
We 
represent 
also 
all 
multiplications 
of 
light, 
which 
we 
carry 
to 
great 
distance, 
and 
make 
so 
sharp 
as 
to 
discern 
small 
points 
and 
lines. 
Also 
all 
colorations 
of 
light: 
all 
delusions 
and 
deceits 
of 
the 
sight, 
in 
figures, 
magnitudes, 
motions, 
colors; 
all 
demonstrations 
of 
shadows. 
We 
find 
also 
divers 
means, 
yet 
unknown 
to 
you, 
of 
producing 
of 
light, 
originally 
from 
divers 
bodies. 
We 
procure 
means 
of 
seeing 
objects 
afar 
off, 
as 
in 
the 
heaven 
and 
remote 
places; 
and 
represent 
things 
near 
as 
afar 
off, 
and 
things 
afar 
off 
as 
near; 
making 
feigned 
distances. 
We 
have 
also 
helps 
for 
the 
sight 
far 
above 
spectacles 
and 
glasses 
in 
use; 
we 



have 
also 
glasses 
and 
means 
to 
see 
small 
and 
minute 
bodies, 
perfectly 
and 
distinctly; 
as 
the 
shapes 
and 
colors 
of 
small 
flies 
and 
worms, 
grains, 
and 
flaws 
in 
gems 
which 
cannot 
otherwise 
be 
seen, 
observations 
in 
urine 
and 
blood 
not 
otherwise 
to 
be 
seen. 
We 
make 
artificial 
rainbows, 
halos, 
and 
circles 
about 
light. 
We 
represent 
also 
all 
manner 
of 
reflections, 
refractions, 
and 
multiplications 
of 
visual 
beams 
of 
objects. 


“We 
have 
also 
precious 
stones, 
of 
all 
kinds, 
many 
of 
them 
of 
great 
beauty 
and 
to 
you 
unknown, 
crystals 
likewise, 
and 
glasses 
of 
divers 
kind; 
and 
among 
them 
some 
of 
metals 
vitrificated, 
and 
other 
materials, 
besides 
those 
of 
which 
you 
make 
glass. 
Also 
a 
number 
of 
fossils 
and 
imperfect 
minerals, 
which 
you 
have 
not. 
Likewise 
loadstones 
of 
prodigious 
virtue, 
and 
other 
rare 
stones, 
both 
natural 
and 
artificial. 


“We 
have 
also 
sound-houses, 
where 
we 
practise 
and 
demonstrate 
all 
sounds 
and 
their 
generation. 
We 
have 
harmony 
which 
you 
have 
not, 
of 
quarter-sounds 
and 
lesser 
slides 
of 
sounds. 
Divers 
instruments 
of 
music 
likewise 
to 
you 
unknown, 
some 
sweeter 
than 
any 
you 
have; 
with 
bells 
and 
rings 
that 
are 
dainty 
and 
sweet. 
We 
represent 
small 
sounds 
as 
great 
and 
deep, 
likewise 
great 
sounds 
extenuate 
and 
sharp; 
we 
make 
divers 
tremblings 
and 
warblings 
of 
sounds, 
which 
in 
their 
original 
are 
entire. 
We 
represent 
and 
imitate 
all 
articulate 
sounds 
and 
letters, 
and 
the 
voices 
and 
notes 
of 
beasts 
and 
birds. 
We 
have 
certain 
helps 
which, 
set 
to 
the 
ear, 
do 
further 
the 
hearing 
greatly; 
we 
have 
also 
divers 
strange 
and 
artificial 
echoes, 
reflecting 
the 
voice 
many 
times, 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
tossing 
it; 
and 
some 
that 
give 
back 
the 
voice 
louder 
than 
it 
came, 
some 
shriller 
and 
some 
deeper; 
yea, 
some 
rendering 
the 
voice, 
differing 
in 
the 
letters 
or 
articulate 
sound 
from 
that 
they 
receive. 
We 
have 
all 
means 
to 
convey 
sounds 
in 
trunks 
and 
pipes, 
in 
strange 
lines 
and 
distances. 


“We 
have 
also 
perfume-houses, 
wherewith 
we 
join 
also 
practices 
of 
taste. 
We 
multiply 
smells 
which 
may 
seem 
strange: 
we 
imitate 
smells, 
making 
all 
smells 
to 
breathe 
out 
of 
other 
mixtures 
than 
those 
that 
give 
them. 
We 
make 
divers 
imitations 
of 
taste 
likewise, 
so 
that 
they 
will 
deceive 
any 
man’s 
taste. 
And 
in 
this 
house 
we 
contain 
also 
a 
confiture-house, 
where 
we 
make 
all 
sweatmeats, 
dry 
and 
moist, 
and 
divers 
pleasant 
wines, 
milks, 
broths, 
and 
salads, 
far 
in 
greater 
variety 
than 
you 
have. 


“We 
have 
also 
engine-houses, 
where 
are 
prepared 
engines 
and 



instruments 
for 
all 
sorts 
of 
motions. 
There 
we 
imitate 
and 
practise 
to 
make 
swifter 
motions 
than 
any 
you 
have, 
either 
out 
of 
your 
muskets 
or 
any 
engine 
that 
you 
have; 
and 
to 
make 
them 
and 
multiply 
them 
more 
easily 
and 
with 
small 
force, 
by 
wheels 
and 
other 
means, 
and 
to 
make 
them 
stronger 
and 
more 
violent 
than 
yours 
are, 
exceeding 
your 
greatest 
cannons 
and 
basilisks. 
We 
represent 
also 
ordnance 
and 
instruments 
of 
war 
and 
engines 
of 
all 
kinds; 
and 
likewise 
new 
mixtures 
and 
compositions 
of 
gunpowder, 
wild-fires 
burning 
in 
water 
and 
un 
quenchable, 
also 
fire-works 
of 
all 
variety, 
both 
for 
pleasure 
and 
use. 
We 
imitate 
also 
flights 
of 
birds; 
we 
have 
some 
degrees 
of 
flying 
in 
the 
air. 
We 
have 
ships 
and 
boats 
for 
going 
under 
water 
and 
brooking 
of 
seas, 
also 
swimming-girdles 
and 
supporters. 
We 
have 
divers 
curious 
clocks 
and 
other 
like 
motions 
of 
return, 
and 
some 
perpetual 
motions. 
We 
imitate 
also 
motions 
of 
living 
creatures 
by 
images 
of 
men, 
beasts, 
birds, 
fishes, 
and 
serpents; 
we 
have 
also 
a 
great 
number 
of 
other 
various 
motions, 
strange 
for 
equality, 
fineness, 
and 
subtilty. 


“We 
have 
also 
a 
mathematical-house, 
where 
are 
represented 
all 
instruments, 
as 
well 
of 
geometry 
as 
astronomy, 
exquisitely 
made. 


“We 
have 
also 
houses 
of 
deceits 
of 
the 
senses, 
where 
we 
represent 
all 
manner 
of 
feats 
of 
juggling, 
false 
apparitions, 
im 
postures 
and 
illusions, 
and 
their 
fallacies. 
And 
surely 
you 
will 
easily 
believe 
that 
we, 
that 
have 
so 
many 
things 
truly 
natural 
which 
induce 
admiration, 
could 
in 
a 
world 
of 
particulars 
deceive 
the 
senses 
if 
we 
would 
disguise 
those 
things, 
and 
labor 
to 
make 
them 
more 
miraculous. 
But 
we 
do 
hate 
all 
impostures 
and 
lies, 
insomuch 
as 
we 
have 
severely 
forbidden 
it 
to 
all 
our 
fellows, 
under 
pain 
of 
ignominy 
and 
fines, 
that 
they 
do 
not 
show 
any 
natural 
work 
or 
thing 
adorned 
or 
swelling, 
but 
only 
pure 
as 
it 
is, 
and 
without 
all 
affectation 
of 
strangeness. 


“These 
are, 
my 
son, 
the 
riches 
of 
Salomon’s 
House. 


“For 
the 
several 
employments 
and 
offices 
of 
our 
fellows, 
we 
have 
twelve 
that 
sail 
into 
foreign 
countries 
under 
the 
names 
of 
other 
nations 
(for 
our 
own 
we 
conceal), 
who 
bring 
us 
the 
books 
and 
abstracts, 
and 
patterns 
of 
experiments 
of 
all 
other 
parts. 
These 
we 
call 
merchants 
of 
light. 


“We 
have 
three 
that 
collect 
the 
experiments 
which 
are 
in 
all 
books. 
These 
we 
call 
depredators. 


“We 
have 
three 
that 
collect 
the 
experiments 
of 
all 
mechanical 
arts, 



and 
also 
of 
liberal 
sciences, 
and 
also 
of 
practices 
which 
are 
not 
brought 
into 
arts. 
These 
we 
call 
mystery-men. 


“We 
have 
three 
that 
try 
new 
experiments, 
such 
as 
themselves 
think 
good. 
These 
we 
call 
pioneers 
or 
miners. 


“We 
have 
three 
that 
draw 
the 
experiments 
of 
the 
former 
four 
into 
titles 
and 
tables, 
to 
give 
the 
better 
light 
for 
the 
drawing 
of 
observations 
and 
axioms 
out 
of 
them. 
These 
we 
call 
compilers. 
We 
have 
three 
that 
bend 
themselves, 
looking 
into 
the 
experiments 
of 
their 
fellows, 
and 
cast 
about 
how 
to 
draw 
out 
of 
them 
things 
of 
use 
and 
practice 
for 
man’s 
life 
and 
knowledge, 
as 
well 
for 
works 
as 
for 
plain 
demonstration 
of 
causes, 
means 
of 
natural 
divinations, 
and 
the 
easy 
and 
clear 
discovery 
of 
the 
virtues 
and 
parts 
of 
bodies. 
These 
we 
call 
dowry-men 
or 
benefactors. 


“Then 
after 
divers 
meetings 
and 
consults 
of 
our 
whole 
number, 
to 
consider 
of 
the 
former 
labors 
and 
collections, 
we 
have 
three 
that 
take 
care 
out 
of 
them 
to 
direct 
new 
experiments, 
of 
a 
higher 
light, 
more 
penetrating 
into 
nature 
than 
the 
former. 
These 
we 
call 
lamps. 


“We 
have 
three 
others 
that 
do 
execute 
the 
experiments 
so 
directed, 
and 
report 
them. 
These 
we 
call 
inoculators. 


“Lastly, 
we 
have 
three 
that 
raise 
the 
former 
discoveries 
by 
experiments 
into 
greater 
observations, 
axioms, 
and 
aphorisms. 
These 
we 
call 
interpreters 
of 
nature. 


“We 
have 
also, 
as 
you 
must 
think, 
novices 
and 
apprentices, 
that 
the 
succession 
of 
the 
former 
employed 
men 
do 
not 
fail; 
besides 
a 
great 
number 
of 
servants 
and 
attendants, 
men 
and 
women. 
And 
this 
we 
do 
also: 
we 
have 
consultations, 
which 
of 
the 
inventions 
and 
experiences 
which 
we 
have 
discovered 
shall 
be 
published, 
and 
which 
not; 
and 
take 
all 
an 
oath 
of 
secrecy 
for 
the 
concealing 
of 
those 
which 
we 
think 
fit 
to 
keep 
secret; 
though 
some 
of 
those 
we 
do 
reveal 
sometime 
to 
the 
State, 
and 
some 
not. 


“For 
our 
ordinances 
and 
rites 
we 
have 
two 
very 
long 
and 
fair 
galleries. 
In 
one 
of 
these 
we 
place 
patterns 
and 
samples 
of 
all 
manner 
of 
the 
more 
rare 
and 
excellent 
inventions; 
in 
the 
other 
we 
place 
the 
statues 
of 
all 
principal 
inventors. 
There 
we 
have 
the 
statue 
of 
your 
Columbus, 
that 
discovered 
the 
West 
Indies, 
also 
the 
inventor 
of 
ships, 
your 
monk 
that 
was 
the 
inventor 
of 
ordnance 
and 
of 
gunpowder, 
the 
inventor 
of 
music, 
the 



inventor 
of 
letters, 
the 
inventor 
of 
printing, 
the 
inventor 
of 
observations 
of 
astronomy, 
the 
inventor 
of 
works 
in 
metal, 
the 
inventor 
of 
glass, 
the 
inventor 
of 
silk 
of 
the 
worm, 
the 
inventor 
of 
wine, 
the 
inventor 
of 
corn 
and 
bread, 
the 
inventor 
of 
sugars; 
and 
all 
these 
by 
more 
certain 
tradition 
than 
you 
have. 
Then 
we 
have 
divers 
inventors 
of 
our 
own, 
of 
excellent 
works; 
which, 
since 
you 
have 
not 
seen) 
it 
were 
too 
long 
to 
make 
descriptions 
of 
them; 
and 
besides, 
in 
the 
right 
understanding 
of 
those 
descriptions 
you 
might 
easily 
err. 
For 
upon 
every 
invention 
of 
value 
we 
erect 
a 
statue 
to 
the 
inventor, 
and 
give 
him 
a 
liberal 
and 
honorable 
reward. 
These 
statues 
are 
some 
of 
brass, 
some 
of 
marble 
and 
touchstone, 
some 
of 
cedar 
and 
other 
special 
woods 
gilt 
and 
adorned; 
some 
of 
iron, 
some 
of 
silver, 
some 
of 
gold. 


“We 
have 
certain 
hymns 
and 
services, 
which 
we 
say 
daily, 
of 
laud 
and 
thanks 
to 
God 
for 
His 
marvellous 
works. 
And 
forms 
of 
prayers, 
imploring 
His 
aid 
and 
blessing 
for 
the 
illumination 
of 
our 
labors; 
and 
turning 
them 
into 
good 
and 
holy 
uses. 


“Lastly, 
we 
have 
circuits 
or 
visits, 
of 
divers 
principal 
cities 
of 
the 
kingdom; 
where 
as 
it 
cometh 
to 
pass 
we 
do 
publish 
such 
new 
profitable 
inventions 
as 
we 
think 
good. 
And 
we 
do 
also 
declare 
natural 
divinations 
of 
diseases, 
plagues, 
swarms 
of 
hurtful 
creatures, 
scarcity, 
tempest, 
earthquakes, 
great 
inundations, 
comets, 
temperature 
of 
the 
year, 
and 
divers 
other 
things; 
and 
we 
give 
counsel 
thereupon, 
what 
the 
people 
shall 
do 
for 
the 
prevention 
and 
remedy 
of 
them.” 


And 
when 
he 
had 
said 
this 
he 
stood 
up, 
and 
I, 
as 
I 
had 
been 
taught, 
knelt 
down; 
and 
he 
laid 
his 
right 
hand 
upon 
my 
head, 
and 
said: 
“God 
bless 
thee, 
my 
son, 
and 
God 
bless 
this 
relation 
which 
I 
have 
made. 
I 
give 
thee 
leave 
to 
publish 
it, 
for 
the 
good 
of 
other 
nations; 
for 
we 
here 
are 
in 
God’s 
bosom, 
a 
land 
unknown.” 
And 
so 
he 
left 
me; 
having 
assigned 
a 
value 
of 
about 
2,000 
ducats 
for 
a 
bounty 
to 
me 
and 
my 
fellows. 
For 
they 
give 
great 
largesses, 
where 
they 
come, 
upon 
all 
occasions.

Preface 
by 
Robert 
Leslie 
Ellis 


The 
following 
fragments 
of 
a 
great 
work 
on 
the 
Interpretation 
of 
Nature 
were 
first 
published 
in 
Stephens’s 
Letters 
and 
Remains 
[1734]. 
They 
consist 
partly 
of 
detached 
passages, 
and 
partly 
of 
an 
epitome 
of 
twelve 
chapters 
of 
the 
first 
book 
of 
the 
proposed 
work. 
The 
detached 
passages 
contain 
the 
first, 
sixth, 
and 
eighth 
chapters, 
and 
portions 
of 
the 
fourth, 
fifth, 
seventh, 
ninth, 
tenth, 
eleventh, 
and 
sixteenth. 
The 
epitome 
contains 
an 
account 
of 
the 
contents 
of 
all 
the 
chapters 
from 
the 
twelfth 
to 
the 
twenty-sixth 
inclusive, 
omitting 
the 
twentieth, 
twentythird, 
and 
twenty-fourth. 
Thus 
the 
sixteenth 
chapter 
is 
mentioned 
both 
in 
the 
epitome 
and 
among 
the 
detached 
passages, 
and 
we 
are 
thus 
enabled 
to 
see 
that 
the 
two 
portions 
of 
the 
following 
tract 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
work, 
as 
it 
appears 
from 
both 
that 
the 
sixteenth 
chapter 
was 
to 
treat 
of 
the 
doctrine 
of 
idola. 


It 
is 
impossible 
to 
ascertain 
the 
motive 
which 
determined 
Bacon 
to 
give 
to 
the 
supposed 
author 
the 
name 
of 
Valerius 
Terminus, 
or 
to 
his 
commentator, 
of 
whose 
annotations 
we 
have 
no 
remains, 
that 
of 
Hermes 
Stella. 
It 
may 
be 
conjectured 
that 
by 
the 
name 
Terminus 
he 
intended 
to 
intimate 
that 
the 
new 
philosophy 
would 
put 
an 
end 
to 
the 
wandering 
of 
mankind 
in 
search 
of 
truth, 
that 
it 
would 
be 
the 
TERMINUS 
AD 
QUEM 
in 
which 
when 
it 
was 
once 
attained 
the 
mind 
would 
finally 
acquiesce. 


Again, 
the 
obscurity 
of 
the 
text 
was 
to 
be 
in 
some 
measure 
removed 
by 
the 
annotations 
of 
Stella; 
not 
however 
wholly, 
for 
Bacon 
in 
the 
epitome 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
chapter 
commends 
the 
manner 
of 
publishing 
knowledge 
“whereby 
it 
shall 
not 
be 
to 
the 
capacity 
nor 
taste 
of 
all, 
but 
shall 
as 
it 
were 
single 
and 
adopt 
his 
reader.” 
Stella 
was 
therefore 
to 
throw 
a 
kind 
of 
starlight 
on 
the 
subject, 
enough 
to 
prevent 
the 
student’s 
losing 
his 
way, 
but 
not 
much 
more. 


However 
this 
may 
be, 
the 
tract 
is 
undoubtedly 
obscure, 
partly 
from 
the 
style 
in 
which 
it 
is 
written, 
and 
partly 
from 
its 
being 
only 
a 
fragment. 
It 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
full 
of 
interest, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
is 
the 
earliest 
type 
of 
the 
INSTAURATIO... 



Note 
to 
Preface 
by 
James 
Spedding: 


The 
manuscript 
from 
which 
Robert 
Stephens 
printed 
these 
fragments 
was 
found 
among 
some 
loose 
papers 
placed 
in 
his 
hands 
by 
the 
Earl 
of 
Oxford, 
and 
is 
now 
in 
the 
British 
Museum; 
Harl. 
manuscripts 
6462. 
It 
is 
a 
thin 
paper 
volume 
of 
the 
quarto 
size, 
written 
in 
the 
hand 
of 
one 
of 
Bacon’s 
servants, 
with 
corrections, 
erasures, 
and 
interlineations 
in 
his 
own. 


The 
chapters 
of 
which 
it 
consists 
are 
both 
imperfect 
in 
themselves 
(all 
but 
three),— 
some 
breaking 
off 
abruptly, 
others 
being 
little 
more 
than 
tables 
of 
contents,— 
and 
imperfect 
in 
their 
connexion 
with 
each 
other; 
so 
much 
so 
as 
to 
suggest 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
number 
of 
separate 
papers 
loosely 
put 
together. 
But 
it 
was 
not 
so 
(and 
the 
fact 
is 
important) 
that 
the 
volume 
itself 
was 
actually 
made 
up. 
However 
they 
came 
together, 
they 
are 
here 
fairly 
and 
consecutively 
copied 
out. 
Though 
it 
be 
a 
collection 
of 
fragments 
therefore, 
it 
is 
such 
a 
collection 
as 
Bacon 
thought 
worthy 
not 
only 
of 
being 
preserved, 
but 
of 
being 
transcribed 
into 
a 
volume; 
and 
a 
particular 
account 
of 
it 
will 
not 
be 
out 
of 
place. 


The 
contents 
of 
the 
manuscript 
before 
Bacon 
touched 
it 
may 
be 
thus 
described. 


A 
titlepage, 
on 
which 
is 
written 
“VALERIUS 
TERMINUS 
of 
the 
Interpretation 
of 
Nature, 
with 
the 
annotations 
of 
HERMES 
STELLA.” 


“Chapter 
I. 
Of 
the 
limits 
and 
end 
of 
knowledge;” 
with 
a 
running 
title, 
“Of 
the 
Interpretation 
of 
Nature.” 


“The 
chapter 
immediately 
following 
the 
Inventory; 
being 
the 
11th 
in 
order.” 


“A 
part 
of 
the 
9th 
chapter, 
immediately 
precedent 
to 
the 
Inventory, 
and 
inducing 
the 
same.” 


“The 
Inventory, 
or 
an 
enumeration 
and 
view 
of 
inventions 
already 
discovered 
and 
in 
use, 
together 
with 
a 
note 
of 
the 
wants 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
supplies; 
being 
the 
10th 
chapter, 
and 
this 
a 
fragment 
only 
of 
the 
same.” 


Part 
of 
a 
chapter, 
not 
numbered, 
“Of 
the 
internal 
and 
profound 
errors 



and 
superstitions 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
mind, 
and 
of 
the 
four 
sorts 
of 
Idols 
or 
fictions 
which 
offer 
themselves 
to 
the 
understanding 
in 
the 
inquisition 
of 
knowledge.” 


“Of 
the 
impediments 
of 
knowledge; 
being 
the 
third 
chapter, 
the 
preface 
only 
of 
it.” 


“Of 
the 
impediments 
which 
have 
been 
in 
the 
times 
and 
in 
diversion 
of 
wits; 
being 
the 
fourth 
chapter.” 


“Of 
the 
impediments 
of 
knowledge 
for 
want 
of 
a 
true 
succession 
of 
wits, 
and 
that 
hitherto 
the 
length 
of 
one 
man’s 
life 
hath 
been 
the 
greatest 
measure 
of 
knowledge; 
being 
the 
fifth 
chapter.” 


“That 
the 
pretended 
succession 
of 
wits 
hath 
been 
evil 
placed, 
forasmuch 
as 
after 
variety 
of 
sects 
and 
opinions 
the 
most 
popular 
and 
not 
the 
truest 
prevaileth 
and 
weareth 
out 
the 
rest; 
being 
the 
sixth 
chapter.” 


“Of 
the 
impediments 
of 
knowledge 
in 
handling 
it 
by 
parts, 
and 
in 
slipping 
off 
particular 
sciences 
from 
the 
root 
and 
stock 
of 
universal 
knowledge; 
being 
the 
seventh 
chapter.” 


“That 
the 
end 
and 
scope 
of 
knowledge 
hath 
been 
generally 
mistaken, 
and 
that 
men 
were 
never 
well 
advised 
what 
it 
was 
they 
sought” 
(part 
of 
a 
chapter 
not 
numbered). 


“An 
abridgment 
of 
divers 
chapters 
of 
the 
first 
book;” 
namely, 
the 
l2th, 
13th, 
and 
14th, 
(over 
which 
is 
a 
running 
title 
“Of 
active 
knowledge;”) 
and 
(without 
any 
running 
title) 
the 
15th, 
16th, 
17th, 
18th], 
19th, 
21st, 
22nd, 
25th, 
and 
26th. 
These 
abridgments 
have 
no 
headings; 
and 
at 
the 
end 
is 
written, 
“The 
end 
of 
the 
Abridgment 
of 
the 
first 
book 
of 
the 
Interpretation 
of 
Nature.” 


Such 
was 
the 
arrangement 
of 
the 
manuscript 
as 
the 
transcriber 
left 
it; 
which 
I 
have 
thought 
worth 
preserving, 
because 
I 
seem 
to 
see 
traces 
in 
it 
of 
two 
separate 
stages 
in 
the 
developement 
of 
the 
work; 
the 
order 
of 
the 
chapters 
as 
they 
are 
transcribed 
being 
probably 
the 
same 
in 
which 
Bacon 
wrote 
them; 
and 
the 
numbers 
inserted 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
headings 
indicating 
the 
order 
in 
which, 
when 
he 
placed 
them 
in 
the 
transcriber’s 
hands, 
it 
was 
his 
intention 
to 
arrange 
them; 
and 
because 
it 
proves 
at 
any 
rate 
that 
at 
that 
time 
the 
design 
of 
the 
whole 
book 
was 
clearly 
laid 
out 
in 
his 
mind. 



There 
is 
nothing, 
unfortunately, 
to 
fix 
the 
DATE 
of 
the 
transcript, 
unless 
it 
be 
implied 
in 
certain 
astronomical 
or 
astrological 
symbols 
written 
on 
the 
blank 
outside 
of 
the 
volume; 
in 
which 
the 
figures 
1603 
occur. 
This 
may 
possibly 
be 
the 
transcriber’s 
note 
of 
the 
time 
when 
he 
finished 
his 
work; 
for 
which 
(but 
for 
one 
circumstance 
which 
I 
shall 
mention 
presently) 
I 
should 
think 
the 
year 
1603 
is 
likely 
a 
date 
as 
any; 
for 
we 
know 
from 
a 
letter 
of 
Bacon’s, 
dated 
3rd 
July 
1603, 
that 
he 
had 
at 
that 
time 
resolved 
“to 
meddle 
as 
little 
as 
possible 
in 
the 
King’s 
causes,” 
and 
to 
“put 
his 
ambition 
wholly 
upon 
his 
pen;” 
and 
we 
know 
from 
the 
ADVANCEMENT 
OF 
LEARNING 
that 
in 
1605 
he 
was 
engaged 
upon 
a 
work 
entitled 
“The 
Interpretation 
of 
Nature:” 
to 
which 
I 
may 
add 
that 
there 
is 
in 
the 
Lambeth 
Library 
a 
copy 
of 
a 
letter 
from 
Bacon 
to 
Lord 
Kinlosse, 
dated 
25th 
March, 
1603, 
and 
written 
in 
the 
same 
hand 
as 
this 
manuscript. 


Bacon’s 
corrections, 
if 
I 
may 
judge 
from 
the 
character 
of 
the 
handwriting, 
were 
inserted 
a 
little 
later; 
for 
it 
is 
a 
fact 
that 
about 
the 
beginning 
of 
James’s 
reign 
his 
writing 
underwent 
a 
remarkable 
change, 
from 
the 
hurried 
Saxon 
hand 
full 
of 
large 
sweeping 
curves 
and 
with 
letters 
imperfectly 
formed 
and 
connected, 
which 
he 
wrote 
in 
Elizabeth’s 
time, 
to 
a 
small, 
neat, 
light, 
and 
compact 
one, 
formed 
more 
upon 
the 
Italian 
model 
which 
was 
then 
coming 
into 
fashion; 
and 
when 
these 
corrections 
were 
made 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
this 
new 
character 
had 
become 
natural 
to 
him 
and 
easy. 
It 
is 
of 
course 
impossible 
to 
fix 
the 
precise 
date 
of 
such 
a 
change,— 
the 
more 
so 
because 
his 
autographs 
of 
this 
period 
are 
very 
scarce,— 
but 
whenever 
it 
was 
that 
he 
corrected 
this 
manuscript, 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
he 
then 
considered 
it 
worthy 
of 
careful 
revision. 
He 
has 
not 
merely 
inserted 
a 
sentence 
here 
and 
there, 
altered 
the 
numbers 
of 
the 
chapters, 
and 
added 
words 
to 
the 
headings 
in 
order 
to 
make 
the 
description 
more 
exact; 
but 
he 
has 
taken 
the 
trouble 
to 
add 
the 
running 
title 
wherever 
it 
was 
wanting, 
thus 
writing 
the 
words 
“of 
the 
Interpretation 
of 
Nature” 
at 
full 
lengths 
not 
less 
than 
eighteen 
times 
over; 
and 
upon 
the 
blank 
space 
of 
the 
titlepage 
he 
has 
written 
out 
a 
complete 
table 
of 
contents. 
In 
short, 
if 
he 
had 
been 
preparing 
the 
manuscript 
for 
the 
press 
or 
for 
a 
fresh 
transcript, 
he 
could 
not 
have 
done 
it 
more 
completely 
or 
carefully,— 
only 
that 
he 
has 
given 
no 
directions 
for 
altering 
the 
order 
of 
the 
chapters 
so 
as 
to 
make 
it 
correspond 
with 
the 
numbers. 
And 
hence 
I 
infer 
that 
up 
to 
the 
time 
when 
he 
made 
these 
corrections, 
this 
was 
the 
form 
of 
the 
great 
work 
on 
which 
he 
was 
engaged: 
it 
was 
a 
work 
concerning 
the 
Interpretation 
of 
Nature; 
which 
was 
to 
begin 
where 
the 
NOVUM 
ORGANUM 
begins; 
and 
of 
which 



the 
first 
book 
was 
to 
include 
all 
the 
preliminary 
considerations 
preparatory 
to 
the 
exposition 
of 
the 
formula. 


I 
place 
this 
fragment 
here 
in 
deference 
to 
Mr. 
Ellis’s 
decided 
opinion 
that 
it 
was 
written 
before 
the 
ADVANCEMENT 
OF 
LEARNING. 
The 
positive 
ground 
indeed 
which 
he 
alleges 
in 
support 
of 
that 
conclusion 
I 
am 
obliged 
to 
set 
aside, 
as 
founded, 
I 
think, 
upon 
a 
misapprehension; 
and 
the 
supposition 
that 
no 
part 
of 
it 
was 
written 
later 
involves 
a 
difficulty 
which 
I 
cannot 
yet 
get 
over 
to 
my 
own 
satisfaction. 
But 
that 
the 
body 
of 
it 
was 
written 
earlier 
I 
see 
no 
reason 
to 
doubt; 
and 
if 
so, 
this 
is 
its 
proper 
place. 


The 
particular 
point 
on 
which 
I 
venture 
to 
disagree 
with 
Mr. 
Ellis 
I 
have 
stated 
in 
a 
note 
upon 
his 
preface 
to 
the 
NOVUM 
ORGANUM, 
promising 
at 
the 
same 
time 
a 
fuller 
explanation 
of 
the 
grounds 
of 
my 
own 
conclusion, 
which 
I 
will 
now 
give. 


The 
question 
is, 
whether 
the 
“Inventory” 
in 
the 
10th 
chapter 
of 
VALERIUS 
TERMINUS 
was 
to 
have 
exhibited 
a 
general 
survey 
of 
the 
state 
of 
knowledge 
corresponding 
with 
that 
which 
fills 
the 
second 
book 
of 
the 
ADVANCEMENT 
OF 
LEARNING. 
I 
think 
not. 


It 
is 
true 
indeed 
that 
the 
title 
of 
that 
10th 
chapter,— 
namely, 
“The 
Inventory, 
or 
an 
enumeration 
and 
view 
of 
inventions 
already 
discovered 
and 
in 
use, 
with 
a 
note 
of 
the 
wants 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
supplies”,— 
has 
at 
first 
sight 
a 
considerable 
resemblance 
to 
the 
description 
of 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
second 
book 
of 
the 
ADVANCEMENT 
OF 
LEARNING,— 
namely, 
“A 
general 
and 
faithful 
perambulation 
of 
learning, 
with 
an 
inquiry 
what 
parts 
thereof 
lie 
fresh 
and 
waste, 
and 
not 
improved 
and 
converted 
by 
the 
industry 
of 
Man;... 
wherein 
nevertheless 
my 
purpose 
is 
at 
this 
time 
to 
note 
only 
omissions 
and 
deficiencies, 
and 
not 
to 
make 
any 
redargutions 
of 
errors,” 
and 
so 
on. 
But 
an 
“enumeration 
of 
INVENTIONS” 
is 
not 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
“a 
perambulation 
of 
LEARNING;” 
and 
it 
will 
be 
found 
upon 
closer 
examination 
that 
the 
“Inventory” 
spoken 
of 
in 
VALERIUS 
TERMINUS 
does 
really 
correspond 
to 
one, 
and 
one 
only, 
of 
the 
fiftyone 
Desiderata 
set 
down 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
DE 
AUGMENTIS; 
viz. 
that 
INVENTARIUM 
OPUM 
HUMANARUM, 
which 
was 
to 
be 
an 
appendix 
to 
the 
MAGIA 
NATURALIS. 
See 
DE 
AUG. 
iii. 
5. 
This 
will 
appear 
clearly 
by 
comparing 
the 
descriptions 
of 
the 
two. 


In 
the 
ADVANCEMENT 
OF 
LEARNING 
Bacon 
tells 
us 
that 
there 



are 
two 
points 
of 
much 
purpose 
pertaining 
to 
the 
department 
of 
Natural 
Magic: 
the 
first 
of 
which 
is, 
“That 
there 
be 
made 
a 
calendar 
resembling 
an 
Inventory 
of 
the 
ESTATE 
OF 
MAN, 
containing 
ALL 
THE 
INVENTIONS, 
BEING 
THE 
WORKS 
OR 
FRUITS 
OF 
NATURE 
OR 
ART, 
which 
are 
now 
extant 
AND 
OF 
WHICH 
MAN 
IS 
ALREADY 
POSSESSED; 
out 
of 
which 
doth 
naturally 
result 
a 
note 
what 
things 
are 
yet 
held 
impossible 
or 
not 
invented; 
which 
calendar 
will 
be 
the 
more 
artificial 
and 
serviceable 
if 
to 
every 
reputed 
impossibility 
you 
add 
what 
thing 
is 
extant 
which 
cometh 
the 
nearest 
in 
degree 
to 
that 
impossibility: 
to 
the 
end 
that 
by 
these 
optatives 
and 
essentials 
man’s 
inquiry 
may 
be 
the 
more 
awake 
in 
deducing 
direction 
of 
works 
from 
the 
speculation 
of 
causes.” 


The 
Inventory 
which 
was 
to 
have 
been 
inserted 
in 
the 
10th 
chapter 
of 
VALERIUS 
TERMINUS 
is 
thus 
introduced:—“The 
plainest 
method 
and 
most 
directly 
pertinent 
to 
this 
intention 
will 
be 
to 
make 
distribution 
of 
SCIENCES, 
ARTS, 
INVENTIONS, 
WORKS, 
and 
their 
portions, 
ACCORDING 
TO 
THE 
USE 
AND 
TRIBUTE 
WHICH 
THEY 
YIELD 
AND 
RENDER 
TO 
THE 
CONDITION 
OF 
MAN’S 
LIFE; 
and 
under 
those 
several 
uses, 
being 
as 
several 
offices 
of 
provisions, 
to 
charge 
and 
tax 
what 
may 
be 
reasonably 
exacted 
or 
demanded,... 
and 
then 
upon 
those 
charges 
and 
taxations 
to 
distinguish 
and 
present 
as 
it 
were 
in 
several 
columns 
what 
is 
extant 
and 
already 
found, 
and 
what 
is 
DEFECTIVE 
AND 
FURTHER 
TO 
BE 
PROVIDED. 
Of 
which 
provisions 
because 
in 
many 
of 
them, 
after 
the 
manner 
of 
slothful 
and 
faulty 
accomptants, 
it 
will 
be 
returned 
by 
way 
of 
excuse 
that 
no 
such 
are 
to 
be 
had, 
it 
will 
be 
fit 
to 
give 
some 
light 
OF 
THE 
NATURE 
OF 
THE 
SUPPLIES; 
whereby 
it 
will 
evidently 
appear 
that 
they 
are 
to 
be 
compassed 
and 
procured.” 
And 
that 
the 
calendar 
was 
to 
deal, 
not 
with 
knowledge 
in 
general, 
but 
only 
with 
arts 
and 
sciences 
of 
invention 
in 
its 
more 
restricted 
sense 
— 
the 
PARS 
OPERATIVA 
DE 
NATURA 
(DE 
AUG. 
iii. 
5.) 


— 
appears 
no 
less 
clearly 
from 
the 
opening 
of 
the 
11th 
chapter, 
which 
was 
designed 
immediately 
to 
follow 
the 
“Inventory.” 
“It 
appeareth 
then 
what 
is 
now 
in 
proposition, 
not 
by 
general 
circumlocution 
but 
by 
particular 
note. 
No 
former 
philosophy,” 
etc. 
etc. 
“but 
the 
revealing 
and 
discovering 
of 
NEW 
INVENTIONS 
AND 
OPERATIONS,... 
the 
nature 
and 
kinds 
of 
which 
inventions 
HAVE 
BEEN 
DESCRIBED 
as 
they 
could 
be 
discovered,” 
etc. 
If 
further 
evidence 
were 
required 
of 
the 
exact 
resemblance 
between 
the 
Inventory 
of 
VALERIUS 
TERMINUS 
and 
the 
Inventarium 
of 
the 
ADVANCEMENT 
and 
the 
DE 
AUGMENTIS, 
I 
might 
quote 
the 
end 
of 
the 

9th 
chapter, 
where 
the 
particular 
expressions 
correspond, 
if 
possible, 
more 
closely 
still. 
But 
I 
presume 
that 
the 
passages 
which 
I 
have 
given 
are 
enough; 
and 
that 
the 
opinion 
which 
I 
have 
elsewhere 
expressed 
as 
to 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
ADVANCEMENT 
OF 
LEARNING,— 
namely, 
that 
the 
writing 
of 
it 
was 
a 
by-thought 
and 
no 
part 
of 
the 
work 
on 
the 
Interpretation 
of 
Nature 
as 
originally 
designed,— 
will 
not 
be 
considered 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
evidence 
afforded 
by 
these 
fragments. 


That 
the 
VALERIUS 
TERMINUS 
was 
composed 
before 
the 
ADVANCEMENT, 
though 
a 
conclusion 
not 
deducible 
from 
the 
Inventory, 
is 
nevertheless 
probable: 
but 
to 
suppose 
that 
it 
was 
so 
composed 
EXACTLY 
IN 
ITS 
PRESENT 
FORM, 
involves, 
as 
I 
said, 
a 
difficulty; 
which 
I 
will 
now 
state. 
The 
point 
is 
interesting, 
as 
bearing 
directly 
upon 
the 
developement 
in 
Bacon’s 
mind 
of 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Idols; 
concerning 
which 
see 
preface 
to 
NOVUM 
ORGANUM, 
note 
C. 
But 
I 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
it 
here 
merely 
as 
bearing 
upon 
the 
probable 
date 
of 
this 
fragment. 


In 
treating 
of 
the 
department 
of 
Logic 
in 
the 
ADVANCEMENT, 
Bacon 
notices 
as 
altogether 
wanting 
“the 
particular 
elenches 
or 
cautions 
against 
three 
false 
appearances” 
or 
fallacies 
by 
which 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
is 
beset: 
the 
“caution” 
of 
which, 
he 
says, 
“doth 
extremely 
import 
the 
true 
conduct 
of 
human 
judgment.” 
These 
false 
appearances 
he 
describes, 
though 
he 
does 
not 
give 
their 
names; 
and 
they 
correspond 
respectively 
to 
what 
he 
afterwards 
called 
the 
Idols 
of 
the 
Tribe, 
the 
Cave, 
and 
the 
Forum. 
But 
he 
makes 
no 
mention 
of 
the 
fourth; 
namely, 
the 
Idols 
of 
the 
Theatre. 
Now 
in 
VALERIUS 
TERMINUS 
we 
find 
two 
separate 
passages 
in 
which 
the 
Idols 
are 
mentioned; 
and 
in 
both 
all 
four 
are 
enumerated, 
and 
all 
by 
name; 
though 
what 
he 
afterwards 
called 
Idols 
of 
the 
Forum, 
he 
there 
calls 
Idols 
of 
the 
Palace; 
and 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
very 
unlikely 
that, 
if 
when 
he 
wrote 
the 
ADVANCEMENT 
he 
had 
already 
formed 
that 
classification 
he 
should 
have 
omitted 
all 
mention 
of 
the 
Idols 
of 
the 
Theatre; 
for 
though 
it 
is 
true 
that 
that 
was 
not 
the 
place 
to 
discuss 
them, 
and 
therefore 
in 
the 
corresponding 
passage 
of 
the 
DE 
AUGMENTIS 
they 
are 
noticed 
as 
to 
be 
passed 
by 
“for 
the 
present,” 
yet 
they 
are 
noticed 
by 
name, 
and 
in 
all 
Bacon’s 
later 
writings 
the 
confutation 
of 
them 
holds 
a 
very 
prominent 
place. 


To 
me 
the 
most 
probable 
explanation 
of 
the 
fact 
is 
this. 
I 
have 
already 
shown 
that 
between 
the 
composition 
and 
the 
transcription 
of 
these 
fragments 
the 
design 
of 
the 
work 
appears 
to 
have 
undergone 
a 
considerable 



change; 
the 
order 
of 
the 
chapters 
being 
entirely 
altered. 
We 
have 
only 
to 
suppose 
therefore 
that 
they 
were 
composed 
before 
the 
ADVANCEMENT 
and 
transcribed 
after, 
and 
that 
in 
preparing 
them 
for 
the 
transcriber 
Bacon 
made 
the 
same 
kind 
of 
alterations 
in 
the 
originals 
which 
he 
afterwards 
made 
upon 
the 
transcript, 
and 
the 
difficulty 
disappears. 
Nothing 
would 
be 
easier 
than 
to 
correct 
“three” 
into 
“four,” 
and 
insert 
“the 
Idols 
of 
the 
Theatre” 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
sentence. 


And 
this 
reminds 
me 
(since 
I 
shall 
have 
so 
much 
to 
do 
with 
these 
questions 
of 
date) 
to 
suggest 
a 
general 
caution 
with 
regard 
to 
them 
all; 
namely, 
that 
in 
the 
case 
of 
fragments 
like 
these, 
the 
comparison 
of 
isolated 
passages 
can 
hardly 
ever 
be 
relied 
upon 
for 
evidence 
of 
the 
date 
or 
order 
of 
composition, 
or 
of 
the 
progressive 
developement 
of 
the 
writer’s 
views; 
and 
for 
this 
simple 
reason,— 
we 
can 
never 
be 
sure 
that 
the 
passages 
as 
they 
now 
stand 
formed 
part 
of 
the 
original 
writing. 
The 
copy 
of 
the 
fragment 
which 
we 
have 
may 
be 
(as 
there 
is 
reason 
to 
believe 
this 
was) 
a 
transcript 
from 
several 
loose 
papers, 
written 
at 
different 
periods 
and 
containing 
alterations 
or 
additions 
made 
from 
time 
to 
time. 
We 
may 
know 
perhaps 
that 
when 
Bacon 
published 
the 
ADVANCEMCNT 
OF 
LEARNING 
he 
was 
ignorant 
of 
some 
fact 
with 
which 
he 
afterwards 
became 
acquainted; 
we 
may 
find 
in 
one 
of 
these 
fragments,— 
say 
the 
TEMPORIS 
PARTUS 
MASCULUS,— 
a 
passage 
implying 
acquaintance 
with 
that 
fact. 
Does 
it 
follow 
that 
the 
TEMPORIS 
PARTUS 
MASCULUS 
was 
written 
after 
the 
ADVANCEMENT 
OF 
LEARNING? 
No; 
for 
in 
looking 
over 
the 
manuscript 
long 
after 
it 
was 
written, 
he 
may 
have 
observed 
and 
corrected 
the 
error. 
And 
we 
cannot 
conclude 
that 
he 
at 
the 
same 
time 
altered 
the 
whole 
composition 
so 
as 
to 
bring 
it 
into 
accordance 
with 
the 
views 
he 
then 
held; 
for 
that 
might 
be 
too 
long 
a 
work. 
He 
may 
have 
inserted 
a 
particular 
correction, 
but 
meant 
to 
rewrite 
the 
whole; 
and 
if 
so, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
later 
date 
indicated 
by 
that 
particular 
passage, 
the 
body 
of 
the 
work 
would 
still 
represent 
a 
stage 
in 
his 
opinions 
anterior 
to 
the 
ADVANCEMENT 
OF 
LEARNING. 


I 
have 
felt 
some 
doubt 
whether 
in 
printing 
this 
fragment, 
I 
should 
follow 
the 
example 
of 
Stephens, 
who 
gave 
it 
exactly 
as 
he 
found 
it; 
or 
that 
of 
later 
editors, 
who 
have 
altered 
the 
order 
of 
the 
chapters 
so 
as 
to 
make 
it 
agree 
with 
the 
numbers. 
The 
latter 
plan 
will 
perhaps, 
upon 
the 
whole, 
be 
the 
more 
convenient. 
There 
can 
he 
little 
doubt 
that 
the 
numbers 
of 
the 
chapters 
indicate 
the 
order 
in 
which 
Bacon 
meant 
them 
to 
be 
read; 
and 
if 
any 
one 
wishes 
to 



compare 
it 
with 
the 
order 
in 
which 
they 
seem 
to 
have 
been 
written, 
he 
has 
only 
to 
look 
at 
Bacon’s 
table 
of 
contents, 
which 
was 
made 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
transcript,

I

Cap. 
1. 


Of 
the 
Limits 
and 
End 
of 
Knowledge. 


In 
the 
divine 
nature 
both 
religion 
and 
philosophy 
hath 
acknowledged 
goodness 
in 
perfection, 
science 
or 
providence 
comprehending 
all 
things, 
and 
absolute 
sovereignty 
or 
kingdom. 
In 
aspiring 
to 
the 
throne 
of 
power 
the 
angels 
transgressed 
and 
fell, 
in 
presuming 
to 
come 
within 
the 
oracle 
of 
knowledge 
man 
transgressed 
and 
fell; 
but 
in 
pursuit 
towards 
the 
similitude 
of 
God’s 
goodness 
or 
love 
(which 
is 
one 
thing, 
for 
love 
is 
nothing 
else 
but 
goodness 
put 
in 
motion 
or 
applied) 
neither 
man 
or 
spirit 
ever 
hath 
transgressed, 
or 
shall 
transgress. 


The 
angel 
of 
light 
that 
was, 
when 
he 
presumed 
before 
his 
fall, 
said 
within 
himself, 
I 
WILL 
ASCEND 
AND 
BE 
LIKE 
UNTO 
THE 
HIGHEST; 
not 
God, 
but 
the 
highest. 
To 
be 
like 
to 
God 
in 
goodness, 
was 
no 
part 
of 
his 
emulation; 
knowledge, 
being 
in 
creation 
an 
angel 
of 
light, 
was 
not 
the 
want 
which 
did 
most 
solicit 
him; 
only 
because 
he 
was 
a 
minister 
he 
aimed 
at 
a 
supremacy; 
therefore 
his 
climbing 
or 
ascension 
was 
turned 
into 
a 
throwing 
down 
or 
precipitation. 


Man 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
when 
he 
was 
tempted 
before 
he 
fell, 
had 
offered 
unto 
him 
this 
suggestion, 
THAT 
HE 
SHOULD 
BE 
LIKE 
UNTO 
GOD. 
But 
how? 
Not 
simply, 
but 
in 
this 
part, 
KNOWING 
GOOD 
AND 
EVIL. 
For 
being 
in 
his 
creation 
invested 
with 
sovereignty 
of 
all 
inferior 
creatures, 
he 
was 
not 
needy 
of 
power 
or 
dominion; 
but 
again, 
being 
a 
spirit 
newly 
inclosed 
in 
a 
body 
of 
earth, 
he 
was 
fittest 
to 
be 
allured 
with 
appetite 
of 
light 
and 
liberty 
of 
knowledge; 
therefore 
this 
approaching 
and 
intruding 
into 
God’s 
secrets 
and 
mysteries 
was 
rewarded 
with 
a 
further 
removing 
and 
estranging 
from 
God’s 
presence. 
But 
as 
to 
the 
goodness 
of 
God, 
there 
is 
no 
danger 
in 
contending 
or 
advancing 
towards 
a 
similitude 
thereof, 
as 
that 
which 
is 
open 
and 
propounded 
to 
our 
imitation. 
For 
that 
voice 
(whereof 
the 
heathen 
and 
all 
other 
errors 
of 
religion 
have 
ever 
confessed 
that 
it 
sounds 
not 
like 
man), 
LOVE 
YOUR 
ENEMIES; 
BE 
YOU 
LIKE 
UNTO 
YOUR 



HEAVENLY 
FATHER, 
THAT 
SUFFERETH 
HIS 
RAIN 
TO 
FALL 
BOTH 
UPON 
THE 
JUST 
AND 
THE 
UNJUST, 
doth 
well 
declare, 
that 
we 
can 
in 
that 
point 
commit 
no 
excess; 
so 
again 
we 
find 
it 
often 
repeated 
in 
the 
old 
law, 
BE 
YOU 
HOLY 
AS 
I 
AM 
HOLY; 
and 
what 
is 
holiness 
else 
but 
goodness, 
as 
we 
consider 
it 
separate 
and 
guarded 
from 
all 
mixture 
and 
all 
access 
of 
evil? 


Wherefore 
seeing 
that 
knowledge 
is 
of 
the 
number 
of 
those 
things 
which 
are 
to 
be 
accepted 
of 
with 
caution 
and 
distinction; 
being 
now 
to 
open 
a 
fountain, 
such 
as 
it 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
discern 
where 
the 
issues 
and 
streams 
thereof 
will 
take 
and 
fall; 
I 
thought 
it 
good 
and 
necessary 
in 
the 
first 
place 
to 
make 
a 
strong 
and 
sound 
head 
or 
bank 
to 
rule 
and 
guide 
the 
course 
of 
the 
waters; 
by 
setting 
down 
this 
position 
or 
firmament, 
namely, 
THAT 
ALL 
KNOWLEDGE 
IS 
TO 
BE 
LIMITED 
BY 
RELIGION, 
AND 
TO 
BE 
REFERRED 
TO 
USE 
AND 
ACTION. 


For 
if 
any 
man 
shall 
think 
by 
view 
and 
inquiry 
into 
these 
sensible 
and 
material 
things, 
to 
attain 
to 
any 
light 
for 
the 
revealing 
of 
the 
nature 
or 
will 
of 
God, 
he 
shall 
dangerously 
abuse 
himself. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
contemplation 
of 
the 
creatures 
of 
God 
hath 
for 
end 
(as 
to 
the 
natures 
of 
the 
creatures 
themselves) 
knowledge, 
but 
as 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
God, 
no 
knowledge, 
but 
wonder; 
which 
is 
nothing 
else 
but 
contemplation 
broken 
off; 
or 
losing 
itself. 
Nay 
further, 
as 
it 
was 
aptly 
said 
by 
one 
of 
Plato’s 
school 
THE 
SENSE 
OF 
MAN 
RESEMBLES 
THE 
SUN, 
WHICH 
OPENETH 
AND 
REVEALETH 
THE 
TERRESTRIAL 
GLOBE, 
BUT 
OBSCURETH 
AND 
CONCEALETH 
THE 
CELESTIAL; 
so 
doth 
the 
sense 
discover 
natural 
things, 
but 
darken 
and 
shut 
up 
divine. 
And 
this 
appeareth 
sufficiently 
in 
that 
there 
is 
no 
proceeding 
in 
invention 
of 
knowledge 
but 
by 
similitude; 
and 
God 
is 
only 
self-like, 
having 
nothing 
in 
common 
with 
any 
creature, 
otherwise 
than 
as 
in 
shadow 
and 
trope. 
Therefore 
attend 
his 
will 
as 
himself 
openeth 
it, 
and 
give 
unto 
faith 
that 
which 
unto 
faith 
belongeth; 
for 
more 
worthy 
it 
is 
to 
believe 
than 
to 
think 
or 
know, 
considering 
that 
in 
knowledge 
(as 
we 
now 
are 
capable 
of 
it) 
the 
mind 
suffereth 
from 
inferior 
natures; 
but 
in 
all 
belief 
it 
suffereth 
from 
a 
spirit 
which 
it 
holdeth 
superior 
and 
more 
authorised 
than 
itself. 


To 
conclude, 
the 
prejudice 
hath 
been 
infinite 
that 
both 
divine 
and 
human 
knowledge 
hath 
received 
by 
the 
intermingling 
and 
tempering 
of 
the 
one 
with 
the 
other; 
as 
that 
which 
hath 
filled 
the 
one 
full 
of 
heresies, 
and 
the 
other 
full 
of 
speculative 
fictions 
and 
vanities. 



But 
now 
there 
are 
again 
which 
in 
a 
contrary 
extremity 
to 
those 
which 
give 
to 
contemplation 
an 
overlarge 
scope, 
do 
offer 
too 
great 
a 
restraint 
to 
natural 
and 
lawful 
knowledge, 
being 
unjustly 
jealous 
that 
every 
reach 
and 
depth 
of 
knowledge 
wherewith 
their 
conceits 
have 
not 
been 
acquainted, 
should 
be 
too 
high 
an 
elevation 
of 
man’s 
wit, 
and 
a 
searching 
and 
ravelling 
too 
far 
into 
God’s 
secrets; 
an 
opinion 
that 
ariseth 
either 
of 
envy 
(which 
is 
proud 
weakness 
and 
to 
be 
censured 
and 
not 
confuted), 
or 
else 
of 
a 
deceitful 
simplicity. 
For 
if 
they 
mean 
that 
the 
ignorance 
of 
a 
second 
cause 
doth 
make 
men 
more 
devoutly 
to 
depend 
upon 
the 
providence 
of 
God, 
as 
supposing 
the 
effects 
to 
come 
immediately 
from 
his 
hand, 
I 
demand 
of 
them, 
as 
Job 
demanded 
of 
his 
friends, 
WILL 
YOU 
LIE 
FOR 
GOD 
AS 
MAN 
WILL 
FOR 
MAN 
TO 
GRATIFY 
HIM? 
But 
if 
any 
man 
without 
any 
sinister 
humour 
doth 
indeed 
make 
doubt 
that 
this 
digging 
further 
and 
further 
into 
the 
mine 
of 
natural 
knowledge 
is 
a 
thing 
without 
example 
and 
uncommended 
in 
the 
Scriptures, 
or 
fruitless; 
let 
him 
remember 
and 
be 
instructed; 
for 
behold 
it 
was 
not 
that 
pure 
light 
of 
natural 
knowledge, 
whereby 
man 
in 
paradise 
was 
able 
to 
give 
unto 
every 
living 
creature 
a 
name 
according 
to 
his 
propriety, 
which 
gave 
occasion 
to 
the 
fall; 
but 
it 
was 
an 
aspiring 
desire 
to 
attain 
to 
that 
part 
of 
moral 
knowledge 
which 
defineth 
of 
good 
and 
evil, 
whereby 
to 
dispute 
God’s 
commandments 
and 
not 
to 
depend 
upon 
the 
revelation 
of 
his 
will, 
which 
was 
the 
original 
temptation. 
And 
the 
first 
holy 
records, 
which 
within 
those 
brief 
memorials 
of 
things 
which 
passed 
before 
the 
flood 
entered 
few 
things 
as 
worthy 
to 
be 
registered 
but 
only 
lineages 
and 
propagations, 
yet 
nevertheless 
honour 
the 
remembrance 
of 
the 
inventor 
both 
of 
music 
and 
works 
in 
metal. 
Moses 
again 
(who 
was 
the 
reporter) 
is 
said 
to 
have 
been 
seen 
in 
all 
the 
Egyptian 
learning, 
which 
nation 
was 
early 
and 
leading 
in 
matter 
of 
knowledge. 
And 
Salomon 
the 
king, 
as 
out 
of 
a 
branch 
of 
his 
wisdom 
extraordinarily 
petitioned 
and 
granted 
from 
God, 
is 
said 
to 
have 
written 
a 
natural 
history 
of 
all 
that 
is 
green 
from 
the 
cedar 
to 
the 
moss, 
(which 
is 
but 
a 
rudiment 
between 
putrefaction 
and 
an 
herb,) 
and 
also 
of 
all 
that 
liveth 
and 
moveth. 
And 
if 
the 
book 
of 
Job 
be 
turned 
over, 
it 
will 
be 
found 
to 
have 
much 
aspersion 
of 
natural 
philosophy. 
Nay, 
the 
same 
Salomon 
the 
king 
affirmeth 
directly 
that 
the 
glory 
of 
God 
IS 
TO 
CONCEAL 
A 
THING, 
BUT 
THE 
GLORY 
OF 
THE 
KING 
IS 
TO 
FIND 
IT 
OUT, 
as 
if 
according 
to 
the 
innocent 
play 
of 
children 
the 
divine 
Majesty 
took 
delight 
to 
hide 
his 
works, 
to 
the 
end 
to 
have 
them 
found 
out; 
for 
in 
naming 
the 
king 
he 
intendeth 
man, 
taking 
such 
a 
condition 
of 
man 
as 
hath 
most 
excellency 
and 
greatest 



commandment 
of 
wits 
and 
means, 
alluding 
also 
to 
his 
own 
person, 
being 
truly 
one 
of 
those 
clearest 
burning 
lamps, 
whereof 
himself 
speaketh 
in 
another 
place, 
when 
he 
saith 
THE 
SPIRIT 
OF 
MAN 
IS 
AS 
THE 
LAMB, 
OF 
GOD, 
WHEREWITH 
HE 
SEARCHETH 
ALL 
INWARDNESS; 
which 
nature 
of 
the 
soul 
the 
same 
Salomon 
holding 
precious 
and 
inestimable, 
and 
therein 
conspiring 
with 
the 
affection 
of 
Socrates 
who 
scorned 
the 
pretended 
learned 
men 
of 
his 
time 
for 
raising 
great 
benefit 
of 
their 
learning 
(whereas 
Anaxagoras 
contrariwise 
and 
divers 
others 
being 
born 
to 
ample 
patrimonies 
decayed 
them 
in 
contemplation), 
delivereth 
it 
in 
precept 
yet 
remaining, 
BUY 
THE 
TRUTH, 
AND 
SELL 
IT 
NOT; 
AND 
SO 
OF 
WISDOM 
AND 
KNOWLEDGE. 


And 
lest 
any 
man 
should 
retain 
a 
scruple 
as 
if 
this 
thirst 
of 
knowledge 
were 
rather 
an 
humour 
of 
the 
mind 
than 
an 
emptiness 
or 
want 
in 
nature 
and 
an 
instinct 
from 
God, 
the 
same 
author 
defineth 
of 
it 
fully, 
saying, 
GOD 
HATH 
MADE 
EVERY 
THING 
IN 
BEAUTY 
ACCORDING 
TO 
SEASON; 
ALSO 
HE 
HATH 
SET 
THE 
WORLD 
IN 
MAN’S 
HEART, 
YET 
CAN 
HE 
NOT 
FIND 
OUT 
THE 
WORK 
WHICH 
GOD 
WORKETH 
FROM 
THE 
BEGINNING 
TO 
THE 
END: 
declaring 
not 
obscurely 
that 
God 
hath 
framed 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
as 
a 
glass 
capable 
of 
the 
image 
of 
the 
universal 
world, 
joying 
to 
receive 
the 
signature 
thereof 
as 
the 
eye 
is 
of 
light, 
yea 
not 
only 
satisfied 
in 
beholding 
the 
variety 
of 
things 
and 
vicissitude 
of 
times, 
but 
raised 
also 
to 
find 
out 
and 
discern 
those 
ordinances 
and 
decrees 
which 
throughout 
all 
these 
changes 
are 
infallibly 
observed. 
And 
although 
the 
highest 
generality 
of 
motion 
or 
summary 
law 
of 
nature 
God 
should 
still 
reserve 
within 
his 
own 
curtain, 
yet 
many 
and 
noble 
are 
the 
inferior 
and 
secondary 
operations 
which 
are 
within 
man’s 
sounding. 
This 
is 
a 
thing 
which 
I 
cannot 
tell 
whether 
I 
may 
so 
plainly 
speak 
as 
truly 
conceive, 
that 
as 
all 
knowledge 
appeareth 
to 
be 
a 
plant 
of 
God’s 
own 
planting, 
so 
it 
may 
seem 
the 
spreading 
and 
flourishing 
or 
at 
least 
the 
bearing 
and 
fructifying 
of 
this 
plant, 
by 
a 
providence 
of 
God, 
nay 
not 
only 
by 
a 
general 
providence 
but 
by 
a 
special 
prophecy, 
was 
appointed 
to 
this 
autumn 
of 
the 
world: 
for 
to 
my 
understanding 
it 
is 
not 
violent 
to 
the 
letter, 
and 
safe 
now 
after 
the 
event, 
so 
to 
interpret 
that 
place 
in 
the 
prophecy 
of 
Daniel 
where 
speaking 
of 
the 
latter 
times 
it 
is 
said, 
MANY 
SHALL 
PASS 
TO 
AND 
FRO, 
AND 
SCIENCE 
SHALL 
BE 
INCREASED; 
as 
if 
the 
opening 
of 
the 
world 
by 
navigation 
and 
commerce 
and 
the 
further 
discovery 
of 
knowledge 
should 
meet 
in 
one 
time 
or 
age. 



But 
howsoever 
that 
be, 
there 
are 
besides 
the 
authorities 
of 
Scriptures 
before 
recited, 
two 
reasons 
of 
exceeding 
great 
weight 
and 
force 
why 
religion 
should 
dearly 
protect 
all 
increase 
of 
natural 
knowledge: 
the 
one, 
because 
it 
leadeth 
to 
the 
greater 
exaltation 
of 
the 
glory 
of 
God; 
for 
as 
the 
Psalms 
and 
other 
Scriptures 
do 
often 
invite 
us 
to 
consider 
and 
to 
magnify 
the 
great 
and 
wonderful 
works 
of 
God, 
so 
if 
we 
should 
rest 
only 
in 
the 
contemplation 
of 
those 
shews 
which 
first 
offer 
themselves 
to 
our 
senses, 
we 
should 
do 
a 
like 
injury 
to 
the 
majesty 
of 
God, 
as 
if 
we 
should 
judge 
of 
the 
store 
of 
some 
excellent 
jeweler 
by 
that 
only 
which 
is 
set 
out 
to 
the 
street 
in 
his 
shop. 
The 
other 
reason 
is, 
because 
it 
is 
a 
singular 
help 
and 
a 
preservative 
against 
unbelief 
and 
error; 
for, 
saith 
our 
Saviour, 
YOU 
ERR, 
NOT 
KNOWING 
THE 
SCRIPTURES 
NOR 
THE 
POWER 
OF 
GOD; 
laying 
before 
us 
two 
books 
or 
volumes 
to 
study 
if 
we 
will 
be 
secured 
from 
error; 
first 
the 
Scriptures 
revealing 
the 
will 
of 
God, 
and 
then 
the 
creatures 
expressing 
his 
power; 
for 
that 
latter 
book 
will 
certify 
us 
that 
nothing 
which 
the 
first 
teacheth 
shall 
be 
thought 
impossible. 
And 
most 
sure 
it 
is, 
and 
a 
true 
conclusion 
of 
experience, 
that 
a 
little 
natural 
philosophy 
inclineth 
the 
mind 
to 
atheism, 
but 
a 
further 
proceeding 
bringeth 
the 
mind 
back 
to 
religion. 


To 
conclude 
then, 
let 
no 
man 
presume 
to 
check 
the 
liberality 
of 
God’s 
gifts, 
who, 
as 
was 
said, 
HATH 
SET 
THE 
WORLD 
IN 
MAN’S 
HEART. 
So 
as 
whatsoever 
is 
not 
God 
but 
parcel 
of 
the 
world, 
he 
hath 
fitted 
it 
to 
the 
comprehension 
of 
man’s 
mind, 
if 
man 
will 
open 
and 
dilate 
the 
powers 
of 
his 
understanding 
as 
he 
may. 


But 
yet 
evermore 
it 
must 
be 
remembered 
that 
the 
least 
part 
of 
knowledge 
passed 
to 
man 
by 
this 
so 
large 
a 
charter 
from 
God 
must 
be 
subject 
to 
that 
use 
for 
which 
God 
hath 
granted 
it; 
which 
is 
the 
benefit 
and 
relief 
of 
the 
state 
and 
society 
of 
man; 
for 
otherwise 
all 
manner 
of 
knowledge 
becometh 
malign 
and 
serpentine, 
and 
therefore 
as 
carrying 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
serpent’s 
sting 
and 
malice 
it 
maketh 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
to 
swell; 
as 
the 
Scripture 
saith 
excellently, 
knowledge 
bloweth 
up, 
but 
charity 
buildeth 
up. 
And 
again 
the 
same 
author 
doth 
notably 
disavow 
both 
power 
and 
knowledge 
such 
as 
is 
not 
dedicated 
to 
goodness 
or 
love, 
for 
saith 
he, 
IF 
I 
HAVE 
ALL 
FAITH 
SO 
AS 
I 
COULD 
REMOVE 
MOUNTAINS, 
(there 
is 
power 
active,) 
IF 
I 
RENDER 
MY 
BODY 
TO 
THE 
FIRE, 
(there 
is 
power 
passive,) 
IF 
I 
SPEAK 
WITH 
THE 
TONGUES 
OF 
MEN 
AND 
ANGELS, 
(there 
is 
knowledge, 
for 
language 
is 
but 
the 
conveyance 
of 
knowledge,) 
ALL 
WERE 



NOTHING. 


And 
therefore 
it 
is 
not 
the 
pleasure 
of 
curiosity, 
nor 
the 
quiet 
of 
resolution, 
nor 
the 
raising 
of 
the 
spirit, 
nor 
victory 
of 
wit, 
nor 
faculty 
of 
speech, 
nor 
lucre 
of 
profession, 
nor 
ambition 
of 
honour 
or 
fame, 
nor 
inablement 
for 
business, 
that 
are 
the 
true 
ends 
of 
knowledge; 
some 
of 
these 
being 
more 
worthy 
than 
other, 
though 
all 
inferior 
and 
degenerate: 
but 
it 
is 
a 
restitution 
and 
reinvesting 
(in 
great 
part) 
of 
man 
to 
the 
sovereignty 
and 
power 
(for 
whensoever 
he 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
call 
the 
creatures 
by 
their 
true 
names 
he 
shall 
again 
command 
them) 
which 
he 
had 
in 
his 
first 
state 
of 
creation. 
And 
to 
speak 
plainly 
and 
clearly, 
it 
is 
a 
discovery 
of 
all 
operations 
and 
possibilities 
of 
operations 
from 
immortality 
(if 
it 
were 
possible) 
to 
the 
meanest 
mechanical 
practice. 
And 
therefore 
knowledge 
that 
tendeth 
but 
to 
satisfaction 
is 
but 
as 
a 
courtesan, 
which 
is 
for 
pleasure 
and 
not 
for 
fruit 
or 
generation. 
And 
knowledge 
that 
tendeth 
to 
profit 
or 
profession 
or 
glory 
is 
but 
as 
the 
golden 
ball 
thrown 
before 
Atalanta, 
which 
while 
she 
goeth 
aside 
and 
stoopeth 
to 
take 
up 
she 
hindereth 
the 
race. 
And 
knowledge 
referred 
to 
some 
particular 
point 
of 
use 
is 
but 
as 
Harmodius 
which 
putteth 
down 
one 
tyrant, 
and 
not 
like 
Hercules 
who 
did 
perambulate 
the 
world 
to 
suppress 
tyrants 
and 
giants 
and 
monsters 
in 
every 
part. 
It 
is 
true, 
that 
in 
two 
points 
the 
curse 
is 
peremptory 
and 
not 
to 
be 
removed; 
the 
one 
that 
vanity 
must 
be 
the 
end 
in 
all 
human 
effects, 
eternity 
being 
resumed, 
though 
the 
revolutions 
and 
periods 
may 
be 
delayed. 
The 
other 
that 
the 
consent 
of 
the 
creature 
being 
now 
turned 
into 
reluctation, 
this 
power 
cannot 
otherwise 
be 
exercised 
and 
administered 
but 
with 
labour, 
as 
well 
in 
inventing 
as 
in 
executing; 
yet 
nevertheless 
chiefly 
that 
labour 
and 
travel 
which 
is 
described 
by 
the 
sweat 
of 
the 
brows 
more 
than 
of 
the 
body; 
that 
is 
such 
travel 
as 
is 
joined 
with 
the 
working 
and 
discursion 
of 
the 
spirits 
in 
the 
brain: 
for 
as 
Salomon 
saith 
excellently, 
THE 
FOOL 
PUTTETH 
TO 
MORE 
STRENGTH, 
BUT 
THE 
WISE 
MAN 
CONSIDERETH 
WHICH 
WAY, 
signifying 
the 
election 
of 
the 
mean 
to 
be 
more 
material 
than 
the 
multiplication 
of 
endeavour. 
It 
is 
true 
also 
that 
there 
is 
a 
limitation 
rather 
potential 
than 
actual, 
which 
is 
when 
the 
effect 
is 
possible, 
but 
the 
time 
or 
place 
yieldeth 
not 
the 
matter 
or 
basis 
whereupon 
man 
should 
work. 
But 
notwithstanding 
these 
precincts 
and 
bounds, 
let 
it 
be 
believed, 
and 
appeal 
thereof 
made 
to 
Time, 
(with 
renunciation 
nevertheless 
to 
all 
the 
vain 
and 
abusing 
promises 
of 
Alchemists 
and 
Magicians, 
and 
such 
like 
light, 
idle, 
ignorant, 
credulous, 
and 
fantastical 
wits 
and 
sects,) 
that 
the 
new-found 
world 
of 
land 
was 
not 
greater 
addition 
to 
the 
ancient 
continent 
than 
there 
remaineth 



at 
this 
day 
a 
world 
of 
inventions 
and 
sciences 
unknown, 
having 
respect 
to 
those 
that 
are 
known, 
with 
this 
difference 
that 
the 
ancient 
regions 
of 
knowledge 
will 
seem 
as 
barbarous 
compared 
with 
the 
new, 
as 
the 
new 
regions 
of 
people 
seem 
barbarous 
compared 
to 
many 
of 
the 
old. 


The 
dignity 
of 
this 
end 
(of 
endowment 
of 
man’s 
life 
with 
new 
commodities) 
appeareth 
by 
the 
estimation 
that 
antiquity 
made 
of 
such 
as 
guided 
thereunto. 
For 
whereas 
founders 
of 
states, 
lawgivers, 
extirpers 
of 
tyrants, 
fathers 
of 
the 
people, 
were 
honoured 
but 
with 
the 
titles 
of 
Worthies 
or 
Demigods, 
inventors 
were 
ever 
consecrated 
amongst 
the 
Gods 
themselves. 
And 
if 
the 
ordinary 
ambitions 
of 
men 
lead 
them 
to 
seek 
the 
amplification 
of 
their 
own 
power 
in 
their 
countries, 
and 
a 
better 
ambition 
than 
that 
hath 
moved 
men 
to 
seek 
the 
amplification 
of 
the 
power 
of 
their 
own 
countries 
amongst 
other 
nations, 
better 
again 
and 
more 
worthy 
must 
that 
aspiring 
be 
which 
seeketh 
the 
amplification 
of 
the 
power 
and 
kingdom 
of 
mankind 
over 
the 
world; 
the 
rather 
because 
the 
other 
two 
prosecutions 
are 
ever 
culpable 
of 
much 
perturbation 
and 
injustice; 
but 
this 
is 
a 
work 
truly 
divine, 
which 
cometh 
IN 
AURA 
LENI 
without 
noise 
or 
observation. 


The 
access 
also 
to 
this 
work 
hath 
been 
by 
that 
port 
or 
passage, 
which 
the 
divine 
Majesty 
(who 
is 
unchangeabIe 
in 
his 
ways) 
doth 
infallibly 
continue 
and 
observe; 
that 
is 
the 
felicity 
wherewith 
he 
hath 
blessed 
an 
humility 
of 
mind, 
such 
as 
rather 
laboureth 
to 
spell 
and 
so 
by 
degrees 
to 
read 
in 
the 
volumes 
of 
his 
creatures, 
than 
to 
solicit 
and 
urge 
and 
as 
it 
were 
to 
invocate 
a 
man’s 
own 
spirit 
to 
divine 
and 
give 
oracles 
unto 
him. 
For 
as 
in 
the 
inquiry 
of 
divine 
truth, 
the 
pride 
of 
man 
hath 
ever 
inclined 
to 
leave 
the 
oracles 
of 
God’s 
word 
and 
to 
vanish 
in 
the 
mixture 
of 
their 
own 
inventions; 
so 
in 
the 
self-same 
manner, 
in 
inquisition 
of 
nature 
they 
have 
ever 
left 
the 
oracles 
of 
God’s 
works, 
and 
adored 
the 
deceiving 
and 
deformed 
imagery 
which 
the 
unequal 
mirrors 
of 
their 
own 
minds 
have 
represented 
unto 
them. 
Nay 
it 
is 
a 
point 
fit 
and 
necessary 
in 
the 
front 
and 
beginning 
of 
this 
work 
without 
hesitation 
or 
reservation 
to 
be 
professed, 
that 
it 
is 
no 
less 
true 
in 
this 
human 
kingdom 
of 
knowledge 
than 
in 
God’s 
kingdom 
of 
heaven, 
that 
no 
man 
shall 
enter 
into 
it 
EXCEPT 
HE 
BECOME 
FIRST 
AS 
A 
LITTLE 
CHILD. 



Cap. 
4. 


Of 
the 
Impediments 
of 
Knowledge, 
Being 
the 
4th 
Chapter, 
the 
Preface 
Only 
of 
it. 


In 
some 
things 
it 
is 
more 
hard 
to 
attempt 
than 
to 
achieve, 
which 
falleth 
out 
when 
the 
difficulty 
is 
not 
so 
much 
in 
the 
matter 
or 
subject, 
as 
it 
is 
in 
the 
crossness 
and 
indisposition 
of 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
to 
think 
of 
any 
such 
thing, 
to 
will 
or 
to 
resolve 
it. 
And 
therefore 
Titus 
Livius 
in 
his 
declamatory 
digression 
wherein 
he 
doth 
depress 
and 
extenuate 
the 
honour 
of 
Alexander’s 
conquests 
saith, 
NIHIL 
ALIUD 
QUAM 
BENE 
AUSUS 
VANA 
CONTEMNERE: 
in 
which 
sort 
of 
things 
it 
is 
the 
manner 
of 
men 
first 
to 
wonder 
that 
any 
such 
thing 
should 
be 
possible, 
and 
after 
it 
is 
found 
out 
to 
wonder 
again 
how 
the 
world 
should 
miss 
it 
so 
long. 
Of 
this 
nature 
I 
take 
to 
be 
the 
invention 
and 
discovery 
of 
knowledge, 
etc. 


THE 
IMPEDIMENTS 
WHICH 
HAVE 
BEEN 
IN 
THE 
TIMES, 
AND 
IN 
DIVERSION 
OF 
WITS, 
BEING 
THE 
5TH 
CHAPTER, 
A 
SMALL 
FRAGMENT 
IN 
THE 
BEGINNING 
OF 
THAT 
CHAPTER. 


The 
encounters 
of 
the 
times 
have 
been 
nothing 
favourable 
and 
prosperous 
for 
the 
invention 
of 
knowledge; 
so 
as 
it 
is 
not 
only 
the 
daintiness 
of 
the 
seed 
to 
take, 
and 
the 
ill 
mixture 
and 
unliking 
of 
the 
ground 
to 
nourish 
or 
raise 
this 
plant, 
but 
the 
ill 
season 
also 
of 
the 
weather 
by 
which 
it 
hath 
been 
checked 
and 
blasted. 
Especially 
in 
that 
the 
seasons 
have 
been 
proper 
to 
bring 
up 
and 
set 
forward 
other 
more 
hasty 
and 
indifferent 
plants, 
whereby 
this 
of 
knowledge 
bath 
been 
starved 
and 
overgrown; 
for 
in 
the 
descent 
of 
times 
always 
there 
hath 
been 
somewhat 
else 
in 
reign 
and 
reputation, 
which 
hath 
generally 
aliened 
and 
diverted 
wits 
and 
labours 
from 
that 
employment. 


For 
as 
for 
the 
uttermost 
antiquity 
which 
is 
like 
fame 
that 
muffles 
her 
head 
and 
tells 
tales, 
I 
cannot 
presume 
much 
of 
it; 
for 
I 
would 
not 
willingly 
imitate 
the 
manner 
of 
those 
that 
describe 
maps, 
which 
when 
they 
come 
to 
some 
far 
countries 
whereof 
they 
have 
no 
knowledge, 
set 
down 
how 
there 
be 



great 
wastes 
and 
deserts 
there: 
so 
I 
am 
not 
apt 
to 
affirm 
that 
they 
knew 
little, 
because 
what 
they 
knew 
is 
little 
known 
to 
us. 
But 
if 
you 
will 
judge 
of 
them 
by 
the 
last 
traces 
that 
remain 
to 
us, 
you 
will 
conclude, 
though 
not 
so 
scornfully 
as 
Aristotle 
doth, 
that 
saith 
our 
ancestors 
were 
extreme 
gross, 
as 
those 
that 
came 
newly 
from 
being 
moulded 
out 
of 
the 
clay 
or 
some 
earthly 
substance; 
yet 
reasonably 
and 
probably 
thus, 
that 
it 
was 
with 
them 
in 
matter 
of 
knowledge 
but 
as 
the 
dawning 
or 
break 
of 
day. 
For 
at 
that 
time 
the 
world 
was 
altogether 
home-bred, 
every 
nation 
looked 
little 
beyond 
their 
own 
confines 
or 
territories, 
and 
the 
world 
had 
no 
through 
lights 
then, 
as 
it 
hath 
had 
since 
by 
commerce 
and 
navigation, 
whereby 
there 
could 
neither 
be 
that 
contribution 
of 
wits 
one 
to 
help 
another, 
nor 
that 
variety 
of 
particulars 
for 
the 
correcting 
of 
customary 
conceits. 


And 
as 
there 
could 
be 
no 
great 
collection 
of 
wits 
of 
several 
parts 
or 
nations, 
so 
neither 
could 
there 
be 
any 
succession 
of 
wits 
of 
several 
times, 
whereby 
one 
might 
refine 
the 
other, 
in 
regard 
they 
had 
not 
history 
to 
any 
purpose. 
And 
the 
manner 
of 
their 
traditions 
was 
utterly 
unfit 
and 
unproper 
for 
amplification 
of 
knowledge. 
And 
again 
the 
studies 
of 
those 
times, 
you 
shall 
find, 
besides 
wars, 
incursions, 
and 
rapines, 
which 
were 
then 
almost 
every 
where 
betwixt 
states 
adjoining 
(the 
use 
of 
leagues 
and 
confederacies 
being 
not 
then 
known), 
were 
to 
populate 
by 
multitude 
of 
wives 
and 
generation, 
a 
thing 
at 
this 
day 
in 
the 
waster 
part 
of 
the 
West–Indies 
principally 
affected; 
and 
to 
build 
sometimes 
for 
habitation 
towns 
and 
cities, 
sometimes 
for 
fame 
and 
memory 
monuments, 
pyramids, 
colosses, 
and 
the 
like. 
And 
if 
there 
happened 
to 
rise 
up 
any 
more 
civil 
wits; 
then 
would 
he 
found 
and 
erect 
some 
new 
laws, 
customs, 
and 
usages, 
such 
as 
now 
of 
late 
years, 
when 
the 
world 
was 
revolute 
almost 
to 
the 
like 
rudeness 
and 
obscurity, 
we 
see 
both 
in 
our 
own 
nation 
and 
abroad 
many 
examples 
of, 
as 
well 
in 
a 
number 
of 
tenures 
reserved 
upon 
men’s 
lands, 
as 
in 
divers 
customs 
of 
towns 
and 
manors, 
being 
the 
devices 
that 
such 
wits 
wrought 
upon 
in 
such 
times 
of 
deep 
ignorance, 
etc. 


THE 
IMPEDIMENTS 
OF 
KNOWLEDGE 
FOR 
WANT 
OF 
A 
TRUE 
SUCCESSION 
OF 
WITS, 
AND 
THAT 
HITHERTO 
THE 
LENGTH 
OF 
ONE 
MAN’S 
LIFE 
HATH 
BEEN 
THE 
GREATEST 
MEASURE 
OF 
KNOWLEDGE, 
BEING 
THE 
6TH 
CHAPTER, 
THE 
WHOLE 
CHAPTER. 


In 
arts 
mechanical 
the 
first 
device 
comes 
shortest 
and 
time 
addeth 
and 
perfecteth. 
But 
in 
sciences 
of 
conceit 
the 
first 
author 
goeth 
furthest 
and 
time 
leeseth 
and 
corrupteth. 
Painting, 
artillery, 
sailing, 
and 
the 
like, 
grossly 



managed 
at 
first, 
by 
time 
accommodate 
and 
refined. 
The 
philosophies 
and 
sciences 
of 
Aristotle, 
Plato, 
Democritus, 
Hippocrates, 
of 
most 
vigour 
at 
first, 
by 
time 
degenerated 
and 
imbased. 
In 
the 
former 
many 
wits 
and 
industries 
contributed 
in 
one: 
In 
the 
latter 
many 
men’s 
wits 
spent 
to 
deprave 
the 
wit 
of 
one. 


The 
error 
is 
both 
in 
the 
deliverer 
and 
in 
the 
receiver. 
He 
that 
delivereth 
knowledge 
desireth 
to 
deliver 
it 
in 
such 
form 
as 
may 
be 
soonest 
believed, 
and 
not 
as 
may 
be 
easiliest 
examined. 
He 
that 
receiveth 
knowledge 
desireth 
rather 
present 
satisfaction 
than 
expectant 
search, 
and 
so 
rather 
not 
to 
doubt 
than 
not 
to 
err. 
Glory 
maketh 
the 
author 
not 
to 
lay 
open 
his 
weakness, 
and 
sloth 
maketh 
the 
disciple 
not 
to 
know 
his 
strength. 


Then 
begin 
men 
to 
aspire 
to 
the 
second 
prizes; 
to 
be 
a 
profound 
interpreter 
and 
commenter, 
to 
be 
a 
sharp 
champion 
and 
defender, 
to 
be 
a 
methodical 
compounder 
and 
abridger. 
And 
this 
is 
the 
unfortunate 
succession 
of 
wits 
which 
the 
world 
hath 
yet 
had, 
whereby 
the 
patrimony 
of 
all 
knowledge 
goeth 
not 
on 
husbanded 
or 
improved, 
but 
wasted 
and 
decayed. 
For 
knowledge 
is 
like 
a 
water 
that 
will 
never 
arise 
again 
higher 
than 
the 
level 
from 
which 
it 
fell; 
and 
therefore 
to 
go 
beyond 
Aristotle 
by 
the 
light 
of 
Aristotle 
is 
to 
think 
that 
a 
borrowed 
light 
can 
increase 
the 
original 
light 
from 
whom 
it 
is 
taken. 
So 
then 
no 
true 
succession 
of 
wits 
having 
been 
in 
the 
world, 
either 
we 
must 
conclude 
that 
knowledge 
is 
but 
a 
task 
for 
one 
man’s 
life, 
and 
then 
vain 
was 
the 
complaint 
that 
LIFE 
IS 
SHORT, 
AND 
ART 
IS 
LONG: 
or 
else, 
that 
the 
knowledge 
that 
now 
is, 
is 
but 
a 
shrub, 
and 
not 
that 
tree 
which 
is 
never 
dangerous, 
but 
where 
it 
is 
to 
the 
purpose 
of 
knowing 
Good 
and 
Evil; 
which 
desire 
ever 
riseth 
upon 
an 
appetite 
to 
elect 
and 
not 
to 
obey, 
and 
so 
containeth 
in 
it 
a 
manifest 
defection. 



Cap. 
7. 


That 
the 
Pretended 
Succession 
of 
Wits 
Hath 
Been 
Evil 
Placed, 
for 
Asmuch 
as 
After 
Variety 
of 
Sects 
and 
Opinions, 
the 
Most 
Popular 
and 
Not 
the 
Truest 
Prevaileth 
and 
Weareth 
Out 
the 
Rest; 
Being 
the 
7th 
Chapter; 
a 
Fragment. 


It 
is 
sensible 
to 
think 
that 
when 
men 
enter 
first 
into 
search 
and 
inquiry, 
according 
to 
the 
several 
frames 
and 
compositions 
of 
their 
understanding 
they 
light 
upon 
different 
conceits, 
and 
so 
all 
opinions 
and 
doubts 
are 
beaten 
over, 
and 
then 
men 
having 
made 
a 
taste 
of 
all 
wax 
weary 
of 
variety, 
and 
so 
reject 
the 
worst 
and 
hold 
themselves 
to 
the 
best, 
either 
some 
one 
if 
it 
be 
eminent, 
or 
some 
two 
or 
three 
if 
they 
be 
in 
some 
equality, 
which 
afterwards 
are 
received 
and 
carried 
on, 
and 
the 
rest 
extinct. 


But 
truth 
is 
contrary, 
and 
that 
time 
is 
like 
a 
river 
which 
carrieth 
down 
things 
which 
are 
light 
and 
blown 
up, 
and 
sinketh 
and 
drowneth 
that 
which 
is 
sad 
and 
weighty. 
For 
howsoever 
governments 
have 
several 
forms, 
sometimes 
one 
governing, 
sometimes 
few, 
sometimes 
the 
multitude; 
yet 
the 
state 
of 
knowledge 
is 
ever 
a 
DEMOCRATIE, 
and 
that 
prevaileth 
which 
is 
most 
agreeable 
to 
the 
senses 
and 
conceits 
of 
people. 
As 
for 
example 
there 
is 
no 
great 
doubt 
but 
he 
that 
did 
put 
the 
beginnings 
of 
things 
to 
be 
SOLID, 
VOID, 
AND 
MOTION 
TO 
THE 
CENTRE, 
was 
in 
better 
earnest 
than 
he 
that 
put 
MATTER, 
FORM, 
AND 
SHIFT; 
or 
he 
that 
put 
the 
MIND, 
MOTION, 
AND 
MATTER. 
For 
no 
man 
shall 
enter 
into 
inquisition 
of 
nature, 
but 
shall 
pass 
by 
that 
opinion 
of 
Democritus, 
whereas 
he 
shall 
never 
come 
near 
the 
other 
two 
opinions, 
but 
leave 
them 
aloof 
for 
the 
schools 
and 
table-talk. 
Yet 
those 
of 
Aristotle 
and 
Plato, 
because 
they 
be 
both 
agreeable 
to 
popular 
sense, 
and 
the 
one 
was 
uttered 
with 
subtilty 
and 
the 
spirit 
of 
contradiction, 
and 
the 
other 
with 
a 
stile 
of 
ornament 
and 
majesty, 
did 
hold 
out, 
and 
the 
other 
gave 
place, 
etc. 



Cap. 
8. 


Of 
the 
Impediments 
of 
Knowledge 
in 
Handling 
it 
by 
Parts, 
and 
in 
Slipping 
off 
Particular 
Sciences 
from 
the 
Root 
and 
Stock 
Of 
Universal 
Knowledge, 
Being 
the 
8th 
Chapter, 
the 
Whole 
Chapter. 


Cicero, 
the 
orator, 
willing 
to 
magnify 
his 
own 
profession, 
and 
thereupon 
spending 
many 
words 
to 
maintain 
that 
eloquence 
was 
not 
a 
shop 
of 
good 
words 
and 
elegancies 
but 
a 
treasury 
and 
receipt 
of 
all 
knowledges, 
so 
far 
forth 
as 
may 
appertain 
to 
the 
handling 
and 
moving 
of 
the 
minds 
and 
affections 
of 
men 
by 
speech, 
maketh 
great 
complaint 
of 
the 
school 
of 
Socrates; 
that 
whereas 
before 
his 
time 
the 
same 
professors 
of 
wisdom 
in 
Greece 
did 
pretend 
to 
teach 
an 
universal 
SAPIENCE 
and 
knowledge 
both 
of 
matter 
and 
words, 
Socrates 
divorced 
them 
and 
withdrew 
philosophy 
and 
left 
rhetoric 
to 
itself, 
which 
by 
that 
destitution 
became 
but 
a 
barren 
and 
unnoble 
science. 
And 
in 
particular 
sciences 
we 
see 
that 
if 
men 
fall 
to 
subdivide 
their 
labours, 
as 
to 
be 
an 
oculist 
in 
physic, 
or 
to 
be 
perfect 
in 
some 
one 
title 
of 
the 
law, 
or 
the 
like, 
they 
may 
prove 
ready 
and 
subtile, 
but 
not 
deep 
or 
sufficient, 
no 
not 
in 
that 
subject 
which 
they 
do 
particularly 
attend, 
because 
of 
that 
consent 
which 
it 
hath 
with 
the 
rest. 
And 
it 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
common 
discourse 
of 
the 
chain 
of 
sciences 
how 
they 
are 
linked 
together, 
insomuch 
as 
the 
Grecians, 
who 
had 
terms 
at 
will, 
have 
fitted 
it 
of 
a 
name 
of 
CIRCLE 
LEARNING. 
Nevertheless 
I 
that 
hold 
it 
for 
a 
great 
impediment 
towards 
the 
advancement 
and 
further 
invention 
of 
knowledge, 
that 
particular 
arts 
and 
sciences 
have 
been 
disincorporated 
from 
general 
knowledge, 
do 
not 
understand 
one 
and 
the 
same 
thing 
which 
Cicero’s 
discourse 
and 
the 
note 
and 
conceit 
of 
the 
Grecians 
in 
their 
word 
CIRCLE 
LEARNING 
do 
intend. 
For 
I 
mean 
not 
that 
use 
which 
one 
science 
hath 
of 
another 
for 
ornament 
or 
help 
in 
practice, 
as 
the 
orator 
hath 
of 
knowledge 
of 
affections 
for 
moving, 
or 
as 
military 
science 
may 
have 
use 
of 
geometry 
for 
fortifications; 
but 
I 
mean 
it 
directly 
of 
that 
use 
by 
way 
of 
supply 
of 
light 
and 
information 
which 
the 
particulars 
and 
instances 
of 
one 
science 
do 
yield 
and 
present 
for 
the 
framing 
or 
correcting 
of 
the 
axioms 
of 



another 
science 
in 
their 
very 
truth 
and 
notion. 
And 
therefore 
that 
example 
of 
OCULISTS 
and 
TITLE 
LAWYERS 
doth 
come 
nearer 
my 
conceit 
than 
the 
other 
two; 
for 
sciences 
distinguished 
have 
a 
dependence 
upon 
universal 
knowledge 
to 
be 
augmented 
and 
rectified 
by 
the 
superior 
light 
thereof, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
parts 
and 
members 
of 
a 
science 
have 
upon 
the 
MAXIMS 
of 
the 
same 
science, 
and 
the 
mutual 
light 
and 
consent 
which 
one 
part 
receiveth 
of 
another. 
And 
therefore 
the 
opinion 
of 
Copernicus 
in 
astronomy, 
which 
astronomy 
itself 
cannot 
correct 
because 
it 
is 
not 
repugnant 
to 
any 
of 
the 
appearances, 
yet 
natural 
philosophy 
doth 
correct. 
On 
the 
other 
side 
if 
some 
of 
the 
ancient 
philosophers 
had 
been 
perfect 
in 
the 
observations 
of 
astronomy, 
and 
had 
called 
them 
to 
counsel 
when 
they 
made 
their 
principles 
and 
first 
axioms, 
they 
would 
never 
have 
divided 
their 
philosophy 
as 
the 
Cosmographers 
do 
their 
descriptions 
by 
globes, 
making 
one 
philosophy 
for 
heaven 
and 
another 
for 
under 
heaven, 
as 
in 
effect 
they 
do. 


So 
if 
the 
moral 
philosophers 
that 
have 
spent 
such 
an 
infinite 
quantity 
of 
debate 
touching 
Good 
and 
the 
highest 
good, 
had 
cast 
their 
eye 
abroad 
upon 
nature 
and 
beheld 
the 
appetite 
that 
is 
in 
all 
things 
to 
receive 
and 
to 
give; 
the 
one 
motion 
affecting 
preservation 
and 
the 
other 
multiplication; 
which 
appetites 
are 
most 
evidently 
seen 
in 
living 
creatures 
in 
the 
pleasure 
of 
nourishment 
and 
generation; 
and 
in 
man 
do 
make 
the 
aptest 
and 
most 
natural 
division 
of 
all 
his 
desires, 
being 
either 
of 
sense 
of 
pleasure 
or 
sense 
of 
power; 
and 
in 
the 
universal 
frame 
of 
the 
world 
are 
figured, 
the 
one 
in 
the 
beams 
of 
heaven 
which 
issue 
forth, 
and 
the 
other 
in 
the 
lap 
of 
the 
earth 
which 
takes 
in: 
and 
again 
if 
they 
had 
observed 
the 
motion 
of 
congruity 
or 
situation 
of 
the 
parts 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
whole, 
evident 
in 
so 
many 
particulars; 
and 
lastly 
if 
they 
had 
considered 
the 
motion 
(familiar 
in 
attraction 
of 
things) 
to 
approach 
to 
that 
which 
is 
higher 
in 
the 
same 
kind; 
when 
by 
these 
observations 
so 
easy 
and 
concurring 
in 
natural 
philosophy, 
they 
should 
have 
found 
out 
this 
quaternion 
of 
good, 
in 
enjoying 
or 
fruition, 
effecting 
or 
operation, 
consenting 
or 
proportion, 
and 
approach 
or 
assumption; 
they 
would 
have 
saved 
and 
abridged 
much 
of 
their 
long 
and 
wandering 
discourses 
of 
pleasure, 
virtue, 
duty, 
and 
religion. 
So 
likewise 
in 
this 
same 
logic 
and 
rhetoric, 
or 
arts 
of 
argument 
and 
grace 
of 
speech, 
if 
the 
great 
masters 
of 
them 
would 
but 
have 
gone 
a 
form 
lower, 
and 
looked 
but 
into 
the 
observations 
of 
Grammar 
concerning 
the 
kinds 
of 
words, 
their 
derivations, 
deflexions, 
and 
syntax; 
specially 
enriching 
the 
same 
with 
the 
helps 
of 
several 
languages, 
with 
their 
differing 
proprieties 
of 
words, 
phrases, 
and 
tropes; 
they 
might 
have 
found 
out 
more 
and 
better 



footsteps 
of 
common 
reason, 
help 
of 
disputation, 
and 
advantages 
of 
cavillation, 
than 
many 
of 
these 
which 
they 
have 
propounded. 
So 
again 
a 
man 
should 
be 
thought 
to 
dally, 
if 
he 
did 
note 
how 
the 
figures 
of 
rhetoric 
and 
music 
are 
many 
of 
them 
the 
same. 
The 
repetitions 
and 
traductions 
in 
speech 
and 
the 
reports 
and 
hauntings 
of 
sounds 
in 
music 
are 
the 
very 
same 
things. 
Plutarch 
hath 
almost 
made 
a 
book 
of 
the 
Lacedaemonian 
kind 
of 
jesting, 
which 
joined 
ever 
pleasure 
with 
distaste. 
SIR, 
(saith 
a 
man 
of 
art 
to 
Philip 
king 
of 
Macedon 
when 
he 
controlled 
him 
in 
his 
faculty,) 
GOD 
FORBID 
YOUR 
FORTUNE 
SHOULD 
BE 
SUCH 
AS 
TO 
KNOW 
THESE 
THINGS 
BETTER 
THAN 
I. 
In 
taxing 
his 
ignorance 
in 
his 
art 
he 
represented 
to 
him 
the 
perpetual 
greatness 
of 
his 
fortune, 
leaving 
him 
no 
vacant 
time 
for 
so 
mean 
a 
skill. 
Now 
in 
music 
it 
is 
one 
of 
the 
ordinariest 
flowers 
to 
fall 
from 
a 
discord 
or 
hard 
tune 
upon 
a 
sweet 
accord. 
The 
figure 
that 
Cicero 
and 
the 
rest 
commend 
as 
one 
of 
the 
best 
points 
of 
elegancy, 
which 
is 
the 
fine 
checking 
of 
expectation, 
is 
no 
less 
well 
known 
to 
the 
musicians 
when 
they 
have 
a 
special 
grace 
in 
flying 
the 
close 
or 
cadence. 
And 
these 
are 
no 
allusions 
but 
direct 
communities, 
the 
same 
delights 
of 
the 
mind 
being 
to 
be 
found 
not 
only 
in 
music, 
rhetoric, 
but 
in 
moral 
philosophy, 
policy, 
and 
other 
knowledges, 
and 
that 
obscure 
in 
the 
one, 
which 
is 
more 
apparent 
in 
the 
other, 
yea 
and 
that 
discovered 
in 
the 
one 
which 
is 
not 
found 
at 
all 
in 
the 
other, 
and 
so 
one 
science 
greatly 
aiding 
to 
the 
invention 
and 
augmentation 
of 
another. 
And 
therefore 
without 
this 
intercourse 
the 
axioms 
of 
sciences 
will 
fall 
out 
to 
be 
neither 
full 
nor 
true; 
but 
will 
be 
such 
opinions 
as 
Aristotle 
in 
some 
places 
doth 
wisely 
censure, 
when 
he 
saith 
THESE 
ARE 
THE 
OPINIONS 
OF 
PERSONS 
THAT 
HAVE 
RESPECT 
BUT 
TO 
A 
FEW 
THINGS. 
So 
then 
we 
see 
that 
this 
note 
leadeth 
us 
to 
an 
administration 
of 
knowledge 
in 
some 
such 
order 
and 
policy 
as 
the 
king 
of 
Spain 
in 
regard 
of 
his 
great 
dominions 
useth 
in 
state; 
who 
though 
he 
hath 
particular 
councils 
for 
several 
countries 
and 
affairs, 
yet 
hath 
one 
council 
of 
State 
or 
last 
resort, 
that 
receiveth 
the 
advertisements 
and 
certificates 
from 
all 
the 
rest. 
Hitherto 
of 
the 
diversion, 
succession, 
and 
conference 
of 
wits. 



Cap. 
9. 


That 
the 
End 
and 
Scope 
of 
Knowledge 
Hath 
Been 
Generally 
Mistaken, 
and 
that 
Men 
Were 
Never 
Well 
Advised 
what 
it 
was 
They 
Sought; 
Being 
the 
9th 
Chapter, 
Whereof 
a 
Fragment 
(Which 
is 
the 
End 
of 
the 
Same 
Chapter) 
Is 
Before. 


It 
appeareth 
then 
how 
rarely 
the 
wits 
and 
labours 
of 
men 
have 
been 
converted 
to 
the 
severe 
and 
original 
inquisition 
of 
knowledge; 
and 
in 
those 
who 
have 
pretended, 
what 
hurt 
hath 
been 
done 
by 
the 
affectation 
of 
professors 
and 
the 
distraction 
of 
such 
as 
were 
no 
professors; 
and 
how 
there 
was 
never 
in 
effect 
any 
conjunction 
or 
combination 
of 
wits 
in 
the 
first 
and 
inducing 
search, 
but 
that 
every 
man 
wrought 
apart, 
and 
would 
either 
have 
his 
own 
way 
or 
else 
would 
go 
no 
further 
than 
his 
guide, 
having 
in 
the 
one 
case 
the 
honour 
of 
a 
first, 
and 
in 
the 
other 
the 
ease 
of 
a 
second; 
and 
lastly 
how 
in 
the 
descent 
and 
continuance 
of 
wits 
and 
labours 
the 
succession 
hath 
been 
in 
the 
most 
popular 
and 
weak 
opinions, 
like 
unto 
the 
weakest 
natures 
which 
many 
times 
have 
most 
children, 
and 
in 
them 
also 
the 
condition 
of 
succession 
hath 
been 
rather 
to 
defend 
and 
to 
adorn 
than 
to 
add; 
and 
if 
to 
add, 
yet 
that 
addition 
to 
be 
rather 
a 
refining 
of 
a 
part 
than 
an 
increase 
of 
the 
whole. 
But 
the 
impediments 
of 
time 
and 
accidents, 
though 
they 
have 
wrought 
a 
general 
indisposition, 
yet 
are 
they 
not 
so 
peremptory 
and 
binding 
as 
the 
internal 
impediments 
and 
clouds 
in 
the 
mind 
and 
spirit 
of 
man, 
whereof 
it 
now 
followeth 
to 
speak. 


The 
Scripture 
speaking 
of 
the 
worst 
sort 
of 
error 
saith, 
ERRARE 
FECIT 
COS 
IN 
INVIO 
ET 
NON 
IN 
VIA. 
For 
a 
man 
may 
wander 
in 
the 
way, 
by 
rounding 
up 
and 
down. 
But 
if 
men 
have 
failed 
in 
their 
very 
direction 
and 
address 
that 
error 
will 
never 
by 
good 
fortune 
correct 
itself. 
Now 
it 
hath 
fared 
with 
men 
in 
their 
contemplations 
as 
Seneca 
saith 
it 
fareth 
with 
them 
in 
their 
actions, 
DE 
PARTIBUS 
VITAE 
QUISQUE 
DELIBERAT, 
DE 
SUMMA 
NEMO. 
A 
course 
very 
ordinary 
with 
men 
who 
receive 
for 
the 
most 
part 
their 



final 
ends 
from 
the 
inclination 
of 
their 
nature, 
or 
from 
common 
example 
and 
opinion, 
never 
questioning 
or 
examining 
them, 
nor 
reducing 
them 
to 
any 
clear 
certainty; 
and 
use 
only 
to 
call 
themselves 
to 
account 
and 
deliberation 
touching 
the 
means 
and 
second 
ends, 
and 
thereby 
set 
themselves 
in 
the 
right 
way 
to 
the 
wrong 
place. 
So 
likewise 
upon 
the 
natural 
curiosity 
and 
desire 
to 
know, 
they 
have 
put 
themselves 
in 
way 
without 
foresight 
or 
consideration 
of 
their 
journey’s 
end. 


For 
I 
find 
that 
even 
those 
that 
have 
sought 
knowledge 
for 
itself, 
and 
not 
for 
benefit 
or 
ostentation 
or 
any 
practical 
enablement 
in 
the 
course 
of 
their 
life, 
have 
nevertheless 
propounded 
to 
themselves 
a 
wrong 
mark, 
namely 
satisfaction 
(which 
men 
call 
truth) 
and 
not 
operation. 
For 
as 
in 
the 
courts 
and 
services 
of 
princes 
and 
states 
it 
is 
a 
much 
easier 
matter 
to 
give 
satisfaction 
than 
to 
do 
the 
business; 
so 
in 
the 
inquiring 
of 
causes 
and 
reasons 
it 
is 
much 
easier 
to 
find 
out 
such 
causes 
as 
will 
satisfy 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
and 
quiet 
objections, 
than 
such 
causes 
as 
will 
direct 
him 
and 
give 
him 
light 
to 
new 
experiences 
and 
inventions. 
And 
this 
did 
Celsus 
note 
wisely 
and 
truly, 
how 
that 
the 
causes 
which 
are 
in 
use 
and 
whereof 
the 
knowledges 
now 
received 
do 
consist, 
were 
in 
time 
minors 
and 
subsequents 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
particulars 
out 
of 
which 
they 
were 
induced 
and 
collected; 
and 
that 
it 
was 
not 
the 
light 
of 
those 
causes 
which 
discovered 
particulars, 
but 
only 
the 
particulars 
being 
first 
found, 
men 
did 
fall 
on 
glossing 
and 
discoursing 
of 
the 
causes; 
which 
is 
the 
reason 
why 
the 
learning 
that 
now 
is 
hath 
the 
curse 
of 
barrenness, 
and 
is 
courtesanlike, 
for 
pleasure, 
and 
not 
for 
fruit. 
Nay 
to 
compare 
it 
rightly, 
the 
strange 
fiction 
of 
the 
poets 
of 
the 
transformation 
of 
Scylla 
seemeth 
to 
be 
a 
lively 
emblem 
of 
this 
philosophy 
and 
knowledge; 
a 
fair 
woman 
upwards 
in 
the 
parts 
of 
show, 
but 
when 
you 
come 
to 
the 
parts 
of 
use 
and 
generation, 
Barking 
Monsters; 
for 
no 
better 
are 
the 
endless 
distorted 
questions, 
which 
ever 
have 
been, 
and 
of 
necessity 
must 
be, 
the 
end 
and 
womb 
of 
such 
knowledge. 


But 
yet 
nevertheless 
here 
I 
may 
be 
mistaken, 
by 
reason 
of 
some 
which 
have 
much 
in 
their 
pen 
the 
referring 
sciences 
to 
action 
and 
the 
use 
of 
man, 
which 
mean 
quite 
another 
matter 
than 
I 
do. 
For 
they 
mean 
a 
contriving 
of 
directions 
and 
precepts 
for 
readiness 
of 
practice, 
which 
I 
discommend 
not, 
so 
it 
be 
not 
occasion 
that 
some 
quantity 
of 
the 
science 
be 
lost; 
for 
else 
it 
will 
be 
such 
a 
piece 
of 
husbandry 
as 
to 
put 
away 
a 
manor 
lying 
somewhat 
scattered, 
to 
buy 
in 
a 
close 
that 
lieth 
handsomely 
about 
a 
dwelling. 
But 
my 



intention 
contrariwise 
is 
to 
increase 
and 
multiply 
the 
revenues 
and 
possessions 
of 
man, 
and 
not 
to 
trim 
up 
only 
or 
order 
with 
conveniency 
the 
grounds 
whereof 
he 
is 
already 
stated. 
Wherefore 
the 
better 
to 
make 
myself 
understood 
that 
I 
mean 
nothing 
less 
than 
words, 
and 
directly 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
point 
which 
we 
are 
now 
upon, 
that 
is, 
what 
is 
the 
true 
end, 
scope, 
or 
office 
of 
knowledge, 
which 
I 
have 
set 
down 
to 
consist 
not 
in 
any 
plausible, 
delectable, 
reverend, 
or 
admired 
discourse, 
or 
any 
satisfactory 
arguments, 
but 
in 
effecting 
and 
working, 
and 
in 
discovery 
of 
particulars 
not 
revealed 
before 
for 
the 
better 
endowment 
and 
help 
of 
man’s 
life; 
I 
have 
thought 
good 
to 
make 
as 
it 
were 
a 
Kalendar 
or 
Inventory 
of 
the 
wealth, 
furniture, 
or 
means 
of 
man 
according 
to 
his 
present 
estate, 
as 
far 
as 
it 
is 
known; 
which 
I 
do 
not 
to 
shew 
any 
universality 
of 
sense 
or 
knowledge, 
and 
much 
less 
to 
make 
a 
satire 
of 
reprehension 
in 
respect 
of 
wants 
and 
errors, 
but 
partly 
because 
cogitations 
new 
had 
need 
of 
some 
grossness 
and 
inculcation 
to 
make 
them 
perceived; 
and 
chiefly 
to 
the 
end 
that 
for 
the 
time 
to 
come 
(upon 
the 
account 
and 
state 
now 
made 
and 
cast 
up) 
it 
may 
appear 
what 
increase 
this 
new 
manner 
of 
use 
and 
administration 
of 
the 
stock 
(if 
it 
be 
once 
planted) 
shall 
bring 
with 
it 
hereafter; 
and 
for 
the 
time 
present 
(in 
case 
I 
should 
be 
prevented 
by 
death 
to 
propound 
and 
reveal 
this 
new 
light 
as 
I 
purpose) 
yet 
I 
may 
at 
the 
least 
give 
some 
awaking 
note 
both 
of 
the 
wants 
in 
man’s 
present 
condition 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
supplies 
to 
be 
wished; 
though 
for 
mine 
own 
part 
neither 
do 
I 
much 
build 
upon 
my 
present 
anticipations, 
neither 
do 
I 
think 
ourselves 
yet 
learned 
or 
wise 
enough 
to 
wish 
reasonably: 
for 
as 
it 
asks 
some 
knowledge 
to 
demand 
a 
question 
not 
impertinent, 
so 
it 
asketh 
some 
sense 
to 
make 
a 
wish 
not 
absurd. 



Cap.

The 
Inventory, 
or 
an 
Enumeration 
and 
View 
of 
Inventions 
Already 
Discovered 
and 
in 
Use, 
Together 
with 
a 
Note 
of 
the 
Wants 
And 
the 
Nature 
of 
the 
Supplies, 
Being 
the 
10th 
Chapter; 
and 
this 
a 
Small 
Fragment 
Thereof, 
Being 
the 
Preface 
to 
the 
Inventory. 


The 
plainest 
method 
and 
most 
directly 
pertinent 
to 
this 
intention, 
will 
be 
to 
make 
distribution 
of 
sciences, 
arts, 
inventions, 
works, 
and 
their 
portions, 
according 
to 
the 
use 
and 
tribute 
which 
they 
yield 
and 
render 
to 
the 
conditions 
of 
man’s 
life, 
and 
under 
those 
several 
uses, 
being 
as 
several 
offices 
of 
provisions, 
to 
charge 
and 
tax 
what 
may 
be 
reasonably 
exacted 
or 
demanded; 
not 
guiding 
ourselves 
neither 
by 
the 
poverty 
of 
experiences 
and 
probations, 
nor 
according 
to 
the 
vanity 
of 
credulous 
imaginations; 
and 
then 
upon 
those 
charges 
and 
taxations 
to 
distinguish 
and 
present, 
as 
it 
were 
in 
several 
columns, 
what 
is 
extant 
and 
already 
found, 
and 
what 
is 
defective 
and 
further 
to 
be 
provided. 
Of 
which 
provisions, 
because 
in 
many 
of 
them 
after 
the 
manner 
of 
slothful 
and 
faulty 
officers 
and 
accomptants 
it 
will 
be 
returned 
(by 
way 
of 
excuse) 
that 
no 
such 
are 
to 
be 
had, 
it 
will 
be 
fit 
to 
give 
some 
light 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
supplies, 
whereby 
it 
will 
evidently 
appear 
that 
they 
are 
to 
be 
compassed 
and 
procured. 
And 
yet 
nevertheless 
on 
the 
other 
side 
again 
it 
will 
be 
as 
fit 
to 
check 
and 
control 
the 
vain 
and 
void 
assignations 
and 
gifts 
whereby 
certain 
ignorant, 
extravagant, 
and 
abusing 
wits 
have 
pretended 
to 
indue 
the 
state 
of 
man 
with 
wonders, 
differing 
as 
much 
from 
truth 
in 
nature 
as 
Caesar’s 
Commentaries 
differeth 
from 
the 
acts 
of 
King 
Arthur 
or 
Huon 
of 
Bourdeaux 
in 
story. 
For 
it 
is 
true 
that 
Caesar 
did 
greater 
things 
than 
those 
idle 
wits 
had 
the 
audacity 
to 
feign 
their 
supposed 
worthies 
to 
have 
done; 
but 
he 
did 
them 
not 
in 
that 
monstrous 
and 
fabulous 
manner. 



Cap.

The 
Chapter 
Immediately 
Following 
the 
Inventory; 
Being 
the 
11th 
in 
Order; 
a 
Part 
Thereof. 


It 
appeareth 
then 
what 
is 
now 
in 
proposition 
not 
by 
general 
circumlocution 
but 
by 
particular 
note. 
No 
former 
philosophy 
varied 
in 
terms 
or 
method; 
no 
new 
PLACET 
or 
speculation 
upon 
particulars 
already 
known; 
no 
referring 
to 
action 
by 
any 
manual 
of 
practice; 
but 
the 
revealing 
and 
discovering 
of 
new 
inventions 
and 
operations. 
This 
to 
be 
done 
without 
the 
errors 
and 
conjectures 
of 
art, 
or 
the 
length 
or 
difficulties 
of 
experience; 
the 
nature 
and 
kinds 
of 
which 
inventions 
have 
been 
described 
as 
they 
could 
be 
discovered; 
for 
your 
eye 
cannot 
pass 
one 
kenning 
without 
further 
sailing; 
only 
we 
have 
stood 
upon 
the 
best 
advantages 
of 
the 
notions 
received, 
as 
upon 
a 
mount, 
to 
shew 
the 
knowledges 
adjacent 
and 
confining. 
If 
therefore 
the 
true 
end 
of 
knowledge 
not 
propounded 
hath 
bred 
large 
error, 
the 
best 
and 
perfectest 
condition 
of 
the 
same 
end 
not 
perceived 
will 
cause 
some 
declination. 
For 
when 
the 
butt 
is 
set 
up 
men 
need 
not 
rove, 
but 
except 
the 
white 
be 
placed 
men 
cannot 
level. 
This 
perfection 
we 
mean 
not 
in 
the 
worth 
of 
the 
effect, 
but 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
direction; 
for 
our 
purpose 
is 
not 
to 
stir 
up 
men’s 
hopes, 
but 
to 
guide 
their 
travels. 
The 
fullness 
of 
direction 
to 
work 
and 
produce 
any 
effect 
consisteth 
in 
two 
conditions, 
certainty 
and 
liberty. 
Certainty 
is 
when 
the 
direction 
is 
not 
only 
true 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
but 
infallible. 
Liberty 
is 
when 
the 
direction 
is 
not 
restrained 
to 
some 
definite 
means, 
but 
comprehendeth 
all 
the 
means 
and 
ways 
possible; 
for 
the 
poet 
saith 
well 
SAPIENTIBUS 
UNDIQUE 
LATAE 
SUNT 
VIAE, 
and 
where 
there 
is 
the 
greatest 
plurality 
of 
change, 
there 
is 
the 
greatest 
singularity 
of 
choice. 
Besides 
as 
a 
conjectural 
direction 
maketh 
a 
casual 
effect, 
so 
a 
particular 
and 
restrained 
direction 
is 
no 
less 
casual 
than 
an 
uncertain. 
For 
those 
particular 
means 
whereunto 
it 
is 
tied 
may 
be 
out 
of 
your 
power 
or 
may 
be 
accompanied 
with 
an 
overvalue 
of 
prejudice; 
and 
so 
if 
for 
want 
of 
certainty 
in 
direction 
you 
are 
frustrated 
in 
success, 
for 
want 
of 
variety 
in 
direction 
you 
are 
stopped 



in 
attempt. 
If 
therefore 
your 
direction 
be 
certain, 
it 
must 
refer 
you 
and 
point 
you 
to 
somewhat 
which, 
if 
it 
be 
present, 
the 
effect 
you 
seek 
will 
of 
necessity 
follow, 
else 
may 
you 
perform 
and 
not 
obtain. 
If 
it 
be 
free, 
then 
must 
it 
refer 
you 
to 
somewhat 
which 
if 
it 
be 
absent 
the 
effect 
you 
seek 
will 
of 
necessity 
withdraw, 
else 
may 
you 
have 
power 
and 
not 
attempt. 
This 
notion 
Aristotle 
had 
in 
light, 
though 
not 
in 
use. 
For 
the 
two 
commended 
rules 
by 
him 
set 
down, 
whereby 
the 
axioms 
of 
sciences 
are 
precepted 
to 
be 
made 
convertible, 
and 
which 
the 
latter 
men 
have 
not 
without 
elegancy 
surnamed 
the 
one 
the 
rule 
of 
truth 
because 
it 
preventeth 
deceit, 
the 
other 
the 
rule 
of 
prudence 
because 
it 
freeth 
election, 
are 
the 
same 
thing 
in 
speculation 
and 
affirmation 
which 
we 
now 
observe. 
An 
example 
will 
make 
my 
meaning 
attained, 
and 
yet 
percase 
make 
it 
thought 
that 
they 
attained 
it 
not. 
Let 
the 
effect 
to 
be 
produced 
be 
Whiteness; 
let 
the 
first 
direction 
be 
that 
if 
air 
and 
water 
be 
intermingled 
or 
broken 
in 
small 
portions 
together, 
whiteness 
will 
ensue, 
as 
in 
snow, 
in 
the 
breaking 
of 
the 
waves 
of 
the 
sea 
and 
rivers, 
and 
the 
like. 
This 
direction 
is 
certain, 
but 
very 
particular 
and 
restrained, 
being 
tied 
but 
to 
air 
and 
water. 
Let 
the 
second 
direction 
be, 
that 
if 
air 
be 
mingled 
as 
before 
with 
any 
transparent 
body, 
such 
nevertheless 
as 
is 
uncoloured 
and 
more 
grossly 
transparent 
than 
air 
itself, 
that 
then 
etc. 
as 
glass 
or 
crystal, 
being 
beaten 
to 
fine 
powder, 
by 
the 
interposition 
of 
the 
air 
becometh 
white; 
the 
white 
of 
an 
egg 
being 
clear 
of 
itself, 
receiving 
air 
by 
agitation 
becometh 
white, 
receiving 
air 
by 
concoction 
becometh 
white; 
here 
you 
are 
freed 
from 
water, 
and 
advanced 
to 
a 
clear 
body, 
and 
still 
tied 
to 
air. 
Let 
the 
third 
direction 
exclude 
or 
remove 
the 
restraint 
of 
an 
uncoloured 
body, 
as 
in 
amber, 
sapphires, 
etc. 
which 
beaten 
to 
fine 
powder 
become 
white; 
in 
wine 
and 
beer, 
which 
brought 
to 
froth 
become 
white. 
Let 
the 
fourth 
direction 
exclude 
the 
restraint 
of 
a 
body 
more 
grossly 
transparent 
than 
air, 
as 
in 
flame, 
being 
a 
body 
compounded 
between 
air 
and 
a 
finer 
substance 
than 
air; 
which 
flame 
if 
it 
were 
not 
for 
the 
smoke, 
which 
is 
the 
third 
substance 
that 
incorporateth 
itself 
and 
dyeth 
the 
flame, 
would 
be 
more 
perfect 
white. 
In 
all 
these 
four 
directions 
air 
still 
beareth 
a 
part. 
Let 
the 
fifth 
direction 
then 
be, 
that 
if 
any 
bodies, 
both 
transparent 
but 
in 
an 
unequal 
degree, 
be 
mingled 
as 
before, 
whiteness 
will 
follow; 
as 
oil 
and 
water 
beaten 
to 
an 
ointment, 
though 
by 
settling 
the 
air 
which 
gathereth 
in 
the 
agitation 
be 
evaporate, 
yet 
remaineth 
white; 
and 
the 
powder 
of 
glass 
or 
crystal 
put 
into 
water, 
whereby 
the 
air 
giveth 
place, 
yet 
remaineth 
white, 
though 
not 
so 
perfect. 
Now 
are 
you 
freed 
from 
air, 
but 
still 
you 
are 
tied 
to 
transparent 
bodies. 
To 
ascend 
further 
by 
scale 
I 
do 
forbear, 
partly 
because 
it 
would 
draw 



on 
the 
example 
to 
an 
over-great 
length, 
but 
chiefly 
because 
it 
would 
open 
that 
which 
in 
this 
work 
I 
determine 
to 
reserve; 
for 
to 
pass 
through 
the 
whole 
history 
and 
observation 
of 
colours 
and 
objects 
visible 
were 
too 
long 
a 
digression; 
and 
our 
purpose 
is 
now 
to 
give 
an 
example 
of 
a 
free 
direction, 
thereby 
to 
distinguish 
and 
describe 
it; 
and 
not 
to 
set 
down 
a 
form 
of 
interpretation 
how 
to 
recover 
and 
attain 
it. 
But 
as 
we 
intend 
not 
now 
to 
reveal, 
so 
we 
are 
circumspect 
not 
to 
mislead; 
and 
therefore 
(this 
warning 
being 
given) 
returning 
to 
our 
purpose 
in 
hand, 
we 
admit 
the 
sixth 
direction 
to 
be, 
that 
all 
bodies 
or 
parts 
of 
bodies 
which 
are 
unequal 
equally, 
that 
is 
in 
a 
simple 
proportion, 
do 
represent 
whiteness; 
we 
will 
explain 
this, 
though 
we 
induce 
it 
not. 
It 
is 
then 
to 
be 
understood, 
that 
absolute 
equality 
produceth 
transparence, 
inequality 
in 
simple 
order 
or 
proportion 
produceth 
whiteness, 
inequality 
in 
compound 
or 
respective 
order 
or 
proportion 
produceth 
all 
other 
colours, 
and 
absolute 
or 
orderless 
inequality 
produceth 
blackness; 
which 
diversity, 
if 
so 
gross 
a 
demonstration 
be 
needful, 
may 
be 
signified 
by 
four 
tables; 
a 
blank, 
a 
chequer, 
a 
fret, 
and 
a 
medley; 
whereof 
the 
fret 
is 
evident 
to 
admit 
great 
variety. 
Out 
of 
this 
assertion 
are 
satisfied 
a 
multitude 
of 
effects 
and 
observations, 
as 
that 
whiteness 
and 
blackness 
are 
most 
incompatible 
with 
transparence; 
that 
whiteness 
keepeth 
light, 
and 
blackness 
stoppeth 
light, 
but 
neither 
passeth 
it; 
that 
whiteness 
or 
blackness 
are 
never 
produced 
in 
rainbows, 
diamonds, 
crystals, 
and 
the 
like; 
that 
white 
giveth 
no 
dye, 
and 
black 
hardly 
taketh 
dye; 
that 
whiteness 
seemeth 
to 
have 
an 
affinity 
with 
dryness, 
and 
blackness 
with 
moisture; 
that 
adustion 
causeth 
blackness, 
and 
calcination 
whiteness; 
that 
flowers 
are 
generally 
of 
fresh 
colours, 
and 
rarely 
black, 
etc. 
All 
which 
I 
do 
now 
mention 
confusedly 
by 
way 
of 
derivation 
and 
not 
by 
way 
of 
induction. 
This 
sixth 
direction, 
which 
I 
have 
thus 
explained, 
is 
of 
good 
and 
competent 
liberty 
for 
whiteness 
fixed 
and 
inherent, 
but 
not 
for 
whiteness 
fantastical 
or 
appearing, 
as 
shall 
be 
afterwards 
touched. 
But 
first 
do 
you 
need 
a 
reduction 
back 
to 
certainty 
or 
verity; 
for 
it 
is 
not 
all 
position 
or 
contexture 
of 
unequal 
bodies 
that 
will 
produce 
colour; 
for 
AQUA 
FORTIS, 
oil 
of 
VITRIOL, 
etc. 
more 
manifestly, 
and 
many 
other 
substances 
more 
obscurely, 
do 
consist 
of 
very 
unequal 
parts, 
which 
yet 
are 
transparent 
and 
clear. 
Therefore 
the 
reduction 
must 
be, 
that 
the 
bodies 
or 
parts 
of 
bodies 
so 
intermingled 
as 
before 
be 
of 
a 
certain 
grossness 
or 
magnitude; 
for 
the 
unequalities 
which 
move 
the 
sight 
must 
have 
a 
further 
dimension 
and 
quantity 
than 
those 
which 
operate 
many 
other 
effects. 
Some 
few 
grains 
of 
saffron 
will 
give 
a 
tincture 
to 
a 
tun 
of 
water; 
but 
so 
many 
grains 
of 
civet 
will 



give 
a 
perfume 
to 
a 
whole 
chamber 
of 
air. 
And 
therefore 
when 
Democritus 
(from 
whom 
Epicurus 
did 
borrow 
it) 
held 
that 
the 
position 
of 
the 
solid 
portions 
was 
the 
cause 
of 
colours, 
yet 
in 
the 
very 
truth 
of 
his 
assertion 
he 
should 
have 
added, 
that 
the 
portions 
are 
required 
to 
be 
of 
some 
magnitude. 
And 
this 
is 
one 
cause 
why 
colours 
have 
little 
inwardness 
and 
necessitude 
with 
the 
nature 
and 
proprieties 
of 
things, 
those 
things 
resembling 
in 
colour 
which 
otherwise 
differ 
most, 
as 
salt 
and 
sugar, 
and 
contrariwise 
differing 
in 
colour 
which 
otherwise 
resemble 
most, 
as 
the 
white 
and 
blue 
violets, 
and 
the 
several 
veins 
of 
one 
agate 
or 
marble, 
by 
reason 
that 
other 
virtues 
consist 
in 
more 
subtile 
proportions 
than 
colours 
do; 
and 
yet 
are 
there 
virtues 
and 
natures 
which 
require 
a 
grosser 
magnitude 
than 
colours, 
as 
well 
as 
scents 
and 
divers 
other 
require 
a 
more 
subtile; 
for 
as 
the 
portion 
of 
a 
body 
will 
give 
forth 
scent 
which 
is 
too 
small 
to 
be 
seen, 
so 
the 
portion 
of 
a 
body 
will 
shew 
colours 
which 
is 
too 
small 
to 
be 
endued 
with 
weight; 
and 
therefore 
one 
of 
the 
prophets 
with 
great 
elegancy 
describing 
how 
all 
creatures 
carry 
no 
proportion 
towards 
God 
the 
creator, 
saith, 
THAT 
ALL 
THE 
NATIONS 
IN 
RESPECT 
OF 
HIM 
ARE 
LIKE 
THE 
DUST 
UPON 
THE 
BALANCE, 
which 
is 
a 
thing 
appeareth 
but 
weigheth 
not. 
But 
to 
return, 
there 
resteth 
a 
further 
freeing 
of 
this 
sixth 
direction; 
for 
the 
clearness 
of 
a 
river 
or 
stream 
sheweth 
white 
at 
a 
distance, 
and 
crystalline 
glasses 
deliver 
the 
face 
or 
any 
other 
object 
falsified 
in 
whiteness, 
and 
long 
beholding 
the 
snow 
to 
a 
weak 
eye 
giveth 
an 
impression 
of 
azure 
rather 
than 
of 
whiteness. 
So 
as 
for 
whiteness 
in 
apparition 
only 
and 
representation 
by 
the 
qualifying 
of 
the 
light, 
altering 
the 
INTERMEDIUM, 
or 
affecting 
the 
eye 
itself, 
it 
reacheth 
not. 
But 
you 
must 
free 
your 
direction 
to 
the 
producing 
of 
such 
an 
incidence, 
impression, 
or 
operation, 
as 
may 
cause 
a 
precise 
and 
determinate 
passion 
of 
the 
eye; 
a 
matter 
which 
is 
much 
more 
easy 
to 
induce 
than 
that 
which 
we 
have 
passed 
through; 
but 
yet 
because 
it 
hath 
a 
full 
coherence 
both 
with 
that 
act 
of 
radiation 
(which 
hath 
hitherto 
been 
conceived 
and 
termed 
so 
unproperly 
and 
untruly 
by 
some 
an 
effluxion 
of 
spiritual 
species 
and 
by 
others 
an 
investing 
of 
the 
INTERMEDIUM 
with 
a 
motion 
which 
successively 
is 
conveyed 
to 
the 
eye) 
and 
with 
the 
act 
of 
sense, 
wherein 
I 
should 
likewise 
open 
that 
which 
I 
think 
good 
to 
withdraw, 
I 
will 
omit. 
Neither 
do 
I 
contend 
but 
that 
this 
motion 
which 
I 
call 
the 
freeing 
of 
a 
direction, 
in 
the 
received 
philosophies 
(as 
far 
as 
a 
swimming 
anticipation 
could 
take 
hold) 
might 
be 
perceived 
and 
discerned; 
being 
not 
much 
other 
matter 
than 
that 
which 
they 
did 
not 
only 
aim 
at 
in 
the 
two 
rules 
of 
AXIOMS 
before 
remembered, 
but 
more 
nearly 
also 
in 
that 
which 



they 
term 
the 
form 
or 
formal 
cause, 
or 
that 
which 
they 
call 
the 
true 
difference; 
both 
which 
nevertheless 
it 
seemeth 
they 
propound 
rather 
as 
impossibilities 
and 
wishes 
than 
as 
things 
within 
the 
compass 
of 
human 
comprehension. 
For 
Plato 
casteth 
his 
burden 
and 
saith 
THAT 
HE 
WILL 
REVERE 
HIM 
AS 
A 
GOD, 
THAT 
CAN 
TRULY 
DIVIDE 
AND 
DEFINE; 
which 
cannot 
be 
but 
by 
true 
forms 
and 
differences. 
Wherein 
I 
join 
hands 
with 
him, 
confessing 
as 
much 
as 
yet 
assuming 
to 
myself 
little; 
for 
if 
any 
man 
call 
by 
the 
strength 
of 
his 
ANTICIPATIONS 
find 
out 
forms, 
I 
will 
magnify 
him 
with 
the 
foremost. 
But 
as 
any 
of 
them 
would 
say 
that 
if 
divers 
things 
which 
many 
men 
know 
by 
instruction 
and 
observation 
another 
knew 
by 
revelation 
and 
without 
those 
means, 
they 
would 
take 
him 
for 
somewhat 
supernatural 
and 
divine; 
so 
I 
do 
acknowledge 
that 
if 
any 
man 
can 
by 
anticipations 
reach 
to 
that 
which 
a 
weak 
and 
inferior 
wit 
may 
attain 
to 
by 
interpretation, 
he 
cannot 
receive 
too 
high 
a 
title. 
Nay 
I 
for 
my 
part 
do 
indeed 
admire 
to 
see 
how 
far 
some 
of 
them 
have 
proceeded 
by 
their 
ANTICIPATIONS; 
but 
how? 
It 
is 
as 
I 
wonder 
at 
some 
blind 
men, 
to 
see 
what 
shift 
they 
make 
without 
their 
eyesight; 
thinking 
with 
myself 
that 
if 
I 
were 
blind 
I 
could 
hardly 
do 
it. 
Again 
Aristotle’s 
school 
confesseth 
that 
there 
is 
no 
true 
knowledge 
but 
by 
causes, 
no 
true 
cause 
but 
the 
form, 
no 
true 
form 
known 
except 
one, 
which 
they 
are 
pleased 
to 
allow; 
and 
therefore 
thus 
far 
their 
evidence 
standeth 
with 
us, 
that 
both 
hitherto 
there 
hath 
been 
nothing 
but 
a 
shadow 
of 
knowledge, 
and 
that 
we 
propound 
now 
that 
which 
is 
agreed 
to 
be 
worthiest 
to 
be 
sought, 
and 
hardest 
to 
be 
found. 
There 
wanteth 
now 
a 
part 
very 
necessary, 
not 
by 
way 
of 
supply 
but 
by 
way 
of 
caution; 
for 
as 
it 
is 
seen 
for 
the 
most 
part 
that 
the 
outward 
tokens 
and 
badges 
of 
excellency 
and 
perfection 
are 
more 
incident 
to 
things 
merely 
counterfeit 
than 
to 
that 
which 
is 
true, 
but 
for 
a 
meaner 
and 
baser 
sort; 
as 
a 
dubline 
is 
more 
like 
a 
perfect 
ruby 
than 
a 
spinel, 
and 
a 
counterfeit 
angel 
is 
made 
more 
like 
a 
true 
angel 
than 
if 
it 
were 
an 
angel 
coined 
of 
China 
gold; 
in 
like 
manner 
the 
direction 
carrieth 
a 
resemblance 
of 
a 
true 
direction 
in 
verity 
and 
liberty 
which 
indeed 
is 
no 
direction 
at 
all. 
For 
though 
your 
direction 
seem 
to 
be 
certain 
and 
free 
by 
pointing 
you 
to 
a 
nature 
that 
is 
unseparable 
from 
the 
nature 
you 
inquire 
upon, 
yet 
if 
it 
do 
not 
carry 
you 
on 
a 
degree 
or 
remove 
nearer 
to 
action, 
operation, 
or 
light 
to 
make 
or 
produce, 
it 
is 
but 
superficial 
and 
counterfeit. 
Wherefore 
to 
secure 
and 
warrant 
what 
is 
a 
true 
direction, 
though 
that 
general 
note 
I 
have 
given 
be 
perspicuous 
in 
itself 
(for 
a 
man 
shall 
soon 
cast 
with 
himself 
whether 
he 
be 
ever 
the 
nearer 
to 
effect 
and 
operate 
or 
no, 
or 
whether 
he 
have 
won 
but 
an 
abstract 
or 
varied 
notion) 



yet 
for 
better 
instruction 
I 
will 
deliver 
three 
particular 
notes 
of 
caution. 
The 
first 
is 
that 
the 
nature 
discovered 
be 
more 
original 
than 
the 
nature 
supposed, 
and 
not 
more 
secondary 
or 
of 
the 
like 
degree; 
as 
to 
make 
a 
stone 
bright 
or 
to 
make 
it 
smooth 
it 
is 
a 
good 
direction 
to 
say, 
make 
it 
even; 
but 
to 
make 
a 
stone 
even 
it 
is 
no 
good 
direction 
to 
say, 
make 
it 
bright 
or 
make 
it 
smooth; 
for 
the 
rule 
is 
that 
the 
disposition 
of 
any 
thing 
referring 
to 
the 
state 
of 
it 
in 
itself 
or 
the 
parts, 
is 
more 
original 
than 
that 
which 
is 
relative 
or 
transitive 
towards 
another 
thing. 
So 
evenness 
is 
the 
disposition 
of 
the 
stone 
in 
itself, 
but 
smooth 
is 
to 
the 
hand 
and 
bright 
to 
the 
eye, 
and 
yet 
nevertheless 
they 
all 
cluster 
and 
concur; 
and 
yet 
the 
direction 
is 
more 
unperfect, 
if 
it 
do 
appoint 
you 
to 
such 
a 
relative 
as 
is 
in 
the 
same 
kind 
and 
not 
in 
a 
diverse. 
For 
in 
the 
direction 
to 
produce 
brightness 
by 
smoothness, 
although 
properly 
it 
win 
no 
degree, 
and 
will 
never 
teach 
you 
any 
new 
particulars 
before 
unknown; 
yet 
by 
way 
of 
suggestion 
or 
bringing 
to 
mind 
it 
may 
draw 
your 
consideration 
to 
some 
particulars 
known 
but 
not 
remembered; 
as 
you 
shall 
sooner 
remember 
some 
practical 
means 
of 
making 
smoothness, 
than 
if 
you 
had 
fixed 
your 
consideration 
only 
upon 
brightness 
by 
making 
reflexion, 
as 
thus, 
make 
it 
such 
as 
you 
may 
see 
your 
face 
in 
it, 
this 
is 
merely 
secondary, 
and 
helpeth 
neither 
by 
way 
of 
informing 
nor 
by 
way 
of 
suggestion. 
So 
if 
in 
the 
inquiry 
of 
whiteness 
you 
were 
directed 
to 
make 
such 
a 
colour 
as 
should 
be 
seen 
furthest 
in 
a 
dark 
light; 
here 
you 
are 
advanced 
nothing 
at 
all. 
For 
these 
kinds 
of 
natures 
are 
but 
proprieties, 
effects, 
circumstances, 
concurrences, 
or 
what 
else 
you 
shall 
like 
to 
call 
them, 
and 
not 
radical 
and 
formative 
natures 
towards 
the 
nature 
supposed. 
The 
second 
caution 
is 
that 
the 
nature 
inquired 
be 
collected 
by 
division 
before 
composition, 
or 
to 
speak 
more 
properly, 
by 
composition 
subaltern 
before 
you 
ascend 
to 
composition 
absolute, 
etc. 


OF 
THE 
INTERNAL 
AND 
PROFOUND 
ERRORS 
AND 
SUPERSTITIONS 
IN 
THE 
NATURE 
OF 
THE 
MIND, 
AND 
OF 
THE 
FOUR 
SORTS 
OF 
IDOLS 
OR 
FICTIONS 
WHICH 
OFFER 
THEMSELVES 
TO 
THE 
UNDERSTANDING 
IN 
THE 
INQUISITION 
OF 
KNOWLEDGE; 
BEING 
THE 
16TH 
CHAPTER, 
AND 
THIS 
A 
SMALL 
FRAGMENT 
THEREOF, 
BEING 
A 
PREFACE 
TO 
THE 
INWARD 
ELENCHES 
OF 
THE 
MIND. 


The 
opinion 
of 
Epicurus 
that 
the 
gods 
were 
of 
human 
shape, 
was 
rather 
justly 
derided 
than 
seriously 
confuted 
by 
the 
other 
sects, 
demanding 
whether 
every 
kind 
of 
sensible 
creatures 
did 
not 
think 
their 
own 
figure 
fairest, 



as 
the 
horse, 
the 
bull, 
and 
the 
like, 
which 
found 
no 
beauty 
but 
in 
their 
own 
forms, 
as 
in 
appetite 
of 
lust 
appeared. 
And 
the 
heresy 
of 
the 
Anthropomorphites 
was 
ever 
censured 
for 
a 
gross 
conceit 
bred 
in 
the 
obscure 
cells 
of 
solitary 
monks 
that 
never 
looked 
abroad. 
Again 
the 
fable 
so 
well 
known 
of 
QUIS 
PINXIT 
LEONEM, 
doth 
set 
forth 
well 
that 
there 
is 
an 
error 
of 
pride 
and 
partiality, 
as 
well 
as 
of 
custom 
and 
familiarity. 
The 
reflexion 
also 
from 
glasses 
so 
usually 
resembled 
to 
the 
imagery 
of 
the 
mind, 
every 
man 
knoweth 
to 
receive 
error 
and 
variety 
both 
in 
colour, 
magnitude, 
and 
shape, 
according 
to 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
glass. 
But 
yet 
no 
use 
hath 
been 
made 
of 
these 
and 
many 
the 
like 
observations, 
to 
move 
men 
to 
search 
out 
and 
upon 
search 
to 
give 
true 
cautions 
of 
the 
native 
and 
inherent 
errors 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
which 
have 
coloured 
and 
corrupted 
all 
his 
notions 
and 
impressions. 


I 
do 
find 
therefore 
in 
this 
enchanted 
glass 
four 
Idols 
or 
false 
appearances 
of 
several 
and 
distinct 
sorts, 
every 
sort 
comprehending 
many 
subdivisions: 
the 
first 
sort, 
I 
call 
idols 
of 
the 
NATION 
or 
TRIBE; 
the 
second, 
idols 
of 
the 
PALACE; 
the 
third, 
idols 
of 
the 
CAVE; 
and 
the 
fourth, 
idols 
of 
the 
THEATRE, 
etc. 


HERE 
FOLLOWETH 
AN 
ABRIDGMENT 
OF 
DIVERS 
CHAPTERS 
OF 
THE 
FIRST 
BOOK 
OF 
INTERPRETATION 
OF 
NATURE. 



Cap. 
12. 


That 
in 
deciding 
and 
determining 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
knowledge, 
men 
have 
put 
themselves 
upon 
trials 
not 
competent. 
That 
antiquity 
and 
authority; 
common 
and 
confessed 
notions; 
the 
natural 
and 
yielding 
consent 
of 
the 
mind; 
the 
harmony 
and 
coherence 
of 
a 
knowledge 
in 
itself; 
the 
establishing 
of 
principles 
with 
the 
touch 
and 
reduction 
of 
other 
propositions 
unto 
them; 
inductions 
without 
instances 
contradictory; 
and 
the 
report 
of 
the 
senses; 
are 
none 
of 
them 
absolute 
and 
infallible 
evidence 
of 
truth, 
and 
bring 
no 
security 
sufficient 
for 
effects 
and 
operations. 
That 
the 
discovery 
of 
new 
works 
and 
active 
directions 
not 
known 
before, 
is 
the 
only 
trial 
to 
be 
accepted 
of; 
and 
yet 
not 
that 
neither, 
in 
ease 
where 
one 
particular 
giveth 
light 
to 
another; 
but 
where 
particulars 
induce 
an 
axiom 
or 
observation, 
which 
axiom 
found 
out 
discovereth 
and 
designeth 
new 
particulars. 
That 
the 
nature 
of 
this 
trial 
is 
not 
only 
upon 
the 
point, 
whether 
the 
knowledge 
be 
profitable 
or 
no, 
but 
even 
upon 
the 
point 
whether 
the 
knowledge 
be 
true 
or 
no; 
not 
because 
you 
may 
always 
conclude 
that 
the 
Axiom 
which 
discovereth 
new 
instances 
is 
true, 
but 
contrariwise 
you 
may 
safely 
conclude 
that 
if 
it 
discover 
not 
any 
new 
instance 
it 
is 
in 
vain 
and 
untrue. 
That 
by 
new 
instances 
are 
not 
always 
to 
be 
understood 
new 
recipes 
but 
new 
assignations, 
and 
of 
the 
diversity 
between 
these 
two. 
That 
the 
subtilty 
of 
words, 
arguments, 
notions, 
yea 
of 
the 
senses 
themselves, 
is 
but 
rude 
and 
gross 
in 
comparison 
of 
the 
subtilty 
of 
things; 
and 
of 
the 
slothful 
and 
flattering 
opinions 
of 
those 
which 
pretend 
to 
honour 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
in 
withdrawing 
and 
abstracting 
it 
from 
particulars, 
and 
of 
the 
inducements 
and 
motives 
whereupon 
such 
opinions 
have 
been 
conceived 
and 
received. 



Cap. 
13. 


Of 
the 
error 
in 
propounding 
chiefly 
the 
search 
of 
causes 
and 
productions 
of 
things 
concrete, 
which 
are 
infinite 
and 
transitory, 
and 
not 
of 
abstract 
natures, 
which 
are 
few 
and 
permanent. 
That 
these 
natures 
are 
as 
the 
alphabet 
or 
simple 
letters, 
whereof 
the 
variety 
of 
things 
consisteth; 
or 
as 
the 
colours 
mingled 
in 
the 
painter’s 
shell, 
wherewith 
he 
is 
able 
to 
make 
infinite 
variety 
of 
faces 
or 
shapes. 
An 
enumeration 
of 
them 
according 
to 
popular 
note. 
That 
at 
the 
first 
one 
would 
conceive 
that 
in 
the 
schools 
by 
natural 
philosophy 
were 
meant 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
efficients 
of 
things 
concrete; 
and 
by 
metaphysic 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
forms 
of 
natures 
simple; 
which 
is 
a 
good 
and 
fit 
division 
of 
knowledge: 
but 
upon 
examination 
there 
is 
no 
such 
matter 
by 
them 
intended. 
That 
the 
little 
inquiry 
into 
the 
production 
of 
simple 
natures 
sheweth 
well 
that 
works 
were 
not 
sought; 
because 
by 
the 
former 
knowledge 
some 
small 
and 
superficial 
deflexions 
from 
the 
ordinary 
generations 
and 
productions 
may 
be 
found 
out, 
but 
the 
discovery 
of 
all 
profound 
and 
radical 
alteration 
must 
arise 
out 
of 
the 
latter 
knowledge. 



Cap. 
14. 


Of 
the 
error 
in 
propounding 
the 
search 
of 
the 
materials 
or 
dead 
beginnings 
or 
principles 
of 
things, 
and 
not 
the 
nature 
of 
motions, 
inclinations, 
and 
applications. 
That 
the 
whole 
scope 
of 
the 
former 
search 
is 
impertinent 
and 
vain; 
both 
because 
there 
are 
no 
such 
beginnings, 
and 
if 
there 
were 
they 
could 
not 
be 
known. 
That 
the 
latter 
manner 
of 
search 
(which 
is 
all) 
they 
pass 
over 
compendiously 
and 
slightly 
as 
a 
by-matter. 
That 
the 
several 
conceits 
in 
that 
kind, 
as 
that 
the 
lively 
and 
moving 
beginnings 
of 
things 
should 
be 
shift 
or 
appetite 
of 
matter 
to 
privation; 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
world 
working 
in 
matter 
according 
to 
platform; 
the 
proceeding 
or 
fructifying 
of 
distinct 
kinds 
according 
to 
their 
proprieties; 
the 
intercourse 
of 
the 
elements 
by 
mediation 
of 
their 
common 
qualities; 
the 
appetite 
of 
like 
portions 
to 
unite 
themselves; 
amity 
and 
discord, 
or 
sympathy 
and 
antipathy; 
motion 
to 
the 
centre, 
with 
motion 
of 
stripe 
or 
press; 
the 
casual 
agitation, 
aggregation, 
and 
essays 
of 
the 
solid 
portions 
in 
the 
void 
space; 
motion 
of 
shuttings 
and 
openings; 
are 
all 
mere 
nugations; 
and 
that 
the 
calculating 
and 
ordination 
of 
the 
true 
degrees, 
moments, 
limits, 
and 
laws 
of 
motions 
and 
alterations 
(by 
means 
whereof 
all 
works 
and 
effects 
are 
produced), 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
a 
far 
other 
nature 
than 
to 
consist 
in 
such 
easy 
and 
wild 
generalities. 



Cap. 
15. 


Of 
the 
great 
error 
of 
inquiring 
knowledge 
in 
Anticipations. 
That 
I 
call 
Anticipations 
the 
voluntary 
collections 
that 
the 
mind 
maketh 
of 
knowledge; 
which 
is 
every 
man’s 
reason. 
That 
though 
this 
be 
a 
solemn 
thing, 
and 
serves 
the 
turn 
to 
negotiate 
between 
man 
and 
man 
(because 
of 
the 
conformity 
and 
participation 
of 
men’s 
minds 
in 
the 
like 
errors), 
yet 
towards 
inquiry 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
things 
and 
works 
it 
is 
of 
no 
value. 
That 
civil 
respects 
are 
a 
lett 
that 
this 
pretended 
reason 
should 
not 
be 
so 
contemptibly 
spoken 
of 
as 
were 
fit 
and 
medicinable, 
in 
regard 
that 
hath 
been 
too 
much 
exalted 
and 
glorified, 
to 
the 
infinite 
detriment 
of 
man’s 
estate. 
Of 
the 
nature 
of 
words 
and 
their 
facility 
and 
aptness 
to 
cover 
and 
grace 
the 
defects 
of 
Anticipations. 
That 
it 
is 
no 
marvel 
if 
these 
Anticipations 
have 
brought 
forth 
such 
diversity 
and 
repugnance 
in 
opinions, 
theories, 
or 
philosophies, 
as 
so 
many 
fables 
of 
several 
arguments. 
That 
had 
not 
the 
nature 
of 
civil 
customs 
and 
government 
been 
in 
most 
times 
somewhat 
adverse 
to 
such 
innovations, 
though 
contemplative, 
there 
might 
have 
been 
and 
would 
have 
been 
many 
more. 
That 
the 
second 
school 
of 
the 
Academics 
and 
the 
sect 
of 
Pyrrho, 
or 
the 
considerers 
that 
denied 
comprehension, 
as 
to 
the 
disabling 
of 
man’s 
knowledge 
(entertained 
in 
Anticipations) 
is 
well 
to 
be 
allowed, 
but 
that 
they 
ought 
when 
they 
had 
overthrown 
and 
purged 
the 
floor 
of 
the 
ruins 
to 
have 
sought 
to 
build 
better 
in 
place. 
And 
more 
especially 
that 
they 
did 
unjustly 
and 
prejudicially 
to 
charge 
the 
deceit 
upon 
the 
report 
of 
the 
senses, 
which 
admitteth 
very 
sparing 
remedy; 
being 
indeed 
to 
have 
been 
charged 
upon 
the 
Anticipations 
of 
the 
mind, 
which 
admitteth 
a 
perfect 
remedy. 
That 
the 
information 
of 
the 
senses 
is 
sufficient, 
not 
because 
they 
err 
not, 
but 
because 
the 
use 
of 
the 
sense 
in 
discovering 
of 
knowledge 
is 
for 
the 
most 
part 
not 
immediate. 
So 
that 
it 
is 
the 
work, 
effect, 
or 
instance, 
that 
trieth 
the 
Axiom, 
and 
the 
sense 
doth 
but 
try 
the 
work 
done 
or 
not 
done, 
being 
or 
not 
being. 
That 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
in 
collecting 
knowledge 
needeth 
great 
variety 
of 
helps, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
hand 
of 
man 
in 
manual 
and 
mechanical 
practices 
needeth 
great 
variety 
of 
instruments. 
And 
that 
it 
were 
a 
poor 
work 
that 
if 
instruments 
were 
removed 
men 
would 
overcome 
with 
their 
naked 
hands. 
And 
of 
the 
distinct 
points 
of 
want 
and 
insufficiency 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
man. 



Cap. 
16. 


That 
the 
mind 
of 
a 
man, 
as 
it 
is 
not 
a 
vessel 
of 
that 
content 
or 
receipt 
to 
comprehend 
knowledge 
without 
helps 
and 
supplies, 
so 
again 
it 
is 
not 
sincere, 
but 
of 
an 
ill 
and 
corrupt 
tincture. 
Of 
the 
inherent 
and 
profound 
errors 
and 
superstitions 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
mind, 
and 
of 
the 
four 
sorts 
of 
Idols 
or 
false 
appearances 
that 
offer 
themselves 
to 
the 
understanding 
in 
the 
inquisition 
of 
knowledge; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
Idols 
of 
the 
Tribe, 
the 
Idols 
of 
the 
Palace, 
the 
Idols 
of 
the 
Cave, 
and 
the 
Idols 
of 
the 
Theatre. 
That 
these 
four, 
added 
to 
the 
incapacity 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
the 
vanity 
and 
malignity 
of 
the 
affections, 
leave 
nothing 
but 
impotency 
and 
confusion. 
A 
recital 
of 
the 
particular 
kinds 
of 
these 
four 
Idols, 
with 
some 
chosen 
examples 
of 
the 
opinions 
they 
have 
begot, 
such 
of 
them 
as 
have 
supplanted 
the 
state 
of 
knowledge 
most. 



Cap. 
17. 


Of 
the 
errors 
of 
such 
as 
have 
descended 
and 
applied 
themselves 
to 
experience, 
and 
attempted 
to 
induce 
knowledge 
upon 
particulars. 
That 
they 
have 
not 
had 
the 
resolution 
and 
strength 
of 
mind 
to 
free 
themselves 
wholly 
from 
Anticipations, 
but 
have 
made 
a 
confusion 
and 
intermixture 
of 
Anticipations 
and 
observations, 
and 
so 
vanished. 
That 
if 
any 
have 
had 
the 
strength 
of 
mind 
generally 
to 
purge 
away 
and 
discharge 
all 
Anticipations, 
they 
have 
not 
had 
that 
greater 
and 
double 
strength 
and 
patience 
of 
mind, 
as 
well 
to 
repel 
new 
Anticipations 
after 
the 
view 
and 
search 
of 
particulars, 
as 
to 
reject 
old 
which 
were 
in 
their 
mind 
before; 
but 
have 
from 
particulars 
and 
history 
flown 
up 
to 
principles 
without 
the 
mean 
degrees, 
and 
so 
framed 
all 
the 
middle 
generalities 
or 
axioms, 
not 
by 
way 
of 
scale 
or 
ascension 
from 
particulars, 
but 
by 
way 
of 
derivation 
from 
principles; 
whence 
hath 
issued 
the 
infinite 
chaos 
of 
shadows 
and 
notions, 
wherewith 
both 
books 
and 
minds 
have 
been 
hitherto, 
and 
may 
be 
yet 
hereafter 
much 
more 
pestered. 
That 
in 
the 
course 
of 
those 
derivations, 
to 
make 
them 
yet 
the 
more 
unprofitable, 
they 
have 
used 
when 
any 
light 
of 
new 
instance 
opposite 
to 
any 
assertion 
appeared, 
rather 
to 
reconcile 
the 
instance 
than 
to 
amend 
the 
rule. 
That 
if 
any 
have 
had 
or 
shall 
have 
the 
power 
and 
resolution 
to 
fortify 
and 
inclose 
his 
mind 
against 
all 
Anticipations, 
yet 
if 
he 
have 
not 
been 
or 
shall 
not 
be 
cautioned 
by 
the 
full 
understanding 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
spirit 
of 
man, 
and 
therein 
of 
the 
seats, 
pores 
and 
passages 
both 
of 
knowledge 
and 
error, 
he 
hath 
not 
been 
nor 
shall 
not 
be 
possibly 
able 
to 
guide 
or 
keep 
on 
his 
course 
aright. 
That 
those 
that 
have 
been 
conversant 
in 
experience 
and 
observation 
have 
used, 
when 
they 
have 
intended 
to 
discover 
the 
cause 
of 
any 
effect, 
to 
fix 
their 
consideration 
narrowly 
and 
exactly 
upon 
that 
effect 
itself 
with 
all 
the 
circumstances 
thereof, 
and 
to 
vary 
the 
trial 
thereof 
as 
many 
ways 
as 
can 
be 
devised; 
which 
course 
amounteth 
but 
to 
a 
tedious 
curiosity, 
and 
ever 
breaketh 
off 
in 
wondering 
and 
not 
in 
knowing; 
and 
that 
they 
have 
not 
used 
to 
enlarge 
their 
observation 
to 
match 
and 
sort 
that 
effect 
with 
instances 
of 
a 
diverse 
subject, 
which 
must 
of 
necessity 
be 
before 
any 
cause 
be 
found 
out. 
That 
they 
have 
passed 
over 
the 
observation 
of 
instances 
vulgar 
and 
ignoble, 
and 
stayed 
their 
attention 
chiefly 
upon 
instances 
of 
mark; 
whereas 
the 
other 
sort 
are 
for 



the 
most 
part 
more 
significant 
and 
of 
better 
height 
and 
information. 
That 
every 
particular 
that 
worketh 
any 
effect 
is 
a 
thing 
compounded 
(more 
or 
less) 
of 
diverse 
single 
natures, 
(more 
manifest 
and 
more 
obscure,) 
and 
that 
it 
appeareth 
not 
to 
whether 
of 
the 
natures 
the 
effect 
is 
to 
be 
ascribed, 
and 
yet 
notwithstanding 
they 
have 
taken 
a 
course 
without 
breaking 
particulars 
and 
reducing 
them 
by 
exclusions 
and 
inclusions 
to 
a 
definite 
point, 
to 
conclude 
upon 
inductions 
in 
gross, 
which 
empirical 
course 
is 
no 
less 
vain 
than 
the 
scholastical. 
That 
all 
such 
as 
have 
sought 
action 
and 
work 
out 
of 
their 
inquiry 
have 
been 
hasty 
and 
pressing 
to 
discover 
some 
practices 
for 
present 
use, 
and 
not 
to 
discover 
Axioms, 
joining 
with 
them 
the 
new 
assignations 
as 
their 
sureties. 
That 
the 
forerunning 
of 
the 
mind 
to 
frame 
recipes 
upon 
Axioms 
at 
the 
entrance, 
is 
like 
Atalanta’s 
golden 
ball 
that 
hindereth 
and 
interrupteth 
the 
course, 
and 
is 
to 
be 
inhibited 
till 
you 
have 
ascended 
to 
a 
certain 
stage 
and 
degree 
of 
generalities; 
which 
forbearance 
will 
be 
liberally 
recompensed 
in 
the 
end; 
and 
that 
chance 
discovereth 
new 
inventions 
by 
one 
and 
one, 
but 
science 
by 
knots 
and 
clusters. 
That 
they 
have 
not 
collected 
sufficient 
quantity 
of 
particulars, 
nor 
them 
in 
sufficient 
certainty 
and 
subtilty, 
nor 
of 
all 
several 
kinds, 
nor 
with 
those 
advantages 
and 
discretions 
in 
the 
entry 
and 
sorting 
which 
are 
requisite; 
and 
of 
the 
weak 
manner 
of 
collecting 
natural 
history 
which 
hath 
been 
used. 
Lastly 
that 
they 
had 
no 
knowledge 
of 
the 
formulary 
of 
interpretation, 
the 
work 
whereof 
is 
to 
abridge 
experience 
and 
to 
make 
things 
as 
certainly 
found 
out 
by 
Axiom 
in 
short 
time, 
as 
by 
infinite 
experiences 
in 
ages. 



Cap. 
18. 


That 
the 
cautels 
and 
devices 
put 
in 
practice 
in 
the 
delivery 
of 
knowledge 
for 
the 
covering 
and 
palliating 
of 
ignorance, 
and 
the 
gracing 
and 
overvaluing 
of 
that 
they 
utter, 
are 
without 
number; 
but 
none 
more 
bold 
and 
more 
hurtful 
than 
two; 
the 
one 
that 
men 
have 
used 
of 
a 
few 
observations 
upon 
any 
subject 
to 
make 
a 
solemn 
and 
formal 
art, 
by 
filling 
it 
up 
with 
discourse, 
accommodating 
it 
with 
some 
circumstances 
and 
directions 
to 
practice, 
and 
digesting 
it 
into 
method, 
whereby 
men 
grow 
satisfied 
and 
secure, 
as 
if 
no 
more 
inquiry 
were 
to 
be 
made 
of 
that 
matter; 
the 
other, 
that 
men 
have 
used 
to 
discharge 
ignorance 
with 
credit, 
in 
defining 
all 
those 
effects 
which 
they 
cannot 
attain 
unto 
to 
be 
out 
of 
the 
compass 
of 
art 
and 
human 
endeavour. 
That 
the 
very 
styles 
and 
forms 
of 
utterance 
are 
so 
many 
characters 
of 
imposture, 
some 
choosing 
a 
style 
of 
pugnacity 
and 
contention, 
some 
of 
satire 
and 
reprehension, 
some 
of 
plausible 
and 
tempting 
similitudes 
and 
examples, 
some 
of 
great 
words 
and 
high 
discourse, 
some 
of 
short 
and 
dark 
sentences, 
some 
of 
exactness 
of 
method, 
all 
of 
positive 
affirmation, 
without 
disclosing 
the 
true 
motives 
and 
proofs 
of 
their 
opinions, 
or 
free 
confessing 
their 
ignorance 
or 
doubts, 
except 
it 
be 
now 
and 
then 
for 
a 
grace, 
and 
in 
cunning 
to 
win 
the 
more 
credit 
in 
the 
rest, 
and 
not 
in 
good 
faith. 
That 
although 
men 
be 
free 
from 
these 
errors 
and 
incumbrances 
in 
the 
will 
and 
affection, 
yet 
it 
is 
not 
a 
thing 
so 
easy 
as 
is 
conceived 
to 
convey 
the 
conceit 
of 
one 
man’s 
mind 
into 
the 
mind 
of 
another 
without 
loss 
or 
mistaking, 
specially 
in 
notions 
new 
and 
differing 
from 
those 
that 
are 
received. 
That 
never 
any 
knowledge 
was 
delivered 
in 
the 
same 
order 
it 
was 
invented, 
no 
not 
in 
the 
mathematic, 
though 
it 
should 
seem 
otherwise 
in 
regard 
that 
the 
propositions 
placed 
last 
do 
use 
the 
propositions 
or 
grants 
placed 
first 
for 
their 
proof 
and 
demonstration. 
That 
there 
are 
forms 
and 
methods 
of 
tradition 
wholly 
distinct 
and 
differing, 
according 
to 
their 
ends 
whereto 
they 
are 
directed. 
That 
there 
are 
two 
ends 
of 
tradition 
of 
knowledge, 
the 
one 
to 
teach 
and 
instruct 
for 
use 
and 
practice, 
the 
other 
to 
impart 
or 
intimate 
for 
re-examination 
and 
progression. 
That 
the 
former 
of 
these 
ends 
requireth 
a 
method 
not 
the 
same 
whereby 
it 
was 
invented 
and 
induced, 
but 
such 
as 
is 
most 
compendious 
and 
ready 
whereby 
it 
may 
be 
used 
and 
applied. 
That 
the 
latter 
of 
the 
ends, 
which 



is 
where 
a 
knowledge 
is 
delivered 
to 
be 
continued 
and 
spun 
on 
by 
a 
succession 
of 
labours, 
requireth 
a 
method 
whereby 
it 
may 
be 
transposed 
to 
another 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
it 
was 
collected, 
to 
the 
end 
it 
may 
be 
discerned 
both 
where 
the 
work 
is 
weak, 
and 
where 
it 
breaketh 
off. 
That 
this 
latter 
method 
is 
not 
only 
unfit 
for 
the 
former 
end, 
but 
also 
impossible 
for 
all 
knowledge 
gathered 
and 
insinuated 
by 
Anticipations, 
because 
the 
mind 
working 
inwardly 
of 
itself, 
no 
man 
can 
give 
a 
just 
account 
how 
he 
came 
to 
that 
knowledge 
which 
he 
hath 
received, 
and 
that 
therefore 
this 
method 
is 
peculiar 
for 
knowledge 
gathered 
by 
interpretation. 
That 
the 
discretion 
anciently 
observed, 
though 
by 
the 
precedent 
of 
many 
vain 
persons 
and 
deceivers 
disgraced, 
of 
publishing 
part, 
and 
reserving 
part 
to 
a 
private 
succession, 
and 
of 
publishing 
in 
a 
manner 
whereby 
it 
shall 
not 
be 
to 
the 
capacity 
nor 
taste 
of 
all, 
but 
shall 
as 
it 
were 
single 
and 
adopt 
his 
reader, 
is 
not 
to 
be 
laid 
aside, 
both 
for 
the 
avoiding 
of 
abuse 
in 
the 
excluded, 
and 
the 
stregthening 
of 
affection 
in 
the 
admitted. 
That 
there 
are 
other 
virtues 
of 
tradition, 
as 
that 
there 
be 
no 
occasion 
given 
to 
error, 
and 
that 
it 
carry 
a 
vigour 
to 
root 
and 
spread 
against 
the 
vanity 
of 
wits 
and 
injuries 
of 
time; 
all 
which 
if 
they 
were 
ever 
due 
to 
any 
knowledge 
delivered, 
or 
if 
they 
were 
never 
due 
to 
any 
human 
knowledge 
heretofore 
delivered, 
yet 
are 
now 
due 
to 
the 
knowledge 
propounded. 



Cap. 
19. 


Of 
the 
impediments 
which 
have 
been 
in 
the 
affections, 
the 
principle 
whereof 
hath 
been 
despair 
or 
diffidence, 
and 
the 
strong 
apprehension 
of 
the 
difficulty, 
obscurity, 
and 
infiniteness 
which 
belongeth 
to 
the 
invention 
of 
knowledge, 
and 
that 
men 
have 
not 
known 
their 
own 
strength, 
and 
that 
the 
supposed 
difficulties 
and 
vastness 
of 
the 
work 
is 
rather 
in 
shew 
and 
muster 
than 
in 
state 
or 
substance 
where 
the 
true 
way 
is 
taken. 
That 
this 
diffidence 
hath 
moved 
and 
caused 
some 
never 
to 
enter 
into 
search, 
and 
others 
when 
they 
have 
been 
entered 
either 
to 
give 
over 
or 
to 
seek 
a 
more 
compendious 
course 
than 
can 
stand 
with 
the 
nature 
of 
true 
search. 
That 
of 
those 
that 
have 
refused 
and 
prejudged 
inquiry, 
the 
more 
sober 
and 
grave 
sort 
of 
wits 
have 
depended 
upon 
authors 
and 
traditions, 
and 
the 
more 
vain 
and 
credulous 
resorted 
to 
revelation 
and 
intelligence 
with 
spirits 
and 
higher 
natures. 
That 
of 
those 
that 
have 
entered 
into 
search, 
some 
having 
fallen 
upon 
some 
conceits 
which 
they 
after 
consider 
to 
be 
the 
same 
which 
they 
have 
found 
in 
former 
authors, 
have 
suddenly 
taken 
a 
persuasion 
that 
a 
man 
shall 
but 
with 
much 
labour 
incur 
and 
light 
upon 
the 
same 
inventions 
which 
he 
might 
with 
ease 
receive 
from 
others; 
and 
that 
it 
is 
but 
a 
vanity 
and 
self-pleasing 
of 
the 
wit 
to 
go 
about 
again, 
as 
one 
that 
would 
rather 
have 
a 
flower 
of 
his 
own 
gathering, 
than 
much 
better 
gathered 
to 
his 
hand. 
That 
the 
same 
humour 
of 
sloth 
and 
diffidence 
suggesteth 
that 
a 
man 
shall 
but 
revive 
some 
ancient 
opinion, 
which 
was 
long 
ago 
propounded, 
examined, 
and 
rejected. 
And 
that 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
err 
in 
conceit 
that 
a 
man’s 
observation 
or 
notion 
is 
the 
same 
with 
a 
former 
opinion, 
both 
because 
new 
conceits 
must 
of 
necessity 
be 
uttered 
in 
old 
words, 
and 
because 
upon 
true 
and 
erroneous 
grounds 
men 
may 
meet 
in 
consequence 
or 
conclusion, 
as 
several 
lines 
or 
circles 
that 
cut 
in 
some 
one 
point. 
That 
the 
greatest 
part 
of 
those 
that 
have 
descended 
into 
search 
have 
chosen 
for 
the 
most 
artificial 
and 
compendious 
course 
to 
induce 
principles 
out 
of 
particulars, 
and 
to 
reduce 
all 
other 
propositions 
unto 
principles; 
and 
so 
instead 
of 
the 
nearest 
way, 
have 
been 
led 
to 
no 
way 
or 
a 
mere 
labyrinth. 
That 
the 
two 
contemplative 
ways 
have 
some 
resemblance 
with 
the 
old 
parable 
of 
the 
two 
moral 
ways, 
the 
one 
beginning 
with 
incertainty 
and 
difficulty, 
and 
ending 
in 
plainness 
and 
certainty, 
and 
the 
other 
beginning 
with 
shew 
of 
plainness 
and 



certainty, 
and 
ending 
in 
difficulty 
and 
incertainty. 
Of 
the 
great 
and 
manifest 
error 
and 
untrue 
conceit 
or 
estimation 
of 
the 
infiniteness 
of 
particulars, 
whereas 
indeed 
all 
prolixity 
is 
in 
discourse 
and 
derivations; 
and 
of 
the 
infinite 
and 
most 
laborious 
expense 
of 
wit 
that 
hath 
been 
employed 
upon 
toys 
and 
matters 
of 
no 
fruit 
or 
value. 
That 
although 
the 
period 
of 
one 
age 
cannot 
advance 
men 
to 
the 
furthest 
point 
of 
interpretation 
of 
nature, 
(except 
the 
work 
should 
be 
undertaken 
with 
greater 
helps 
than 
can 
be 
expected), 
yet 
it 
cannot 
fail 
in 
much 
less 
space 
of 
time 
to 
make 
return 
of 
many 
singular 
commodities 
towards 
the 
state 
and 
occasions 
of 
man’s 
life. 
That 
there 
is 
less 
reason 
of 
distrust 
in 
the 
course 
of 
interpretation 
now 
propounded 
than 
in 
any 
knowledge 
formerly 
delivered, 
because 
this 
course 
doth 
in 
sort 
equal 
men’s 
wits, 
and 
leaveth 
no 
great 
advantage 
or 
preeminence 
to 
the 
perfect 
and 
excellent 
motions 
of 
the 
spirit. 
That 
to 
draw 
a 
straight 
line 
or 
to 
make 
a 
circle 
perfect 
round 
by 
aim 
of 
hand 
only, 
there 
must 
be 
a 
great 
difference 
between 
an 
unsteady 
and 
unpractised 
hand 
and 
a 
steady 
and 
practised, 
but 
to 
do 
it 
by 
rule 
or 
compass 
it 
is 
much 
alike. 



Cap.

Of 
the 
impediments 
which 
have 
been 
in 
the 
two 
extreme 
humours 
of 
admiration 
of 
antiquity 
and 
love 
of 
novelty, 
and 
again 
of 
over-servile 
reverence 
or 
over-light 
scorn 
of 
the 
opinions 
of 
others. 



Cap. 
22. 


Of 
the 
impediments 
which 
have 
been 
in 
the 
affection 
of 
pride, 
specially 
of 
one 
kind, 
which 
is 
the 
disdain 
of 
dwelling 
and 
being 
conversant 
much 
in 
experiences 
and 
particulars, 
specially 
such 
as 
are 
vulgar 
in 
occurrency, 
and 
base 
and 
ignoble 
in 
use. 
That 
besides 
certain 
higher 
mysteries 
of 
pride, 
generalities 
seem 
to 
have 
a 
dignity 
and 
solemnity, 
in 
that 
they 
do 
not 
put 
men 
in 
mind 
of 
their 
familiar 
actions, 
in 
that 
they 
have 
less 
affinity 
with 
arts 
mechanical 
and 
illiberal, 
in 
that 
they 
are 
not 
so 
subject 
to 
be 
controlled 
by 
persons 
of 
mean 
observation, 
in 
that 
they 
seem 
to 
teach 
men 
that 
they 
know 
not, 
and 
not 
to 
refer 
them 
to 
that 
they 
know. 
All 
which 
conditions 
directly 
feeding 
the 
humour 
of 
pride, 
particulars 
do 
want. 
That 
the 
majesty 
of 
generalities, 
and 
the 
divine 
nature 
of 
the 
mind 
in 
taking 
them 
(if 
they 
be 
truly 
collected, 
and 
be 
indeed 
the 
direct 
reflexions 
of 
things,) 
cannot 
be 
too 
much 
magnified. 
And 
that 
it 
is 
true 
that 
interpretation 
is 
the 
very 
natural 
and 
direct 
intention, 
action, 
and 
progression 
of 
the 
understanding 
delivered 
from 
impediments. 
And 
that 
all 
Anticipation 
is 
but 
a 
deflexion 
or 
declination 
by 
accident. 



Cap. 
25. 


Of 
the 
impediments 
which 
have 
been 
in 
the 
state 
of 
heathen 
religion 
and 
other 
superstitions 
and 
errors 
of 
religion. 
And 
that 
in 
the 
true 
religion 
there 
hath 
not 
nor 
is 
any 
impediment, 
except 
it 
be 
by 
accident 
or 
intermixture 
of 
humour. 
That 
a 
religion 
which 
consisteth 
in 
rites 
and 
forms 
of 
adoration, 
and 
not 
in 
confessions 
and 
beliefs, 
is 
adverse 
to 
knowledge; 
because 
men 
having 
liberty 
to 
inquire 
and 
discourse 
of 
Theology 
at 
pleasure, 
it 
cometh 
to 
pass 
that 
all 
inquisition 
of 
nature 
endeth 
and 
limiteth 
itself 
in 
such 
metaphysical 
or 
theological 
discourse; 
whereas 
if 
men’s 
wits 
be 
shut 
out 
of 
that 
port, 
it 
turneth 
them 
again 
to 
discover, 
and 
so 
to 
seek 
reason 
of 
reason 
more 
deeply. 
And 
that 
such 
was 
the 
religion 
of 
the 
Heathen. 
That 
a 
religion 
that 
is 
jealous 
of 
the 
variety 
of 
learning, 
discourse, 
opinions, 
and 
sects, 
(as 
misdoubting 
it 
may 
shake 
the 
foundations,) 
or 
that 
cherisheth 
devotion 
upon 
simplicity 
and 
ignorance, 
as 
ascribing 
ordinary 
effects 
to 
the 
immediate 
working 
of 
God, 
is 
adverse 
to 
knowledge. 
That 
such 
is 
the 
religion 
of 
the 
Turk, 
and 
such 
hath 
been 
the 
abuse 
of 
Christian 
religion 
at 
some 
several 
times, 
and 
in 
some 
several 
factions. 
And 
of 
the 
singular 
advantage 
which 
the 
Christian 
religion 
hath 
towards 
the 
furtherance 
of 
true 
knowledge, 
in 
that 
it 
excludeth 
and 
interdicteth 
human 
reason, 
whether 
by 
interpretation 
or 
anticipation, 
from 
examining 
or 
discussing 
of 
the 
mysteries 
and 
principles 
of 
faith. 



Cap. 
26. 


Of 
the 
impediments 
which 
have 
been 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
society 
and 
the 
policies 
of 
state. 
That 
there 
is 
no 
composition 
of 
estate 
or 
society, 
nor 
order 
or 
quality 
of 
persons, 
which 
have 
not 
some 
point 
of 
contrariety 
towards 
true 
knowledge. 
That 
monarchies 
incline 
wits 
to 
profit 
and 
pleasure, 
and 
commonwealths 
to 
glory 
and 
vanity. 
That 
universities 
incline 
wits 
to 
sophistry 
and 
affectation, 
cloisters 
to 
fables 
and 
unprofitable 
subtilty, 
study 
at 
large 
to 
variety; 
and 
that 
it 
is 
hard 
to 
say, 
whether 
mixture 
of 
contemplations 
with 
an 
active 
life, 
or 
retiring 
wholly 
to 
contemplations, 
do 
disable 
and 
hinder 
the 
mind 
more.
