PREFACE 


IT 
IS 
SCARCELY 
ELEVEN 
YEARS 
since 
Freud 
died 
in 
London. 
When 
I 
now 
read 
presentations 
of 
his 
work 
in 
books 
and 
articles, 
I 
am 
often 
reminded 
of 
a 
little 
storyI 
heard 
as 
a 
boy 
in 
Vienna. 
Thefather 
of 
a 
peasanthaddied 
and 
theson, 
an 
Austrian 
Peter 
Simpleton, 
wished 
to 
possess 
a 
picture 
of 
the 
dear 
deceased 
man. 
TheboywanderedtoVienna, 
foundawell-knownpainteranddescribed 
to 
the 
artist 
what 
the 
father 
looked 
like, 
giving 
full 
details 
of 
the 
shape 
of 
the 
face, 
the 
colors 
of 
hair 
and 
eyes 
a.s.o. 
The 
painter 
promised 
to 
deliver 
the 
picture. 
When 
the 
naive 
boy 
returned 
to 
the 
studio 
after 
a 
few 
weeks, 
he 
brokeintosobsbeforethe 
finished 
portrait 
and 
cried: 
“Poor 
father,how 
much 
you 
have 
changed 
in 
such 
a 
short 
time!” 
Reading 
many 
books 
and 
magazine 
articles 
of 
those 
last 
years 
that 
pretend 
to 
give 
a 
correct 
picture 
of 
Freud’s 
ideas 
and 
teachings 
amazes 
us, 
who 
have 
known 
the 
great 
man: 
how 
much 
histhoughtshavechanged 
insuchashorttime! 


Fortunately 
we 
have 
the 
possibility 
to 
study 
his 
work 
in 
the 
original. 
To 
remain 
within 
the 
simile, 
he 
has 
left 
us 
a 
magnificent 
self-portrait 
in 
those 
thirteenvolumesofhiswritings. 


The 
discussion 
about 
psychoanalysis 
among 
physicians 
and 
laymen 
(many 
of 
the 
first 
group 
belong 
also 
to 
the 
second) 
is 
rather 
increasing 
than 
diminishing. 
Everybody 
who 
has 
studied 
psychoanalysis 
thoroughly 
has, 
of 
course, 
the 
right 
to 
criticize 
the 
opinions 
of 
Freud. 
Nobody 
has 
the 
right 
to 
distortandmisrepresentthem. 
There 
ought 
tobealaw! 


This 
book 
will 
help 
to 
correct 
the 
abundant 
misunderstandings 
and 
misconceptions 
among 
the 
intelligent 
people 
interested 
in 
psychoanalysis. 
Presenting 
Freud’s 
ideas 
in 
quotations 
from 
his 
own 
work, 
the 
editors 
have 
given 
a 
kind 
of 
dictionary 
which 
can 
secure 
authentic 
information 
on 
the 
most 
important 
topics 
of 
psychoanalysis 
to 
the 
student 
who 
is 
in 
doubt. 
Such 
a 
dictionary 
is, 
of 
course, 
not 
to 
be 
used 
as 
a 
textbook 
of 
psychoanalysis. 
It 
can 
ratherbeusedtocorrectmanytextbooks, 
nowprinted. 


It 
has 
become 
customary 
nowadays 
that 
the 
preface 
of 
a 
book 
should 
praise 
it 
in 
glowing 
terms, 
announce 
its 
publication 
with 
fanfare. 
(It 
is 
a 
custom 
more 
honour’d 
in 
the 
breach 
than 
the 
observance.) 
It 
is, 
it 
seems 
to 



me, 
sufficient 
to 
recommend 
its 
value 
to 
the 
intelligent 
reader. 
The 
editors 
of 
this 
book 
know, 
I 
am 
sure, 
that 
it 
is 
as 
imperfect 
as 
other 
scientific 
endeavors 
of 
this 
kind. 
They 
are 
willing, 
no, 
more 
than 
this, 
they 
are 
eager 
to 
augment 
and 
correct 
it, 
to 
fill 
gaps 
in 
later 
editions 
which 
will 
become 
necessary 
because 
the 
merits 
of 
such 
a 
work 
will 
soon 
be 
recognized 
by 
the 
students 
of 
psychoanalysis. 


Greek 
mythology 
tells 
the 
story 
of 
the 
Augean 
stable 
wherein 
three 
thousand 
oxen 
were 
kept 
and 
which 
remained 
uncleaned 
for 
thirty 
years. 
The 
misconceptions 
and 
distortions, 
the 
falsifications 
and 
misrepresentations 
to 
which 
psychoanalysis 
was 
subjected 
in 
its 
popularization 
threaten 
to 
transform 
the 
magnificent 
house 
that 
Freud 
built 
into 
a 
stable 
similar 
to 
that 
of 
King 
Augeas. 
It 
too 
was 
not 
cleaned 
for 
thirty 
years 
and 
was, 
alas, 
frequented 
by 
more 
than 
3000 
oxen 
in 
this 
time. 
To 
clean 
it 
is 
a 
task 
compared 
with 
which 
Hercules 
had 
an 
easy 
job. 
The 
editors 
of 
this 
book 
have 
attempted 
to 
sweep 
at 
least 
a 
corner 
of 
this 
wide 
hall. 
Their 
endeavor 
is 
worthyof 
sincere 
acknowledgment.

INTRODUCTION 


THIS 
ISABOOK 
that 
should 
satisfy 
alongfelt 
need. 
Freud’s 
writings 
comprise 
a 
small 
library. 
To 
know 
how 
the 
founder 
of 
psychoanalysis 
defined 
his 
original 
terms, 
how 
he 
changed 
or 
amplified 
them 
in 
his 
later 
writings; 
to 
have 
his 
exact 
statements 
at 
hand 
on 
all 
possible 
psychoanalytic 
questions 
will 
be 
of 
considerable 
assistance 
to 
students 
and 
practitioners 
alike. 
Some 
analysts, 
known 
as 
specialists 
in 
Freudian 
quotations, 
have 
been 
receiving 
constant 
requests 
to 
supply 
references 
to 
those 
who 
sorely 
needed 
them. 
This 
book 
will 
safeguard 
them 
from 
the 
penalty 
of 
specialization, 
and 
will 
place 
all 
Freudiana 
within 
easy 
reach 
of 
professional 
and 
non-professional 
researchers. 


Every 
possible 
care 
was 
taken 
to 
preserve 
the 
context 
of 
the 
original 
definitions 
and 
to 
present, 
in 
sub-headings, 
the 
varieties 
of 
application. 
The 
books 
from 
which 
the 
quotations 
are 
taken 
are 
easy 
to 
identify. 
Page 
references 
within 
the 
chapters 
have 
been 
avoided 
owing 
to 
the 
confusion 
which 
the 
pluralityofeditionswouldcreate.

AGORAPHOBIA—The 
sufferer 
from 
agoraphobia 
imposes 
a 
restriction 
upon 
his 
ego 
in 
order 
to 
escape 
an 
instinctual 
danger. 
The 
instinctual 
danger 
in 
question 
is 
the 
temptation 
to 
yieldtohis 
erotic 
desires; 
and 
to 
yieldtothem 
would 
be 
to 
reincarnate 
once 
again, 
as 
in 
childhood, 
the 
specter 
of 
the 
danger 
of 
castration 
or 
of 
an 
analogous 
danger. 
As 
an 
example 
I 
may 
refer 
to 
the 
case 
of 
a 
young 
man 
who 
became 
agoraphobic 
because 
he 
was 
afraid 
of 
yielding 
to 
the 
allurements 
of 
prostitutes 
and 
of 
acquiring 
syphilis 
as 
a 
punishment. 
The 
symptomatology 
of 
agoraphobia 
is 
complicated 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
ego 
is 
not 
content 
with 
renouncing-something; 
in 
addition 
to 
this, 
it 
takes 
steps 
to 
deprive 
the 
situation 
of 
its 
danger. 
This 
additional 
measure 
is 
usually 
a 
regression 
to 
childhood 
(in 
extreme 
cases, 
to 
the 
uterus, 
to 
a 
period 
when 
one 
was 
protected 
against 
the 
dangers 
which 
threaten 
today); 
the 
regression 
constitutes 
the 
condition 
under 
which 
the 
renunciation 
need 
not 
be 
made. 
Thus 
the 
agoraphobic 
may 
go 
on 
the 
street 
provided 
that, 
like 
a 
small 
child, 
he 
is 
accompanied 
by 
a 
person 
in 
whom 
he 
has 
full 
confidence. 
A 
similar 
caution 
may 
also 
permit 
him 
to 
go 
out 
alone, 
provided 
that 
he 
does 
not 
go 
more 
than 
a 
certain 
distance 
away 
from 
home, 
that 
he 
does 
not 
enter 
localities 
which 
he 
does 
not 
know 
well

AMBIVALENCE—This

can 
already

itself 
throughout

draws 
to 
itself 
a

part

activity. 
The 
dominance 
of 
sadism

the 
rôle 
of 
the 
cloaca 
of 
the 
anal

stamps 
it 
with 
an 
exquisitely 
archaic 
impression. 
As 
another 
characteristic 
belonging

can 
mention 
the 
fact 
that 
the

Amnesia, 
Hysterical 
and 
Infantile, 
Compared—We 
shall 
not, 
however, 
hesitate 
to 
assert 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
infantile 
amnesia 
gives 
us 
a 
new 
point 
of 
comparison 
between 
the 
psychic 
states 
of 
the 
child 
and 
those 
of 
the 
psychoneurotic. 
We 
have 
already 
encountered 
another 
point 
of 
comparison 
when 
confronted 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
sexuality 
of 
the 
psychoneurotic 
preserves 
the 
infantile 
character 
or 
has 
returned 
to 
it. 
May 
there 
not 
be 
an 
ultimate 
connectionbetween 
theinfantileand 
the 
hystericalamnesias? 


The 
connection 
between 
infantile 
and 
hysterical 
amnesias 
is 
really 
more 
than 
a 
mere 
play 
of 
wit. 
Hysterical 
amnesia 
which 
serves 
the 
repression 
can 
only 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
individual 
already 
possesses 
a 
sum 
of 
memories 
which 
were 
withdrawn 
from 
conscious 
disposal 
and 
which 
by 
associative 
connection 
now 
seize 
that 
which 
is 
acted 
upon 
by 
the 
repelling 
forces 
of 
the 
repression 
emanating 
from 
consciousness. 
We 
may 
say 
that 
withoutinfantileamnesiatherewould 
benohystericalamnesia. 


I 
therefore 
believe 
that 
the 
infantile 
amnesia 
which 
causes 
the 
individual 
to 
look 
upon 
his 
childhood 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
prehistoric 
time 
and 
conceals 
from 



him 
the 
beginning 
of 
his 
own 
sexual 
life—that 
this 
amnesia 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
one 
does 
not 
usually 
attribute 
any 
value 
to 
the 
infantile 
period 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
sexual 
life.

ANALCHARACTER—In 
the 
course 
of 
studies 
of 
the 
pre-genital 
phases 
of 
the 
libido, 
we 
have 
gleaned 
some 
new 
pieces 
of 
information 
about 
the 
formation 
of 
character. 
We 
have 
been 
made 
aware 
of 
a 
triad 
of 
characteristics 
which 
are 
almost 
always 
to 
be 
found 
together: 
orderliness, 
parsimoniousness 
and 
obstinacy, 
and 
we 
have 
concluded 
from 
the 
analysis 
of 
persons 
possessing 
them 
that 
these 
characteristics 
proceed 
from 
the 
dissipation 
of 
their 
anal-erotism 
and 
its 
employment 
in 
other 
ways. 
Where 
this 
remarkable 
combinationis 
to 
befound, 
therefore, 
we 
speak 
of 
an 
‘anal 
character,’ 
and 
in 
a 
sense

anal-erotism.

ANALYSIS 
[cf. 
also 
PSYCHOANALYSIS]—When 
in 
analysis 
we 
render 
the 
ego 
assistance 
enabling 
it 
to 
undo 
its 
repressions, 
the 
ego 
regains 
its 
power 
over 
the 
repressed 
id 
and 
can 
so 
steer 
the 
course 
of 
the 
instinctual 
impulses 
as 
if 
the 
old 
danger 
situation 
no 
longer 
existed. 
What 
we 
achieve 
in 
this 
way 
is 
in 
complete 
harmony 
withwhat 
weaccomplishin 
other 
spheres 
of 
medical 
activity. 
As 
a 
rule 
our 
treatment 
has 
to 
be 
satisfied 
with 
bringing 
about 
more 
rapidly, 
more 
certainly 
and 
with 
less 
trouble 
the 
satisfactory 
outcome 
which 
under 
favorable

would 
have

The 
neurotic 
sets 
himself 
to 
the 
work 
because 
he 
believes 
in 
the 
analyst, 
and 
he 
believes 
in 
him 
because 
he 
begins 
to 
entertain 
certain 
feelings 
towards 
him. 
The 
attitude 
is, 
in 
fact—to 
put 
it 
bluntly—a 
kind 
of 
falling 
in 
love. 
The 
patient 
repeats, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
falling 
in 
love 
with 
the 
analyst, 
psychical 
experiences 
which 
he 
underwent 
before; 
he 
has 
transferred 
to 
the 
analyst 
psychical 
attitudes 
which 
lay 
ready 
within 
him, 
and 
which 
were 
intimately 
linked 
with 
the 
inception 
of 
his 
neurosis. 
He 
repeats, 
too, 
his 
onetime 
defense 
reactions 
before 
our 
eyes, 
and 
wants 
nothing 
so 
much 
as 
to 
repeat 
all 
the 
vicissitudes 
of 
that 
forgotten 
period 
in 
his 
relations 
with 
the 
analyst. 
So 
what 
he 
is 
showing 
us 
is 
the 
very 
core 
of 
his 
most 
private 
life; 
he 
is 
palpably 
reproducing 
it, 
as 
though 
it 
were 
all 
happening 
in 
the 
present, 
instead 
of 
remembering 
it. 
With 
this, 
the 
riddle 
of 
transference-love 
is 
solved, 
and 
with 
the 
very 
help 
of 
the 
new

the

can

a

The

from

In 
a 
little 
essay 
on 
Anxiety 
Neurosis, 
written 
in 
1895, 
I 
maintain 
that 
neurotic 
anxiety 
has 
its 
origin 
in 
the 
sexual 
life, 
and 
corresponds 
to 
a 
libido 
which 
has 
been 
deflected 
from 
its 
object 
and 
has 
found 
no 
employment. 
The 
accuracy 
of 
this 
formula 
has 
since 
then 
been 
demonstrated 
with 
ever-
increasing 
certainty. 
From 
it 
we 
may 
deduce 
the 
doctrine 
that 
anxiety-dreams 
are 
dreams 
of 
sexual 
content, 
and 
that 
the 
libido 
appertaining 
to 
this 
content 
hasbeentransformedinto

by

at

the

CASTRATION 
ANXIETY 
(FEAR, 
COMPLEX)—A 
male 
child 
commonly 
suffers 
from 
anxiety 
lest 
his 
father 
rob 
him 
of 
his 
male 
member; 
and 
so 
castration 
anxiety 
is 
one 
of 
the 
strongest 
influences 
on 
the 
development 
ofhischaracter,anddecisive 
for 
his 
sexualtendencies 
later. 


QLA—ch.

Before 
the 
child 
came 
under 
the 
domination 
of 
the 
castration 
complex, 
at 
the 
time 
when 
he 
still 
held 
the 
woman 
at 
her 
full 
value, 
he 
began 
to 
manifest 
an 
intensive 
desire 
to 
look, 
as 
an 
erotic 
activity 
of 
his 
impulse. 
He 
wished 
to 
see 
the 
genitals 
of 
other 
persons, 
originally 
probably 
because 
he 
wished 
to 
compare 
them 
with 
his 
own. 
The 
erotic 
attraction 
which 
emanated 
from 
the 
person 
of 
his 
mother 
soon 
reached 
its 
height 
in 
the 
longing 
to 
see 
her 
genital, 
which 
he 
believed 
to 
be 
a 
penis. 
With 
the 
cognition 
acquired 
only 
later 
that 
the 
woman 
has 
no 
penis, 
this 
longing 
often 
becomes 
transformed 
into 
its 
opposite 
and 
gives 
place 
to 
disgust, 
which 
in 
the 
years 
of 
puberty 
may 
become 
the 
cause 
of 
psychic 
impotence, 
of 
misogyny 
and 
of 
lasting 
homosexuality. 
But 
the 
fixation 
on 
the 
once 
so 
vividly 
desired 
object, 
the 
penis 
of 
the 
woman, 
leaves 
ineradicable 
traces 
in 
the 
psychic 
life 
of 
the 
child, 
which 
has 
gone 
through 
that 
fragment 
of 
infantile 
sexual 
investigation 
with 
particular 
thoroughness. 
The 
fetish-like 
reverence 
for 
the 
feminine 
foot 
and 
shoe 
seems 
to 
take 
the 
foot 
only 
as 
a 
substitutive 
symbol 
for 
the 
once 
revered 
and 
since 
then 
missed 
member 
of 
the 
woman. 
The 
“braid-snippers,” 
without 
knowing 
it, 
play 
the 
part 
of 
persons 
who 
perform 
the 
act 
of 
castration 
on 
the 
femalegenital.

in 
that

disdain 
the

of 
a 
conscious 
intention 
and 
really 
need 
no 
pretext. 
They 
appear 
independently 
and 
are 
accepted 
because 
one 
does 
not 
credit 
them 
with 
any 
aim 
or 
purpose. 
We 
execute 
them 
“without 
thinking 
anything 
of 
them,” 
“by

“just 
to

he

He 
finds 
this

the

too 
valuable

too 
important 
to 
believe 
that 
it 
would 
be 
missing 
in

whom 
he 
feels

Various

the

later

elaborations 
which 
might

been

forces. 
Thus, 
the 
“childhood 
reminiscences” 
of

altogether 
advance 
to 
the 
signification 
of 
“concealing

COMPULSION 
NEUROSIS—The 
symptoms 
of 
compulsion 
neurosis 
are, 
broadly 
speaking, 
of 
two 
kinds 
and 
of 
contradictory 
purport. 
Either 
they 
are 
prohibitions 
or 
prophylactic 
measures 
or 
atonements, 
and 
are 
thus 
of 
a 
negativecharacter, 
ortheyareontheotherhand 
substitutegratifications,very 
often 
symbolic 
in 
disguise. 
The 
situation 
of 
origin 
in 
the 
case 
of 
compulsion 
neurosis 
is 
in 
fact 
none 
other 
than 
that 
in 
hysteria, 
namely, 
the 
defense 
necessary 
against 
the 
libidinal 
demands 
of 
the 
oedipus 
complex. 
Furthermore 
there 
seems 
to 
be 
present 
in 
every 
compulsion 
neurosis 
a 
lowermost 
layer 
of 
hysterical 
symptoms 
of 
very 
early 
formation.

COMPULSIVE 
CEREMONIALS—Compulsive 
ceremonials 
have 
the 
intention 
to 
“undo” 
as 
their 
second 
root, 
their 
first 
being 
to 
prevent 
or 
to 
forestall 
some 
specific 
thing 
happening 
or 
being 
repeated. 
The 
distinction 
is 
easy 
enough 
to 
grasp; 
precautionary 
measures 
are 
of 
a 
rational 
character, 
“voiding” 
or 
“cancelling” 
by 
means 
of 
“undoing” 
of

CONFESSION

it

thing

it

In 
confession 
the 
sinner 
tells 
what 
he 
knows,

the

must 
tell 
more.

What 
is 
the 
kernel, 
what 
is 
the 
true

situation? 
Evidently 
it 
is 
the 
estimation 
of 
our 
strength 
in 
comparison 
with 
its 
magnitude, 
the 
admission 
of 
our 
helplessness 
in 
the 
face 
of 
it—of 
material 
helplessness 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
true 
danger, 
of 
psychic 
helplessness 
in 
that 
of 
instinctual 
danger. 
Our 
judgment 
in 
this 
regard 
will 
be 
guided 
by 
actual 



experience; 
whether 
one 
is 
mistaken 
in 
one’s 
evaluation 
makes 
no 
difference 
to 
the 
result. 
Let 
us 
call 
our 
experience 
in 
a 
situation 
of 
helplessness 
of 
this 
kind 
a 
traumatic 
situation; 
we 
then 
have 
a 
sufficient 
basis 
for 
distinguishing 
the 
traumatic 
from 
the 
danger 
situation. 
Now 
it 
is 
an 
important 
advance 
in 
self-protection 
when 
this 
traumatic 
situation 
of 
helplessness 
is 
not 
merely 
awaited 
but 
is 
foreseen, 
anticipated. 
Let

which 
resides 
the

of 
this

the

during 
the 
psychoanalytic 
treatment, 
which 
is 
especially 
interesting. 
The 
patient 
asserts 
with 
all 
subjective 
signs 
of 
certainty, 
that 
he 
previously 
related 
this 
definite 
episode. 
The 
physician, 
however, 
is 
sure 
of 
the 
contrary 
and, 
as 
a 
rule, 
can 
convince 
the 
patient 
of 
it. 
The 
explanation 
of 
this 
interesting 
phenomenon 
is 
undoubtedly 
based 
on 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
patient 
had 
the 
impulse 
and 
intention 
of 
imparting 
this 
memory, 
but 
failed 
to 
execute 
it, 
and 
that 
he 
now

that 
it

wrong 
to 
designate 
the

On

because

the

The 
anxiety 
in 
dreams 
may 
of 
course 
be 
of 
a 
psychoneurotic 
character, 
originating 
in 
psycho-sexual 
excitation, 
in 
which 
case, 
the 
anxiety 
corresponds 
to 
repressed 
libido. 
Then 
this 
anxiety, 
like 
the 
whole 
anxiety-
dream, 
has 
the 
significance 
of 
a 
neurotic 
symptom, 
and 
we 
stand 
at 
the 
dividing-line 
where 
the 
wish-fulfilling 
tendency 
of 
dreams 
is 
frustrated. 
But 
in 
other 
anxiety-dreams 
the 
feeling 
of 
anxiety 
comes 
from 
somatic 
sources 
(as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
persons 
suffering 
from 
pulmonary 
or 
cardiac 
trouble, 
with 
occasional 
difficulty 
in 
breathing), 
and 
then 
it 
is 
used 
to 
help 
such 
strongly 
suppressed 
wishes 
to 
attain 
fulfilment 
in 
a 
dream, 
the 
dreaming 
of 
which 
from 
psychic 
motives 
would 
have 
resulted 
in 
the 
same 
release 
of 
anxiety. 
It 
is 
not 
difficult 
to 
reconcile 
these 
two 
apparently 
contradictory 
cases. 
When 
two 
psychic 
formations, 
an 
affective 
inclination 
and 
a 
conceptual 
content, 
are 
intimately 
connected, 
either 
one 
being 
actually 
present 
will 
evoke 
the 
other, 
even 
in 
a 
dream; 
now 
the 
anxiety 
of 
somatic 
origin 
evokes 
the 
suppressed 
conceptual 
content, 
now 
it 
is 
the 
released 
conceptual 
content, 
accompanied 
by 
sexual 
excitement, 
which 
causes 
the 
release 
of 
anxiety. 
In 
the 
one 
case 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
a 
somatically 
determined 
affect 
is 
psychically 
interpreted; 
in 
the 
other 
case 
all 
is 
of 
psychic 
origin, 
but 
the 
content 
which 
has 
been 



suppressed 
is 
easily 
replaced 
by 
a 
somatic 
interpretation 
which 
fits 
the 
anxiety.

Dreams,Counter-Wish—In 
the 
sexual 
constitution 
of 
many 
persons 
there 
is 
a 
masochistic 
component, 
which 
has 
arisen 
through 
the 
conversion 
of 
the 
aggressive, 
sadistic 
component 
into 
its 
opposite. 
Such 
people 
are 
called 
“ideal” 
masochists 
if 
they 
seek 
pleasure 
not 
in 
the 
bodily 
pain 
which 
may 
be 
inflicted 
upon 
them, 
but 
in 
humiliation 
and 
psychic 
chastisement. 
It 
is 
obvious 
that 
such 
persons 
may 
have 
counter-wish-dreams 
and 
disagreeable 
dreams, 
yet 
these 
are 
for 
them 
nothing 
more 
than 
wish-fulfilments, 
which 
satisfytheir

Dreams, 
Composite 
Formation 
in—The 
possibility 
of 
creating 
composite 
formations 
is 
one 
of 
the 
chief 
causes 
of 
the 
fantastic 
character 
so 
common 
in 
dreams, 
in 
that 
it 
introduces 
into 
the 
dream-content 
elements 
which 
could 
never 
have 
been 
objects 
of 
perception. 
The 
psychic 
process 
which 
occurs 
in 
the 
creation 
of 
composite 
formations 
is 
obviously 
the 
same 
as 
that 
which 
we 
employ 
in 
conceiving 
or 
figuring 
a 
dragon 
or 
a 
centaur 
in 
our 
waking 
senses. 
The 
only 
difference 
is 
that 
in 
the 
fantastic 
creations 
of 
waking 
life 
the 
impression 
intended 
is 
itself 
the 
decisive 
factor, 
while 
the 
composite 
formation 
in 
the 
dream 
is 
determined 
by 
a 
factor—the 
common 
feature 
in 
the 
dream-thoughts—which 
is 
independent 
of 
its 
form.

Dreams, 
Childhood 
Experiences 
in—If 
we 
turn 
from 
the 
manifest 
dream-
content 
to 
the 
dream-thoughts 
which 
are 
revealed 
only 
on 
analysis, 
the 
experiences 
of 
childhood 
may 
be 
found 
to 
recur 
even 
in 
dreams 
whose 
content 
would 
not 
have 
led 
us 
to 
suspect 
anything 
of 
the 
sort. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
child 
with 
all 
his 
impulses 
survives 
in 
the 
dream. 
As 
a 
rule, 
of 
course, 
a 
scene 
from 



childhood 
is 
represented 
in 
the 
manifest 
dream-content 
only 
by 
an 
allusion, 
and 
must 
be 
disentangled 
from 
the 
dream 
by 
interpretation. 
The 
citation 
of 
examples 
of 
this 
kind 
cannot 
be 
very 
convincing, 
because 
any 
guarantee 
that 
they 
are 
really 
experiences 
of 
childhood 
is 
lacking; 
if 
they 
belong 
to 
an 
earlier 
period 
of 
life, 
they 
are 
no 
longer 
recognized 
by 
our 
memory. 
The 
conclusion 
that 
such 
childish 
experiences 
recur 
at 
all 
in 
dreams 
is 
justified 
in 
psychoanalytic 
work 
by 
a 
great 
number 
of 
factors, 
which 
in 
their 
combined 
results 
appear 
to 
be 
sufficiently 
reliable. 
But 
when, 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
dream-interpretation 
such 
references 
to 
childish 
experiences 
are 
torn 
out 
of

for

are,

they

context; 
but 
it 
is 
by 
no

immaterial 
whether 
these 
dreams 
appear 
to 
the

as 
a 
continuum, 
or 
whether 
they 
are 
organized 
in 
several 
pieces, 
and 
if 
so 
in 
how 
many. 
The 
number 
of 
pieces 
often

to 
the

number 
of 
distinct 
nodal 
points 
in 
the 
chain

which 
make 
up 
the

forces

nucleus

an

by 
one’s 
own 
person 
which 
is 
seen 
not 
as 
that 
of 
a 
child,

as 
it 
exists 
in 
the 
present, 
and 
by 
the 
idea 
of 
scanty 
clothing 
which 
emerges 
indistinctly, 
owing 
to 
the 
superimposition 
of 
so 
many 
later 
situations 
of 
being 
partially 
clothed, 
or 
out

consideration

the

to 
these 
elements 
are 
added 
the 
persons 
in 
whose 
presence 
one 
is 
ashamed. 
Strangely 
enough, 
those 
persons 
who 
are 
the 
objects 
of 
our 
sexual 
interest 
in 
childhood 
are 
omitted 
from 
all 
reproductions 
in

in

or 
in 
obsessional 
neurosis; 
paranoia 
alone 
restores 
the 
spectators, 
and 
is 
fanatically 
convinced 
of 
their 
presence, 
although 
they 
remain 
unseen. 
Furthermore, 
repression 
finds 
a 
place 
in 
the 
exhibition-dream. 
For 
the 
disagreeable 
sensation 
of 
the

is, 
of 
course, 
the 
reaction 
on

part 
of

inevitable; 
we 
have 
seen 
that 
more 
than 
one 
kind 
of 
behaviour 
toward 
the 
physical 
stimuli 
received 
during 
sleep 
is 
possible. 
Where 
this 
combination 
is 
effected, 
a 
conceptual 
material 
for 
the 
dream-content 
has 
been 
found 
which 
will 
represent 
both 
kinds 
of 
dream-sources,thesomaticaswellasthe

The 
nature 
of 
the 
dream 
is 
not 
altered 
when 
somatic 
material 
is 
added 
to 
the 
psychic 
dream-sources; 
it 
still 
remains 
a 
wish-fulfilment,

able 
to

the 
significance 
of 
external

for 
the

I 
imagine 
that 
a 
co-operation 
of 
individual, 
physiological 
and 
accidental 
factors, 
which 
depend 
on 
the 
circumstances 
of 
the 
moment, 
determines 
how 
one 
will 
behave 
in 
individual 
cases 
of 
more 
intensive 
objective 
stimulation 
during 
sleep; 
habitual 
or 
accidental 
profundity 
of 
sleep, 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
intensity 
of 
the 
stimulus, 
will 
in 
one 
case 
make 
it 
possible 
so 
to 
suppress 
the 
stimulus 
that 
it 
will 
not 
disturb 
the 
sleeper, 
while 
in 
another 
case 
it 
will 
force 
the 
sleeper 
to 
wake, 
or 
will 
assist 
the 
attempt 
to 
subdue 
the 
stimulus 
by 
weaving 
it 
into 
the 
texture 
of 
the 
dream. 
In 
accordance 
with 
the 
multiplicity 
of 
these

external 
objective 
stimuli 
will 
be

Dreams 
of 
Falling—Dreams 
of 
falling 
are 
more 
frequently 
characterized 
by 
anxiety. 
Their 
interpretation, 
when 
they 
occur 
in 
women, 
offers 
no 
difficulty, 
because 
they 
nearly 
always 
accept 
the 
symbolic 
meaning 
of 
falling, 
which 
is 
a 
circumlocution 
for 
giving 
way 
to 
an 
erotic 
temptation. 
We 
have 
not 
yet 
exhausted 
the 
infantile 
sources 
of 
the 
dream 
of 
falling; 
nearly 
all 
children 
have 
fallen 
occasionally, 
and 
then 
been 
picked 
up 
and 
fondled; 
if 
they

I 
have 
good 
reasons 
for 
rejecting 
the 
explanation 
that 
it 
is 
the 
state 
of 
our 
dermal 
sensations 
during 
sleep, 
the 
sensation 
of 
the 
movements 
of 
the 
lungs, 



etc., 
that 
evokes 
dreams 
of 
flying 
and 
falling. 
I 
see 
that 
these 
very 
sensations 
have 
been 
reproduced 
from 
the 
memory 
to 
which 
the 
dream 
refers—and 
that 
theyare,therefore,dream-content 
andnotdream-sources.

Fire—The

justifies

which 
forbids 
children 
to 
“play 
with 
fire” 
so 
that 
they 
may 
not 
wet 
the 
bed 
at 
night. 
These 
dreams 
also 
are 
based 
on 
reminiscences 
of 
the

of 
childhood.

the

history 
of 
the

Dreams 
of 
Flying—Why 
do 
so 
many 
people 
dream 
of 
flying? 
Psychoanalysis 
answers 
this 
question 
by 
stating 
that 
to 
fly 
or 
to 
be 
a 
bird 
in 
the 
dream 
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
concealment 
of 
another 
wish 
to 
the 
recognition 
of 
which 
we 
are 
led 
by 
more 
than 
one 
linguistic 
or 
real 
bridge. 
When 
the 
inquisitive 
child 
is 
told 
that 
a 
big 
bird 
like 
the 
stork 
brings 
the 
little 
children, 
when 
the 
ancients 
have 
formed 
the 
phallus 
winged 
. 
. 
. 
all 
these 
facts 
are 
only 
small 
fragments 
from 
a 
large 
collection 
which 
teaches 
us 
that 
the 
wish 
to 
be 
able 
to 
fly 
signifies 
in 
the 
dream 
nothing 
but 
the 
longing 
for 
the 
ability 
of 
sexual 
accomplishment. 
This 
is 
an 
early 
infantile 
wish. 
When 
the 
grown-up 
recallshischildhood, 
itappearstohimasajoyfultime,in 
whichoneis 
happy 
for 
the 
moment 
and 
looks 
to 
the 
future 
without 
any 
wishes; 
it 
is 
for 
this 
reason 
that 
he 
envies 
children. 
But 
the 
children 
themselves, 
if 
they 
could 
inform 
us 
about 
it, 
would 
probably 
give 
us 
different 
reports. 
It 
seems 
that 
childhood 
is 
not 
that 
blissful 
idyl 
into 
which 
we 
later 
distort 
it, 
that 
on 
the 
contrary 
children 
are 
lashed 
through 
the 
years 
of 
childhood 
by 
the 
wish 
to 
become 
big, 
and 
to 
imitate 
the 
grown-ups. 
This 
wish 
instigates 
all 
their 
playing. 
If 
in 
the 
course 
of 
their 
sexual 
investigation 
children 
feel 
that 
the 
grown-up 
knows 
something 
wonderful 
concerning 
the 
mysterious 
and 
yet 
so 
important 
realm 
that 
they 
are 
prohibited 
from 
knowing 
or 
doing, 
they 
are 
seized 
with 
a 
violent 
wish 
to 
know 
it, 
and 
dream 
of 
it 
in 
the 
form 
of 
flying, 
or 
prepare 
this 
disguise 
of 
the 
wish 
for 
their 
later 
flying 
dreams.

Dream, 
Function 
of—Under 
certain 
conditions 
the 
dream 
can 
only 
achieve 
its 
end 
in 
a 
very 
incomplete 
way, 
or 
has 
to 
abandon 
it 
entirely; 
an 
unconscious 
fixation 
to 
the 
trauma 
seems 
to 
head 
the 
list 
of 
these 
obstacles 
to 
the 
dream-function. 
The 
sleeper 
has 
to 
dream, 
because 
the 
nightly 
relaxation 
of 
repression 
allows 
the 
upward 
thrust 
of 
the 
traumatic 
fixation 
to 
become 
active; 
but 
sometimes 
his 
dream-work, 
which 
endeavours 
to 
change 
the 
memory 
traces 
of 
the 
traumatic 
event 
into 
a 
wish-fulfilment, 
fails 
to 
operate. 
In 
these 
circumstances 
the 
result 
is 
that 
one 
becomes 
sleepless; 
one 
gives 
up 
all 
idea 
of 
sleep 
because 
of 
one’s 
fear 
of 
the 
failure 
of 
the 
dream-function. 
The 
traumatic 
neurosis 
is 
an 
extreme 
case, 
but 
one 
must 
also 
attribute 
a 
traumatic 
character 
to 
infantile 
experiences 
as 
well; 
so 
one 
need 
not 
be 
surprised 
if 
lesser 
disturbances 
of 
the 
function 
of 
the 
dream 
occur 
in

Dreams, 
Prophetic—The

the 
fact

were

foretold 
by 
the

Dream 
as

Psychosis—A

then, 
is 
a 
psychosis, 
with 
all 
the 
absurdities, 
delusions 
and 
illusions 
of 
a 
psychosis. 
No

it 
is 
a 
psychosis 
which 
has 
only 
a 
short 
duration, 
which 
is

Punishment—Even

those 
of

If 
we

a 
pure

to 
reinstate

Dreams, 
Secondary 
Elaboration

is 
to 
be 
considered 
a 
more

that 
makes 
its

come 
into

as 
an 
object

When 
the

we 
treat 
it 
in

we

Dream 
and 
Its 
Relationship 
to 
Sleep—Throughout 
the 
whole 
of

we 
are 
just

as

wish-fulfillment. 
The

This

Dreams, 
Influence 
of 
Somatic 
Stimuli 
on—The 
general 
aggregate 
of 
bodily 
sensation 
must 
undoubtedly 
be 
included 
among 
the 
dominant 
dream-stimuli 
of 
internal 
bodily 
origin. 
Not 
that 
it 
is 
capable 
of 
supplying 
the 
dream-
content; 
but 
it 
forces 
the 
dream-thoughts 
to 
make 
a 
choice 
from 
the 
material 
destined 
to 
serve 
the 
purpose 
of 
representation 
in 
the 
dream-content, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
brings 
within 
easy 
reach 
that 
part 
of 
the 
material 
which 
is 
adapted 
to 
its 
own 
character, 
and 
holds 
the 
rest 
at 
a 
distance. 
Moreover, 
this 
general 
feeling, 
which 
survives 
from 
the 
preceding 
day, 
is 
of 
course 
connected 
with 
the 
psychic 
residues 
that 
are 
significant 
for 
the 
dream. 
Moreover, 
this 
feeling 
itself 
may 
be 
either 
maintained 
or 
overcome 
in 
the 
dream, 
sothat 
itmay,ifitis 
painful,veerroundinto 
itsopposite.

If 
the 
external 
nerve-stimuli 
and 
the 
inner 
bodily 
stimuli 
are 
sufficiently 
intense 
to 
compel 
psychic 
attention, 
they 
represent—that 
is, 
if 
they 
result 
in 
dreaming 
at 
all, 
and 
not 
in 
waking—a 
fixed 
point 
for 
dream-formation, 
a 
nucleus 
in 
the 
dream-material, 
for 
which 
an 
appropriate 
wish-fulfilment 
is 
sought, 
just 
as 
well 
as 
mediating 
ideas 
between 
two 
psychical 
dream-stimuli 
are 
sought. 
To 
this 
extent 
it 
is 
true 
of 
a 
number 
of 
dreams 
that 
the 
somatic 
element 
dictates 
the 
dream-content. 
In 
this 
extreme 
case 
even 
a 
wish 
that 
is 



not 
actually 
present 
may 
be 
aroused 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
dream-formation. 
But 
the 
dream 
cannot 
do 
otherwise 
than 
represent 
a 
wish 
in 
some 
situation 
as 
fulfilled; 
it 
is, 
as 
it 
were, 
confronted 
with 
the 
task 
of 
discovering 
what 
wish 
can 
be 
represented 
as 
fulfilled 
by 
the 
given 
sensation. 
Even 
if 
this 
given 
material 
is 
of 
a 
painful 
or 
disagreeable 
character, 
yet 
it 
is 
not 
unserviceable 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
dream-formation. 
The 
psychic 
life 
has 
at 
its 
disposal 
even 
wisheswhosefulfilmentevokesdispleasure, 
whichseemsa 
contradiction,but 
becomes 
perfectly 
intelligible 
if 
we 
take 
into 
account 
the 
presence 
of 
two 
sorts 
of 
psychic 
instance 
and 
the 
censorship 
that 
subsists 
between 
them. 
If 
sensations 
of 
a 
disagreeable 
character 
which 
originate 
from 
somatic 
sources 
are 
present 
during 
sleep, 
this 
constellation 
is 
utilized 
by 
the 
dream-activity 
to 
procure 
the 
fulfilment—with 
more 
or 
less 
maintenance 
of

Dreams, 
Speech 
in—When 
a 
spoken 
utterance, 
expressly 
distinguished 
as 
such 
fromathought, 
occurs 
in 
a 
dream, 
itis 
an 
invariable 
rule 
that 
the 
dream-
speech 
has 
originated 
from 
a 
remembered 
speech 
in 
the 
dream-material. 
The 
wording 
of 
the 
speech 
has 
either 
been 
preserved 
in 
its 
entirety 
or 
has 
been 
slightly 
altered 
in 
expression; 
frequently 
the 
dream-speech 
is 
pieced 
together 
from 
different 
recollections 
of 
spoken 
remarks; 
the 
wording 
has 
remained 
the 
same, 
but 
the 
sense 
has 
perhaps 
become 
ambiguous, 
or 
differs 
from 
the 
wording. 
Not 
infrequently 
the 
dream-speech 
serves 
merely 
as 
an

Perhaps 
this 
collection 
will 
suffice 
to 
prove 
that 
frequently, 
and 
under 
the 
most 
complex 
conditions, 
dreams 
may 
be 
noted 
which 
can 
be 
understood 
only 
as 
wish-fulfilments, 
and 
which 
present 
their 
content 
without 
concealment. 
In 
most 
cases 
these 
are 
short 
and 
simple 
dreams, 
and 
they 
stand 
in 
pleasant 
contrast 
to 
the 
confused 
and 
overloaded 
dream-compositions 
which 
have 
almost 
exclusively 
attracted 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
writers 
on 
the

it 
will 
repay 
us 
if 
we 
give 
some 
time 
to 
the

of 
these 
simple 
dreams. 
The 
simplest 
dreams 
of 
all 
are, 
I 
suppose, 
to 
be 
expected 
in 
the 
case 
of

less 
complicated

DREAM-CENSOR—The 
conflict 
of 
two 
psychic 
factors, 
which 
we— 
roughly—call 
the 
repressed 
unconscious 
and 
the 
conscious, 
dominates 
our 
lives, 
and 
the 
resistance 
against 
the 
interpretation 
of 
dreams, 
the 
hall-mark 
of 
the 
dream-censorship, 
is 
none 
other 
than 
the 
repression-resistance 
which 
keepsthesetwofactors 
apart. 


NILP—ch.

The 
fact 
of 
dream-censorship 
shows 
that 
enough 
repressive 
resistance 
remains 
operativeevenduring

NILP—ch.

The 
resistance 
which 
we 
come 
across 
during 
the 
process 
of 
dream-
interpretation 
must 
play 
some 
part 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
dream 
as 
well. 
. 
. 
. 
Resistance 
is 
the 
sure 
sign 
of 
a 
conflict. 
There 
must 
be 
a 
force 
present 
which 
is 
trying 
to 
express 
something, 
and 
another 
which 
is 
striving 
to 
prevent 
its 
expression. 
What 
comes 
into 
being 
as 
the 
manifest 
dream 
may, 
therefore, 
be 
regarded 
as 
comprising 
all 
the 
solutions 
to 
which 
the 
battle 
between 
these 
two 
opposing 
forces 
can 
be 
reduced. 
At 
one 
point 
one 
of 
the 
forces 
may 
havebeen 
able 
toget 
throughwhat 
it 
wantedto 
say, 
atanother 
the 
counteracting 
force 
may 
have 
succeeded 
in 
abolishing 
the 
intended 
communication 
entirely, 
or 
may 
have 
substituted 
for 
it 
something 
which 
betrays 
no 
sign 
of 
it. 
The 
most 
usual 
cases, 
and 
those 
which 
are 
the 
most 
characteristic 
of 
the 
process 
of 
dream-formation, 
are 
those 
in 
which 
the 
conflict 
results 
in 
a 
compromise, 
so 
that 
the 
communicating 
force 
can 
indeed 
say 
what 
it 
wants 
to 
say, 
but 
not 
in 
the 
way 
it 
wants 
to 
say 
it; 
it 
is 
toned 
down, 
distorted 
and 
made 
unrecognizable. 
If 
therefore 
the 
dream 
does 
not 
faithfully 
represent 
the 
dream-thoughts, 
if 
a 
process 
of 
interpretation 
is 
necessary 
to 
bridge 
the 
gulf 
between 
the 
two, 
this 
is 
the 
result 
of 
the 
counteracting, 
inhibiting 
and 
restraining 
force 
whose 
existence 
we 
have 
inferred 
from 
perceiving 
the 
resistance 
in 
dream-interpretation. 
So 
long 
as 
we 
regarded 
the 
dream 
as 
an 
isolated 
phenomenon, 
independent 
of 
other 
psychological 
formations 
which 
are 
allied 
to 
it, 
we 
called 
this 
force 
the 
dream-censor. 


NILP—ch.

DREAM-CONDENSATION—The 
laws 
governing 
unconscious 
processes, 
which 
come 
to 
light 
in 
this 
manner, 
are 
remarkable 
enough 
and 
suffice 
to 



explain 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
what 
seems 
strange 
to 
us 
about 
dreams. 
Above 
all 
there 
is 
a 
striking 
tendency 
to 
condensation, 
an 
inclination 
to 
form 
fresh 
unities 
out 
of 
elements 
which 
in 
our 
waking 
thoughts 
we 
should 
certainly 
have 
kept 
separate. 
As 
a 
consequence 
of 
this, 
a 
single 
element 
of 
the 
manifest 
dream 
often 
stands 
for 
a 
whole 
number 
of 
latent 
dream-thoughts, 
as 
though 
it 
were 
a 
combined 
allusion 
to 
all 
of 
them; 
and 
in 
general 
the 
dimensions 
of 
a 
manifest 
dream 
are 
extraordinarily 
small 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
wealth 
of 
materialfrom 
whichithas 
sprung. 


OoPA—ch.

On 
other 
occasions 
and 
even 
much 
more 
frequently, 
the 
condensation 
work 
of 
the 
dream 
produces 
no 
compositions, 
but 
pictures 
which 
closely 
resemble 
an 
object 
or 
person 
up 
to 
a 
certain 
addition 
or 
variation 
which 
comesfrom 
another 
source.

DREAM-CONTENT—The 
peculiar 
mode 
of 
operation, 
whose 
most 
striking 
function 
we 
recognize 
in 
the 
dream 
content, 
should 
not 
be 
attributed 
only 
to 
the 
sleeping 
state 
of 
the 
psychic 
life, 
when 
we 
possess 
abundant 
proof 
of 
its 
activity 
during 
the 
waking 
state 
in 
faulty 
actions. 
The 
same 
connection 
also 
forbids 
us 
from 
assuming 
that 
these 
psychic 
processes 
which 
impress 
us 
as 
abnormal 
and 
strange, 
are 
determined 
by 
deep-seated 
decay 
of 
psychic 
activityorbymorbid 
stateoffunction. 


PEL—ch.

For 
us 
a 
new 
psychic 
material 
interposes 
itself 
between 
the 
dream-content 
and 
the 
results 
of 
our 
investigations: 
the 
latent 
dream-content, 
or 
dream-
thoughts, 
which 
are 
obtained 
only 
by 
our 
method. 
We 
develop 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
dream 
from 
this 
latent 
content, 
and 
not 
from 
the 
manifest 
dream-content. 
The 
dream-content 
appears 
to 
us 
as 
a 
translation 
of 
the 
dream-thoughts 
into 
another 
mode 
of 
expression, 
whose 
symbols

DREAM-DISPLACEMENT—It 
becomes 
very 
probable 
that 
a 
psychic 
force 
expresses 
itself 
in 
the 
dream-work 
which, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
strips 
the 
elements 
of 
the 
high 
psychic 
value 
of 
their 
intensity 
and, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
by 
means 
of 
overdetermination, 
creates 
new 
significant 
values 
from 
elements 
of 
slight 
value, 
which 
new 
values 
then 
make 
their 
way 
into 
the 
dream-
content. 
Now 
if 
this 
is 
the 
method 
of 
procedure, 
there 
has 
occurred 
in 
the 
process 
of 
dream-formation 
a 
transference 
and 
displacement 
of 
the 
psychic 
intensities 
of 
the 
individual 
elements, 
from 
which 
results 
the 
textual 
difference 
between 
the 
dream-content 
and 
the 
thought-content. 
The 
process 
which 
we 
here 
assume 
to 
be 
operative 
is 
actually 
the 
most 
essential 
part 
of 
the 
dream-work; 
it 
may 
fitly 
be 
called 
dream-displacement. 
Dream-
displacement 
and 
dream-condensation 
are 
the 
two 
craftsmen 
to 
whom 
we 
maychiefly 
ascribe 
thestructureofthedream. 


I 
think 
it 
will 
be 
easy 
to 
recognize 
the 
psychic 
force 
which 
expresses 
itself 
in 
dream-displacement. 
The 
result 
of 
this 
displacement 
is 
that 
the 
dream-
content 
no 
longer 
has 
any 
likeness 
to 
the 
nucleus 
of 
the 
dream-thoughts, 
and 
the 
dream 
reproduces 
only 
a 
distorted 
form 
of 
the 
dream-wish 
in 
the 
unconscious. 
But 
we 
are 
already 
acquainted 
with 
dream-distortion; 
we 
have 
traced 
it 
back 
to 
the 
censorship 
which 
one 
psychic 
instance 
in 
the 
psychic 
life 
exercises 
over 
another. 
Dream-displacement 
is 
one 
of 
the 
chief 
means 
of 
achieving 
this 
distortion. 
Is 
fecit, 
cui 
profuit. 
We 
must 
assume 
that 
dream-
displacement 
is 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
influence 
of 
this 
censorship, 
the 
endopsychicdefence. 


IoD—ch.

Displacement 
usually 
occurs 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
a 
colourless 
and 
abstract 
expression 
of 
the 
dream-thought 
is 
exchanged 
for 
one 
that 
is 
pictorial 
and 
concrete.

DREAM-DISTORTION—The 
dream-content 
takes 
up 
remnants 
of 
trivial 
experiences 
as 
a 
manifestation 
of 
dream-distortion 
(by 
displacement), 
and 
we 
have 
recognized 
this 
dream-distortion 
as 
the 
work 
of 
a 
censorship 
operating 
between 
thetwopsychicinstances. 


IoD—ch. 
5 


The 
study 
of 
dream-work 
affords 
us 
an 
excellent 
example 
of 
the 
way 
in 
which 
unconscious 
material 
from 
the 
id—originally 
unconscious 
and 



repressed 
unconscious 
alike—forces 
itself 
upon 
the 
ego, 
becomes 
preconscious 
and, 
owing 
to 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
ego, 
undergoes 
the 
modifications 
which 
we 
call 
dream-distortion. 
There 
are 
no 
features 
of 
the 
dreamwhichcannotbe 
explained 
inthisfashion. 


OoPA—ch.

I 
regard 
the 
attribution 
of 
dream-distortion 
to 
the 
censorship 
as 
the 
central 
pointofmyconceptionofthedream. 
IoD—ch.

There 
are, 
of 
course, 
dreams 
which 
are 
undisguised 
wish-fulfilments. 
Wherever 
a 
wish-fulfilment 
is 
unrecognizable 
and 
disguised 
there 
must 
be 
present 
a 
tendency 
to 
defend 
oneself 
against 
this 
wish, 
and 
in 
consequence 
of 
this 
defencethewish 
isunable

The 
detailed 
correspondence 
between 
the 
phenomena 
of 
censorship 
and 
the 
phenomena 
of 
dream-distortion 
justifies 
us 
in 
presupposing 
similar 
conditions 
for 
both. 
We 
should 
then 
assume 
that 
in 
every 
human 
being 
there 
exist, 
as 
the 
primary 
cause 
of 
dream-formation, 
two 
psychic 
forces 
(tendencies 
or 
systems), 
one 
of 
which 
forms 
the 
wish 
expressed 
by 
the 
dream, 
while 
the 
other 
exercises 
a 
censorship 
over 
this 
dream-wish, 
thereby

Dream-Distortion 
as 
Prevention 
of 
Anxiety—An 
anxiety-dream 
occurs 
only 
when 
the

is 
entirely 
or 
partially 
overpowered, 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
overpowering 
of 
the 
censorship 
is 
facilitated 
when 
the 
actual 
sensation 
of 
anxiety 
is 
already 
present 
from 
somatic 
sources. 
It 
thus 
becomes 
obvious 
for 
what 
purpose 
the 
censorship 
performs 
its 
office 
and 
practises 
dream-distortion; 
it 
does 
so 
in

Roughly 
speaking, 
one 
can 
distinguish 
three 
general 
stages 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
dream: 
first, 
the 
transference 
of 
the 
conscious 
day 
remnants 
into 
the 
unconscious, 
a 
transference 
in 
which 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
sleeping 
state 
must 
co-operate; 
secondly, 
the 
actual 
dream-work 
in 
the 
unconscious; 



and 
thirdly, 
the 
regression 
of 
the 
elaborated 
dream 
material 
to 
the 
region 
of 
perception,wherebythedreambecomesconscious. 


The 
forces 
participating 
in 
the 
dream-formation 
may 
be 
recognized 
as 
the 
following: 
the 
wish 
to 
sleep; 
the 
sum 
of 
cathexis 
which 
still 
clings 
to 
the 
day 
remnants 
after 
the 
depression 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
state 
of 
sleep; 
the 
psychic 
energy 
of 
the 
unconscious 
wish 
forming 
the 
dream; 
and 
the 
opposing 
force 
of 
the 
“censorship,” 
which 
exercises 
its 
authority 
in 
our 
waking 
state, 
and 
is 
not 
entirely 
abolished 
during 
sleep. 
The 
task 
of 
dream-formation 
is, 
above 
all, 
to 
overcome 
the 
inhibition 
of 
the 
censorship, 
and 
it 
is 
just 
this 
task 
that 
is 
fulfilled 
by 
the 
displacement 
of 
the 
psychic 
energy 
within 
the 
material 
of 
the 
dream-thoughts.

Let 
me 
repeat 
the 
stages 
of 
dream-formation. 
The 
introduction: 
the 
wish 
to 
sleep, 
the 
voluntary 
withdrawal 
from 
the 
outside 
world. 
Two 
things 
follow 
from 
this: 
firstly, 
the 
possibility 
for 
older 
and 
more 
primitive 
modes 
of 
activity 
to 
manifest 
themselves, 
i.e. 
regression; 
and 
secondly, 
the 
decrease 
of 
the 
repression-resistance 
which 
weighs 
on 
the 
unconscious. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
this 
latter 
feature 
an 
opportunity 
for 
dream-formation 
presents 
itself, 
which 
is 
seized 
upon 
by 
the 
factors 
which 
are 
the 
occasion 
of 
the 
dream; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
internal 
and 
external 
stimuli 
which 
are 
in 
activity. 
The 
dream 
which 
thus 
eventuates 
is 
already 
a 
compromise-formation; 
it 
has 
a 
double 
function: 
it 
is 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
ego 
(‘ego-syntonic’), 
since 
it 
subserves 
the 
wish 
to 
sleepby 
drainingoff 
the 
stimuli 
which 
would 
otherwise 
disturb 
it, 
while 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
it 
allows 
to 
a 
repressed 
impulse 
the 
satisfaction 
which 
is 
possible 
in 
these 
circumstances 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
hallucinatory 
wish-fulfilment. 
The 
whole 
process 
of 
dream-formation, 
which 
is 
permitted 
by 
the 
sleeping 
ego, 
is, 
however, 
under 
the 
control 
of 
the 
censorship, 
a 
control 
which 
is 
exercised 
by 
what 
is 
left 
of 
the 
forces 
of 
repression. 
I 
cannot 
explain 
the 
process 
more 
simply; 
it 
is 
not 
in 
itself 
simpler 
thanthat.

Share 
of

evidence 
of 
the 
share 
taken 
by 
the 
unconscious 
id 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
dreams 
is 
abundant 
and 
convincin. 
(a) 
Memory 
is 
far 
more 
comprehensive 
in 
dreams 
than 
in 
waking 
life. 
Dreams 
bring 
up 
recollections 
which 
the 
dreamer 
has 
forgotten, 
which 
are 



inaccessible 
to 
him 
when 
he 
is 
awake. 
(b) 
Dreams 
make 
an 
unlimited 
use 
of 
linguistic 
symbols, 
the 
meaning 
of 
which 
is 
for 
the 
most 
part 
unknown 
to 
the 
dreamer. 
Our 
experience, 
however, 
enables 
us 
to 
establish 
their 
sense. 
They 
probably 
originate 
from 
earlier 
phases 
in 
the 
development 
of 
speech. 
(c) 
Memory 
very 
often 
reproduces 
in 
dreams 
impressions 
from 
the 
dreamer’s 
early 
childhood 
of 
which 
we 
can 
definitely 
assert 
not 
only 
that 
they 
had 
been 
forgotten 
but 
that 
they 
had 
become 
unconscious 
owing 
to 
repression. 
This 
is 
theexplanationofthehelp—usually 
indispensable—affordedto

when, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
analytic 
treatment 
of

we 
attempt 
to 
reconstruct 
the 
early 
life 
of 
the 
dreamer.

Beyond 
this, 
dreams 
bring 
to 
lightmaterialwhichcouldnotoriginateeitherfromthedreamer’sadultlife 
or 
from 
his 
forgotten 
childhood. 
We 
are 
obliged 
to 
regard 
it 
as 
part 
of 
the 
archaic 
heritage 
which 
a 
child 
brings

him

DREAM-INTERPRETATION—There

a

technique

it 
possible 
to 
interpret 
dreams, 
and 
on 
the 
application 
of 
this 
technique, 
every 
dream 
will 
reveal 
itself 
as 
a 
psychological 
structure, 
full 
of 
significance, 
and 
one 
which

The 
dream 
often 
appears 
to 
have 
several 
meanings; 
not 
only 
may 
several 
wish-fulfilments 
be 
combined 
in 
it, 
as 
our 
examples 
show, 
but 
one 
meaning 
or 
one 
wish-fulfilment 
may 
conceal 
another, 
until 
in 
the 
lowest 
stratum 
one 
comes 
upon 
the 
fulfilment 
of 
a 
wish 
from 
the 
earliest 
period 
of 
childhood; 
and 
here 
again 
it 
may 
be 
questioned 
whether 
the 
word 
“often” 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
this 
sentence 
may 
not 
more 
correctly 
be 
replaced 
by 
“constantly.”

We 
have 
got 
to 
turn 
the 
manifest 
dream 
into 
the 
latent 
dream, 
and 
we 
have 
to 
show 
how 
the 
latter 
became 
the 
former 
in 
the 
mental 
life 
of 
the 
dreamer. 
The 
first 
bit 
is 
a 
practical 
problem, 
it 
comes 
under 
the 
heading 
of 
dream-
interpretation, 
and 
requires 
a 
technique; 
the 
second 
is 
a 
theoretical 
problem, 



its 
solution 
should 
be 
the 
explanation 
of 
the 
hypothetical 
dream-work,

Dream-Interpretation, 
Resistance

may 
vary 
from 
an 
imperceptible 
amount 
to 
an 
amount 
so 
great 
that 
we 
cannot 
overcome 
it—at 
any 
rate 
with 
the 
means 
which 
are 
at 
present 
at 
our 
disposal. 
We 
are 
right 
in 
supposing 
that 
the 
longer

the 
more 
circuitous 
the

the

is 
the

Dreams, 
Semantics 
in—We 
cannot 
dismiss 
the 
conjecture, 
which

that 
we 
should 
understand 
the 
language 
of 
dreams 
better 
and 
translate 
it 
more 
easily 
if 
we 
knew 
more 
about 
the 
development 
of 
language. 


ASPW 



Dream-Interpretation, 
Technique 
of—We 
ask 
the 
dreamer 
as 
well 
to 
free 
himself 
from 
the 
impression 
of 
the 
manifest 
dream, 
to 
switch 
his 
attention 
from 
the 
dream 
as 
a 
whole 
to 
individual 
parts 
of 
its 
content, 
and 
to 
tell 
us 
one 
after 
another 
the 
things 
that 
occur 
to 
him 
in 
connection 
with 
these 
parts, 
what 
associations 
come 
into 
his 
mind 
when 
he 
turns 
his 
mental 
eye 
on 
to 
each 
of 
them 
separately. 
In 
what 
order 
shall 
we 
get 
the 
patient 
to 
take 
the 
parts 
of 
his 
dream? 
Here 
we 
have 
a 
variety 
of 
courses 
open 
to 
us. 
We 
can 
simply 
follow 
the 
chronological 
order 
in 
which 
the 
dream 
has 
been 
presented 
to 
us 
in 
description. 
That 
is 
what 
one 
might 
call 
the 
strictest, 
the 
classical 
method. 
Or 
we 
can 
ask 
the 
dreamer 
to 
look 
for 
the 
residue 
of 
the 
previous 
day 
in 
his 
dream, 
because 
experience 
has 
taught 
us 
that 
in 
almost 
every 
dream 
is 
incorporated 
a 
memory 
trace 
of, 
or 
an 
allusion 
to, 
an 
event 
(or 
it 
may 
be 
several 
events) 
of 
the 
previous 
day 
[the 
“dream 
day”]; 
and 
if 
we 
follow 
up 
these 
links 
we 
often 
discover 
all 
of 
a 
sudden 
the 
bridge 
from 
the 
apparently 
remote 
dream-worldtothe 
reallife 
ofthe 
patient. 
Or 
else 
wetellhimtobegin 
with 
those 
elements 
in 
the 
dream-content 
which 
have 
struck 
him 
on 
account 
of 
their 
clarity 
and 
sensuous 
force. 
We 
happen 
to 
know 
that 
it 
is 
particularly 



easy 
for 
him 
to 
obtain 
associations 
to 
such 
elements. 
It 
makes 
no 
difference 
by 
which 
of 
these 
ways 
we 
choose 
to 
reach 
the 
associations 
we 
are 
looking 
for. 
But 
let 
us 
have 
no 
misunderstanding. 
The 
associations 
to 
the 
dream 
are 
not 
the 
latent 
dream-thoughts. 
These 
are 
contained, 
but 
not 
completely 
contained,in 
the

The 
function 
of 
the 
dream-work 
may 
be 
described 
in 
the 
following 
manner: 
A 
structure 
of 
thoughts, 
mostly 
very 
complicated, 
which 
has 
been 
built 
up 
during 
the 
dayand 
not 
brought 
to 
settlement—aday 
remnant—clings 
firmly 
even 
during 
night 
to 
the 
energy 
which 
it 
had 
assumed—the 
underlying 
center 
of 
interest—and 
thus 
threatens 
to 
disturb 
sleep. 
This 
day 
remnant 
is 
transformed 
into 
a 
dream 
by 
the 
dream-work 
and 
in 
this 
way 
rendered 
harmless 
to 
sleep. 
But 
in 
order 
to 
make 
possible 
its 
employment 
by 
the 



dream-work, 
this 
day 
remnant 
must 
be 
capable 
of 
being 
cast 
into 
the 
form 
of 
a 
wish, 
a 
condition 
that 
is 
not 
difficult 
to 
fulfill. 
The 
wish 
emanating 
from 
the 
dream-thoughts 
forms 
the 
first 
step 
and 
later 
on 
the 
nucleus 
of 
the 
dream. 
Experience 
gained 
from 
analyses—not 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
dream—teaches 
us 
that 
with 
children 
a 
fond 
wish 
left 
from 
the 
waking 
state 
suffices 
to 
evoke 
a 
dream, 
which 
is 
coherent 
and 
senseful, 
but 
almost 
always 
short, 
and 
easily 
recognizable 
asa 
“wishfulfillment.” 


WRU—ch. 
VI 


The 
psychic 
activity 
in 
dream-formation 
resolves 
itself 
into 
two 
achievements: 
the 
production 
of 
the 
dream-thoughts 
and 
the 
transformation 
of 
these 
into 
the 
dream-content. 
The 
dream-thoughts 
are 
perfectly 
accurate, 
and 
are 
formed 
with 
all 
the 
psychic 
profusion 
of 
which 
we 
are 
capable; 
they 
belong 
to 
the 
thoughts 
which 
have 
not 
become 
conscious, 
from 
which 
our 
conscious 
thoughts 
also 
result 
by 
means 
of 
a 
certain 
transposition. 
There 
is 
doubtless 
much 
in 
them 
that 
is 
worth 
knowing, 
and 
also 
mysterious, 
but 
these 
problems 
have 
no 
particular 
relation 
to 
our 
dreams, 
and 
cannot 
claim 
to 
be 
treated 
under 
the 
head 
of 
dream-problems. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
we 
have 
the 
process 
which 
changes 
the 
unconscious 
thoughts 
into 
the 
dream-content, 
which 
is 
peculiar 
to 
the 
dream-life 
and 
characteristic 
of 
it. 
Now, 
this 
peculiar 
dream-workismuchfartherremovedfromthepatternofwaking 
thought 
than 
has 
been 
supposed 
by 
even 
the 
most 
decided 
depreciators 
of 
the 
psychic 
activity 
in 
dream-formation. 
It 
is 
not 
so 
much 
that 
it 
is 
more 
negligent, 
more 
incorrect, 
more 
forgetful, 
more 
incomplete 
than 
waking 
thought; 
it 
is 
something 
altogether 
different, 
qualitatively, 
from 
waking 
thought, 
and 
cannot 
therefore 
be 
compared 
with 
it. 
It 
does 
not 
think, 
calculate, 
or 
judge 
at 
all, 
but 
limits 
itself 
to 
the 
work 
of 
transformation. 
It 
may 
be 
exhaustively 
described 
if 
we 
do 
not 
lose 
sight 
of 
the 
conditions 
which 
its 
product 
must 
satisfy. 
This 
product, 
the 
dream, 
has 
above 
all 
to 
be 
withdrawn 
from 
the 
censorship, 
and 
to 
this 
end 
the 
dream-work 
makes 
use 
of 
the 
displacement 
of 
psychic 
intensities, 
even 
to 
the 
transvaluation 
of 
all 
psychic 
values; 
thoughts 
must 
be 
exclusively 
or 
predominantly 
reproduced 
in 
the 
material 
of 
visual 
and 
acoustic 
memory-traces, 
and 
from 
this 
requirement 
there 
proceeds 
the 
regard 
of 
the 
dream-work 
for 
representability, 
which 
it 
satisfies 
by 
fresh 
displacements. 
Greater 
intensities 
have 
(probably) 
to 
be 
produced 
than 
are 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
the 
night 
dream-thoughts, 
and 
this 
purpose 
is 
served 
by 
the 
extensive 
condensation 
to 
which 
the 
constituents 
of 
the 
dream-thoughts 
are 
subjected. 
Little 
attention 
is 
paid 
to 
the 
logical 
relations 
of 
the 
thought



material; 
they 
ultimately 
find 
a 
veiled 
representation 
in 
the 
formal 
peculiarities 
of 
the 
dream. 
The 
effects 
of 
the 
dream-thoughts 
undergo 
slighter 
alterations 
than 
their 
conceptual 
content. 
As 
a 
rule, 
they 
are 
suppressed; 
where 
they 
are 
preserved, 
they 
are 
freed 
from 
the 
concepts 
and 
combined 
in 
accordance 
with 
their 
similarity. 
Only 
one 
part 
of 
the 
dream-work—the 
revision, 
variable 
in 
amount, 
which 
is 
effected 
by 
the 
partially 
awakened 
conscious 
thought—is 
at 
all 
consistent 
with 
the 
conception 
which 
the 
writers 
on 
the 
subject 
have 
endeavoured 
to 
extend 
to 
the 
whole 
performance 
of 
dream-formation. 


IoD—ch.

Dream-Work 
and 
the 
Ego—With 
the 
help 
of 
the 
unconscious, 
every 
dream 
in 
the 
process 
of 
formation 
makes 
a 
demand 
upon 
the 
ego 
for 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
an 
instinct 
(if 
it 
originates 
from 
the 
id) 
or 
for 
the 
solution 
of 
a 
conflict, 
the 
removal 
of 
a 
doubt, 
or 
the 
making 
of 
a 
decision 
(if 
it 
originates 
from 
a 
residue 
of 
preconscious 
activity 
in 
waking 
life). 
The 
sleeping 
ego, 
however, 
is 
focused 
upon 
the 
wish 
to 
maintain

it 
regards 
this 
demand 
as 
a 
disturbance 
and 
seeks 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
the 
disturbance. 
The 
ego 
achieves 
this 
by 
what 
appears 
to 
be 
an 
act 
of 
compliance: 
it 
meets 
the 
demand 
with 
what 
is 
in 
the 
circumstances 
the 
innocent 
fulfillment 
of 
a 
wish 
and 
thus 
disposes 
of 
the 
demand. 
This 
replacement 
of 
a 
demand 
by 
the

of 
a

DROPPING

the

EATING—The 
most 
frequent 
disturbance 
of 
the 
nutritive

is 
anorexia 
through 
withdrawal 
of

Increased 
desire 
to 
eat 
is 
also 
not 
infrequent; 
there 
is 
also 
a 
compulsion 
to 
eat, 
motivated 
by 
a 
fear 
of 
starvation, 
which 
has 
been 
little 
studied. 
As 
an 
hysterical 
defense 
against 
eating, 
the 
symptom 
of 
vomiting 
is 
familiar. 
Refusal 
to

as

The 
ego 
is 
an

it 
is 
dependent 
on 
the 
free 
intercommunication 
of,

the 
possibility 
of 
reciprocal 
interplay

all 
its

its 
desexualized

gives 
evidence

The 
principal 
characteristics 
of 
the 
ego 
are 
these. 
In 
consequence 
of 
the 
relation 
which 
was 
already 
established 
between 
sensory 
perception 
and 



muscular 
action, 
the 
ego 
is 
in 
control 
of 
voluntary 
movement. 
It 
has 
the 
task 
of 
self-preservation. 
As 
regards 
external 
events, 
it 
performs 
that 
task 
by 
becoming 
aware 
of 
the 
stimuli 
from 
without, 
by 
storing 
up 
experiences 
of 
them 
(in 
the 
memory), 
by 
avoiding 
excessive 
stimuli 
(through 
flight), 
by 
dealing 
with 
moderate 
stimuli 
(through 
adaptation) 
and, 
finally, 
by 
learning 
to 
bring 
about 
appropriate 
modifications 
in 
the 
external 
world 
to 
its 
own 
advantage 
(through 
activity). 
As 
regards 
internal 
events, 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
id, 
it 
performs 
that 
task 
by 
gaining 
control 
over 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
instincts, 
by 
deciding 
whether 
they 
shall 
be 
allowed 
to 
obtain 
satisfaction, 
by 
postponing 
that 
satisfaction 
to 
times 
and 
circumstances 
favorable 
in 
the 
external 
world 
or 
by 
suppressing 
their 
excitations 
completely. 
Its 
activities 
are 
governed 
by 
considerations 
of 
the 
tensions 
produced 
by 
stimuli 
present 
within 
it 
or 
introduced 
into 
it. 
The 
raising 
of 
these 
tensions 
is 
in 
general 
felt 
as 
unpleasure 
and 
their 
lowering 
as 
pleasure. 
It 
is 
probable, 
however, 
that 
what 
is 
felt 
as 
pleasure 
or 
unpleasure 
is 
not 
the 
absolute 
degree 
of 
the 
tensions, 
but 
somethingintherhythmof

or

From 
time 
to 
time 
the 
ego 
gives 
up 
its 
connection 
with 
the 
external 
world 
and 
withdraws 
into 
the 
state 
of 
sleep, 
in 
which 
its 
organization 
undergoes 
far-reaching 
changes. 
It 
may 
be 
inferred 
from 
the

of

The

of

to 
its 
relation 
to

and 
we 
are 
thus 
prepared 
to

that 
the 
pathological 
states 
of 
the

The

the 
keeping 
down 
of 
the 
instinctual

of

and 
for 
this 
end 
the 
ego 
is 
obliged 
to 
maintain 
great 
expenditures 
of 
energy 
upon 
anti-cathexes. 
But 
the 
claims 
made 
by 
the

may 
become 
so

or 
of 
protecting 
itself 
from

by 
means 
of

can 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
id. 
That 
is 
the 
business 
of 
the 
ego, 
which 
is 
also 
concerned 
with 
discovering 
the 
most 
favorable

method 
of 
obtaining

in 
raising

a 
higher 
dynamic 
level 
(perhaps 
by 
transforming 
freely

such 
as

its

function 
consists 
in 
interposing, 
between 
the 
demand 
made 
by 
an 
instinct 
and 
the 
action 
that 
satisfies 
it, 
an 
intellective 
activity 
which, 
after 
considering 
the 
present 
state 
of 
things 
and 
weighing 
up

EGO 
AND 
ITS 
RELATIONSHIP 
TO 
THE 
ID—Under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
real 
external 
world 
which 
surrounds 
us, 
one 
portion 
of 
the 
id 
has 
undergone 
a 
special 
development. 
From 
what 
was 
originally 
a 
cortical 
layer, 
provided 
with 
organs 
for 
receiving 
stimuli 
and 
with 
apparatus 
for 
protection 
against 
excessive 
stimulation, 
a 
special 
organization 
has 
arisen 
which 
henceforward 
acts 
as 
an 
intermediary 
between 
the 
id 
and 
the 
external

In 
several 
points 
the 
Ego 
and 
the

differ 
sharply 
from 
each 
other. 
Psychical 
acts 
issue

which

The 
ego 
represents 
what 
we 
call 
reason 
and 
sanity, 
in 
contrast 
to 
the 
id 
which 
containsthepassions. 
E 
&I—ch.

In 
the 
Id 
there 
are 
no 
conflicts; 
contradictions 
and 
antitheses 
exist 
side 
by 
side, 
and 
often 
equalize 
matters 
between 
themselves 
by 
compromise 
formations. 
But 
the 
Ego, 
in 
similar 
case, 
feels 
a 
conflict 
which 
must 
be 
decided, 
and 
the 
decision 
consists 
in 
giving 
up 
one 
impulse 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
other. 
The 
Ego 
is 
an 
organization, 
marked 
out 
by 
a 
very 
noteworthy 
tendency 
toward 
unity 
andsynthesis; 
theId 
hasnot 
this 
character—it 
is, 
so 
to 
speak, 
all 
in 
pieces, 
and 
its 
individual 
impulses 
pursue 
their 
ends 
independently 
and 
regardlessofoneanother. 


QLA—ch. 
2 


[The] 
instincts 
fill 
the 
Id; 
to 
put 
it 
shortly, 
all 
energy 
in 
the 
Id 
comes 
from 
them. 
The 
forces 
in 
the 
Ego, 
too, 
have 
no 
other 
origin, 
they 
are 
all 
derived 
from 
those 
in 
the 
Id. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
instincts 
in 
the 
Id 
press 
for 
immediate 
satisfaction, 
regardless 
of 
all 
else, 
and 
in 
this 
way 
either 
fail 
of 
achievement 
or 
actually 
do 
damage. 
It 
is 
the 
Ego’s 
task 
to 
avert 
these 
mishaps, 
to 
mediate 
between 
thepretensionsoftheIdandpreventionsofthe 
outer 
world.

There 
is 
no 
natural

between

and 
in 
a 
healthy 
case 
there 
is 
in 
practice 
no 
division 
between 
them. 
. 
. 
. 
So 
long 
as 
the 
Ego, 
and 
its 
connections 
with 
the 
Id, 
fulfill 
these 
ideal 
requirements 
there

The 
Id 
is 
the 
older; 
the 
Ego 
has 
developed 
out 
of 
it 
through 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
outer 
world 
as 
the 
bark 
develops 
around 
a 
tree. 
Our 
primary 
instincts 
start 
in 
the 
Id; 
all 
processes 
in 
the 
Id 
are 
unconscious. 
The 
Ego 
corresponds, 
as 
I 
have 
mentioned, 
with 
the 
realm 
of 
the 
preconscious; 
parts 
of 
it 
normally 
remain 
unconscious. 
The 
psychical 
processes 
in 
the 
“Id” 
obey 
quite 
different 
laws; 
their 
course 
and 
the 
influence 
they 
exert 
on 
one 
another 
are 
different 
from 
those 
that 
reign 
in 
the 
Ego. 
It 
is 
the 
discovery 
of 
these 
differences 
that 
hasguidedus 
toournewunderstanding 
andlendsconfirmationtoit. 


The 
repressed 
material 
must 
be 
regarded 
as 
belonging 
to 
the 
Id 
and 
obeys 
its 
mechanisms; 
it 
differs 
from 
it 
only 
in 
respect 
of 
its 
genesis. 
This 
differentiation 
takes 
place 
during 
the 
early 
period, 
while 
the 
Ego 
is 
developing 
out 
of 
the 
Id. 
Then 
the 
Ego 
takes 
possession 
of 
part 
of 
the 
Id 
and 
raises 
itto 
thepreconscious 
level; 
otherparts 
are 
thus 
not 
affected 
and 
remain 
in 
the 
Id 
as 
the 
“unconscious” 
proper. 
. 
. 
. 
As 
regards 
the 
passage 
between 
the 
two 
mental 
provinces 
we 
assume, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
that 
unconscious 
processes 
in 
the 
Id 
can 
be 
raised 
to 
a 
preconscious 
level 
and 
incorporated 
into 
the 
Ego, 
and, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
that 
preconscious 
material 
in 
the 
Ego 
can 
travel 
the 
oppositeway 
andbe 
shiftedbackinto 
the 
Id. 


M 
&M—PartIII, 
SectionI 


One 
can 
hardly 
go 
wrong 
in 
regarding 
the 
ego 
as 
that 
part 
of 
the 
id 
which 
has 
been 
modified 
by 
its 
proximity 
to 
the 
external 
world 
and 
the 
influence 
that 
the 
latter 
has 
had 
on 
it, 
and 
which 
serves 
the 
purpose 
of 
receiving 
stimuli 
and 
protecting 
the 
organism 
from 
them, 
like 
the 
cortical 
layer 
with 
which 
a 
particle 
of 
living 
substance 
surrounds 
itself. 
This 
relation 
to 
the 
external 
world 
is 
decisive 
for 
the 
ego. 
. 
. 
. 
In 
popular 
language 
we 
may 
say 
that 
the 
ego 
stands 
for 
reason 
and 
circumspection, 
while 
the 
id 
stands 
for 
the 
untamed 
passions. 


NILP—ch. 
3 


On 
the 
whole 
the 
ego 
has 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
intentions 
of 
the 
id; 
it 
fulfils 
its 
duty 
if 
it 
succeeds 
in 
creating 
the 
conditions 
under 
which 
these 
intentions 
can 
best 
be 
fulfilled. 
One 
might 
compare 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
ego 
to 
the 
id 
with 
that 
between 
a 
rider 
and 
his 
horse. 
The 
ego 
has 
separated 
itself 
off 
from 
one 
part 
of 
the 
id 
by 
means 
of 
repression-resistances. 
But 
the 
barrier 
of 
repression 
does 
not 
extend 
into 
the 
id; 
so 
that 
the 
repressed 
material 
merges 
into 
the 
rest

EGO

but 
parts 
of 
the 
Ego 
are 
unconscious.

EGO-LIBIDO—We 
have 
laid 
down 
the 
concept 
of 
libido 
as 
a 
force 
of 
variable 
quantity 
by 
which 
processes 
and 
transformations 
in 
the 
spheres 
of 
sexual 
excitement 
can 
be 
measured. 
This 
libido 
we 
distinguished 
from 
the 
energy 
which 
is 
at 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
psychic 
processes 
in 
general 
as 
far 
as 
their 
special 
origin 
is 
concerned, 
and 
we 
thus 
attribute 
to 
it 
also 
a 
qualitative 
character. 
In 
separating 
libidinal 
from 
other 
psychic 
energy, 
we 
give 
expression 
to 
the 
assumption 
that 
the 
sexual 
processes 
of 
the 
organism 
are 
differentiated 
from 
the 
nutritional 
processes 
through 
a 
special 
chemism. 
The 
analyses 
of 
perversions 
and 
psychoneuroses 
have 
taught 
us 
that 
this 
sexual 
excitement 
is 
furnished 
not 
only 
from 
the 
so-called 
sexual 
parts 
alone, 
but 
from 
all 
organs 
of 
the 
body. 
We 
thus 
formulate 
for 
ourselves 
the 
concept 
of 
a 
libido-quantum, 
the 
psychic 
representative 
of 
which 
we 
designate 
as 
the 
ego



libido. 
The 
production, 
increase, 
distribution, 
and 
displacement 
of 
this 
ego-
libido, 
thus 
offer 
the 
possible 
explanation 
for 
the 
manifest 
psychosexual 
phenomena. 


But 
this 
ego-libido 
can 
only 
become 
conveniently 
accessible 
to 
psychoanalytic 
study 
if 
its 
psychic 
energy 
is 
invested 
or 
occupied 
(cathexis) 
in 
sexual 
objects; 
that 
is, 
if 
it 
becomes 
objectlibido. 
We 
can 
then 
see 
it 
as 
it 
concentrates 
and 
fixes 
itself 
on 
objects, 
or 
as 
it 
leaves 
those 
objects 
and 
passes 
over 
to 
others, 
from 
which 
position 
it 
directs 
the 
individual’s 
sexual 
activity; 
that 
is, 
as 
it 
leads 
to 
partial 
and 
temporary 
extinction 
of 
the 
libido.

EGO-RESISTANCE—The 
resistance 
which 
we 
have 
to 
overcome 
in 
analysis 
is 
produced 
by 
the 
ego, 
which 
clings 
tenaciously 
to 
its 
anticathexes. 
The 
ego 
finds 
it 
difficult 
to 
turn 
its 
attention 
to 
perceptions 
and 
ideas 
the 
avoidance 
of 
which 
it 
had 
until 
then 
made 
a 
rule, 
or 
to 
acknowledge 
as 
belonging 
to 
it 
impulses 
which 
constitute 
the 
most 
complete 
antithesis 
to 
those 
familiar 
to 
it 
as 
its 
own. 
Our 
combating 
of 
resistance 
in 
the 
analysis 
is 
based 
upon 
this 
conception 
of 
it. 
We 
make 
the 
resistance 
conscious 
where, 
as 
so 
often, 
in 
consequence 
of 
its 
connection 
with 
the 
repressed, 
it 
is 
unconscious; 
we 
oppose 
logical 
arguments 
to 
it 
when 
or 
after 
it 
has 
become 
conscious, 
promising 
the 
ego 
advantages 
and 
rewards 
if 
it 
renounces 
the 
resistance. 
As 
regards 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
ego 
there 
is 
therefore 
nothing 
to 
call 
into 
question 
or 
to 
correct. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
question 
is 
whether 
resistance 
alone 
covers 
the 
situation 
that 
confronts 
us 
in 
analysis. 
We 
experience 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
ego 
still 
finds 
it 
difficult 
to 
nullify 
its 
repressions 
even 
after 
it 
has 
resolved 
to 
give 
up 
its 
resistances, 
and 
we 
have 
designated 
the 
phase 
of 
strenuous 
effort 
which 
follows 
upon 
this 
laudable 
resolution 
as 
theperiodof

FALLING—To

need 
not

The

diverse

may

themselves

that 
the

as 
is 
well 
known, 
based 
upon 
the

who 
is 
almost 
always 
male, 
not 
recognizing 
the 
fact 
that 
women 
have 
no 
penis—a 
fact 
which 
is 
exceedingly 
distasteful 
to 
him 
because 
of 
the 
evidence 
it 
affords 
of 
the 
possibility 
of 
his 
being 
castrated 
himself. 
He 
therefore 
rejects 
the 
perception 
ofhisownsenses,whichshowedhim 
thatwomen’s 
genitalslack 
a 
penis, 
and 
holds 
fast 
to 
the 
opposite 
conviction. 
The 
rejected 
perception, 
however, 
does 
not 
remain 
entirely 
without 
effects, 
for, 
in 
spite 
of 
everything, 
the 
patient 
has 
not 
the 
courage 
to 
assert 
that 
he 
really 
saw 
a 
penis. 
He 
snatches 
hold 
of 
something 
else 
instead—a 
part 
of 
the 
body 
or 
some 
other 
object—and 
attributes 
to 
it 
the 
rôle 
of 
the 
penis 
which 
he 
cannot 
do 
without. 
It 
is 
usually 
something 
that 
he 
actually 
saw 
at 
the 
moment 
at 
which 
he 
saw 
the 
woman’s 
genitals, 
or 
it 
is 
something 
which 
can 
suitably 
serve 
as 
a 
symbolic 
substitute 
for 
the

Now 
it 
would 
not 
be

to 
describe 
this 
process 
which 
accompanies 
the 
formation 
of 
a

Forgetting

it 
happens 
that, 
however 
much

the

one 
of 
his

But 
when, 
by 
a 
piece

we 
have 
removed 
a 
difficulty 
which 
has

Forgetting, 
Mechanism 
of—I 
can 
perhaps 
give 
the 
following 
outline 
concerning 
the 
mechanism 
of 
actual 
forgetting. 
The 
memory 
material 
succumbs 
in 
general 
to 
two 
influences, 
condensation 
and 
distortion. 
Distortion 
is 
the 
work 
of 
the 
tendencies 
dominating 
the 
psychic 
life 
and 
directs 
itself 
above 
all 
against 
the 
affective 
remnants 
of 
memory 
traces 
which 
maintain 
a 
more 
resistive 
attitude 
towards 
condensation. 
The 
traces 
which 
have 
grown 
indifferent, 
merge 
into 
a 
process 
of 
condensation 
without 
opposition; 
in 
addition, 
it 
may 
be 
observed 
that 
tendencies 
of 
distortion 
also 
feed 
on 
the 
indifferent 
material, 
because 
they 
have 
not 
been 
gratified 
where 
they 
wished 
to 
manifest 
themselves. 
As 
these 
processes 
of 
condensation 
and 
distortion 
continue 
for 
long 
periods, 
during 
which 
all 
fresh 
experiences 
act 
upon 
the 
transformation 
of 
the 
memory 
content, 
it 
is 
our 
belief 
that 
it 
is 
time 
that 
makes 
memory 
uncertain 
and 
indistinct. 
It 
is 
quite 
probable 
that 
in 
forgetting, 
there 
can 
really 
be 
no 
question 
of 
a 
direct 
function 
of 
time. 
From 
the 
repressed 
memory 
traces, 
it 
can 
be 
verified 
that 
they 
suffer 
no 
changes 
even 
in 
the 
longest 
periods. 
The 
unconscious, 
at 
all 
events, 
knows 
no 
time 
limit. 
The 
most 
important, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
most 
peculiar 
character 
of 
psychic 
fixation 
consists 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
all 
impressions 
are, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
retained 
in 
the 
same 
form 
as 
they 
were 
received, 
and 
also 
in 
the 
forms 
that 
they 
have 
assumed 
in 
their 
further 
development. 
This 
state 
of 
affairs 
cannot 
be 
elucidated 
by 
any 
comparison 
from 
any 
other 
sphere. 
By 
virtue 
of 
this 
theory, 
every 
former 
state 
of 
the 
memory 
content 
may 
thus 
be 
restored, 
even 
though

Forgetting 
of 
Names—I 
was 
led 
to 
examine 
exhaustively 
the 
phenomenon 



of 
temporary 
forgetfulness 
through 
the 
observation 
of 
certain 
peculiarities, 
which, 
although 
not 
general, 
can, 
nevertheless, 
be 
seen 
clearly 
in 
some 
cases. 
In 
these, 
there 
is 
not 
only 
forgetfulness, 
but 
also 
false 
recollection; 
he 
who 
strives 
for 
the 
escaped 
name 
brings 
to 
consciousness 
others—substitutive 
names—which, 
although 
immediately 
recognized 
as 
false, 
nevertheless 
obtrude 
themselves 
with 
great 
tenacity. 
The 
process 
which 
should 
lead 
to 
the 
reproduction 
of 
the 
lost 
name 
is, 
as 
it 
were, 
displaced, 
and 
thus 
brings 
one 
to 
anincorrectsubstitute. 


Now 
it 
is 
my 
assumption 
that 
the 
displacement 
is 
not 
left 
to 
psychic 
arbitrariness, 
but 
that 
it 
follows 
lawful 
and 
rational 
paths. 
In 
other 
words, 
I 
assume 
that 
the 
substitutive 
name 
(or 
names) 
stands 
in 
direct 
relation 
to 
the 
lost 
name, 
and 
I 
hope, 
if 
I 
succeed 
in 
demonstrating 
this 
connection, 
to 
throw 
light 
on 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
forgetting 
of 
names. 
. 
. 
. 
When 
we 
recapitulate 
the 
conditions 
for 
forgetting 
a 
name 
with 
faulty 
recollection 
we 
find: 
(1) 
a 
certain 
disposition 
to 
forget 
the 
name; 
(2) 
a 
process 
of 
suppression 
which 
has 
taken 
place 
shortly 
before; 
and 
(3) 
the 
possibility 
of 
establishing 
an 
outer 
association 
between 
the 
concerned 
name 
and 
the 
element 
previously 
suppressed. 
The 
last 
condition 
will 
probably 
not 
have 
to 
be 
much 
overrated, 
for 
the 
slightest 
claim 
on 
the 
association 
is 
apt 
in 
most 
cases 
to 
bring 
it 
about. 
But 
it 
is 
a 
different 
and 
farther-reaching 
question 
whether 
such 
outer 
association 
can 
really 
furnish 
the 
proper 
condition 
to 
enable 
the 
suppressed 
element 
to 
disturb 
the 
reproduction 
of 
the 
desired 
name, 
or 
whether 
after 
all 
a 
more 
intimate 
connection 
between 
the 
two 
themes 
is 
not 
necessarily 
required. 
On 
superficial 
consideration, 
one 
may 
be 
willing 
to 
reject 
the 
latter 
requirement 
and 
consider 
the 
temporal 
meeting 
in 
perfectly 
dissimilar 
contents 
assufficient. 
Butonmorethoroughexamination,one 
finds 
more 
and 
more 
frequently 
that 
the 
two 
elements 
(the 
repressed 
and 
the 
new 
one) 
connected 
by 
an 
outer 
association, 
possess 
besides 
a 
connection 
in 
content. 
. 
. 
. 
I 
believe 
that 
one 
is 
not 
justified 
in 
separating 
the 
cases 
of 
name-
forgetting 
with 
faulty 
recollection 
from 
those 
in 
which 
incorrect 
substitutive 
names 
have 
not 
obtruded 
themselves. 
. 
. 
. 
Besides 
the 
simple 
forgetting 
of 
propernames,thereis 
another 
forgetting 
whichis 
motivated 
byrepression.

The 
mechanism 
of 
forgetting, 
or 
rather 
of 
losing 
or 
temporary 
forgetting 
of 
a 
name, 
consists 
in 
the 
disturbance 
of 
the 
intended 
reproduction 
of 
the 
name 
through 
a 
strange 
stream 
of 
thought 
unconscious 
at 
the 
time. 
Between 
the 
disturbed 
name 
and 
the 
disturbing 
complex, 
there 
exists 
a 
connection 



either 
from 
the 
beginning 
or 
such 
a 
connection 
has 
been 
formed—perhaps 
by 
artificialmeans—throughsuperficial(outer)associations. 


The 
self-reference 
complex 
(personal, 
family 
or 
professional) 
proves 
to 
be 
the 
most 
effective 
of 
the 
disturbing 
complexes. 
. 
. 
. 
To 
avoid 
the 
awakening 
of 
pain 
through 
memory 
is 
one 
of 
the 
objects 
among 
the 
motives 
of 
these 
disturbances. 


In 
general, 
one 
may 
distinguish 
two 
principal 
cases 
of 
name-forgetting; 
whenthename 
itself 
touches 
somethingunpleasant,or 
when 
itisbroughtinto 
connection 
with 
other 
associations 
which 
are 
influenced 
by 
such 
effects. 
Thus, 
names 
can 
be 
disturbed 
on 
their 
own 
account 
or 
on 
account 
of 
their 
neareror 
more 
remoteassociativerelations 
inthereproduction. 


A 
review 
of 
these 
general 
principles 
readily 
convinces 
us 
that 
the 
temporary 
forgetting 
of 
a 
name 
is 
observed 
as 
the 
most 
frequent 
faulty 
action 
ofourmentalfunctions. 


However, 
we 
are 
far 
from 
having 
described 
all 
the 
peculiarities 
of 
this 
phenomenon. 
I 
also 
wish 
to 
call 
attention 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
name-forgetting 
is 
extremely 
contagious. 
In 
a 
conversation 
between 
two 
persons, 
the 
mere 
mention 
of 
having 
forgotten 
this 
or 
that 
name 
by 
one 
often 
suffices 
to 
induce 
the 
same 
memory 
slip 
in 
the 
other. 
But 
wherever 
the 
forgetting 
is 
induced, 
thesought-forname 
easilycomes 
tothesurface. 


There 
is 
also 
a 
continuous 
forgetting 
of 
names 
in 
which 
whole 
chains 
of 
names 
are 
withdrawn 
from 
memory. 
If, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
endeavoring 
to 
discover 
an 
escaped 
name, 
one 
finds 
others 
with 
which 
the 
latter 
is 
intimately 
connected, 
it 
often 
happens 
that 
these 
new 
names 
also 
escape. 
The 
forgetting 
thus 
jumps 
from 
one 
name 
to 
another, 
as 
if 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
hindrancenottobeeasilyremoved.

when

that

although 
there

of 
the

preciselywith

raises 
the 
most 
fascinating 
minor 
problems, 
but 
we 
must 
hurry 
on. 
The 
rest 
of 
our 
enquiry 
is 
made 
easy 
because 
this 
God-Creator 
is 
openly 
called

Psychoanalysis

that

really

the

clothed 
in 
the 
grandeur 
in

The

as 
it 
is 
called 
in 
disregard 
of 
the

that 
the

does 
not 
feel 
it 
and 
is 
not 
aware 
of 
it 
.

is 
evidently 
the 
portion 
of 
the 
resistance 
contributed 
by 
a 
superego 
that 
has 
grown 
peculiarly 
severe 
and 
cruel. 
The 
patient 
must 
not 
be 
healthy, 
he 
must 
remain 
ill, 
for 
he 
deserves 
no 
better.

men 
who 
have 
started 
in 
our 
times 
an 
energetic 
action 
against 
the 
legal 
restrictions 
of 
their 
sexual 
activity 
are 
fond 
of 
representing 
themselves 
through 
theoretical 
spokesmen 
as 
evincing 
a 
sexual 
variation, 
which 
may 
be 
distinguished 
from 
the 
very 
beginning, 
as 
an 
intermediate 
stage 
of 
sex 
or 
as 
“a 
third 
sex.” 
In 
other 
words, 
they 
maintain 
that 
they 
are 
men 
who 
are 
forced 
by 
organic 
determinants 
originating 
in 
the 
germ 
to 
find 
that 
pleasure 
in 
the 
man 
which 
they 
cannot 
feel 
in 
the 
woman. 
As 
much 
as 
one 
would 
wish 
to 
subscribe 
to 
their 
demands 
out 
of 
humane 
considerations, 
one 
must 
nevertheless 
exercise 
reserve 
regarding 
their 
theories 
which 
were 
formulated 
without 
regard 
for 
the 
psychogenesis 
of 
homosexuality. 
. 
. 
. 
In 
all 
our 
male 
homosexuals 
there 
was 
a 
very 
intensive 
erotic 
attachment 
to 
a 
feminine 
person, 
as 
a 
rule 
to 
the 
mother, 
which 
was 
manifest 
in 
the 
very 
first 
period 
of 
childhood 
and 
later 
entirely 
forgotten 
by 
the 
individual. 
This 
attachment 
was 
produced 
or 
favored 
by 
too 
much 
love 
from 
the 
mother 
herself, 
but 
was 
also 
furthered 
by 
the 
retirement 
or 
absence 



of 
the 
father 
during 
the 
childhood 
period. 
. 
. 
. 
Following 
this 
primary 
stage, 
a 
transformation 
takes 
place 
whose 
mechanisms 
we 
know 
but 
whose 
motive 
forces 
we 
have 
not 
yet 
grasped. 
The 
love 
of 
the 
mother 
cannot 
continue 
to 
develop 
consciously 
so 
that 
it 
merges 
into 
repression. 
The 
boy 
represses 
the 
love 
for 
the 
mother 
by 
putting 
himself 
in 
her 
place, 
by 
identifying 
himself 
with 
her, 
and 
by 
taking 
his 
own 
person 
as 
a 
model 
through 
the 
similarity 
of 
which 
he 
is 
guided 
in 
the 
selection 
of 
his 
love 
object. 
He 
thus 
becomes 
homosexual; 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
he 
returns 
to 
the 
stage 
of 
autoerotism, 
for 
the 
boys 
whom 
the 
growing 
adult 
now 
loves 
are 
only 
substitutive 
persons 
or 
revivals 
of 
his 
own 
childish 
person, 
whom 
he 
loves 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
his 
mother 
loved 
him. 
We 
say 
that 
he 
finds 
his 
love 
object 
on 
the 
road 
to 
narcissism, 
for 
the 
Greek 
legend 
called 
a 
boy 
Narcissus 
to 
whom 
nothing 
was 
more 
pleasing 
than 
his 
own 
mirrored 
image, 
and 
who 
became 
transformed 
into 
abeautiful 
flowerofthisname. 


Deeper 
psychological 
discussions 
justify 
the 
assertion 
that 
the 
person 
who 
becomes 
homosexual 
in 
this 
manner 
remains 
fixed 
in 
his 
unconscious 
on 
the 
memory 
picture 
of 
his 
mother. 
By 
repressing 
the 
love 
for 
his 
mother 
he 
conserves 
the 
same 
in 
his 
unconscious 
and 
henceforth 
remains 
faithful 
to 
her. 
When 
as 
a 
lover 
he 
seems 
to 
pursue 
boys, 
he 
really 
thus 
runs 
away 
from 
womenwho

You

expect

to 
tell 
you 
much 
that 
is 
new 
about 
the 
id, 
except 
its 
name. 
It 
is 
the 
obscure 
inaccessible 
part 
of 
our 
personality; 
the 
little 
we 
know 
about 
it 
we 
have 
learnt 
from 
the 
study 
of 
dream-work 
and 
the 
formation 
of 
neurotic 
symptoms, 
and 
most 
of 
that 
is 
of 
a 
negative 
character, 
and 
can 
only 
be 
described 
as 
being 
all 
that 
the 
ego 
is 
not. 
We 
can 
come 
nearer 
to 
the 
id 
with 
images, 
and 
call 
it 
a 
chaos, 
a 
cauldron 
of 
seething 
excitement. 
We 
suppose 
that 
it 
is 
somewhere 
in 
direct 
contact 
with 
somatic 
processes, 
and 
takes 
over 
from 
them 
instinctual 
needs 
and 
gives 
them 
mental 
expression, 
but 
we 
cannot 
say 
in 
what 
substratum 
this 
contact 
is 
made. 
These 
instincts 
fill 
it 
with 
energy, 
but 
it 
has 
no 
organization 
and 
no 
unified 
will, 
only 
an 
impulsion 
to 
obtain 
satisfaction 
for 
the 
instinctual 
needs, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
pleasure-principle. 
The 
laws 
of 
logic—above 
all, 
the 
law 
of 
contradiction—do 
not 
hold 
for 
processes 
in 
the 
id. 
Contradictory 
impulses 
exist 
side 
by 
side 
without 
neutralizing 
each 
other 
or 
drawing 
apart; 
at 
most 
they 
combine 
in 
compromise 
formations 
under 
the 
overpowering 
economic 
pressure 
towards 
discharging 
their 
energy. 
There 
is 
nothing 
in 
the 
id 
which 
can 
be 
compared 
to 
negation, 
and 
we 
are 
astonished 
to 
find 
in 
it 
an 
exception 
to 
the 
philosophers’ 
assertion 
that 
space 
and 
time 
are 
necessary 
forms 
of 
our 
mental 
acts. 
In 
the 
id 
there 
is 
nothing 
corresponding 
to 
the 
idea 
of 
time, 
no 
recognition 
of 
the 
passage 
of 
time, 
and 
(a 
thing 
which 
is 
very 
remarkable 
and 
awaits 
adequate 
attention 
in 
philosophic 
thought) 
no 
alteration 
of 
mental 
processes 
by 
the 
passage 
of 
time.

Naturally, 
the

Id 
and 
Unconscious—The 
sole 
quality 
that 
rules 
in 
the 
id 
is 
that 
of 
being 
unconscious. 
Id 
and 
unconscious 
are 
as 
intimately 
united 
as 
ego 
and 
preconscious; 
indeed, 
the 
former 
connection 
is 
even 
more 
exclusive. 
If 
we 
look 
back 
at 
the 
developmental 
history 
of 
the 
individual 
and 
of 
his 
psychical 
apparatus, 
we 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
make 
an 
important 
distinction 
in 
the 
id. 
Originally, 
of 
course, 
everything 
was 
id; 
the 
ego 
was 
developed 
out 
of 
the 
id 
by 
the 
continual 
influence 
of 
the 
external 
world. 
In 
the 
course 
of 
this 
slow 
development 
certain 
material 
in 
the 
id 
was 
transformed 
into 
the 
preconscious 
condition 
and 
was 
thus 
taken 
into 
the 
ego. 
Other 
material 
remained 
unaltered 
in 
the 
id, 
as 
its 
hardly 
accessible 
nucleus. 
But 
during 
this 
development 
the 
young 
and 
feeble 
ego 
dropped 
and 
pushed 
back 
into 
the 
unconscious 



condition 
certain 
material 
which 
it 
had 
already 
taken 
in, 
and 
behaved 
similarly 
in 
regard 
to 
many 
new 
impressions 
which 
it 
might 
have 
taken 
in, 
so 
that 
these 
were 
rejected 
and 
were 
able 
to 
leave 
traces 
in 
the 
id 
only.

IDEAS,

PRECONSCIOUS 
AND 
UNCONSCIOUS—We

that 
what 
distinguishes 
a 
conscious 
idea 
from 
a 
preconscious 
one, 
and 
this 
from 
an 
unconscious 
one, 
cannot 
be 
anything 
but 
a 
modification, 
or 
perhaps 
also 
another 
distribution, 
of 
psychic 
energy. 
We 
speak 
of

IDEAS, 
DESIRED 
AND 
UNDESIRED—On 
falling 
asleep 
the 
“undesired 
ideas” 
emerge, 
owing 
to 
the 
slackening 
of 
a 
certain 
arbitrary 
(and, 
of 
course, 
also 
critical) 
action, 
which 
is 
allowed 
to 
influence 
the 
trend 
of 
our 
ideas; 
we 
are 
accustomed 
to 
speak 
of 
fatigue 
as 
the 
reason 
of 
this 
slackening; 
the 
emerging 
undesired 
ideas 
are 
changed 
into 
visual 
and 
auditory 
images. 
In 
the 
condition 
which 
is 
utilized 
for 
the 
analysis 
of 
dreams 
and 
pathological 
ideas, 
this 
activity 
is 
purposely 
and 
deliberately 
renounced, 
and 
the 
psychic 
energy 
thus 
saved 
(or 
some 
part 
of 
it) 
is 
employed 
in 
attentively 
tracking 
the 
undesired 
thoughts 
which 
now 
come 
to 
the 
surface—thoughts 
which 
retain 
their 
identity 
as 
ideas 
(in 
which 
the 
condition 
differs 
from 
the 
state 
of 
falling 
asleep). 
“Undesired 
ideas” 
are 
thus 
changed 
into 
“desired” 
ones. 
.

The 
“undesired 
ideas” 
habitually 
evoke 
the 
most 
violent

IDENTIFICATION—First, 
identification 
is 
the 
original 
form 
of 
emotional 
tie 
with 
an 
object; 
secondly, 
in 
a 
regressive 
way 
it 
becomes 
a 
substitute 
for 
a 
libidinal 
object 
tie, 
as 
it 
were 
by 
means 
of 
the 
introjection 
of 
the 
object 
into 
the 
ego; 
and 
thirdly, 
it 
may 
arise 
with 
every 
new 
perception 
of 
a 
common 
quality 
shared 
with 
some 
other 
person 
who 
is 
not 
an 
object 
of 
the 
sexual 
instinct.

Identification 
in 
Hysteria—In 
hysteria 
identification 
is 
most 
frequently 
employed 
to 
express 
a 
sexual 
community. 
The 
hysterical 
woman 
identifies 
herself 
by 
her 
symptoms 
most 
readily—though 
not 
exclusively—with 
persons 
with 
whom 
she 
has 
had 
sexual 
relations, 
or 
who 
have 
had 
sexual 
intercourse 
with 
the 
same 
persons 
as 
herself. 
Language 
takes 
cognizance 
of 
this 
tendency: 
two 
lovers 
are 
said 
to 
be 
“one.” 
In 
hysterical 
phantasy, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
dreams, 
identification 
may 
ensue 
if 
one 
simply 
thinks 
of 
sexual 
relations;theyneed

Identification 
and 
Object-Choice—Identification 
is 
a 
very 
important 
kind 
of 
relationship 
with 
another 
person, 
probably 
the 
most 
primitive, 
and 
is 
not 
to 
be 
confused 
with 
object-choice. 
One 
can 
express 
thedifference 
between 
them 
in 
this 
way: 
when 
a 
boy 
identifies 
himself 
with 
his 
father, 
he 
wants 
to 
be 
like 
his 
father; 
when 
he 
makes 
him 
the 
object 
of 
his 
choice, 
he 
wants 
to 
have 
him, 
to 
possess 
him; 
in 
the 
first 
case 
his 
ego 
is 
altered 
on 
the 
model 
of 
his 
father, 
in 
the 
second 
case 
that 
is 
not 
necessary. 
Identification 
and 
object-choice 
are 
broadlyspeaking 
independent 
of 
each 
other; 
butone 
can 
identifyoneself 
with 
a 
person, 
and 
alter 
one’s 
ego 
accordingly, 
and 
take 
the 
same 
person 
as 
one’s 
sexual 
object. 
It 
is 
said 
that 
this 
influencing 
of 
the 
ego 
by 
the 
sexual 
object 
takes 
place 
very 
often 
with 
women, 
and 
is 
characteristic 
of 
femininity. 
. 
. 
. 
If 
one 
has 
lost 
a 
love-object 
or 
has 
had 
to 
give 
it 
up, 
one 
often 
compensates 
oneself 
by 
identifying 
oneself 
with 
it; 
one 
sets 
it 
up 
again 
inside 
one’s 
ego, 
so 
that 
inthis 
caseobject-choiceregresses, 
asit

ILLNESS 


Illness,

may

palliate 
incapacity

Illness 
as 
Self-Punishment—It 
is 
very 
important 
for 
mental 
health 
that 
the 
Super-Ego 
should 
develop 
normally—that 
is, 
that 
it 
should 
become 
sufficiently 
depersonalized. 
It 
is 
precisely 
this 
that 
does 
not 
happen 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
neurotic, 
because 
his 
OEdipus 
complex 
does 
not 
undergo 
the 
right 
transformation. 
His 
Super-Ego 
deals 
with 
his 
Ego 
like 
a 
strict 
father 
with 
a 
child, 
and 
his 
idea 
of 
morality 
displays 
itself 
in 
primitive 
ways 
by 
making 
the 
Ego 
to 
submit 
to 
punishment 
by 
the 
Super-Ego. 
Illness 
is 
employed 
as 
a 
means 
for 
this 
“self-punishment.” 
The 
neurotic 
has 
to 
behave 
as 
though 
he 
were 
mastered 
by 
guilt, 
which 
the 
illness 
serves 
to 
punish, 
and 
so 
to 
relieve 
him.

Inferiority, 
Sense 
of—To 
trace 
it 
back 
to 
the 
perception 
in 
oneself 
of 
some 
organic 
disability 
or 
other, 
as 
the 
school 
of 
so-called 
Individual 
Psychologists 
like 
to 
do, 
seems 
to 
us 
a 
short-sighted 
error. 
The 
sense 
of 
inferiority 
has 
a 
strong 
erotic 
basis. 
The 
child 
feels 
itself 
inferior 
when 
it 
perceives 
that 
it 
is 
not 
loved, 
and 
so 
does 
the 
adult 
as 
well. 
The 
only 
organ 
that 
is 
really 
regarded 
as 
inferior 
is 
the 
stunted 
penis—thegirl’s 
clitoris. 
But 
themajor 
part 
of 
the 
sense 
of 
inferiority 
springs 
from 
the 
relationship 
of 
the 
ego 
to 
its 
superego, 
and, 
like 
the 
sense 
of 
guilt, 
it 
is 
an 
expression 
of 
the 
tension 
between 
them. 
The 
sense 
of 
inferiority 
and 
the 
sense 
of 
guilt 
are 
exceedingly 
difficult 
to 
distinguish. 
Perhaps 
we 
should 
do 
better 
if 
we 
regarded 
the 
former 
as 
the 
erotic 
complementtothesense

as 
an 
isolated 
symptom, 
is 
evidenced 
in 
diminished 
pleasure 
in 
work, 
or 
in 
its 
poor 
execution, 
or 
in 
such 
reactive 
manifestations 
as 
fatigue 
(vertigo, 
vomiting) 
if 
the 
subject 
forces 
himself 
to 
go 
on 
working. 
Hysteria 
compels 
the 
suspension 
of 
work 
by 
producing 
paralysis 
of 
organs 
and 
functions, 
the 
existence 
of 
which 
is

neurosis

loss

time

the 
form

procrastination

repetition. 
[Certain] 
inhibitions 
evidently 
subserve 
a 
desire 
for 
self-punishment, 
as 
for 
example 
not 
infrequently 
those

the 
sphere

vocational 
activity.

dares 
not

certain 
things 
because 
they 
would 
bring 
an 
advantage 
and 
a 
success 
which 
the 
strict 
superego 
has 
forbidden. 
Thereupon 
the 
ego 
renounces 
these 
activities 
also, 
in 
order 
not 
to 
become 
involved 
in 
conflict 
with 
the

is 
easy 
to 
see 
wherein 
an

differs 
from 
a

A

no

as 
a 
process 
taking 
place 
either

The 
two 
concepts 
are 
not 
rooted 
in 
the 
same 
soil. 
Inhibition 
relates 
specifically 
to 
function 
and 
does 
not 
necessarily 
denote 
something 
pathological; 
a 
normal 
restriction 
or 
reduction 
of 
a 
function 
may 
also 
be 
termed 
an 
inhibition 
of 
it. 
To 
speak 
of 
a 
symptom, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
is 
tantamount 
to 
indicating 
a 
morbid 
process. 
Thus 
an 
inhibition 
may 
also 
be 
a 
symptom. 
Our

INSTINCT—The 
forces 
which 
we 
assume 
to 
exist 
behind 
the 
tensions 
caused 
by 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
id 
are 
called 
instincts. 
They 
represent 
the 
somatic 
demands 
upon 
mental 
life. 
Though 
they 
are 
the 
ultimate 
cause 
of 
all 
activity, 
they 
are 
by 
nature 
conservative; 
the 
state, 
whatever 
it 
may 
be, 
which 
a 
living 
thing 
has 
reached, 
gives 
rise 
to 
a 
tendency 
to 
re-establish 
that 
state 
so 
soon 
as 
it 
has 
been 
abandoned. 
It 
is 
possible 
to 
distinguish 
an 
indeterminate 
number 
of 
instincts 
and 
in 
common 
practice 
this 
is 
in 
fact 
done. 
For 
us, 
however, 
the 
important 
question 
arises 
whether 
we 
may 
not 
be 
able 
to 
derive 
all 
of 
these 
various 
instincts 
from 
a 
few 
fundamental 
ones. 
We 
have 
found 
that 
instincts 
can 
change 
their 
aim 
(by 
displacement) 
and 
also 
that 
they 
can 
replace 
one 
another—the 
energy 
of 
one 
instinct 
passing 
over 
to 
another. 
This 
latter 
process 
is 
still 
insufficiently 
understood. 
After 
long 
doubts 
and 
vacillations 
we 
have 
decided 
to 
assume 
the 
existence 
of 
only 
two 
basic 
instincts. 
[See 
Instincts, 
Basic.]

Instinct 
in 
general 
is 
regarded 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
elasticity 
of 
living 
things, 
an 
impulsion 
towards 
the 
restoration 
of 
a 
situation 
which 
once 
existed 
but 
was 
broughttoan 
endby 
some 
externaldisturbance.

An 
instinct 
differs 
from 
a 
stimulus 
in 
that 
it 
arises 
from 
sources 
of 
stimulation 
within 
the 
body, 
operates 
as 
a 
constant 
force, 
and 
is 
such 
that 
the 
subject 
cannot 
escape 
from 
it 
by 
flight 
as 
he 
can 
from 
an 
external 
stimulus. 
An 
instinct 
may 
be 
described 
as 
having 
a 
source, 
an 
object 
and 
an 
aim. 
The 
source 
is 
a 
state 
of 
excitation 
within 
the 
body, 
and 
its 
aim 
is 
to 
remove 
that 
excitation;

Observation

us 
that 
an 
instinct 
may 
undergo 
the 
following 
vicissitudes: 
reversal 
into 
its 
opposite, 
turning 
round 
upon 
the 
subject, 
repression,sublimation.

themeasureofthedemanduponenergy 
whichitrepresents. 


The 
aim 
of 
an 
instinct 
is 
in 
every 
instance 
satisfaction, 
which 
can 
only 
be 
obtained 
by 
abolishing 
the 
condition 
of 
stimulation 
in 
the

of 
the

we 
have

to

existence 
of 
only 
two 
basic 
instincts, 
Eros 
and 
the 
destructive 
instinct. 


OoPA—ch.

There 
can 
be 
no

of 
restricting 
one 
or 
the 
other 
of 
the 
basic 
instincts 
to 
a 
single 
region 
of 
the 
mind. 
They 
are 
necessarily 
present 
everywhere. 
We 
may 
picture 
an 
initial 
state 
of 
things 
by 
supposing 
that 
the 
whole 
available 
energy 
of 
Eros, 
to 
which 
we 
shall 
henceforward 
give 
the 
name 
of 
libido, 
is 
present 
in 
the 
as 
yet 
undifferentiated 
ego-id 
and 
serves 
to 
neutralize 
the 
destructive 
impulses 
which 
are 
simultaneously 
present. 
(There 
is 
no 
term 
analogous 
to 
“libido” 
for 
describing 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
destructive

INVERSION, 
INVERT—There 
are 
men 
for 
whom 
the 
sexual 
object 
is 
not 
woman 
but 
man, 
and 
there 
are 
women 
for 
whom 
it 
is 
not 
man 
but 
woman. 
Such 
persons 
are 
designated 
as 
contrary 
sexuals, 
or 
better, 
inverts, 
and 
the 
situation 
of 
such 
a 
relationship 
is 
called 
inversion. 
The 
number 
of 
such 
individuals 
is 
considerable, 
although 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
estimate 
them 
accurately. 
. 
. 
. 
Conception 
of 
Inversion. 
The 
first 
studies 
of 
the 
inversion 
gave 
rise 
to 
the 
assumption 
that 
it 
was 
a 
sign 
of 
innate 
nervous 
degeneration. 
This 
harmonizedwiththe 
fact 
that 
physicians 
firstobservedit 
amongnervous 
persons, 
or 
among 
those 
giving 
such 
an 
impression. 
There 
are 
two 
elements 
which 
should 
be 
considered 
independently 
in 
this 
characterization: 
the 
congenitality, 
andthedegeneration. 
. 
.. 
Explanation 
of 
Inversions.The 
nature 



of 
inversion 
is 
explained 
neither 
by 
the 
assumption 
that 
it 
is 
congenital 
nor 
that 
it 
is 
acquired. 
Inthe 
firstcase,weneed 
to 
betoldwhat 
there 
is 
in 
itofthe 
congenital,unless 
we 
aresatisfiedwiththeroughestexplanation,namely,that 
a 
person 
brings 
along 
a 
congenital 
sexual 
instinct 
connected 
with 
a 
definite 
sexual 
object. 
In 
the 
second 
case 
it 
is 
a 
question 
whether 
the 
manifold 
accidental 
influences 
suffice 
to 
explain 
the 
acquisition, 
unless 
there 
is 
something 
in 
the 
individual 
to 
meet 
it 
half 
way. 
The 
negation 
of 
this 
last 
factor 
is 
inadmissible 
according 
to 
our 
former 
conclusions. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
Sexual 
Aim 
of 
the 
Invert. 
The 
important 
fact 
to 
bear 
in 
mind 
is 
that 
no 
uniformity 
of 
the 
sexual 
aim 
can 
be 
attributed 
to 
inversion. 
Intercourse 
per 
anum 
in 
men 
by 
nomeans 
goeswithinversion;masturbationis 
justas 
frequentlytheexclusive 
aim; 
and 
the 
limitation 
of 
the 
sexual 
aim 
to 
mere 
effusion 
of 
feelings 
is 
here 
even 
more 
frequent 
than 
in 
heterosexual 
love. 
In 
women, 
too, 
the 
sexual 
aims 
of 
the 
inverts 
are 
manifold, 
among 
which 
contact

TCTSI 



IRRITABILITY—An 
increase 
of 
irritability 
always 
signifies 
an 
accumulation 
of 
excitation 
or 
an 
inability 
to 
tolerate 
such 
an 
accumulation, 
that

A-N 



ISOLATION—A 
technique 
peculiar 
to 
compulsion 
neurosis, 
is 
that 
of 
isolation. 
Its 
reference 
is 
likewise 
to 
the 
motor 
sphere; 
and 
it 
consists 
in 
the 
interposition, 
after 
an 
unpleasant 
experience, 
as 
also 
after 
some 
act 
of 
the 
subject’s 
own 
which 
is 
of 
significance 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
his 
neurosis, 
of 
a 
refractory 
period 
in 
which 
nothing 
more 
is 
allowed 
to 
happen, 
no 
perception 
registered, 
and 
no 
action 
performed. 
This 
at 
first 
sight 
strange 
behavior 
soon 
betrays 
its 
relation 
to 
repression. 
The 
effect 
of 
this 
isolation 
is 
the 
same, 
as 
in 
repression 
with 
amnesia. 
The 
isolation 
phenomena 
of 
compulsion 
neurosis 
reproduce 
this 
technique, 
but 
intensified 
by 
motor 
means 
and 
with 
a 
magic 
intent 
motor 
isolation 
is 
to 
furnish 
a 
guaranty 
of 
the 
interruption 
of 
coherence 
inthinking.

JEALOUSY—Jealousy 
is 
one 
of 
those 
affective 
states, 
like 
grief, 
that 
may 
be 
described 
as 
normal. 
If 
anyone 
appears 
to 
be 
without 
it, 
the 
inference 
is 
justified 
that 
it 
has 
undergone 
severe 
repression 
and 
consequently 
plays 
all 
the 
greater 
part 
in 
his 
unconscious 
mental 
life. 
The 
instances 
of 
abnormally 
intense 
jealousy 
met 
with 
in

work 
reveal 
themselves 
as 
constructed 
of 
three 
layers. 
The 
three

a

hitherto

may 
experience

since 
not 
all 
laughter 
(but 
surely 
the 
laughter 
of

is 
a 
sign 
of 
pleasure, 
we 
shall 
be 
inclined 
to 
refer 
this 
pleasure 
to 
the 
release 
of 
previously 
existing

The 
preparation 
for 
analytical 
practice 
is 
no 
simple 
and 
easy 
matter; 
the 
work 
is 
hard 
and 
the 
responsibility 
heavy. 
But, 
anyone 
who 
has 
undergone 
such 
a 
discipline, 
has 
been 
analyzed, 
has 
grasped 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
unconscious 
as 
it 
is 
known 
today, 
has 
become 
versed 
in 
the 
scientific 
aspects 
of 
sexuality, 
and 
has 
learned 
the 
delicate 
technique 
of 
psychoanalysis, 
the 
art 
of 
interpretation, 
the 
way 
to 
combat 
resistances,

So 
far 
as 
the 
patient 
is 
concerned, 
it 
does 
not 
matter 
whether 
the

is 
a 
doctor 
or 
not, 
so

as 
the

by 
the 
prescribed 
medical 
opinion 
before 
the 
analysis 
begins, 
and, 
if 
required, 
during 
its 
course. 
For 
him, 
it 
is 
incomparably 
more 
important 
that 
the 
analyst 
should 
possess 
such 
personal 
qualities 
as 
will 
command

LIBIDO—Libido 
is 
a 
term 
used 
in 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
instincts 
for 
describing 
thedynamicmanifestation 
ofsexuality. 
LT 


It 
is 
difficult 
to 
say 
anything 
of 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
libido 
in 
the 
id 
and 
in 
the 
superego. 
Everything 
that 
we 
know 
about 
it 
relates 
to 
the 
ego, 
in 
which 
the 
whole 
available 
amount 
of 
libido 
is 
at 
first 
stored 
up. 
We 
call 
this 
state 
of 
things 
absolute, 
primary 
narcissism. 
It 
continues 
until 
the 
ego 
begins 
to 
cathect 
the 
presentations 
of 
objects 
with 
libido—to 
change 
narcissistic 
libido 
into 
object 
libido.

Libido, 
Ego 
and 
Object—We 
must 
understand 
that 
the 
ego 
is 
always 
the 
main 
reservoir 
of 
libido, 
from 
which 
libidinal 
cathexes 
of 
objects 
proceed, 
and 
into 
which 
they 
return 
again, 
while 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
this 
libido 
remains 
perpetually 
in 
the 
ego. 
There 
is 
therefore 
a 
constant 
transformation 
of 
ego-
libido 
into 
object-libido, 
and 
of 
object-libido 
into 
ego-libido. 
But 
if 
this 
is 
so 
the 
two 
cannot 
differ 
from 
each 
other 
in 
their 
nature, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
point 
in 
distinguishing 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
one 
from 
that

Libido, 
Mobility 
of—A 
characteristic 
of 
libido 
which 
is 
important 
in 
life 
is 
its 
mobility, 
the 
ease 
with 
which 
it 
passes 
from 
one 
object 
to 
another. 
This 
must 
be 
contrasted 
with 
the 
fixation 
of 
libido 
to 
particular 
objects,

LT 


Concerning 
the 
fates 
of 
the 
object-libido, 
we 
can 
also 
state 
that 
it 
may 
be 
withdrawn 
from 
the 
object, 
that 
it 
may 
be 
preserved 
in 
a 
floating 
state 
in 
special 
states 
of 
tension, 
and 
that 
it 
may 
finally 
be 
taken 
back 
into 
the 
ego 
and 
again 
change 
into 
ego-libido 
as 
narcissistic 
libido. 
Through 
psychoanalysis, 
we 
look 
as 
if 
over 
a 
boundary, 
which 
we 
are 
not 
permitted 
to 
pass, 
into 
the 
activity 
of 
this 
narcissistic 
libido, 
and 
thus, 
form 
an 
idea 
of 
the 
relations 
between 
the 
two. 
The 
narcissistic 
or 
ego-libido 
appears 
to 
us 
as 
the 
great 
reservoir 
from 
which 
all 
object 
cathexis 
is 
sent 
out, 
and 
into 
which 
it 
is 
drawn 
back 
again, 
while 
the 
narcissistic 
libido-cathexis 
of 
the 
ego 
appears 
to 
us 
as 
the 
realized 
primal 
state 
in 
the 
first 
childhood, 
which 
only 
becomes 
hidden 
by 
the 
later 
emissions 
of 
libido, 
and 
is 
retained 
at 
the 
bottom 
behind 
them.

Libido, 
Somatic

can 
be 
no

that 
it 
streams 
into

from 
various 
organs 
and 
parts 
of 
the 
body. 
This 
is 
most 
clearly 
seen 
in 
the

of 
the

of 
the

which, 
from

MASOCHISM—Masochism 
comes 
under 
our 
observation 
in 
three 
shapes: 
as 
a 
condition 
under 
which 
sexual 
excitation 
may 
be 
roused; 
as 
an 
expression 
of 
feminine 
nature; 
and 
as 
a 
norm 
of 
behaviour. 
According 
to 
this 
one 
may 
distinguish 
an 
erotogenic,a 
feminine, 
and 
a 
moral 
type 
of 
masochism. 
The 
first, 
the 
erotogenic 
masochism, 
the 
lust 
of 
pain, 
is 
also 
to 
be 
found 
at 
bottom 
in 
the 
other 
forms; 
the 
concept 
of 
it 
can 
be 
supported 
on 
biological 
and 
constitutional 
grounds; 
it 
remains 
incomprehensible 
unless 
one 
can 
bring 
oneself 
to 
make 
certain 
assumptionsabout 
matters 
thatare 
wrapt 
in 
obscurity. 
The 
third, 
in 
certain 
respects 
the 
most 
important 
form 
in 
which 
masochism 
appears, 
has 
only 
lately, 
as 
a 
sense 
of 
guilt 
that 
is 
for 
the 
most 
part 
unconscious, 
been 
properly 
appreciated 
by 
psycho-analysis; 
it 
already 
admits, 
however, 
of 
full 
explanation 
and 
of 
co-ordination 
into 
our 
previous 
knowledge. 
Feminine 
masochism, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
is 
the 
form 
most 
accessible 
to 
observation, 
least 
mysterious, 
and 
is 
comprehensible 
in 
all 
its 
relations.

and 
instinctual 
life. 
The 
repression 
of 
their 
aggressiveness, 
which 
is 
imposed 
upon 
women 
by 
their 
constitutions 
and 
by 
society, 
favours 
the 
development 
of 
strong 
masochistic 
impulses, 
which 
have 
the 
effect 
of 
binding 
erotically 
the 
destructive

Masochism

as

perversion

removed 
from 
the 
normal 
sexual 
goal 
than 
its 
opposite 
[sadism]. 
It 
may 
even 



be 
doubted 
whether 
it 
ever 
is 
primary 
and 
whether 
it 
does 
not 
more 
often 
originate 
through 
transformation 
from 
sadism. 
It 
can 
often 
be

masochism 
is 
nothing

a

MASTURBATION—Anoverwhelmingaetiologicalimportance

They 
make 
them 
responsible 
for 
all

we 
have 
the 
greatest 
difficulty 
in 
getting 
them 
to 
believe 
that 
they 
are 
wrong. 
But 
as 
a 
matter 
of

we

MELANCHOLIA—Melancholia, 
or 
more 
accurately 
the 
melancholic 
attack. 
In 
this 
disease, 
about 
whose 
causes 
and 
mechanism 
we 
know 
far 
too 
little, 
the 
most 
remarkable 
characteristic 
is 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
superego— 
you 
may 
call 
it, 
but 
in 
a 
whisper, 
the 
conscience—treats 
the 
ego. 
The 
melancholiac 
during 
periods 
of 
health 
can, 
like 
any 
one 
else, 
be 
more 
or 
less 
severe 
towards 
himself; 
but 
when 
he 
has 
a 
melancholic 
attack, 
his 
super-ego 
becomes 
over-severe, 
abuses, 
humiliates, 
and 
ill-treats 
his 
unfortunate 
ego, 
threatens 
it 
with 
the 
severest 
punishments, 
reproaches 
it 
for 
long 
forgotten 
actions 
which 
were 
at 
the 
time 
regarded 
quite 
lightly, 
and 
behaves 
as 
though 
it 
had 
spent 
the 
whole 
interval 
in 
amassing 
complaints 
and 
was 
only 
waiting 
for 
its 
present 
increase 
in 
strength 
to 
bring 
them 
forward, 
and 
to 
condemn 
the 
ego 
on 
their 
account. 
The 
super-ego 
has 
the 
ego 
at 
its 
mercy 
and 
applies 
the 
most 
severe 
moral 
standards 
to 
it

the

the 
critical 
voice 
of 
the 
super-ego 
is 
silent, 
the 
ego 
is 
reinstated, 
and 
enjoys 
once 
more 
all 
the 
rights 
of 
man 
until

Concealment

depends 
on 
the 
forgetting 
of 
other 
important 
impressions. 
In 
the 
case

I 
particularly 
emphasized 
a 
peculiarity 
in 
the 
temporal 
relation 
between 
the 
concealing 
memory 
and 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
memory 
concealed 
by 
it. 
The

in

of

while 
the

represented 
by 
it, 
which 
remained 
practically 
unconscious, 
belonged 
to 
a 
later 
period 
of 
the 
individual 
in 
question. 
I 
called 
this 
form 
of 
displacement 
a 
retro-active 
or 
regressive 
one. 
Perhaps 
more 
often, 
one 
finds 
the 
reversed 
relation—that 
is, 
an 
indifferent 
impression 
of 
the 
most 
remote 
period 
becomes 
a 
concealing 
memory 
in 
consciousness, 
which 
simply 
owes 
its 
existence 
to 
an 
association 
with 
an 
earlier 
experience, 
against 
whose 
direct 
reproduction 
there 
are 
resistances. 
We 
would 
call 
these 
encroaching 
or 
interposing 
concealing 
memories. 
What 
most 
concerns 
the 
memory 
lies 
here 
chronologically 
beyond 
the 
concealing 
memory. 
Finally, 
there 
may 
be 
a 
third 
possible 
case, 
namely, 
the 
concealing 
memory 
may 
be 
connected 
with 
the 
impression 
it 
conceals, 
not 
only 
through 
its 
contents, 
but 
also 
through 
contiguity 
of 
time; 
this

Memory, 
Errors 
of—Errors 
of 
memory 
are 
distinguished 
from

false

one 
feature 
only, 
namely, 
that 
the 
error 
(false 
recollection) 
is 
not 
recognized 
as 
such 
but 
finds 
credence. 
However, 
the 
use 
of 
the 
expression 
“error” 
seems 
to 
depend 
on 
still 
another 
condition. 
We 
speak 
of 
“erring” 
instead 
of 
“falsely 
recollecting” 
where 
the 
character 
of 
the 
objective 
reality 
is 
emphasized 
in 
the 
psychic 
material 
to 
be 
reproduced—that 
is, 
where 
something 
other 
than 
a 
fact 
of 
my 
own 
psychic 
life 
is 
to 
be 
remembered, 
or 
rather 
something 
that 
may 
be 
confirmed 
or 
refuted 
through 
the 
memory 
of 
others.

Memory, 
Visual—Some 
[adults] 
recall 
by 
means 
of 
visual

of 
a 
visual 
character; 
other 
individuals 
can 
scarcely 
reproduce 
in 
memory 
the 
most 
paltry 
sketch 
of 
an 
experience; 
we 
call 
such 
persons 
“auditifs” 
and 
“moteurs” 
in 
contrast 
to 
the 
“visuels,” 
terms 
proposed 
by 
Charcot. 
These 
differences 
vanish 
in 
dreams; 
all 
our 
dreams 
are 
preponderatingly 
visual. 
But 
this 
development 
is 
also

are 
plastic 
and 
visual, 
even 
in 
those

lacks

element.

therefore, 
preserves

of 
the

it 
would 
be 
particularly 
interesting 
to 
find 
out 
whether 
mistakes 
of 
considerable 
importance, 
which 
could 
be 
followed 
by 
serious 
results, 
as, 
for 
example, 
those 
of 
physicians 
or 
druggists, 
fall 
within 
the 
range 
of 
our 
point 
of 
view. 
. 
. 
. 
We 
can 
also 
add 
to 
these 
mistakes 
the 
case 
of 
one 
who 
gives 
a 
beggar 
a 
gold 
piece 
in 
place 
of 
a 
copper 
or 
a 
silver 
coin. 
The 
solution 
of 
such 
mishandling 
is 
simple: 
it 
is 
an 
act 
of 
sacrifice 
designed 
to 
mollify 
fate, 
to 
avert 
evil, 
and 
so 
on. 
If 
we 
hear 
a 
tender 
mother 
or 
an 
aunt 
express 
concern 
regarding 
the 
health 
of 
a 
child, 
immediately 
before 
taking 
a 
walk 
during 
which 
she 
displays 
her 
charity, 
contrary 
to 
her 
usual 
habit, 
we 
can 
hardly 
doubt 
the 
sense 
of 
this 
apparently 
undesirable 
accident. 
In 
this 
manner, 
our 
faulty 
acts 
make 
possible 
the 
practice 
of 
all 
those 
pious 
and 
superstitious 
customs 
which 
must 
shun 
the 
light 
of 
consciousness, 
because 
of 
the 
strivings

It 
seems 
that 
neuroses 
are 
only 
acquired 
during 
early

(up

the 
age 
of 
six), 
even 
though 
their 
symptoms 
may 
not 
make 
their 
appearance 
until 
much

The 
infantile 
neurosis 
may 
become

for 
a 
short 
time

may

the

this

Neurosis, 
Formation 
of—As 
a 
consequence 
of 
a 
certain 
experience 
there 
arises 
an 
instinctual 
demand 
which 
claims 
satisfaction. 
The 
ego 
foregoes 
this 
satisfaction, 
either 
because 
it 
is 
paralyzed 
by 
the 
excessiveness 
of 
the 
demand 
or 
because 
it 
recognizes 
in 
it 
a 
danger. 
The 
first 
of 
these 
reasons 
is 
the 
original 
one; 
both 
end 
in 
the 
avoidance 
of 
a 
dangerous 
situation. 
The 
Ego 
guards 
against 
this 
danger 
by 
repression. 
The 
excitation 
becomes 
inhibited 
in 
one 
way 
or 
another; 
the 
incitement, 
with 
the 
observations 
and 
perceptions 



belonging 
to 
it, 
is 
forgotten. 
This, 
however, 
does 
not 
bring 
the 
process 
to 
an 
end; 
either 
the 
instinct 
has 
kept 
its 
strength, 
or 
it 
will 
regain 
it, 
or 
it 
is 
reawakened 
by 
a 
new 
situation. 
It 
renews 
its 
claim 
and—since

gains 
at 
some

point 
new 
access 
to 
a 
so-called 
substitutive 
satisfaction 
which 
now 
appears 
as 
a 
symptom, 
without 
the 
acquiescence 
and 
also 
without 
the 
comprehension

[Neurotic 
disturbance:] 
an 
Ego, 
prevented 
in 
its 
synthetizing 
activity, 
with 
no 
influence 
over 
a 
part 
of 
the 
Id, 
obliged 
to 
renounce 
some 
of 
its 
activities 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
a 
fresh 
collision 
with 
what 
is 
repressed, 
exhausting 
itself 
in 
defense 
reactions—largely 
in 
vain—against 
the 
symptoms 
or 
derivatives 
of 
the 
repressed 
impulses; 
and 
an 
Id 
in 
which 
individual 
instincts 
have 
made 
themselves 
independent, 
pursuing 
their 
own 
aims 
without 
regard 
for 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
whole 
personality, 
and 
obeying 
only 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
primitive 
psychology 
which 
reigns 
in 
the 
depths 
of 
the 
Id. 
If 
we 
survey 
the 
whole 
situation 
it 
becomes 
clear 
that 
there 
is 
a 
simple 
formula 
for 
the 
arising 
of 
a 
neurosis; 
the 
Ego 
has 
made 
an 
attempt 
to 
suppress 
certain 
parts 
of 
the 
Id 
by 
an 
inappropriate 
method, 
and 
this 
has 
miscarried, 
and 
the 
Id 
has 
taken 
its 
revenge. 
Neurosis 
is 
thus 
the 
consequence 
of 
a 
conflict 
between 
Ego 
and 
Id, 
on 
which 
the 
Ego 
centers 
because—as 
further 
investigation 
shows—it 
insists 
throughout 
on 
retaining 
its 
adaptability 
towards 
the 
outer 
world. 
The 
opposition 
lies 
between 
outer 
world 
and 
Id, 
and 
because 
the 
Ego, 
true 
to 
its 
inmost 
nature, 
takes 
sides 
with 
the 
outer 
world, 
it 
becomes 
involved 
in 
conflict 
with 
its 
own 
Id. 
But 
mark 
well 
that 
it 
is 
not 
the 
fact 
of 
this 
conflict 
which 
brings 
about 
the 
illness—for 
such 
opposition 
between 
reality 
and 
Id 
is 
unavoidable, 
and 
the 
Ego’s 
constant 
task 
is 
to 
mediate 
between 
them. 
It 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Ego, 
for 
settling 
the 
conflict, 
has 
employed 
the 
inadequate 
method 
of 
repression. 
But 
this 
in 
turn 
arises 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
at 
the 
time 
when 
this 
task 
was 
presented 
to 
it 
the 
Ego 
was 
undeveloped 
and 
weak.

Neurosis 
and 
Perversion—A 
great 
part 
of 
the 
opposition 
to 
these, 
my 
theories, 
is 
explained 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
sexuality 
from 
which 
I 
deduce 
the 
psychoneurotic 
symptoms 
is 
thought 
of 
as 
coincident 
with 
the 
normal 
sexual 
instinct. 
But 
psychoanalysis 
teaches 
us 
more 
than 
that. 
It 
shows 
that 
the 
symptoms 
do 
not 
by 
any 
means 
result 
at 
the 
expense 
only 
of 
the 
so-called 
normal 
sexual 
instinct 
(at 
least 
not 
exclusively 
or 
preponderately), 
but 
they 
represent 
the 
converted 
expression 
of 
impulses 
which 
in 
a 
broader 
sense 
might 
be 
designated 
as 
perverse 
if 
they 
could 
manifest 
themselves 
directly 
in 
phantasies 
andactswithoutdeviatingfromconsciousness. 
Thesymptomsare, 
therefore, 
partially 
formed 
at 
the 
cost 
of 
abnormal 
sexuality. 
The 
neurosis 
is, 
so 
to 
say, 
the 
negative 
of 
the 
perversion.

NEUROTIC 
SYMPTOMS—The 
symptoms 
of 
neuroses 
are 
exclusively, 
it 
might 
be 
said, 
either 
a 
substitutive 
satisfaction 
of 
some 
sexual 
impulse 
or 
measures 
to 
prevent 
such 
a 
satisfaction, 
and 
are 
as 
a 
rule 
compromises 
between 
the 
two, 
of 
the 
kind 
that 
arise 
according 
to 
the 
laws 
operating 
between

That 
a 
psychic 
process 
which 
develops 
anxiety 
may 
still 
be 
a 
wishfulfilment 
has 
long 
ceased 
to 
imply 
any 
contradiction 
for 
us. 
We 
may 
explain 
this 
occurrence 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
wish 
belongs 
to 
one 
system 
(the 
Ucs.), 
whereas 
the 
other 
system 
(the 
Pcs.) 
has 
rejected 
and 
suppressed 
it. 
The 
subjection 
of 
the 
Ucs. 
by 
the 
Pcs. 
is 
not 
thoroughgoing 
even 
in 
perfect 
psychic 
health; 
the 
extent 
of 
this 
suppression 
indicates 
the 
degree 
of 
our 
psychic 
normality. 
Neurotic 
symptoms 
indicate 
to 
us 
that 
the 
two 
systems 
are 
in 
mutual 
conflict; 
the 
symptoms 
are 
the 
result 
of 
a 
compromise 
in 
this 
conflict, 
and 
they 
temporarily 
put 
an 
end 
to 
it. 
On 
the 
one 
hand 
they 
afford 
the 
Ucs. 
a 
way 
out 
for 
the 
discharge 
of 
its 
excitation—they 
serve 
it 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
sally-gate—while, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
they 
give 
the 
Pcs. 
the 
possibility 
of 
dominatingthe 
Ucs. 
in 
some 
degree. 
It 
is 
instructive 
to 
consider, 
for 
example, 
the 
significance 
of 
a 
hysterical 
phobia, 
or 
of 
agoraphobia. 
A 
neurotic 
is 
said 
to 
be 
incapable 
of 
crossing 
the 
street 
alone, 
and 
this 
we 
should 
rightly 
call 
a 
“symptom.” 
Let 
someone 
now 
remove 
this 
symptom 
by 
constraining 
him 
to 
this 
action 
which 
he 
deems 
himself 
incapable 
of 
performing. 
The 
result 
will 
be 
anattack 
of 
anxiety, 
just 
asan 
attack 
of 
anxiety 
in 
the 
streethasoften 
been 
the 
exciting 
cause 
of 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
agoraphobia. 
We 
thus 
learn 
that 
the 
symptom 
has 
been 
constituted 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
the 
anxiety 
from 
breaking 
out. 
The 
phobia 
is 
thrown 
up 
before 
the 
anxiety 
like 
a 
frontier 
fortress.

What 
features 
are 
common 
to 
all 
neurotic 
symptoms? 
Here 
we 
may 
note 
two 
important 
points. 
The 
effects 
of 
the 
trauma 
are 
twofold, 
positive 
and 
negative. 
The 
former 
are 
endeavours 
to 
revive 
the 
trauma, 
to 
remember 
the 



forgotten 
experience, 
or, 
better 
still, 
to 
make 
it 
real—to 
live 
through 
once 
more 
a 
repetition 
of 
it; 
if 
it 
was 
an 
early 
affective 
relationship 
it 
is 
revived 
in 
an 
analogous 
connection 
with 
another 
person. 
These 
endeavours 
are 
summed 
up 
in 
the 
terms 
“fixation 
to 
the 
trauma” 
and 
“repetition-compulsion.” 
The 
effects 
can 
be 
incorporated 
into 
the 
so-called 
normal 
Ego 
and 
in 
the 
form 
of 
constant 
tendencies 
lend 
to 
it 
immutable 
character 
traits, 
although—or 
rather 
because—their 
real 
cause, 
their 
historical 
origin, 
has 
been 
forgotten. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
negative 
reactions 
pursue 
the 
opposite 
aim; 
here 
nothing 
is 
to 
be 
remembered 
or 
repeated 
of 
the 
forgotten 
traumata. 
They 
may 
be 
grouped 
together 
as 
defensive 
reactions. 
They 
express 
themselves 
in 
avoiding 
issues, 
a 
tendency 
which 
may 
culminate 
in 
an 
inhibition 
or 
phobia. 
These 
negative 
reactions 
also 
contribute 
considerably 
to 
the 
formation 
of 
character. 
Actually 
they 
represent 
fixations 
on 
the 
trauma 
no 
less 
than 
do 
the 
positive 
reactions, 
but 
they 
follow 
the 
opposite 
tendency. 
The 
symptoms 
of 
the 
neurosis 
proper 
constitute 
a 
compromise, 
to 
which 
both 
the 
positive 
and 
negative 
effects 
of 
the 
trauma 
contribute; 
sometimes 
one 
component, 
sometimes 
the 
other, 
predominates. 
These 
opposite 
reactions 
create 
conflicts 
which 
the 
subject 
cannotas 
aruleresolve.

NEUROTICS—There 
is 
a 
class 
of 
psychological 
patients 
who 
evidently 
resemble 
the 
psychotics 
very 
closely, 
the 
immense 
number 
of 
sufferers 
from 
severe

The

as

as 
the

mechanisms 
of 
their 
illness 
must 
be 
the 
same 
or 
at 
least 
very 
similar. 
Their 
ego, 
however, 
has 
proved 
more 
resistant 
and 
has 
become 
less 
disorganized. 
Many 
of 
them,

no

that 
persons

have 
not

It 
is 
very 
important 
for 
mental 
health 
that 
the 
Super-Ego 
should 
develop 
normally—that 
is, 
that 
it 
should 
become 
sufficiently 
depersonalized. 
It 
is 
precisely 
this 
that 
does 
not 
happen 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
neurotic, 
because 
his 
OEdipus 
complex 
does 
not 
undergo 
the 
right 
transformation. 
His 
Super-Ego 
deals 
with 
his 
Ego 
like 
a 
strict 
father 
with 
a 
child, 
and 
his 
idea 
of 
morality 
displays 
itself

submit

is

myth 
of 
King 
OEdipus,

killed 
his

married

That 
he 
did 
so 
unknowingly,

Oedipus 
Complex 
in 
Women—With 
the 
transference 
of 
the 
child-penis 
wish 
ontoher 
father, 
thegirlenters 
into 
the 
situation 
of 
theOEdipus-complex. 
The 
hostility 
against 
her 
mother, 
which 
did 
not 
require 
to 
be 
newly 
created, 



now 
receives 
a 
great 
reinforcement, 
for 
her 
mother 
becomes 
a 
rival, 
who 
gets 
everything 
from 
her 
father 
that 
she 
herself 
wants. 
The 
girl’s 
OEdipus-complex 
has 
long 
concealed 
from 
us 
the 
pre-oedipal 
attachment 
to 
her 
mother 
which 
is 
so 
important 
and 
which 
leaves 
behind 
it 
such 
lasting 
fixations. 
For 
the 
girl, 
the 
OEdipus 
situation 
is 
the 
conclusion 
of 
a 
long 
and 
difficult 
period 
of 
development, 
it 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
temporary 
solution 
of 
her 
problem, 
a 
state 
of 
equilibrium 
which 
is 
not 
lightly 
to 
be 
given 
up, 
especially 
as 
the 
onset 
of 
the 
latency 
period 
is 
not 
far 
off. 
And 
here 
we 
notice 
a 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
sexes 
in 
the 
relation 
between 
the 
OEdipus-complex 
and 
the 
castration-
complex, 
a 
difference 
which 
is 
probably 
a 
momentous 
one. 
The 
boy’s 
OEdipus-complex, 
in 
which 
he 
desires 
his 
mother, 
and 
wants 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
his 
father 
as 
a 
rival, 
develops 
naturally 
out 
of 
the 
phase 
of 
phallic 
sexuality. 
The 
threat 
of 
castration, 
however, 
forces 
him 
to 
give 
up 
this 
attitude. 
Under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
danger 
of 
losing 
his 
penis, 
he 
abandons 
his 
OEdipus-complex; 
it 
is 
repressed 
and 
in 
the 
most 
normal 
cases 
entirely 
destroyed, 
while 
a 
severe 
super-ego 
is 
set 
up 
as 
its 
heir. 
What 
happens 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
girl 
is 
almost 
the 
opposite. 
The 
castration-complex 
prepares 
the 
way 
for 
the 
OEdipuscomplex 
instead 
of 
destroying 
it; 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
her 
penis-envy 
the 
girl 
is 
driven 
from 
her 
attachment 
to 
her 
mother, 
and 
enters 
the 
OEdipus 
situation, 
as 
though 
it 
were 
a 
haven 
of 
refuge. 
When 
the 
fear 
of 
castration 
disappears, 
the 
primary 
motive 
is 
removed, 
which 
has 
forced 
the 
boy 
to 
overcome 
his 
OEdipus-complex. 
The 
girl 
remains 
in 
the 
OEdipus 
situation 
for 
an 
indefinite 
period, 
she 
only 
abandons 
it 
late 
in 
life, 
and 
then 
incompletely.

of

of

perception 
either 
of 
the 
urge

of 
something 
in

Pain, 
Physical—Pain—primarily 
and 
as 
a 
rule—occurs 
if 
a 
stimulus 
impinging 
on 
the 
periphery 
breaks 
through 
the 
defenses 
that 
oppose 
stimuli 
of 
excessive 
strength 
and 
hence 
acts 
like 
a 
continuous 
instinctual 
stimulus 
against 
which 
otherwise 
efficacious 
muscular 
activity 
such 
as 
serves 
to 
remove 
the 
stimulated 
region 
from 
the 
stimulus 
remains 
powerless. 
If 
the 
pain 
does 
not 
originate 
from 
a 
point 
on 
the 
skin 
but 
from 
an 
internal 
organ, 
this 
does 
not 
alter 
the 
situation 
in 
any 
way; 
it

striking 
characteristic 
of 
symptom-
formation 
in

is 
the 
process 
which 
deserves 
the 
name 
of

An 
internal 
perception 
is 
suppressed, 
and, 
instead, 
its 
content, 
after 
undergoing 
a 
certain 
degree 
of 
distortion, 
enters 
consciousness

the 
form

Paranoia, 
Persecutory—In 
persecutory 
paranoia 
the

defending 
himself 
against 
an 
unduly 
strong 
homosexual 
attachment 
to 
a 
given 
person, 
with 
the 
result 
that 
the 
person 
he 
once 
loved 
most 
is 
changed 
into 
a 
persecutor 
and 
then 
becomes 
the 
object 
of 
aggressive 
and 
often 
dangerous 
impulses 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
patient. 
Here 
we 
have 
grounds 
for 
interposing 
an

Patients

term

display 
two

They

they

The

does 
not 
remain 
attached 
to 
objects 
in 
phantasy, 
but 
returns 
to 
the 
ego; 
the 
megalomania 
then 
represents 
the 
mastery 
of 
this 
volume 
of 
libido, 
and 
thus 
corresponds 
with 
the 
introversion 
on 
to 
the 
phantasy-creations 
that 
is 
found 
in 
the 
transference

the 
hypochondria 
of 
paraphrenia, 
which 
is 
homologous 
to 
the 
anxiety

Parents 
as 
Love-Objects—The

of 
the

is 
his 
mother, 
and 
she 
remains 
as 
such 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
his 
OEdipus-complex, 
and, 
ultimately, 
throughout 
his 
whole 
life. 
For 
the 
little 
girl, 
too, 
her 
mother 
must 
be 
her 
first 
object 
(together 
with 
figures 
of 
nurses 
and 
other 
attendants 
that 
merge 
into 
hers); 
the

in

course 
of 
development, 
she 
should 
find 
her 
way 
to 
her 
ultimate 
object-choice. 
The

has,

in

of

to 
change 
both 
her 
erotogenic

of 
them

Father-Fixation 
(in 
Women)—We 
have 
made 
the 
most 
surprising 
discoveries 
about 
these 
women 
who 
display 
intense 
and 
prolonged 
father-
fixations. 
We 
knew, 
of 
course, 
that 
there 
had 
been 
an 
earlier 
stage 
in 
which 
they 
were 
attached 
to 
their 
mother; 
but 
we 
did 
not 
know 
that 
it 
was 
so 
rich 
in 
content, 
that 
it 
persisted 
so 
long, 
and 
that 
it 
could 
leave 
behind 
it 
so 
many 
occasionsforfixationsandpredispositions. 
During 
thistime,theirfather 
isno 
more 
than 
an 
irksome 
rival. 
In 
many 
cases 
the 
attachment 
to 
the 
mother 
lasts 
beyond 
the 
fourth 
year; 
almost 
everything 
that 
we 
find 
later 
in 
the 
father-
relation 
was 
already 
present 
in 
that 
attachment, 
and 
has 
been 
subsequently 
transferred 
on 
to 
the 
father. 
In 
short, 
we 
gain 
the 
conviction 
that 
one 
cannot 
understand 
women, 
unless 
one 
estimates 
this 
pre-oedipal 
attachment 
to 
the 
mother 
at

MOTHER—A 
child’s 
first 
erotic 
object 
is 
the 
mother’s 
breast 
that 
feeds 
him, 
and 
love 
in 
its 
beginnings 
attaches 
itself 
to 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
the 
need 
for 
food. 
To 
start 
with, 
the 
child 
certainly 
makes 
no 
distinction 
between 
the 
breast 
and 
his 
own 
body; 
when 
the 
breast 
has 
to 
be 
separated 
from 
his 
body 
and 
shifted 
to 
the 
“outside” 
because 
he 
so 
often 
finds 
it 
absent, 
it 
carries 
with 
it, 
now 
that 
it 
is 
an 
“object,” 
part 
of 
the 
original 
narcissistic 
cathexis. 
This 
first 
object 
subsequently 
becomes 
completed 
into 
the 
whole 
person 
of 
the 
child’s 
mother, 
who 
not 
only 
feeds 
him 
but 
also 
looks 
after 
him 
and 
thus 
arouses 
in 
him 
many 
other 
physical 
sensations 
pleasant 
and 
unpleasant. 
By 



her 
care 
of 
the 
child’s 
body 
she 
becomes 
his 
first 
seducer. 
In 
these 
two 
relations 
lies 
the 
root 
of 
a 
mother’s 
importance, 
unique, 
without 
parallel, 
laid 
down 
unalterably 
for 
a 
whole 
lifetime, 
as 
the 
first 
and 
strongest 
love-object 
and 
as 
the 
prototype 
of 
all 
later 
love 
relations—for 
both 
sexes. 
The 
phylogenetic 
foundation 
has 
so 
much 
the 
upper 
hand 
in 
all 
this 
over 
accidental 
personalexperience 
thatitmakesnodifferencewhether 
achildhas 
really

at

or 
has 
been 
brought 
up 
on 
the 
bottle 
and 
never 
enjoyed 
the 
tenderness 
of 
a 
mother’s 
care. 
His 
development 
takes 
the 
same 
path 
in 
both 
cases; 
it 
may 
be 
that 
in 
the 
latter 
event 
his 
later 
longing 
is 
all 
the 
greater. 
And 
for 
however 
long 
a 
child 
is 
fed 
at 
his 
mother’s 
breast, 
he 
will 
always 
be 
left 
with 
a 
conviction 
after 
he 
is 
weaned 
that

Phallic

us 
that 
the

a 
short

we

therefore 
not 
find 
improbable 
what 
the

asserts 
concerning 
the

give

an

This 
step 
in 
development 
is 
not 
merely 
a 
question 
of 
a 
change

The 
turning 
away

occurs 
in 
an 
atmosphere 
of 
antagonism; 
the 
attachment 
to 
the

ends 
in 
hate. 
Such 
a 
hatred 
may 
be 
very 
marked 
and 
may 
persist 
throughout 
an 
entire 
lifetime; 
it 
may 
later 
on 
be 
carefully 
overcompensated; 
as 
a 
rule, 
one 
part 
of 
it

If 
we 
penetrate 
deeply 
into 
the 
neuroses 
of 
women, 
we 
not 
infrequently 
meet 
with 
the 
repressed 
wish 
to 
possess 
a 
penis. 
We 
call 
this 
infantile 
wish 
“penis-envy” 
andincludeitwithinthecastrationcomplex. 
... 


TIAE 


We 
ascribe 
a 
castration-complex 
to 
the 
female 
sex 
as 
well 
as 
to 
the 
male. 
That 
complex 
has 
not 
the 
same 
content 
in 
girls 
as 
in 
boys. 
The 
castration-
complex 
in 
the 
girl, 
as 
well, 
is 
started 
by 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
genital 
organs 
of 
the 
other 
sex. 
She 
immediately 
notices 
the 
difference, 
and—it 
must 
be 
admitted 
—its 
significance. 
She 
feels 
herself 
at 
a 
great 
disadvantage, 
and 
often 
declares 
that 
she 
would 
“like 
to 
have 
something 
like 
that 
too,” 
and 
falls 
a 
victim 
to 
penis-envy, 
which 
leaves 
ineradicable 
traces 
on 
her 
development 
and 
character-formation, 
and, 
even 
in 
the 
most 
favorable 
instances, 
is 
not 



overcome 
without 
a 
great 
expenditure 
of 
mental 
energy. 
That 
the 
girl 
recognizes 
the 
fact 
that 
she 
lacks 
a 
penis, 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
she 
accepts 
its 
absence 
lightly. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
she 
clings 
for 
a 
long 
time 
to 
the 
desire 
to 
get 
something 
like 
it, 
and 
believes 
in 
that 
possibility 
for 
an 
extraordinary 
number 
of 
years; 
and 
even 
at 
a 
time 
when 
her 
knowledge 
of 
reality 
has 
long 
since 
led 
her 
to 
abandon 
the 
fulfilment 
of 
this 
desire 
as 
being 
quite 
unattainable, 
analysis 
proves 
that 
it 
still 
persists 
in 
the 
unconscious, 
and 
retains 
a 
considerable 
charge 
of 
energy. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
discovery 
of 
her 
castration 
is 
a 
turning-point 
in 
the 
life 
of 
the 
girl. 
Three 
lines 
of 
development 
diverge 
from 
it; 
one 
leads 
to 
sexual 
inhibition 
or 
to 
neurosis, 
the 
second 
to 
a 
modification 
of 
character 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
masculinity 
complex, 
and 
the 
third 
to 
normal 
femininity. 
. 
. 
. 
At 
first 
the 
girl 
looks 
on 
her 
castration 
as 
a 
personal 
misfortune, 
and 
only 
gradually 
extends 
it 
to 
other 
females, 
and 
eventually 
to 
hermother.

Child-Penis-Wish—The

no

ultimately 
the 
wish 
for 
the 
penis, 
which 
her 
mother 
has 
refused 
her 
and 
which 
she 
now 
expects 
from 
her

The 
feminine 
situation 
is,

merely 
the 
substituting

of 
early 
childhood 
deserve 
mention 
once 
again. 
Certain 
of 
them—the 
fear 
of 
being 
alone, 
of 
the 
dark, 
of 
strangers—we 
can 
understand 
as 
reactions 
to 
the 
danger 
of 
object 
loss; 
with 
regard 
to 
others—fear 
of 
small 
animals, 
thunderstorms, 
etc.—there 
is 
the 
possibility 
that 
they 
represent 
the 
atrophied 
remnants 
of 
an 
innate 
preparedness 
against 
reality 
dangers 
such 
as 
is 
so 
well 
developed 
in 
other 
animals. 
It 
is 
the 
part 
of 
this 
archaic 
heritage 
having 
to 
do 
with 
object 
loss 
which 
alone 
has 
utility 
for 
man. 
If 
such 
childhood 
phobias 
become 
fixed, 
grow 
more 
intense, 
and 
persist 
into 
a 
later 
period 
of 
life, 
analysis 
demonstrates 
that 
their 
content 
has 
become 
connected 
with 
instinctual 
demands, 
has 
becometherepresentativeof

PLEASURE 
PRINCIPLE 
(PLEASURE-PAIN 
PRINCIPLE)—In 
the 



psycho-analytical 
theory 
of 
the 
mind 
we 
take 
it 
for 
granted 
that 
the 
course 
of 
mental 
processes 
is 
automatically 
regulated 
by 
“the 
pleasure-principle”: 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
we 
believe 
that 
any 
given 
process 
originates 
in 
an 
unpleasant 
state 
of 
tension 
and 
thereupon 
determines 
for 
itself 
such 
a 
path 
that 
its 
ultimate 
issue 
coincides 
with 
a 
relaxation 
of 
this 
tension, 
i.e. 
with 
avoidance 
of 
“pain” 
orwith 
productionof 
pleasure. 


BPP—ch.

The 
pleasure-principle 
is 
a 
tendency 
which 
subserves 
a 
certain 
function— 
namely, 
that 
of 
rendering 
the 
psychic 
apparatus 
as 
a 
whole 
free 
from 
any 
excitation,ortokeeptheamountofexcitationconstantoras

The 
pleasure-pain 
principle 
is 
brought 
into 
action 
in 
response 
to 
the 
danger-signal, 
and 
plays 
a 
part 
in 
repression.

From

do 
not

it

PRE-GENITALPHASES—We 
will 
call 
the 
organizations 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
in 
which 
the 
genital 
zones 
have 
not 
yet 
assumed 
the 
dominating 
role, 
the 
pregenital 
phase. 


One 
of 
the 
first 
of 
such 
pregenital 
sexual 
organizations 
is 
the 
oral, 
or 
if 
one 
will, 
the 
cannibalistic. 
Here 
the 
sexual 
activity 
is 
not 
yet 
separated 
from 
the 
taking 
of 
nourishment 
and 
the 
contrasts 
within 
it 
are 
not 
yet 
differentiated. 
The 
object 
of 
the 
one 
activity 
is 
also 
that 
of 
the 
other; 
the 
sexual 
aim 
then 
consists 
in 
the 
incorporation 
of 
the 
object 
into 
one’s 
own 
body, 
the 
prototype 
of 
identification, 
which 
later 
plays 
such 
an 
important 
psychic 
rôle. 
As 
a 
remnant 
of 
this 
fictitious 
phase 
of 
organization 
forced 
on 
us 
by 
pathology, 
we 
can 
consider 
thumbsucking. 
Here 
the 
sexual 
activity 
became 
separated 
from 
the 
nourishment 
activity 
and 
the 
strange 
object 
was 
givenupin 
favorofone 
from 
his 
ownbody. 


A 
second 
pregenital 
phase 
is 
the 
sadistic-anal 
organization. 
Here 
the 
contrasts 
which 
run 
through 
the 
whole 
sexual 
life 
are 
already 
developed, 
but 
cannot 
yet 
be 
designated 
as 
masculine 
and 
feminine, 
but 
must 
be 
called 
active 
and 
passive.

in 
the

achieves 
an 
importance 
which 
can 
no 
longer 
be

We 
have 
reserved 
the 
name 
of 
genital 
phase 
for 
the 
final 
sexual 
organization, 
established 
after 
puberty,

Certain 
inadequacies 
of 
our 
psychic 
functions 
and 
certain 
performances 
which 
are 
apparently 
unintentional 
prove 
to 
be 
well 
motivated 
when 
subjected 
to 
psychoanalytic 
investigation, 
and 
are 
determined 
through 
the 
consciousness 
of 
unknown 
motives. 


In 
order 
to 
belong 
to 
the 
class 
of 
phenomena 
which 
can 
thus 
be 
explained, 
a 
faultypsychicactionmustsatisfy 
thefollowing 
conditions: 


(a) 
It 
must 
not 
exceed 
a 
certain 
measure, 
which 
is 
firmly 
established 
through 
our 
estimation, 
and 
is 
designated 
by 
the 
expression 
“within 
normal 
limits.” 
(b) 
It 
must 
evince 
the 
character 
of 
the 
momentary 
and 
temporary 
disturbance. 
The 
same 
action 
must 
have 
been 
previously 
performed 
more 
correctly 
or 
we 
must 
always 
rely 
on 
ourselves 
to 
perform 
it 
more 
correctly; 
if 
we 
are 
corrected 
by 
others, 
we 
must 
immediately 
recognize 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
correction 
andtheincorrectness 
ofourpsychicaction. 
(c) 
If 
we 
at 
all 
perceive 
a 
faulty 
action, 
we 
must 
not 
perceive 
in 
ourselves 
any 
motivation 
of 
the 
same, 
but 
must 
attempt 
to 
explain 
it 
through 
“inattention” 
orattributeittoan 
“accident.” 
Thus, 
there 
remain 
in 
this 
group 
the 
cases 
of 
forgetting, 
the 
errors, 
the

in

Psychoanalysis 
as 
a 
Therapeutic 
Method—One 
of 
the 
first 
applications 
of 
psychoanalysis 
was 
that 
we 
were 
able 
to 
understand 
the 
opposition 
we 
had 
to 
meet 
on 
account 
of 
our 
psychoanalytic 
activities. 
. 
. 
. 
Psychoanalysis 
originated 
as 
a 
therapeutic 
procedure; 
it 
has 
gone 
far 
beyond 
that, 
but 
it 
has 
never 
given 
up 
its 
original 
field 
of 
work, 
and 
it 
still 
relies 
upon 
contact 
with 
clinical 
material 
for 
its 
further 
advances 
and 
development. 
The 
accumulation 
of 
empirical 
data 
upon 
which 
we 
base 
our 
theories 
can 
be 
obtained 
in 
no 
other 
way. 
. 
. 
. 
Psychoanalysis 
really 
is 
a 
form 
of 
therapy, 
just 
as 
other 
methods 
are. 
. 
. 
. 
As 
a 
psychotherapeutic 
method, 
analysis 
does 
not 
stand 
in 
opposition 
to 
other 
methods 
employed 
in 
this 
branch 
of 
medicine; 
it 
does 
not 
invalidate 
them 
nor 
does 
it 
exclude 
them. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
practice 
of 
psychoanalysis 
is 
difficult 
and 
exacting! 
. 
.

As 
a 
rule 
psychoanalysis 
either 
possesses 
the 
doctor 
entirely 
or 
not 
at 
all. 
. 
. 
. 
Compared 
with 
other 
psychotherapeutic 
procedures, 
psychoanalysis 
is 
far 
and 
away 
the 
most 
powerful. 
In 
suitable 
cases 
one 
can 
remove 
disturbances, 
and 
bring 
about 
alterations 
which 
could 
not 
be 
hoped 
for 
in 
preanalytic 
times. 
But 
it 
has 
also 
perfectly 
clearly 
felt

PSYCHOLOGY 


Psychology 
and 
Dreams—The 
psychology 
of 
the 
schools 
has 
never 
been 
able 
to 
say 
what 
dreams 
mean. 
It 
has 
not 
known 
what 
to 
do 
with 
them; 
if 
it 
tried 
to 
explain 
them, 
it 
had 
to 
become 
unpsychological, 
to 
fall 
back 
on 
sense-stimuli,unequal 
depth 
of 
sleep 
in 
thevarious 
parts 
of 
the 
brain, 
etc. 
But 
one 
may 
say 
that 
a 
psychology 
which 
cannot 
explain 
dreams 
is 
also 
useless 
for 
the 
elucidation 
of 
normal 
psychical 
activity,

be

what

mental 
is 



actually 
distinguished 
as 
such

the

being

that,

PSYCHOSIS—In

the

away 
from 
reality 
is 
brought 
about 
in

ways; 
either 
because 
the

is 
too 
strong, 
so 
that 
it

PUNISHMENT, 
UNCONSCIOUS 
NEED 
FOR—As 
to 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
unconscious 
need 
for 
punishment, 
there 
can 
be, 
I 
think, 
no 
doubt. 
It 
behaves 
like 
a 
part 
of 
the 
conscience, 
like 
the 
prolongation 
of 
conscience 
into 
the 
unconscious; 
and 
it 
must 
have 
the 
same 
origin 
as 
conscience, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
it 



will 
correspond 
to 
a 
piece 
of 
aggressiveness 
which 
has 
been 
internalized 
and 
taken 
over 
by 
the 
super-ego. 
If 
only 
the 
words 
were 
less 
incongruous, 
we 
should 
be 
justified, 
for 
all 
practical 
purposes, 
in 
calling 
it 
“an 
unconscious 
sense 
of 
guilt.” 
.

People 
in 
whom 
this 
unconscious 
sense 
of 
guilt 
is 
dominant, 
distinguish 
themselves 
under 
analytic 
treatment 
by 
exhibiting 
what 
is 
so 
unwelcome 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
prognosis—a 
negative

reaction.

In 
reflection 
there 
is 
a 
greater 
play 
of 
psychic 
activity 
than 
in 
the 
most 
attentive 
self-observation; 
this 
is

REGRESSION—As 
to 
the 
regression, 
we 
may 
further 
observe 
that 
it 
plays 
a 
no 
less 
important 
part 
in 
the 
theory 
of 
neurotic 
symptom-formation 
than 
in 



the 
theory 
of 
dreams. 
We 
may 
therefore 
distinguish 
a 
threefold 
species 
of 
regression:(a)a 
topical 
one, 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
scheme 
of 
the 
ψ-systems 
here 
expounded;(b)a 
temporal 
one, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
a 
regression 
to 
older 
psychic 
formations; 
and 
(c)a 
formal 
one, 
when 
primitive 
modes 
of 
expression 
and 
representation 
take 
the 
place 
of 
the 
customary 
modes. 
These 
three 
forms 
of 
regression 
are, 
however, 
basically 
one,

in 
the 
majority 
of 
cases 
they 
coincide,

such 
as

Regression, 
Temporal—When

them 
occasion 
to 
comment 
upon 
a 
so-called 
temporal 
regression, 
i.e. 
the 
particular 
extent 
to 
which 
each 
of 
them 
retraces 
the 
stages 
of 
its 
evolution. 
We 
distinguish 
two 
such 
regressions—one 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
ego 
and 
the 
other 
in 
that 
of 
the 
libido. 
In

the 
latter 
is

to 
me 
incontrovertible,

since 
this 
feeling 
is 
not 
simply 
carried 
on 
from 
childhood 
days

is 
kept 
alive 
perpetually 
by 
the 
fear

as 
a 
result 
of 
biological

psychological 
necessities. 
But 
it 
cannot 
achieve

RENUNCIATION, 
INSTINCTUAL—When 
the 
Id 
makes 
an 
instinctual 
demand 
of 
an 
erotic 
or 
aggressive 
nature 
on 
a 
human 
being, 
the 
most 
simple 
and 
natural 
response 
for 
the 
Ego, 
which 
governs 
the 
apparatus 
for 
thinking 



and 
muscle 
innervation, 
is 
to 
satisfy 
this 
by 
an 
action. 
This 
satisfaction 
of 
the 
instinct 
is 
felt 
as 
pleasure 
by 
the 
Ego, 
just 
as 
not 
satisfying 
this 
instinct 
would 
undoubtedly 
become 
a 
source 
of 
discomfort. 
Now, 
it 
may 
happen 
that 
the 
Ego 
eschews 
satisfaction 
of 
the 
instinct 
because 
of 
external 
obstacles— 
namely, 
when 
it 
realizes 
that 
the 
action 
in 
question 
would 
bring 
in 
its 
course 
serious 
danger 
to 
the 
Ego. 
Such 
a 
refraining 
from 
satisfaction, 
an 
“instinctual 
renunciation” 
because 
of 
external 
obstacles—as 
we 
say, 
in 
obedience 
to 
the 
reality-principle—is 
never 
pleasurable. 
The 
instinctual 
renunciation 
would 
bring 
about 
a 
lasting 
painful 
tension 
if 
we 
did 
not 
succeed 
in 
diminishing 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
instinctual 
urge 
itself 
through 
a 
displacement 
of 
energy. 
This 
instinctual 
renunciation 
may 
also 
be 
forced 
on 
us, 
however, 
by 
other 
motives, 
which 
we 
rightly 
call 
inner 
ones. 
In 
the 
course 
of 
individual 
development 
a 
part 
of 
the 
inhibiting 
forces 
in 
the 
outer 
world 
becomes 
internalized; 
a 
standard 
is 
created 
in 
the 
Ego 
which 
opposes 
the 
other 
faculties 
by 
observation, 
criticism, 
and 
prohibition. 
We 
call 
this 
new 
standard 
the 
Superego. 
. 
. 
. 
While, 
however, 
instinctual 
renunciation 
for 
external 
reasons 
is 
only 
painful, 
renunciation 
for 
internal 
reasons, 
in 
obedience 
to 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
Super-ego, 
has 
another 
economic 
effect. 
It 
brings 
besides 
the 
inevitable 
pain 
a 
gainin

inherent

principle 
powerful 
enough 
to 
overrule 
the

lending 
to 
certain

their

Repressed, 
Emergence 
into 
Consciousness 
of 
the—The 
repressed 
material 
retains 
its 
impetus 
to 
penetrate 
into 
consciousness. 
It 
reaches 
its 
aim 
when 
three 
conditions 
are 
present: 
(1) 
When 
the 
strength 
of 
counter-cathexis 
is 
diminished 
by 
an 
illness 
which 
acts 
on 
the 
Ego 
itself, 
or 
through 
a 
different 
distribution 
of 
cathexis 
in 
the 
Ego, 
as 
happens 
regularly 
during 
sleep. 
(2) 
When 
those 
instincts 
attached 
to 
the 
repressed 
material 
become 
strengthened. 
The 
processes 
during 
puberty 
provide 
the 
best 
example 
for 
this. 
(3) 
Whenever 
recent 
events 
produce 
impressions 
or 
experiences 
which 
are 
so 
much 
like 
the 
repressed 
material 
that 
they 
have 
the 
power 
to 
awaken 
it. 
Thus 
the 
recent 
material 
gets 
strengthened 
by 
the 
latent 
energy 
of 
the 
repressed 
and 
the 
repressed 
material

The 
Ego 
feels 
a 
demand 
from 
an 
instinct 
which 
it 
wishes 
to 
withstand, 
because 
it 
suspects 
that 
satisfaction 
is 
dangerous, 
would 
evoke 
a 
traumatic 
situation, 
a 
collision 
with 
the 
outer 
world; 
but 
it 
cannot 
master 
it, 
because 
it 
has 
not 
yet 
the 
strength 
necessary. 
The 
Ego 
then 
treats 
the 
risk 
from 
the 
instinct 
as 
though 
it 
were 
an 
outside 
danger, 
and 
makes 
an 
attempt 
at 
flight; 
it 
withdraws 
from 
that 
part 
of 
the 
Id, 
leaving 
it 
to 
its 
fate, 
after 
having 
refused 
it 
all 
the 
help 
which 
it 
normally 
affords 
to 
instinctual 
impulses. 
We 
put 
it, 
that 
Ego 
undertakes 
a 
repression 
of 
these 
instinctual 
impulses. 
By 
the 
act 
of 
repression 
the 
Ego 
follows 
the 
pleasure 
principle, 
which 
otherwise 
it 
is 
wont 
to 
correct, 
and 
it 
suffers 
harm 
on 
this 
account. 
The 
harm 
consists 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Ego 
has 
now 
imposed 
a 
lasting 
limitation 
on 
its 
sphere 
of 
power. 
The 
repressed 
instinctual 
impulse 
is 
henceforth 
isolated; 
it 
is 
left 
to 
itself 
and 
inaccessible,butthis 
meansthatitcannotbeinfluenced. 
Itgoes

Repression 
proceeds 
from 
the 
ego, 
which, 
possibly 
at 
the 
command 
of 
the 
superego, 
does 
not 
wish 
to 
be 
a 
party 
to 
an 
instinct 
cathexis 
originating 
in 
the 
id. 
Through 
repression 
the 
ego 
accomplishes 
the 
exclusion 
from 
consciousness 
of 
the 
idea 
which 
was 
the 
carrier 
of 
the 
unwelcome 
impulse. 
Analysis 
frequently 
demonstrates 
that 
the 
idea 
has 
been 
retained 
as 
an

It 
is 
an

which 
takes 
place 
on 
a 
single 
occasion

is 
one 
demanding 
a 
continuous

therefore 
excludes 
the

the 
entrance 
into

as

the 
passage

The 
ego 
protects 
itself 
against 
the 
incursion 
of 
undesirable 
elements 
from 
the 
unconscious 
and 
repressed 
id 
by 
means 
of 
anti-cathexes, 
which 
must 
remain 
intact 
if 
it 
is 
to 
function 
normally. 
The 
more 
hardly 
the 
ego 
feels 
itself 
pressed, 
the 
more 
convulsively 
it 
clings 
(in 
terror, 
as 
it 
were) 
to 
these 
anticathexes, 
in 
order 
to 
protect 
what 
remains 
of 
it 
from 
further 
irruptions. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
ego 
shrinks 
from 
undertakings 
that 
seem 
dangerous 
and 
threaten 
unpleasure; 
it 
must 
be 
constantly 
spurred 
on 
and 
soothed 
down 
if 
it 
is 
not 
to 
fail 
us.

resistance,

persists

IN 
ANALYSIS—The

the 
perception 
of 
the 
resistance 
exerted 
by 
the 
patient 
when 
we 
try 
to 
make 
him 
conscious 
of 
his 
unconscious. 
The 
objective 
indication 
of 
resistance 
is 
that 
his 
associations 
stop 
short 
or 
wander 
far 
away 
from 
the 
theme 
that 
is 
being 
discussed. 
He 
may 
also 
become

resistance

We 
call 
all 
the 
forces 
which 
oppose 
the 
work 
of 
cure 
the 
patient’s 
“resistances.” 
The 
gain 
from 
the 
illness 
is 
the 
source 
of 
one 
resistance, 
and 
“unconscious 
guilt” 
represents 
the 
resistance 
from 
the 
Super-Ego; 
this 
is 
the 
most 
powerful 
factor, 
and 
the 
one 
we 
most 
fear. 
We 
meet 
still 
other 
resistances 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
treatment. 
If 
the 
Ego, 
in 
the 
early 
period, 
undertook 
a 
repression 
on 
account 
of 
anxiety, 
that 
anxiety 
still 
exists, 
and 
now 
expresses 
itself 
as 
a 
resistance 
if 
the 
Ego 
approaches 
what 
is 
repressed. 
It 
may 
well 
be 
imagined 
that 
difficulties 
arise 
when 
an 
instinctual 
process, 
which 
has 
followed 
a 
certain 
path 
perhaps 
for 
decades, 
is 
suddenly 
required 
to 
take 
a 
new 
course 
which 
has 
now 
opened 
for 
it. 
One 
might 
call 
that 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
Id. 
The 
fight 
against 
all 
these

sadism, 
can

readily

The 
sexuality 
of 
most 
men 
shows 
an 
admixture 
of 
aggression, 
of 
a 
desire 
to 
subdue, 
the 
biological 
significance 
of 
which 
lies 
in 
the 
necessity 
for 
overcoming 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
sexual 
object 
by 
actions 
other 
than 
mere 
courting. 
Sadism 
would 
then 
correspond 
to 
an 
aggressive 
component 
of 
the 
sexual 
instinct 
which

sexual 
motive 
powers 
to 
their 
professional 
or 
business 
activities. 
The 
sexual 
impulse 
is 
particularly 
suited 
to 
yield 
such 
contributions 
because 
it 
is 
endowed 
with 
the 
capacity 
of 
sublimation, 
i.e., 
it 
has 
the 
power 
to 
exchange 
its 
nearest 
aim 
for 
others 
of 
higher 
value 
which 
are 
not 
sexual. 
We 
consider 
this 
process 
as 
proved, 
if 
the 
history 
of 
childhood 
or 
the 
history 
of 
the 
psychic 
development 
of 
a 
person 
shows 
that 
in 
his 
childhood 
this 
powerful 
impulse 
was 
in 
the 
service 
of 
sexual 
interest. 
We 
consider 
it 
a 
further 
corroboration 
if 
the 
sexual 
life 
of 
mature 
years 
evinces 
a 
striking 
stunting, 
as 
if

manifests 
itself 
much

The 
child 
brings 
along 
into 
the

germs 
of 
sexual 
activity 
and 
even 
while 
taking 
nourishment, 
it 
at 
the 
same 
time 
also 
enjoys 
a 
sexual 
gratification 
which 
it 
then 
seeks 
again 
to 
procure 
for 
itself 
through 
the 
familiar 
activity 
of 
“thumb-sucking.” 
The 
sexual 
activity 
of 
the 
child, 
however, 
does 
not 
develop 
in 
the 
same 
measure 
as 
his 
other 
functions, 
but 



merges

the 
so-called

period 
from 
the 
age 
of 
three 
to 
the 
age 
of 
five 
years. 
The 
production 
of 
sexual 
excitation 
by 
no 
means 
ceases 
at 
this 
period 
but 
continues 
to 
furnish 
a 
stock 
of 
energy, 
the

of 
which 
is

(by

and

formation), 
for 
the 
erection 
of 
the 
future

barriers. 
Accordingly, 
the 
forces 
which 
are 
destined 
to 
hold 
the 
sexual 
instinct 
in 
certain 
tracks 
are 
built 
up 
in 
infancy 
with 
the 
help 
of 
education 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
perverse 
sexual 
feelings. 
Another 
part 
of 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
manifestations 
escapes 
this 
utilization 
and 
may 
manifest 
itself 
as 
sexual 
activity. 
It 
can 
then 
be 
discovered 
that 
the 
sexual 
excitation 
of 
the 
child 
flows 
from 
diverse 
sources. 
Above 
all, 
gratifications 
originate 
through 
the 
adapted 
sensible 
excitation 
of 
so-called 
erogenous 
zones. 
For 
these 
probably 
any 
skin 
region 
or 
sensory 
organ 
may 
serve; 
but 
there 
are 
certain 
distinguished 
erogenous 
zones, 
the 
excitation 
of 
which 
by 
certain 
organic 
mechanisms, 
is 
assured 
from 
fhe 
beginning. 
Moreover, 
sexual 
excitation 
originates 
in 
the 
organism, 
as 
it 
were, 
as 
a 
by-product 
in 
a 
greater 
number 
of 
processes, 
as 
soon 
as 
they 
attain 
a 
certain 
intensity; 
this 
especially 
takes 
place 
in 
all 
strong 
emotional 
excitements, 
even 
if 
they 
be 
of 
a 
painful 
nature. 
The 
excitations 
from 
all 
these 
sources 
do 
not 
yet 
unite, 
but 
they 
pursue 
their 
aim 
individually—this 
aim 
consisting

in

gaining 
of 
a 
certain

A 
child’s 
sexual 
life 
is 
naturally 
different 
from 
that 
of 
an 
adult. 
The 
sexual 
function 
undergoes 
a 
complicated 
development 
between 
its 
beginnings 
and 
the 
final 
form 
which 
we 
recognize 
as 
familiar. 
It 
grows 
together 
out 
of 
a 
number 
of 
component 
instincts 
with 
special 
aims, 
and 
passes 
through 
several 
phases 
of 
organization, 
until 
finally 
it 
is 
brought 
into 
the 
service 
of 
reproduction. 
The 
individual 
component-instincts 
are 
not 
all 
equally 
useful 
for 
the 
final 
purpose, 
and 
they 
must 
be 
diverted, 
remodelled, 
and 
in 
part 
suppressed. 
Such 
a 
far-reaching 
development 
is 
not 
always 
faultlessly 
carried 
out, 
and 
theremaybe 
inhibitions 
of

where, 
later, 
the 
exercise 
of 
the 
sexual

is 
met 
by 
hindrances, 
the 
sexual 
striving—the 
libido, 
as 
we 
say—reverts 
to 
such 
earlier 
points 
of 
fixation. 
The

The 
most 
remarkable 
feature—as 
it 
seems 
to 
me—in 
children’s 
sexual 
life 
is 
that 
it 
runs 
its 
whole 
far-reaching 
course 
in 
the 
first 
five 
years 
of 
life. 
From 
then 
on, 
until 
puberty, 
it 
goes 
through 
the 
so-called 
latency 
period, 
in 
which, 
normally, 
sexuality 
makes 
no 
progress; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
sexual 
strivings 
diminish 
in 
strength, 
and 
much 
that 
the 
child 
practiced 
or 
knew 
before 
is 
given 
up 
and 
forgotten. 
In 
this 
period, 
after 
the 
early 
blooming 
of 
sexual 
life 
has 
withered, 
are 
built 
up 
such 
attitudes 
of 
the 
Ego 
as 
shame, 
disgust, 
and 
morality, 
destined 
to 
stand 
against 
the 
later 
storms 
of 
puberty 
and 
to 
direct 
the 
paths 
of 
the 
freshly-awakened 
sexual 
desires.

A 
further 
characteristic 
of 
the 
sexuality 
of 
early 
childhood 
is 
that 
the 
female 
organ 
as 
yet 
plays 
no 
part 
in 
it—the 
child 
has 
not 
yet 
discovered 
it. 
All 
the 
accent 
falls 
on 
the

organ, 
and

psychoanalytic 
investigation 
. 
. 
. 
teaches 
us 
that 
many, 
perhaps 
most, 
children, 
at 
least 
the 
most 
gifted 
ones, 
go 
through 
a 
period 
beginning 
with 
the 
third 
year, 
which 
may 
be 
designated 
as 
the 
period 
of 
infantile 
sexual 
investigation. 
As 
far 
as 
we 
know, 
this 
curiosity 
is 
not 
awakened 
spontaneously 
in 
children 
of 
this 
age. 
It 
is 
aroused 
through 
the 
impression 
of 
an 
important 
experience, 
through 
the 
birth 
of 
a 
little 
brother 
or 
sister, 
or 
through 
fear 
of 
the 
same 
engendered 
by 
some 
outward 
experience, 
wherein 
the 
child 
sees 
a 
danger 
to 
his 
egotistic 
interests. 
The 
investigation 
directs 
itself 
to 
the 
question 
whence 
children 
come, 
as 
if 
the 
child 
were 
looking 
for 
means 
to 
guard 
against 
such 
an 
undesired 
event. 
. 
. 
. 
If 
the 
period 
of 
infantile 
sexual 
investigation 
comes 
to 
an 
end 
through 
an 
impetus 
of 
energetic 
sexual 
repression, 
the 
early 
association 
with 
sexual 
interest 
may 
result 
in 
three 
different 
possibilities 
for 
the 
future 
fate 
of 
the 
investigation 
impulse. 
The 
investigation 
either 
shares 
the 
fate 
of 
the 
sexuality; 
the 
curiosity 
henceforth 
remains 
inhibited 
and 
the 
free 
activity 
of 
intelligence 
may 
become 
narrowed 



for 
life. 
This 
is 
especially 
favored 
shortly 
thereafter 
by 
education 
and 
powerful 
religious 
inhibitions. 
This 
is 
the 
type 
of 
neurotic 
inhibition. 
. 
. 
. 
In 
a 
second 
type 
the 
intellectual 
development 
is 
sufficiently 
strong 
to 
withstand 
the 
sexual 
repression 
pulling 
at 
it. 
Sometimes, 
after 
the 
disappearance 
of 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
investigation, 
it 
offers 
its 
support 
to 
the 
old 
association 
in 
order 
to 
elude 
sexual 
repression, 
and 
the 
suppressed 
sexual 
investigation 
comes 
back 
from 
the 
unconscious 
as 
compulsive 
reasoning. 
It 
is 
naturally 
distorted 
and 
not 
free, 
but 
forceful 
enough 
to 
sexualize 
even 
thought 
itself 
and 
to 
accentuate 
the 
intellectual 
operations 
with 
the 
pleasure 
and 
anxiety 
of 
the 
actual 
sexual 
processes. 
Here 
the 
investigation 
becomes 
sexual 
activity 
and 
often 
exclusively 
so; 
the 
feeling 
of 
settling 
the 
problem 
and 
of 
explaining 
things 
in 
the 
mind 
is 
put 
in 
place 
of 
sexual 
gratification. 
But 
the 
indeterminate 
character 
of 
the 
infantile 
investigation 
repeats 
itself 
also 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
this 
reasoning 
never 
ends, 
and 
that 
the 
desired 
intellectual 
feeling 
of 
thesolutionconstantly 
recedesintothedistance. 


By 
virtue 
of 
a 
special 
disposition 
the 
third, 
which 
is 
the 
most 
rare 
and 
most 
perfect 
type, 
escapes 
the 
inhibition 
of 
thought 
and 
the 
compulsive 
reasoning. 
Also 
here 
sexual 
repression 
takes 
place, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
succeed 
in 
evincing 
a 
partial 
impulse 
of 
the 
sexual 
pleasure 
in 
the 
unconscious; 
instead 
the 
libido 
withdraws 
from 
the 
fate 
of 
the 
repression 
by 
being 
sublimated 
from 
the 
outset 
into 
curiosity, 
and 
by 
reinforcing 
the 
powerful 
investigation 
impulse.

What 
attitude 
ought 
we 
to 
take 
towards 
the 
sexual 
indulgence 
of 
early 
childhood? 
We 
have 
become 
aware 
of 
the 
responsibility 
we 
incur 
by 
suppressing 
it, 
andyet 
we 
cannot 
assumethatitisright 
to 
allow 
itunchecked. 
It 
appears 
that 
among 
races 
of 
low 
culture, 
and 
in 
the 
lower 
strata 
of 
civilized 
peoples, 
children’s 
sexuality 
is 
allowed 
free 
play. 
That 
probably 
constitutes 
a 
strong 
protection 
against 
later 
lapses 
into 
individual 
neurosis, 
but 
is 
there 
not 
at 
the

time 
great 
detriment 
to 
the

for 
cultural

Second 
Phase 
of 
Childhood 
Masturbation. 
Infantile 
masturbation 
seems 
to 
disappear 
after 
a 
brief 
time, 
but 
it 
may 
continue 
uninterruptedly 
till 
puberty 
and 
thus 
represent 
the 
first 
marked 
deviation 
from 
that 
development 
which 
is 
desirable 
for 
civilized 
man. 
At 
some 
time 
during 
childhood 
after 
the 
nursing 



period, 
the 
sexual 
instinct 
of 
the 
genitals 
re-awakens 
and 
continues 
active 
for 
some 
time 
until 
it 
is 
again 
suppressed, 
or 
it 
may 
continue 
without 
interruption.

Sexuality,Infantile—See 
Sexuality 
in 
Childhood. 


Sexuality 
in 
Puberty—With 
the 
beginning 
of 
puberty, 
changes 
set 
in, 
which 
transform 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
life 
into 
its 
definite 
normal 
form. 
Hitherto, 
the 
sexual 
instinct 
has 
been 
preponderantly 
autoerotic; 
it 
now 
finds 
the 
sexual 
object. 
Thus 
far, 
it 
has 
manifested 
itself 
in 
single 
impulses 
and 
in 
erogenous 
zones 
seeking 
a 
certain 
pleasure 
as 
a 
single 
sexual 
aim. 
A 
new 
sexual 
aim 
now 
appears 
for 
the 
production 
of 
which 
all 
partial 
impulses 
cooperate, 
while 
the 
erogenous 
zones 
subordinate 
themselves 
to 
the 
primacy 
of 
the 
genital 
zone. 
As 
thenewsexualaimassignsvery 
differentfunctionsto 
thetwosexes, 
their 
sexual 
developments 
now 
part 
company. 
The 
male 
sexual 
development 
is 
more 
consistent 
and 
easier 
to 
understand, 
while 
in 
the 
woman 
a 
sort 
of 
regression 
seems 
to 
appear. 
The 
normality 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
is 
guaranteed 
only 
by 
the 
exact 
concurrence 
of 
the 
two 
streams 
directed 
to 
the 
sexual 
object 
and 
sexualaim. 
It 
islike 
the 
piercingofatunnelfromopposite 
sides. 


The 
new 
sexual 
aim 
in 
the 
man 
consists 
in 
the 
discharge 
of 
the 
sexual 
products. 
This 
is 
not 
contradictory 
to 
the 
former 
sexual 
aim, 
which 
is 
that 
of 
obtaining 
pleasure; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
height 
of 
all 
pleasure 
is 
connected 
with 
this 
final 
act 
in 
the 
sexual 
process. 
The 
sexual 
instinct 
now 
enters 
into 
the 
service 
of 
the 
function 
of 
propagation; 
it 
becomes, 
so 
to 
say, 
altruistic. 
If 
this 
transformation 
is 
to 
succeed, 
its 
process 
must 
be 
adjusted 
to 
the 
original 
dispositionsandallthepeculiarities 
oftheimpulses.

Let 
us 
finally 
add 
that 
during 
the 
transition 
period 
of 
puberty 
the 
somatic 
and 
psychic 
processes 
of 
development 
proceed 
side 
by 
side, 
but 
separately, 
until, 
with 
the 
breaking 
through 
of 
an 
intense 
psychic 
love-stimulus 
for 
the 
innervation 
of 
the 
genitals, 
the 
normally 
demanded 
unification 
of 
the 
erotic 
function 
isestablished.

SHAME—The 
age 
of 
childhood, 
in 
which 
the 
sense 
of 
shame 
is 
unknown, 
seems 
a 
paradise 
when 
we 
look 
back 
upon 
it 
later, 
and 
paradise 
itself 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
mass-phantasy 
of 
the 
childhood 
of 
the 
individual. 
This 
is 
why 



in 
paradise 
men 
are 
naked 
and 
unashamed, 
until 
the 
moment 
arrives 
when 
shame 
and 
fear 
awaken; 
expulsion 
follows, 
and 
sexual 
life 
and 
cultural 
development 
begin. 
Into 
this 
paradise 
dreams 
can 
take 
us 
back 
every 
night; 
we 
have 
already 
ventured 
the 
conjecture 
that 
the 
impressions 
of 
our 
earliest 
childhood 
(from 
the 
prehistoric 
period 
until 
about 
the 
end 
of 
the 
third 
year) 
crave 
reproduction 
for 
their 
own 
sake, 
perhaps 
without 
further 
reference 
to 
their 
content, 
so 
that 
their 
repetition 
is 
a 
wish-fulfilment. 
Dreams 
of 
nakedness,then,are

The 
speech 
disturbance 
which 
manifests 
itself 
as 
a 
speech-blunder 
may, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
be 
caused 
by 
the 
influence 
of 
another 
component 
of 
the 
same 
speech; 
that 
is, 
through 
a 
fore-sound 
or 
an 
echo, 
or 
through 
another 
meaning 
within 
the 
sentence 
or 
context 
which 
differs 
from 
that 
which 
the 
speaker 
wishes 
to 
utter. 
In 
the 
second 
place, 
however, 
the 
disturbance 
could 
be 
brought 
about 
through 
influences 
outside 
this 
word, 
sentence

from 
elements 
which 
we 
did 
not 
intend 
to 
express, 
and 
of 
whose

we

only

both 
modes 
of 
origin 
of

in

the

When 
I 
set 
out 
the 
relationship 
of 
Ego 
and 
Id 
I 
kept 
back 
an 
important 
part 
of 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
psychical 
apparatus. 
It 
is 
this: 
we 
were 
forced 
to 
assumed 
that 
in 
the 
Ego 
itself 
a 
special 
agency 
has 
become 
differentiated, 
which 
we 
name 
the 
Super-Ego. 
This 
Super-Ego 
holds 
a 
special 
position 
between 
the 
Ego 
and 
the 
Id. 
It 
belongs 
to 
the 
Ego, 
shares 
its 
high 
psychological 
organization, 
but 
stands 
in 
an 
especially 
intimate 
connection 
with 
the 
Id. 
It 
is, 
actually, 
the 
precipitate 
of 
the 
Ego’s 
first 
attachments 
to 
objects; 
the 
heir 
of 
the 
OEdipus 
complex, 
when 
that 
has 
been 
vacated. 
This 
Super-Ego 
can 
set 
itself 
against 
the 
Ego. 
It 
can 
treat 
it 
as 
an 
object, 
and 
often 
uses 
it 
very 
harshly. 
It 
is 
just 
as 
important 
for 
the 
Ego 
to 
live 
in 
concord 
with 
the 
Super-
Ego 
as 
with 
the 
Id. 
Discords 
between 
Ego 
and 
Super-Ego 
have 
great 
significance 
for 
psychical 
Ufe. 
You 
will 
have 
guessed 
by 
now 
that 
the 
Super-
Ego 
is 
the 
vehicle 
for 
the 
phenomenon 
we 
call 
“conscience.” 
It 
is 
very 
important 
for 
mental 
health 
that 
the 
Super-Ego 
should 
develop 
normally— 
that 
is, 
that 
it 
should 
become 
sufficiently 
depersonalized. 
It 
is 
precisely 
this 
that 
does 
not 
happen 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
neurotic, 
because 
his 
OEdipus 
complex 
does

Superego

Relation 
to 
the

details 
of 
the 
relation 
between 
the

and 
the

become 
completely 
intelligible 
if 
they 
are 
carried 
back

SYSTEM—The 
secondary 
elaboration 
of 
the 
product 
of 
the 
dream-work 
is 
an 
excellent 
example 
of 
the 
nature 
and 
the 
pretensions 
of 
a 
system. 
An 
intellectual 
function 
in 
us 
demands 
the 
unification, 
coherence 
and 
comprehensibility 
of 
everything 
perceived 
and 
thought 
of, 
and 
does 
not 
hesitate 
to 
construct 
a 
false 
connection 
if, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
special 
circumstances, 
it 
cannot 
grasp 
the 
right 
one. 
We 
know 
such 
system 
formation 
not 
only 
from 
the 
dream, 
but 
also 
from 
phobias, 
from 
compulsive 
thinking 
and 
from 
the 
types 
of 
delusions. 
The 
system 
formation 
is 
most 
ingenious 
in 
delusional 
states 
(paranoia) 
and 
dominates 
the 
clinical 
picture, 
but 
it 
also 
must 
not 
be 
overlooked 
in 
other 
forms 
of 
neuropsychoses. 
In 
every 
case 
we 
can

violent, 
provided 
it

that

at

two 
motivations, 
one 
of 
which 
springs 
from 
the 
assumptions 
of 
the 
system 
and 
is 
therefore 
eventually 
delusional—and 
a 
hidden 
one 
which,

we

TABOO—Taboo 
is 
a 
Polynesian 
word, 
the 
translation 
of 
which 
provides 
difficulties 
for 
us 
because 
we 
no 
longer 
possess 
the 
idea 
which 
it 
connotes. 
It 
was 
still 
current 
with 
the 
ancient 
Romans: 
their 
word 
“sacer” 
was 
the 
same 
as 


the 
taboo 
of 
the 
Polynesians. 
The 
γoς 
of 
the 
Greeks 
and 
the 
Kodaush 
of 
the 
Hebrews 
must 
also 
have 
signified 
the 
same 
thing 
which 
the 
Polynesians 
express 
through 
their 
word 
taboo 
and 
what 
many 
races 
in 
America, 
Africa 
(Madagascar), 
North 
and 
Central 
Asia 
express 
through 
analogous 
designations. 


For 
us 
the 
meaning 
of 
taboo 
branches 
off 
into 
two 
opposite 
directions. 
On 
the 
one 
hand 
it 
means 
to 
us, 
sacred, 
consecrated: 
but 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
it 
means, 
uncanny, 
dangerous, 
forbidden, 
and 
unclean. 
The 
opposite 
for 
taboo 
is 
designated 
in 
Polynesian 
by 
the 
word 
noa 
and 
signifies 
something 
ordinary 
and 
generally 
accessible. 
Thus 
something 
like 
the 
concept 
of 
reserve 
inheres 
in 
taboo; 
taboo 
expresses 
itself 
essentially 
in 
prohibitions 
and 
restrictions. 
Our 
combinationof 
“holy 
dread” 
would 
often 
express 
the 
meaningoftaboo. 


T&T—ch. 
2 


Let 
us 
summarize 
what 
understanding 
we 
have 
gained 
of 
taboo 
through 
its 
comparison 
with 
the 
compulsive 
prohibition 
of 
the 
neurotic. 
Taboo 
is 
a 
very 
primitive 
prohibition 
imposed 
from 
without 
(by 
an 
authority) 
and 
directed 
against 
the 
strongest 
desires 
of 
man. 
The 
desire 
to 
violate 
it 
continues 
in 
the 
unconscious; 
persons 
who 
obey 
the 
taboo 
have 
an 
ambivalent 
feeling 
toward 
what 
is 
affected 
by 
the 
taboo. 
The 
magic 
power 
attributed 
to 
taboo 
goes 
back 
to 
its 
ability 
to 
lead 
man 
into 
temptation; 
it 
behaves 
like 
a 
contagion, 
because 
the 
example 
is 
contagious, 
and 
because 
the 
prohibited 
desire 
becomes 
displaced 
in 
the 
unconscious 
upon 
something 
else. 
The 
expiation 
for 
the 
violation 
of 
a 
taboo 
through 
a 
renunciation 
proves 
that 
a 
renunciation 
is 
at 
the 
basisof 
theobservanceofthetaboo.

Taboo 
and 
Compulsion 
Neurosis—He 
who 
approaches 
the 
problem 
of 



taboo 
from 
the 
field 
of 
psychoanalysis, 
which 
is 
concerned 
with 
the 
study 
of 
the 
unconscious 
part 
of 
the 
individual’s 
psychic 
life, 
needs 
but 
a 
moment’s 
reflection 
to 
realize 
that 
these 
phenomena 
are 
by 
no 
means 
foreign 
to 
him. 
He 
knows 
people 
who 
have 
individually 
created 
such 
taboo 
prohibitions 
for 
themselves, 
which 
they 
follow 
as 
strictly 
as 
savages 
observe 
the 
taboos 
common 
to 
their 
tribe 
or 
society. 
If 
he 
were 
not 
accustomed 
to 
call 
these 
individuals 
“compulsion 
neurotics” 
he 
would 
find 
the 
term 
“taboo 
disease” 
quite 
appropriate 
for 
their 
malady. 
Psychoanalytic 
investigation 
has 
taught 
him 
the 
clinical 
etiology 
and 
the 
essential 
part 
of 
the 
psychological 
mechanism 
of 
this 
compulsion 
disease, 
so 
that 
he 
cannot 
resist 
applying 
what 
he 
has 
learnt 
there 
to 
explain 
corresponding 
manifestations 
in 
folk 
psychology. 


There 
is 
one 
warning 
to 
which 
we 
shall 
have 
to 
give 
heed 
in 
making 
this 
attempt. 
The 
similarity 
between 
taboo 
and 
compulsion 
disease 
may 
be 
purely 
superficial, 
holding 
good 
only 
for 
the 
manifestations 
of 
both 
without 
extending 
into 
their 
deeper 
characteristics. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
first 
and 
most 
striking 
correspondence 
between 
the 
compulsion 
prohibitions 
of 
neurotics 
and 
taboo 
lies 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
origin 
of 
these 
prohibitions 
is 
just 
as 
unmotivated 
and 
enigmatic. 
They 
have 
appeared 
at 
some 
time 
or 
other 
and 
must 
now 
be 
retained 
on 
account 
of 
an 
unconquerable 
anxiety. 
An 
external 
threat 
of 
punishment 
is 
superfluous, 
because 
an 
inner 
certainty 
(a 
conscience) 
exists 
that 
violation 
will 
be 
followed 
by 
unbearable 
disaster. 
The 
very 
most 
that 
compulsion 
patients 
can 
tell 
us 
is 
the 
vague 
premonition 
that 
some 
person 
of 
their 
environment 
will 
suffer 
harm 
if 
they 
should 
violate 
the 
prohibition. 
Of 
what 
the 
harm 
is 
to 
consist 
is 
not 
known, 
and 
this 
inadequate 
information 
is 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
obtained 
during 
the 
later 
discussions 
of 
the 
expiatory 
and 
defensive 
actions 
than 
when 
the 
prohibitions 
themselves 
are 
being 
discussed. 
. 
. 
. 
Compulsion 
prohibitions, 
like 
taboo 
prohibitions, 
entail 
the 
most 
extraordinary 
renunciations 
and 
restrictions 
of 
life, 
but 
a 
part 
of 
these 
can 
be 
removed 
by 
carrying 
out 
certain 
acts 
which 
now 
also 
must 
be 
done 
because 
they 
have 
acquired 
a 
compulsive 
character 
(obsessive 
acts); 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
these 
acts 
are 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
penances, 
expiations, 
defence 
reactions, 
and 
purifications. 
The 
most 
common 
of 
these 
obsessive 
acts 
is 
washing 
with 
water 
(washing 
obsession). 
A 
part 
of 
the 
taboo 
prohibitions 
can 
also 
be 
replaced 
in 
this 
way, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
their 
violation 
can 
be 
made 
good 
through 
such 
a 
“ceremonial,” 
and 
here 
too 
lustration 
through 
water 
is 
the 
preferredway. 



Let 
us 
now 
summarize 
the 
points 
in 
which 
the 
correspondence 
between 
taboo 
customs 
and 
the 
symptoms 
of 
compulsion 
neurosis 
are 
most 
clearly 
manifested: 
1. 
In 
the 
lack 
of 
motivation 
of 
the 
commandments, 
2. 
in 
their 
enforcement 
through 
an 
inner 
need, 
3. 
in 
their 
capacity 
for 
displacement 
and 
in 
the 
danger 
of 
contagion 
from 
what 
is 
prohibited, 
4. 
and 
in 
the 
causation 
of

whichemanate

TabooandTouching—In 
its 
attempt 
to 
prevent 
associations 
from 
occurring, 
to 
obstruct 
the 
forming 
of 
connections 
in 
thought, 
the 
ego 
is 
complying 
with 
one 
of 
the 
oldest 
and 
most 
fundamental 
commandments 
of 
the 
compulsion 
neurosis, 
the 
taboo 
on 
touching. 
To 
the 
question 
why 
the 
avoidance 
of 
touching, 
contact 
or 
contagion 
plays 
so 
large 
a 
rôle 
in 
the 
neurosis 
and 
is 
made 
the 
content 
of 
so 
complicated 
a 
system, 
the 
answer 
is 
that 
touching, 
physical 
contact, 
is 
the 
most 
immediate 
aim 
of 
aggressive 
no 
less 
than 
of 
tender 
object-cathexes. 
Eros 
desires 
contact, 
for 
it 
strives 
for 
union, 
for 
the 
annihilation 
of 
spatial 
boundaries 
between 
ego 
and 
loved 
object. 
But 
destruction, 
too, 
which 
before 
the 
invention 
of 
long-range 
weapons 
could 
be 
effected 
only 
through 
proximity, 
necessarily 
presupposes 
physical 
contact, 
the 
use 
of 
the 
hands. 
To 
touch 
a 
woman 
has 
become 
in 
ordinary 
parlance 
a 
euphemism 
for 
her 
use 
as 
a 
sexual 
object. 
Not 
to 
touch 
the 
genital 
is 
the 
usual 
wording 
of 
the 
prohibition 
against 
autoerotic 
gratification. 
Since 
the 
compulsion 
neurosis 
sought 
to 
effect 
erotic 
contact 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
and 
then, 
subsequent 
to 
regression, 
the 
same 
contact 
disguised 
as 
aggression, 
nothing 
was 
taboo 
to 
it 
in 
such 
intense 
degree 
as 
this 
very 
contact,

TELEPATHY—You 
know 
that 
by 
telepathy 
we 
mean 
the 
alleged 
fact 
that 
an 
event 
which 
occurs 
at 
a 
specific 
time 
comes 
more 
or 
less 
simultaneously 
into 
the 
consciousness 
of 
a 
person 
who 
is 
spatially 
distant, 
without 
any 
of 
the 
known 
methods 
of 
communication 
coming 
into 
play. 
The 
tacit 
assumption 
is 
that 
this 
event 
occurs 
to 
a 
person, 
in 
whom 
the 
receiver 
of 
the 
message 
has 
some 
strong 
emotional 
interest.

I 
need 
not 
emphasize 
to 
you 
the 
improbability 
of 
such 
processes,

there 
are 
good 
reasons 
for

Have 
I

you 
the 
impression 
that 
I 
am 
secretly 
inclined 
to 
support 
the 
reality 
of 
telepathy 
in 
the 
occult 
sense? 
If 
so, 
I 
should 
very 
much 
regret 
that 
it 
is 
so 
difficult 
to 
avoid 
giving 
such 
an 
impression. 
In 
reality, 
however, 
I 
was 
anxious 
to 
be 
strictly 
impartial. 
I 
have 
every 
reason 
to 
be 
so, 
for 
I 
have 
no 
opinion;I 
know 
nothing 
about 
it.

Telepathy 
and 
Dream—Fundamentally 
the 
dream 
has 
but 
little 
to 
do 
with 
telepathy. 
Telepathy 
throws 
no 
new 
light 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
dream, 
nor 
does 
the 
dream 
bear 
witness 
for 
the 
reality 
of 
telepathy. 
Telepathic 
phenomena 
are 
also 
by 
no 
manner 
of 
means 
confined 
to 
dreams; 
they 
can 
also 
manifest 
themselves 
during 
waking 
life. 
The 
only 
ground 
for 
mentioning 
the 
connection 
between 
dreams 
and 
telepathy 
is 
that 
the 
condition 
of 
sleep 
seems 
to 
be 
especially 
suitable 
for 
the 
reception 
of 
telepathic 
communications. 
If 
then 
one 
comes 
across 
a 
so-called 
telepathic 
dream, 
one 
can 
convince 
oneself 
by 
its 
analysis 
that 
the 
telepathic 
message 
has 
played 
the 
same 
rôle 
as 
any 
other 
residue 
of 
waking 
life, 
and 
as 
such 
has 
been 
altered 
by 
the

you 
to

it

about 
telepathy,

the

of 
the 
dreams, 
the

ofthem.

TOTEMISM—Among 
the 
Australians 
the 
system 
of 
Totemism 
takes 
the 
place 
of 
all 
religious 
and 
social 
institutions. 
Australian 
tribes 
are 
divided 
into 
smaller 
septs 
or 
clans, 
each 
taking 
the 
name 
of 
its 
totem. 
Now 
what 
is 
a 
totem? 
As 
a 
rule 
it 
is 
an 
animal, 
either 
edible 
or 
harmless, 
or 
dangerous 
and 
feared; 
more 
rarely 
the 
totem 
is 
a 
plant 
or 
a 
force 
of 
nature 
(rain, 
water), 
which 
stands 
in 
a 
peculiar 
relation 
to 
the 
whole 
clan. 
The 
totem 
is 
first 
of 
all 
the 
tribal 
ancestor 
of 
the 
clan, 
as 
well 
as 
its 
tutelary 
spirit 
and 
protector; 
it 
sends 
oracles 
and, 
though 
otherwise 
dangerous, 
the 
totem 
knows 
and 
spares 
its 
children. 
The 
members 
of 
a 
totem 
are 
therefore 
under 
a 
sacred 
obligation 
not 
to 
kill 
(destroy) 
their 
totem, 
to 
abstain 
from 
eating 
its 
meat 
or 
from 
any 
other 
enjoyment 
of 
it. 
Any 
violation 
of 
these 
prohibitions 
is 
automatically 
punished. 
The 
character 
of 
a 
totem 
is 
inherent 
not 
only 
in 
a 
single 
animal 
or 
a 
single 
being 
but 
in 
all 
the 
members 
of 
the 
species. 
From 
time 
to 
time 
festivals 
are 
held 
at 
which 
the 
members 
of 
a 
totem 
represent 
or 
imitate, 
in 
ceremonial 
dances, 
the 
movements 
and 
characteristics 
of 
their 
totems. 
. 
. 
. 
We 
must 
consider 
that 
peculiarity 
of 
the 
totemic 
system 
which 
attracts 
the 
interest 
of 
the 
psychoanalyst. 
Almost 
everywhere 
where 
the 
totem 
prevails, 
there 
also 
exists 
the 
law 
that 
the 
members 
of 
the 
same 
totem 
are 
not 
allowed 
to 
enter 
into 
sexual 
relations 
with 
each 
other; 
that 
is, 
that 
they 
cannot 
marry 
each 
other.This

the

TRANSFERENCE 
(IN 
ANALYSIS)—The 
patient 
sees 
in 
his 
analyst 
the 
return—the 
reincarnation—of 
some 
important 
figure 
out 
of 
his 
childhood 
or 
past, 
and 
consequently 
transfers 
on 
to 
him 
feelings 
and 
reactions 
that 
undoubtedly 
applied 
to 
this 
model. 
It 
soon 
becomes 
evident 
that 
this 
fact 
of 
transference 
is 
a 
factor 
of 
undreamed-of 
importance—on 
the 
one 
hand 
an 
instrument 
of 
irreplaceable 
value 
and 
on 
the 
other 
a 
source 
of 
serious 
dangers. 
This 
transference 
is 
ambivalent: 
it 
comprises 
positive 
and 
affectionate 
as 
well 
as 
negative 
and 
hostile 
attitudes 
toward 
the 
analyst, 
who, 
as 
a 
rule, 
is 
put 
in 
the 
place 
of 
one 
or 
other 
of 
the 
patient’s 
parents, 
his 
father 
or 
his 
mother. 
So 
long 
as 
it 
is 
positive 
it 
serves 
us 
admirably. 
It 
alters 
the 
whole 
analytic 
situation 
and 
sidetracks 
the 
patient’s 
rational 
aim 
of 
becoming 
well 
and 
free 
from 
his 
troubles. 
Instead 
of 
it 
there 
emerges 
the 
aim 
of 
pleasing 
the 
analyst, 
of 
winning 
his 
applause 
and 
his 
love. 
This 
becomes 
the 
true 
motive-force 
for 
the 
patient’s 
collaboration; 
the 
weak 
ego 
becomes 
strong; 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
this 
aim 
the 
patient 
achieves 
things 
that 
would 
otherwise 
be 
beyond 
his 
power; 
his 
symptoms 
disappear 
and 
he 
seems 
to 



have 
recovered—all 
of 
this 
simply 
out 
of 
love 
for 
his 
analyst. 
. 
. 
. 
Therapeutic 
successes 
that 
take 
place 
under 
the 
sway 
of 
the 
positive 
transference 
are 
under 
the 
suspicion 
of 
being 
of 
a 
suggestive 
nature. 
If 
the 
negative 
transference 
gains 
the 
upper 
hand 
they 
are 
blown 
away 
like 
spray 
before 
the 
wind.

Trauma 
(Psychic) 
and 
the 
Formation 
of 
Neurosis—Our 
researches 
have 
shown 
that 
what 
we 
call 
the 
phenomena 
or 
symptoms 
of 
a 
neurosis 
are 
the 
consequences 
of 
certain 
experiences 
and 
impressions 
which, 
for 
this 
very 
reason, 
we 
recognize 
to 
be 
aetiological 
traumata. 
We 
wish 
to 
ascertain, 
even 
if 
only 
in 
a 
rough 
schematic 
way, 
the 
characteristics 
common 
to 
these 
experiencesand 
toneuroticsymptoms. 


Let 
us 
first 
consider 
the 
former. 
All 
these 
traumata 
belong 
to 
early 
childhood, 
the 
period 
up 
to 
about 
five 
years. 
Impressions 
during 
the 
time 



when 
the 
child 
begins 
to 
speak 
are 
found 
to 
be 
especially 
interesting. 
The 
period 
between 
two 
and 
four 
years 
is 
the 
most 
important. 
How 
soon 
after 
birth 
this 
sensitiveness 
to 
traumata 
begins 
we 
are 
not 
able 
to 
state 
with 
any 
degreeof 
certainty. 


M 
&M—PartIII, 
SectionI 


A 
trauma 
in 
childhood 
can 
be 
immediately 
followed 
by 
a 
neurosis 
during 
childhood; 
this 
constitutes 
an 
effort 
of 
defence 
accompanied 
by 
the 
formation 
ofsymptoms. 


M 
&M—PartIII, 
SectionI 


It 
may 
remain 
an 
open 
question 
whether 
the 
aetiology 
of 
the 
neuroses 
should 
in 
general 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
traumatic 
one. 
The 
obvious 
objection 
is 
that 
a 
trauma 
is 
not 
always 
evident 
in 
the 
early 
history 
of 
the 
neurotic 
individual. 
Often 
we 
must 
be 
content 
to 
say 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
else 
but 
an 
unusual 
reaction 
to 
experiences 
and 
demands 
that 
apply 
to 
all 
individuals; 
many 
people 
deal 
with 
them 
in 
another 
way 
which 
we 
may 
term 
normal. 
Where 
we 
can 
find 
no 
other 
explanation 
than 
a 
hereditary 
and 
constitutional 
disposition, 
we 
are 
naturally 
tempted 
to 
say 
that 
the 
neurosis 
was 
not 
suddenly 
acquired,butslowly 
developed. 


In 
this 
connection, 
however, 
two 
points 
stand 
out. 
The 
first 
is 
that 
the 
genesis 
of 
the 
neurosis 
always 
goes 
back 
to 
very 
early 
impressions 
in 
childhood. 
The 
second 
is 
this: 
it 
is 
correct 
to 
say 
that 
there 
are 
cases 
which 
we 
single 
out 
as 
“traumatic” 
ones 
because 
the 
effects 
unmistakably 
go 
back 
to 
one 
or 
more 
strong 
impressions 
of 
this 
early 
period. 
They 
failed 
to 
be 
disposed 
of 
normally, 
so 
that 
one 
feels 
inclined 
to 
say 
that 
if 
this 
or 
that 
had 
not 
happened, 
there 
would 
have 
been 
no 
neurosis. 
It 
would 
be 
sufficient 
for 
our 
purposes 
even 
if 
we 
had 
to 
limit 
the 
analogy 
in 
question 
to 
the 
traumatic 
cases.

any

the

Unconscious 
andPreconscious—There 
are 
two 
kinds 
of 
unconscious,which 
have 
not 
as 
yet 
been 
distinguished 
by 
psychologists. 
Both 
are 
unconscious 
in 
the 
psychological 
sense; 
but 
in 
our 
sense 
the 
first, 
which 
we 
call 
Ucs., 
is 
likewise 
incapable 
of 
consciousness; 
whereas 
the 
second 
we 
call 
Pcs. 
because 
its 
excitations, 
after 
the 
observance 
of 
certain 
rules, 
are 
capable 
of 
reaching 
consciousness; 
perhaps 
not 
before 
they 
have 
again 
undergone 
censorship, 
but 
nevertheless 
regardless 
of 
the 
Ucs. 
system. 
The 
fact 
that 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
consciousness 
the 
excitations 
must 
pass 
through 
an 
unalterable 
series, 
a 
succession 
of 
instances, 
as 
is 
betrayed 
by 
the 
changes 
produced 
in 
them 
by 
the 
censorship, 
has 
enabled 
us 
to 
describe 
them 
by 
analogy 
in 
spatial 
terms. 
We 
described 
the 
relations 
of 
the 
two 
systems 
to 
each 
other 
and 
to 
consciousness 
by 
saying 
that 
the 
system 
Pcs. 
is 
like 
a 
screen 
between 
the 



system 
Ucs. 
and 
consciousness. 
The 
system 
Pcs. 
not 
only 
bars 
access 
to 
consciousness, 
but 
also 
controls 
the 
access 
to 
voluntary 
motility, 
and 
has 
control 
of 
the 
emission 
of 
a 
mobile 
cathectic 
energy, 
a 
portion 
of 
which 
is 
familiar

UNCONSCIOUS

TIMELESSNESS 
OF—We 
have 
found 
by 
experience 
that 
unconscious 
mental 
processes 
are 
in 
themselves 
“timeless.” 
That 
is 
to 
say 
to 
begin 
with: 
they 
are 
not 
arranged 
chronologically, 
time 
alters 
nothing 
in 
them, 
nor 
can 
the 
idea 
of

UNDOING—It 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
negative 
magic 
which 
by 
means 
of 
a 
motor 
symbolism 
would 
“blow 
away,” 
as 
it 
were, 
not 
the 
consequences 
of 
an 
event 
(an 
impression, 
an 
experience), 
but 
the 
event 
itself. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
effort 
at 
“undoing” 
finds 
its 
reflection 
in 
the 
normal 
sphere 
in 
the 
resolve 
to 
treat 
an 
occurrence 
as 
non 
arrivé; 
but 
in 
this 
case 
one 
does 
not 
take 
up 
arms 
against 
it, 
one 
is 
simply 
not 
concerned 
about 
either 
the 
occurrence 
or 
its 
consequences; 
whereas 
in 
neurosis 
the 
attempt 
is 
made 
to 
abrogate 
the 
past 
itself, 
to 
repress 
it 
by 
motor 
means. 
An 
effort 
of 
the 
same 
sort 
may 
provide 
the 
explanation 
of 
the 
compulsion 
to 
repetition 
so 
frequently 
present 
in 
neurosis, 
a 
repetition 
in 
the 
carrying 
out 
of 
which 
various 
mutually 
contradictory 
purposes 
are 
commingled. 
.

The 
striving 
to 
“undo” 
a 
traumatic 
experience 
is 
often 
revealed 
as 
a

of 
the

UNPLEASURE—The

The

the

WELTANSCHAUUNG—“Weltanschauung” 
is, 
I 
am 
afraid, 
a 
specifically 
German 
notion, 
which 
it 
would 
be 
difficult 
to 
translate 
into 
a 
foreign 
language. 
If 
I 
attemptto 
give 
you 
adefinition 
ofthe 
word,itcanhardlyfailto 
strike 
you 
as 
inept. 
By 
Weltanschauung, 
then, 
I 
mean 
an 
intellectual 



construction, 
which 
gives 
a 
unified 
solution 
of 
all 
the 
problems 
of 
our 
existence 
in 
virtue 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
hypothesis, 
a 
construction, 
therefore, 
in 
which 
no 
question 
is 
left 
open 
and 
in 
which 
everything 
in 
which 
we 
are 
interested 
finds 
a 
place. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
see 
that 
the 
possession 
of 
such 
a 
Weltanschauung 
is 
one 
of 
the 
ideal 
wishes 
of 
mankind. 
When 
one 
believes 
in 
such 
a 
thing, 
one 
feels 
secure 
in 
life, 
one 
knows 
what 
one 
ought 
to 
strive 
after, 
and 
how 
one 
ought 
to

one’s

sphere

WRU—ch. 
VII 


Though 
wit-making 
is 
an 
excellent 
means 
of 
obtaining 
pleasure 
from 
the 
psychic 
processes, 
we 
know 
that 
not 
all 
persons 
are 
equally 
able 
to 
make 
use 
of 
it. 
Wit-making 
is 
not 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
all, 
in 
general 
there 
are 
but 
a 
few 
persons 
to 
whom 
one 
can 
point 
and 
say 
that 
they 
are 
witty. 
Here 
wit 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
special 
ability 
somewhere 
within 
the 
region 
of 
the 
old 
“psychic 
faculties,” 
and 
this 
shows 
itself 
in 
its 
appearance 
as 
fairly 
independent 
of 
the 
otherfacultiessuchas 
intelligence, 
phantasy,memory, 
etc. 
A 
specialtalent 
or

or

wit-making 
must 
be

WRU—ch. 
V 


It 
has 
seemed 
to 
us 
that 
the 
pleasure 
of 
wit 
originates 
from 
an 
economy 
of 
expenditure 
in 
inhibition, 
of 
the 
comic 
from 
an 
economy 
of 
expenditure 
in 
thought, 
and 
of 
humor 
from 
an 
economy 
of 
expenditure 
in 
feeling. 
All 
three 
modes 
of 
activity 
of 
our 
psychic 
apparatus 
derive 
pleasure 
from 
economy. 
All 
three 
present 
methods 
strive 
to 
bring 
back 
from 
the 
psychic 
activity 
a 
pleasure 
which 
has 
really 
been 
lost 
in 
the 
development 
of 
this 
activity. 
For 
the 
euphoria 
which 
we 
are 
thus 
striving 
to 
obtain 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
state 
of 
a 



bygone 
time, 
in 
which 
we 
were 
wont 
to 
defray 
our 
psychic 
work 
with 
slight 
expenditure. 
It 
is 
the 
state 
of 
our 
childhood 
in 
which 
we 
did

WRU—ch. 
VII 


Wit 
and 
Dream—The 
most 
important 
difference 
lies 
in. 
their 
social 
behavior. 
The 
dream 
is 
a 
perfectly 
asocial 
psychic 
product. 
It 
has 
nothing 
to 
tell 
to 
anyone 
else, 
having 
originated 
in 
an 
individual 
as 
a 
compromise 
between 
conflicting 
psychic 
forces 
it 
remains 
incomprehensible 
to 
the 
person 
himself 
and 
has 
therefore 
altogether 
no 
interest 
for 
anybody 
else. 
Not 
only 
does 
the 
dream 
find 
it 
unnecessary 
to 
place 
any 
value 
on 
intelligibleness, 
but 
it 
must 
even 
guard 
against 
being 
understood, 
as 
it 
would 
then 
be 
destroyed; 
it 
can 
only 
exist 
in 
disguised 
form. 
For 
this 
reason 
the 
dream 
may 
make 
use 
freely 
of 
the 
mechanism 
that 
controls 
unconscious 
thought 
processes 
to 
the 
extent 
of 
producing 
undecipherable 
distortions. 
Wit, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
is 
the 
most 
social 
of 
all 
those 
psychic 
functions 
whose 
aim 
is 
to 
gain 
pleasure. 
It 
often 
requires 
three 
persons, 
and 
the 
psychic 
process 
which 
it 
incites 
always 
requires 
the 
participation 
of 
at 
least 
one 
other 
person. 
It 
must 
therefore 
bind 
itself 
to 
the 
condition 
of 
intelligibleness; 
it 
may 
employ 
distortion 
made 
practicable 
in 
the 
unconscious 
through 
condensation 
and 
displacement, 
to 
no 
greater 
extent 
than 
can 
be 
deciphered 
by 
the 
intelligence 
of 
the 
third 
person. 
As 
for 
the 
rest, 
wit 
and 
dreams 
have 
developed 
in 
altogether 
different 
spheres 
of 
the 
psychic 
life, 
and 
are 
to 
be 
classed 
under 
widely 
separated 
categories 
of 
the 
psychological 
system. 
No 
matter 
how 
concealed, 
the 
dream 
is 
still 
a 
wish, 
while 
wit 
is 
a 
developed 
play. 
Despite 
its 
apparent 
unreality, 
the 
dream 
retains 
its 
relation 
to 
the 
great 
interests 
of 
life; 
it 
seeks 
to 
supply 
what 
is 
lacking 
through 
a 
regressive 
detour 
of 
hallucinations; 
and 
it 
owes 
its 
existence 
solely 
to 
the 
strong 
need 
for 
sleep 
during 
the 
night. 
Wit, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
seeks 
to 
draw 
a 
small 
amount 
of 
pleasure 
from 
the 
free 
and 
unencumbered 
activities 
of 
our 
psychic 
apparatus, 
and 
later 
to 
seize 
this 
pleasure 
as 
an 
incidental 
gain. 
It 
thus 
secondarily 
reaches 
to 
important 
functions 
relative 
to 
the 
outer 
world. 
The 
dream 
serves 
preponderantly 
to 
guard 
against 
pain, 
while 
wit 
serves 
to 
acquire 
pleasure; 
in 
these 
two 
aims 
all 
ourpsychicactivitiesmeet.

As 
we 
know 
that 
displacements 
in 
dream-work 
point 
to 
the 
influence 
of 
censorship 
of 
conscious 
thought, 
we 
will 
consequently 
be 
inclined 
to 
assume 
that 
an 
inhibiting 
force 
also 
plays 
a 
part 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
wit 
when 
we 
find 



the 
process 
of 
displacement 
among 
the 
techniques 
of 
wit. 
We 
also 
know 
that 
this 
is 
commonly 
the 
case; 
the 
endeavor 
of 
wit 
to 
revive 
the 
old 
pleasure 
in 
nonsense 
or 
the 
old 
pleasure 
in 
word-play 
meets 
with 
resistance 
in 
every 
normal 
state, 
a 
resistance 
which 
is 
exerted 
by 
the 
protest 
of 
critical 
reason, 
and 
whichmust 
beovercome 
ineachindividualcase. 
Butaradicaldistinction 
between 
wit 
and 
dreams 
is 
shown 
in 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
the 
wit-work 
solves 
this 
difficulty. 
In 
the 
dream-work 
the 
solution 
of 
this 
task 
is 
brought 
about 
regularly 
through 
displacements 
and 
through 
the 
choice 
of 
ideas 
which 
are 
remote 
enough 
from 
those 
objectionable 
to 
secure 
passage 
through 
the 
censorship; 
the 
latter 
themselves 
are 
but 
offsprings 
of 
those 
whose 
psychic 
cathexis 
they 
have 
taken 
over 
through 
full 
transference. 
The 
displacements 
are, 
therefore, 
not 
lacking 
in 
any 
dream 
and 
are 
far 
more 
comprehensive. 
They 
not 
only 
include 
the 
deviations 
from 
the 
trend 
of 
thought, 
but 
also 
all 
forms 
of 
indirect 
expression, 
especially 
the 
substitution 
for 
an 
important 
but 
offensive 
element 
by 
one 
indifferent 
and 
seemingly 
harmless 
to 
the 
censorship,whichthenlooks 
like 
a 
most 
remoteallusion 
to 
the 
first; 
they 
also 
include 
substitution 
through 
symbols, 
comparisons, 
or 
trifles. 
It 
is 
not 
to 
be 
denied 
that 
parts 
of 
this 
indirect 
representation 
really 
originate 
in 
the 
foreconscious 
thoughts 
of 
the 
dream—as, 
for 
example, 
symbolical 
representation 
and 
representation 
through 
comparisons—because 
otherwise 
the 
thought 
would 
not 
have 
reached 
the 
state 
of 
the 
foreconscious 
expression. 
Such 
indirect 
expressions 
and 
allusions, 
whose 
reference 
to 
the 
original 
thought 
is 
easily 
detectable, 
are 
really 
permissible 
and 
customary 
means 
of 
expression 
even 
in 
our 
conscious 
thought. 
The 
dream-work, 
however, 
exaggerates 
the 
application 
of 
these 
means 
of 
indirect 
expression 
to 
an 
unlimited 
degree. 
Under 
the 
pressure 
of 
the 
censor 
any 
kind 
of 
association 
becomes 
good 
enough 
for 
substitution 
by 
allusion; 
the 
displacement 
from 
one 
element 
to 
any 
other 
is 
permitted. 
The 
substitution 
of 
the 
inner 
associations 
(similarity, 
causal 
connection, 
etc.) 
by 
the 
so-called 
outer 
associations 
(simultaneity, 
contiguity 
in 
space, 
assonance) 
is 
particularly 
conspicuous 
and

We 
attribute 
to 
women 
a 
greater 
amount 
of 
narcissism 
(and 
this 
influences 
their 
object-choice) 
so 
that 
for 
them 
to 
be 
loved 
is 
a 
stronger 
need 
than 
to 
love. 
Their 
vanity 
is 
partly 
a 
further 
effect 
of 
penis-envy, 
for 
they 
are 
driven 
to 
rate 
their 
physical 
charms 
more 
highly 
as 
a 
belated 
compensation 
for 
their 
original 
sexual 
inferiority. 
Modesty, 
which 
is 
regarded 
as 
a 
feminine 
characteristic 
par 
excellence, 
but 
is 
far 
more 
a 
matter 
of 
convention 
than 
one 
would 
think, 
was,in 
our 
opinion,originally

WORDS 
[cf.

not,

words. 
They 
are 
a 
mighty 
instrument, 
the 
means 
by 
which 
we 
convey 
our 
feelings, 
the 
way 
by 
which 
we 
influence 
others. 
Words 
can 
do 
unutterable 
good, 
and 
appalling 
harm. 
No 
doubt, 
in 
the 
beginning 
was 
the 
deed—the 
word 
came 
later; 
in 
some 
contexts 
it 
was 
a 
cultural 
advance 
when 
deeds 
were 
moderated 
to 
words.

ZOOPHOBIA, 
INFANTILE—The 
relation 
of 
the 
child 
to 
animals 
has 
muchincommonwiththatofprimitiveman. 
Thechilddoesnotyet 
show 
any 
trace 
of 
the 
pride 
which 
afterwards 
moves 
the 
adult 
civilized 
man 
to 
set 
a 
sharp 
dividing 
line 
between 
his 
own 
nature 
and 
that 
of 
all 
other 
animals. 
The 
child 
unhesitatingly 
attributes 
full 
equality 
to 
animals; 
he 
probably 
feels 
himselfmorecloselyrelatedto 
theanimalthantotheundoubtedlymysterious 
adult,in 
the 
freedomwithwhichheacknowledgeshis 
needs. 


Not 
infrequently 
a 
curious 
disturbance 
manifests 
itself 
in 
this 
excellent 
understanding 
between 
child 
and 
animal. 
The 
child 
suddenly 
begins 
to 
fear 
a 
certain 
animal 
species 
and 
to 
protect 
himself 
against 
seeing 
or 
touching 
any 
individual 
of 
this 
species. 
There 
results 
the 
clinical 
picture 
of 
an 
animal 
phobia, 
which 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
frequent 
among 
the 
psychoneurotic 
diseases 
of 
this 
age 
and 
perhaps 
the 
earliest 
form 
of 
such 
an 
ailment. 
The 
phobia 
is 
as 
a 
rule 
in 
regard 
to 
animals 
for 
which 
the 
child 
has 
until 
then 
shown 
the 
liveliest 
interestand 
has 
nothing 
todo 
with 
theindividual 
animal. 
In 
cities 
the 
choice 
of 
animals 
which 
can 
become 
the 
object 
of 
phobia 
is 
not 
great. 
They 
are 
horses, 
dogs, 
cats, 
more 
seldom 
birds, 
and 
strikingly 
often 
very 
small 
animals 
like 
bugs 
and 
butterflies. 
Sometimes 
animals 
which 
are 
known 
to 
the 
child 
only 
from 
picture 
books 
and 
fairy 
stories 
become 
objects 
of 
the 
senseless 
and 
inordinate 
anxiety 
which 
is 
manifested 
with 
these 
phobias; 
it 
is 
seldom 
possible 
to 
learn 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
such 
an 
unusual 
choice 
of 
anxiety 
has 
been 
brought 
about. 
I 
am 
indebted 
to 
Dr. 
Karl 
Abraham 
for 
the 
report 
of 
a 
case 
in 
which 
the 
child 
itself 
explained 
its 
fear 
of 
wasps 
by 
saying 
that 
the 
colour 
and 
the 
stripes 
of 
the 
body 
of 
the 
wasp 
had 
made 
it 
think 
of 
thetigerofwhich,fromallthatit 
hadheard,itmightwellbeafraid. 


Theanimalphobias 
havenotyetbeenmadethe 
objectofcareful 
analytical 
investigation, 
although 
they 
very 
much 
merit 
it. 
The 
difficulties 
of 
analysing 
children 
of 
so 
tender 
an 
age 
have 
probably 
been 
the 
motive 
of 
such 
neglect. 
It 
cannot 
therefore 
be 
asserted 
that 
the 
general 
meaning 
of 
these 
illnesses 
is 
known, 
and 
I 
myself 
do 
not 
think 
that 
it 
would 
turn 
out 
to 
be 
the 
same 
in 
all 



cases. 
But 
a 
number 
of 
such 
phobias 
directed 
against 
larger 
animals 
have 
proved 
accessible 
to 
analysis 
and 
have 
thus 
betrayed 
their 
secret 
to 
the 
investigator. 
In 
every 
case 
it 
was 
the 
same: 
the 
fear 
at 
bottom 
was 
of 
the 
father, 
if 
the 
children 
examined 
were 
boys, 
and 
was 
merely 
displaced 
upon 
theanimal.

In 
infantile 
zoöphobias, 
the 
ego 
must 
intervene 
against 
a 
libidinal 
objectcathexis 
of 
the 
id 
(that 
of 
the 
positive 
or 
negative 
oedipus 
complex, 
namely), 
because 
of 
the 
recognition 
that 
to 
yield 
to 
it 
would 
entail 
the 
danger 
of 
castration. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
castration 
anxiety 
is 
given 
another 
object 
and 
a 
distorted 
expression—namely, 
that 
of 
being 
bitten 
by 
a 
horse 
(or 
eaten 
by 
a 
wolf) 
instead 
of 
being 
castrated 
by 
the 
father. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
anxiety 
in 
zoöphobia 
is 
thus 
an 
affective 
reaction 
of 
the 
ego 
to 
danger, 
the 
danger 
which 
is 
in 
this 
case 
warnedagainstbeingthat 
ofcastration.
