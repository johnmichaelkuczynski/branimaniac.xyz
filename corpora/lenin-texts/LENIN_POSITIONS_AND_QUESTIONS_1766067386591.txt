# Lenin's Writings: 20 Topics with 20 Contentions Each

---

## 1. IMPERIALISM

1. Imperialism is the highest and final stage of capitalism, characterized by the dominance of monopolies over free competition.
2. The export of capital, rather than commodities, becomes the defining feature of imperialist economies.
3. Finance capital—the merger of bank and industrial capital—constitutes the economic foundation of imperialism.
4. Capitalist powers inevitably divide the world into spheres of influence proportional to their economic strength.
5. Colonial super-profits enable the bourgeoisie to bribe a labor aristocracy in advanced countries.
6. Imperialist wars are inevitable consequences of capitalism's need to re-divide already-divided markets.
7. The distinction between "good" and "bad" colonialism is a liberal fiction; all colonialism serves capital accumulation.
8. Imperialism creates the objective conditions for socialist revolution by intensifying contradictions globally.
9. The uneven development of capitalism means revolution may occur first in the "weakest links" of the imperialist chain.
10. Kautsky's theory of "ultra-imperialism" (peaceful capitalist cooperation) is theoretically impossible and politically dangerous.
11. National liberation movements in colonies are objectively revolutionary regardless of their class leadership.
12. Imperialist countries' workers benefit materially from colonialism, creating reformist tendencies in their movements.
13. The parasitism of rentier states represents capitalism's decay rather than its progressive development.
14. Monopoly capitalism does not eliminate competition but raises it to a higher, more destructive level.
15. Finance capital's dominance makes the separation of "productive" and "speculative" capital meaningless.
16. Imperialism demonstrates capitalism's socialization of production while maintaining private appropriation.
17. Colonial peoples constitute a revolutionary reserve army against the imperialist bourgeoisie.
18. The World War revealed imperialism's barbaric essence beneath its civilizational rhetoric.
19. Imperialist peace is merely preparation for imperialist war; both serve capital's interests.
20. Imperialism's epoch is one of wars and revolutions; reformist gradualism becomes objectively counterrevolutionary.

## 2. THE STATE

1. The state is an organ of class domination, arising from irreconcilable class antagonisms.
2. The bourgeois state, regardless of its democratic form, remains a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.
3. The standing army and police constitute the principal instruments of state power.
4. Parliamentary democracy serves to manage intra-bourgeois conflicts while excluding workers from real power.
5. The proletariat cannot simply seize the existing state machinery; it must smash it.
6. Engels' formula of the state's "withering away" applies only after proletarian revolution, not before.
7. Anarchists err in wanting to abolish the state overnight; Marxists recognize the necessity of transitional state forms.
8. The bourgeois state must be replaced by a proletarian semi-state that immediately begins its own dissolution.
9. Bureaucracy is not a neutral administrative apparatus but a material force serving ruling-class interests.
10. Universal suffrage under capitalism decides only which representatives of the oppressing class will misrepresent the oppressed.
11. The commune-state (Paris Commune model) represents the discovered political form for proletarian rule.
12. Separation of powers doctrine obscures the unity of bourgeois class rule behind formal divisions.
13. The state's repressive apparatus grows as class contradictions sharpen, regardless of democratic forms.
14. "Pure democracy" is a fiction; all democracy is class democracy serving particular class interests.
15. The dictatorship of the proletariat is a million times more democratic than bourgeois democracy for the majority.
16. State power over economic life grows under imperialism, facilitating the transition to socialist planning.
17. The democratic republic is the ideal shell for capitalism but remains a form of bourgeois dictatorship.
18. Revolutionary periods require the concentration of state power, not its immediate dispersion.
19. The proletarian state differs qualitatively from all previous states in aiming at its own supersession.
20. Opportunists distort Marxism by treating the state as a neutral arbiter between classes.

## 3. REVOLUTION

1. Revolution is not a coup but the resolution of accumulated contradictions through mass action.
2. Revolutionary situations arise when the ruling class cannot rule in the old way and the masses refuse to live in the old way.
3. Spontaneous mass movements are necessary but insufficient; conscious organization determines victory or defeat.
4. The ruling class never voluntarily surrenders power; violence is the midwife of revolutionary transformation.
5. Insurrection is an art requiring precise timing; premature action is as fatal as hesitation.
6. Revolutionary crises ripen objectively; the subjective factor is the party's readiness to act.
7. Dual power—parallel proletarian and bourgeois authority—is inherently unstable and must resolve in one direction.
8. The transfer of power to soviets represents the revolution's completion in its political dimension.
9. Opportunists substitute "evolutionary" transformation for revolution, betraying working-class interests.
10. Revolutionary defeatism—desiring one's own government's defeat in imperialist war—is the internationalist position.
11. The bourgeois-democratic revolution can grow over into socialist revolution without an intervening historical stage.
12. Peasant support is essential for revolution in agrarian countries but proletarian hegemony must be maintained.
13. International revolution is necessary for socialism's full realization; national revolution begins the process.
14. Counter-revolution follows revolution as its shadow; revolutionaries must prepare for civil war.
15. The masses learn through revolutionary experience, not prior theoretical instruction.
16. Compromises are permissible tactically but never on fundamental revolutionary principles.
17. Revolutionary periods compress historical development; decades happen in weeks.
18. The party must neither lag behind mass consciousness nor run too far ahead of it.
19. Every revolution faces the question: which class holds state power?
20. Revolution requires breaking legality; legal methods alone perpetuate bourgeois rule.

---

## 4. THE VANGUARD PARTY

1. The working class spontaneously develops only trade-union consciousness, not revolutionary consciousness.
2. Socialist consciousness must be brought to the working class from without by revolutionary intellectuals.
3. The party must be composed of professional revolutionaries, not part-time activists.
4. Democratic centralism combines free internal debate with unified external action.
5. A party newspaper serves as collective organizer, propagandist, and agitator.
6. Small, disciplined organizations outperform large, amorphous movements in revolutionary situations.
7. The distinction between party members and sympathizers must be rigorously maintained.
8. Party discipline is not mechanical obedience but conscious acceptance of collective decisions.
9. Opportunism in the workers' movement reflects bourgeois influence; the party must combat it relentlessly.
10. The party represents the most advanced section of the class, not the class as a whole.
11. Ideological unity is the precondition for organizational unity; eclecticism produces paralysis.
12. The party must master all forms of struggle—legal and illegal, peaceful and violent.
13. Factionalism, once a decision is made, threatens party unity and revolutionary effectiveness.
14. Cadre selection and training constitutes the party's most important ongoing task.
15. The party must maintain independence from bourgeois parties, including liberal and reformist ones.
16. Mass organizations (unions, soviets) differ from the party in composition and function.
17. Party membership requires acceptance of the program and active participation in party organizations.
18. The party's relationship to the class is one of leadership, not substitution.
19. Theoretical work is a party responsibility, not merely an individual intellectual pursuit.
20. The party must be refounded in each country on revolutionary Marxist principles.

---

## 5. MATERIALISM AND PHILOSOPHY

1. Matter is primary; consciousness is a property of highly organized matter (the brain).
2. The external world exists independently of human perception and cognition.
3. Human knowledge reflects objective reality, however imperfectly and progressively.
4. Sensation is the transformation of external stimuli into subjective experience, not a barrier to knowledge.
5. Idealism, in all its variants, serves ruling-class interests by mystifying reality.
6. Agnosticism is shame-faced idealism; denying knowability serves the same function as denying existence.
7. Machism (empirio-criticism) represents idealist philosophy in scientific disguise.
8. The criterion of practice is the ultimate test of truth.
9. Absolute and relative truth are dialectically related; knowledge progresses through accumulating relative truths.
10. Natural science spontaneously tends toward materialism; idealist interpretations are imposed from without.
11. The "thing-in-itself" is knowable; the distinction between phenomenon and essence is relative, not absolute.
12. Objective truth exists; rejecting it leads to solipsism and reaction.
13. Philosophical partisanship is unavoidable; neutrality between materialism and idealism is impossible.
14. Modern physics confirms materialism despite idealist misinterpretations by some physicists.
15. The unity of the world consists in its materiality, not in abstract Being.
16. Space and time are objective forms of material existence, not subjective intuitions.
17. Causality is an objective relation in nature, not merely a mental habit.
18. Freedom is the recognition of necessity; understanding causal laws enables purposive action.
19. Reflection theory does not imply passive copying; cognition is an active, practical process.
20. Philosophy without natural science is empty; natural science without philosophy is blind.

## 6. DIALECTICS

1. Dialectics is the study of contradiction in the essence of things themselves.
2. The unity and struggle of opposites is the fundamental law of dialectics.
3. Quantitative changes accumulate until they produce qualitative transformations.
4. Negation of the negation represents development's spiral character, not circular return.
5. Abstract identity (A=A) is inadequate; concrete identity includes difference and contradiction.
6. Motion is contradiction; a moving body is simultaneously in a place and not in that place.
7. Development proceeds through the interpenetration of opposites, not their external opposition.
8. The particular contains the universal; analysis must move from abstract to concrete.
9. Essence appears; appearance is essential—the task is to grasp their unity.
10. Dialectical logic supersedes formal logic without abolishing its limited validity.
11. Categories are not fixed pigeonholes but fluid forms reflecting objective connections.
12. Leaps interrupt gradual development; revolutionary breaks are ontologically grounded.
13. Contradiction is the source of all movement and development.
14. Hegel's dialectics must be inverted; the rational kernel extracted from the mystical shell.
15. The history of philosophy is the history of the dialectical development of human thought.
16. Eclecticism substitutes "on the one hand, on the other hand" for dialectical synthesis.
17. Cognition moves from living observation to abstract thought to practice in an endless spiral.
18. The relative and the absolute are dialectically interconnected, not metaphysically separated.
19. Analysis and synthesis are complementary moments in the dialectical method.
20. Dogmatism freezes dialectics; sophistry exploits flexibility to evade definite conclusions.

1. Commodity production reaches its highest development under capitalism but contains its own negation.
2. The law of value operates through market fluctuations, not despite them.
3. Surplus value—unpaid labor—is the source of capitalist profit.
4. The tendency of the rate of profit to fall drives capitalism's inherent instability.
5. Monopoly does not abolish competition but intensifies its destructive character.
6. Economic crises are not accidental but necessary expressions of capitalism's contradictions.
7. Finance capital represents the fusion of banking and industrial monopoly capital.
8. State-monopoly capitalism—the merger of monopolies with state power—characterizes imperialism.
9. Capitalist development creates its own gravediggers by concentrating and organizing the proletariat.
10. The agrarian question under capitalism involves differentiation of the peasantry into classes.
11. Primitive accumulation continues through imperialist extraction from colonies.
12. The working day's limits are set by class struggle, not natural necessity.

7. Federation is appropriate for multinational socialist states; centralism in party organization.
8. Cultural-national autonomy (Bund position) substitutes cultural isolation for political self-determination.
9. National movements contain both bourgeois and proletarian elements; support the latter.
10. Colonial liberation movements are objectively revolutionary against imperialism.
11. The Irish question demonstrated that no nation oppressing another can itself be free.

16. Rosa Luxemburg erred in dismissing self-determination as bourgeois nationalism.
17. Small nations' independence is utopian under imperialism but achievable under socialism.
18. Proletarian internationalism requires the voluntary union of nations, not forced incorporation.

20. The Soviet federation model combines national self-determination with socialist construction.

---

## 9. RELIGION

1. Religion is the opium of the people—a palliative for real suffering, not merely elite conspiracy.
2. Atheism is a consequence of materialism; fighting religion without fighting its social roots is futile.
3. The separation of church and state is a minimum democratic demand.
4. The party program includes atheism; religious believers can join if they accept the program.
5. Militant atheism must accompany socialist construction to combat religious backwardness.

13. The proletarian struggle is inherently atheistic in its implications.
14. Religion's persistence reflects incomplete socialist transformation, not permanent human needs.
15. Scientific worldview education is essential for overcoming religious consciousness.
16. Anti-religious propaganda must be tactful, avoiding offense that strengthens religious attachment.
17. The alliance of throne and altar reflects the material interests of exploiting classes.
18. Tolstoyanism's passive resistance mystifies class struggle and serves reaction.
19. Religious freedom in the bourgeois sense means freedom for bourgeois-backed churches.
20. The complete withering of religion requires the complete withering of class society.

---

## 10. WAR

1. Wars have definite class characters; the distinction between just and unjust wars is fundamental.
2. Imperialist wars are unjust on all sides; revolutionary defeatism is the correct position.
3. National defense wars by oppressed nations against imperialism are just.
4. Civil war is a continuation of class struggle by other means.
5. Revolutionary wars to defend workers' states are just.
6. Pacifism disarms the proletariat morally and physically; it serves imperialism.

7. Union bureaucracy reflects bourgeois influence in the workers' movement.
8. Revolutionaries must win union leadership through patient work, not ultimatums.
9. Yellow (company) unions serve capital directly; struggle against them is essential.

1. The peasantry is not a single class but a differentiated population including rural bourgeoisie and proletariat.
2. Alliance with the poor and middle peasantry is essential for revolution in agrarian countries.
3. The proletariat must lead the worker-peasant alliance; peasant leadership produces bourgeois outcomes.
4. Land nationalization is the maximum agrarian program; land distribution is tactically necessary.
